Kessinger*\n## I. Introduction\nAt any given time, millions upon millions of people connect to each other via cyberspace.¹ While a convenient method for grandparents to view pictures of their grandchildren, the Internet is also an exceedingly effective vehicle by which to attack a state, a company, or an individual. These attacks occur with frightening frequency, over 1,000 per hour in Great Britain alone²; and Britain recognizes the severity of the cyber threat.³ In the first four days of the November 2012 fighting between Israel and Gaza militants, over 44 million attacks on Israeli websites⁴ and an estimated 100 million total attacks occurred.⁵ Cyber-attacks cost Australia “an average of $2 million per incident” and exceed a billion dollars per year.⁶ Successful attacks also occur against international bodies, such as the International Atomic Energy Agency.⁷ These cyber attacks seek not only military targets, but also industrial espionage.⁸\nDespite the frequency and increasing severity of cyber attacks,⁹ many governments and industries around the world, to include the United States, are either seemingly helpless against the cyber onslaught,¹⁰ too dysfunctional¹¹ to create a useful offensive or defensive cyber scheme,¹² or are “highly immature with limited vision and strategic foresight.”¹³ Some foreign jurisdictions, our allies¹⁴ in the fight against cyber-attacks, fail to stem the tide of these attacks and now punish the cyber victims.¹⁵\nThis article explores the improbable, if not politically impossible, application of the letter of marque concept to the cyber arena. Despite the likely political stigma such a proposition would have in today’s Congress, letters of marque are nevertheless a constitutional and valid tool to execute cyber operations, and thus worthy of discussion.\nProposed defenses to cyber attacks are becoming increasingly complex and bizarre.¹⁶ However, one\n* U.S. Army, Judge Advocate.

Militarily, the government retains control over the letter of marque holder (a \"privateer\") and responsibilities as delineated within the express terms of the letter of marque while at the same time broadening the military's reach.$^{19}$ As a law enforcement tool, a letter of marque deputizes an individual or company, thus vesting that entity with police powers. This authority allows the privateer to detain targets, bring them before the sovereign, and receive compensation based on successes, much like a bounty hunter.$^{20}$ Using civilian forces in a military/national defense context is not a concept limited to antiquity. For example, monitored non-governmental civilian participation in governmental operations exists with private military contractors. The United States spent over $300 billion on military contractors from 2001–2007.$^{21}$\nThere is an apparent aversion to the use of letter of marque and privateers.$^{22}$ Various bills introduced throughout\nthe years proposing the revival of letter of marque have stalled or failed outright.$^{23}$ Despite the hesitation, letters of marque and privateers served a legitimate military purpose,$^{24}$ both in supplementing regular combat forces and crippling enemy commerce while protecting American commerce.$^{25}$ A cyber letter of marque would enable a privateer to seize digital assets, disrupt fiscal and communication networks, destroy attacking networks,$^{26}$ and act as a cyber bounty hunter.\nApplying a letter of marque scheme to the cyber world would not only provide authority for American companies to defend themselves from cyber threats, but also allow them to take proactive measures to neutralize a cyber threat before it coalesces into danger. In addition to providing requisite authorization, a letter of marque scheme would regulate the conduct of a prospective cyber privateer and ensure accountability to effect compliance with the letter of marque's mandate.\nPart II of this article examines the historical usage of letters of marque and privateers. A brief historical discussion shows the use of letters of marque in national defense. Such historical perspective provides a useful background when considering their application to cyberspace. Part III applies legal and historical principles to a modern letter of marque regime. In particular, the application of letters of marque within the context of existing technologies and proposed authorization and oversight safeguards are examined. The various laws implicated in a modern cyber letter of marque regime are reviewed in Part IV. Finally, Part V addresses the authorizations and oversight necessary to effectively manage a successful, and lawful, cyber letter of marque regime. While not meant to be an exhaustive analysis of all possible facets related to the implementation of a cyber letter of marque regime, this article shows that despite some initial political and legal issues, using a cyber letter of marque can effectively mitigate the threats posed by cyber attacks.\n## II. History of Letter of Marque and Privateering\nThe concept of allowing private individuals to wage war on a foreign sovereign is not new, nor is it unique to United\nAUGUST 2013 • THE ARMY LAWYER • DA PAM 27-50-483\nStates history. The letter of marque²⁷ and privateering concepts have been a part of both international law and the accepted norms of warfare for centuries,²⁸ despite the Declaration of Paris—which purportedly banned privateering.²⁹ Hugo Grotius, considered by many to be the father of the modern Law of Armed Conflict, noted that letters of marque and reprisal are endorsed by the entirety of the law of nations.³⁰ Historians credit the expansion and development of the Western world from 1600 to 1815 to privateers.³¹\nThe letter of marque originally served as a “self-help” authorization, allowing a private individual to seek reprisal against a foreigner who caused him harm.³² Over time, this developed into a government’s authorization to act on its behalf and seize property belonging to an enemy government, usually in the form of ships and cargo.³³ In its most fundamental form, a letter or marque authorized private merchant ships to carry arms in self-defense.³⁴\nUpon its founding, due to its small navy,³⁵ not only did the United States employ letters of marque, but it also was “the world’s biggest proponent of privateering.”³⁶ The Continental Congress issued many letters of marque,³⁷ as did individual states.³⁸ In fact, John Adams reportedly called an early letter of marque scheme, the Massachusetts Armed Vessels Act, “one of the most important documents of the Revolution.”³⁹\nThomas Jefferson was also an ardent proponent of privateering: “every possible encouragement should be given to privateering in time of war. . . . Our national ships are too few . . . to . . . retaliate the [sic] acts of the enemy. But by licensing private armed vessels, the whole naval force of the nation is truly brought to bear on the foe.”⁴⁰ Jefferson also realized that letters of marque served more than an offensive purpose, detailing how they are also a means of self-defense:\nThe ship Jane is an English merchant vessel . . . employed in the commerce between Jamaica and these States. She brought here a cargo of produce . . . and was to take away . . . flour. Knowing of the war when she left Jamaica, and that our coast was lined with small French privateers, she armed for her defense [sic], and took one of those commissions usually called letters of marque. She arrived here safely . . . Can it be necessary to say that a merchant vessel is not a privateer? That though she has arms to defend herself in time of war, in the course of her regular commerce, this no more makes her a privateer, than a husbandman following his plough in time of war, with a knife or pistol in his pocket, is thereby made a soldier. The occupation of a privateer is attack and plunder, that of a merchant\nAUGUST 2013 • THE ARMY LAWYER • DA PAM 27-50-483\nvessel is commerce and self-preservation.⁴¹\nSupport for letters of marque by the founding fathers was not merely philosophical consent. Thomas Paine and George Washington both owned stock in privateering ventures.⁴² Additionally, Benjamin Franklin practically ran his own privateering operation while he was assigned to France.⁴³ While most privateering ventures were for money, Franklin used the captured British ships, goods and men to trade for American prisoners of war.⁴⁴\nPrivateering in general weakened an enemy’s economy and its ability to wage war.⁴⁵ The American privateers devastated British commerce, funding the first two years of the war substantially through British captures.⁴⁶ By early 1777, the British had lost 250 ships, resulting in the collapse of several major London-based West India merchant companies.⁴⁷ Within a year, American privateers captured 559 British ships.⁴⁸ Of the approximately 796 British ships captured during the Revolutionary War, American privateers and armed merchant ships accounted for roughly 600.⁴⁹ British merchants, feeling the crippling effect of American privateers,⁵⁰ ensured that “every pressure was brought to bear on Parliament for [the Revolutionary War’s] discontinuance.”⁵¹ Even ships carrying linen from England to Ireland feared the American privateers, to the point of demanding warship escorts.⁵²\nAt the outset of the War of 1812, the British Navy consisted of 1,060 warships. In contrast, the United States Navy had only sixteen, including several that were unfit for sea.⁵³ As a consequence, the United States Navy was not considered to be a serious threat to British naval superiority.⁵⁴ In response, Congress passed a statute authorizing the use of privateers, but tightly controlled them.⁵⁵ The President could revoke, “at pleasure,” any letters of marque he issued after June 1812. The applicant had to list specific details about the ship, crew, and owners, and “Ample security” submitted to ensure compliance with both international and United States law. Further, and perhaps most relevant to modern application, the ship commanders were required to keep a detailed log of everything “that occurs, daily, and transmit them to the government,” and regular United States Navy commanders had to examine these logbooks when “meeting the privateer at sea.”⁵⁶ Failure to abide by these rules would mean forfeiture of the bond and “of all interest in any captures which they may make.”⁵⁷\nWith this new authorization in hand, American privateers wreaked havoc on British shipping and secured victory in America’s second war for independence.⁵⁸ In the process, privateers tallied $39 million in prizes, or roughly $672.5 million in 2012 dollars.⁵⁹\nFollowing the War of 1812, letters of marque did not disappear from the American landscape. President Andrew Jackson, in 1834, discussed the use of letters of marque against France.⁶⁰ Texas, upon declaring independence from Mexico, realized its coast was vulnerable due to a nascent navy. In response, the fledgling Texas legislature began to issue letters of marque with the intent to “protect the coast, harass Mexican shipping, and bring prizes that could be\n⁴¹ Richard, supra note 19, at 437 (citing Letter from Thomas Jefferson, to Gouverneur Morris (Aug. 16, 1793)), in 3 MEMOIR, CORRESPONDENCE AND MISCELLANIES FROM THE PAPERS OF THOMAS JEFFERSON 275 (1829).\n⁴² Tabarrok, supra note 21, at 567.\n⁴³ Id.; see generally WILLIAM BELL CLARK, BEN FRANKLIN’S PRIVATEERS (1956).\n⁴⁴ Tabarrok, supra note 21, at 567.\n⁴⁵ CARL E.

In all, Texas issued six letters of marque.⁶¹ Similarly, President Polk recognized the lawful ability of Mexico to issue letters of marque during the Mexican American War.⁶²\nIn 1856, Britain, France and other titular world powers met in Paris to discuss concerns arising from wartime maritime law.⁶³ France and Great Britain sought to end privateering as they could not effectively control the use of privateers by their enemies, i.e., the United States and Russia.⁶⁴ Great Britain, in particular, recognized privateering as an effective tool of weaker navies that posed a threat to its naval supremacy and sought to contain it.⁶⁵ The result of this meeting was the Paris Declaration of 1856, a document attempting to ban privateering.⁶⁶\nThe Paris Declaration contained three major provisions:⁶⁷ the first provided that “[p]rivateering is, and remains, abolished;” the second prevented the seizing of enemy goods on neutral ships; and the third prevented capture of neutral goods on enemy ships.⁶⁸ Most importantly, the Declaration went to great pains to ensure that its provisions did not apply to any nation save signatories.⁶⁹ This provision is important for two reasons.\nFirst, it made clear that it was not intended to be a universal ban on privateering, as it only applied to signatory nations at war with other signatories.⁷⁰ Second, as stated in the document, it did not have the power to police the actions of non-signatories.⁷¹\nThe United States recognized that this agreement was merely a means for England to maintain maritime supremacy at the expense of nations with a smaller seafaring force, and accordingly, demanded conditions prior to capitulation.⁷² The United States agreed to acquiesce and sign the document only if protection of all non-contraband private property from capture at sea was included.⁷³ The United States reasoned that since all private property is protected on land, “why should it not be [protected] also on the sea?”⁷⁴\nWhile the United States wanted to ensure it would be allowed to trade with both sides of a conflict, free from privateer entanglements, another more vital concern existed. According to Secretary of State William L. Marcy, “the United States could not forgo the right to send out privateers, which in the past had proved her most effective maritime weapon in time of war, and which, since she had no large navy, were essential to her fighting power.”⁷⁵ The United States realized that if privateering was banned, its nascent navy⁷⁶ would be no match for the greater naval might of countries such as Britain and France.⁷⁷ As the plenipotentiaries who signed the Declaration would not adequately address American concerns regarding private goods, and factoring in Marcy’s concern about the resulting unequal balance of naval power, the United States refused to sign the agreement.⁷⁸\nThe issue of privateering arose again in April 1861 when Confederate President Jefferson Davis, with Confederate Congressional approval,⁷⁹ issued letters of\n⁶¹ TEXAS PRIVATEERS, https://www.tsl.state.tx.us/exhibits/navy/privateers.html (last modified Aug. 30, 2011).\n⁶² Although President Polk did take issue with the blank letters of marque issued by Mexico, arguing those were illegal under international law and those acting in accordance with such letters are considered to be pirates.

Perhaps fearing the involvement of the British or French navies in the conflict, the Union declared that it would follow the Declaration and not issue letters of marque and Secretary of State Seward instructed American ambassadors to determine whether the signatories would be amicable to incorporating the proposed changes advocated by Marcy, thus allowing the United States to formally sign the Declaration.⁸¹ As an indication of the Union’s fear of privateers, Secretary Seward authorized acquiescence to the Declaration even if the requested exceptions were not approved.⁸² Britain and France declined the advances and the United States remained a non-signatory.⁸³\nConsequently, the Union passed a statutory authorization for President Lincoln to issue letters of marque⁸⁴ and declared that all attempts to disrupt, capture or destroy Union shipping would be treated as piracy and dealt with as such.⁸⁵ Regardless, the British entered the Civil War as privateers, sailing under letters of marque issued by the Confederacy. In fact, in a case brought by the United States against Britain for damages caused by a privateer, an international tribunal found no issue with a non-signatory (the Confederacy) issuing letters of marque to a signatory (Britain) “to construct, furnish, and crew ships to be used in commerce raids against a non-signatory, the United States.”⁸⁶\nWhen the United States entered into conflict with the Spanish during the Spanish American War, neither the United States nor Spain was a signatory to the Declaration of Paris.⁸⁷ Not only did Spain specifically reserve the right to issue letters of marque,⁸⁸ the Spanish government recognized\nAmerica’s right and ability to issue the same.⁸⁹ The Spanish never carried out the threat, and President McKinley, for the first time, articulated a U.S. intention to comply with the Paris Declaration, though still not be a signatory.⁹⁰\nDespite the reluctance, both Spain and the United States found ways to unofficially authorize privateers without formally issuing letters of marque.⁹¹ Both nations organized “auxiliary cruisers of the Navy.”⁹² The United States Navy chartered private merchant ships, heavily armed them, and subsequently entered into naval service.⁹³ The Navy used the ships and manned them with the owner’s regular, ostensibly civilian crew, placing the ships “under the entire control of the senior naval officer on board.”⁹⁴ One such ship, the City of Paris,⁹⁵ actually took prizes, with the United States Prize Court holding that she was not a “vessel of the Navy nor a privateer . . . ”⁹⁶ and finally ruling that she was an “armed vessel in the service of the United States” and the civilian crew was “entitled as of right to share in the prize money.”⁹⁷\nWhile the nature of privateering changed with the Spanish-American War, privateering did not disappear. At the 1907 Hague Peace Conference, the United States again voiced its opposition to the privateering prohibition.⁹⁸ Specifically, the United States voiced the same concerns as\n⁸⁰ ADAMS, supra note 72, at 141; JAMES D.

Applying Letters of Marque to Cyber Warfare\nLetters of marque were the original “self-help” governmental authorization.¹⁰⁴ While used to great effect in the past, they can now be resurrected and used to achieve similar results, especially in a cyber context. This section addresses the use of a cyber letter of marque in three areas: seizing assets; disrupting, disabling, and dismantling adversarial networks; and conducting cyber bounty hunting and rewards programs.\n## A. Seizing Assets\nIn a modern cyber letter of marque scheme, the U.S. government would authorize certain companies or individuals to track, freeze, and seize the illicit funds of designated criminal organizations. The net effect would be cutting off supplies to deliver the United States from its enemies.¹⁰⁵ For example, the United States has recently named several Russians as “transnational criminals” and promulgated an Executive Order that authorizes “seizure of their assets in the United States and prevents them from banking in dollars anywhere in the world.”¹⁰⁶\nWhen rogue states, such as Iran, contravene the will of the international community, the most used method of ensuring compliance is via the United Nations Security Council or unilateral economic sanctions.¹⁰⁷ The United States first instituted sanctions against Iran in 1979, following the seizure of the American Embassy during the Iranian Revolution. These sanctions included freezing roughly $11 billion in Iranian assets.¹⁰⁸ Iran continues to launder and hide money in contravention of these resolutions, often with the help of international banks.¹⁰⁹ In just one instance, the illicit transactions totaled $250 billion.¹¹⁰ Iran has also turned to China, specifically its banking system, for help in escaping economic sanctions.¹¹¹ Illicit money laundering in contravention of United Nations resolutions is not limited to Iran, but has also included North Korea, Cuba, Sudan, and Mexican criminal cartels.¹¹²\n⁹⁹ See supra Part II.\n¹⁰⁰ CHOATE, supra note 98, at 40.\n¹⁰¹ Id.\n¹⁰² Some have alleged that blimps operated on the west coast of the United States during World War II pursuant to letters of marque. “The Los Angeles based Resolute was the only airship . . . operated for the Navy under privateer status. . . .” JAMES SHOCK &amp; DAVID SMITH, THE GOODYEAR AIRSHIPS 43 (2002).

A cyber letter of marque would allow a privateer to seek these illicit funds wherever they may be hidden and either seize them or digitally sequester them for further law enforcement action. Such a cyber letter of marque brings to bear a formidable resource that will increase the likelihood for seizure of illicit funds and the shutdown of avenues for illicit funding.\nThe idea of using a letter of marque to effect an economic result is not novel. John Adams, in singing the virtues of privateering, said “[I]t is by cutting off supplies, not by attacks, sieges, or assaults, that I expect deliverance from enemies.”[119] While letters of marque during the\nRevolutionary War and the War of 1812 had distinct military objectives, they were \"also a means of commercial warfare conducted for profit.\"[120] Privateers \"were engaged not in patriotic, but business ventures.\"[121] Some privateers amassed great fortunes through their letter of marque commissions,[122] with even the common seaman receiving up to one thousand dollars above his regular wage from just one voyage.[123] The proceeds from captured enemy goods, once sold via the Unites States Prize Courts, were split between the privateer and the sovereign, thus providing a much needed injection of funds to the government and the privateer, while at the same time depriving the enemy of resources.[124]\nMotivated by the possibility of retaining a healthy percentage of the roughly $1.6 trillion presently illicitly laundered worldwide, the number of prospective cyber privateers would be legion. Consequently, the United States government would be in a position to demand an exorbitantly high bond, thus guaranteeing that only the most technically proficient and responsible cyber privateers would seek the commission. As for the cyber profiteer, the prospect of sharing a large percentage of the trillions of dollars, not to mention the potential for criminal or tort liability,[125] would ensure strict compliance with the terms of the letter of marque. As the privateer in the 1700s and 1800s provided both a much needed governmental funding stream[126] and served a valid national security function, so too would a modern cyber privateer by removing illicit funds from the hands of organized crime and sanction violators. The end result would be a potential death blow to crime organizations and rogue regimes.\nCurrently, the law restricts anyone from attempting to seize assets, whether they belong to the most deplorable rogue regime or the most vicious drug cartel. A cyber letter of marque would vest responsible and vetted entities with authority to digitally seize illicit funds while providing legal protections from criminal and/or civil liability. Current laws restricting attempted seizures would remain in place for those acting without a valid letter of marque or those\nAUGUST 2013 • THE ARMY LAWYER • DA PAM 27-50-483\noperating outside the scope of their letter of marque commissions.\n## B. Disrupting, Disabling, and Dismantling Adversarial Networks\nIn December 2012, a cybercriminal known as “vorVzakone”¹²⁷ announced Project Blitzkrieg, wherein he¹²⁸ planned to attack 30 Unites States banks in an attempt to steal money from accounts belonging to the “rich.”¹²⁹ McAfee Labs, a leading computer security company,¹³⁰ determined that this “is a credible threat to the financial industry and appears to be moving forward as planned.”¹³¹ The projected losses from the announced attack could reach “hundreds of millions of dollars.”¹³² The targets of the planned attack included Bank of America, Capitol One, Suntrust, Ameritrade, eTrade, and Fidelity and Schwab.¹³³ From April to December 2012, vorVzakone claimed at least 500 cyber victims.¹³⁴\nAt roughly the same time that the U.S. banking industry began to deal with vorVzakone, bank officials were contending with cyber attacks emanating from Iran.¹³⁵ The attack’s complexities are comparable to that of “a pack of fire-breathing Godzillas.”¹³⁶ In fact, the internet traffic used in the attacks has been “multiple times” the number that Russia allegedly directed or encouraged at Estonia in a month-long online assault in 2007 that nearly crippled the\n¹²⁷ Literally translated means “thief in law.” See KREBS ON SECURITY, New Findings Lend Credence to Project Blitzkrieg, http://krebsonsecurity.com/tag/vorvzakone-gozi-prinimalku/ (last visited Dec. 12, 2012).\n¹²⁸ While the exact identity of vorKzakone is unknown, he is believed to be a male, as shown by alleged photographs of vorKzakone online.

As discussed previously,¹⁵⁴ American privateers disrupted English commerce to such an extent that several London-based firms went bankrupt.¹⁵⁵ British merchants,\ntheir livelihoods so disrupted and, in fact, disabled, put pressure on their own government to end the war and allow the Americans to have their independence.¹⁵⁶ The financial toll on the enemy during the War of 1812 by American privateers was staggering, which in turn had the operative effect of weakening both British naval superiority and morale in England. If privateering proved to be such an effective defensive weapon in a naval context, it can certainly be used in a cyber context where disrupting an enemy’s attack can be done through a keyboard by a handful of individuals instead of through fourteen-gun warships manned by over a hundred crewmen.¹⁵⁷\n## C. Cyber Bounty Hunting\nThe realm of cyber letters of marque is not limited to offensive or defensive actions in the classic sense. A cyber letter of marque could also be utilized as a method of bounty hunting, providing information to law enforcement agencies necessary to apprehend a cyber attacker.\nBounty hunting, like a letter of marque, is an activity intertwined with the history of the United States. The United States Supreme Court endorsed bounty hunting as a legal activity in the 1872 case *Taylor v. Taintor*.¹⁵⁸ The federal government endorsed, and continues to endorse, bounty hunting for capture (as opposed to kill) as exemplified in the most wanted lists.¹⁵⁹ Perhaps most famously, the United\n¹⁴⁶ Bardin, *supra* note 13.\n¹⁴⁷ *Id.*; Jody Westby, *Caution: Active Response to Cyber Attacks Has High Risk*, FORBES.COM, Nov. 29, 2012, http://www.forbes.com/sites/jodywestby/2012/11/29/caution-active-response-to-cyber-attacks-has-high-risk/.\n¹⁴⁸ *N.

This, arguably, would be illegal under current United States law.¹⁷⁰\nThe Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) serves as a barrier to a corporation or individual¹⁷¹ from coming to the aid of a cyber-attack victim. Congress could carefully draft cyber letter of marquee legislation authorizing such entities to track and digitally “capture” a cyber criminal or terrorist. The only difference between the reward/bounty programs currently operated by the United States Government and a cyber letter of marque is the antiquated CFAA prohibition.\nIndeed, other scholars have posited the use of bounty hunting letters of marque.¹⁷² For example, Robert P. DeWitte, writing in the Indiana Law Journal, discussed one of the potential downfalls between physical, as opposed to virtual, bounty hunting through the use of a letter of marque. In particular, he illuminated the legitimate concern that “state authorities could conceivably attempt to capture and/or kill privateers” in their territory while operating under a valid U.S. letter of marque.¹⁷³ However, this concern in a cyber letter of marque context is not applicable since the cyber privateer/bounty hunter would be safely ensconced in the territorial United States, outside the physical reach of an unfriendly foreign armed force.\nJust as letters of marque are constitutional,¹⁷⁴ so too are bounties, as over a hundred years of U.S. jurisprudence demonstrates.¹⁷⁵ The issuance of a cyber letter of marque\n¹⁶⁹ See, e.g., NAT’L ASS’N FUGITIVE RECOVERY AGENTS (N.A.F.R.A.), http://fugitive-recovery.org/ (last visited Dec. 24, 2012); NAT’L ASS’N BAIL BOND INVESTIGATORS, http://nabbi.org/ (last visited Dec. 24, 2012).\n¹⁷⁰ The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1030 (2006), would most likely prevent a company or individual from taking these steps.

A cyber letter of marque would allow a cyber privateer access to those established and protected legal mechanisms.\n## IV. Legal Barriers\nDespite the many potential applications of a cyber letter of marque, some arguments raise concerns about the legality of its application. When discussing letters of marque, most commentators cite to the same alleged legal barriers to implementation: domestic law, usually the CFAA; the Law of Armed Conflict, specifically attribution and self-defense concerns; the Paris Declaration of 1856; and the Council of Europe Convention on Cyber-crime. This section examines each of these areas and analyzes why they are not legal barriers to the implementation of a cyber letter of marque regime.\n### A. The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act\nThe Computer Fraud and Abuse Act,¹⁷⁷ initially a criminal statute protecting government computers and those computers belonging to entities with compelling government interests,¹⁷⁸ forces companies under attack to “just stand and take a beating.”¹⁷⁹ Since its passage in 1984, it has expanded¹⁸⁰ to include civil liability by prohibiting anyone from “intentionally access[ing] a protected computer without authorization or exceed[ing] authorized access . . . [and recklessly causing damage¹⁸¹ involving a loss¹⁸² of] at least\n$5,000 in value.”¹⁸³ The definition of a “protected computer” has expanded to cover not only U.S. government computers, but also any computer “used in a manner that affects interstate or foreign commerce.”¹⁸⁴ Even those computers located outside the United States are protected.¹⁸⁵ Potentially, every single computer connected to the internet anywhere in the world would be a “protected computer” pursuant to the CFAA,¹⁸⁶ including, potentially, a blue-tooth-enabled garage door opener or coffeemaker in suburbia.¹⁸⁷\nWhile the CFAA prohibits the mere access to a protected computer, causing damage seems to be the lynchpin to triggering civil and criminal penalties under the CFAA. Some courts have homed in on the damage requirement, refusing to find civil or criminal liability. For example, in *Moulton v. VC3*,¹⁸⁸ the court held that an unauthorized port scan and throughput test of a defendant’s servers is not a violation of the CFAA¹⁸⁹ since no “damage” was caused. Likewise, in *United States v. Czubinski*,¹⁹⁰ the court reversed the criminal conviction of an IRS agent who accessed a “protected computer” to satisfy his curiosity.¹⁹¹\nWhile some of the judicial decisions seem to allow some degree of cyber intelligence collection under the current regulatory scheme,¹⁹² the courts clearly would not allow an entity to seize assets, whether they are being laundered at a major international bank or if information leading to their location is on a drug kingpin’s desktop\n¹⁷⁶ 31 U.S.C. §§ 3729–3733 (2006).\n¹⁷⁷ 18 U.S.C. § 1030 (2006).\n¹⁷⁸ This included not only government computers and networks, but also those of large banks, the New York Stock Exchange, etc. Robert B.

Consequently, government authorization would first be a necessity.¹⁹³\nDespite allowing for criminal and civil penalties, the CFAA is not an effective means of preventing cyber attacks.¹⁹⁴ Some have argued that active-defense authorizations, such as a letter of marque, are not necessary as the cyber victim can turn over evidence of a cyber attack to the FBI for prosecution.¹⁹⁵ While this might work in theory, in actual practice it leaves the cyber victim virtually remediless for a host of reasons. For one, law enforcement personnel are questionably competent when it comes to cyber attacks and cyber crime.¹⁹⁶ Further, due to the global nature of cyber attacks, an American court might have a difficult time bringing a cyber attacker within its jurisdiction.¹⁹⁷ Even if a cyber attack victim captures all the information necessary to conduct a thorough law enforcement investigation, the FBI has bungled such gift-wrapped cyber cases in the past.¹⁹⁸\nJust as cyber criminals are capable of seizing money from an individual’s bank accounts,¹⁹⁹ cyber companies with the technical expertise can track down and seize illicit funds, given the proper governmental authorization. A cyber letter of marque would provide such authorization.\n## B. Attribution and Self-Defense\nAttribution is the legal requirement to positively identify the attacker prior to responding with force in self-defense.²⁰⁰ How does a prospective cyber privateer ensure it is striking the proper target²⁰¹ and how does a cyber-privateer cover their tracks so as to not entice further attacks? Admittedly, discovering the source of a cyber attack is “the most important aspect of active defense.”²⁰² It necessarily must be a requirement when issuing a cyber letter of marque to ensure that the privateer is targeting the proper bad actor. Critics have complained that it is too difficult to identify the attacker with sufficient accuracy to ensure a counter-attack is accurately aimed.²⁰³ While tracing an attack may not provide actionable results, and some technologies “limit the ability to make perfect surgical strikes with active defense,”²⁰⁴ the problem may not be as big as it appears. Some speculate that it is more difficult for the bad actor to identify the cyber privateer than it is for the cyber privateer to identify the bad actor.²⁰⁵\nThe attribution concerns may, however, be a bit overblown.²⁰⁶ Even the Russian cyber attacks launched or encouraged against Estonia could be traced back to the “Russian intelligence apparatus.”²⁰⁷ In fact, “attribution to at least some level will almost always be possible.”²⁰⁸ While the exact technologies available to ensure accurate attribution, which can be done in seconds, are not the focus of this paper, such technology is not new and “is currently the subject of a significant amount of research aimed at improving accuracy and efficiency.”²⁰⁹ While it may not be feasible, or even possible, to accurately attribute 100 million cyber attacks,²¹⁰ “it is clear that the current state of the\n¹⁹³ See, e.g., NRC REPORT, supra note 18 (discussing the exemption for lawfully authorized law enforcement and intelligence agencies activities to the CFAA and how government agencies may commandeer private computes or pay for their usage).\n¹⁹⁴ See supra Part I (discussing of the frequency of cyber attacks). The CFAA, in one form or another, has been in effect since 1984. It has had little to no affect on cyber attacks.\n¹⁹⁵ See, e.g., Westby, supra note 147.\n¹⁹⁶ Ms. Westby, while arguing a cyber victim should turn over information to law enforcement instead of proactively defending themselves, admits that “there are too few of them with skills adequate to match the sophisticated nature of today’s cyber criminals.” Id. Others have agreed with her assessment that there are too few cyber-competent law enforcement officers.

Paris Declaration of 1856\nMost critics of the letter of marque, regardless of its application, usually point to the Paris Declaration of 1856, noting that the United States is prohibited from employing privateers due to the agreement.²¹² This argument, however, is without merit.\nFirst, the Declaration does not apply to the United States per the plain language of the treaty. “The present Declaration is not and shall not be binding, except between those Powers who have acceded, or shall accede, to it.”²¹³ The United States did not accede to it in 1856 and has not, in the ensuing 157 years, acceded to it. Under the rules of treaty interpretation,²¹⁴ a treaty is binding only upon parties to it,²¹⁵ and it “does not create either obligations or rights for a third State without its consent.”²¹⁶ Further, in order to impose an obligation on a third State, it must “expressly accept that obligation in writing.”²¹⁷ To date, the United States has not consented to the obligations of the Declaration in writing, as required by the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.\nAdditionally, the Declaration clearly pertains, and limits itself, to maritime law.²¹⁸ Since a cyber letter of marque regime is not grounded in maritime law and letters of marque are specifically authorized in the United States Constitution, it is permissible under international law, Paris Declaration notwithstanding, to issue cyber letters of marque.\nOthers argue²¹⁹ that the Declaration has become customary international law.²²⁰ While this might be true at first blush, it ignores the legal and historical fact. A nation, not otherwise bound by a treaty, does not become bound by operation of the rule of customary international law if it has been a persistent objector. In order to be considered a persistent objector, and therefore not bound by a treaty, the State “must have objected to the emergence of a new norm during its formation and continue to object afterwards.”²²¹ Even if it has been state practice to follow the precepts in a treaty, non-signatory states can alter their actions in order to confront new threats.²²²\nRegarding the Declaration of Paris, the United States objected during the formation of the proposed privateering ban²²³ and objected to the Declaration by passing legislation authorizing privateers during the Civil War;²²⁴ the Spanish government recognized America’s right to issue letters of marque during the Spanish-American War,²²⁵ and voiced opposition at the 1907 Hague Peace Conference.²²⁶ Clearly, the United States has been a persistent objector to the Declaration and thus not bound by it. Simply stated, American privateering declined not because of acquiescence to international treaties which it did not, and had no intent to, sign. Rather, privateering declined because America, after 1898, no longer had a nascent navy, had become a major\nAUGUST 2013 • THE ARMY LAWYER • DA PAM 27-50-483\nnaval power,²²⁷ and the “cost-saving advantages of privateering [had] declined.”²²⁸\nAssuming, *arguendo*, that the Paris Declaration is customary international law that the United States must follow, the issuance of cyber letters of marque is still not banned. The Declaration never defines privateers.²²⁹ As history demonstrates, a contracted civilian ship can be armed, staffed with civilians, fight, and take prizes—all without violating the Declaration.²³⁰\n## D. The Council of Europe Convention on Cyber-Crime²³¹\nOn 23 November 2001, the United States signed on to the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime.²³² The Cybercrime Convention came into effect in the United States on 1 January 2007.²³³ The Cybercrime Convention’s main objective “is to pursue a common criminal policy aimed at the protection of society against cyber-crime, especially by adopting appropriate legislation and fostering international co-operation.”²³⁴ It purports to allow countries to work together through substantive, procedural, and jurisdictional laws against a cyber criminal committing crimes in one country while physically located in another.²³⁵ Prior to the Cybercrime Convention (and some would argue even today),²³⁶ the cyber police forces in the United States or internationally did not have the tools or authority necessary to combat cyber-attacks. Additionally, it did not address the\ncultural issues that may arise from crimes committed in cyberspace.²³⁷ To make matters worse, some countries did not have adequate laws against cyber-crime.²³⁸\nAn attempt to correct these law enforcement deficiencies was the impetus for the creation of the Cybercrime Convention. It remains the only international treaty attempting to deal with the issue of transcontinental cyber attacks.²³⁹ It fails, however, to effectively protect anyone from cyber attacks. It is largely a symbolic document, serving mainly to reassure the public that governments are doing *something* to address the threat.²⁴⁰ Those reassurances are hollow, as only roughly half of the ratifying states have passed domestic legislation required to enforce the document.²⁴¹\nRemarkably, the exceptions contained in the Cybercrime Convention negate its impact. First, no requirement exists that any cyber attacker actually be prosecuted; instead, the State must merely “report the final outcome to the requesting Party [i.e., the cyber victim’s nation] in due course.”²⁴² In addition, nearly every enforcement provision of the Cybercrime Convention contains a legislative flaw, allowing a nation state to refuse to cooperate.²⁴³ A nation may refuse a request for assistance during or after a cyber attack emanating from its country for a host of reasons. These reasons include, but are not limited to²⁴⁴: if a request for assistance would violate domestic laws,²⁴⁵ if a request for assistance and information gained\nAUGUST 2013 • THE ARMY LAWYER • DA PAM 27-50-483\ntherefrom could be used in any investigation or court proceedings other than those listed in the request,²⁴⁶ or if an attacked nation believes there are political issues at play.²⁴⁷\nPerhaps as a sign of the naïve belief that the feckless Cybercrime Convention will actually curb cyber attacks, the Council of Europe’s Committee of Experts on Terrorism opined in February 2010 that no further conventions are needed to address cyber terrorism because “large scale attacks on computer systems appeared to be already covered by the Cybercrime Convention.”²⁴⁸ Yet two days later, on 18 February 2010, The Washington Post broke the story that more than 75,000 computers and roughly 2,500 companies in the United States, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Turkey, and Mexico were victims of “one of the largest and most sophisticated attacks by cyber criminals discovered to date.”²⁴⁹ The attack began in 2008 and was not discovered until January 2010.²⁵⁰\nIn the United States, an unnamed Department of Justice official purportedly alleged that the “impact of the convention [is] ‘very positive,’” which, again, seems to ignore the reality of cyber attack’s scope.²⁵¹ To the contrary, the Cybercrime Convention seems to merely limit the ability of a law-abiding entity to take proactive steps necessary to cease a cyber threat.²⁵²\nBecause the Cybercrime Convention does not diminish cyber attacks, lacks any enforcement or prosecution mechanism and expressly states that signatory states pass domestic criminal laws covering “illegal access,”²⁵³ “illegal interception,”²⁵⁴ criminal “misuse of devices,”²⁵⁵ [emphasis added], the United States is not prevented from issuing letters of marque. If Congress exercised its constitutionally authorized power to issue letters of marque, limited to cyber operations, no violation of any provision of the Convention would occur because no domestic criminal acts occur.\nEven the U.S. Attorney General stated, in 2006, that the Cybercrime Convention “is in full accord with all U.S. Constitutional protections.”²⁵⁶ The activity undertaken pursuant to a constitutionally authorized and congressionally endorsed cyber letter of marque would not, under United States law, be illegal and thus not a violation of any provision contained in the Cybercrime Convention. In short, a cyber letter of marque issued by Congress would not violate the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime.\n## V. Authorizations and Oversight\nWhile a cyber letter of marque is legal, both under domestic and international law, any cyber letter of marque regime must provide for a method of authorizing and subsequently supervising a cyber privateer. This section discusses some potential methods of authorization and oversight necessary for an effective cyber letter of marque regime.\n## A. Issuance of Bonds and Authorizations\nPrior to the issuance of a letter of marque, all prospective cyber privateers should be required to register with a central governmental database. This database would provide the supervising agency²⁵⁷ with a means of not only policing cyber privateers and holding them accountable, but also a means for parties allegedly aggrieved by United States authorized cyber privateers to seek redress. Such a database and registration would also allow the supervisory agency an opportunity to vet the putative cyber privateer. “If a company does not have the skills to defend its systems, it likely does not have the skills to attack back—or make\nAUGUST 2013 • THE ARMY LAWYER • DA PAM 27-50-483\n246 This provision, in effect, means that if the information leads to more criminals, and a nation wants to prosecute them, it may not use this information in that investigation/prosecution. The nation must start over in the investigative process as it relates to the newly discovered bad actors. *Id.* art. 28.\n247 *Id.* art. 27.\n248 VATIS, *supra* note 242, at 219 (quoting Council of Europe Committee of Experts on Terrorism (CODEXTER), Opinion of the Committee of Experts on Terrorism (CODEXTER) for the Attention of the Committee of Ministers on Cyber terrorism and Use of Internet for Terrorist Purposes).\n249 Ellen Nakashima, *More Than 75,000 Computer Systems Hacked in One of Largest Cyber Attacks, Security Firm Says*, WASH POST, Feb. 18, 2010, http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/02/17/AR2010021705816.html.\n250 *Id.*\n251 VATIS, *supra* note 242, at 209 (quoting an unnamed U.S. Dep’t of Justice official).\n252 As Bardin states:\nDo we really think that establishing a convention on cyber crime is going to stop our adversaries? They do not recognize our virtual boards or virtual sovereignty as it is. Why would they recognize a convention on cyber crime? All this does is force offensive cyber forces to establish an unwieldy ‘rules of engagement’ that ties the hands of those who can execute offensive cyber actions.\nBardin, *supra* note 13.\n253 *Id.* ch.

The prime importance of competent exercise of the powers enumerated in the letter of marque is underscored when the vast amount of money and intellectual property lost on a frequent and recurring basis, coupled with the exacting nature of establishing positive identification, especially attribution, is contemplated. A large monetary bond would, in effect, keep the cyber cutthroats out of this business.\nSingapore established CaseTrust, a similar system, in order to protect consumers engaged in e-commerce. CaseTrust receives complaints against e-vendors and legitimizes member companies. Prior to joining, a\nprospective e-vendor must give a banker’s guarantee, or a bond, to establish that it is indeed a legitimate and reputable company. The CaseTrust system provides for compulsory adjudication including the power to not only fine a vendor, but also to revoke its certification. As a result, the consumer is protected by providing a source of bonded companies and a policing mechanism. Additionally, the commercial entities are shrouded with governmental legitimacy. To date, enforcement has been effective and participation is growing.²⁶⁵\nIn a historical context, the putative privateer kept detailed daily logs, which were available for inspection by any U.S. naval commander he might encounter.²⁶⁶ Similar requirements would be made of cyber privateers. As all internet activity can be, or actually is, easily monitored,²⁶⁷ this requirement does not place too onerous a burden on the purported cyber privateer. While most private companies are loathe to share details of their cyber activity for fear of losing intellectual property, a competitive edge, or disclose their cyber defenses or weaknesses,²⁶⁸ a company serious about executing a defensive or even offensive cyber letter of marque should be willing to accept the more stringent scrutiny, such as reviewing cyber logbooks.\nA cyber letter of marque would designate the bearers to be licensed combatants for the sovereign, authorizing them to “bear arms” in the cyber sense of the word, and either defend against specific attacks and launch counter attacks (back-backs) or engage in offensive cyber operations directed at sovereign selected targets or networks.²⁶⁹ A private company could be granted authorization to conduct a hack-back, temporarily incapacitating a cyber bad actor, and then notify the appropriate law enforcement or national security entity for final apprehension or network termination.²⁷⁰\nAUGUST 2013 • THE ARMY LAWYER • DA PAM 27-50-483\nIn recognition that cyber privateers would, to a certain extent, be bearing arms, a workable set of rules of engagement would necessarily be a major part of the actual commission. Professor Susan Brenner has expressed concerns that cyber privateers could be motivated to vigilantism and exceed the bounds of their charter, exhibiting an inability to determine who is a just target.²⁷¹ These concerns can be easily alleviated by carefully drafted rules of engagement and scope of authorization in the letter of marque commission itself. If cyber privateers exceed the scope of the commission, they lose their substantial bond, face debarment from future government contracts, and open themselves up to potential criminal prosecutions since their actions were outside the scope of the immunity granted by the letter of marque. These adverse ramifications should keep a vetted and approved cyber privateer in line.\n## B. Legal and Judicial Oversight\nThe legal framework for a workable letter of marque regime already exists under current federal law.²⁷² “Privateering worked only because it was backed by a substantial system of law, not only the common law of property, but also the statutory creations such as admiralty courts and bond requirements.”²⁷³ The federal judiciary is vested with original jurisdiction to determine prizes,²⁷⁴ burdens of proof established,²⁷⁵ the due process rights of both the captor and the captive duly considered,²⁷⁶ and the\nsecuritylaw.us/2012/11/30/steven-chabinsky-crowdstrike-ex-fbi-cyber-division-talks-pprivate-sector-cyberdeterrence-at-abas-natsec-law-conference/.\n²⁷¹ Brenner, supra note 212.\n²⁷² See, e.g., Commissioning Private Vessels for Seizure of Piratical Vessels, 33 U.S.C. § 386 (2006).\nThe President is authorized to instruct the commanders of the public armed vessels of the United States, and to authorize the commanders of any other armed vessels sailing under the authority of any letters of marquee and reprisal granted by Congress, or the commanders of any other suitable vessels, to subdue, seize, take, and, if on the high seas, to send into any port of the United States, any vessel or boat built, purchased, fitted out, or held as mentions in 33 U.S.C. § 385.\nId.\n²⁷³ Tabarrok, supra note 21, at 572.\n²⁷⁴ Jurisdiction, 10 U.S.C. § 7652 (2006).\n²⁷⁵ See The Resolution, 2 U.S. 19 (U.S. 1781) (holding that the burden of proving a prize was captured lawfully lies with the captors).\n²⁷⁶ The legality of a capture is not determined until a court of competent jurisdiction has issued an order making such a determination. Id. Whether property seized may be confiscated as a prize is a judicial question and each case is to be decided on its own facts. Property Captured by the Potomac Flotilla, 10 Op. Att’y Gen. 467 (1863).\ninterests of the United States represented by a duly appointed authority in the “United States attorney for the district in which the prize cause is adjudicated.”²⁷⁷ In fact, Chapter 655 of 10 U.S.C. contains the entire statutory framework to judicially administer a letter of marque regime.\nHistorical precedence demonstrates that judicial oversight is an effective means to monitor and police privateers. For example, the court invalidated the first two prizes claimed during the War of 1812 because of improperly issued letters of marque.²⁷⁸ Even the venerable USS Constitution was also involved in an illegitimate capture, a situation embarrassingly rectified by the courts.²⁷⁹ Indeed, a rich legal history of privateering cases exists before the United States Supreme Court.²⁸⁰\nSome are concerned that the government would not be able to control the behavior of modern privateers, especially in a cyber context.²⁸¹ In reality, these concerns are easily addressed with stiff consequences.²⁸² Penalties can include forfeiture of the bond and any pay due as a result of a successful capture or mission, seizure of assets,²⁸³ debarment from all future government contracts,²⁸⁴ exclusion from future letter of marque commissions, criminal prosecution, and potential tort liability.²⁸⁵\nAt least two presidents proposed criminal prosecution for misuse of a letter of marque. President Jefferson, a major proponent of privateering during the Revolutionary War,²⁸⁶ declared that individuals operating off the coast without valid commissions be captured and tried as pirates.²⁸⁷\n²⁷⁷ Duties of United States Attorney, 10 U.S.C.A. § 7656 (2012).\n²⁷⁸ Tabarrok, supra note 21, at 568.\n²⁷⁹ The United States paid the owners of the captured ship $11,000 in damages.

Tort liability has real teeth, as government is generally immune from civil suit, whereas a letter of marque holder would not be. See David A. Sklansky, The Private Police, 46 UCLA L. REV. 1165, 1186 (1999); Richard, supra note 19, at 455.\n²⁸⁶ See supra Part II.\n²⁸⁷ UPTON, supra note 57, at 180.\nAUGUST 2013 • THE ARMY LAWYER • DA PAM 27-50-483\nPresident Lincoln made a similar proclamation regarding privateers hired by the Confederate States, as he did not believe the “rebellious” states had legal authority to issue letters of marque.²⁸⁸\nAccording to some scholars, one of the major drawbacks of the traditional letter of marque system was the lack of organization or unified command, control and communication.²⁸⁹ To address this concern, all cyber letter of marque holders would report their activities and progress to a central authority on a regular and recurring basis.²⁹⁰ This central authority would have the ability to terminate the cyber privateer’s commission and/or refer the matter to the Department of Justice for criminal prosecution, should the commissioner act outside the bounds of authority. As this central authority would have an over-arching view of which cyber privateers were acting in which arenas, they could deconflict any possible issues of interrupting law enforcement, intelligence, or national security operations in cyber space. Additionally, purely governmental agencies, such as the National Security Agency, would then be in a better position to work in concert with the cyber privateers to execute specific targeted operations.²⁹¹\n## VI.

The United States must develop stronger defenses before this occurs.”²⁹² Despite this threat, the U.S. government seems to be content with merely allowing network owners to “[sit] there . . . trying to swat away these intrusions.”²⁹³ Industry experts have specifically asked that Congress “provide opportunities and responsibilities to the private sector to hack back.”²⁹⁴\nPerhaps in tacit acknowledgement that the private sector is better prepared to handle cyber issues, the United States Air Force solicits private industry for capabilities designed to “destroy, deny, degrade, disrupt, deceive, corrupt, or usurp the adversaries [sic] ability to use the cyberspace domain for his advantage.”²⁹⁵\nAdditionally, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DAPRA), through its “Plan X,” sought “innovative research proposals” in an effort to “dominate the cyber battle space.”²⁹⁶ Congress has not only denied these requests, while at the same time ignoring the Air Force and DARPA’s proposed use of private industry, but at the same time tied their hands with respect to possible civil and criminal liability.²⁹⁷ Members of Congress have instead suggested legislative mandates requiring “owners and operators of vital infrastructure [to] better protect networks,” or even tax credits as a means of encouraging corporations to establish stricter cyber security safeguards.²⁹⁸ Congress has failed to provide industry with the tools they are desperately asking for: a means in which to protect themselves in a meaningful way.\nPolitical policy makers must understand that “[i]n cyberspace, the offense has the upper hand” and the nation cannot remain secure while hiding behind a mythical all protective firewall.²⁹⁹ Accordingly, Congress should exercise its constitutional authority and authorize the\n22\nAUGUST 2013 • THE ARMY LAWYER • DA PAM 27-50-483\nissuance of cyber letters of marque and allow American entities to actively defend themselves in cyber space.\nAs delineated above, the letter of marque has a rich tradition, not only in international and maritime law, but also in American history.

Kessinger*\n## I. Introduction\nAt any given time, millions upon millions of people connect to each other via cyberspace. While a convenient method for grandparents to view pictures of their grandchildren, the Internet is also an exceedingly effective vehicle by which to attack a state, a company, or an individual. These attacks occur with frightening frequency, over 1,000 per hour in Great Britain alone; and Britain recognizes the severity of the cyber threat. In the first four days of the November 2012 fighting between Israel and Gaza militants, over 44 million attacks on Israeli websites and an estimated 100 million total attacks occurred. Cyber-attacks cost Australia “an average of $2 million per incident” and exceed a billion dollars per year. Successful attacks also occur against international bodies, such as the International Atomic Energy Agency. These cyber attacks seek not only military targets, but also industrial espionage.\nDespite the frequency and increasing severity of cyber attacks, many governments and industries around the world, to include the United States, are either seemingly helpless against the cyber onslaught, too dysfunctional to create a useful offensive or defensive cyber scheme, or are “highly immature with limited vision and strategic foresight.” Some foreign jurisdictions, our allies in the fight against cyber-attacks, fail to stem the tide of these attacks and now punish the cyber victims.\nThis article explores the improbable, if not politically impossible, application of the letter of marque concept to the cyber arena. Despite the likely political stigma such a proposition would have in today’s Congress, letters of marque are nevertheless a constitutional and valid tool to execute cyber operations, and thus worthy of discussion.\nProposed defenses to cyber attacks are becoming increasingly complex and bizarre.

Militarily, the government retains control over the letter of marque holder (a \"privateer\") and responsibilities as delineated within the express terms of the letter of marque while at the same time broadening the military's reach.$^{19}$ As a law enforcement tool, a letter of marque deputizes an individual or company, thus vesting that entity with police powers. This authority allows the privateer to detain targets, bring them before the sovereign, and receive compensation based on successes, much like a bounty hunter.$^{20}$ Using civilian forces in a military/national defense context is not a concept limited to antiquity. For example, monitored non-governmental civilian participation in governmental operations exists with private military contractors. The United States spent over $300 billion on military contractors from 2001–2007.$^{21}$\nThere is an apparent aversion to the use of letter of marque and privateers.$^{22}$ Various bills introduced throughout\nthe years proposing the revival of letter of marque have stalled or failed outright.$^{23}$ Despite the hesitation, letters of marque and privateers served a legitimate military purpose,$^{24}$ both in supplementing regular combat forces and crippling enemy commerce while protecting American commerce.$^{25}$ A cyber letter of marque would enable a privateer to seize digital assets, disrupt fiscal and communication networks, destroy attacking networks,$^{26}$ and act as a cyber bounty hunter.\nApplying a letter of marque scheme to the cyber world would not only provide authority for American companies to defend themselves from cyber threats, but also allow them to take proactive measures to neutralize a cyber threat before it coalesces into danger. In addition to providing requisite authorization, a letter of marque scheme would regulate the conduct of a prospective cyber privateer and ensure accountability to effect compliance with the letter of marque's mandate.\nPart II of this article examines the historical usage of letters of marque and privateers. A brief historical discussion shows the use of letters of marque in national defense. Such historical perspective provides a useful background when considering their application to cyberspace. Part III applies legal and historical principles to a modern letter of marque regime. In particular, the application of letters of marque within the context of existing technologies and proposed authorization and oversight safeguards are examined. The various laws implicated in a modern cyber letter of marque regime are reviewed in Part IV. Finally, Part V addresses the authorizations and oversight necessary to effectively manage a successful, and lawful, cyber letter of marque regime. While not meant to be an exhaustive analysis of all possible facets related to the implementation of a cyber letter of marque regime, this article shows that despite some initial political and legal issues, using a cyber letter of marque can effectively mitigate the threats posed by cyber attacks.\n## II. History of Letter of Marque and Privateering\nThe concept of allowing private individuals to wage war on a foreign sovereign is not new, nor is it unique to United\nAUGUST 2013 • THE ARMY LAWYER • DA PAM 27-50-483\nStates history. The letter of marque and privateering concepts have been a part of both international law and the accepted norms of warfare for centuries, despite the Declaration of Paris—which purportedly banned privateering. Hugo Grotius, considered by many to be the father of the modern Law of Armed Conflict, noted that letters of marque and reprisal are endorsed by the entirety of the law of nations. Historians credit the expansion and development of the Western world from 1600 to 1815 to privateers.\nThe letter of marque originally served as a “self-help” authorization, allowing a private individual to seek reprisal against a foreigner who caused him harm. Over time, this developed into a government’s authorization to act on its behalf and seize property belonging to an enemy government, usually in the form of ships and cargo. In its most fundamental form, a letter or marque authorized private merchant ships to carry arms in self-defense.\nUpon its founding, due to its small navy, not only did the United States employ letters of marque, but it also was “the world’s biggest proponent of privateering.” The Continental Congress issued many letters of marque, as did individual states. In fact, John Adams reportedly called an early letter of marque scheme, the Massachusetts Armed Vessels Act, “one of the most important documents of the Revolution.”\nThomas Jefferson was also an ardent proponent of privateering: “every possible encouragement should be given to privateering in time of war. . . . Our national ships are too few . . . to . . . retaliate the [sic] acts of the enemy. But by licensing private armed vessels, the whole naval force of the nation is truly brought to bear on the foe.” Jefferson also realized that letters of marque served more than an offensive purpose, detailing how they are also a means of self-defense:\nThe ship Jane is an English merchant vessel . . . employed in the commerce between Jamaica and these States. She brought here a cargo of produce . . . and was to take away . . . flour. Knowing of the war when she left Jamaica, and that our coast was lined with small French privateers, she armed for her defense [sic], and took one of those commissions usually called letters of marque. She arrived here safely . . . Can it be necessary to say that a merchant vessel is not a privateer? That though she has arms to defend herself in time of war, in the course of her regular commerce, this no more makes her a privateer, than a husbandman following his plough in time of war, with a knife or pistol in his pocket, is thereby made a soldier. The occupation of a privateer is attack and plunder, that of a merchant\nAUGUST 2013 • THE ARMY LAWYER • DA PAM 27-50-483\nvessel is commerce and self-preservation.\nSupport for letters of marque by the founding fathers was not merely philosophical consent. Thomas Paine and George Washington both owned stock in privateering ventures. Additionally, Benjamin Franklin practically ran his own privateering operation while he was assigned to France. While most privateering ventures were for money, Franklin used the captured British ships, goods and men to trade for American prisoners of war.\nPrivateering in general weakened an enemy’s economy and its ability to wage war. The American privateers devastated British commerce, funding the first two years of the war substantially through British captures. By early 1777, the British had lost 250 ships, resulting in the collapse of several major London-based West India merchant companies. Within a year, American privateers captured 559 British ships. Of the approximately 796 British ships captured during the Revolutionary War, American privateers and armed merchant ships accounted for roughly 600. British merchants, feeling the crippling effect of American privateers, ensured that “every pressure was brought to bear on Parliament for [the Revolutionary War’s] discontinuance.” Even ships carrying linen from England to Ireland feared the American privateers, to the point of demanding warship escorts.\nAt the outset of the War of 1812, the British Navy consisted of 1,060 warships. In contrast, the United States Navy had only sixteen, including several that were unfit for sea. As a consequence, the United States Navy was not considered to be a serious threat to British naval superiority. In response, Congress passed a statute authorizing the use of privateers, but tightly controlled them. The President could revoke, “at pleasure,” any letters of marque he issued after June 1812. The applicant had to list specific details about the ship, crew, and owners, and “Ample security” submitted to ensure compliance with both international and United States law. Further, and perhaps most relevant to modern application, the ship commanders were required to keep a detailed log of everything “that occurs, daily, and transmit them to the government,” and regular United States Navy commanders had to examine these logbooks when “meeting the privateer at sea.” Failure to abide by these rules would mean forfeiture of the bond and “of all interest in any captures which they may make.”\nWith this new authorization in hand, American privateers wreaked havoc on British shipping and secured victory in America’s second war for independence. In the process, privateers tallied $39 million in prizes, or roughly $672.5 million in 2012 dollars.\nFollowing the War of 1812, letters of marque did not disappear from the American landscape. President Andrew Jackson, in 1834, discussed the use of letters of marque against France. Texas, upon declaring independence from Mexico, realized its coast was vulnerable due to a nascent navy. In response, the fledgling Texas legislature began to issue letters of marque with the intent to “protect the coast, harass Mexican shipping, and bring prizes that could be\n Richard, supra note 19, at 437 (citing Letter from Thomas Jefferson, to Gouverneur Morris (Aug. 16, 1793)), in 3 MEMOIR, CORRESPONDENCE AND MISCELLANIES FROM THE PAPERS OF THOMAS JEFFERSON 275 (1829).\n Tabarrok, supra note 21, at 567.\n Id.; see generally WILLIAM BELL CLARK, BEN FRANKLIN’S PRIVATEERS (1956).\n Tabarrok, supra note 21, at 567.\n CARL E.

In all, Texas issued six letters of marque. Similarly, President Polk recognized the lawful ability of Mexico to issue letters of marque during the Mexican American War.\nIn 1856, Britain, France and other titular world powers met in Paris to discuss concerns arising from wartime maritime law. France and Great Britain sought to end privateering as they could not effectively control the use of privateers by their enemies, i.e., the United States and Russia. Great Britain, in particular, recognized privateering as an effective tool of weaker navies that posed a threat to its naval supremacy and sought to contain it. The result of this meeting was the Paris Declaration of 1856, a document attempting to ban privateering.\nThe Paris Declaration contained three major provisions: the first provided that “[p]rivateering is, and remains, abolished;” the second prevented the seizing of enemy goods on neutral ships; and the third prevented capture of neutral goods on enemy ships. Most importantly, the Declaration went to great pains to ensure that its provisions did not apply to any nation save signatories. This provision is important for two reasons.\nFirst, it made clear that it was not intended to be a universal ban on privateering, as it only applied to signatory nations at war with other signatories. Second, as stated in the document, it did not have the power to police the actions of non-signatories.\nThe United States recognized that this agreement was merely a means for England to maintain maritime supremacy at the expense of nations with a smaller seafaring force, and accordingly, demanded conditions prior to capitulation. The United States agreed to acquiesce and sign the document only if protection of all non-contraband private property from capture at sea was included. The United States reasoned that since all private property is protected on land, “why should it not be [protected] also on the sea?”\nWhile the United States wanted to ensure it would be allowed to trade with both sides of a conflict, free from privateer entanglements, another more vital concern existed. According to Secretary of State William L. Marcy, “the United States could not forgo the right to send out privateers, which in the past had proved her most effective maritime weapon in time of war, and which, since she had no large navy, were essential to her fighting power.” The United States realized that if privateering was banned, its nascent navy would be no match for the greater naval might of countries such as Britain and France. As the plenipotentiaries who signed the Declaration would not adequately address American concerns regarding private goods, and factoring in Marcy’s concern about the resulting unequal balance of naval power, the United States refused to sign the agreement.\nThe issue of privateering arose again in April 1861 when Confederate President Jefferson Davis, with Confederate Congressional approval, issued letters of\n TEXAS PRIVATEERS, https://www.tsl.state.tx.us/exhibits/navy/privateers.html (last modified Aug. 30, 2011).\n Although President Polk did take issue with the blank letters of marque issued by Mexico, arguing those were illegal under international law and those acting in accordance with such letters are considered to be pirates.

The Maritime population of the United States, their enterprising marine, might furnish to Russia the elements of a fleet of privateers, which attached to its service by Letters of Marque and covering the seas with a network would harass and pursue our commerce even in the most remote waters.\nTRAVERS TWISS, BELLIGERENT RIGHT ON THE HIGH SEAS, SINCE THE DECLARATION OF PARIS 10 (1856) (1884).\n Richard, supra note 19, at 428.\n “Privateering is, and remains, abolished. . . .

Perhaps fearing the involvement of the British or French navies in the conflict, the Union declared that it would follow the Declaration and not issue letters of marque and Secretary of State Seward instructed American ambassadors to determine whether the signatories would be amicable to incorporating the proposed changes advocated by Marcy, thus allowing the United States to formally sign the Declaration. As an indication of the Union’s fear of privateers, Secretary Seward authorized acquiescence to the Declaration even if the requested exceptions were not approved. Britain and France declined the advances and the United States remained a non-signatory.\nConsequently, the Union passed a statutory authorization for President Lincoln to issue letters of marque and declared that all attempts to disrupt, capture or destroy Union shipping would be treated as piracy and dealt with as such. Regardless, the British entered the Civil War as privateers, sailing under letters of marque issued by the Confederacy. In fact, in a case brought by the United States against Britain for damages caused by a privateer, an international tribunal found no issue with a non-signatory (the Confederacy) issuing letters of marque to a signatory (Britain) “to construct, furnish, and crew ships to be used in commerce raids against a non-signatory, the United States.”\nWhen the United States entered into conflict with the Spanish during the Spanish American War, neither the United States nor Spain was a signatory to the Declaration of Paris. Not only did Spain specifically reserve the right to issue letters of marque, the Spanish government recognized\nAmerica’s right and ability to issue the same. The Spanish never carried out the threat, and President McKinley, for the first time, articulated a U.S. intention to comply with the Paris Declaration, though still not be a signatory.\nDespite the reluctance, both Spain and the United States found ways to unofficially authorize privateers without formally issuing letters of marque. Both nations organized “auxiliary cruisers of the Navy.” The United States Navy chartered private merchant ships, heavily armed them, and subsequently entered into naval service. The Navy used the ships and manned them with the owner’s regular, ostensibly civilian crew, placing the ships “under the entire control of the senior naval officer on board.” One such ship, the City of Paris, actually took prizes, with the United States Prize Court holding that she was not a “vessel of the Navy nor a privateer . . . ” and finally ruling that she was an “armed vessel in the service of the United States” and the civilian crew was “entitled as of right to share in the prize money.”\nWhile the nature of privateering changed with the Spanish-American War, privateering did not disappear. At the 1907 Hague Peace Conference, the United States again voiced its opposition to the privateering prohibition. Specifically, the United States voiced the same concerns as\n ADAMS, supra note 72, at 141; JAMES D.

This scheme seems to have originated with the Prussians, who created a “volunteer navy” in 1870 in an attempt to circumvent the restrictions agreed up in Paris.

Applying Letters of Marque to Cyber Warfare\nLetters of marque were the original “self-help” governmental authorization. While used to great effect in the past, they can now be resurrected and used to achieve similar results, especially in a cyber context. This section addresses the use of a cyber letter of marque in three areas: seizing assets; disrupting, disabling, and dismantling adversarial networks; and conducting cyber bounty hunting and rewards programs.\n## A. Seizing Assets\nIn a modern cyber letter of marque scheme, the U.S. government would authorize certain companies or individuals to track, freeze, and seize the illicit funds of designated criminal organizations. The net effect would be cutting off supplies to deliver the United States from its enemies. For example, the United States has recently named several Russians as “transnational criminals” and promulgated an Executive Order that authorizes “seizure of their assets in the United States and prevents them from banking in dollars anywhere in the world.”\nWhen rogue states, such as Iran, contravene the will of the international community, the most used method of ensuring compliance is via the United Nations Security Council or unilateral economic sanctions. The United States first instituted sanctions against Iran in 1979, following the seizure of the American Embassy during the Iranian Revolution. These sanctions included freezing roughly $11 billion in Iranian assets. Iran continues to launder and hide money in contravention of these resolutions, often with the help of international banks. In just one instance, the illicit transactions totaled $250 billion. Iran has also turned to China, specifically its banking system, for help in escaping economic sanctions. Illicit money laundering in contravention of United Nations resolutions is not limited to Iran, but has also included North Korea, Cuba, Sudan, and Mexican criminal cartels.\n See supra Part II.\n CHOATE, supra note 98, at 40.\n Id.\n Some have alleged that blimps operated on the west coast of the United States during World War II pursuant to letters of marque. “The Los Angeles based Resolute was the only airship . . . operated for the Navy under privateer status. . . .” JAMES SHOCK &amp; DAVID SMITH, THE GOODYEAR AIRSHIPS 43 (2002).

A cyber letter of marque would allow a privateer to seek these illicit funds wherever they may be hidden and either seize them or digitally sequester them for further law enforcement action. Such a cyber letter of marque brings to bear a formidable resource that will increase the likelihood for seizure of illicit funds and the shutdown of avenues for illicit funding.\nThe idea of using a letter of marque to effect an economic result is not novel. John Adams, in singing the virtues of privateering, said “[I]t is by cutting off supplies, not by attacks, sieges, or assaults, that I expect deliverance from enemies.”[119] While letters of marque during the\nRevolutionary War and the War of 1812 had distinct military objectives, they were \"also a means of commercial warfare conducted for profit.\"[120] Privateers \"were engaged not in patriotic, but business ventures.\"[121] Some privateers amassed great fortunes through their letter of marque commissions,[122] with even the common seaman receiving up to one thousand dollars above his regular wage from just one voyage.[123] The proceeds from captured enemy goods, once sold via the Unites States Prize Courts, were split between the privateer and the sovereign, thus providing a much needed injection of funds to the government and the privateer, while at the same time depriving the enemy of resources.[124]\nMotivated by the possibility of retaining a healthy percentage of the roughly $1.6 trillion presently illicitly laundered worldwide, the number of prospective cyber privateers would be legion. Consequently, the United States government would be in a position to demand an exorbitantly high bond, thus guaranteeing that only the most technically proficient and responsible cyber privateers would seek the commission. As for the cyber profiteer, the prospect of sharing a large percentage of the trillions of dollars, not to mention the potential for criminal or tort liability,[125] would ensure strict compliance with the terms of the letter of marque. As the privateer in the 1700s and 1800s provided both a much needed governmental funding stream[126] and served a valid national security function, so too would a modern cyber privateer by removing illicit funds from the hands of organized crime and sanction violators. The end result would be a potential death blow to crime organizations and rogue regimes.\nCurrently, the law restricts anyone from attempting to seize assets, whether they belong to the most deplorable rogue regime or the most vicious drug cartel. A cyber letter of marque would vest responsible and vetted entities with authority to digitally seize illicit funds while providing legal protections from criminal and/or civil liability. Current laws restricting attempted seizures would remain in place for those acting without a valid letter of marque or those\nAUGUST 2013 • THE ARMY LAWYER • DA PAM 27-50-483\noperating outside the scope of their letter of marque commissions.\n## B. Disrupting, Disabling, and Dismantling Adversarial Networks\nIn December 2012, a cybercriminal known as “vorVzakone” announced Project Blitzkrieg, wherein he planned to attack 30 Unites States banks in an attempt to steal money from accounts belonging to the “rich.” McAfee Labs, a leading computer security company, determined that this “is a credible threat to the financial industry and appears to be moving forward as planned.” The projected losses from the announced attack could reach “hundreds of millions of dollars.” The targets of the planned attack included Bank of America, Capitol One, Suntrust, Ameritrade, eTrade, and Fidelity and Schwab. From April to December 2012, vorVzakone claimed at least 500 cyber victims.\nAt roughly the same time that the U.S. banking industry began to deal with vorVzakone, bank officials were contending with cyber attacks emanating from Iran. The attack’s complexities are comparable to that of “a pack of fire-breathing Godzillas.” In fact, the internet traffic used in the attacks has been “multiple times” the number that Russia allegedly directed or encouraged at Estonia in a month-long online assault in 2007 that nearly crippled the\n Literally translated means “thief in law.” See KREBS ON SECURITY, New Findings Lend Credence to Project Blitzkrieg, http://krebsonsecurity.com/tag/vorvzakone-gozi-prinimalku/ (last visited Dec. 12, 2012).\n While the exact identity of vorKzakone is unknown, he is believed to be a male, as shown by alleged photographs of vorKzakone online.

These attacks continue because, in part, there is no disincentive for the bad actors, as they know nothing will happen to them. However, if the United States authorized tightly controlled offensive cyber capabilities via a congressionally authorized cyber letter of marque, the nation could allow a U.S. cyber entity to neutralize the attacker and their capabilities. As a direct consequence, the attacks will most likely cease and the attackers will move to easier targets. In essence, a cyber letter of marque would “arm” U.S. entities, thus allowing them to protect themselves in much the same way the historical letters of marque allowed merchant ships to arm themselves for self-defense purposes.\nAs with seizure of assets, ample historical support exists for the use of privateering in the disruption of enemy activity. As discussed previously, American privateers disrupted English commerce to such an extent that several London-based firms went bankrupt. British merchants,\ntheir livelihoods so disrupted and, in fact, disabled, put pressure on their own government to end the war and allow the Americans to have their independence. The financial toll on the enemy during the War of 1812 by American privateers was staggering, which in turn had the operative effect of weakening both British naval superiority and morale in England. If privateering proved to be such an effective defensive weapon in a naval context, it can certainly be used in a cyber context where disrupting an enemy’s attack can be done through a keyboard by a handful of individuals instead of through fourteen-gun warships manned by over a hundred crewmen.\n## C. Cyber Bounty Hunting\nThe realm of cyber letters of marque is not limited to offensive or defensive actions in the classic sense. A cyber letter of marque could also be utilized as a method of bounty hunting, providing information to law enforcement agencies necessary to apprehend a cyber attacker.\nBounty hunting, like a letter of marque, is an activity intertwined with the history of the United States. The United States Supreme Court endorsed bounty hunting as a legal activity in the 1872 case *Taylor v. Taintor*. The federal government endorsed, and continues to endorse, bounty hunting for capture (as opposed to kill) as exemplified in the most wanted lists.

This, arguably, would be illegal under current United States law.\nThe Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) serves as a barrier to a corporation or individual from coming to the aid of a cyber-attack victim. Congress could carefully draft cyber letter of marquee legislation authorizing such entities to track and digitally “capture” a cyber criminal or terrorist. The only difference between the reward/bounty programs currently operated by the United States Government and a cyber letter of marque is the antiquated CFAA prohibition.\nIndeed, other scholars have posited the use of bounty hunting letters of marque. For example, Robert P. DeWitte, writing in the Indiana Law Journal, discussed one of the potential downfalls between physical, as opposed to virtual, bounty hunting through the use of a letter of marque. In particular, he illuminated the legitimate concern that “state authorities could conceivably attempt to capture and/or kill privateers” in their territory while operating under a valid U.S. letter of marque. However, this concern in a cyber letter of marque context is not applicable since the cyber privateer/bounty hunter would be safely ensconced in the territorial United States, outside the physical reach of an unfriendly foreign armed force.\nJust as letters of marque are constitutional, so too are bounties, as over a hundred years of U.S. jurisprudence demonstrates. The issuance of a cyber letter of marque\n See, e.g., NAT’L ASS’N FUGITIVE RECOVERY AGENTS (N.A.F.R.A.), http://fugitive-recovery.org/ (last visited Dec. 24, 2012); NAT’L ASS’N BAIL BOND INVESTIGATORS, http://nabbi.org/ (last visited Dec. 24, 2012).\n The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1030 (2006), would most likely prevent a company or individual from taking these steps.

A cyber letter of marque would allow a cyber privateer access to those established and protected legal mechanisms.\n## IV. Legal Barriers\nDespite the many potential applications of a cyber letter of marque, some arguments raise concerns about the legality of its application. When discussing letters of marque, most commentators cite to the same alleged legal barriers to implementation: domestic law, usually the CFAA; the Law of Armed Conflict, specifically attribution and self-defense concerns; the Paris Declaration of 1856; and the Council of Europe Convention on Cyber-crime. This section examines each of these areas and analyzes why they are not legal barriers to the implementation of a cyber letter of marque regime.\n### A. The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act\nThe Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, initially a criminal statute protecting government computers and those computers belonging to entities with compelling government interests, forces companies under attack to “just stand and take a beating.” Since its passage in 1984, it has expanded to include civil liability by prohibiting anyone from “intentionally access[ing] a protected computer without authorization or exceed[ing] authorized access . . . [and recklessly causing damage involving a loss of] at least\n$5,000 in value.” The definition of a “protected computer” has expanded to cover not only U.S. government computers, but also any computer “used in a manner that affects interstate or foreign commerce.” Even those computers located outside the United States are protected. Potentially, every single computer connected to the internet anywhere in the world would be a “protected computer” pursuant to the CFAA, including, potentially, a blue-tooth-enabled garage door opener or coffeemaker in suburbia.\nWhile the CFAA prohibits the mere access to a protected computer, causing damage seems to be the lynchpin to triggering civil and criminal penalties under the CFAA. Some courts have homed in on the damage requirement, refusing to find civil or criminal liability. For example, in *Moulton v. VC3*, the court held that an unauthorized port scan and throughput test of a defendant’s servers is not a violation of the CFAA since no “damage” was caused. Likewise, in *United States v. Czubinski*, the court reversed the criminal conviction of an IRS agent who accessed a “protected computer” to satisfy his curiosity.\nWhile some of the judicial decisions seem to allow some degree of cyber intelligence collection under the current regulatory scheme, the courts clearly would not allow an entity to seize assets, whether they are being laundered at a major international bank or if information leading to their location is on a drug kingpin’s desktop\n\n This included not only government computers and networks, but also those of large banks, the New York Stock Exchange, etc. Robert B.

Consequently, government authorization would first be a necessity.\nDespite allowing for criminal and civil penalties, the CFAA is not an effective means of preventing cyber attacks. Some have argued that active-defense authorizations, such as a letter of marque, are not necessary as the cyber victim can turn over evidence of a cyber attack to the FBI for prosecution. While this might work in theory, in actual practice it leaves the cyber victim virtually remediless for a host of reasons. For one, law enforcement personnel are questionably competent when it comes to cyber attacks and cyber crime. Further, due to the global nature of cyber attacks, an American court might have a difficult time bringing a cyber attacker within its jurisdiction. Even if a cyber attack victim captures all the information necessary to conduct a thorough law enforcement investigation, the FBI has bungled such gift-wrapped cyber cases in the past.\nJust as cyber criminals are capable of seizing money from an individual’s bank accounts, cyber companies with the technical expertise can track down and seize illicit funds, given the proper governmental authorization. A cyber letter of marque would provide such authorization.\n## B. Attribution and Self-Defense\nAttribution is the legal requirement to positively identify the attacker prior to responding with force in self-defense. How does a prospective cyber privateer ensure it is striking the proper target and how does a cyber-privateer cover their tracks so as to not entice further attacks? Admittedly, discovering the source of a cyber attack is “the most important aspect of active defense.” It necessarily must be a requirement when issuing a cyber letter of marque to ensure that the privateer is targeting the proper bad actor. Critics have complained that it is too difficult to identify the attacker with sufficient accuracy to ensure a counter-attack is accurately aimed. While tracing an attack may not provide actionable results, and some technologies “limit the ability to make perfect surgical strikes with active defense,” the problem may not be as big as it appears. Some speculate that it is more difficult for the bad actor to identify the cyber privateer than it is for the cyber privateer to identify the bad actor.\nThe attribution concerns may, however, be a bit overblown. Even the Russian cyber attacks launched or encouraged against Estonia could be traced back to the “Russian intelligence apparatus.” In fact, “attribution to at least some level will almost always be possible.” While the exact technologies available to ensure accurate attribution, which can be done in seconds, are not the focus of this paper, such technology is not new and “is currently the subject of a significant amount of research aimed at improving accuracy and efficiency.” While it may not be feasible, or even possible, to accurately attribute 100 million cyber attacks, “it is clear that the current state of the\n See, e.g., NRC REPORT, supra note 18 (discussing the exemption for lawfully authorized law enforcement and intelligence agencies activities to the CFAA and how government agencies may commandeer private computes or pay for their usage).\n See supra Part I (discussing of the frequency of cyber attacks). The CFAA, in one form or another, has been in effect since 1984. It has had little to no affect on cyber attacks.\n See, e.g., Westby, supra note 147.\n Ms. Westby, while arguing a cyber victim should turn over information to law enforcement instead of proactively defending themselves, admits that “there are too few of them with skills adequate to match the sophisticated nature of today’s cyber criminals.” Id. Others have agreed with her assessment that there are too few cyber-competent law enforcement officers.

Paris Declaration of 1856\nMost critics of the letter of marque, regardless of its application, usually point to the Paris Declaration of 1856, noting that the United States is prohibited from employing privateers due to the agreement. This argument, however, is without merit.\nFirst, the Declaration does not apply to the United States per the plain language of the treaty. “The present Declaration is not and shall not be binding, except between those Powers who have acceded, or shall accede, to it.” The United States did not accede to it in 1856 and has not, in the ensuing 157 years, acceded to it. Under the rules of treaty interpretation, a treaty is binding only upon parties to it, and it “does not create either obligations or rights for a third State without its consent.” Further, in order to impose an obligation on a third State, it must “expressly accept that obligation in writing.” To date, the United States has not consented to the obligations of the Declaration in writing, as required by the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.\nAdditionally, the Declaration clearly pertains, and limits itself, to maritime law. Since a cyber letter of marque regime is not grounded in maritime law and letters of marque are specifically authorized in the United States Constitution, it is permissible under international law, Paris Declaration notwithstanding, to issue cyber letters of marque.\nOthers argue that the Declaration has become customary international law. While this might be true at first blush, it ignores the legal and historical fact. A nation, not otherwise bound by a treaty, does not become bound by operation of the rule of customary international law if it has been a persistent objector. In order to be considered a persistent objector, and therefore not bound by a treaty, the State “must have objected to the emergence of a new norm during its formation and continue to object afterwards.” Even if it has been state practice to follow the precepts in a treaty, non-signatory states can alter their actions in order to confront new threats.\nRegarding the Declaration of Paris, the United States objected during the formation of the proposed privateering ban and objected to the Declaration by passing legislation authorizing privateers during the Civil War; the Spanish government recognized America’s right to issue letters of marque during the Spanish-American War, and voiced opposition at the 1907 Hague Peace Conference. Clearly, the United States has been a persistent objector to the Declaration and thus not bound by it. Simply stated, American privateering declined not because of acquiescence to international treaties which it did not, and had no intent to, sign. Rather, privateering declined because America, after 1898, no longer had a nascent navy, had become a major\nAUGUST 2013 • THE ARMY LAWYER • DA PAM 27-50-483\nnaval power, and the “cost-saving advantages of privateering [had] declined.”\nAssuming, *arguendo*, that the Paris Declaration is customary international law that the United States must follow, the issuance of cyber letters of marque is still not banned. The Declaration never defines privateers. As history demonstrates, a contracted civilian ship can be armed, staffed with civilians, fight, and take prizes—all without violating the Declaration.\n## D. The Council of Europe Convention on Cyber-Crime\nOn 23 November 2001, the United States signed on to the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime. The Cybercrime Convention came into effect in the United States on 1 January 2007. The Cybercrime Convention’s main objective “is to pursue a common criminal policy aimed at the protection of society against cyber-crime, especially by adopting appropriate legislation and fostering international co-operation.” It purports to allow countries to work together through substantive, procedural, and jurisdictional laws against a cyber criminal committing crimes in one country while physically located in another. Prior to the Cybercrime Convention (and some would argue even today), the cyber police forces in the United States or internationally did not have the tools or authority necessary to combat cyber-attacks. Additionally, it did not address the\ncultural issues that may arise from crimes committed in cyberspace. To make matters worse, some countries did not have adequate laws against cyber-crime.\nAn attempt to correct these law enforcement deficiencies was the impetus for the creation of the Cybercrime Convention. It remains the only international treaty attempting to deal with the issue of transcontinental cyber attacks. It fails, however, to effectively protect anyone from cyber attacks. It is largely a symbolic document, serving mainly to reassure the public that governments are doing *something* to address the threat. Those reassurances are hollow, as only roughly half of the ratifying states have passed domestic legislation required to enforce the document.\nRemarkably, the exceptions contained in the Cybercrime Convention negate its impact. First, no requirement exists that any cyber attacker actually be prosecuted; instead, the State must merely “report the final outcome to the requesting Party [i.e., the cyber victim’s nation] in due course.” In addition, nearly every enforcement provision of the Cybercrime Convention contains a legislative flaw, allowing a nation state to refuse to cooperate. A nation may refuse a request for assistance during or after a cyber attack emanating from its country for a host of reasons. These reasons include, but are not limited to: if a request for assistance would violate domestic laws, if a request for assistance and information gained\nAUGUST 2013 • THE ARMY LAWYER • DA PAM 27-50-483\ntherefrom could be used in any investigation or court proceedings other than those listed in the request, or if an attacked nation believes there are political issues at play.\nPerhaps as a sign of the naïve belief that the feckless Cybercrime Convention will actually curb cyber attacks, the Council of Europe’s Committee of Experts on Terrorism opined in February 2010 that no further conventions are needed to address cyber terrorism because “large scale attacks on computer systems appeared to be already covered by the Cybercrime Convention.” Yet two days later, on 18 February 2010, The Washington Post broke the story that more than 75,000 computers and roughly 2,500 companies in the United States, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Turkey, and Mexico were victims of “one of the largest and most sophisticated attacks by cyber criminals discovered to date.” The attack began in 2008 and was not discovered until January 2010.\nIn the United States, an unnamed Department of Justice official purportedly alleged that the “impact of the convention [is] ‘very positive,’” which, again, seems to ignore the reality of cyber attack’s scope. To the contrary, the Cybercrime Convention seems to merely limit the ability of a law-abiding entity to take proactive steps necessary to cease a cyber threat.\nBecause the Cybercrime Convention does not diminish cyber attacks, lacks any enforcement or prosecution mechanism and expressly states that signatory states pass domestic criminal laws covering “illegal access,” “illegal interception,” criminal “misuse of devices,” [emphasis added], the United States is not prevented from issuing letters of marque. If Congress exercised its constitutionally authorized power to issue letters of marque, limited to cyber operations, no violation of any provision of the Convention would occur because no domestic criminal acts occur.\nEven the U.S. Attorney General stated, in 2006, that the Cybercrime Convention “is in full accord with all U.S. Constitutional protections.” The activity undertaken pursuant to a constitutionally authorized and congressionally endorsed cyber letter of marque would not, under United States law, be illegal and thus not a violation of any provision contained in the Cybercrime Convention. In short, a cyber letter of marque issued by Congress would not violate the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime.\n## V. Authorizations and Oversight\nWhile a cyber letter of marque is legal, both under domestic and international law, any cyber letter of marque regime must provide for a method of authorizing and subsequently supervising a cyber privateer. This section discusses some potential methods of authorization and oversight necessary for an effective cyber letter of marque regime.\n## A. Issuance of Bonds and Authorizations\nPrior to the issuance of a letter of marque, all prospective cyber privateers should be required to register with a central governmental database. This database would provide the supervising agency with a means of not only policing cyber privateers and holding them accountable, but also a means for parties allegedly aggrieved by United States authorized cyber privateers to seek redress. Such a database and registration would also allow the supervisory agency an opportunity to vet the putative cyber privateer. “If a company does not have the skills to defend its systems, it likely does not have the skills to attack back—or make\nAUGUST 2013 • THE ARMY LAWYER • DA PAM 27-50-483\n\nDo we really think that establishing a convention on cyber crime is going to stop our adversaries? They do not recognize our virtual boards or virtual sovereignty as it is. Why would they recognize a convention on cyber crime? All this does is force offensive cyber forces to establish an unwieldy ‘rules of engagement’ that ties the hands of those who can execute offensive cyber actions.\nBardin, *supra* note 13.\n\ndecisions about whether to engage in such actions.” If the applicant does not possess the requisite skills, then its request for a cyber letter of marque is denied.\nFurther, all applicants must be able to post a bond commensurate with potential liability exposure. “Letters of marque should only be issued to security firms able to post a significant bond and meet specific qualification and training requirements.” The bond requirement is the most effective method for screening out “start-ups” and “fly-by-night” security companies from seeking a letter of marque. The Act Concerning Letters-of-Marque, Prizes &amp; Prize Goods specifically states that before the issuance of any commission of letters of marque, a bond in the amount of five thousand dollars, or ten thousand dollars if the ship had more than one hundred and fifty men, would have to be paid by two “responsible sureties, not interested in such vessel.” The payment of such a steep bond ensures that privateers strictly adhere to congressional rules.\nIn a cyber context, since the stakes are so high, a prospective cyber privateer should be required to supply a large monetary bond. A large monetary bond would not only ensure that responsible entities apply for and receive cyber letters of marque, but also that those with the requisite discretion and technical expertise are the only ones acting with congressional authority as a cyber privateer. The prime importance of competent exercise of the powers enumerated in the letter of marque is underscored when the vast amount of money and intellectual property lost on a frequent and recurring basis, coupled with the exacting nature of establishing positive identification, especially attribution, is contemplated. A large monetary bond would, in effect, keep the cyber cutthroats out of this business.\nSingapore established CaseTrust, a similar system, in order to protect consumers engaged in e-commerce. CaseTrust receives complaints against e-vendors and legitimizes member companies. Prior to joining, a\nprospective e-vendor must give a banker’s guarantee, or a bond, to establish that it is indeed a legitimate and reputable company. The CaseTrust system provides for compulsory adjudication including the power to not only fine a vendor, but also to revoke its certification. As a result, the consumer is protected by providing a source of bonded companies and a policing mechanism. Additionally, the commercial entities are shrouded with governmental legitimacy. To date, enforcement has been effective and participation is growing.\nIn a historical context, the putative privateer kept detailed daily logs, which were available for inspection by any U.S. naval commander he might encounter. Similar requirements would be made of cyber privateers. As all internet activity can be, or actually is, easily monitored, this requirement does not place too onerous a burden on the purported cyber privateer. While most private companies are loathe to share details of their cyber activity for fear of losing intellectual property, a competitive edge, or disclose their cyber defenses or weaknesses, a company serious about executing a defensive or even offensive cyber letter of marque should be willing to accept the more stringent scrutiny, such as reviewing cyber logbooks.\nA cyber letter of marque would designate the bearers to be licensed combatants for the sovereign, authorizing them to “bear arms” in the cyber sense of the word, and either defend against specific attacks and launch counter attacks (back-backs) or engage in offensive cyber operations directed at sovereign selected targets or networks. A private company could be granted authorization to conduct a hack-back, temporarily incapacitating a cyber bad actor, and then notify the appropriate law enforcement or national security entity for final apprehension or network termination.\nAUGUST 2013 • THE ARMY LAWYER • DA PAM 27-50-483\nIn recognition that cyber privateers would, to a certain extent, be bearing arms, a workable set of rules of engagement would necessarily be a major part of the actual commission. Professor Susan Brenner has expressed concerns that cyber privateers could be motivated to vigilantism and exceed the bounds of their charter, exhibiting an inability to determine who is a just target. These concerns can be easily alleviated by carefully drafted rules of engagement and scope of authorization in the letter of marque commission itself. If cyber privateers exceed the scope of the commission, they lose their substantial bond, face debarment from future government contracts, and open themselves up to potential criminal prosecutions since their actions were outside the scope of the immunity granted by the letter of marque. These adverse ramifications should keep a vetted and approved cyber privateer in line.\n## B. Legal and Judicial Oversight\nThe legal framework for a workable letter of marque regime already exists under current federal law. “Privateering worked only because it was backed by a substantial system of law, not only the common law of property, but also the statutory creations such as admiralty courts and bond requirements.” The federal judiciary is vested with original jurisdiction to determine prizes, burdens of proof established, the due process rights of both the captor and the captive duly considered, and the\nsecuritylaw.us/2012/11/30/steven-chabinsky-crowdstrike-ex-fbi-cyber-division-talks-pprivate-sector-cyberdeterrence-at-abas-natsec-law-conference/.\n Brenner, supra note 212.\n See, e.g., Commissioning Private Vessels for Seizure of Piratical Vessels, 33 U.S.C. § 386 (2006).\nThe President is authorized to instruct the commanders of the public armed vessels of the United States, and to authorize the commanders of any other armed vessels sailing under the authority of any letters of marquee and reprisal granted by Congress, or the commanders of any other suitable vessels, to subdue, seize, take, and, if on the high seas, to send into any port of the United States, any vessel or boat built, purchased, fitted out, or held as mentions in 33 U.S.C. § 385.\nId.\n Tabarrok, supra note 21, at 572.\n Jurisdiction, 10 U.S.C. § 7652 (2006).\n See The Resolution, 2 U.S. 19 (U.S. 1781) (holding that the burden of proving a prize was captured lawfully lies with the captors).\n The legality of a capture is not determined until a court of competent jurisdiction has issued an order making such a determination. Id. Whether property seized may be confiscated as a prize is a judicial question and each case is to be decided on its own facts. Property Captured by the Potomac Flotilla, 10 Op. Att’y Gen. 467 (1863).\ninterests of the United States represented by a duly appointed authority in the “United States attorney for the district in which the prize cause is adjudicated.” In fact, Chapter 655 of 10 U.S.C. contains the entire statutory framework to judicially administer a letter of marque regime.\nHistorical precedence demonstrates that judicial oversight is an effective means to monitor and police privateers. For example, the court invalidated the first two prizes claimed during the War of 1812 because of improperly issued letters of marque. Even the venerable USS Constitution was also involved in an illegitimate capture, a situation embarrassingly rectified by the courts. Indeed, a rich legal history of privateering cases exists before the United States Supreme Court.\nSome are concerned that the government would not be able to control the behavior of modern privateers, especially in a cyber context. In reality, these concerns are easily addressed with stiff consequences. Penalties can include forfeiture of the bond and any pay due as a result of a successful capture or mission, seizure of assets, debarment from all future government contracts, exclusion from future letter of marque commissions, criminal prosecution, and potential tort liability.\nAt least two presidents proposed criminal prosecution for misuse of a letter of marque. President Jefferson, a major proponent of privateering during the Revolutionary War, declared that individuals operating off the coast without valid commissions be captured and tried as pirates.\n Duties of United States Attorney, 10 U.S.C.A. § 7656 (2012).\n Tabarrok, supra note 21, at 568.\n The United States paid the owners of the captured ship $11,000 in damages. PETRIE, supra note 122, at 160.\n See, e.g., In re The Amiable Isabella, Munos, 19 U.S. 1 (1821); The Adeline, 9 Cranch 244 (1815); The Amy Warwick, 67 U.S. 635 (1862).\n Brenner, supra note 212.\n Richard, supra note 19, at 455.\n In a cyber context, this could include all computers and network capabilities.\n\n See The Santissima Trinidad, 20 U.S. 283 (1822) (holding that illegal privateers, whether public or private, “are tortuous—and the original owner is entitled to restitution when brought within our jurisdiction”). Tort liability has real teeth, as government is generally immune from civil suit, whereas a letter of marque holder would not be. See David A. Sklansky, The Private Police, 46 UCLA L. REV. 1165, 1186 (1999); Richard, supra note 19, at 455.\n See supra Part II.\n UPTON, supra note 57, at 180.\nAUGUST 2013 • THE ARMY LAWYER • DA PAM 27-50-483\nPresident Lincoln made a similar proclamation regarding privateers hired by the Confederate States, as he did not believe the “rebellious” states had legal authority to issue letters of marque.\nAccording to some scholars, one of the major drawbacks of the traditional letter of marque system was the lack of organization or unified command, control and communication. To address this concern, all cyber letter of marque holders would report their activities and progress to a central authority on a regular and recurring basis. This central authority would have the ability to terminate the cyber privateer’s commission and/or refer the matter to the Department of Justice for criminal prosecution, should the commissioner act outside the bounds of authority. As this central authority would have an over-arching view of which cyber privateers were acting in which arenas, they could deconflict any possible issues of interrupting law enforcement, intelligence, or national security operations in cyber space. Additionally, purely governmental agencies, such as the National Security Agency, would then be in a better position to work in concert with the cyber privateers to execute specific targeted operations.\n## VI. Conclusion\n“More destructive cyber weapons are being created every day . . . [eventually] . . . those who mean to harm the United States will gain the ability to launch a damaging attack. The United States must develop stronger defenses before this occurs.” Despite this threat, the U.S. government seems to be content with merely allowing network owners to “[sit] there . . . trying to swat away these intrusions.” Industry experts have specifically asked that Congress “provide opportunities and responsibilities to the private sector to hack back.”\nPerhaps in tacit acknowledgement that the private sector is better prepared to handle cyber issues, the United States Air Force solicits private industry for capabilities designed to “destroy, deny, degrade, disrupt, deceive, corrupt, or usurp the adversaries [sic] ability to use the cyberspace domain for his advantage.”\nAdditionally, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DAPRA), through its “Plan X,” sought “innovative research proposals” in an effort to “dominate the cyber battle space.” Congress has not only denied these requests, while at the same time ignoring the Air Force and DARPA’s proposed use of private industry, but at the same time tied their hands with respect to possible civil and criminal liability. Members of Congress have instead suggested legislative mandates requiring “owners and operators of vital infrastructure [to] better protect networks,” or even tax credits as a means of encouraging corporations to establish stricter cyber security safeguards. Congress has failed to provide industry with the tools they are desperately asking for: a means in which to protect themselves in a meaningful way.\nPolitical policy makers must understand that “[i]n cyberspace, the offense has the upper hand” and the nation cannot remain secure while hiding behind a mythical all protective firewall. Accordingly, Congress should exercise its constitutional authority and authorize the\n\nissuance of cyber letters of marque and allow American entities to actively defend themselves in cyber space.\nAs delineated above, the letter of marque has a rich tradition, not only in international and maritime law, but also in American history. Were it not for this power, the United States might not ever have gained her freedom, much less secured it in the War of 1812. The United States justly refused to acquiesce to a ban on privateering and that ban is not binding to this day. As advanced in this article, a cyber letter of marque can, with adequate safeguards in place, protect our current infrastructure, obtain information on emerging threats, and then eliminate such threats. Taking into account the current state of the law and\nthe restrictions that prevent an adequate method of cyber self-defense, it becomes clear that a well thought out cyber letter of marque scheme would be able to address the fears that led to the enactment of the CFAA.\nThe current legal framework allows hackers to do what they please, while network owners must follow onerous statutory rules. The issuance of cyber letters of marque is a constitutionally authorized method of self-defense Congress should authorize to level the cyber playing field.\n “Historian Faye M. Kert offers the judgment that ‘without the presence of the American privateers in the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812, the United States would never have been able to hold off the British Navy.’” SECHREST, supra note 31, at 7.\n See infra Part III.\n This addresses the emotional and intellectually dishonest reactions of “vigilante justice in cyberspace . . . notions of pirates on the high seas and wild west posses” as voiced by people such as Jim Richards of Tangent Capital. Egan, supra note 293.\n Some complain that to allow active-defense, cyberspace would devolve into a “wild west.” (“Allowing companies an exception to the CFAA really would turn the Internet into the Wild West.”). Westby, supra note 147.\nIt is in many ways the Wild West. Cyberspace has many similarities to a Wild West world . . . The message of this metaphor for cyberspace security is clear: If there is no way to enforce law and order throughout all of cyberspace, which appears to be the case, one must rely on local enclaves of law and order, and trusted friends.\nRICHARD O. HUNDLEY &amp; ROBERT H. ANDERSON, EMERGING CHALLENGE SECURITY AND SAFETY IN CYBERSPACE 12, reprinted from IEEE TECHNOLOGY AND SOCIETY MAGAZINE (1995/1996). International scholars have also recognized the Wild West nature of the internet. See Richard de Silva, Cyber Law: Navigating the Legalities of Digital Weapons, CYBER DEF. &amp; NETWORK SECURITY, Oct. 2012.\n “It’s unfair that hackers can do whatever they want and companies have to follow rules . . .” said Ronen Kenig, director of security product marketing at Radware.” Egan, supra note 293.\nAUGUST 2013 • THE ARMY LAWYER • DA PAM 27-50-483",

The letter of marque²⁷ and privateering concepts have been a part of both international law and the accepted norms of warfare for centuries,²⁸ despite the Declaration of Paris—which purportedly banned privateering.²⁹ Hugo Grotius, considered by many to be the father of the modern Law of Armed Conflict, noted that letters of marque and reprisal are endorsed by the entirety of the law of nations.³⁰ Historians credit the expansion and development of the Western world from 1600 to 1815 to privateers.³¹ The letter of marque originally served as a “self-help” authorization, allowing a private individual to seek reprisal against a foreigner who caused him harm.³² Over time, this developed into a government’s authorization to act on its behalf and seize property belonging to an enemy government, usually in the form of ships and cargo.³³ In its most fundamental form, a letter or marque authorized private merchant ships to carry arms in self-defense.³⁴ Upon its founding, due to its small navy,³⁵ not only did the United States employ letters of marque, but it also was “the world’s biggest proponent of privateering.”³⁶ The Continental Congress issued many letters of marque,³⁷ as did individual states.³⁸ In fact, John Adams reportedly called an early letter of marque scheme, the Massachusetts Armed Vessels Act, “one of the most important documents of the Revolution.”³⁹ Thomas Jefferson was also an ardent proponent of privateering: “every possible encouragement should be given to privateering in time of war.... Our national ships are too few... to... retaliate the [sic] acts of the enemy. But by licensing private armed vessels, the whole naval force of the nation is truly brought to bear on the foe.”⁴⁰ Jefferson also realized that letters of marque served more than an offensive purpose, detailing how they are also a means of self-defense: The ship Jane is an English merchant vessel... employed in the commerce between Jamaica and these States. She brought here a cargo of produce... and was to take away... flour. Knowing of the war when she left Jamaica, and that our coast was lined with small French privateers, she armed for her defense [sic], and took one of those commissions usually called letters of marque. She arrived here safely... Can it be necessary to say that a merchant vessel is not a privateer? That though she has arms to defend herself in time of war, in the course of her regular commerce, this no more makes her a privateer, than a husbandman following his plough in time of war, with a knife or pistol in his pocket, is thereby made a soldier. The occupation of a privateer is attack and plunder, that of a merchant AUGUST 2013 • THE ARMY LAWYER • DA PAM 27-50-483 vessel is commerce and self-preservation.⁴¹ Support for letters of marque by the founding fathers was not merely philosophical consent. Thomas Paine and George Washington both owned stock in privateering ventures.⁴² Additionally, Benjamin Franklin practically ran his own privateering operation while he was assigned to France.⁴³ While most privateering ventures were for money, Franklin used the captured British ships, goods and men to trade for American prisoners of war.⁴⁴ Privateering in general weakened an enemy’s economy and its ability to wage war.⁴⁵ The American privateers devastated British commerce, funding the first two years of the war substantially through British captures.⁴⁶ By early 1777, the British had lost 250 ships, resulting in the collapse of several major London-based West India merchant companies.⁴⁷ Within a year, American privateers captured 559 British ships.⁴⁸ Of the approximately 796 British ships captured during the Revolutionary War, American privateers and armed merchant ships accounted for roughly 600.⁴⁹ British merchants, feeling the crippling effect of American privateers,⁵⁰ ensured that “every pressure was brought to bear on Parliament for [the Revolutionary War’s] discontinuance.”⁵¹ Even ships carrying linen from England to Ireland feared the American privateers, to the point of demanding warship escorts.⁵² At the outset of the War of 1812, the British Navy consisted of 1,060 warships. In contrast, the United States Navy had only sixteen, including several that were unfit for sea.⁵³ As a consequence, the United States Navy was not considered to be a serious threat to British naval superiority.⁵⁴ In response, Congress passed a statute authorizing the use of privateers, but tightly controlled them.⁵⁵ The President could revoke, “at pleasure,” any letters of marque he issued after June 1812. The applicant had to list specific details about the ship, crew, and owners, and “Ample security” submitted to ensure compliance with both international and United States law. Further, and perhaps most relevant to modern application, the ship commanders were required to keep a detailed log of everything “that occurs, daily, and transmit them to the government,” and regular United States Navy commanders had to examine these logbooks when “meeting the privateer at sea.”⁵⁶ Failure to abide by these rules would mean forfeiture of the bond and “of all interest in any captures which they may make.”⁵⁷ With this new authorization in hand, American privateers wreaked havoc on British shipping and secured victory in America’s second war for independence.⁵⁸ In the process, privateers tallied $39 million in prizes, or roughly $672.5 million in 2012 dollars.⁵⁹ Following the War of 1812, letters of marque did not disappear from the American landscape. President Andrew Jackson, in 1834, discussed the use of letters of marque against France.⁶⁰ Texas, upon declaring independence from Mexico, realized its coast was vulnerable due to a nascent navy. In response, the fledgling Texas legislature began to issue letters of marque with the intent to “protect the coast, harass Mexican shipping, and bring prizes that could be ⁴¹ Richard, supra note 19, at 437 (citing Letter from Thomas Jefferson, to Gouverneur Morris (Aug. 16, 1793)), in 3 MEMOIR, CORRESPONDENCE AND MISCELLANIES FROM THE PAPERS OF THOMAS JEFFERSON 275 (1829)."

Seizing Assets In a modern cyber letter of marque scheme, the U.S. government would authorize certain companies or individuals to track, freeze, and seize the illicit funds of designated criminal organizations. The net effect would be cutting off supplies to deliver the United States from its enemies.¹⁰⁵ For example, the United States has recently named several Russians as “transnational criminals” and promulgated an Executive Order that authorizes “seizure of their assets in the United States and prevents them from banking in dollars anywhere in the world.”¹⁰⁶ When rogue states, such as Iran, contravene the will of the international community, the most used method of ensuring compliance is via the United Nations Security Council or unilateral economic sanctions.¹⁰⁷ The United States first instituted sanctions against Iran in 1979, following the seizure of the American Embassy during the Iranian Revolution. These sanctions included freezing roughly $11 billion in Iranian assets.¹⁰⁸ Iran continues to launder and hide money in contravention of these resolutions, often with the help of international banks.¹⁰⁹ In just one instance, the illicit transactions totaled $250 billion.¹¹⁰ Iran has also turned to China, specifically its banking system, for help in escaping economic sanctions.¹¹¹ Illicit money laundering in contravention of United Nations resolutions is not limited to Iran, but has also included North Korea, Cuba, Sudan, and Mexican criminal cartels.¹¹² ⁹⁹ See supra Part II."

Attribution and Self-Defense Attribution is the legal requirement to positively identify the attacker prior to responding with force in self-defense.²⁰⁰ How does a prospective cyber privateer ensure it is striking the proper target²⁰¹ and how does a cyber-privateer cover their tracks so as to not entice further attacks? Admittedly, discovering the source of a cyber attack is “the most important aspect of active defense.”²⁰² It necessarily must be a requirement when issuing a cyber letter of marque to ensure that the privateer is targeting the proper bad actor. Critics have complained that it is too difficult to identify the attacker with sufficient accuracy to ensure a counter-attack is accurately aimed.²⁰³ While tracing an attack may not provide actionable results, and some technologies “limit the ability to make perfect surgical strikes with active defense,”²⁰⁴ the problem may not be as big as it appears. Some speculate that it is more difficult for the bad actor to identify the cyber privateer than it is for the cyber privateer to identify the bad actor.²⁰⁵ The attribution concerns may, however, be a bit overblown.²⁰⁶ Even the Russian cyber attacks launched or encouraged against Estonia could be traced back to the “Russian intelligence apparatus.”²⁰⁷ In fact, “attribution to at least some level will almost always be possible.”²⁰⁸ While the exact technologies available to ensure accurate attribution, which can be done in seconds, are not the focus of this paper, such technology is not new and “is currently the subject of a significant amount of research aimed at improving accuracy and efficiency.”²⁰⁹ While it may not be feasible, or even possible, to accurately attribute 100 million cyber attacks,²¹⁰ “it is clear that the current state of the ¹⁹³ See, e.g., NRC REPORT, supra note 18 (discussing the exemption for lawfully authorized law enforcement and intelligence agencies activities to the CFAA and how government agencies may commandeer private computes or pay for their usage)."

Kessinger* ## I. Introduction At any given time, millions upon millions of people connect to each other via cyberspace.¹ While a convenient method for grandparents to view pictures of their grandchildren, the Internet is also an exceedingly effective vehicle by which to attack a state, a company, or an individual. These attacks occur with frightening frequency, over 1,000 per hour in Great Britain alone²; and Britain recognizes the severity of the cyber threat.³ In the first four days of the November 2012 fighting between Israel and Gaza militants, over 44 million attacks on Israeli websites⁴ and an estimated 100 million total attacks occurred.⁵ Cyber-attacks cost Australia “an average of $2 million per incident” and exceed a billion dollars per year.⁶ Successful attacks also occur against international bodies, such as the International Atomic Energy Agency.⁷ These cyber attacks seek not only military targets, but also industrial espionage.⁸ Despite the frequency and increasing severity of cyber attacks,⁹ many governments and industries around the world, to include the United States, are either seemingly helpless against the cyber onslaught,¹⁰ too dysfunctional¹¹ to create a useful offensive or defensive cyber scheme,¹² or are “highly immature with limited vision and strategic foresight.”¹³ Some foreign jurisdictions, our allies¹⁴ in the fight against cyber-attacks, fail to stem the tide of these attacks and now punish the cyber victims.¹⁵ This article explores the improbable, if not politically impossible, application of the letter of marque concept to the cyber arena. Despite the likely political stigma such a proposition would have in today’s Congress, letters of marque are nevertheless a constitutional and valid tool to execute cyber operations, and thus worthy of discussion.\nProposed defenses to cyber attacks are becoming increasingly complex and bizarre.¹⁶ However, one * U.S. Army, Judge Advocate.

Militarily, the government retains control over the letter of marque holder (a\"privateer\") and responsibilities as delineated within the express terms of the letter of marque while at the same time broadening the military's reach. As a law enforcement tool, a letter of marque deputizes an individual or company, thus vesting that entity with police powers. This authority allows the privateer to detain targets, bring them before the sovereign, and receive compensation based on successes, much like a bounty hunter. Using civilian forces in a military/national defense context is not a concept limited to antiquity. For example, monitored non-governmental civilian participation in governmental operations exists with private military contractors. The United States spent over $300 billion on military contractors from 2001–2007.\nThere is an apparent aversion to the use of letter of marque and privateers. Various bills introduced throughout the years proposing the revival of letter of marque have stalled or failed outright. Despite the hesitation, letters of marque and privateers served a legitimate military purpose, both in supplementing regular combat forces and crippling enemy commerce while protecting American commerce. A cyber letter of marque would enable a privateer to seize digital assets, disrupt fiscal and communication networks, destroy attacking networks, and act as a cyber bounty hunter.\nApplying a letter of marque scheme to the cyber world would not only provide authority for American companies to defend themselves from cyber threats, but also allow them to take proactive measures to neutralize a cyber threat before it coalesces into danger. In addition to providing requisite authorization, a letter of marque scheme would regulate the conduct of a prospective cyber privateer and ensure accountability to effect compliance with the letter of marque's mandate.\nPart II of this article examines the historical usage of letters of marque and privateers. A brief historical discussion shows the use of letters of marque in national defense. Such historical perspective provides a useful background when considering their application to cyberspace. Part III applies legal and historical principles to a modern letter of marque regime. In particular, the application of letters of marque within the context of existing technologies and proposed authorization and oversight safeguards are examined. The various laws implicated in a modern cyber letter of marque regime are reviewed in Part IV. Finally, Part V addresses the authorizations and oversight necessary to effectively manage a successful, and lawful, cyber letter of marque regime. While not meant to be an exhaustive analysis of all possible facets related to the implementation of a cyber letter of marque regime, this article shows that despite some initial political and legal issues, using a cyber letter of marque can effectively mitigate the threats posed by cyber attacks.",

In all, Texas issued six letters of marque.⁶¹ Similarly, President Polk recognized the lawful ability of Mexico to issue letters of marque during the Mexican American War.⁶² In 1856, Britain, France and other titular world powers met in Paris to discuss concerns arising from wartime maritime law.⁶³ France and Great Britain sought to end privateering as they could not effectively control the use of privateers by their enemies, i.e., the United States and Russia.⁶⁴ Great Britain, in particular, recognized privateering as an effective tool of weaker navies that posed a threat to its naval supremacy and sought to contain it.⁶⁵ The result of this meeting was the Paris Declaration of 1856, a document attempting to ban privateering.⁶⁶ The Paris Declaration contained three major provisions:⁶⁷ the first provided that “[p]rivateering is, and remains, abolished;” the second prevented the seizing of enemy goods on neutral ships; and the third prevented capture of neutral goods on enemy ships.⁶⁸ Most importantly, the Declaration went to great pains to ensure that its provisions did not apply to any nation save signatories.⁶⁹ This provision is important for two reasons.\nFirst, it made clear that it was not intended to be a universal ban on privateering, as it only applied to signatory nations at war with other signatories.⁷⁰ Second, as stated in the document, it did not have the power to police the actions of non-signatories.⁷¹ The United States recognized that this agreement was merely a means for England to maintain maritime supremacy at the expense of nations with a smaller seafaring force, and accordingly, demanded conditions prior to capitulation.⁷² The United States agreed to acquiesce and sign the document only if protection of all non-contraband private property from capture at sea was included.⁷³ The United States reasoned that since all private property is protected on land, “why should it not be [protected] also on the sea?”⁷⁴ While the United States wanted to ensure it would be allowed to trade with both sides of a conflict, free from privateer entanglements, another more vital concern existed. According to Secretary of State William L. Marcy, “the United States could not forgo the right to send out privateers, which in the past had proved her most effective maritime weapon in time of war, and which, since she had no large navy, were essential to her fighting power.”⁷⁵ The United States realized that if privateering was banned, its nascent navy⁷⁶ would be no match for the greater naval might of countries such as Britain and France.⁷⁷ As the plenipotentiaries who signed the Declaration would not adequately address American concerns regarding private goods, and factoring in Marcy’s concern about the resulting unequal balance of naval power, the United States refused to sign the agreement.⁷⁸ The issue of privateering arose again in April 1861 when Confederate President Jefferson Davis, with Confederate Congressional approval,⁷⁹ issued letters of ⁶¹ TEXAS PRIVATEERS, https://www.tsl.state.tx.us/exhibits/navy/privateers.html (last modified Aug. 30, 2011).\n⁶² Although President Polk did take issue with the blank letters of marque issued by Mexico, arguing those were illegal under international law and those acting in accordance with such letters are considered to be pirates.

Perhaps fearing the involvement of the British or French navies in the conflict, the Union declared that it would follow the Declaration and not issue letters of marque and Secretary of State Seward instructed American ambassadors to determine whether the signatories would be amicable to incorporating the proposed changes advocated by Marcy, thus allowing the United States to formally sign the Declaration.⁸¹ As an indication of the Union’s fear of privateers, Secretary Seward authorized acquiescence to the Declaration even if the requested exceptions were not approved.⁸² Britain and France declined the advances and the United States remained a non-signatory.⁸³ Consequently, the Union passed a statutory authorization for President Lincoln to issue letters of marque⁸⁴ and declared that all attempts to disrupt, capture or destroy Union shipping would be treated as piracy and dealt with as such.⁸⁵ Regardless, the British entered the Civil War as privateers, sailing under letters of marque issued by the Confederacy. In fact, in a case brought by the United States against Britain for damages caused by a privateer, an international tribunal found no issue with a non-signatory (the Confederacy) issuing letters of marque to a signatory (Britain) “to construct, furnish, and crew ships to be used in commerce raids against a non-signatory, the United States.”⁸⁶ When the United States entered into conflict with the Spanish during the Spanish American War, neither the United States nor Spain was a signatory to the Declaration of Paris.⁸⁷ Not only did Spain specifically reserve the right to issue letters of marque,⁸⁸ the Spanish government recognized America’s right and ability to issue the same.⁸⁹ The Spanish never carried out the threat, and President McKinley, for the first time, articulated a U.S. intention to comply with the Paris Declaration, though still not be a signatory.⁹⁰ Despite the reluctance, both Spain and the United States found ways to unofficially authorize privateers without formally issuing letters of marque.⁹¹ Both nations organized “auxiliary cruisers of the Navy.”⁹² The United States Navy chartered private merchant ships, heavily armed them, and subsequently entered into naval service.⁹³ The Navy used the ships and manned them with the owner’s regular, ostensibly civilian crew, placing the ships “under the entire control of the senior naval officer on board.”⁹⁴ One such ship, the City of Paris,⁹⁵ actually took prizes, with the United States Prize Court holding that she was not a “vessel of the Navy nor a privateer...”⁹⁶ and finally ruling that she was an “armed vessel in the service of the United States” and the civilian crew was “entitled as of right to share in the prize money.”⁹⁷ While the nature of privateering changed with the Spanish-American War, privateering did not disappear. At the 1907 Hague Peace Conference, the United States again voiced its opposition to the privateering prohibition.⁹⁸ Specifically, the United States voiced the same concerns as ⁸⁰ ADAMS, supra note 72, at 141; JAMES D.

The Prussians proposed putting civilian merchant seaman in Prussian navy uniforms and leaving them in command of their civilian ships. The French protested, claiming this to be privateering, in violation of the Declaration of Paris, and appealed to the British Secretary of Foreign Affairs, who sided with Prussia.

Applying Letters of Marque to Cyber Warfare Letters of marque were the original “self-help” governmental authorization.¹⁰⁴ While used to great effect in the past, they can now be resurrected and used to achieve similar results, especially in a cyber context. This section addresses the use of a cyber letter of marque in three areas: seizing assets; disrupting, disabling, and dismantling adversarial networks; and conducting cyber bounty hunting and rewards programs.",
    "## A. Seizing Assets In a modern cyber letter of marque scheme, the U.S. government would authorize certain companies or individuals to track, freeze, and seize the illicit funds of designated criminal organizations. The net effect would be cutting off supplies to deliver the United States from its enemies.¹⁰⁵ For example, the United States has recently named several Russians as “transnational criminals” and promulgated an Executive Order that authorizes “seizure of their assets in the United States and prevents them from banking in dollars anywhere in the world.”¹⁰⁶ When rogue states, such as Iran, contravene the will of the international community, the most used method of ensuring compliance is via the United Nations Security Council or unilateral economic sanctions.¹⁰⁷ The United States first instituted sanctions against Iran in 1979, following the seizure of the American Embassy during the Iranian Revolution. These sanctions included freezing roughly $11 billion in Iranian assets.¹⁰⁸ Iran continues to launder and hide money in contravention of these resolutions, often with the help of international banks.¹⁰⁹ In just one instance, the illicit transactions totaled $250 billion.¹¹⁰ Iran has also turned to China, specifically its banking system, for help in escaping economic sanctions.¹¹¹ Illicit money laundering in contravention of United Nations resolutions is not limited to Iran, but has also included North Korea, Cuba, Sudan, and Mexican criminal cartels.¹¹² ⁹⁹ See supra Part II.": "¹⁰⁰ CHOATE, supra note 98, at 40.\n¹⁰¹ Id.\n¹⁰² Some have alleged that blimps operated on the west coast of the United States during World War II pursuant to letters of marque. “The Los Angeles based Resolute was the only airship... operated for the Navy under privateer status....” JAMES SHOCK &amp; DAVID SMITH, THE GOODYEAR AIRSHIPS 43 (2002).

A cyber letter of marque would allow a privateer to seek these illicit funds wherever they may be hidden and either seize them or digitally sequester them for further law enforcement action. Such a cyber letter of marque brings to bear a formidable resource that will increase the likelihood for seizure of illicit funds and the shutdown of avenues for illicit funding.\nThe idea of using a letter of marque to effect an economic result is not novel. John Adams, in singing the virtues of privateering, said “[I]t is by cutting off supplies, not by attacks, sieges, or assaults, that I expect deliverance from enemies.”[119] While letters of marque during the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812 had distinct military objectives, they were\"also a means of commercial warfare conducted for profit.\"[120] Privateers\"were engaged not in patriotic, but business ventures.\"[121] Some privateers amassed great fortunes through their letter of marque commissions,[122] with even the common seaman receiving up to one thousand dollars above his regular wage from just one voyage.[123] The proceeds from captured enemy goods, once sold via the Unites States Prize Courts, were split between the privateer and the sovereign, thus providing a much needed injection of funds to the government and the privateer, while at the same time depriving the enemy of resources.[124] Motivated by the possibility of retaining a healthy percentage of the roughly $1.6 trillion presently illicitly laundered worldwide, the number of prospective cyber privateers would be legion. Consequently, the United States government would be in a position to demand an exorbitantly high bond, thus guaranteeing that only the most technically proficient and responsible cyber privateers would seek the commission. As for the cyber profiteer, the prospect of sharing a large percentage of the trillions of dollars, not to mention the potential for criminal or tort liability,[125] would ensure strict compliance with the terms of the letter of marque. As the privateer in the 1700s and 1800s provided both a much needed governmental funding stream[126] and served a valid national security function, so too would a modern cyber privateer by removing illicit funds from the hands of organized crime and sanction violators. The end result would be a potential death blow to crime organizations and rogue regimes.\nCurrently, the law restricts anyone from attempting to seize assets, whether they belong to the most deplorable rogue regime or the most vicious drug cartel. A cyber letter of marque would vest responsible and vetted entities with authority to digitally seize illicit funds while providing legal protections from criminal and/or civil liability. Current laws restricting attempted seizures would remain in place for those acting without a valid letter of marque or those AUGUST 2013 • THE ARMY LAWYER • DA PAM 27-50-483 operating outside the scope of their letter of marque commissions.",

As discussed previously,¹⁵⁴ American privateers disrupted English commerce to such an extent that several London-based firms went bankrupt.¹⁵⁵ British merchants, their livelihoods so disrupted and, in fact, disabled, put pressure on their own government to end the war and allow the Americans to have their independence.¹⁵⁶ The financial toll on the enemy during the War of 1812 by American privateers was staggering, which in turn had the operative effect of weakening both British naval superiority and morale in England. If privateering proved to be such an effective defensive weapon in a naval context, it can certainly be used in a cyber context where disrupting an enemy’s attack can be done through a keyboard by a handful of individuals instead of through fourteen-gun warships manned by over a hundred crewmen.¹⁵⁷ ## C. Cyber Bounty Hunting The realm of cyber letters of marque is not limited to offensive or defensive actions in the classic sense. A cyber letter of marque could also be utilized as a method of bounty hunting, providing information to law enforcement agencies necessary to apprehend a cyber attacker.\nBounty hunting, like a letter of marque, is an activity intertwined with the history of the United States.

This, arguably, would be illegal under current United States law.¹⁷⁰ The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) serves as a barrier to a corporation or individual¹⁷¹ from coming to the aid of a cyber-attack victim. Congress could carefully draft cyber letter of marquee legislation authorizing such entities to track and digitally “capture” a cyber criminal or terrorist. The only difference between the reward/bounty programs currently operated by the United States Government and a cyber letter of marque is the antiquated CFAA prohibition.\nIndeed, other scholars have posited the use of bounty hunting letters of marque.¹⁷² For example, Robert P. DeWitte, writing in the Indiana Law Journal, discussed one of the potential downfalls between physical, as opposed to virtual, bounty hunting through the use of a letter of marque. In particular, he illuminated the legitimate concern that “state authorities could conceivably attempt to capture and/or kill privateers” in their territory while operating under a valid U.S. letter of marque.¹⁷³ However, this concern in a cyber letter of marque context is not applicable since the cyber privateer/bounty hunter would be safely ensconced in the territorial United States, outside the physical reach of an unfriendly foreign armed force.\nJust as letters of marque are constitutional,¹⁷⁴ so too are bounties, as over a hundred years of U.S. jurisprudence demonstrates.¹⁷⁵ The issuance of a cyber letter of marque ¹⁶⁹ See, e.g., NAT’L ASS’N FUGITIVE RECOVERY AGENTS (N.A.F.R.A.), http://fugitive-recovery.org/ (last visited Dec. 24, 2012); NAT’L ASS’N BAIL BOND INVESTIGATORS, http://nabbi.org/ (last visited Dec. 24, 2012).\n¹⁷⁰ The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1030 (2006), would most likely prevent a company or individual from taking these steps.

A cyber letter of marque would allow a cyber privateer access to those established and protected legal mechanisms.",
    "## IV. Legal Barriers Despite the many potential applications of a cyber letter of marque, some arguments raise concerns about the legality of its application. When discussing letters of marque, most commentators cite to the same alleged legal barriers to implementation: domestic law, usually the CFAA; the Law of Armed Conflict, specifically attribution and self-defense concerns; the Paris Declaration of 1856; and the Council of Europe Convention on Cyber-crime. This section examines each of these areas and analyzes why they are not legal barriers to the implementation of a cyber letter of marque regime.": "### A. The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act,¹⁷⁷ initially a criminal statute protecting government computers and those computers belonging to entities with compelling government interests,¹⁷⁸ forces companies under attack to “just stand and take a beating.”¹⁷⁹ Since its passage in 1984, it has expanded¹⁸⁰ to include civil liability by prohibiting anyone from “intentionally access[ing] a protected computer without authorization or exceed[ing] authorized access... [and recklessly causing damage¹⁸¹ involving a loss¹⁸² of] at least $5,000 in value.”¹⁸³ The definition of a “protected computer” has expanded to cover not only U.S. government computers, but also any computer “used in a manner that affects interstate or foreign commerce.”¹⁸⁴ Even those computers located outside the United States are protected.¹⁸⁵ Potentially, every single computer connected to the internet anywhere in the world would be a “protected computer” pursuant to the CFAA,¹⁸⁶ including, potentially, a blue-tooth-enabled garage door opener or coffeemaker in suburbia.¹⁸⁷ While the CFAA prohibits the mere access to a protected computer, causing damage seems to be the lynchpin to triggering civil and criminal penalties under the CFAA. Some courts have homed in on the damage requirement, refusing to find civil or criminal liability. For example, in *Moulton v. VC3*,¹⁸⁸ the court held that an unauthorized port scan and throughput test of a defendant’s servers is not a violation of the CFAA¹⁸⁹ since no “damage” was caused. Likewise, in *United States v. Czubinski*,¹⁹⁰ the court reversed the criminal conviction of an IRS agent who accessed a “protected computer” to satisfy his curiosity.¹⁹¹ While some of the judicial decisions seem to allow some degree of cyber intelligence collection under the current regulatory scheme,¹⁹² the courts clearly would not allow an entity to seize assets, whether they are being laundered at a major international bank or if information leading to their location is on a drug kingpin’s desktop ¹⁷⁶ 31 U.S.C. §§ 3729–3733 (2006).\n¹⁷⁷ 18 U.S.C. § 1030 (2006).\n¹⁷⁸ This included not only government computers and networks, but also those of large banks, the New York Stock Exchange, etc. Robert B.

Consequently, government authorization would first be a necessity.¹⁹³ Despite allowing for criminal and civil penalties, the CFAA is not an effective means of preventing cyber attacks.¹⁹⁴ Some have argued that active-defense authorizations, such as a letter of marque, are not necessary as the cyber victim can turn over evidence of a cyber attack to the FBI for prosecution.¹⁹⁵ While this might work in theory, in actual practice it leaves the cyber victim virtually remediless for a host of reasons. For one, law enforcement personnel are questionably competent when it comes to cyber attacks and cyber crime.¹⁹⁶ Further, due to the global nature of cyber attacks, an American court might have a difficult time bringing a cyber attacker within its jurisdiction.¹⁹⁷ Even if a cyber attack victim captures all the information necessary to conduct a thorough law enforcement investigation, the FBI has bungled such gift-wrapped cyber cases in the past.¹⁹⁸ Just as cyber criminals are capable of seizing money from an individual’s bank accounts,¹⁹⁹ cyber companies with the technical expertise can track down and seize illicit funds, given the proper governmental authorization. A cyber letter of marque would provide such authorization.",
    "## B. Attribution and Self-Defense Attribution is the legal requirement to positively identify the attacker prior to responding with force in self-defense.²⁰⁰ How does a prospective cyber privateer ensure it is striking the proper target²⁰¹ and how does a cyber-privateer cover their tracks so as to not entice further attacks? Admittedly, discovering the source of a cyber attack is “the most important aspect of active defense.”²⁰² It necessarily must be a requirement when issuing a cyber letter of marque to ensure that the privateer is targeting the proper bad actor. Critics have complained that it is too difficult to identify the attacker with sufficient accuracy to ensure a counter-attack is accurately aimed.²⁰³ While tracing an attack may not provide actionable results, and some technologies “limit the ability to make perfect surgical strikes with active defense,”²⁰⁴ the problem may not be as big as it appears. Some speculate that it is more difficult for the bad actor to identify the cyber privateer than it is for the cyber privateer to identify the bad actor.²⁰⁵ The attribution concerns may, however, be a bit overblown.²⁰⁶ Even the Russian cyber attacks launched or encouraged against Estonia could be traced back to the “Russian intelligence apparatus.”²⁰⁷ In fact, “attribution to at least some level will almost always be possible.”²⁰⁸ While the exact technologies available to ensure accurate attribution, which can be done in seconds, are not the focus of this paper, such technology is not new and “is currently the subject of a significant amount of research aimed at improving accuracy and efficiency.”²⁰⁹ While it may not be feasible, or even possible, to accurately attribute 100 million cyber attacks,²¹⁰ “it is clear that the current state of the ¹⁹³ See, e.g., NRC REPORT, supra note 18 (discussing the exemption for lawfully authorized law enforcement and intelligence agencies activities to the CFAA and how government agencies may commandeer private computes or pay for their usage).": "¹⁹⁴ See supra Part I (discussing of the frequency of cyber attacks). The CFAA, in one form or another, has been in effect since 1984. It has had little to no affect on cyber attacks.\n¹⁹⁵ See, e.g., Westby, supra note 147.\n¹⁹⁶ Ms. Westby, while arguing a cyber victim should turn over information to law enforcement instead of proactively defending themselves, admits that “there are too few of them with skills adequate to match the sophisticated nature of today’s cyber criminals.” Id.

Paris Declaration of 1856 Most critics of the letter of marque, regardless of its application, usually point to the Paris Declaration of 1856, noting that the United States is prohibited from employing privateers due to the agreement.²¹² This argument, however, is without merit.\nFirst, the Declaration does not apply to the United States per the plain language of the treaty. “The present Declaration is not and shall not be binding, except between those Powers who have acceded, or shall accede, to it.”²¹³ The United States did not accede to it in 1856 and has not, in the ensuing 157 years, acceded to it. Under the rules of treaty interpretation,²¹⁴ a treaty is binding only upon parties to it,²¹⁵ and it “does not create either obligations or rights for a third State without its consent.”²¹⁶ Further, in order to impose an obligation on a third State, it must “expressly accept that obligation in writing.”²¹⁷ To date, the United States has not consented to the obligations of the Declaration in writing, as required by the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.\nAdditionally, the Declaration clearly pertains, and limits itself, to maritime law.²¹⁸ Since a cyber letter of marque regime is not grounded in maritime law and letters of marque are specifically authorized in the United States Constitution, it is permissible under international law, Paris Declaration notwithstanding, to issue cyber letters of marque.\nOthers argue²¹⁹ that the Declaration has become customary international law.²²⁰ While this might be true at first blush, it ignores the legal and historical fact. A nation, not otherwise bound by a treaty, does not become bound by operation of the rule of customary international law if it has been a persistent objector. In order to be considered a persistent objector, and therefore not bound by a treaty, the State “must have objected to the emergence of a new norm during its formation and continue to object afterwards.”²²¹ Even if it has been state practice to follow the precepts in a treaty, non-signatory states can alter their actions in order to confront new threats.²²² Regarding the Declaration of Paris, the United States objected during the formation of the proposed privateering ban²²³ and objected to the Declaration by passing legislation authorizing privateers during the Civil War;²²⁴ the Spanish government recognized America’s right to issue letters of marque during the Spanish-American War,²²⁵ and voiced opposition at the 1907 Hague Peace Conference.²²⁶ Clearly, the United States has been a persistent objector to the Declaration and thus not bound by it. Simply stated, American privateering declined not because of acquiescence to international treaties which it did not, and had no intent to, sign. Rather, privateering declined because America, after 1898, no longer had a nascent navy, had become a major AUGUST 2013 • THE ARMY LAWYER • DA PAM 27-50-483 naval power,²²⁷ and the “cost-saving advantages of privateering [had] declined.”²²⁸ Assuming, *arguendo*, that the Paris Declaration is customary international law that the United States must follow, the issuance of cyber letters of marque is still not banned. The Declaration never defines privateers.²²⁹ As history demonstrates, a contracted civilian ship can be armed, staffed with civilians, fight, and take prizes—all without violating the Declaration.²³⁰ ## D. The Council of Europe Convention on Cyber-Crime²³¹ On 23 November 2001, the United States signed on to the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime.²³² The Cybercrime Convention came into effect in the United States on 1 January 2007.²³³ The Cybercrime Convention’s main objective “is to pursue a common criminal policy aimed at the protection of society against cyber-crime, especially by adopting appropriate legislation and fostering international co-operation.”²³⁴ It purports to allow countries to work together through substantive, procedural, and jurisdictional laws against a cyber criminal committing crimes in one country while physically located in another.²³⁵ Prior to the Cybercrime Convention (and some would argue even today),²³⁶ the cyber police forces in the United States or internationally did not have the tools or authority necessary to combat cyber-attacks. Additionally, it did not address the cultural issues that may arise from crimes committed in cyberspace.²³⁷ To make matters worse, some countries did not have adequate laws against cyber-crime.²³⁸ An attempt to correct these law enforcement deficiencies was the impetus for the creation of the Cybercrime Convention. It remains the only international treaty attempting to deal with the issue of transcontinental cyber attacks.²³⁹ It fails, however, to effectively protect anyone from cyber attacks. It is largely a symbolic document, serving mainly to reassure the public that governments are doing *something* to address the threat.²⁴⁰ Those reassurances are hollow, as only roughly half of the ratifying states have passed domestic legislation required to enforce the document.²⁴¹ Remarkably, the exceptions contained in the Cybercrime Convention negate its impact. First, no requirement exists that any cyber attacker actually be prosecuted; instead, the State must merely “report the final outcome to the requesting Party [i.e., the cyber victim’s nation] in due course.”²⁴² In addition, nearly every enforcement provision of the Cybercrime Convention contains a legislative flaw, allowing a nation state to refuse to cooperate.²⁴³ A nation may refuse a request for assistance during or after a cyber attack emanating from its country for a host of reasons. These reasons include, but are not limited to²⁴⁴: if a request for assistance would violate domestic laws,²⁴⁵ if a request for assistance and information gained AUGUST 2013 • THE ARMY LAWYER • DA PAM 27-50-483 therefrom could be used in any investigation or court proceedings other than those listed in the request,²⁴⁶ or if an attacked nation believes there are political issues at play.²⁴⁷ Perhaps as a sign of the naïve belief that the feckless Cybercrime Convention will actually curb cyber attacks, the Council of Europe’s Committee of Experts on Terrorism opined in February 2010 that no further conventions are needed to address cyber terrorism because “large scale attacks on computer systems appeared to be already covered by the Cybercrime Convention.”²⁴⁸ Yet two days later, on 18 February 2010, The Washington Post broke the story that more than 75,000 computers and roughly 2,500 companies in the United States, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Turkey, and Mexico were victims of “one of the largest and most sophisticated attacks by cyber criminals discovered to date.”²⁴⁹ The attack began in 2008 and was not discovered until January 2010.²⁵⁰ In the United States, an unnamed Department of Justice official purportedly alleged that the “impact of the convention [is] ‘very positive,’” which, again, seems to ignore the reality of cyber attack’s scope.²⁵¹ To the contrary, the Cybercrime Convention seems to merely limit the ability of a law-abiding entity to take proactive steps necessary to cease a cyber threat.²⁵² Because the Cybercrime Convention does not diminish cyber attacks, lacks any enforcement or prosecution mechanism and expressly states that signatory states pass domestic criminal laws covering “illegal access,”²⁵³ “illegal interception,”²⁵⁴ criminal “misuse of devices,”²⁵⁵ [emphasis added], the United States is not prevented from issuing letters of marque. If Congress exercised its constitutionally authorized power to issue letters of marque, limited to cyber operations, no violation of any provision of the Convention would occur because no domestic criminal acts occur.\nEven the U.S. Attorney General stated, in 2006, that the Cybercrime Convention “is in full accord with all U.S. Constitutional protections.”²⁵⁶ The activity undertaken pursuant to a constitutionally authorized and congressionally endorsed cyber letter of marque would not, under United States law, be illegal and thus not a violation of any provision contained in the Cybercrime Convention. In short, a cyber letter of marque issued by Congress would not violate the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime.",
    "## V. Authorizations and Oversight While a cyber letter of marque is legal, both under domestic and international law, any cyber letter of marque regime must provide for a method of authorizing and subsequently supervising a cyber privateer. This section discusses some potential methods of authorization and oversight necessary for an effective cyber letter of marque regime.": "",
    "## A. Issuance of Bonds and Authorizations Prior to the issuance of a letter of marque, all prospective cyber privateers should be required to register with a central governmental database. This database would provide the supervising agency²⁵⁷ with a means of not only policing cyber privateers and holding them accountable, but also a means for parties allegedly aggrieved by United States authorized cyber privateers to seek redress. Such a database and registration would also allow the supervisory agency an opportunity to vet the putative cyber privateer. “If a company does not have the skills to defend its systems, it likely does not have the skills to attack back—or make AUGUST 2013 • THE ARMY LAWYER • DA PAM 27-50-483 Do we really think that establishing a convention on cyber crime is going to stop our adversaries?

All this does is force offensive cyber forces to establish an unwieldy ‘rules of engagement’ that ties the hands of those who can execute offensive cyber actions.": "Bardin, *supra* note 13.\ndecisions about whether to engage in such actions.”²⁵⁸ If the applicant does not possess the requisite skills, then its request for a cyber letter of marque is denied.²⁵⁹ Further, all applicants must be able to post a bond commensurate with potential liability exposure. “Letters of marque should only be issued to security firms able to post a significant bond and meet specific qualification and training requirements.”²⁶⁰ The bond requirement is the most effective method for screening out “start-ups” and “fly-by-night” security companies from seeking a letter of marque.²⁶¹ The Act Concerning Letters-of-Marque, Prizes &amp; Prize Goods specifically states that before the issuance of any commission of letters of marque, a bond in the amount of five thousand dollars, or ten thousand dollars if the ship had more than one hundred and fifty men, would have to be paid by two “responsible sureties, not interested in such vessel.”²⁶² The payment of such a steep bond ensures that privateers strictly adhere to congressional rules.²⁶³ In a cyber context, since the stakes are so high, a prospective cyber privateer should be required to supply a large monetary bond.²⁶⁴ A large monetary bond would not only ensure that responsible entities apply for and receive cyber letters of marque, but also that those with the requisite discretion and technical expertise are the only ones acting with congressional authority as a cyber privateer. The prime importance of competent exercise of the powers enumerated in the letter of marque is underscored when the vast amount of money and intellectual property lost on a frequent and recurring basis, coupled with the exacting nature of establishing positive identification, especially attribution, is contemplated. A large monetary bond would, in effect, keep the cyber cutthroats out of this business.\nSingapore established CaseTrust, a similar system, in order to protect consumers engaged in e-commerce. CaseTrust receives complaints against e-vendors and legitimizes member companies. Prior to joining, a prospective e-vendor must give a banker’s guarantee, or a bond, to establish that it is indeed a legitimate and reputable company. The CaseTrust system provides for compulsory adjudication including the power to not only fine a vendor, but also to revoke its certification. As a result, the consumer is protected by providing a source of bonded companies and a policing mechanism. Additionally, the commercial entities are shrouded with governmental legitimacy. To date, enforcement has been effective and participation is growing.²⁶⁵ In a historical context, the putative privateer kept detailed daily logs, which were available for inspection by any U.S. naval commander he might encounter.²⁶⁶ Similar requirements would be made of cyber privateers. As all internet activity can be, or actually is, easily monitored,²⁶⁷ this requirement does not place too onerous a burden on the purported cyber privateer. While most private companies are loathe to share details of their cyber activity for fear of losing intellectual property, a competitive edge, or disclose their cyber defenses or weaknesses,²⁶⁸ a company serious about executing a defensive or even offensive cyber letter of marque should be willing to accept the more stringent scrutiny, such as reviewing cyber logbooks.\nA cyber letter of marque would designate the bearers to be licensed combatants for the sovereign, authorizing them to “bear arms” in the cyber sense of the word, and either defend against specific attacks and launch counter attacks (back-backs) or engage in offensive cyber operations directed at sovereign selected targets or networks.²⁶⁹ A private company could be granted authorization to conduct a hack-back, temporarily incapacitating a cyber bad actor, and then notify the appropriate law enforcement or national security entity for final apprehension or network termination.²⁷⁰ AUGUST 2013 • THE ARMY LAWYER • DA PAM 27-50-483 In recognition that cyber privateers would, to a certain extent, be bearing arms, a workable set of rules of engagement would necessarily be a major part of the actual commission. Professor Susan Brenner has expressed concerns that cyber privateers could be motivated to vigilantism and exceed the bounds of their charter, exhibiting an inability to determine who is a just target.²⁷¹ These concerns can be easily alleviated by carefully drafted rules of engagement and scope of authorization in the letter of marque commission itself. If cyber privateers exceed the scope of the commission, they lose their substantial bond, face debarment from future government contracts, and open themselves up to potential criminal prosecutions since their actions were outside the scope of the immunity granted by the letter of marque. These adverse ramifications should keep a vetted and approved cyber privateer in line.",
    "## B. Legal and Judicial Oversight The legal framework for a workable letter of marque regime already exists under current federal law.²⁷² “Privateering worked only because it was backed by a substantial system of law, not only the common law of property, but also the statutory creations such as admiralty courts and bond requirements.”²⁷³ The federal judiciary is vested with original jurisdiction to determine prizes,²⁷⁴ burdens of proof established,²⁷⁵ the due process rights of both the captor and the captive duly considered,²⁷⁶ and the securitylaw.us/2012/11/30/steven-chabinsky-crowdstrike-ex-fbi-cyber-division-talks-pprivate-sector-cyberdeterrence-at-abas-natsec-law-conference/.": "²⁷¹ Brenner, supra note 212.\n²⁷² See, e.g., Commissioning Private Vessels for Seizure of Piratical Vessels, 33 U.S.C. § 386 (2006).\nThe President is authorized to instruct the commanders of the public armed vessels of the United States, and to authorize the commanders of any other armed vessels sailing under the authority of any letters of marquee and reprisal granted by Congress, or the commanders of any other suitable vessels, to subdue, seize, take, and, if on the high seas, to send into any port of the United States, any vessel or boat built, purchased, fitted out, or held as mentions in 33 U.S.C. § 385.\nId.\n²⁷³ Tabarrok, supra note 21, at 572.\n²⁷⁴ Jurisdiction, 10 U.S.C. § 7652 (2006).\n²⁷⁵ See The Resolution, 2 U.S. 19 (U.S. 1781) (holding that the burden of proving a prize was captured lawfully lies with the captors).\n²⁷⁶ The legality of a capture is not determined until a court of competent jurisdiction has issued an order making such a determination.

For example, the court invalidated the first two prizes claimed during the War of 1812 because of improperly issued letters of marque.²⁷⁸ Even the venerable USS Constitution was also involved in an illegitimate capture, a situation embarrassingly rectified by the courts.²⁷⁹ Indeed, a rich legal history of privateering cases exists before the United States Supreme Court.²⁸⁰ Some are concerned that the government would not be able to control the behavior of modern privateers, especially in a cyber context.²⁸¹ In reality, these concerns are easily addressed with stiff consequences.²⁸² Penalties can include forfeiture of the bond and any pay due as a result of a successful capture or mission, seizure of assets,²⁸³ debarment from all future government contracts,²⁸⁴ exclusion from future letter of marque commissions, criminal prosecution, and potential tort liability.²⁸⁵ At least two presidents proposed criminal prosecution for misuse of a letter of marque. President Jefferson, a major proponent of privateering during the Revolutionary War,²⁸⁶ declared that individuals operating off the coast without valid commissions be captured and tried as pirates.²⁸⁷ ²⁷⁷ Duties of United States Attorney, 10 U.S.C.A. § 7656 (2012).\n²⁷⁸ Tabarrok, supra note 21, at 568.\n²⁷⁹ The United States paid the owners of the captured ship $11,000 in damages.

Tort liability has real teeth, as government is generally immune from civil suit, whereas a letter of marque holder would not be. See David A. Sklansky, The Private Police, 46 UCLA L. REV. 1165, 1186 (1999); Richard, supra note 19, at 455.\n²⁸⁶ See supra Part II.\n²⁸⁷ UPTON, supra note 57, at 180.\nAUGUST 2013 • THE ARMY LAWYER • DA PAM 27-50-483 President Lincoln made a similar proclamation regarding privateers hired by the Confederate States, as he did not believe the “rebellious” states had legal authority to issue letters of marque.²⁸⁸ According to some scholars, one of the major drawbacks of the traditional letter of marque system was the lack of organization or unified command, control and communication.²⁸⁹ To address this concern, all cyber letter of marque holders would report their activities and progress to a central authority on a regular and recurring basis.²⁹⁰ This central authority would have the ability to terminate the cyber privateer’s commission and/or refer the matter to the Department of Justice for criminal prosecution, should the commissioner act outside the bounds of authority. As this central authority would have an over-arching view of which cyber privateers were acting in which arenas, they could deconflict any possible issues of interrupting law enforcement, intelligence, or national security operations in cyber space. Additionally, purely governmental agencies, such as the National Security Agency, would then be in a better position to work in concert with the cyber privateers to execute specific targeted operations.²⁹¹ ## VI. Conclusion “More destructive cyber weapons are being created every day... [eventually]... those who mean to harm the United States will gain the ability to launch a damaging attack. The United States must develop stronger defenses before this occurs.”²⁹² Despite this threat, the U.S. government seems to be content with merely allowing network owners to “[sit] there... trying to swat away these intrusions.”²⁹³ Industry experts have specifically asked that Congress “provide opportunities and responsibilities to the private sector to hack back.”²⁹⁴ Perhaps in tacit acknowledgement that the private sector is better prepared to handle cyber issues, the United States Air Force solicits private industry for capabilities designed to “destroy, deny, degrade, disrupt, deceive, corrupt, or usurp the adversaries [sic] ability to use the cyberspace domain for his advantage.”²⁹⁵ Additionally, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DAPRA), through its “Plan X,” sought “innovative research proposals” in an effort to “dominate the cyber battle space.”²⁹⁶ Congress has not only denied these requests, while at the same time ignoring the Air Force and DARPA’s proposed use of private industry, but at the same time tied their hands with respect to possible civil and criminal liability.²⁹⁷ Members of Congress have instead suggested legislative mandates requiring “owners and operators of vital infrastructure [to] better protect networks,” or even tax credits as a means of encouraging corporations to establish stricter cyber security safeguards.²⁹⁸ Congress has failed to provide industry with the tools they are desperately asking for: a means in which to protect themselves in a meaningful way.\nPolitical policy makers must understand that “[i]n cyberspace, the offense has the upper hand” and the nation cannot remain secure while hiding behind a mythical all protective firewall.²⁹⁹ Accordingly, Congress should exercise its constitutional authority and authorize the issuance of cyber letters of marque and allow American entities to actively defend themselves in cyber space.\nAs delineated above, the letter of marque has a rich tradition, not only in international and maritime law, but also in American history. Were it not for this power, the United States might not ever have gained her freedom, much less secured it in the War of 1812.³⁰⁰ The United States justly refused to acquiesce to a ban on privateering and that ban is not binding to this day.³⁰¹ As advanced in this article, a cyber letter of marque can, with adequate safeguards in place,³⁰² protect our current infrastructure, obtain information on emerging threats, and then eliminate such threats. Taking into account the current state of the law and the restrictions that prevent an adequate method of cyber self-defense, it becomes clear that a well thought out cyber letter of marque scheme would be able to address the fears that led to the enactment of the CFAA.\nThe current legal framework allows hackers to do what they please,³⁰³ while network owners must follow onerous statutory rules.³⁰⁴ The issuance of cyber letters of marque is a constitutionally authorized method of self-defense Congress should authorize to level the cyber playing field.\n³⁰⁰ “Historian Faye M. Kert offers the judgment that ‘without the presence of the American privateers in the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812, the United States would never have been able to hold off the British Navy.’” SECHREST, supra note 31, at 7.\n³⁰¹ See infra Part III.\n³⁰² This addresses the emotional and intellectually dishonest reactions of “vigilante justice in cyberspace... notions of pirates on the high seas and wild west posses” as voiced by people such as Jim Richards of Tangent Capital. Egan, supra note 293.\n³⁰³ Some complain that to allow active-defense, cyberspace would devolve into a “wild west.” (“Allowing companies an exception to the CFAA really would turn the Internet into the Wild West.”). Westby, supra note 147.\nIt is in many ways the Wild West. Cyberspace has many similarities to a Wild West world... The message of this metaphor for cyberspace security is clear: If there is no way to enforce law and order throughout all of cyberspace, which appears to be the case, one must rely on local enclaves of law and order, and trusted friends.\nRICHARD O. HUNDLEY &amp; ROBERT H. ANDERSON, EMERGING CHALLENGE SECURITY AND SAFETY IN CYBERSPACE 12, reprinted from IEEE TECHNOLOGY AND SOCIETY MAGAZINE (1995/1996). International scholars have also recognized the Wild West nature of the internet.

Kessinger*\n## I. Introduction\nAt any given time, millions upon millions of people connect to each other via cyberspace. While a convenient method for grandparents to view pictures of their grandchildren, the Internet is also an exceedingly effective vehicle by which to attack a state, a company, or an individual. These attacks occur with frightening frequency, over 1,000 per hour in Great Britain alone; and Britain recognizes the severity of the cyber threat. In the first four days of the November 2012 fighting between Israel and Gaza militants, over 44 million attacks on Israeli websites and an estimated 100 million total attacks occurred. Cyber-attacks cost Australia “an average of $2 million per incident” and exceed a billion dollars per year. Successful attacks also occur against international bodies, such as the International Atomic Energy Agency. These cyber attacks seek not only military targets, but also industrial espionage.\nDespite the frequency and increasing severity of cyber attacks, many governments and industries around the world, to include the United States, are either seemingly helpless against the cyber onslaught, too dysfunctional to create a useful offensive or defensive cyber scheme, or are “highly immature with limited vision and strategic foresight.” Some foreign jurisdictions, our allies in the fight against cyber-attacks, fail to stem the tide of these attacks and now punish the cyber victims.\nThis article explores the improbable, if not politically impossible, application of the letter of marque concept to the cyber arena. Despite the likely political stigma such a proposition would have in today’s Congress, letters of marque are nevertheless a constitutional and valid tool to execute cyber operations, and thus worthy of discussion.\nProposed defenses to cyber attacks are becoming increasingly complex and bizarre.

Militarily, the government retains control over the letter of marque holder (a \"privateer\") and responsibilities as delineated within the express terms of the letter of marque while at the same time broadening the military's reach.$^{19}$ As a law enforcement tool, a letter of marque deputizes an individual or company, thus vesting that entity with police powers. This authority allows the privateer to detain targets, bring them before the sovereign, and receive compensation based on successes, much like a bounty hunter.$^{20}$ Using civilian forces in a military/national defense context is not a concept limited to antiquity. For example, monitored non-governmental civilian participation in governmental operations exists with private military contractors. The United States spent over $300 billion on military contractors from 2001–2007.$^{21}$\nThere is an apparent aversion to the use of letter of marque and privateers.$^{22}$ Various bills introduced throughout\nthe years proposing the revival of letter of marque have stalled or failed outright.$^{23}$ Despite the hesitation, letters of marque and privateers served a legitimate military purpose,$^{24}$ both in supplementing regular combat forces and crippling enemy commerce while protecting American commerce.$^{25}$ A cyber letter of marque would enable a privateer to seize digital assets, disrupt fiscal and communication networks, destroy attacking networks,$^{26}$ and act as a cyber bounty hunter.\nApplying a letter of marque scheme to the cyber world would not only provide authority for American companies to defend themselves from cyber threats, but also allow them to take proactive measures to neutralize a cyber threat before it coalesces into danger. In addition to providing requisite authorization, a letter of marque scheme would regulate the conduct of a prospective cyber privateer and ensure accountability to effect compliance with the letter of marque's mandate.\nPart II of this article examines the historical usage of letters of marque and privateers. A brief historical discussion shows the use of letters of marque in national defense. Such historical perspective provides a useful background when considering their application to cyberspace. Part III applies legal and historical principles to a modern letter of marque regime. In particular, the application of letters of marque within the context of existing technologies and proposed authorization and oversight safeguards are examined. The various laws implicated in a modern cyber letter of marque regime are reviewed in Part IV. Finally, Part V addresses the authorizations and oversight necessary to effectively manage a successful, and lawful, cyber letter of marque regime. While not meant to be an exhaustive analysis of all possible facets related to the implementation of a cyber letter of marque regime, this article shows that despite some initial political and legal issues, using a cyber letter of marque can effectively mitigate the threats posed by cyber attacks.\n## II. History of Letter of Marque and Privateering\nThe concept of allowing private individuals to wage war on a foreign sovereign is not new, nor is it unique to United\nAUGUST 2013 • THE ARMY LAWYER • DA PAM 27-50-483\nStates history. The letter of marque and privateering concepts have been a part of both international law and the accepted norms of warfare for centuries, despite the Declaration of Paris—which purportedly banned privateering. Hugo Grotius, considered by many to be the father of the modern Law of Armed Conflict, noted that letters of marque and reprisal are endorsed by the entirety of the law of nations. Historians credit the expansion and development of the Western world from 1600 to 1815 to privateers.\nThe letter of marque originally served as a “self-help” authorization, allowing a private individual to seek reprisal against a foreigner who caused him harm. Over time, this developed into a government’s authorization to act on its behalf and seize property belonging to an enemy government, usually in the form of ships and cargo. In its most fundamental form, a letter or marque authorized private merchant ships to carry arms in self-defense.\nUpon its founding, due to its small navy, not only did the United States employ letters of marque, but it also was “the world’s biggest proponent of privateering.” The Continental Congress issued many letters of marque, as did individual states. In fact, John Adams reportedly called an early letter of marque scheme, the Massachusetts Armed Vessels Act, “one of the most important documents of the Revolution.”\nThomas Jefferson was also an ardent proponent of privateering: “every possible encouragement should be given to privateering in time of war. . . . Our national ships are too few . . . to . . . retaliate the [sic] acts of the enemy. But by licensing private armed vessels, the whole naval force of the nation is truly brought to bear on the foe.” Jefferson also realized that letters of marque served more than an offensive purpose, detailing how they are also a means of self-defense:\nThe ship Jane is an English merchant vessel . . . employed in the commerce between Jamaica and these States. She brought here a cargo of produce . . . and was to take away . . . flour. Knowing of the war when she left Jamaica, and that our coast was lined with small French privateers, she armed for her defense [sic], and took one of those commissions usually called letters of marque. She arrived here safely . . . Can it be necessary to say that a merchant vessel is not a privateer? That though she has arms to defend herself in time of war, in the course of her regular commerce, this no more makes her a privateer, than a husbandman following his plough in time of war, with a knife or pistol in his pocket, is thereby made a soldier. The occupation of a privateer is attack and plunder, that of a merchant\nAUGUST 2013 • THE ARMY LAWYER • DA PAM 27-50-483\nvessel is commerce and self-preservation.\nSupport for letters of marque by the founding fathers was not merely philosophical consent. Thomas Paine and George Washington both owned stock in privateering ventures. Additionally, Benjamin Franklin practically ran his own privateering operation while he was assigned to France. While most privateering ventures were for money, Franklin used the captured British ships, goods and men to trade for American prisoners of war.\nPrivateering in general weakened an enemy’s economy and its ability to wage war. The American privateers devastated British commerce, funding the first two years of the war substantially through British captures. By early 1777, the British had lost 250 ships, resulting in the collapse of several major London-based West India merchant companies. Within a year, American privateers captured 559 British ships. Of the approximately 796 British ships captured during the Revolutionary War, American privateers and armed merchant ships accounted for roughly 600. British merchants, feeling the crippling effect of American privateers, ensured that “every pressure was brought to bear on Parliament for [the Revolutionary War’s] discontinuance.” Even ships carrying linen from England to Ireland feared the American privateers, to the point of demanding warship escorts.\nAt the outset of the War of 1812, the British Navy consisted of 1,060 warships. In contrast, the United States Navy had only sixteen, including several that were unfit for sea. As a consequence, the United States Navy was not considered to be a serious threat to British naval superiority. In response, Congress passed a statute authorizing the use of privateers, but tightly controlled them. The President could revoke, “at pleasure,” any letters of marque he issued after June 1812. The applicant had to list specific details about the ship, crew, and owners, and “Ample security” submitted to ensure compliance with both international and United States law. Further, and perhaps most relevant to modern application, the ship commanders were required to keep a detailed log of everything “that occurs, daily, and transmit them to the government,” and regular United States Navy commanders had to examine these logbooks when “meeting the privateer at sea.” Failure to abide by these rules would mean forfeiture of the bond and “of all interest in any captures which they may make.”\nWith this new authorization in hand, American privateers wreaked havoc on British shipping and secured victory in America’s second war for independence. In the process, privateers tallied $39 million in prizes, or roughly $672.5 million in 2012 dollars.\nFollowing the War of 1812, letters of marque did not disappear from the American landscape. President Andrew Jackson, in 1834, discussed the use of letters of marque against France. Texas, upon declaring independence from Mexico, realized its coast was vulnerable due to a nascent navy. In response, the fledgling Texas legislature began to issue letters of marque with the intent to “protect the coast, harass Mexican shipping, and bring prizes that could be\n Richard, supra note 19, at 437 (citing Letter from Thomas Jefferson, to Gouverneur Morris (Aug. 16, 1793)), in 3 MEMOIR, CORRESPONDENCE AND MISCELLANIES FROM THE PAPERS OF THOMAS JEFFERSON 275 (1829).\n Tabarrok, supra note 21, at 567.\n Id.; see generally WILLIAM BELL CLARK, BEN FRANKLIN’S PRIVATEERS (1956).\n Tabarrok, supra note 21, at 567.\n CARL E.

In all, Texas issued six letters of marque. Similarly, President Polk recognized the lawful ability of Mexico to issue letters of marque during the Mexican American War.\nIn 1856, Britain, France and other titular world powers met in Paris to discuss concerns arising from wartime maritime law. France and Great Britain sought to end privateering as they could not effectively control the use of privateers by their enemies, i.e., the United States and Russia. Great Britain, in particular, recognized privateering as an effective tool of weaker navies that posed a threat to its naval supremacy and sought to contain it. The result of this meeting was the Paris Declaration of 1856, a document attempting to ban privateering.\nThe Paris Declaration contained three major provisions: the first provided that “[p]rivateering is, and remains, abolished;” the second prevented the seizing of enemy goods on neutral ships; and the third prevented capture of neutral goods on enemy ships. Most importantly, the Declaration went to great pains to ensure that its provisions did not apply to any nation save signatories. This provision is important for two reasons.\nFirst, it made clear that it was not intended to be a universal ban on privateering, as it only applied to signatory nations at war with other signatories. Second, as stated in the document, it did not have the power to police the actions of non-signatories.\nThe United States recognized that this agreement was merely a means for England to maintain maritime supremacy at the expense of nations with a smaller seafaring force, and accordingly, demanded conditions prior to capitulation. The United States agreed to acquiesce and sign the document only if protection of all non-contraband private property from capture at sea was included. The United States reasoned that since all private property is protected on land, “why should it not be [protected] also on the sea?”\nWhile the United States wanted to ensure it would be allowed to trade with both sides of a conflict, free from privateer entanglements, another more vital concern existed. According to Secretary of State William L. Marcy, “the United States could not forgo the right to send out privateers, which in the past had proved her most effective maritime weapon in time of war, and which, since she had no large navy, were essential to her fighting power.” The United States realized that if privateering was banned, its nascent navy would be no match for the greater naval might of countries such as Britain and France. As the plenipotentiaries who signed the Declaration would not adequately address American concerns regarding private goods, and factoring in Marcy’s concern about the resulting unequal balance of naval power, the United States refused to sign the agreement.\nThe issue of privateering arose again in April 1861 when Confederate President Jefferson Davis, with Confederate Congressional approval, issued letters of\n TEXAS PRIVATEERS, https://www.tsl.state.tx.us/exhibits/navy/privateers.html (last modified Aug. 30, 2011).\n Although President Polk did take issue with the blank letters of marque issued by Mexico, arguing those were illegal under international law and those acting in accordance with such letters are considered to be pirates.

The Maritime population of the United States, their enterprising marine, might furnish to Russia the elements of a fleet of privateers, which attached to its service by Letters of Marque and covering the seas with a network would harass and pursue our commerce even in the most remote waters.\nTRAVERS TWISS, BELLIGERENT RIGHT ON THE HIGH SEAS, SINCE THE DECLARATION OF PARIS 10 (1856) (1884).\n Richard, supra note 19, at 428.\n “Privateering is, and remains, abolished. . . .

Perhaps fearing the involvement of the British or French navies in the conflict, the Union declared that it would follow the Declaration and not issue letters of marque and Secretary of State Seward instructed American ambassadors to determine whether the signatories would be amicable to incorporating the proposed changes advocated by Marcy, thus allowing the United States to formally sign the Declaration. As an indication of the Union’s fear of privateers, Secretary Seward authorized acquiescence to the Declaration even if the requested exceptions were not approved. Britain and France declined the advances and the United States remained a non-signatory.\nConsequently, the Union passed a statutory authorization for President Lincoln to issue letters of marque and declared that all attempts to disrupt, capture or destroy Union shipping would be treated as piracy and dealt with as such. Regardless, the British entered the Civil War as privateers, sailing under letters of marque issued by the Confederacy. In fact, in a case brought by the United States against Britain for damages caused by a privateer, an international tribunal found no issue with a non-signatory (the Confederacy) issuing letters of marque to a signatory (Britain) “to construct, furnish, and crew ships to be used in commerce raids against a non-signatory, the United States.”\nWhen the United States entered into conflict with the Spanish during the Spanish American War, neither the United States nor Spain was a signatory to the Declaration of Paris. Not only did Spain specifically reserve the right to issue letters of marque, the Spanish government recognized\nAmerica’s right and ability to issue the same. The Spanish never carried out the threat, and President McKinley, for the first time, articulated a U.S. intention to comply with the Paris Declaration, though still not be a signatory.\nDespite the reluctance, both Spain and the United States found ways to unofficially authorize privateers without formally issuing letters of marque. Both nations organized “auxiliary cruisers of the Navy.” The United States Navy chartered private merchant ships, heavily armed them, and subsequently entered into naval service. The Navy used the ships and manned them with the owner’s regular, ostensibly civilian crew, placing the ships “under the entire control of the senior naval officer on board.” One such ship, the City of Paris, actually took prizes, with the United States Prize Court holding that she was not a “vessel of the Navy nor a privateer . . . ” and finally ruling that she was an “armed vessel in the service of the United States” and the civilian crew was “entitled as of right to share in the prize money.”\nWhile the nature of privateering changed with the Spanish-American War, privateering did not disappear. At the 1907 Hague Peace Conference, the United States again voiced its opposition to the privateering prohibition. Specifically, the United States voiced the same concerns as\n ADAMS, supra note 72, at 141; JAMES D.

Applying Letters of Marque to Cyber Warfare\nLetters of marque were the original “self-help” governmental authorization. While used to great effect in the past, they can now be resurrected and used to achieve similar results, especially in a cyber context. This section addresses the use of a cyber letter of marque in three areas: seizing assets; disrupting, disabling, and dismantling adversarial networks; and conducting cyber bounty hunting and rewards programs.\n## A. Seizing Assets\nIn a modern cyber letter of marque scheme, the U.S. government would authorize certain companies or individuals to track, freeze, and seize the illicit funds of designated criminal organizations. The net effect would be cutting off supplies to deliver the United States from its enemies. For example, the United States has recently named several Russians as “transnational criminals” and promulgated an Executive Order that authorizes “seizure of their assets in the United States and prevents them from banking in dollars anywhere in the world.”\nWhen rogue states, such as Iran, contravene the will of the international community, the most used method of ensuring compliance is via the United Nations Security Council or unilateral economic sanctions. The United States first instituted sanctions against Iran in 1979, following the seizure of the American Embassy during the Iranian Revolution. These sanctions included freezing roughly $11 billion in Iranian assets. Iran continues to launder and hide money in contravention of these resolutions, often with the help of international banks. In just one instance, the illicit transactions totaled $250 billion. Iran has also turned to China, specifically its banking system, for help in escaping economic sanctions. Illicit money laundering in contravention of United Nations resolutions is not limited to Iran, but has also included North Korea, Cuba, Sudan, and Mexican criminal cartels.\n See supra Part II.\n CHOATE, supra note 98, at 40.\n Id.\n Some have alleged that blimps operated on the west coast of the United States during World War II pursuant to letters of marque. “The Los Angeles based Resolute was the only airship . . . operated for the Navy under privateer status. . . .” JAMES SHOCK &amp; DAVID SMITH, THE GOODYEAR AIRSHIPS 43 (2002).

A cyber letter of marque would allow a privateer to seek these illicit funds wherever they may be hidden and either seize them or digitally sequester them for further law enforcement action. Such a cyber letter of marque brings to bear a formidable resource that will increase the likelihood for seizure of illicit funds and the shutdown of avenues for illicit funding.\nThe idea of using a letter of marque to effect an economic result is not novel. John Adams, in singing the virtues of privateering, said “[I]t is by cutting off supplies, not by attacks, sieges, or assaults, that I expect deliverance from enemies.”[119] While letters of marque during the\nRevolutionary War and the War of 1812 had distinct military objectives, they were \"also a means of commercial warfare conducted for profit.\"[120] Privateers \"were engaged not in patriotic, but business ventures.\"[121] Some privateers amassed great fortunes through their letter of marque commissions,[122] with even the common seaman receiving up to one thousand dollars above his regular wage from just one voyage.[123] The proceeds from captured enemy goods, once sold via the Unites States Prize Courts, were split between the privateer and the sovereign, thus providing a much needed injection of funds to the government and the privateer, while at the same time depriving the enemy of resources.[124]\nMotivated by the possibility of retaining a healthy percentage of the roughly $1.6 trillion presently illicitly laundered worldwide, the number of prospective cyber privateers would be legion. Consequently, the United States government would be in a position to demand an exorbitantly high bond, thus guaranteeing that only the most technically proficient and responsible cyber privateers would seek the commission. As for the cyber profiteer, the prospect of sharing a large percentage of the trillions of dollars, not to mention the potential for criminal or tort liability,[125] would ensure strict compliance with the terms of the letter of marque. As the privateer in the 1700s and 1800s provided both a much needed governmental funding stream[126] and served a valid national security function, so too would a modern cyber privateer by removing illicit funds from the hands of organized crime and sanction violators. The end result would be a potential death blow to crime organizations and rogue regimes.\nCurrently, the law restricts anyone from attempting to seize assets, whether they belong to the most deplorable rogue regime or the most vicious drug cartel. A cyber letter of marque would vest responsible and vetted entities with authority to digitally seize illicit funds while providing legal protections from criminal and/or civil liability. Current laws restricting attempted seizures would remain in place for those acting without a valid letter of marque or those\nAUGUST 2013 • THE ARMY LAWYER • DA PAM 27-50-483\noperating outside the scope of their letter of marque commissions.\n## B. Disrupting, Disabling, and Dismantling Adversarial Networks\nIn December 2012, a cybercriminal known as “vorVzakone” announced Project Blitzkrieg, wherein he planned to attack 30 Unites States banks in an attempt to steal money from accounts belonging to the “rich.” McAfee Labs, a leading computer security company, determined that this “is a credible threat to the financial industry and appears to be moving forward as planned.” The projected losses from the announced attack could reach “hundreds of millions of dollars.” The targets of the planned attack included Bank of America, Capitol One, Suntrust, Ameritrade, eTrade, and Fidelity and Schwab. From April to December 2012, vorVzakone claimed at least 500 cyber victims.\nAt roughly the same time that the U.S. banking industry began to deal with vorVzakone, bank officials were contending with cyber attacks emanating from Iran. The attack’s complexities are comparable to that of “a pack of fire-breathing Godzillas.” In fact, the internet traffic used in the attacks has been “multiple times” the number that Russia allegedly directed or encouraged at Estonia in a month-long online assault in 2007 that nearly crippled the\n Literally translated means “thief in law.” See KREBS ON SECURITY, New Findings Lend Credence to Project Blitzkrieg, http://krebsonsecurity.com/tag/vorvzakone-gozi-prinimalku/ (last visited Dec. 12, 2012).\n While the exact identity of vorKzakone is unknown, he is believed to be a male, as shown by alleged photographs of vorKzakone online.

These attacks continue because, in part, there is no disincentive for the bad actors, as they know nothing will happen to them. However, if the United States authorized tightly controlled offensive cyber capabilities via a congressionally authorized cyber letter of marque, the nation could allow a U.S. cyber entity to neutralize the attacker and their capabilities. As a direct consequence, the attacks will most likely cease and the attackers will move to easier targets. In essence, a cyber letter of marque would “arm” U.S. entities, thus allowing them to protect themselves in much the same way the historical letters of marque allowed merchant ships to arm themselves for self-defense purposes.\nAs with seizure of assets, ample historical support exists for the use of privateering in the disruption of enemy activity. As discussed previously, American privateers disrupted English commerce to such an extent that several London-based firms went bankrupt. British merchants,\ntheir livelihoods so disrupted and, in fact, disabled, put pressure on their own government to end the war and allow the Americans to have their independence. The financial toll on the enemy during the War of 1812 by American privateers was staggering, which in turn had the operative effect of weakening both British naval superiority and morale in England. If privateering proved to be such an effective defensive weapon in a naval context, it can certainly be used in a cyber context where disrupting an enemy’s attack can be done through a keyboard by a handful of individuals instead of through fourteen-gun warships manned by over a hundred crewmen.\n## C. Cyber Bounty Hunting\nThe realm of cyber letters of marque is not limited to offensive or defensive actions in the classic sense. A cyber letter of marque could also be utilized as a method of bounty hunting, providing information to law enforcement agencies necessary to apprehend a cyber attacker.\nBounty hunting, like a letter of marque, is an activity intertwined with the history of the United States. The United States Supreme Court endorsed bounty hunting as a legal activity in the 1872 case *Taylor v. Taintor*. The federal government endorsed, and continues to endorse, bounty hunting for capture (as opposed to kill) as exemplified in the most wanted lists.

This, arguably, would be illegal under current United States law.\nThe Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) serves as a barrier to a corporation or individual from coming to the aid of a cyber-attack victim. Congress could carefully draft cyber letter of marquee legislation authorizing such entities to track and digitally “capture” a cyber criminal or terrorist. The only difference between the reward/bounty programs currently operated by the United States Government and a cyber letter of marque is the antiquated CFAA prohibition.\nIndeed, other scholars have posited the use of bounty hunting letters of marque. For example, Robert P. DeWitte, writing in the Indiana Law Journal, discussed one of the potential downfalls between physical, as opposed to virtual, bounty hunting through the use of a letter of marque. In particular, he illuminated the legitimate concern that “state authorities could conceivably attempt to capture and/or kill privateers” in their territory while operating under a valid U.S. letter of marque. However, this concern in a cyber letter of marque context is not applicable since the cyber privateer/bounty hunter would be safely ensconced in the territorial United States, outside the physical reach of an unfriendly foreign armed force.\nJust as letters of marque are constitutional, so too are bounties, as over a hundred years of U.S. jurisprudence demonstrates. The issuance of a cyber letter of marque\n See, e.g., NAT’L ASS’N FUGITIVE RECOVERY AGENTS (N.A.F.R.A.), http://fugitive-recovery.org/ (last visited Dec. 24, 2012); NAT’L ASS’N BAIL BOND INVESTIGATORS, http://nabbi.org/ (last visited Dec. 24, 2012).\n The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1030 (2006), would most likely prevent a company or individual from taking these steps.

A cyber letter of marque would allow a cyber privateer access to those established and protected legal mechanisms.\n## IV. Legal Barriers\nDespite the many potential applications of a cyber letter of marque, some arguments raise concerns about the legality of its application. When discussing letters of marque, most commentators cite to the same alleged legal barriers to implementation: domestic law, usually the CFAA; the Law of Armed Conflict, specifically attribution and self-defense concerns; the Paris Declaration of 1856; and the Council of Europe Convention on Cyber-crime. This section examines each of these areas and analyzes why they are not legal barriers to the implementation of a cyber letter of marque regime.\n### A. The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act\nThe Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, initially a criminal statute protecting government computers and those computers belonging to entities with compelling government interests, forces companies under attack to “just stand and take a beating.” Since its passage in 1984, it has expanded to include civil liability by prohibiting anyone from “intentionally access[ing] a protected computer without authorization or exceed[ing] authorized access . . . [and recklessly causing damage involving a loss of] at least\n$5,000 in value.” The definition of a “protected computer” has expanded to cover not only U.S. government computers, but also any computer “used in a manner that affects interstate or foreign commerce.” Even those computers located outside the United States are protected. Potentially, every single computer connected to the internet anywhere in the world would be a “protected computer” pursuant to the CFAA, including, potentially, a blue-tooth-enabled garage door opener or coffeemaker in suburbia.\nWhile the CFAA prohibits the mere access to a protected computer, causing damage seems to be the lynchpin to triggering civil and criminal penalties under the CFAA. Some courts have homed in on the damage requirement, refusing to find civil or criminal liability. For example, in *Moulton v. VC3*, the court held that an unauthorized port scan and throughput test of a defendant’s servers is not a violation of the CFAA since no “damage” was caused. Likewise, in *United States v. Czubinski*, the court reversed the criminal conviction of an IRS agent who accessed a “protected computer” to satisfy his curiosity.\nWhile some of the judicial decisions seem to allow some degree of cyber intelligence collection under the current regulatory scheme, the courts clearly would not allow an entity to seize assets, whether they are being laundered at a major international bank or if information leading to their location is on a drug kingpin’s desktop\n\n This included not only government computers and networks, but also those of large banks, the New York Stock Exchange, etc. Robert B.

Consequently, government authorization would first be a necessity.\nDespite allowing for criminal and civil penalties, the CFAA is not an effective means of preventing cyber attacks. Some have argued that active-defense authorizations, such as a letter of marque, are not necessary as the cyber victim can turn over evidence of a cyber attack to the FBI for prosecution. While this might work in theory, in actual practice it leaves the cyber victim virtually remediless for a host of reasons. For one, law enforcement personnel are questionably competent when it comes to cyber attacks and cyber crime. Further, due to the global nature of cyber attacks, an American court might have a difficult time bringing a cyber attacker within its jurisdiction. Even if a cyber attack victim captures all the information necessary to conduct a thorough law enforcement investigation, the FBI has bungled such gift-wrapped cyber cases in the past.\nJust as cyber criminals are capable of seizing money from an individual’s bank accounts, cyber companies with the technical expertise can track down and seize illicit funds, given the proper governmental authorization. A cyber letter of marque would provide such authorization.\n## B. Attribution and Self-Defense\nAttribution is the legal requirement to positively identify the attacker prior to responding with force in self-defense. How does a prospective cyber privateer ensure it is striking the proper target and how does a cyber-privateer cover their tracks so as to not entice further attacks? Admittedly, discovering the source of a cyber attack is “the most important aspect of active defense.” It necessarily must be a requirement when issuing a cyber letter of marque to ensure that the privateer is targeting the proper bad actor. Critics have complained that it is too difficult to identify the attacker with sufficient accuracy to ensure a counter-attack is accurately aimed. While tracing an attack may not provide actionable results, and some technologies “limit the ability to make perfect surgical strikes with active defense,” the problem may not be as big as it appears. Some speculate that it is more difficult for the bad actor to identify the cyber privateer than it is for the cyber privateer to identify the bad actor.\nThe attribution concerns may, however, be a bit overblown. Even the Russian cyber attacks launched or encouraged against Estonia could be traced back to the “Russian intelligence apparatus.” In fact, “attribution to at least some level will almost always be possible.” While the exact technologies available to ensure accurate attribution, which can be done in seconds, are not the focus of this paper, such technology is not new and “is currently the subject of a significant amount of research aimed at improving accuracy and efficiency.” While it may not be feasible, or even possible, to accurately attribute 100 million cyber attacks, “it is clear that the current state of the\n See, e.g., NRC REPORT, supra note 18 (discussing the exemption for lawfully authorized law enforcement and intelligence agencies activities to the CFAA and how government agencies may commandeer private computes or pay for their usage).\n See supra Part I (discussing of the frequency of cyber attacks). The CFAA, in one form or another, has been in effect since 1984. It has had little to no affect on cyber attacks.\n See, e.g., Westby, supra note 147.\n Ms. Westby, while arguing a cyber victim should turn over information to law enforcement instead of proactively defending themselves, admits that “there are too few of them with skills adequate to match the sophisticated nature of today’s cyber criminals.” Id. Others have agreed with her assessment that there are too few cyber-competent law enforcement officers.

Paris Declaration of 1856\nMost critics of the letter of marque, regardless of its application, usually point to the Paris Declaration of 1856, noting that the United States is prohibited from employing privateers due to the agreement. This argument, however, is without merit.\nFirst, the Declaration does not apply to the United States per the plain language of the treaty. “The present Declaration is not and shall not be binding, except between those Powers who have acceded, or shall accede, to it.” The United States did not accede to it in 1856 and has not, in the ensuing 157 years, acceded to it. Under the rules of treaty interpretation, a treaty is binding only upon parties to it, and it “does not create either obligations or rights for a third State without its consent.” Further, in order to impose an obligation on a third State, it must “expressly accept that obligation in writing.” To date, the United States has not consented to the obligations of the Declaration in writing, as required by the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.\nAdditionally, the Declaration clearly pertains, and limits itself, to maritime law. Since a cyber letter of marque regime is not grounded in maritime law and letters of marque are specifically authorized in the United States Constitution, it is permissible under international law, Paris Declaration notwithstanding, to issue cyber letters of marque.\nOthers argue that the Declaration has become customary international law. While this might be true at first blush, it ignores the legal and historical fact. A nation, not otherwise bound by a treaty, does not become bound by operation of the rule of customary international law if it has been a persistent objector. In order to be considered a persistent objector, and therefore not bound by a treaty, the State “must have objected to the emergence of a new norm during its formation and continue to object afterwards.” Even if it has been state practice to follow the precepts in a treaty, non-signatory states can alter their actions in order to confront new threats.\nRegarding the Declaration of Paris, the United States objected during the formation of the proposed privateering ban and objected to the Declaration by passing legislation authorizing privateers during the Civil War; the Spanish government recognized America’s right to issue letters of marque during the Spanish-American War, and voiced opposition at the 1907 Hague Peace Conference. Clearly, the United States has been a persistent objector to the Declaration and thus not bound by it. Simply stated, American privateering declined not because of acquiescence to international treaties which it did not, and had no intent to, sign. Rather, privateering declined because America, after 1898, no longer had a nascent navy, had become a major\nAUGUST 2013 • THE ARMY LAWYER • DA PAM 27-50-483\nnaval power, and the “cost-saving advantages of privateering [had] declined.”\nAssuming, *arguendo*, that the Paris Declaration is customary international law that the United States must follow, the issuance of cyber letters of marque is still not banned. The Declaration never defines privateers. As history demonstrates, a contracted civilian ship can be armed, staffed with civilians, fight, and take prizes—all without violating the Declaration.\n## D. The Council of Europe Convention on Cyber-Crime\nOn 23 November 2001, the United States signed on to the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime. The Cybercrime Convention came into effect in the United States on 1 January 2007. The Cybercrime Convention’s main objective “is to pursue a common criminal policy aimed at the protection of society against cyber-crime, especially by adopting appropriate legislation and fostering international co-operation.” It purports to allow countries to work together through substantive, procedural, and jurisdictional laws against a cyber criminal committing crimes in one country while physically located in another. Prior to the Cybercrime Convention (and some would argue even today), the cyber police forces in the United States or internationally did not have the tools or authority necessary to combat cyber-attacks. Additionally, it did not address the\ncultural issues that may arise from crimes committed in cyberspace. To make matters worse, some countries did not have adequate laws against cyber-crime.\nAn attempt to correct these law enforcement deficiencies was the impetus for the creation of the Cybercrime Convention. It remains the only international treaty attempting to deal with the issue of transcontinental cyber attacks. It fails, however, to effectively protect anyone from cyber attacks. It is largely a symbolic document, serving mainly to reassure the public that governments are doing *something* to address the threat. Those reassurances are hollow, as only roughly half of the ratifying states have passed domestic legislation required to enforce the document.\nRemarkably, the exceptions contained in the Cybercrime Convention negate its impact. First, no requirement exists that any cyber attacker actually be prosecuted; instead, the State must merely “report the final outcome to the requesting Party [i.e., the cyber victim’s nation] in due course.” In addition, nearly every enforcement provision of the Cybercrime Convention contains a legislative flaw, allowing a nation state to refuse to cooperate. A nation may refuse a request for assistance during or after a cyber attack emanating from its country for a host of reasons. These reasons include, but are not limited to: if a request for assistance would violate domestic laws, if a request for assistance and information gained\nAUGUST 2013 • THE ARMY LAWYER • DA PAM 27-50-483\ntherefrom could be used in any investigation or court proceedings other than those listed in the request, or if an attacked nation believes there are political issues at play.\nPerhaps as a sign of the naïve belief that the feckless Cybercrime Convention will actually curb cyber attacks, the Council of Europe’s Committee of Experts on Terrorism opined in February 2010 that no further conventions are needed to address cyber terrorism because “large scale attacks on computer systems appeared to be already covered by the Cybercrime Convention.” Yet two days later, on 18 February 2010, The Washington Post broke the story that more than 75,000 computers and roughly 2,500 companies in the United States, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Turkey, and Mexico were victims of “one of the largest and most sophisticated attacks by cyber criminals discovered to date.” The attack began in 2008 and was not discovered until January 2010.\nIn the United States, an unnamed Department of Justice official purportedly alleged that the “impact of the convention [is] ‘very positive,’” which, again, seems to ignore the reality of cyber attack’s scope. To the contrary, the Cybercrime Convention seems to merely limit the ability of a law-abiding entity to take proactive steps necessary to cease a cyber threat.\nBecause the Cybercrime Convention does not diminish cyber attacks, lacks any enforcement or prosecution mechanism and expressly states that signatory states pass domestic criminal laws covering “illegal access,” “illegal interception,” criminal “misuse of devices,” [emphasis added], the United States is not prevented from issuing letters of marque. If Congress exercised its constitutionally authorized power to issue letters of marque, limited to cyber operations, no violation of any provision of the Convention would occur because no domestic criminal acts occur.\nEven the U.S. Attorney General stated, in 2006, that the Cybercrime Convention “is in full accord with all U.S. Constitutional protections.” The activity undertaken pursuant to a constitutionally authorized and congressionally endorsed cyber letter of marque would not, under United States law, be illegal and thus not a violation of any provision contained in the Cybercrime Convention. In short, a cyber letter of marque issued by Congress would not violate the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime.\n## V. Authorizations and Oversight\nWhile a cyber letter of marque is legal, both under domestic and international law, any cyber letter of marque regime must provide for a method of authorizing and subsequently supervising a cyber privateer. This section discusses some potential methods of authorization and oversight necessary for an effective cyber letter of marque regime.\n## A. Issuance of Bonds and Authorizations\nPrior to the issuance of a letter of marque, all prospective cyber privateers should be required to register with a central governmental database. This database would provide the supervising agency with a means of not only policing cyber privateers and holding them accountable, but also a means for parties allegedly aggrieved by United States authorized cyber privateers to seek redress. Such a database and registration would also allow the supervisory agency an opportunity to vet the putative cyber privateer. “If a company does not have the skills to defend its systems, it likely does not have the skills to attack back—or make\nAUGUST 2013 • THE ARMY LAWYER • DA PAM 27-50-483\n\nDo we really think that establishing a convention on cyber crime is going to stop our adversaries? They do not recognize our virtual boards or virtual sovereignty as it is. Why would they recognize a convention on cyber crime? All this does is force offensive cyber forces to establish an unwieldy ‘rules of engagement’ that ties the hands of those who can execute offensive cyber actions.\nBardin, *supra* note 13.\n\ndecisions about whether to engage in such actions.” If the applicant does not possess the requisite skills, then its request for a cyber letter of marque is denied.\nFurther, all applicants must be able to post a bond commensurate with potential liability exposure. “Letters of marque should only be issued to security firms able to post a significant bond and meet specific qualification and training requirements.” The bond requirement is the most effective method for screening out “start-ups” and “fly-by-night” security companies from seeking a letter of marque. The Act Concerning Letters-of-Marque, Prizes &amp; Prize Goods specifically states that before the issuance of any commission of letters of marque, a bond in the amount of five thousand dollars, or ten thousand dollars if the ship had more than one hundred and fifty men, would have to be paid by two “responsible sureties, not interested in such vessel.” The payment of such a steep bond ensures that privateers strictly adhere to congressional rules.\nIn a cyber context, since the stakes are so high, a prospective cyber privateer should be required to supply a large monetary bond. A large monetary bond would not only ensure that responsible entities apply for and receive cyber letters of marque, but also that those with the requisite discretion and technical expertise are the only ones acting with congressional authority as a cyber privateer. The prime importance of competent exercise of the powers enumerated in the letter of marque is underscored when the vast amount of money and intellectual property lost on a frequent and recurring basis, coupled with the exacting nature of establishing positive identification, especially attribution, is contemplated. A large monetary bond would, in effect, keep the cyber cutthroats out of this business.\nSingapore established CaseTrust, a similar system, in order to protect consumers engaged in e-commerce. CaseTrust receives complaints against e-vendors and legitimizes member companies. Prior to joining, a\nprospective e-vendor must give a banker’s guarantee, or a bond, to establish that it is indeed a legitimate and reputable company. The CaseTrust system provides for compulsory adjudication including the power to not only fine a vendor, but also to revoke its certification. As a result, the consumer is protected by providing a source of bonded companies and a policing mechanism. Additionally, the commercial entities are shrouded with governmental legitimacy. To date, enforcement has been effective and participation is growing.\nIn a historical context, the putative privateer kept detailed daily logs, which were available for inspection by any U.S. naval commander he might encounter. Similar requirements would be made of cyber privateers. As all internet activity can be, or actually is, easily monitored, this requirement does not place too onerous a burden on the purported cyber privateer. While most private companies are loathe to share details of their cyber activity for fear of losing intellectual property, a competitive edge, or disclose their cyber defenses or weaknesses, a company serious about executing a defensive or even offensive cyber letter of marque should be willing to accept the more stringent scrutiny, such as reviewing cyber logbooks.\nA cyber letter of marque would designate the bearers to be licensed combatants for the sovereign, authorizing them to “bear arms” in the cyber sense of the word, and either defend against specific attacks and launch counter attacks (back-backs) or engage in offensive cyber operations directed at sovereign selected targets or networks. A private company could be granted authorization to conduct a hack-back, temporarily incapacitating a cyber bad actor, and then notify the appropriate law enforcement or national security entity for final apprehension or network termination.\nAUGUST 2013 • THE ARMY LAWYER • DA PAM 27-50-483\nIn recognition that cyber privateers would, to a certain extent, be bearing arms, a workable set of rules of engagement would necessarily be a major part of the actual commission. Professor Susan Brenner has expressed concerns that cyber privateers could be motivated to vigilantism and exceed the bounds of their charter, exhibiting an inability to determine who is a just target. These concerns can be easily alleviated by carefully drafted rules of engagement and scope of authorization in the letter of marque commission itself. If cyber privateers exceed the scope of the commission, they lose their substantial bond, face debarment from future government contracts, and open themselves up to potential criminal prosecutions since their actions were outside the scope of the immunity granted by the letter of marque. These adverse ramifications should keep a vetted and approved cyber privateer in line.\n## B. Legal and Judicial Oversight\nThe legal framework for a workable letter of marque regime already exists under current federal law. “Privateering worked only because it was backed by a substantial system of law, not only the common law of property, but also the statutory creations such as admiralty courts and bond requirements.” The federal judiciary is vested with original jurisdiction to determine prizes, burdens of proof established, the due process rights of both the captor and the captive duly considered, and the\nsecuritylaw.us/2012/11/30/steven-chabinsky-crowdstrike-ex-fbi-cyber-division-talks-pprivate-sector-cyberdeterrence-at-abas-natsec-law-conference/.\n Brenner, supra note 212.\n See, e.g., Commissioning Private Vessels for Seizure of Piratical Vessels, 33 U.S.C. § 386 (2006).\nThe President is authorized to instruct the commanders of the public armed vessels of the United States, and to authorize the commanders of any other armed vessels sailing under the authority of any letters of marquee and reprisal granted by Congress, or the commanders of any other suitable vessels, to subdue, seize, take, and, if on the high seas, to send into any port of the United States, any vessel or boat built, purchased, fitted out, or held as mentions in 33 U.S.C. § 385.\nId.\n Tabarrok, supra note 21, at 572.\n Jurisdiction, 10 U.S.C. § 7652 (2006).\n See The Resolution, 2 U.S. 19 (U.S. 1781) (holding that the burden of proving a prize was captured lawfully lies with the captors).\n The legality of a capture is not determined until a court of competent jurisdiction has issued an order making such a determination. Id. Whether property seized may be confiscated as a prize is a judicial question and each case is to be decided on its own facts. Property Captured by the Potomac Flotilla, 10 Op. Att’y Gen. 467 (1863).\ninterests of the United States represented by a duly appointed authority in the “United States attorney for the district in which the prize cause is adjudicated.” In fact, Chapter 655 of 10 U.S.C. contains the entire statutory framework to judicially administer a letter of marque regime.\nHistorical precedence demonstrates that judicial oversight is an effective means to monitor and police privateers. For example, the court invalidated the first two prizes claimed during the War of 1812 because of improperly issued letters of marque. Even the venerable USS Constitution was also involved in an illegitimate capture, a situation embarrassingly rectified by the courts. Indeed, a rich legal history of privateering cases exists before the United States Supreme Court.\nSome are concerned that the government would not be able to control the behavior of modern privateers, especially in a cyber context. In reality, these concerns are easily addressed with stiff consequences. Penalties can include forfeiture of the bond and any pay due as a result of a successful capture or mission, seizure of assets, debarment from all future government contracts, exclusion from future letter of marque commissions, criminal prosecution, and potential tort liability.\nAt least two presidents proposed criminal prosecution for misuse of a letter of marque. President Jefferson, a major proponent of privateering during the Revolutionary War, declared that individuals operating off the coast without valid commissions be captured and tried as pirates.\n Duties of United States Attorney, 10 U.S.C.A. § 7656 (2012).\n Tabarrok, supra note 21, at 568.\n The United States paid the owners of the captured ship $11,000 in damages. PETRIE, supra note 122, at 160.\n See, e.g., In re The Amiable Isabella, Munos, 19 U.S. 1 (1821); The Adeline, 9 Cranch 244 (1815); The Amy Warwick, 67 U.S. 635 (1862).\n Brenner, supra note 212.\n Richard, supra note 19, at 455.\n In a cyber context, this could include all computers and network capabilities.\n\n See The Santissima Trinidad, 20 U.S. 283 (1822) (holding that illegal privateers, whether public or private, “are tortuous—and the original owner is entitled to restitution when brought within our jurisdiction”). Tort liability has real teeth, as government is generally immune from civil suit, whereas a letter of marque holder would not be. See David A. Sklansky, The Private Police, 46 UCLA L. REV. 1165, 1186 (1999); Richard, supra note 19, at 455.\n See supra Part II.\n UPTON, supra note 57, at 180.\nAUGUST 2013 • THE ARMY LAWYER • DA PAM 27-50-483\nPresident Lincoln made a similar proclamation regarding privateers hired by the Confederate States, as he did not believe the “rebellious” states had legal authority to issue letters of marque.\nAccording to some scholars, one of the major drawbacks of the traditional letter of marque system was the lack of organization or unified command, control and communication. To address this concern, all cyber letter of marque holders would report their activities and progress to a central authority on a regular and recurring basis. This central authority would have the ability to terminate the cyber privateer’s commission and/or refer the matter to the Department of Justice for criminal prosecution, should the commissioner act outside the bounds of authority. As this central authority would have an over-arching view of which cyber privateers were acting in which arenas, they could deconflict any possible issues of interrupting law enforcement, intelligence, or national security operations in cyber space. Additionally, purely governmental agencies, such as the National Security Agency, would then be in a better position to work in concert with the cyber privateers to execute specific targeted operations.\n## VI. Conclusion\n“More destructive cyber weapons are being created every day . . . [eventually] . . . those who mean to harm the United States will gain the ability to launch a damaging attack. The United States must develop stronger defenses before this occurs.” Despite this threat, the U.S. government seems to be content with merely allowing network owners to “[sit] there . . . trying to swat away these intrusions.” Industry experts have specifically asked that Congress “provide opportunities and responsibilities to the private sector to hack back.”\nPerhaps in tacit acknowledgement that the private sector is better prepared to handle cyber issues, the United States Air Force solicits private industry for capabilities designed to “destroy, deny, degrade, disrupt, deceive, corrupt, or usurp the adversaries [sic] ability to use the cyberspace domain for his advantage.”\nAdditionally, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DAPRA), through its “Plan X,” sought “innovative research proposals” in an effort to “dominate the cyber battle space.” Congress has not only denied these requests, while at the same time ignoring the Air Force and DARPA’s proposed use of private industry, but at the same time tied their hands with respect to possible civil and criminal liability. Members of Congress have instead suggested legislative mandates requiring “owners and operators of vital infrastructure [to] better protect networks,” or even tax credits as a means of encouraging corporations to establish stricter cyber security safeguards. Congress has failed to provide industry with the tools they are desperately asking for: a means in which to protect themselves in a meaningful way.\nPolitical policy makers must understand that “[i]n cyberspace, the offense has the upper hand” and the nation cannot remain secure while hiding behind a mythical all protective firewall. Accordingly, Congress should exercise its constitutional authority and authorize the\n\nissuance of cyber letters of marque and allow American entities to actively defend themselves in cyber space.\nAs delineated above, the letter of marque has a rich tradition, not only in international and maritime law, but also in American history. Were it not for this power, the United States might not ever have gained her freedom, much less secured it in the War of 1812. The United States justly refused to acquiesce to a ban on privateering and that ban is not binding to this day. As advanced in this article, a cyber letter of marque can, with adequate safeguards in place, protect our current infrastructure, obtain information on emerging threats, and then eliminate such threats. Taking into account the current state of the law and\nthe restrictions that prevent an adequate method of cyber self-defense, it becomes clear that a well thought out cyber letter of marque scheme would be able to address the fears that led to the enactment of the CFAA.\nThe current legal framework allows hackers to do what they please, while network owners must follow onerous statutory rules. The issuance of cyber letters of marque is a constitutionally authorized method of self-defense Congress should authorize to level the cyber playing field.\n “Historian Faye M. Kert offers the judgment that ‘without the presence of the American privateers in the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812, the United States would never have been able to hold off the British Navy.’” SECHREST, supra note 31, at 7.\n See infra Part III.\n This addresses the emotional and intellectually dishonest reactions of “vigilante justice in cyberspace . . . notions of pirates on the high seas and wild west posses” as voiced by people such as Jim Richards of Tangent Capital. Egan, supra note 293.\n Some complain that to allow active-defense, cyberspace would devolve into a “wild west.” (“Allowing companies an exception to the CFAA really would turn the Internet into the Wild West.”). Westby, supra note 147.\nIt is in many ways the Wild West. Cyberspace has many similarities to a Wild West world . . . The message of this metaphor for cyberspace security is clear: If there is no way to enforce law and order throughout all of cyberspace, which appears to be the case, one must rely on local enclaves of law and order, and trusted friends.\nRICHARD O. HUNDLEY &amp; ROBERT H. ANDERSON, EMERGING CHALLENGE SECURITY AND SAFETY IN CYBERSPACE 12, reprinted from IEEE TECHNOLOGY AND SOCIETY MAGAZINE (1995/1996). International scholars have also recognized the Wild West nature of the internet. See Richard de Silva, Cyber Law: Navigating the Legalities of Digital Weapons, CYBER DEF. &amp; NETWORK SECURITY, Oct. 2012.\n “It’s unfair that hackers can do whatever they want and companies have to follow rules . . .” said Ronen Kenig, director of security product marketing at Radware.” Egan, supra note 293.\nAUGUST 2013 • THE ARMY LAWYER • DA PAM 27-50-483",

Kessinger*\n## I. Introduction\nAt any given time, millions upon millions of people connect to each other via cyberspace. While a convenient method for grandparents to view pictures of their grandchildren, the Internet is also an exceedingly effective vehicle by which to attack a state, a company, or an individual. These attacks occur with frightening frequency, over 1,000 per hour in Great Britain alone; and Britain recognizes the severity of the cyber threat. In the first four days of the November 2012 fighting between Israel and Gaza militants, over 44 million attacks on Israeli websites and an estimated 100 million total attacks occurred. Cyber-attacks cost Australia “an average of $2 million per incident” and exceed a billion dollars per year. Successful attacks also occur against international bodies, such as the International Atomic Energy Agency. These cyber attacks seek not only military targets, but also industrial espionage.\nDespite the frequency and increasing severity of cyber attacks, many governments and industries around the world, to include the United States, are either seemingly helpless against the cyber onslaught, too dysfunctional to create a useful offensive or defensive cyber scheme, or are “highly immature with limited vision and strategic foresight.” Some foreign jurisdictions, our allies in the fight against cyber-attacks, fail to stem the tide of these attacks and now punish the cyber victims.\nThis article explores the improbable, if not politically impossible, application of the letter of marque concept to the cyber arena. Despite the likely political stigma such a proposition would have in today’s Congress, letters of marque are nevertheless a constitutional and valid tool to execute cyber operations, and thus worthy of discussion.\nProposed defenses to cyber attacks are becoming increasingly complex and bizarre.

Militarily, the government retains control over the letter of marque holder (a \"privateer\") and responsibilities as delineated within the express terms of the letter of marque while at the same time broadening the military's reach.$^{19}$ As a law enforcement tool, a letter of marque deputizes an individual or company, thus vesting that entity with police powers. This authority allows the privateer to detain targets, bring them before the sovereign, and receive compensation based on successes, much like a bounty hunter.$^{20}$ Using civilian forces in a military/national defense context is not a concept limited to antiquity. For example, monitored non-governmental civilian participation in governmental operations exists with private military contractors. The United States spent over $300 billion on military contractors from 2001–2007.$^{21}$\nThere is an apparent aversion to the use of letter of marque and privateers.$^{22}$ Various bills introduced throughout\nthe years proposing the revival of letter of marque have stalled or failed outright.$^{23}$ Despite the hesitation, letters of marque and privateers served a legitimate military purpose,$^{24}$ both in supplementing regular combat forces and crippling enemy commerce while protecting American commerce.$^{25}$ A cyber letter of marque would enable a privateer to seize digital assets, disrupt fiscal and communication networks, destroy attacking networks,$^{26}$ and act as a cyber bounty hunter.\nApplying a letter of marque scheme to the cyber world would not only provide authority for American companies to defend themselves from cyber threats, but also allow them to take proactive measures to neutralize a cyber threat before it coalesces into danger. In addition to providing requisite authorization, a letter of marque scheme would regulate the conduct of a prospective cyber privateer and ensure accountability to effect compliance with the letter of marque's mandate.\nPart II of this article examines the historical usage of letters of marque and privateers. A brief historical discussion shows the use of letters of marque in national defense. Such historical perspective provides a useful background when considering their application to cyberspace. Part III applies legal and historical principles to a modern letter of marque regime. In particular, the application of letters of marque within the context of existing technologies and proposed authorization and oversight safeguards are examined. The various laws implicated in a modern cyber letter of marque regime are reviewed in Part IV. Finally, Part V addresses the authorizations and oversight necessary to effectively manage a successful, and lawful, cyber letter of marque regime. While not meant to be an exhaustive analysis of all possible facets related to the implementation of a cyber letter of marque regime, this article shows that despite some initial political and legal issues, using a cyber letter of marque can effectively mitigate the threats posed by cyber attacks.\n## II. History of Letter of Marque and Privateering\nThe concept of allowing private individuals to wage war on a foreign sovereign is not new, nor is it unique to United\nAUGUST 2013 • THE ARMY LAWYER • DA PAM 27-50-483\nStates history. The letter of marque and privateering concepts have been a part of both international law and the accepted norms of warfare for centuries, despite the Declaration of Paris—which purportedly banned privateering. Hugo Grotius, considered by many to be the father of the modern Law of Armed Conflict, noted that letters of marque and reprisal are endorsed by the entirety of the law of nations. Historians credit the expansion and development of the Western world from 1600 to 1815 to privateers.\nThe letter of marque originally served as a “self-help” authorization, allowing a private individual to seek reprisal against a foreigner who caused him harm. Over time, this developed into a government’s authorization to act on its behalf and seize property belonging to an enemy government, usually in the form of ships and cargo. In its most fundamental form, a letter or marque authorized private merchant ships to carry arms in self-defense.\nUpon its founding, due to its small navy, not only did the United States employ letters of marque, but it also was “the world’s biggest proponent of privateering.” The Continental Congress issued many letters of marque, as did individual states. In fact, John Adams reportedly called an early letter of marque scheme, the Massachusetts Armed Vessels Act, “one of the most important documents of the Revolution.”\nThomas Jefferson was also an ardent proponent of privateering: “every possible encouragement should be given to privateering in time of war. . . . Our national ships are too few . . . to . . . retaliate the [sic] acts of the enemy. But by licensing private armed vessels, the whole naval force of the nation is truly brought to bear on the foe.” Jefferson also realized that letters of marque served more than an offensive purpose, detailing how they are also a means of self-defense:\nThe ship Jane is an English merchant vessel . . . employed in the commerce between Jamaica and these States. She brought here a cargo of produce . . . and was to take away . . . flour. Knowing of the war when she left Jamaica, and that our coast was lined with small French privateers, she armed for her defense [sic], and took one of those commissions usually called letters of marque. She arrived here safely . . . Can it be necessary to say that a merchant vessel is not a privateer? That though she has arms to defend herself in time of war, in the course of her regular commerce, this no more makes her a privateer, than a husbandman following his plough in time of war, with a knife or pistol in his pocket, is thereby made a soldier. The occupation of a privateer is attack and plunder, that of a merchant\nAUGUST 2013 • THE ARMY LAWYER • DA PAM 27-50-483\nvessel is commerce and self-preservation.\nSupport for letters of marque by the founding fathers was not merely philosophical consent. Thomas Paine and George Washington both owned stock in privateering ventures. Additionally, Benjamin Franklin practically ran his own privateering operation while he was assigned to France. While most privateering ventures were for money, Franklin used the captured British ships, goods and men to trade for American prisoners of war.\nPrivateering in general weakened an enemy’s economy and its ability to wage war. The American privateers devastated British commerce, funding the first two years of the war substantially through British captures. By early 1777, the British had lost 250 ships, resulting in the collapse of several major London-based West India merchant companies. Within a year, American privateers captured 559 British ships. Of the approximately 796 British ships captured during the Revolutionary War, American privateers and armed merchant ships accounted for roughly 600. British merchants, feeling the crippling effect of American privateers, ensured that “every pressure was brought to bear on Parliament for [the Revolutionary War’s] discontinuance.” Even ships carrying linen from England to Ireland feared the American privateers, to the point of demanding warship escorts.\nAt the outset of the War of 1812, the British Navy consisted of 1,060 warships. In contrast, the United States Navy had only sixteen, including several that were unfit for sea. As a consequence, the United States Navy was not considered to be a serious threat to British naval superiority. In response, Congress passed a statute authorizing the use of privateers, but tightly controlled them. The President could revoke, “at pleasure,” any letters of marque he issued after June 1812. The applicant had to list specific details about the ship, crew, and owners, and “Ample security” submitted to ensure compliance with both international and United States law. Further, and perhaps most relevant to modern application, the ship commanders were required to keep a detailed log of everything “that occurs, daily, and transmit them to the government,” and regular United States Navy commanders had to examine these logbooks when “meeting the privateer at sea.” Failure to abide by these rules would mean forfeiture of the bond and “of all interest in any captures which they may make.”\nWith this new authorization in hand, American privateers wreaked havoc on British shipping and secured victory in America’s second war for independence. In the process, privateers tallied $39 million in prizes, or roughly $672.5 million in 2012 dollars.\nFollowing the War of 1812, letters of marque did not disappear from the American landscape. President Andrew Jackson, in 1834, discussed the use of letters of marque against France. Texas, upon declaring independence from Mexico, realized its coast was vulnerable due to a nascent navy. In response, the fledgling Texas legislature began to issue letters of marque with the intent to “protect the coast, harass Mexican shipping, and bring prizes that could be\n Richard, supra note 19, at 437 (citing Letter from Thomas Jefferson, to Gouverneur Morris (Aug. 16, 1793)), in 3 MEMOIR, CORRESPONDENCE AND MISCELLANIES FROM THE PAPERS OF THOMAS JEFFERSON 275 (1829).\n Tabarrok, supra note 21, at 567.\n Id.; see generally WILLIAM BELL CLARK, BEN FRANKLIN’S PRIVATEERS (1956).\n Tabarrok, supra note 21, at 567.\n CARL E.

In all, Texas issued six letters of marque. Similarly, President Polk recognized the lawful ability of Mexico to issue letters of marque during the Mexican American War.\nIn 1856, Britain, France and other titular world powers met in Paris to discuss concerns arising from wartime maritime law. France and Great Britain sought to end privateering as they could not effectively control the use of privateers by their enemies, i.e., the United States and Russia. Great Britain, in particular, recognized privateering as an effective tool of weaker navies that posed a threat to its naval supremacy and sought to contain it. The result of this meeting was the Paris Declaration of 1856, a document attempting to ban privateering.\nThe Paris Declaration contained three major provisions: the first provided that “[p]rivateering is, and remains, abolished;” the second prevented the seizing of enemy goods on neutral ships; and the third prevented capture of neutral goods on enemy ships. Most importantly, the Declaration went to great pains to ensure that its provisions did not apply to any nation save signatories. This provision is important for two reasons.\nFirst, it made clear that it was not intended to be a universal ban on privateering, as it only applied to signatory nations at war with other signatories. Second, as stated in the document, it did not have the power to police the actions of non-signatories.\nThe United States recognized that this agreement was merely a means for England to maintain maritime supremacy at the expense of nations with a smaller seafaring force, and accordingly, demanded conditions prior to capitulation. The United States agreed to acquiesce and sign the document only if protection of all non-contraband private property from capture at sea was included. The United States reasoned that since all private property is protected on land, “why should it not be [protected] also on the sea?”\nWhile the United States wanted to ensure it would be allowed to trade with both sides of a conflict, free from privateer entanglements, another more vital concern existed. According to Secretary of State William L. Marcy, “the United States could not forgo the right to send out privateers, which in the past had proved her most effective maritime weapon in time of war, and which, since she had no large navy, were essential to her fighting power.” The United States realized that if privateering was banned, its nascent navy would be no match for the greater naval might of countries such as Britain and France. As the plenipotentiaries who signed the Declaration would not adequately address American concerns regarding private goods, and factoring in Marcy’s concern about the resulting unequal balance of naval power, the United States refused to sign the agreement.\nThe issue of privateering arose again in April 1861 when Confederate President Jefferson Davis, with Confederate Congressional approval, issued letters of\n TEXAS PRIVATEERS, https://www.tsl.state.tx.us/exhibits/navy/privateers.html (last modified Aug. 30, 2011).\n Although President Polk did take issue with the blank letters of marque issued by Mexico, arguing those were illegal under international law and those acting in accordance with such letters are considered to be pirates.

Perhaps fearing the involvement of the British or French navies in the conflict, the Union declared that it would follow the Declaration and not issue letters of marque and Secretary of State Seward instructed American ambassadors to determine whether the signatories would be amicable to incorporating the proposed changes advocated by Marcy, thus allowing the United States to formally sign the Declaration. As an indication of the Union’s fear of privateers, Secretary Seward authorized acquiescence to the Declaration even if the requested exceptions were not approved. Britain and France declined the advances and the United States remained a non-signatory.\nConsequently, the Union passed a statutory authorization for President Lincoln to issue letters of marque and declared that all attempts to disrupt, capture or destroy Union shipping would be treated as piracy and dealt with as such. Regardless, the British entered the Civil War as privateers, sailing under letters of marque issued by the Confederacy. In fact, in a case brought by the United States against Britain for damages caused by a privateer, an international tribunal found no issue with a non-signatory (the Confederacy) issuing letters of marque to a signatory (Britain) “to construct, furnish, and crew ships to be used in commerce raids against a non-signatory, the United States.”\nWhen the United States entered into conflict with the Spanish during the Spanish American War, neither the United States nor Spain was a signatory to the Declaration of Paris. Not only did Spain specifically reserve the right to issue letters of marque, the Spanish government recognized\nAmerica’s right and ability to issue the same. The Spanish never carried out the threat, and President McKinley, for the first time, articulated a U.S. intention to comply with the Paris Declaration, though still not be a signatory.\nDespite the reluctance, both Spain and the United States found ways to unofficially authorize privateers without formally issuing letters of marque. Both nations organized “auxiliary cruisers of the Navy.” The United States Navy chartered private merchant ships, heavily armed them, and subsequently entered into naval service. The Navy used the ships and manned them with the owner’s regular, ostensibly civilian crew, placing the ships “under the entire control of the senior naval officer on board.” One such ship, the City of Paris, actually took prizes, with the United States Prize Court holding that she was not a “vessel of the Navy nor a privateer . . . ” and finally ruling that she was an “armed vessel in the service of the United States” and the civilian crew was “entitled as of right to share in the prize money.”\nWhile the nature of privateering changed with the Spanish-American War, privateering did not disappear. At the 1907 Hague Peace Conference, the United States again voiced its opposition to the privateering prohibition. Specifically, the United States voiced the same concerns as\n ADAMS, supra note 72, at 141; JAMES D.

Applying Letters of Marque to Cyber Warfare\nLetters of marque were the original “self-help” governmental authorization. While used to great effect in the past, they can now be resurrected and used to achieve similar results, especially in a cyber context. This section addresses the use of a cyber letter of marque in three areas: seizing assets; disrupting, disabling, and dismantling adversarial networks; and conducting cyber bounty hunting and rewards programs.\n## A. Seizing Assets\nIn a modern cyber letter of marque scheme, the U.S. government would authorize certain companies or individuals to track, freeze, and seize the illicit funds of designated criminal organizations. The net effect would be cutting off supplies to deliver the United States from its enemies. For example, the United States has recently named several Russians as “transnational criminals” and promulgated an Executive Order that authorizes “seizure of their assets in the United States and prevents them from banking in dollars anywhere in the world.”\nWhen rogue states, such as Iran, contravene the will of the international community, the most used method of ensuring compliance is via the United Nations Security Council or unilateral economic sanctions. The United States first instituted sanctions against Iran in 1979, following the seizure of the American Embassy during the Iranian Revolution. These sanctions included freezing roughly $11 billion in Iranian assets. Iran continues to launder and hide money in contravention of these resolutions, often with the help of international banks. In just one instance, the illicit transactions totaled $250 billion. Iran has also turned to China, specifically its banking system, for help in escaping economic sanctions. Illicit money laundering in contravention of United Nations resolutions is not limited to Iran, but has also included North Korea, Cuba, Sudan, and Mexican criminal cartels.\n See supra Part II.\n CHOATE, supra note 98, at 40.\n Id.\n Some have alleged that blimps operated on the west coast of the United States during World War II pursuant to letters of marque. “The Los Angeles based Resolute was the only airship . . . operated for the Navy under privateer status. . . .” JAMES SHOCK &amp; DAVID SMITH, THE GOODYEAR AIRSHIPS 43 (2002).

A cyber letter of marque would allow a privateer to seek these illicit funds wherever they may be hidden and either seize them or digitally sequester them for further law enforcement action. Such a cyber letter of marque brings to bear a formidable resource that will increase the likelihood for seizure of illicit funds and the shutdown of avenues for illicit funding.\nThe idea of using a letter of marque to effect an economic result is not novel. John Adams, in singing the virtues of privateering, said “[I]t is by cutting off supplies, not by attacks, sieges, or assaults, that I expect deliverance from enemies.”[119] While letters of marque during the\nRevolutionary War and the War of 1812 had distinct military objectives, they were \"also a means of commercial warfare conducted for profit.\"[120] Privateers \"were engaged not in patriotic, but business ventures.\"[121] Some privateers amassed great fortunes through their letter of marque commissions,[122] with even the common seaman receiving up to one thousand dollars above his regular wage from just one voyage.[123] The proceeds from captured enemy goods, once sold via the Unites States Prize Courts, were split between the privateer and the sovereign, thus providing a much needed injection of funds to the government and the privateer, while at the same time depriving the enemy of resources.[124]\nMotivated by the possibility of retaining a healthy percentage of the roughly $1.6 trillion presently illicitly laundered worldwide, the number of prospective cyber privateers would be legion. Consequently, the United States government would be in a position to demand an exorbitantly high bond, thus guaranteeing that only the most technically proficient and responsible cyber privateers would seek the commission. As for the cyber profiteer, the prospect of sharing a large percentage of the trillions of dollars, not to mention the potential for criminal or tort liability,[125] would ensure strict compliance with the terms of the letter of marque. As the privateer in the 1700s and 1800s provided both a much needed governmental funding stream[126] and served a valid national security function, so too would a modern cyber privateer by removing illicit funds from the hands of organized crime and sanction violators. The end result would be a potential death blow to crime organizations and rogue regimes.\nCurrently, the law restricts anyone from attempting to seize assets, whether they belong to the most deplorable rogue regime or the most vicious drug cartel. A cyber letter of marque would vest responsible and vetted entities with authority to digitally seize illicit funds while providing legal protections from criminal and/or civil liability. Current laws restricting attempted seizures would remain in place for those acting without a valid letter of marque or those\nAUGUST 2013 • THE ARMY LAWYER • DA PAM 27-50-483\noperating outside the scope of their letter of marque commissions.\n## B. Disrupting, Disabling, and Dismantling Adversarial Networks\nIn December 2012, a cybercriminal known as “vorVzakone” announced Project Blitzkrieg, wherein he planned to attack 30 Unites States banks in an attempt to steal money from accounts belonging to the “rich.” McAfee Labs, a leading computer security company, determined that this “is a credible threat to the financial industry and appears to be moving forward as planned.” The projected losses from the announced attack could reach “hundreds of millions of dollars.” The targets of the planned attack included Bank of America, Capitol One, Suntrust, Ameritrade, eTrade, and Fidelity and Schwab. From April to December 2012, vorVzakone claimed at least 500 cyber victims.\nAt roughly the same time that the U.S. banking industry began to deal with vorVzakone, bank officials were contending with cyber attacks emanating from Iran.

These attacks continue because, in part, there is no disincentive for the bad actors, as they know nothing will happen to them. However, if the United States authorized tightly controlled offensive cyber capabilities via a congressionally authorized cyber letter of marque, the nation could allow a U.S. cyber entity to neutralize the attacker and their capabilities. As a direct consequence, the attacks will most likely cease and the attackers will move to easier targets. In essence, a cyber letter of marque would “arm” U.S. entities, thus allowing them to protect themselves in much the same way the historical letters of marque allowed merchant ships to arm themselves for self-defense purposes.\nAs with seizure of assets, ample historical support exists for the use of privateering in the disruption of enemy activity. As discussed previously, American privateers disrupted English commerce to such an extent that several London-based firms went bankrupt. British merchants,\ntheir livelihoods so disrupted and, in fact, disabled, put pressure on their own government to end the war and allow the Americans to have their independence. The financial toll on the enemy during the War of 1812 by American privateers was staggering, which in turn had the operative effect of weakening both British naval superiority and morale in England. If privateering proved to be such an effective defensive weapon in a naval context, it can certainly be used in a cyber context where disrupting an enemy’s attack can be done through a keyboard by a handful of individuals instead of through fourteen-gun warships manned by over a hundred crewmen.\n## C. Cyber Bounty Hunting\nThe realm of cyber letters of marque is not limited to offensive or defensive actions in the classic sense. A cyber letter of marque could also be utilized as a method of bounty hunting, providing information to law enforcement agencies necessary to apprehend a cyber attacker.\nBounty hunting, like a letter of marque, is an activity intertwined with the history of the United States. The United States Supreme Court endorsed bounty hunting as a legal activity in the 1872 case *Taylor v. Taintor*. The federal government endorsed, and continues to endorse, bounty hunting for capture (as opposed to kill) as exemplified in the most wanted lists. Perhaps most famously, the United\n Bardin, *supra* note 13.\n *Id.*; Jody Westby, *Caution: Active Response to Cyber Attacks Has High Risk*, FORBES.COM, Nov. 29, 2012, http://www.forbes.com/sites/jodywestby/2012/11/29/caution-active-response-to-cyber-attacks-has-high-risk/.\n *N.

They may exercise their rights in person or by agent. They may pursue him into another State; may arrest him on the Sabbath; and, if necessary, may break and enter his house for that purpose.

Virginia also establishes criminal liability for operating as a bounty hunter without a valid license.

This, arguably, would be illegal under current United States law.\nThe Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) serves as a barrier to a corporation or individual from coming to the aid of a cyber-attack victim. Congress could carefully draft cyber letter of marquee legislation authorizing such entities to track and digitally “capture” a cyber criminal or terrorist. The only difference between the reward/bounty programs currently operated by the United States Government and a cyber letter of marque is the antiquated CFAA prohibition.\nIndeed, other scholars have posited the use of bounty hunting letters of marque. For example, Robert P. DeWitte, writing in the Indiana Law Journal, discussed one of the potential downfalls between physical, as opposed to virtual, bounty hunting through the use of a letter of marque. In particular, he illuminated the legitimate concern that “state authorities could conceivably attempt to capture and/or kill privateers” in their territory while operating under a valid U.S. letter of marque. However, this concern in a cyber letter of marque context is not applicable since the cyber privateer/bounty hunter would be safely ensconced in the territorial United States, outside the physical reach of an unfriendly foreign armed force.\nJust as letters of marque are constitutional, so too are bounties, as over a hundred years of U.S. jurisprudence demonstrates. The issuance of a cyber letter of marque\n See, e.g., NAT’L ASS’N FUGITIVE RECOVERY AGENTS (N.A.F.R.A.), http://fugitive-recovery.org/ (last visited Dec. 24, 2012); NAT’L ASS’N BAIL BOND INVESTIGATORS, http://nabbi.org/ (last visited Dec. 24, 2012).\n The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1030 (2006), would most likely prevent a company or individual from taking these steps.

A cyber letter of marque would allow a cyber privateer access to those established and protected legal mechanisms.\n## IV. Legal Barriers\nDespite the many potential applications of a cyber letter of marque, some arguments raise concerns about the legality of its application. When discussing letters of marque, most commentators cite to the same alleged legal barriers to implementation: domestic law, usually the CFAA; the Law of Armed Conflict, specifically attribution and self-defense concerns; the Paris Declaration of 1856; and the Council of Europe Convention on Cyber-crime. This section examines each of these areas and analyzes why they are not legal barriers to the implementation of a cyber letter of marque regime.\n### A. The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act\nThe Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, initially a criminal statute protecting government computers and those computers belonging to entities with compelling government interests, forces companies under attack to “just stand and take a beating.” Since its passage in 1984, it has expanded to include civil liability by prohibiting anyone from “intentionally access[ing] a protected computer without authorization or exceed[ing] authorized access . . . [and recklessly causing damage involving a loss of] at least\n$5,000 in value.” The definition of a “protected computer” has expanded to cover not only U.S. government computers, but also any computer “used in a manner that affects interstate or foreign commerce.” Even those computers located outside the United States are protected. Potentially, every single computer connected to the internet anywhere in the world would be a “protected computer” pursuant to the CFAA, including, potentially, a blue-tooth-enabled garage door opener or coffeemaker in suburbia.\nWhile the CFAA prohibits the mere access to a protected computer, causing damage seems to be the lynchpin to triggering civil and criminal penalties under the CFAA. Some courts have homed in on the damage requirement, refusing to find civil or criminal liability. For example, in *Moulton v. VC3*, the court held that an unauthorized port scan and throughput test of a defendant’s servers is not a violation of the CFAA since no “damage” was caused. Likewise, in *United States v. Czubinski*, the court reversed the criminal conviction of an IRS agent who accessed a “protected computer” to satisfy his curiosity.\nWhile some of the judicial decisions seem to allow some degree of cyber intelligence collection under the current regulatory scheme, the courts clearly would not allow an entity to seize assets, whether they are being laundered at a major international bank or if information leading to their location is on a drug kingpin’s desktop\n\n This included not only government computers and networks, but also those of large banks, the New York Stock Exchange, etc. Robert B.

Consequently, government authorization would first be a necessity.\nDespite allowing for criminal and civil penalties, the CFAA is not an effective means of preventing cyber attacks. Some have argued that active-defense authorizations, such as a letter of marque, are not necessary as the cyber victim can turn over evidence of a cyber attack to the FBI for prosecution. While this might work in theory, in actual practice it leaves the cyber victim virtually remediless for a host of reasons. For one, law enforcement personnel are questionably competent when it comes to cyber attacks and cyber crime. Further, due to the global nature of cyber attacks, an American court might have a difficult time bringing a cyber attacker within its jurisdiction. Even if a cyber attack victim captures all the information necessary to conduct a thorough law enforcement investigation, the FBI has bungled such gift-wrapped cyber cases in the past.\nJust as cyber criminals are capable of seizing money from an individual’s bank accounts, cyber companies with the technical expertise can track down and seize illicit funds, given the proper governmental authorization. A cyber letter of marque would provide such authorization.\n## B. Attribution and Self-Defense\nAttribution is the legal requirement to positively identify the attacker prior to responding with force in self-defense. How does a prospective cyber privateer ensure it is striking the proper target and how does a cyber-privateer cover their tracks so as to not entice further attacks? Admittedly, discovering the source of a cyber attack is “the most important aspect of active defense.” It necessarily must be a requirement when issuing a cyber letter of marque to ensure that the privateer is targeting the proper bad actor. Critics have complained that it is too difficult to identify the attacker with sufficient accuracy to ensure a counter-attack is accurately aimed. While tracing an attack may not provide actionable results, and some technologies “limit the ability to make perfect surgical strikes with active defense,” the problem may not be as big as it appears. Some speculate that it is more difficult for the bad actor to identify the cyber privateer than it is for the cyber privateer to identify the bad actor.\nThe attribution concerns may, however, be a bit overblown. Even the Russian cyber attacks launched or encouraged against Estonia could be traced back to the “Russian intelligence apparatus.” In fact, “attribution to at least some level will almost always be possible.” While the exact technologies available to ensure accurate attribution, which can be done in seconds, are not the focus of this paper, such technology is not new and “is currently the subject of a significant amount of research aimed at improving accuracy and efficiency.” While it may not be feasible, or even possible, to accurately attribute 100 million cyber attacks, “it is clear that the current state of the\n See, e.g., NRC REPORT, supra note 18 (discussing the exemption for lawfully authorized law enforcement and intelligence agencies activities to the CFAA and how government agencies may commandeer private computes or pay for their usage).\n See supra Part I (discussing of the frequency of cyber attacks). The CFAA, in one form or another, has been in effect since 1984. It has had little to no affect on cyber attacks.\n See, e.g., Westby, supra note 147.\n Ms. Westby, while arguing a cyber victim should turn over information to law enforcement instead of proactively defending themselves, admits that “there are too few of them with skills adequate to match the sophisticated nature of today’s cyber criminals.” Id. Others have agreed with her assessment that there are too few cyber-competent law enforcement officers.

Paris Declaration of 1856\nMost critics of the letter of marque, regardless of its application, usually point to the Paris Declaration of 1856, noting that the United States is prohibited from employing privateers due to the agreement. This argument, however, is without merit.\nFirst, the Declaration does not apply to the United States per the plain language of the treaty. “The present Declaration is not and shall not be binding, except between those Powers who have acceded, or shall accede, to it.” The United States did not accede to it in 1856 and has not, in the ensuing 157 years, acceded to it. Under the rules of treaty interpretation, a treaty is binding only upon parties to it, and it “does not create either obligations or rights for a third State without its consent.” Further, in order to impose an obligation on a third State, it must “expressly accept that obligation in writing.” To date, the United States has not consented to the obligations of the Declaration in writing, as required by the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.\nAdditionally, the Declaration clearly pertains, and limits itself, to maritime law. Since a cyber letter of marque regime is not grounded in maritime law and letters of marque are specifically authorized in the United States Constitution, it is permissible under international law, Paris Declaration notwithstanding, to issue cyber letters of marque.\nOthers argue that the Declaration has become customary international law. While this might be true at first blush, it ignores the legal and historical fact. A nation, not otherwise bound by a treaty, does not become bound by operation of the rule of customary international law if it has been a persistent objector. In order to be considered a persistent objector, and therefore not bound by a treaty, the State “must have objected to the emergence of a new norm during its formation and continue to object afterwards.” Even if it has been state practice to follow the precepts in a treaty, non-signatory states can alter their actions in order to confront new threats.\nRegarding the Declaration of Paris, the United States objected during the formation of the proposed privateering ban and objected to the Declaration by passing legislation authorizing privateers during the Civil War; the Spanish government recognized America’s right to issue letters of marque during the Spanish-American War, and voiced opposition at the 1907 Hague Peace Conference. Clearly, the United States has been a persistent objector to the Declaration and thus not bound by it. Simply stated, American privateering declined not because of acquiescence to international treaties which it did not, and had no intent to, sign. Rather, privateering declined because America, after 1898, no longer had a nascent navy, had become a major\nAUGUST 2013 • THE ARMY LAWYER • DA PAM 27-50-483\nnaval power, and the “cost-saving advantages of privateering [had] declined.”\nAssuming, *arguendo*, that the Paris Declaration is customary international law that the United States must follow, the issuance of cyber letters of marque is still not banned. The Declaration never defines privateers. As history demonstrates, a contracted civilian ship can be armed, staffed with civilians, fight, and take prizes—all without violating the Declaration.\n## D. The Council of Europe Convention on Cyber-Crime\nOn 23 November 2001, the United States signed on to the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime. The Cybercrime Convention came into effect in the United States on 1 January 2007. The Cybercrime Convention’s main objective “is to pursue a common criminal policy aimed at the protection of society against cyber-crime, especially by adopting appropriate legislation and fostering international co-operation.” It purports to allow countries to work together through substantive, procedural, and jurisdictional laws against a cyber criminal committing crimes in one country while physically located in another. Prior to the Cybercrime Convention (and some would argue even today), the cyber police forces in the United States or internationally did not have the tools or authority necessary to combat cyber-attacks. Additionally, it did not address the\ncultural issues that may arise from crimes committed in cyberspace. To make matters worse, some countries did not have adequate laws against cyber-crime.\nAn attempt to correct these law enforcement deficiencies was the impetus for the creation of the Cybercrime Convention. It remains the only international treaty attempting to deal with the issue of transcontinental cyber attacks. It fails, however, to effectively protect anyone from cyber attacks. It is largely a symbolic document, serving mainly to reassure the public that governments are doing *something* to address the threat. Those reassurances are hollow, as only roughly half of the ratifying states have passed domestic legislation required to enforce the document.\nRemarkably, the exceptions contained in the Cybercrime Convention negate its impact. First, no requirement exists that any cyber attacker actually be prosecuted; instead, the State must merely “report the final outcome to the requesting Party [i.e., the cyber victim’s nation] in due course.” In addition, nearly every enforcement provision of the Cybercrime Convention contains a legislative flaw, allowing a nation state to refuse to cooperate. A nation may refuse a request for assistance during or after a cyber attack emanating from its country for a host of reasons. These reasons include, but are not limited to: if a request for assistance would violate domestic laws, if a request for assistance and information gained\nAUGUST 2013 • THE ARMY LAWYER • DA PAM 27-50-483\ntherefrom could be used in any investigation or court proceedings other than those listed in the request, or if an attacked nation believes there are political issues at play.\nPerhaps as a sign of the naïve belief that the feckless Cybercrime Convention will actually curb cyber attacks, the Council of Europe’s Committee of Experts on Terrorism opined in February 2010 that no further conventions are needed to address cyber terrorism because “large scale attacks on computer systems appeared to be already covered by the Cybercrime Convention.” Yet two days later, on 18 February 2010, The Washington Post broke the story that more than 75,000 computers and roughly 2,500 companies in the United States, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Turkey, and Mexico were victims of “one of the largest and most sophisticated attacks by cyber criminals discovered to date.” The attack began in 2008 and was not discovered until January 2010.\nIn the United States, an unnamed Department of Justice official purportedly alleged that the “impact of the convention [is] ‘very positive,’” which, again, seems to ignore the reality of cyber attack’s scope. To the contrary, the Cybercrime Convention seems to merely limit the ability of a law-abiding entity to take proactive steps necessary to cease a cyber threat.\nBecause the Cybercrime Convention does not diminish cyber attacks, lacks any enforcement or prosecution mechanism and expressly states that signatory states pass domestic criminal laws covering “illegal access,” “illegal interception,” criminal “misuse of devices,” [emphasis added], the United States is not prevented from issuing letters of marque. If Congress exercised its constitutionally authorized power to issue letters of marque, limited to cyber operations, no violation of any provision of the Convention would occur because no domestic criminal acts occur.\nEven the U.S. Attorney General stated, in 2006, that the Cybercrime Convention “is in full accord with all U.S. Constitutional protections.” The activity undertaken pursuant to a constitutionally authorized and congressionally endorsed cyber letter of marque would not, under United States law, be illegal and thus not a violation of any provision contained in the Cybercrime Convention. In short, a cyber letter of marque issued by Congress would not violate the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime.\n## V. Authorizations and Oversight\nWhile a cyber letter of marque is legal, both under domestic and international law, any cyber letter of marque regime must provide for a method of authorizing and subsequently supervising a cyber privateer. This section discusses some potential methods of authorization and oversight necessary for an effective cyber letter of marque regime.\n## A. Issuance of Bonds and Authorizations\nPrior to the issuance of a letter of marque, all prospective cyber privateers should be required to register with a central governmental database. This database would provide the supervising agency with a means of not only policing cyber privateers and holding them accountable, but also a means for parties allegedly aggrieved by United States authorized cyber privateers to seek redress. Such a database and registration would also allow the supervisory agency an opportunity to vet the putative cyber privateer. “If a company does not have the skills to defend its systems, it likely does not have the skills to attack back—or make\nAUGUST 2013 • THE ARMY LAWYER • DA PAM 27-50-483\n\nDo we really think that establishing a convention on cyber crime is going to stop our adversaries?

All this does is force offensive cyber forces to establish an unwieldy ‘rules of engagement’ that ties the hands of those who can execute offensive cyber actions.\nBardin, *supra* note 13.\n\ndecisions about whether to engage in such actions.” If the applicant does not possess the requisite skills, then its request for a cyber letter of marque is denied.\nFurther, all applicants must be able to post a bond commensurate with potential liability exposure. “Letters of marque should only be issued to security firms able to post a significant bond and meet specific qualification and training requirements.” The bond requirement is the most effective method for screening out “start-ups” and “fly-by-night” security companies from seeking a letter of marque. The Act Concerning Letters-of-Marque, Prizes &amp; Prize Goods specifically states that before the issuance of any commission of letters of marque, a bond in the amount of five thousand dollars, or ten thousand dollars if the ship had more than one hundred and fifty men, would have to be paid by two “responsible sureties, not interested in such vessel.” The payment of such a steep bond ensures that privateers strictly adhere to congressional rules.\nIn a cyber context, since the stakes are so high, a prospective cyber privateer should be required to supply a large monetary bond. A large monetary bond would not only ensure that responsible entities apply for and receive cyber letters of marque, but also that those with the requisite discretion and technical expertise are the only ones acting with congressional authority as a cyber privateer. The prime importance of competent exercise of the powers enumerated in the letter of marque is underscored when the vast amount of money and intellectual property lost on a frequent and recurring basis, coupled with the exacting nature of establishing positive identification, especially attribution, is contemplated. A large monetary bond would, in effect, keep the cyber cutthroats out of this business.\nSingapore established CaseTrust, a similar system, in order to protect consumers engaged in e-commerce. CaseTrust receives complaints against e-vendors and legitimizes member companies. Prior to joining, a\nprospective e-vendor must give a banker’s guarantee, or a bond, to establish that it is indeed a legitimate and reputable company. The CaseTrust system provides for compulsory adjudication including the power to not only fine a vendor, but also to revoke its certification. As a result, the consumer is protected by providing a source of bonded companies and a policing mechanism. Additionally, the commercial entities are shrouded with governmental legitimacy. To date, enforcement has been effective and participation is growing.\nIn a historical context, the putative privateer kept detailed daily logs, which were available for inspection by any U.S. naval commander he might encounter. Similar requirements would be made of cyber privateers. As all internet activity can be, or actually is, easily monitored, this requirement does not place too onerous a burden on the purported cyber privateer. While most private companies are loathe to share details of their cyber activity for fear of losing intellectual property, a competitive edge, or disclose their cyber defenses or weaknesses, a company serious about executing a defensive or even offensive cyber letter of marque should be willing to accept the more stringent scrutiny, such as reviewing cyber logbooks.\nA cyber letter of marque would designate the bearers to be licensed combatants for the sovereign, authorizing them to “bear arms” in the cyber sense of the word, and either defend against specific attacks and launch counter attacks (back-backs) or engage in offensive cyber operations directed at sovereign selected targets or networks. A private company could be granted authorization to conduct a hack-back, temporarily incapacitating a cyber bad actor, and then notify the appropriate law enforcement or national security entity for final apprehension or network termination.\nAUGUST 2013 • THE ARMY LAWYER • DA PAM 27-50-483\nIn recognition that cyber privateers would, to a certain extent, be bearing arms, a workable set of rules of engagement would necessarily be a major part of the actual commission. Professor Susan Brenner has expressed concerns that cyber privateers could be motivated to vigilantism and exceed the bounds of their charter, exhibiting an inability to determine who is a just target. These concerns can be easily alleviated by carefully drafted rules of engagement and scope of authorization in the letter of marque commission itself. If cyber privateers exceed the scope of the commission, they lose their substantial bond, face debarment from future government contracts, and open themselves up to potential criminal prosecutions since their actions were outside the scope of the immunity granted by the letter of marque. These adverse ramifications should keep a vetted and approved cyber privateer in line.\n## B. Legal and Judicial Oversight\nThe legal framework for a workable letter of marque regime already exists under current federal law. “Privateering worked only because it was backed by a substantial system of law, not only the common law of property, but also the statutory creations such as admiralty courts and bond requirements.” The federal judiciary is vested with original jurisdiction to determine prizes, burdens of proof established, the due process rights of both the captor and the captive duly considered, and the\nsecuritylaw.us/2012/11/30/steven-chabinsky-crowdstrike-ex-fbi-cyber-division-talks-pprivate-sector-cyberdeterrence-at-abas-natsec-law-conference/.\n Brenner, supra note 212.\n See, e.g., Commissioning Private Vessels for Seizure of Piratical Vessels, 33 U.S.C. § 386 (2006).\nThe President is authorized to instruct the commanders of the public armed vessels of the United States, and to authorize the commanders of any other armed vessels sailing under the authority of any letters of marquee and reprisal granted by Congress, or the commanders of any other suitable vessels, to subdue, seize, take, and, if on the high seas, to send into any port of the United States, any vessel or boat built, purchased, fitted out, or held as mentions in 33 U.S.C. § 385.\nId.\n Tabarrok, supra note 21, at 572.\n Jurisdiction, 10 U.S.C. § 7652 (2006).\n See The Resolution, 2 U.S. 19 (U.S. 1781) (holding that the burden of proving a prize was captured lawfully lies with the captors).\n The legality of a capture is not determined until a court of competent jurisdiction has issued an order making such a determination. Id. Whether property seized may be confiscated as a prize is a judicial question and each case is to be decided on its own facts. Property Captured by the Potomac Flotilla, 10 Op. Att’y Gen. 467 (1863).\ninterests of the United States represented by a duly appointed authority in the “United States attorney for the district in which the prize cause is adjudicated.” In fact, Chapter 655 of 10 U.S.C. contains the entire statutory framework to judicially administer a letter of marque regime.\nHistorical precedence demonstrates that judicial oversight is an effective means to monitor and police privateers. For example, the court invalidated the first two prizes claimed during the War of 1812 because of improperly issued letters of marque. Even the venerable USS Constitution was also involved in an illegitimate capture, a situation embarrassingly rectified by the courts. Indeed, a rich legal history of privateering cases exists before the United States Supreme Court.\nSome are concerned that the government would not be able to control the behavior of modern privateers, especially in a cyber context. In reality, these concerns are easily addressed with stiff consequences. Penalties can include forfeiture of the bond and any pay due as a result of a successful capture or mission, seizure of assets, debarment from all future government contracts, exclusion from future letter of marque commissions, criminal prosecution, and potential tort liability.\nAt least two presidents proposed criminal prosecution for misuse of a letter of marque. President Jefferson, a major proponent of privateering during the Revolutionary War, declared that individuals operating off the coast without valid commissions be captured and tried as pirates.\n Duties of United States Attorney, 10 U.S.C.A. § 7656 (2012).\n Tabarrok, supra note 21, at 568.\n The United States paid the owners of the captured ship $11,000 in damages. PETRIE, supra note 122, at 160.\n See, e.g., In re The Amiable Isabella, Munos, 19 U.S. 1 (1821); The Adeline, 9 Cranch 244 (1815); The Amy Warwick, 67 U.S. 635 (1862).\n Brenner, supra note 212.\n Richard, supra note 19, at 455.\n In a cyber context, this could include all computers and network capabilities.\n\n See The Santissima Trinidad, 20 U.S. 283 (1822) (holding that illegal privateers, whether public or private, “are tortuous—and the original owner is entitled to restitution when brought within our jurisdiction”). Tort liability has real teeth, as government is generally immune from civil suit, whereas a letter of marque holder would not be. See David A. Sklansky, The Private Police, 46 UCLA L. REV. 1165, 1186 (1999); Richard, supra note 19, at 455.\n See supra Part II.\n UPTON, supra note 57, at 180.\nAUGUST 2013 • THE ARMY LAWYER • DA PAM 27-50-483\nPresident Lincoln made a similar proclamation regarding privateers hired by the Confederate States, as he did not believe the “rebellious” states had legal authority to issue letters of marque.\nAccording to some scholars, one of the major drawbacks of the traditional letter of marque system was the lack of organization or unified command, control and communication. To address this concern, all cyber letter of marque holders would report their activities and progress to a central authority on a regular and recurring basis. This central authority would have the ability to terminate the cyber privateer’s commission and/or refer the matter to the Department of Justice for criminal prosecution, should the commissioner act outside the bounds of authority. As this central authority would have an over-arching view of which cyber privateers were acting in which arenas, they could deconflict any possible issues of interrupting law enforcement, intelligence, or national security operations in cyber space. Additionally, purely governmental agencies, such as the National Security Agency, would then be in a better position to work in concert with the cyber privateers to execute specific targeted operations.\n## VI. Conclusion\n“More destructive cyber weapons are being created every day . . . [eventually] . . . those who mean to harm the United States will gain the ability to launch a damaging attack. The United States must develop stronger defenses before this occurs.” Despite this threat, the U.S. government seems to be content with merely allowing network owners to “[sit] there . . . trying to swat away these intrusions.” Industry experts have specifically asked that Congress “provide opportunities and responsibilities to the private sector to hack back.”\nPerhaps in tacit acknowledgement that the private sector is better prepared to handle cyber issues, the United States Air Force solicits private industry for capabilities designed to “destroy, deny, degrade, disrupt, deceive, corrupt, or usurp the adversaries [sic] ability to use the cyberspace domain for his advantage.”\nAdditionally, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DAPRA), through its “Plan X,” sought “innovative research proposals” in an effort to “dominate the cyber battle space.” Congress has not only denied these requests, while at the same time ignoring the Air Force and DARPA’s proposed use of private industry, but at the same time tied their hands with respect to possible civil and criminal liability. Members of Congress have instead suggested legislative mandates requiring “owners and operators of vital infrastructure [to] better protect networks,” or even tax credits as a means of encouraging corporations to establish stricter cyber security safeguards. Congress has failed to provide industry with the tools they are desperately asking for: a means in which to protect themselves in a meaningful way.\nPolitical policy makers must understand that “[i]n cyberspace, the offense has the upper hand” and the nation cannot remain secure while hiding behind a mythical all protective firewall. Accordingly, Congress should exercise its constitutional authority and authorize the\n\nissuance of cyber letters of marque and allow American entities to actively defend themselves in cyber space.\nAs delineated above, the letter of marque has a rich tradition, not only in international and maritime law, but also in American history. Were it not for this power, the United States might not ever have gained her freedom, much less secured it in the War of 1812. The United States justly refused to acquiesce to a ban on privateering and that ban is not binding to this day. As advanced in this article, a cyber letter of marque can, with adequate safeguards in place, protect our current infrastructure, obtain information on emerging threats, and then eliminate such threats. Taking into account the current state of the law and\nthe restrictions that prevent an adequate method of cyber self-defense, it becomes clear that a well thought out cyber letter of marque scheme would be able to address the fears that led to the enactment of the CFAA.\nThe current legal framework allows hackers to do what they please, while network owners must follow onerous statutory rules. The issuance of cyber letters of marque is a constitutionally authorized method of self-defense Congress should authorize to level the cyber playing field.\n “Historian Faye M. Kert offers the judgment that ‘without the presence of the American privateers in the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812, the United States would never have been able to hold off the British Navy.’” SECHREST, supra note 31, at 7.\n See infra Part III.\n This addresses the emotional and intellectually dishonest reactions of “vigilante justice in cyberspace . . . notions of pirates on the high seas and wild west posses” as voiced by people such as Jim Richards of Tangent Capital. Egan, supra note 293.\n Some complain that to allow active-defense, cyberspace would devolve into a “wild west.” (“Allowing companies an exception to the CFAA really would turn the Internet into the Wild West.”). Westby, supra note 147.\nIt is in many ways the Wild West. Cyberspace has many similarities to a Wild West world . . . The message of this metaphor for cyberspace security is clear: If there is no way to enforce law and order throughout all of cyberspace, which appears to be the case, one must rely on local enclaves of law and order, and trusted friends.\nRICHARD O. HUNDLEY &amp; ROBERT H. ANDERSON, EMERGING CHALLENGE SECURITY AND SAFETY IN CYBERSPACE 12, reprinted from IEEE TECHNOLOGY AND SOCIETY MAGAZINE (1995/1996). International scholars have also recognized the Wild West nature of the internet. See Richard de Silva, Cyber Law: Navigating the Legalities of Digital Weapons, CYBER DEF. &amp; NETWORK SECURITY, Oct. 2012.\n “It’s unfair that hackers can do whatever they want and companies have to follow rules . . .” said Ronen Kenig, director of security product marketing at Radware.” Egan, supra note 293.\nAUGUST 2013 • THE ARMY LAWYER • DA PAM 27-50-483"

Kessinger*\n## I. Introduction\nAt any given time, millions upon millions of people connect to each other via cyberspace.¹ While a convenient method for grandparents to view pictures of their grandchildren, the Internet is also an exceedingly effective vehicle by which to attack a state, a company, or an individual. These attacks occur with frightening frequency, over 1,000 per hour in Great Britain alone²; and Britain recognizes the severity of the cyber threat.³ In the first four days of the November 2012 fighting between Israel and Gaza militants, over 44 million attacks on Israeli websites⁴ and an estimated 100 million total attacks occurred.⁵ Cyber-attacks cost Australia “an average of $2 million per incident” and exceed a billion dollars per year.⁶ Successful attacks also occur against international bodies, such as the International Atomic Energy Agency.⁷ These cyber attacks seek not only military targets, but also industrial espionage.⁸\nDespite the frequency and increasing severity of cyber attacks,⁹ many governments and industries around the world, to include the United States, are either seemingly helpless against the cyber onslaught,¹⁰ too dysfunctional¹¹ to create a useful offensive or defensive cyber scheme,¹² or are “highly immature with limited vision and strategic foresight.”¹³ Some foreign jurisdictions, our allies¹⁴ in the fight against cyber-attacks, fail to stem the tide of these attacks and now punish the cyber victims.¹⁵\nThis article explores the improbable, if not politically impossible, application of the letter of marque concept to the cyber arena. Despite the likely political stigma such a proposition would have in today’s Congress, letters of marque are nevertheless a constitutional and valid tool to execute cyber operations, and thus worthy of discussion.\nProposed defenses to cyber attacks are becoming increasingly complex and bizarre.¹⁶ However, one\n* U.S. Army, Judge Advocate.

Militarily, the government retains control over the letter of marque holder (a \"privateer\") and responsibilities as delineated within the express terms of the letter of marque while at the same time broadening the military's reach.$^{19}$ As a law enforcement tool, a letter of marque deputizes an individual or company, thus vesting that entity with police powers. This authority allows the privateer to detain targets, bring them before the sovereign, and receive compensation based on successes, much like a bounty hunter.$^{20}$ Using civilian forces in a military/national defense context is not a concept limited to antiquity. For example, monitored non-governmental civilian participation in governmental operations exists with private military contractors. The United States spent over $300 billion on military contractors from 2001–2007.$^{21}$\nThere is an apparent aversion to the use of letter of marque and privateers.$^{22}$ Various bills introduced throughout\nthe years proposing the revival of letter of marque have stalled or failed outright.$^{23}$ Despite the hesitation, letters of marque and privateers served a legitimate military purpose,$^{24}$ both in supplementing regular combat forces and crippling enemy commerce while protecting American commerce.$^{25}$ A cyber letter of marque would enable a privateer to seize digital assets, disrupt fiscal and communication networks, destroy attacking networks,$^{26}$ and act as a cyber bounty hunter.\nApplying a letter of marque scheme to the cyber world would not only provide authority for American companies to defend themselves from cyber threats, but also allow them to take proactive measures to neutralize a cyber threat before it coalesces into danger. In addition to providing requisite authorization, a letter of marque scheme would regulate the conduct of a prospective cyber privateer and ensure accountability to effect compliance with the letter of marque's mandate.\nPart II of this article examines the historical usage of letters of marque and privateers. A brief historical discussion shows the use of letters of marque in national defense. Such historical perspective provides a useful background when considering their application to cyberspace. Part III applies legal and historical principles to a modern letter of marque regime. In particular, the application of letters of marque within the context of existing technologies and proposed authorization and oversight safeguards are examined. The various laws implicated in a modern cyber letter of marque regime are reviewed in Part IV. Finally, Part V addresses the authorizations and oversight necessary to effectively manage a successful, and lawful, cyber letter of marque regime. While not meant to be an exhaustive analysis of all possible facets related to the implementation of a cyber letter of marque regime, this article shows that despite some initial political and legal issues, using a cyber letter of marque can effectively mitigate the threats posed by cyber attacks.\n## II. History of Letter of Marque and Privateering\nThe concept of allowing private individuals to wage war on a foreign sovereign is not new, nor is it unique to United\nAUGUST 2013 • THE ARMY LAWYER • DA PAM 27-50-483\nStates history. The letter of marque²⁷ and privateering concepts have been a part of both international law and the accepted norms of warfare for centuries,²⁸ despite the Declaration of Paris—which purportedly banned privateering.²⁹ Hugo Grotius, considered by many to be the father of the modern Law of Armed Conflict, noted that letters of marque and reprisal are endorsed by the entirety of the law of nations.³⁰ Historians credit the expansion and development of the Western world from 1600 to 1815 to privateers.³¹\nThe letter of marque originally served as a “self-help” authorization, allowing a private individual to seek reprisal against a foreigner who caused him harm.³² Over time, this developed into a government’s authorization to act on its behalf and seize property belonging to an enemy government, usually in the form of ships and cargo.³³ In its most fundamental form, a letter or marque authorized private merchant ships to carry arms in self-defense.³⁴\nUpon its founding, due to its small navy,³⁵ not only did the United States employ letters of marque, but it also was “the world’s biggest proponent of privateering.”³⁶ The Continental Congress issued many letters of marque,³⁷ as did individual states.³⁸ In fact, John Adams reportedly called an early letter of marque scheme, the Massachusetts Armed Vessels Act, “one of the most important documents of the Revolution.”³⁹\nThomas Jefferson was also an ardent proponent of privateering: “every possible encouragement should be given to privateering in time of war. . . . Our national ships are too few . . . to . . . retaliate the [sic] acts of the enemy. But by licensing private armed vessels, the whole naval force of the nation is truly brought to bear on the foe.”⁴⁰ Jefferson also realized that letters of marque served more than an offensive purpose, detailing how they are also a means of self-defense:\nThe ship Jane is an English merchant vessel . . . employed in the commerce between Jamaica and these States. She brought here a cargo of produce . . . and was to take away . . . flour. Knowing of the war when she left Jamaica, and that our coast was lined with small French privateers, she armed for her defense [sic], and took one of those commissions usually called letters of marque. She arrived here safely . . . Can it be necessary to say that a merchant vessel is not a privateer? That though she has arms to defend herself in time of war, in the course of her regular commerce, this no more makes her a privateer, than a husbandman following his plough in time of war, with a knife or pistol in his pocket, is thereby made a soldier. The occupation of a privateer is attack and plunder, that of a merchant\nAUGUST 2013 • THE ARMY LAWYER • DA PAM 27-50-483\nvessel is commerce and self-preservation.⁴¹\nSupport for letters of marque by the founding fathers was not merely philosophical consent. Thomas Paine and George Washington both owned stock in privateering ventures.⁴² Additionally, Benjamin Franklin practically ran his own privateering operation while he was assigned to France.⁴³ While most privateering ventures were for money, Franklin used the captured British ships, goods and men to trade for American prisoners of war.⁴⁴\nPrivateering in general weakened an enemy’s economy and its ability to wage war.⁴⁵ The American privateers devastated British commerce, funding the first two years of the war substantially through British captures.⁴⁶ By early 1777, the British had lost 250 ships, resulting in the collapse of several major London-based West India merchant companies.⁴⁷ Within a year, American privateers captured 559 British ships.⁴⁸ Of the approximately 796 British ships captured during the Revolutionary War, American privateers and armed merchant ships accounted for roughly 600.⁴⁹ British merchants, feeling the crippling effect of American privateers,⁵⁰ ensured that “every pressure was brought to bear on Parliament for [the Revolutionary War’s] discontinuance.”⁵¹ Even ships carrying linen from England to Ireland feared the American privateers, to the point of demanding warship escorts.⁵²\nAt the outset of the War of 1812, the British Navy consisted of 1,060 warships. In contrast, the United States Navy had only sixteen, including several that were unfit for sea.⁵³ As a consequence, the United States Navy was not considered to be a serious threat to British naval superiority.⁵⁴ In response, Congress passed a statute authorizing the use of privateers, but tightly controlled them.⁵⁵ The President could revoke, “at pleasure,” any letters of marque he issued after June 1812. The applicant had to list specific details about the ship, crew, and owners, and “Ample security” submitted to ensure compliance with both international and United States law. Further, and perhaps most relevant to modern application, the ship commanders were required to keep a detailed log of everything “that occurs, daily, and transmit them to the government,” and regular United States Navy commanders had to examine these logbooks when “meeting the privateer at sea.”⁵⁶ Failure to abide by these rules would mean forfeiture of the bond and “of all interest in any captures which they may make.”⁵⁷\nWith this new authorization in hand, American privateers wreaked havoc on British shipping and secured victory in America’s second war for independence.⁵⁸ In the process, privateers tallied $39 million in prizes, or roughly $672.5 million in 2012 dollars.⁵⁹\nFollowing the War of 1812, letters of marque did not disappear from the American landscape. President Andrew Jackson, in 1834, discussed the use of letters of marque against France.⁶⁰ Texas, upon declaring independence from Mexico, realized its coast was vulnerable due to a nascent navy. In response, the fledgling Texas legislature began to issue letters of marque with the intent to “protect the coast, harass Mexican shipping, and bring prizes that could be\n⁴¹ Richard, supra note 19, at 437 (citing Letter from Thomas Jefferson, to Gouverneur Morris (Aug. 16, 1793)), in 3 MEMOIR, CORRESPONDENCE AND MISCELLANIES FROM THE PAPERS OF THOMAS JEFFERSON 275 (1829).\n⁴² Tabarrok, supra note 21, at 567.\n⁴³ Id.; see generally WILLIAM BELL CLARK, BEN FRANKLIN’S PRIVATEERS (1956).\n⁴⁴ Tabarrok, supra note 21, at 567.\n⁴⁵ CARL E.

In all, Texas issued six letters of marque.⁶¹ Similarly, President Polk recognized the lawful ability of Mexico to issue letters of marque during the Mexican American War.⁶²\nIn 1856, Britain, France and other titular world powers met in Paris to discuss concerns arising from wartime maritime law.⁶³ France and Great Britain sought to end privateering as they could not effectively control the use of privateers by their enemies, i.e., the United States and Russia.⁶⁴ Great Britain, in particular, recognized privateering as an effective tool of weaker navies that posed a threat to its naval supremacy and sought to contain it.⁶⁵ The result of this meeting was the Paris Declaration of 1856, a document attempting to ban privateering.⁶⁶\nThe Paris Declaration contained three major provisions:⁶⁷ the first provided that “[p]rivateering is, and remains, abolished;” the second prevented the seizing of enemy goods on neutral ships; and the third prevented capture of neutral goods on enemy ships.⁶⁸ Most importantly, the Declaration went to great pains to ensure that its provisions did not apply to any nation save signatories.⁶⁹ This provision is important for two reasons.\nFirst, it made clear that it was not intended to be a universal ban on privateering, as it only applied to signatory nations at war with other signatories.⁷⁰ Second, as stated in the document, it did not have the power to police the actions of non-signatories.⁷¹\nThe United States recognized that this agreement was merely a means for England to maintain maritime supremacy at the expense of nations with a smaller seafaring force, and accordingly, demanded conditions prior to capitulation.⁷² The United States agreed to acquiesce and sign the document only if protection of all non-contraband private property from capture at sea was included.⁷³ The United States reasoned that since all private property is protected on land, “why should it not be [protected] also on the sea?”⁷⁴\nWhile the United States wanted to ensure it would be allowed to trade with both sides of a conflict, free from privateer entanglements, another more vital concern existed. According to Secretary of State William L. Marcy, “the United States could not forgo the right to send out privateers, which in the past had proved her most effective maritime weapon in time of war, and which, since she had no large navy, were essential to her fighting power.”⁷⁵ The United States realized that if privateering was banned, its nascent navy⁷⁶ would be no match for the greater naval might of countries such as Britain and France.⁷⁷ As the plenipotentiaries who signed the Declaration would not adequately address American concerns regarding private goods, and factoring in Marcy’s concern about the resulting unequal balance of naval power, the United States refused to sign the agreement.⁷⁸\nThe issue of privateering arose again in April 1861 when Confederate President Jefferson Davis, with Confederate Congressional approval,⁷⁹ issued letters of\n⁶¹ TEXAS PRIVATEERS, https://www.tsl.state.tx.us/exhibits/navy/privateers.html (last modified Aug. 30, 2011).\n⁶² Although President Polk did take issue with the blank letters of marque issued by Mexico, arguing those were illegal under international law and those acting in accordance with such letters are considered to be pirates.

Perhaps fearing the involvement of the British or French navies in the conflict, the Union declared that it would follow the Declaration and not issue letters of marque and Secretary of State Seward instructed American ambassadors to determine whether the signatories would be amicable to incorporating the proposed changes advocated by Marcy, thus allowing the United States to formally sign the Declaration.⁸¹ As an indication of the Union’s fear of privateers, Secretary Seward authorized acquiescence to the Declaration even if the requested exceptions were not approved.⁸² Britain and France declined the advances and the United States remained a non-signatory.⁸³\nConsequently, the Union passed a statutory authorization for President Lincoln to issue letters of marque⁸⁴ and declared that all attempts to disrupt, capture or destroy Union shipping would be treated as piracy and dealt with as such.⁸⁵ Regardless, the British entered the Civil War as privateers, sailing under letters of marque issued by the Confederacy. In fact, in a case brought by the United States against Britain for damages caused by a privateer, an international tribunal found no issue with a non-signatory (the Confederacy) issuing letters of marque to a signatory (Britain) “to construct, furnish, and crew ships to be used in commerce raids against a non-signatory, the United States.”⁸⁶\nWhen the United States entered into conflict with the Spanish during the Spanish American War, neither the United States nor Spain was a signatory to the Declaration of Paris.⁸⁷ Not only did Spain specifically reserve the right to issue letters of marque,⁸⁸ the Spanish government recognized\nAmerica’s right and ability to issue the same.⁸⁹ The Spanish never carried out the threat, and President McKinley, for the first time, articulated a U.S. intention to comply with the Paris Declaration, though still not be a signatory.⁹⁰\nDespite the reluctance, both Spain and the United States found ways to unofficially authorize privateers without formally issuing letters of marque.⁹¹ Both nations organized “auxiliary cruisers of the Navy.”⁹² The United States Navy chartered private merchant ships, heavily armed them, and subsequently entered into naval service.⁹³ The Navy used the ships and manned them with the owner’s regular, ostensibly civilian crew, placing the ships “under the entire control of the senior naval officer on board.”⁹⁴ One such ship, the City of Paris,⁹⁵ actually took prizes, with the United States Prize Court holding that she was not a “vessel of the Navy nor a privateer . . . ”⁹⁶ and finally ruling that she was an “armed vessel in the service of the United States” and the civilian crew was “entitled as of right to share in the prize money.”⁹⁷\nWhile the nature of privateering changed with the Spanish-American War, privateering did not disappear. At the 1907 Hague Peace Conference, the United States again voiced its opposition to the privateering prohibition.⁹⁸ Specifically, the United States voiced the same concerns as\n⁸⁰ ADAMS, supra note 72, at 141; JAMES D.

Applying Letters of Marque to Cyber Warfare\nLetters of marque were the original “self-help” governmental authorization.¹⁰⁴ While used to great effect in the past, they can now be resurrected and used to achieve similar results, especially in a cyber context. This section addresses the use of a cyber letter of marque in three areas: seizing assets; disrupting, disabling, and dismantling adversarial networks; and conducting cyber bounty hunting and rewards programs.\n## A. Seizing Assets\nIn a modern cyber letter of marque scheme, the U.S. government would authorize certain companies or individuals to track, freeze, and seize the illicit funds of designated criminal organizations. The net effect would be cutting off supplies to deliver the United States from its enemies.¹⁰⁵ For example, the United States has recently named several Russians as “transnational criminals” and promulgated an Executive Order that authorizes “seizure of their assets in the United States and prevents them from banking in dollars anywhere in the world.”¹⁰⁶\nWhen rogue states, such as Iran, contravene the will of the international community, the most used method of ensuring compliance is via the United Nations Security Council or unilateral economic sanctions.¹⁰⁷ The United States first instituted sanctions against Iran in 1979, following the seizure of the American Embassy during the Iranian Revolution. These sanctions included freezing roughly $11 billion in Iranian assets.¹⁰⁸ Iran continues to launder and hide money in contravention of these resolutions, often with the help of international banks.¹⁰⁹ In just one instance, the illicit transactions totaled $250 billion.¹¹⁰ Iran has also turned to China, specifically its banking system, for help in escaping economic sanctions.¹¹¹ Illicit money laundering in contravention of United Nations resolutions is not limited to Iran, but has also included North Korea, Cuba, Sudan, and Mexican criminal cartels.¹¹²\n⁹⁹ See supra Part II.\n¹⁰⁰ CHOATE, supra note 98, at 40.\n¹⁰¹ Id.\n¹⁰² Some have alleged that blimps operated on the west coast of the United States during World War II pursuant to letters of marque. “The Los Angeles based Resolute was the only airship . . . operated for the Navy under privateer status. . . .” JAMES SHOCK &amp; DAVID SMITH, THE GOODYEAR AIRSHIPS 43 (2002).

According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), they report an estimated $1.6 trillion dollars in money laundering in 2009 alone. While U.S. law enforcement has had some success in prosecuting international banks with substantial United States ties, less than one per cent of illegal money is seized globally. Seventy per cent of these illicit funds are funneled through the international banking system. \"[T]racking the flows of illicit funds generated by drug trafficking and organized crime and analyzing how they are laundered through the world's financial systems remain daunting tasks.\" When faced with this exorbitant number, the victories scored by the justice system seem hollow. A cyber letter of marque would allow a privateer to seek these illicit funds wherever they may be hidden and either seize them or digitally sequester them for further law enforcement action. Such a cyber letter of marque brings to bear a formidable resource that will increase the likelihood for seizure of illicit funds and the shutdown of avenues for illicit funding.\nThe idea of using a letter of marque to effect an economic result is not novel. John Adams, in singing the virtues of privateering, said “[I]t is by cutting off supplies, not by attacks, sieges, or assaults, that I expect deliverance from enemies.” While letters of marque during the\nRevolutionary War and the War of 1812 had distinct military objectives, they were \"also a means of commercial warfare conducted for profit.\" Privateers \"were engaged not in patriotic, but business ventures.\" Some privateers amassed great fortunes through their letter of marque commissions, with even the common seaman receiving up to one thousand dollars above his regular wage from just one voyage. The proceeds from captured enemy goods, once sold via the Unites States Prize Courts, were split between the privateer and the sovereign, thus providing a much needed injection of funds to the government and the privateer, while at the same time depriving the enemy of resources.\nMotivated by the possibility of retaining a healthy percentage of the roughly $1.6 trillion presently illicitly laundered worldwide, the number of prospective cyber privateers would be legion. Consequently, the United States government would be in a position to demand an exorbitantly high bond, thus guaranteeing that only the most technically proficient and responsible cyber privateers would seek the commission. As for the cyber profiteer, the prospect of sharing a large percentage of the trillions of dollars, not to mention the potential for criminal or tort liability, would ensure strict compliance with the terms of the letter of marque. As the privateer in the 1700s and 1800s provided both a much needed governmental funding stream and served a valid national security function, so too would a modern cyber privateer by removing illicit funds from the hands of organized crime and sanction violators. The end result would be a potential death blow to crime organizations and rogue regimes.\nCurrently, the law restricts anyone from attempting to seize assets, whether they belong to the most deplorable rogue regime or the most vicious drug cartel.

Disrupting, Disabling, and Dismantling Adversarial Networks\nIn December 2012, a cybercriminal known as “vorVzakone”¹²⁷ announced Project Blitzkrieg, wherein he¹²⁸ planned to attack 30 Unites States banks in an attempt to steal money from accounts belonging to the “rich.”¹²⁹ McAfee Labs, a leading computer security company,¹³⁰ determined that this “is a credible threat to the financial industry and appears to be moving forward as planned.”¹³¹ The projected losses from the announced attack could reach “hundreds of millions of dollars.”¹³² The targets of the planned attack included Bank of America, Capitol One, Suntrust, Ameritrade, eTrade, and Fidelity and Schwab.¹³³ From April to December 2012, vorVzakone claimed at least 500 cyber victims.¹³⁴\nAt roughly the same time that the U.S. banking industry began to deal with vorVzakone, bank officials were contending with cyber attacks emanating from Iran.¹³⁵ The attack’s complexities are comparable to that of “a pack of fire-breathing Godzillas.”¹³⁶ In fact, the internet traffic used in the attacks has been “multiple times” the number that Russia allegedly directed or encouraged at Estonia in a month-long online assault in 2007 that nearly crippled the\n¹²⁷ Literally translated means “thief in law.” See KREBS ON SECURITY, New Findings Lend Credence to Project Blitzkrieg, http://krebsonsecurity.com/tag/vorvzakone-gozi-prinimalku/ (last visited Dec. 12, 2012).\n¹²⁸ While the exact identity of vorKzakone is unknown, he is believed to be a male, as shown by alleged photographs of vorKzakone online.

As discussed previously,¹⁵⁴ American privateers disrupted English commerce to such an extent that several London-based firms went bankrupt.¹⁵⁵ British merchants,\ntheir livelihoods so disrupted and, in fact, disabled, put pressure on their own government to end the war and allow the Americans to have their independence.¹⁵⁶ The financial toll on the enemy during the War of 1812 by American privateers was staggering, which in turn had the operative effect of weakening both British naval superiority and morale in England. If privateering proved to be such an effective defensive weapon in a naval context, it can certainly be used in a cyber context where disrupting an enemy’s attack can be done through a keyboard by a handful of individuals instead of through fourteen-gun warships manned by over a hundred crewmen.¹⁵⁷\n## C. Cyber Bounty Hunting\nThe realm of cyber letters of marque is not limited to offensive or defensive actions in the classic sense. A cyber letter of marque could also be utilized as a method of bounty hunting, providing information to law enforcement agencies necessary to apprehend a cyber attacker.\nBounty hunting, like a letter of marque, is an activity intertwined with the history of the United States. The United States Supreme Court endorsed bounty hunting as a legal activity in the 1872 case *Taylor v. Taintor*.¹⁵⁸ The federal government endorsed, and continues to endorse, bounty hunting for capture (as opposed to kill) as exemplified in the most wanted lists.¹⁵⁹ Perhaps most famously, the United\n¹⁴⁶ Bardin, *supra* note 13.\n¹⁴⁷ *Id.*; Jody Westby, *Caution: Active Response to Cyber Attacks Has High Risk*, FORBES.COM, Nov. 29, 2012, http://www.forbes.com/sites/jodywestby/2012/11/29/caution-active-response-to-cyber-attacks-has-high-risk/.\n¹⁴⁸ *N.

They may exercise their rights in person or by agent. They may pursue him into another State; may arrest him on the Sabbath; and, if necessary, may break and enter his house for that purpose.

This, arguably, would be illegal under current United States law.¹⁷⁰\nThe Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) serves as a barrier to a corporation or individual¹⁷¹ from coming to the aid of a cyber-attack victim. Congress could carefully draft cyber letter of marquee legislation authorizing such entities to track and digitally “capture” a cyber criminal or terrorist. The only difference between the reward/bounty programs currently operated by the United States Government and a cyber letter of marque is the antiquated CFAA prohibition.\nIndeed, other scholars have posited the use of bounty hunting letters of marque.¹⁷² For example, Robert P. DeWitte, writing in the Indiana Law Journal, discussed one of the potential downfalls between physical, as opposed to virtual, bounty hunting through the use of a letter of marque. In particular, he illuminated the legitimate concern that “state authorities could conceivably attempt to capture and/or kill privateers” in their territory while operating under a valid U.S. letter of marque.¹⁷³ However, this concern in a cyber letter of marque context is not applicable since the cyber privateer/bounty hunter would be safely ensconced in the territorial United States, outside the physical reach of an unfriendly foreign armed force.\nJust as letters of marque are constitutional,¹⁷⁴ so too are bounties, as over a hundred years of U.S. jurisprudence demonstrates.¹⁷⁵ The issuance of a cyber letter of marque\n¹⁶⁹ See, e.g., NAT’L ASS’N FUGITIVE RECOVERY AGENTS (N.A.F.R.A.), http://fugitive-recovery.org/ (last visited Dec. 24, 2012); NAT’L ASS’N BAIL BOND INVESTIGATORS, http://nabbi.org/ (last visited Dec. 24, 2012).\n¹⁷⁰ The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1030 (2006), would most likely prevent a company or individual from taking these steps.

A cyber letter of marque would allow a cyber privateer access to those established and protected legal mechanisms.\n## IV. Legal Barriers\nDespite the many potential applications of a cyber letter of marque, some arguments raise concerns about the legality of its application. When discussing letters of marque, most commentators cite to the same alleged legal barriers to implementation: domestic law, usually the CFAA; the Law of Armed Conflict, specifically attribution and self-defense concerns; the Paris Declaration of 1856; and the Council of Europe Convention on Cyber-crime. This section examines each of these areas and analyzes why they are not legal barriers to the implementation of a cyber letter of marque regime.\n### A. The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act\nThe Computer Fraud and Abuse Act,¹⁷⁷ initially a criminal statute protecting government computers and those computers belonging to entities with compelling government interests,¹⁷⁸ forces companies under attack to “just stand and take a beating.”¹⁷⁹ Since its passage in 1984, it has expanded¹⁸⁰ to include civil liability by prohibiting anyone from “intentionally access[ing] a protected computer without authorization or exceed[ing] authorized access . . . [and recklessly causing damage¹⁸¹ involving a loss¹⁸² of] at least\n$5,000 in value.”¹⁸³ The definition of a “protected computer” has expanded to cover not only U.S. government computers, but also any computer “used in a manner that affects interstate or foreign commerce.”¹⁸⁴ Even those computers located outside the United States are protected.¹⁸⁵ Potentially, every single computer connected to the internet anywhere in the world would be a “protected computer” pursuant to the CFAA,¹⁸⁶ including, potentially, a blue-tooth-enabled garage door opener or coffeemaker in suburbia.¹⁸⁷\nWhile the CFAA prohibits the mere access to a protected computer, causing damage seems to be the lynchpin to triggering civil and criminal penalties under the CFAA. Some courts have homed in on the damage requirement, refusing to find civil or criminal liability. For example, in *Moulton v. VC3*,¹⁸⁸ the court held that an unauthorized port scan and throughput test of a defendant’s servers is not a violation of the CFAA¹⁸⁹ since no “damage” was caused. Likewise, in *United States v. Czubinski*,¹⁹⁰ the court reversed the criminal conviction of an IRS agent who accessed a “protected computer” to satisfy his curiosity.¹⁹¹\nWhile some of the judicial decisions seem to allow some degree of cyber intelligence collection under the current regulatory scheme,¹⁹² the courts clearly would not allow an entity to seize assets, whether they are being laundered at a major international bank or if information leading to their location is on a drug kingpin’s desktop\n¹⁷⁶ 31 U.S.C. §§ 3729–3733 (2006).\n¹⁷⁷ 18 U.S.C. § 1030 (2006).\n¹⁷⁸ This included not only government computers and networks, but also those of large banks, the New York Stock Exchange, etc. Robert B.

Consequently, government authorization would first be a necessity.¹⁹³\nDespite allowing for criminal and civil penalties, the CFAA is not an effective means of preventing cyber attacks.¹⁹⁴ Some have argued that active-defense authorizations, such as a letter of marque, are not necessary as the cyber victim can turn over evidence of a cyber attack to the FBI for prosecution.¹⁹⁵ While this might work in theory, in actual practice it leaves the cyber victim virtually remediless for a host of reasons. For one, law enforcement personnel are questionably competent when it comes to cyber attacks and cyber crime.¹⁹⁶ Further, due to the global nature of cyber attacks, an American court might have a difficult time bringing a cyber attacker within its jurisdiction.¹⁹⁷ Even if a cyber attack victim captures all the information necessary to conduct a thorough law enforcement investigation, the FBI has bungled such gift-wrapped cyber cases in the past.¹⁹⁸\nJust as cyber criminals are capable of seizing money from an individual’s bank accounts,¹⁹⁹ cyber companies with the technical expertise can track down and seize illicit funds, given the proper governmental authorization. A cyber letter of marque would provide such authorization.\n## B. Attribution and Self-Defense\nAttribution is the legal requirement to positively identify the attacker prior to responding with force in self-defense.²⁰⁰ How does a prospective cyber privateer ensure it is striking the proper target²⁰¹ and how does a cyber-privateer cover their tracks so as to not entice further attacks? Admittedly, discovering the source of a cyber attack is “the most important aspect of active defense.”²⁰² It necessarily must be a requirement when issuing a cyber letter of marque to ensure that the privateer is targeting the proper bad actor. Critics have complained that it is too difficult to identify the attacker with sufficient accuracy to ensure a counter-attack is accurately aimed.²⁰³ While tracing an attack may not provide actionable results, and some technologies “limit the ability to make perfect surgical strikes with active defense,”²⁰⁴ the problem may not be as big as it appears. Some speculate that it is more difficult for the bad actor to identify the cyber privateer than it is for the cyber privateer to identify the bad actor.²⁰⁵\nThe attribution concerns may, however, be a bit overblown.²⁰⁶ Even the Russian cyber attacks launched or encouraged against Estonia could be traced back to the “Russian intelligence apparatus.”²⁰⁷ In fact, “attribution to at least some level will almost always be possible.”²⁰⁸ While the exact technologies available to ensure accurate attribution, which can be done in seconds, are not the focus of this paper, such technology is not new and “is currently the subject of a significant amount of research aimed at improving accuracy and efficiency.”²⁰⁹ While it may not be feasible, or even possible, to accurately attribute 100 million cyber attacks,²¹⁰ “it is clear that the current state of the\n¹⁹³ See, e.g., NRC REPORT, supra note 18 (discussing the exemption for lawfully authorized law enforcement and intelligence agencies activities to the CFAA and how government agencies may commandeer private computes or pay for their usage).\n¹⁹⁴ See supra Part I (discussing of the frequency of cyber attacks). The CFAA, in one form or another, has been in effect since 1984. It has had little to no affect on cyber attacks.\n¹⁹⁵ See, e.g., Westby, supra note 147.\n¹⁹⁶ Ms. Westby, while arguing a cyber victim should turn over information to law enforcement instead of proactively defending themselves, admits that “there are too few of them with skills adequate to match the sophisticated nature of today’s cyber criminals.” Id. Others have agreed with her assessment that there are too few cyber-competent law enforcement officers.

Paris Declaration of 1856\nMost critics of the letter of marque, regardless of its application, usually point to the Paris Declaration of 1856, noting that the United States is prohibited from employing privateers due to the agreement.²¹² This argument, however, is without merit.\nFirst, the Declaration does not apply to the United States per the plain language of the treaty. “The present Declaration is not and shall not be binding, except between those Powers who have acceded, or shall accede, to it.”²¹³ The United States did not accede to it in 1856 and has not, in the ensuing 157 years, acceded to it. Under the rules of treaty interpretation,²¹⁴ a treaty is binding only upon parties to it,²¹⁵ and it “does not create either obligations or rights for a third State without its consent.”²¹⁶ Further, in order to impose an obligation on a third State, it must “expressly accept that obligation in writing.”²¹⁷ To date, the United States has not consented to the obligations of the Declaration in writing, as required by the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.\nAdditionally, the Declaration clearly pertains, and limits itself, to maritime law.²¹⁸ Since a cyber letter of marque regime is not grounded in maritime law and letters of marque are specifically authorized in the United States Constitution, it is permissible under international law, Paris Declaration notwithstanding, to issue cyber letters of marque.\nOthers argue²¹⁹ that the Declaration has become customary international law.²²⁰ While this might be true at first blush, it ignores the legal and historical fact. A nation, not otherwise bound by a treaty, does not become bound by operation of the rule of customary international law if it has been a persistent objector. In order to be considered a persistent objector, and therefore not bound by a treaty, the State “must have objected to the emergence of a new norm during its formation and continue to object afterwards.”²²¹ Even if it has been state practice to follow the precepts in a treaty, non-signatory states can alter their actions in order to confront new threats.²²²\nRegarding the Declaration of Paris, the United States objected during the formation of the proposed privateering ban²²³ and objected to the Declaration by passing legislation authorizing privateers during the Civil War;²²⁴ the Spanish government recognized America’s right to issue letters of marque during the Spanish-American War,²²⁵ and voiced opposition at the 1907 Hague Peace Conference.²²⁶ Clearly, the United States has been a persistent objector to the Declaration and thus not bound by it. Simply stated, American privateering declined not because of acquiescence to international treaties which it did not, and had no intent to, sign. Rather, privateering declined because America, after 1898, no longer had a nascent navy, had become a major\nAUGUST 2013 • THE ARMY LAWYER • DA PAM 27-50-483\nnaval power,²²⁷ and the “cost-saving advantages of privateering [had] declined.”²²⁸\nAssuming, *arguendo*, that the Paris Declaration is customary international law that the United States must follow, the issuance of cyber letters of marque is still not banned. The Declaration never defines privateers.²²⁹ As history demonstrates, a contracted civilian ship can be armed, staffed with civilians, fight, and take prizes—all without violating the Declaration.²³⁰\n## D. The Council of Europe Convention on Cyber-Crime²³¹\nOn 23 November 2001, the United States signed on to the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime.²³² The Cybercrime Convention came into effect in the United States on 1 January 2007.²³³ The Cybercrime Convention’s main objective “is to pursue a common criminal policy aimed at the protection of society against cyber-crime, especially by adopting appropriate legislation and fostering international co-operation.”²³⁴ It purports to allow countries to work together through substantive, procedural, and jurisdictional laws against a cyber criminal committing crimes in one country while physically located in another.²³⁵ Prior to the Cybercrime Convention (and some would argue even today),²³⁶ the cyber police forces in the United States or internationally did not have the tools or authority necessary to combat cyber-attacks. Additionally, it did not address the\ncultural issues that may arise from crimes committed in cyberspace.²³⁷ To make matters worse, some countries did not have adequate laws against cyber-crime.²³⁸\nAn attempt to correct these law enforcement deficiencies was the impetus for the creation of the Cybercrime Convention. It remains the only international treaty attempting to deal with the issue of transcontinental cyber attacks.²³⁹ It fails, however, to effectively protect anyone from cyber attacks. It is largely a symbolic document, serving mainly to reassure the public that governments are doing *something* to address the threat.²⁴⁰ Those reassurances are hollow, as only roughly half of the ratifying states have passed domestic legislation required to enforce the document.²⁴¹\nRemarkably, the exceptions contained in the Cybercrime Convention negate its impact. First, no requirement exists that any cyber attacker actually be prosecuted; instead, the State must merely “report the final outcome to the requesting Party [i.e., the cyber victim’s nation] in due course.”²⁴² In addition, nearly every enforcement provision of the Cybercrime Convention contains a legislative flaw, allowing a nation state to refuse to cooperate.²⁴³ A nation may refuse a request for assistance during or after a cyber attack emanating from its country for a host of reasons. These reasons include, but are not limited to²⁴⁴: if a request for assistance would violate domestic laws,²⁴⁵ if a request for assistance and information gained\nAUGUST 2013 • THE ARMY LAWYER • DA PAM 27-50-483\ntherefrom could be used in any investigation or court proceedings other than those listed in the request,²⁴⁶ or if an attacked nation believes there are political issues at play.²⁴⁷\nPerhaps as a sign of the naïve belief that the feckless Cybercrime Convention will actually curb cyber attacks, the Council of Europe’s Committee of Experts on Terrorism opined in February 2010 that no further conventions are needed to address cyber terrorism because “large scale attacks on computer systems appeared to be already covered by the Cybercrime Convention.”²⁴⁸ Yet two days later, on 18 February 2010, The Washington Post broke the story that more than 75,000 computers and roughly 2,500 companies in the United States, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Turkey, and Mexico were victims of “one of the largest and most sophisticated attacks by cyber criminals discovered to date.”²⁴⁹ The attack began in 2008 and was not discovered until January 2010.²⁵⁰\nIn the United States, an unnamed Department of Justice official purportedly alleged that the “impact of the convention [is] ‘very positive,’” which, again, seems to ignore the reality of cyber attack’s scope.²⁵¹ To the contrary, the Cybercrime Convention seems to merely limit the ability of a law-abiding entity to take proactive steps necessary to cease a cyber threat.²⁵²\nBecause the Cybercrime Convention does not diminish cyber attacks, lacks any enforcement or prosecution mechanism and expressly states that signatory states pass domestic criminal laws covering “illegal access,”²⁵³ “illegal interception,”²⁵⁴ criminal “misuse of devices,”²⁵⁵ [emphasis added], the United States is not prevented from issuing letters of marque. If Congress exercised its constitutionally authorized power to issue letters of marque, limited to cyber operations, no violation of any provision of the Convention would occur because no domestic criminal acts occur.\nEven the U.S. Attorney General stated, in 2006, that the Cybercrime Convention “is in full accord with all U.S. Constitutional protections.”²⁵⁶ The activity undertaken pursuant to a constitutionally authorized and congressionally endorsed cyber letter of marque would not, under United States law, be illegal and thus not a violation of any provision contained in the Cybercrime Convention. In short, a cyber letter of marque issued by Congress would not violate the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime.\n## V. Authorizations and Oversight\nWhile a cyber letter of marque is legal, both under domestic and international law, any cyber letter of marque regime must provide for a method of authorizing and subsequently supervising a cyber privateer. This section discusses some potential methods of authorization and oversight necessary for an effective cyber letter of marque regime.\n## A. Issuance of Bonds and Authorizations\nPrior to the issuance of a letter of marque, all prospective cyber privateers should be required to register with a central governmental database. This database would provide the supervising agency²⁵⁷ with a means of not only policing cyber privateers and holding them accountable, but also a means for parties allegedly aggrieved by United States authorized cyber privateers to seek redress. Such a database and registration would also allow the supervisory agency an opportunity to vet the putative cyber privateer. “If a company does not have the skills to defend its systems, it likely does not have the skills to attack back—or make\nAUGUST 2013 • THE ARMY LAWYER • DA PAM 27-50-483\n246 This provision, in effect, means that if the information leads to more criminals, and a nation wants to prosecute them, it may not use this information in that investigation/prosecution. The nation must start over in the investigative process as it relates to the newly discovered bad actors. *Id.* art. 28.\n247 *Id.* art. 27.\n248 VATIS, *supra* note 242, at 219 (quoting Council of Europe Committee of Experts on Terrorism (CODEXTER), Opinion of the Committee of Experts on Terrorism (CODEXTER) for the Attention of the Committee of Ministers on Cyber terrorism and Use of Internet for Terrorist Purposes).\n249 Ellen Nakashima, *More Than 75,000 Computer Systems Hacked in One of Largest Cyber Attacks, Security Firm Says*, WASH POST, Feb. 18, 2010, http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/02/17/AR2010021705816.html.\n250 *Id.*\n251 VATIS, *supra* note 242, at 209 (quoting an unnamed U.S. Dep’t of Justice official).\n252 As Bardin states:\nDo we really think that establishing a convention on cyber crime is going to stop our adversaries? They do not recognize our virtual boards or virtual sovereignty as it is. Why would they recognize a convention on cyber crime? All this does is force offensive cyber forces to establish an unwieldy ‘rules of engagement’ that ties the hands of those who can execute offensive cyber actions.\nBardin, *supra* note 13.\n253 *Id.* ch. II, art. 2.\n254 *Id.* art. 3.\n255 *Id.* ch. II, art. 6.\n256 Statement of Alberto Gonzales, Attorney General for the U.S., on the Passage of the Cybercrime Convention (Aug. 4, 2006), available at http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2006/August/06_sg_499.html (emphasis added).\n257 Whether it is a congressional sub-committee, the NSA, DHS, etc.\ndecisions about whether to engage in such actions.”²⁵⁸ If the applicant does not possess the requisite skills, then its request for a cyber letter of marque is denied.²⁵⁹\nFurther, all applicants must be able to post a bond commensurate with potential liability exposure. “Letters of marque should only be issued to security firms able to post a significant bond and meet specific qualification and training requirements.”²⁶⁰ The bond requirement is the most effective method for screening out “start-ups” and “fly-by-night” security companies from seeking a letter of marque.²⁶¹ The Act Concerning Letters-of-Marque, Prizes &amp; Prize Goods specifically states that before the issuance of any commission of letters of marque, a bond in the amount of five thousand dollars, or ten thousand dollars if the ship had more than one hundred and fifty men, would have to be paid by two “responsible sureties, not interested in such vessel.”²⁶² The payment of such a steep bond ensures that privateers strictly adhere to congressional rules.²⁶³\nIn a cyber context, since the stakes are so high, a prospective cyber privateer should be required to supply a large monetary bond.²⁶⁴ A large monetary bond would not only ensure that responsible entities apply for and receive cyber letters of marque, but also that those with the requisite discretion and technical expertise are the only ones acting with congressional authority as a cyber privateer. The prime importance of competent exercise of the powers enumerated in the letter of marque is underscored when the vast amount of money and intellectual property lost on a frequent and recurring basis, coupled with the exacting nature of establishing positive identification, especially attribution, is contemplated. A large monetary bond would, in effect, keep the cyber cutthroats out of this business.\nSingapore established CaseTrust, a similar system, in order to protect consumers engaged in e-commerce. CaseTrust receives complaints against e-vendors and legitimizes member companies. Prior to joining, a\nprospective e-vendor must give a banker’s guarantee, or a bond, to establish that it is indeed a legitimate and reputable company. The CaseTrust system provides for compulsory adjudication including the power to not only fine a vendor, but also to revoke its certification. As a result, the consumer is protected by providing a source of bonded companies and a policing mechanism. Additionally, the commercial entities are shrouded with governmental legitimacy. To date, enforcement has been effective and participation is growing.²⁶⁵\nIn a historical context, the putative privateer kept detailed daily logs, which were available for inspection by any U.S. naval commander he might encounter.²⁶⁶ Similar requirements would be made of cyber privateers. As all internet activity can be, or actually is, easily monitored,²⁶⁷ this requirement does not place too onerous a burden on the purported cyber privateer. While most private companies are loathe to share details of their cyber activity for fear of losing intellectual property, a competitive edge, or disclose their cyber defenses or weaknesses,²⁶⁸ a company serious about executing a defensive or even offensive cyber letter of marque should be willing to accept the more stringent scrutiny, such as reviewing cyber logbooks.\nA cyber letter of marque would designate the bearers to be licensed combatants for the sovereign, authorizing them to “bear arms” in the cyber sense of the word, and either defend against specific attacks and launch counter attacks (back-backs) or engage in offensive cyber operations directed at sovereign selected targets or networks.²⁶⁹ A private company could be granted authorization to conduct a hack-back, temporarily incapacitating a cyber bad actor, and then notify the appropriate law enforcement or national security entity for final apprehension or network termination.²⁷⁰\nAUGUST 2013 • THE ARMY LAWYER • DA PAM 27-50-483\nIn recognition that cyber privateers would, to a certain extent, be bearing arms, a workable set of rules of engagement would necessarily be a major part of the actual commission. Professor Susan Brenner has expressed concerns that cyber privateers could be motivated to vigilantism and exceed the bounds of their charter, exhibiting an inability to determine who is a just target.²⁷¹ These concerns can be easily alleviated by carefully drafted rules of engagement and scope of authorization in the letter of marque commission itself. If cyber privateers exceed the scope of the commission, they lose their substantial bond, face debarment from future government contracts, and open themselves up to potential criminal prosecutions since their actions were outside the scope of the immunity granted by the letter of marque. These adverse ramifications should keep a vetted and approved cyber privateer in line.\n## B. Legal and Judicial Oversight\nThe legal framework for a workable letter of marque regime already exists under current federal law.²⁷² “Privateering worked only because it was backed by a substantial system of law, not only the common law of property, but also the statutory creations such as admiralty courts and bond requirements.”²⁷³ The federal judiciary is vested with original jurisdiction to determine prizes,²⁷⁴ burdens of proof established,²⁷⁵ the due process rights of both the captor and the captive duly considered,²⁷⁶ and the\nsecuritylaw.us/2012/11/30/steven-chabinsky-crowdstrike-ex-fbi-cyber-division-talks-pprivate-sector-cyberdeterrence-at-abas-natsec-law-conference/.\n²⁷¹ Brenner, supra note 212.\n²⁷² See, e.g., Commissioning Private Vessels for Seizure of Piratical Vessels, 33 U.S.C. § 386 (2006).\nThe President is authorized to instruct the commanders of the public armed vessels of the United States, and to authorize the commanders of any other armed vessels sailing under the authority of any letters of marquee and reprisal granted by Congress, or the commanders of any other suitable vessels, to subdue, seize, take, and, if on the high seas, to send into any port of the United States, any vessel or boat built, purchased, fitted out, or held as mentions in 33 U.S.C. § 385.\nId.\n²⁷³ Tabarrok, supra note 21, at 572.\n²⁷⁴ Jurisdiction, 10 U.S.C. § 7652 (2006).\n²⁷⁵ See The Resolution, 2 U.S. 19 (U.S. 1781) (holding that the burden of proving a prize was captured lawfully lies with the captors).\n²⁷⁶ The legality of a capture is not determined until a court of competent jurisdiction has issued an order making such a determination. Id. Whether property seized may be confiscated as a prize is a judicial question and each case is to be decided on its own facts. Property Captured by the Potomac Flotilla, 10 Op. Att’y Gen. 467 (1863).\ninterests of the United States represented by a duly appointed authority in the “United States attorney for the district in which the prize cause is adjudicated.”²⁷⁷ In fact, Chapter 655 of 10 U.S.C. contains the entire statutory framework to judicially administer a letter of marque regime.\nHistorical precedence demonstrates that judicial oversight is an effective means to monitor and police privateers. For example, the court invalidated the first two prizes claimed during the War of 1812 because of improperly issued letters of marque.²⁷⁸ Even the venerable USS Constitution was also involved in an illegitimate capture, a situation embarrassingly rectified by the courts.²⁷⁹ Indeed, a rich legal history of privateering cases exists before the United States Supreme Court.²⁸⁰\nSome are concerned that the government would not be able to control the behavior of modern privateers, especially in a cyber context.²⁸¹ In reality, these concerns are easily addressed with stiff consequences.²⁸² Penalties can include forfeiture of the bond and any pay due as a result of a successful capture or mission, seizure of assets,²⁸³ debarment from all future government contracts,²⁸⁴ exclusion from future letter of marque commissions, criminal prosecution, and potential tort liability.²⁸⁵\nAt least two presidents proposed criminal prosecution for misuse of a letter of marque. President Jefferson, a major proponent of privateering during the Revolutionary War,²⁸⁶ declared that individuals operating off the coast without valid commissions be captured and tried as pirates.²⁸⁷\n²⁷⁷ Duties of United States Attorney, 10 U.S.C.A. § 7656 (2012).\n²⁷⁸ Tabarrok, supra note 21, at 568.\n²⁷⁹ The United States paid the owners of the captured ship $11,000 in damages. PETRIE, supra note 122, at 160.\n²⁸⁰ See, e.g., In re The Amiable Isabella, Munos, 19 U.S. 1 (1821); The Adeline, 9 Cranch 244 (1815); The Amy Warwick, 67 U.S. 635 (1862).\n²⁸¹ Brenner, supra note 212.\n²⁸² Richard, supra note 19, at 455.\n²⁸³ In a cyber context, this could include all computers and network capabilities.\n²⁸⁴ 48 C.F.R. §§ 9.406–406-05, (2012).\n²⁸⁵ See The Santissima Trinidad, 20 U.S. 283 (1822) (holding that illegal privateers, whether public or private, “are tortuous—and the original owner is entitled to restitution when brought within our jurisdiction”). Tort liability has real teeth, as government is generally immune from civil suit, whereas a letter of marque holder would not be. See David A. Sklansky, The Private Police, 46 UCLA L. REV. 1165, 1186 (1999); Richard, supra note 19, at 455.\n²⁸⁶ See supra Part II.\n²⁸⁷ UPTON, supra note 57, at 180.\nAUGUST 2013 • THE ARMY LAWYER • DA PAM 27-50-483\nPresident Lincoln made a similar proclamation regarding privateers hired by the Confederate States, as he did not believe the “rebellious” states had legal authority to issue letters of marque.²⁸⁸\nAccording to some scholars, one of the major drawbacks of the traditional letter of marque system was the lack of organization or unified command, control and communication.²⁸⁹ To address this concern, all cyber letter of marque holders would report their activities and progress to a central authority on a regular and recurring basis.²⁹⁰ This central authority would have the ability to terminate the cyber privateer’s commission and/or refer the matter to the Department of Justice for criminal prosecution, should the commissioner act outside the bounds of authority. As this central authority would have an over-arching view of which cyber privateers were acting in which arenas, they could deconflict any possible issues of interrupting law enforcement, intelligence, or national security operations in cyber space. Additionally, purely governmental agencies, such as the National Security Agency, would then be in a better position to work in concert with the cyber privateers to execute specific targeted operations.²⁹¹\n## VI. Conclusion\n“More destructive cyber weapons are being created every day . . . [eventually] . . . those who mean to harm the United States will gain the ability to launch a damaging attack. The United States must develop stronger defenses before this occurs.”²⁹² Despite this threat, the U.S. government seems to be content with merely allowing network owners to “[sit] there . . . trying to swat away these intrusions.”²⁹³ Industry experts have specifically asked that Congress “provide opportunities and responsibilities to the private sector to hack back.”²⁹⁴\nPerhaps in tacit acknowledgement that the private sector is better prepared to handle cyber issues, the United States Air Force solicits private industry for capabilities designed to “destroy, deny, degrade, disrupt, deceive, corrupt, or usurp the adversaries [sic] ability to use the cyberspace domain for his advantage.”²⁹⁵\nAdditionally, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DAPRA), through its “Plan X,” sought “innovative research proposals” in an effort to “dominate the cyber battle space.”²⁹⁶ Congress has not only denied these requests, while at the same time ignoring the Air Force and DARPA’s proposed use of private industry, but at the same time tied their hands with respect to possible civil and criminal liability.²⁹⁷ Members of Congress have instead suggested legislative mandates requiring “owners and operators of vital infrastructure [to] better protect networks,” or even tax credits as a means of encouraging corporations to establish stricter cyber security safeguards.²⁹⁸ Congress has failed to provide industry with the tools they are desperately asking for: a means in which to protect themselves in a meaningful way.\nPolitical policy makers must understand that “[i]n cyberspace, the offense has the upper hand” and the nation cannot remain secure while hiding behind a mythical all protective firewall.²⁹⁹ Accordingly, Congress should exercise its constitutional authority and authorize the\n22\nAUGUST 2013 • THE ARMY LAWYER • DA PAM 27-50-483\nissuance of cyber letters of marque and allow American entities to actively defend themselves in cyber space.\nAs delineated above, the letter of marque has a rich tradition, not only in international and maritime law, but also in American history. Were it not for this power, the United States might not ever have gained her freedom, much less secured it in the War of 1812.³⁰⁰ The United States justly refused to acquiesce to a ban on privateering and that ban is not binding to this day.³⁰¹ As advanced in this article, a cyber letter of marque can, with adequate safeguards in place,³⁰² protect our current infrastructure, obtain information on emerging threats, and then eliminate such threats. Taking into account the current state of the law and\nthe restrictions that prevent an adequate method of cyber self-defense, it becomes clear that a well thought out cyber letter of marque scheme would be able to address the fears that led to the enactment of the CFAA.\nThe current legal framework allows hackers to do what they please,³⁰³ while network owners must follow onerous statutory rules.³⁰⁴ The issuance of cyber letters of marque is a constitutionally authorized method of self-defense Congress should authorize to level the cyber playing field.\n³⁰⁰ “Historian Faye M. Kert offers the judgment that ‘without the presence of the American privateers in the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812, the United States would never have been able to hold off the British Navy.’” SECHREST, supra note 31, at 7.\n³⁰¹ See infra Part III.\n³⁰² This addresses the emotional and intellectually dishonest reactions of “vigilante justice in cyberspace . . . notions of pirates on the high seas and wild west posses” as voiced by people such as Jim Richards of Tangent Capital. Egan, supra note 293.\n³⁰³ Some complain that to allow active-defense, cyberspace would devolve into a “wild west.” (“Allowing companies an exception to the CFAA really would turn the Internet into the Wild West.”). Westby, supra note 147.\nIt is in many ways the Wild West. Cyberspace has many similarities to a Wild West world . . . The message of this metaphor for cyberspace security is clear: If there is no way to enforce law and order throughout all of cyberspace, which appears to be the case, one must rely on local enclaves of law and order, and trusted friends.\nRICHARD O. HUNDLEY &amp; ROBERT H. ANDERSON, EMERGING CHALLENGE SECURITY AND SAFETY IN CYBERSPACE 12, reprinted from IEEE TECHNOLOGY AND SOCIETY MAGAZINE (1995/1996). International scholars have also recognized the Wild West nature of the internet. See Richard de Silva, Cyber Law: Navigating the Legalities of Digital Weapons, CYBER DEF. &amp; NETWORK SECURITY, Oct. 2012.\n³⁰⁴ “It’s unfair that hackers can do whatever they want and companies have to follow rules . . .” said Ronen Kenig, director of security product marketing at Radware.” Egan, supra note 293.\nAUGUST 2013 • THE ARMY LAWYER • DA PAM 27-50-483"

Kessinger* ## I. Introduction At any given time, millions upon millions of people connect to each other via cyberspace.¹ While a convenient method for grandparents to view pictures of their grandchildren, the Internet is also an exceedingly effective vehicle by which to attack a state, a company, or an individual. These attacks occur with frightening frequency, over 1,000 per hour in Great Britain alone²; and Britain recognizes the severity of the cyber threat.³ In the first four days of the November 2012 fighting between Israel and Gaza militants, over 44 million attacks on Israeli websites⁴ and an estimated 100 million total attacks occurred.⁵ Cyber-attacks cost Australia “an average of $2 million per incident” and exceed a billion dollars per year.⁶ Successful attacks also occur against international bodies, such as the International Atomic Energy Agency.⁷ These cyber attacks seek not only military targets, but also industrial espionage.⁸ Despite the frequency and increasing severity of cyber attacks,⁹ many governments and industries around the world, to include the United States, are either seemingly helpless against the cyber onslaught,¹⁰ too dysfunctional¹¹ to create a useful offensive or defensive cyber scheme,¹² or are “highly immature with limited vision and strategic foresight.”¹³ Some foreign jurisdictions, our allies¹⁴ in the fight against cyber-attacks, fail to stem the tide of these attacks and now punish the cyber victims.¹⁵ This article explores the improbable, if not politically impossible, application of the letter of marque concept to the cyber arena. Despite the likely political stigma such a proposition would have in today’s Congress, letters of marque are nevertheless a constitutional and valid tool to execute cyber operations, and thus worthy of discussion.\nProposed defenses to cyber attacks are becoming increasingly complex and bizarre.¹⁶ However, one * U.S. Army, Judge Advocate.

Militarily, the government retains control over the letter of marque holder (a\"privateer\") and responsibilities as delineated within the express terms of the letter of marque while at the same time broadening the military's reach. As a law enforcement tool, a letter of marque deputizes an individual or company, thus vesting that entity with police powers. This authority allows the privateer to detain targets, bring them before the sovereign, and receive compensation based on successes, much like a bounty hunter. Using civilian forces in a military/national defense context is not a concept limited to antiquity. For example, monitored non-governmental civilian participation in governmental operations exists with private military contractors. The United States spent over $300 billion on military contractors from 2001–2007.\nThere is an apparent aversion to the use of letter of marque and privateers. Various bills introduced throughout the years proposing the revival of letter of marque have stalled or failed outright. Despite the hesitation, letters of marque and privateers served a legitimate military purpose, both in supplementing regular combat forces and crippling enemy commerce while protecting American commerce. A cyber letter of marque would enable a privateer to seize digital assets, disrupt fiscal and communication networks, destroy attacking networks, and act as a cyber bounty hunter.\nApplying a letter of marque scheme to the cyber world would not only provide authority for American companies to defend themselves from cyber threats, but also allow them to take proactive measures to neutralize a cyber threat before it coalesces into danger. In addition to providing requisite authorization, a letter of marque scheme would regulate the conduct of a prospective cyber privateer and ensure accountability to effect compliance with the letter of marque's mandate.\nPart II of this article examines the historical usage of letters of marque and privateers. A brief historical discussion shows the use of letters of marque in national defense. Such historical perspective provides a useful background when considering their application to cyberspace. Part III applies legal and historical principles to a modern letter of marque regime. In particular, the application of letters of marque within the context of existing technologies and proposed authorization and oversight safeguards are examined. The various laws implicated in a modern cyber letter of marque regime are reviewed in Part IV. Finally, Part V addresses the authorizations and oversight necessary to effectively manage a successful, and lawful, cyber letter of marque regime. While not meant to be an exhaustive analysis of all possible facets related to the implementation of a cyber letter of marque regime, this article shows that despite some initial political and legal issues, using a cyber letter of marque can effectively mitigate the threats posed by cyber attacks.\n## II. History of Letter of Marque and Privateering The concept of allowing private individuals to wage war on a foreign sovereign is not new, nor is it unique to United AUGUST 2013 • THE ARMY LAWYER • DA PAM 27-50-483 States history. The letter of marque²⁷ and privateering concepts have been a part of both international law and the accepted norms of warfare for centuries,²⁸ despite the Declaration of Paris—which purportedly banned privateering.²⁹ Hugo Grotius, considered by many to be the father of the modern Law of Armed Conflict, noted that letters of marque and reprisal are endorsed by the entirety of the law of nations.³⁰ Historians credit the expansion and development of the Western world from 1600 to 1815 to privateers.³¹ The letter of marque originally served as a “self-help” authorization, allowing a private individual to seek reprisal against a foreigner who caused him harm.³² Over time, this developed into a government’s authorization to act on its behalf and seize property belonging to an enemy government, usually in the form of ships and cargo.³³ In its most fundamental form, a letter or marque authorized private merchant ships to carry arms in self-defense.³⁴ Upon its founding, due to its small navy,³⁵ not only did the United States employ letters of marque, but it also was “the world’s biggest proponent of privateering.”³⁶ The Continental Congress issued many letters of marque,³⁷ as did individual states.³⁸ In fact, John Adams reportedly called an early letter of marque scheme, the Massachusetts Armed Vessels Act, “one of the most important documents of the Revolution.”³⁹ Thomas Jefferson was also an ardent proponent of privateering: “every possible encouragement should be given to privateering in time of war.... Our national ships are too few... to... retaliate the [sic] acts of the enemy. But by licensing private armed vessels, the whole naval force of the nation is truly brought to bear on the foe.”⁴⁰ Jefferson also realized that letters of marque served more than an offensive purpose, detailing how they are also a means of self-defense: The ship Jane is an English merchant vessel... employed in the commerce between Jamaica and these States. She brought here a cargo of produce... and was to take away... flour. Knowing of the war when she left Jamaica, and that our coast was lined with small French privateers, she armed for her defense [sic], and took one of those commissions usually called letters of marque. She arrived here safely... Can it be necessary to say that a merchant vessel is not a privateer? That though she has arms to defend herself in time of war, in the course of her regular commerce, this no more makes her a privateer, than a husbandman following his plough in time of war, with a knife or pistol in his pocket, is thereby made a soldier. The occupation of a privateer is attack and plunder, that of a merchant AUGUST 2013 • THE ARMY LAWYER • DA PAM 27-50-483 vessel is commerce and self-preservation.⁴¹ Support for letters of marque by the founding fathers was not merely philosophical consent. Thomas Paine and George Washington both owned stock in privateering ventures.⁴² Additionally, Benjamin Franklin practically ran his own privateering operation while he was assigned to France.⁴³ While most privateering ventures were for money, Franklin used the captured British ships, goods and men to trade for American prisoners of war.⁴⁴ Privateering in general weakened an enemy’s economy and its ability to wage war.⁴⁵ The American privateers devastated British commerce, funding the first two years of the war substantially through British captures.⁴⁶ By early 1777, the British had lost 250 ships, resulting in the collapse of several major London-based West India merchant companies.⁴⁷ Within a year, American privateers captured 559 British ships.⁴⁸ Of the approximately 796 British ships captured during the Revolutionary War, American privateers and armed merchant ships accounted for roughly 600.⁴⁹ British merchants, feeling the crippling effect of American privateers,⁵⁰ ensured that “every pressure was brought to bear on Parliament for [the Revolutionary War’s] discontinuance.”⁵¹ Even ships carrying linen from England to Ireland feared the American privateers, to the point of demanding warship escorts.⁵² At the outset of the War of 1812, the British Navy consisted of 1,060 warships. In contrast, the United States Navy had only sixteen, including several that were unfit for sea.⁵³ As a consequence, the United States Navy was not considered to be a serious threat to British naval superiority.⁵⁴ In response, Congress passed a statute authorizing the use of privateers, but tightly controlled them.⁵⁵ The President could revoke, “at pleasure,” any letters of marque he issued after June 1812. The applicant had to list specific details about the ship, crew, and owners, and “Ample security” submitted to ensure compliance with both international and United States law. Further, and perhaps most relevant to modern application, the ship commanders were required to keep a detailed log of everything “that occurs, daily, and transmit them to the government,” and regular United States Navy commanders had to examine these logbooks when “meeting the privateer at sea.”⁵⁶ Failure to abide by these rules would mean forfeiture of the bond and “of all interest in any captures which they may make.”⁵⁷ With this new authorization in hand, American privateers wreaked havoc on British shipping and secured victory in America’s second war for independence.⁵⁸ In the process, privateers tallied $39 million in prizes, or roughly $672.5 million in 2012 dollars.⁵⁹ Following the War of 1812, letters of marque did not disappear from the American landscape. President Andrew Jackson, in 1834, discussed the use of letters of marque against France.⁶⁰ Texas, upon declaring independence from Mexico, realized its coast was vulnerable due to a nascent navy. In response, the fledgling Texas legislature began to issue letters of marque with the intent to “protect the coast, harass Mexican shipping, and bring prizes that could be ⁴¹ Richard, supra note 19, at 437 (citing Letter from Thomas Jefferson, to Gouverneur Morris (Aug. 16, 1793)), in 3 MEMOIR, CORRESPONDENCE AND MISCELLANIES FROM THE PAPERS OF THOMAS JEFFERSON 275 (1829).\n⁴² Tabarrok, supra note 21, at 567.\n⁴³ Id.; see generally WILLIAM BELL CLARK, BEN FRANKLIN’S PRIVATEERS (1956).\n⁴⁴ Tabarrok, supra note 21, at 567.\n⁴⁵ CARL E.

In all, Texas issued six letters of marque.⁶¹ Similarly, President Polk recognized the lawful ability of Mexico to issue letters of marque during the Mexican American War.⁶² In 1856, Britain, France and other titular world powers met in Paris to discuss concerns arising from wartime maritime law.⁶³ France and Great Britain sought to end privateering as they could not effectively control the use of privateers by their enemies, i.e., the United States and Russia.⁶⁴ Great Britain, in particular, recognized privateering as an effective tool of weaker navies that posed a threat to its naval supremacy and sought to contain it.⁶⁵ The result of this meeting was the Paris Declaration of 1856, a document attempting to ban privateering.⁶⁶ The Paris Declaration contained three major provisions:⁶⁷ the first provided that “[p]rivateering is, and remains, abolished;” the second prevented the seizing of enemy goods on neutral ships; and the third prevented capture of neutral goods on enemy ships.⁶⁸ Most importantly, the Declaration went to great pains to ensure that its provisions did not apply to any nation save signatories.⁶⁹ This provision is important for two reasons.\nFirst, it made clear that it was not intended to be a universal ban on privateering, as it only applied to signatory nations at war with other signatories.⁷⁰ Second, as stated in the document, it did not have the power to police the actions of non-signatories.⁷¹ The United States recognized that this agreement was merely a means for England to maintain maritime supremacy at the expense of nations with a smaller seafaring force, and accordingly, demanded conditions prior to capitulation.⁷² The United States agreed to acquiesce and sign the document only if protection of all non-contraband private property from capture at sea was included.⁷³ The United States reasoned that since all private property is protected on land, “why should it not be [protected] also on the sea?”⁷⁴ While the United States wanted to ensure it would be allowed to trade with both sides of a conflict, free from privateer entanglements, another more vital concern existed. According to Secretary of State William L. Marcy, “the United States could not forgo the right to send out privateers, which in the past had proved her most effective maritime weapon in time of war, and which, since she had no large navy, were essential to her fighting power.”⁷⁵ The United States realized that if privateering was banned, its nascent navy⁷⁶ would be no match for the greater naval might of countries such as Britain and France.⁷⁷ As the plenipotentiaries who signed the Declaration would not adequately address American concerns regarding private goods, and factoring in Marcy’s concern about the resulting unequal balance of naval power, the United States refused to sign the agreement.⁷⁸ The issue of privateering arose again in April 1861 when Confederate President Jefferson Davis, with Confederate Congressional approval,⁷⁹ issued letters of ⁶¹ TEXAS PRIVATEERS, https://www.tsl.state.tx.us/exhibits/navy/privateers.html (last modified Aug. 30, 2011).\n⁶² Although President Polk did take issue with the blank letters of marque issued by Mexico, arguing those were illegal under international law and those acting in accordance with such letters are considered to be pirates.

Perhaps fearing the involvement of the British or French navies in the conflict, the Union declared that it would follow the Declaration and not issue letters of marque and Secretary of State Seward instructed American ambassadors to determine whether the signatories would be amicable to incorporating the proposed changes advocated by Marcy, thus allowing the United States to formally sign the Declaration.⁸¹ As an indication of the Union’s fear of privateers, Secretary Seward authorized acquiescence to the Declaration even if the requested exceptions were not approved.⁸² Britain and France declined the advances and the United States remained a non-signatory.⁸³ Consequently, the Union passed a statutory authorization for President Lincoln to issue letters of marque⁸⁴ and declared that all attempts to disrupt, capture or destroy Union shipping would be treated as piracy and dealt with as such.⁸⁵ Regardless, the British entered the Civil War as privateers, sailing under letters of marque issued by the Confederacy. In fact, in a case brought by the United States against Britain for damages caused by a privateer, an international tribunal found no issue with a non-signatory (the Confederacy) issuing letters of marque to a signatory (Britain) “to construct, furnish, and crew ships to be used in commerce raids against a non-signatory, the United States.”⁸⁶ When the United States entered into conflict with the Spanish during the Spanish American War, neither the United States nor Spain was a signatory to the Declaration of Paris.⁸⁷ Not only did Spain specifically reserve the right to issue letters of marque,⁸⁸ the Spanish government recognized America’s right and ability to issue the same.⁸⁹ The Spanish never carried out the threat, and President McKinley, for the first time, articulated a U.S. intention to comply with the Paris Declaration, though still not be a signatory.⁹⁰ Despite the reluctance, both Spain and the United States found ways to unofficially authorize privateers without formally issuing letters of marque.⁹¹ Both nations organized “auxiliary cruisers of the Navy.”⁹² The United States Navy chartered private merchant ships, heavily armed them, and subsequently entered into naval service.⁹³ The Navy used the ships and manned them with the owner’s regular, ostensibly civilian crew, placing the ships “under the entire control of the senior naval officer on board.”⁹⁴ One such ship, the City of Paris,⁹⁵ actually took prizes, with the United States Prize Court holding that she was not a “vessel of the Navy nor a privateer...”⁹⁶ and finally ruling that she was an “armed vessel in the service of the United States” and the civilian crew was “entitled as of right to share in the prize money.”⁹⁷ While the nature of privateering changed with the Spanish-American War, privateering did not disappear. At the 1907 Hague Peace Conference, the United States again voiced its opposition to the privateering prohibition.⁹⁸ Specifically, the United States voiced the same concerns as ⁸⁰ ADAMS, supra note 72, at 141; JAMES D.

Applying Letters of Marque to Cyber Warfare Letters of marque were the original “self-help” governmental authorization.¹⁰⁴ While used to great effect in the past, they can now be resurrected and used to achieve similar results, especially in a cyber context. This section addresses the use of a cyber letter of marque in three areas: seizing assets; disrupting, disabling, and dismantling adversarial networks; and conducting cyber bounty hunting and rewards programs.\n## A. Seizing Assets In a modern cyber letter of marque scheme, the U.S. government would authorize certain companies or individuals to track, freeze, and seize the illicit funds of designated criminal organizations. The net effect would be cutting off supplies to deliver the United States from its enemies.¹⁰⁵ For example, the United States has recently named several Russians as “transnational criminals” and promulgated an Executive Order that authorizes “seizure of their assets in the United States and prevents them from banking in dollars anywhere in the world.”¹⁰⁶ When rogue states, such as Iran, contravene the will of the international community, the most used method of ensuring compliance is via the United Nations Security Council or unilateral economic sanctions.¹⁰⁷ The United States first instituted sanctions against Iran in 1979, following the seizure of the American Embassy during the Iranian Revolution. These sanctions included freezing roughly $11 billion in Iranian assets.¹⁰⁸ Iran continues to launder and hide money in contravention of these resolutions, often with the help of international banks.¹⁰⁹ In just one instance, the illicit transactions totaled $250 billion.¹¹⁰ Iran has also turned to China, specifically its banking system, for help in escaping economic sanctions.¹¹¹ Illicit money laundering in contravention of United Nations resolutions is not limited to Iran, but has also included North Korea, Cuba, Sudan, and Mexican criminal cartels.¹¹² ⁹⁹ See supra Part II.\n¹⁰⁰ CHOATE, supra note 98, at 40.\n¹⁰¹ Id.\n¹⁰² Some have alleged that blimps operated on the west coast of the United States during World War II pursuant to letters of marque. “The Los Angeles based Resolute was the only airship... operated for the Navy under privateer status....” JAMES SHOCK &amp; DAVID SMITH, THE GOODYEAR AIRSHIPS 43 (2002).

A cyber letter of marque would allow a privateer to seek these illicit funds wherever they may be hidden and either seize them or digitally sequester them for further law enforcement action. Such a cyber letter of marque brings to bear a formidable resource that will increase the likelihood for seizure of illicit funds and the shutdown of avenues for illicit funding.\nThe idea of using a letter of marque to effect an economic result is not novel. John Adams, in singing the virtues of privateering, said “[I]t is by cutting off supplies, not by attacks, sieges, or assaults, that I expect deliverance from enemies.”[119] While letters of marque during the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812 had distinct military objectives, they were\"also a means of commercial warfare conducted for profit.\"[120] Privateers\"were engaged not in patriotic, but business ventures.\"[121] Some privateers amassed great fortunes through their letter of marque commissions,[122] with even the common seaman receiving up to one thousand dollars above his regular wage from just one voyage.[123] The proceeds from captured enemy goods, once sold via the Unites States Prize Courts, were split between the privateer and the sovereign, thus providing a much needed injection of funds to the government and the privateer, while at the same time depriving the enemy of resources.[124] Motivated by the possibility of retaining a healthy percentage of the roughly $1.6 trillion presently illicitly laundered worldwide, the number of prospective cyber privateers would be legion. Consequently, the United States government would be in a position to demand an exorbitantly high bond, thus guaranteeing that only the most technically proficient and responsible cyber privateers would seek the commission. As for the cyber profiteer, the prospect of sharing a large percentage of the trillions of dollars, not to mention the potential for criminal or tort liability,[125] would ensure strict compliance with the terms of the letter of marque. As the privateer in the 1700s and 1800s provided both a much needed governmental funding stream[126] and served a valid national security function, so too would a modern cyber privateer by removing illicit funds from the hands of organized crime and sanction violators. The end result would be a potential death blow to crime organizations and rogue regimes.\nCurrently, the law restricts anyone from attempting to seize assets, whether they belong to the most deplorable rogue regime or the most vicious drug cartel. A cyber letter of marque would vest responsible and vetted entities with authority to digitally seize illicit funds while providing legal protections from criminal and/or civil liability. Current laws restricting attempted seizures would remain in place for those acting without a valid letter of marque or those AUGUST 2013 • THE ARMY LAWYER • DA PAM 27-50-483 operating outside the scope of their letter of marque commissions.\n## B. Disrupting, Disabling, and Dismantling Adversarial Networks In December 2012, a cybercriminal known as “vorVzakone”¹²⁷ announced Project Blitzkrieg, wherein he¹²⁸ planned to attack 30 Unites States banks in an attempt to steal money from accounts belonging to the “rich.”¹²⁹ McAfee Labs, a leading computer security company,¹³⁰ determined that this “is a credible threat to the financial industry and appears to be moving forward as planned.”¹³¹ The projected losses from the announced attack could reach “hundreds of millions of dollars.”¹³² The targets of the planned attack included Bank of America, Capitol One, Suntrust, Ameritrade, eTrade, and Fidelity and Schwab.¹³³ From April to December 2012, vorVzakone claimed at least 500 cyber victims.¹³⁴ At roughly the same time that the U.S. banking industry began to deal with vorVzakone, bank officials were contending with cyber attacks emanating from Iran.¹³⁵ The attack’s complexities are comparable to that of “a pack of fire-breathing Godzillas.”¹³⁶ In fact, the internet traffic used in the attacks has been “multiple times” the number that Russia allegedly directed or encouraged at Estonia in a month-long online assault in 2007 that nearly crippled the ¹²⁷ Literally translated means “thief in law.” See KREBS ON SECURITY, New Findings Lend Credence to Project Blitzkrieg, http://krebsonsecurity.com/tag/vorvzakone-gozi-prinimalku/ (last visited Dec. 12, 2012).\n¹²⁸ While the exact identity of vorKzakone is unknown, he is believed to be a male, as shown by alleged photographs of vorKzakone online.

As discussed previously,¹⁵⁴ American privateers disrupted English commerce to such an extent that several London-based firms went bankrupt.¹⁵⁵ British merchants, their livelihoods so disrupted and, in fact, disabled, put pressure on their own government to end the war and allow the Americans to have their independence.¹⁵⁶ The financial toll on the enemy during the War of 1812 by American privateers was staggering, which in turn had the operative effect of weakening both British naval superiority and morale in England. If privateering proved to be such an effective defensive weapon in a naval context, it can certainly be used in a cyber context where disrupting an enemy’s attack can be done through a keyboard by a handful of individuals instead of through fourteen-gun warships manned by over a hundred crewmen.¹⁵⁷ ## C. Cyber Bounty Hunting The realm of cyber letters of marque is not limited to offensive or defensive actions in the classic sense. A cyber letter of marque could also be utilized as a method of bounty hunting, providing information to law enforcement agencies necessary to apprehend a cyber attacker.\nBounty hunting, like a letter of marque, is an activity intertwined with the history of the United States. The United States Supreme Court endorsed bounty hunting as a legal activity in the 1872 case *Taylor v. Taintor*.¹⁵⁸ The federal government endorsed, and continues to endorse, bounty hunting for capture (as opposed to kill) as exemplified in the most wanted lists.¹⁵⁹ Perhaps most famously, the United ¹⁴⁶ Bardin, *supra* note 13.\n¹⁴⁷ *Id.*; Jody Westby, *Caution: Active Response to Cyber Attacks Has High Risk*, FORBES.COM, Nov. 29, 2012, http://www.forbes.com/sites/jodywestby/2012/11/29/caution-active-response-to-cyber-attacks-has-high-risk/.\n¹⁴⁸ *N.

The language usually cited as Supreme Court authorization for bounty hunting states: When bail is given, the principal is regarded as delivered to the custody of his sureties. Their dominion is a continuance of the original imprisonment. Whenever they choose to do so, they may seize him and deliver him up in their discharge; and if that cannot be done at once, they may imprison him until it can be done. They may exercise their rights in person or by agent. They may pursue him into another State; may arrest him on the Sabbath; and, if necessary, may break and enter his house for that purpose.

This, arguably, would be illegal under current United States law.¹⁷⁰ The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) serves as a barrier to a corporation or individual¹⁷¹ from coming to the aid of a cyber-attack victim. Congress could carefully draft cyber letter of marquee legislation authorizing such entities to track and digitally “capture” a cyber criminal or terrorist. The only difference between the reward/bounty programs currently operated by the United States Government and a cyber letter of marque is the antiquated CFAA prohibition.\nIndeed, other scholars have posited the use of bounty hunting letters of marque.¹⁷² For example, Robert P. DeWitte, writing in the Indiana Law Journal, discussed one of the potential downfalls between physical, as opposed to virtual, bounty hunting through the use of a letter of marque. In particular, he illuminated the legitimate concern that “state authorities could conceivably attempt to capture and/or kill privateers” in their territory while operating under a valid U.S. letter of marque.¹⁷³ However, this concern in a cyber letter of marque context is not applicable since the cyber privateer/bounty hunter would be safely ensconced in the territorial United States, outside the physical reach of an unfriendly foreign armed force.\nJust as letters of marque are constitutional,¹⁷⁴ so too are bounties, as over a hundred years of U.S. jurisprudence demonstrates.¹⁷⁵ The issuance of a cyber letter of marque ¹⁶⁹ See, e.g., NAT’L ASS’N FUGITIVE RECOVERY AGENTS (N.A.F.R.A.), http://fugitive-recovery.org/ (last visited Dec. 24, 2012); NAT’L ASS’N BAIL BOND INVESTIGATORS, http://nabbi.org/ (last visited Dec. 24, 2012).\n¹⁷⁰ The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1030 (2006), would most likely prevent a company or individual from taking these steps.

A cyber letter of marque would allow a cyber privateer access to those established and protected legal mechanisms.\n## IV. Legal Barriers Despite the many potential applications of a cyber letter of marque, some arguments raise concerns about the legality of its application. When discussing letters of marque, most commentators cite to the same alleged legal barriers to implementation: domestic law, usually the CFAA; the Law of Armed Conflict, specifically attribution and self-defense concerns; the Paris Declaration of 1856; and the Council of Europe Convention on Cyber-crime. This section examines each of these areas and analyzes why they are not legal barriers to the implementation of a cyber letter of marque regime.\n### A. The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act,¹⁷⁷ initially a criminal statute protecting government computers and those computers belonging to entities with compelling government interests,¹⁷⁸ forces companies under attack to “just stand and take a beating.”¹⁷⁹ Since its passage in 1984, it has expanded¹⁸⁰ to include civil liability by prohibiting anyone from “intentionally access[ing] a protected computer without authorization or exceed[ing] authorized access... [and recklessly causing damage¹⁸¹ involving a loss¹⁸² of] at least $5,000 in value.”¹⁸³ The definition of a “protected computer” has expanded to cover not only U.S. government computers, but also any computer “used in a manner that affects interstate or foreign commerce.”¹⁸⁴ Even those computers located outside the United States are protected.¹⁸⁵ Potentially, every single computer connected to the internet anywhere in the world would be a “protected computer” pursuant to the CFAA,¹⁸⁶ including, potentially, a blue-tooth-enabled garage door opener or coffeemaker in suburbia.¹⁸⁷ While the CFAA prohibits the mere access to a protected computer, causing damage seems to be the lynchpin to triggering civil and criminal penalties under the CFAA. Some courts have homed in on the damage requirement, refusing to find civil or criminal liability. For example, in *Moulton v. VC3*,¹⁸⁸ the court held that an unauthorized port scan and throughput test of a defendant’s servers is not a violation of the CFAA¹⁸⁹ since no “damage” was caused. Likewise, in *United States v. Czubinski*,¹⁹⁰ the court reversed the criminal conviction of an IRS agent who accessed a “protected computer” to satisfy his curiosity.¹⁹¹ While some of the judicial decisions seem to allow some degree of cyber intelligence collection under the current regulatory scheme,¹⁹² the courts clearly would not allow an entity to seize assets, whether they are being laundered at a major international bank or if information leading to their location is on a drug kingpin’s desktop ¹⁷⁶ 31 U.S.C. §§ 3729–3733 (2006).\n¹⁷⁷ 18 U.S.C. § 1030 (2006).\n¹⁷⁸ This included not only government computers and networks, but also those of large banks, the New York Stock Exchange, etc. Robert B.

Consequently, government authorization would first be a necessity.¹⁹³ Despite allowing for criminal and civil penalties, the CFAA is not an effective means of preventing cyber attacks.¹⁹⁴ Some have argued that active-defense authorizations, such as a letter of marque, are not necessary as the cyber victim can turn over evidence of a cyber attack to the FBI for prosecution.¹⁹⁵ While this might work in theory, in actual practice it leaves the cyber victim virtually remediless for a host of reasons. For one, law enforcement personnel are questionably competent when it comes to cyber attacks and cyber crime.¹⁹⁶ Further, due to the global nature of cyber attacks, an American court might have a difficult time bringing a cyber attacker within its jurisdiction.¹⁹⁷ Even if a cyber attack victim captures all the information necessary to conduct a thorough law enforcement investigation, the FBI has bungled such gift-wrapped cyber cases in the past.¹⁹⁸ Just as cyber criminals are capable of seizing money from an individual’s bank accounts,¹⁹⁹ cyber companies with the technical expertise can track down and seize illicit funds, given the proper governmental authorization. A cyber letter of marque would provide such authorization.\n## B. Attribution and Self-Defense Attribution is the legal requirement to positively identify the attacker prior to responding with force in self-defense.²⁰⁰ How does a prospective cyber privateer ensure it is striking the proper target²⁰¹ and how does a cyber-privateer cover their tracks so as to not entice further attacks? Admittedly, discovering the source of a cyber attack is “the most important aspect of active defense.”²⁰² It necessarily must be a requirement when issuing a cyber letter of marque to ensure that the privateer is targeting the proper bad actor. Critics have complained that it is too difficult to identify the attacker with sufficient accuracy to ensure a counter-attack is accurately aimed.²⁰³ While tracing an attack may not provide actionable results, and some technologies “limit the ability to make perfect surgical strikes with active defense,”²⁰⁴ the problem may not be as big as it appears. Some speculate that it is more difficult for the bad actor to identify the cyber privateer than it is for the cyber privateer to identify the bad actor.²⁰⁵ The attribution concerns may, however, be a bit overblown.²⁰⁶ Even the Russian cyber attacks launched or encouraged against Estonia could be traced back to the “Russian intelligence apparatus.”²⁰⁷ In fact, “attribution to at least some level will almost always be possible.”²⁰⁸ While the exact technologies available to ensure accurate attribution, which can be done in seconds, are not the focus of this paper, such technology is not new and “is currently the subject of a significant amount of research aimed at improving accuracy and efficiency.”²⁰⁹ While it may not be feasible, or even possible, to accurately attribute 100 million cyber attacks,²¹⁰ “it is clear that the current state of the ¹⁹³ See, e.g., NRC REPORT, supra note 18 (discussing the exemption for lawfully authorized law enforcement and intelligence agencies activities to the CFAA and how government agencies may commandeer private computes or pay for their usage).\n¹⁹⁴ See supra Part I (discussing of the frequency of cyber attacks).

It has had little to no affect on cyber attacks.\n¹⁹⁵ See, e.g., Westby, supra note 147.\n¹⁹⁶ Ms. Westby, while arguing a cyber victim should turn over information to law enforcement instead of proactively defending themselves, admits that “there are too few of them with skills adequate to match the sophisticated nature of today’s cyber criminals.” Id.

Paris Declaration of 1856 Most critics of the letter of marque, regardless of its application, usually point to the Paris Declaration of 1856, noting that the United States is prohibited from employing privateers due to the agreement.²¹² This argument, however, is without merit.\nFirst, the Declaration does not apply to the United States per the plain language of the treaty. “The present Declaration is not and shall not be binding, except between those Powers who have acceded, or shall accede, to it.”²¹³ The United States did not accede to it in 1856 and has not, in the ensuing 157 years, acceded to it. Under the rules of treaty interpretation,²¹⁴ a treaty is binding only upon parties to it,²¹⁵ and it “does not create either obligations or rights for a third State without its consent.”²¹⁶ Further, in order to impose an obligation on a third State, it must “expressly accept that obligation in writing.”²¹⁷ To date, the United States has not consented to the obligations of the Declaration in writing, as required by the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.\nAdditionally, the Declaration clearly pertains, and limits itself, to maritime law.²¹⁸ Since a cyber letter of marque regime is not grounded in maritime law and letters of marque are specifically authorized in the United States Constitution, it is permissible under international law, Paris Declaration notwithstanding, to issue cyber letters of marque.\nOthers argue²¹⁹ that the Declaration has become customary international law.²²⁰ While this might be true at first blush, it ignores the legal and historical fact. A nation, not otherwise bound by a treaty, does not become bound by operation of the rule of customary international law if it has been a persistent objector. In order to be considered a persistent objector, and therefore not bound by a treaty, the State “must have objected to the emergence of a new norm during its formation and continue to object afterwards.”²²¹ Even if it has been state practice to follow the precepts in a treaty, non-signatory states can alter their actions in order to confront new threats.²²² Regarding the Declaration of Paris, the United States objected during the formation of the proposed privateering ban²²³ and objected to the Declaration by passing legislation authorizing privateers during the Civil War;²²⁴ the Spanish government recognized America’s right to issue letters of marque during the Spanish-American War,²²⁵ and voiced opposition at the 1907 Hague Peace Conference.²²⁶ Clearly, the United States has been a persistent objector to the Declaration and thus not bound by it. Simply stated, American privateering declined not because of acquiescence to international treaties which it did not, and had no intent to, sign. Rather, privateering declined because America, after 1898, no longer had a nascent navy, had become a major AUGUST 2013 • THE ARMY LAWYER • DA PAM 27-50-483 naval power,²²⁷ and the “cost-saving advantages of privateering [had] declined.”²²⁸ Assuming, *arguendo*, that the Paris Declaration is customary international law that the United States must follow, the issuance of cyber letters of marque is still not banned. The Declaration never defines privateers.²²⁹ As history demonstrates, a contracted civilian ship can be armed, staffed with civilians, fight, and take prizes—all without violating the Declaration.²³⁰ ## D. The Council of Europe Convention on Cyber-Crime²³¹ On 23 November 2001, the United States signed on to the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime.²³² The Cybercrime Convention came into effect in the United States on 1 January 2007.²³³ The Cybercrime Convention’s main objective “is to pursue a common criminal policy aimed at the protection of society against cyber-crime, especially by adopting appropriate legislation and fostering international co-operation.”²³⁴ It purports to allow countries to work together through substantive, procedural, and jurisdictional laws against a cyber criminal committing crimes in one country while physically located in another.²³⁵ Prior to the Cybercrime Convention (and some would argue even today),²³⁶ the cyber police forces in the United States or internationally did not have the tools or authority necessary to combat cyber-attacks. Additionally, it did not address the cultural issues that may arise from crimes committed in cyberspace.²³⁷ To make matters worse, some countries did not have adequate laws against cyber-crime.²³⁸ An attempt to correct these law enforcement deficiencies was the impetus for the creation of the Cybercrime Convention. It remains the only international treaty attempting to deal with the issue of transcontinental cyber attacks.²³⁹ It fails, however, to effectively protect anyone from cyber attacks. It is largely a symbolic document, serving mainly to reassure the public that governments are doing *something* to address the threat.²⁴⁰ Those reassurances are hollow, as only roughly half of the ratifying states have passed domestic legislation required to enforce the document.²⁴¹ Remarkably, the exceptions contained in the Cybercrime Convention negate its impact. First, no requirement exists that any cyber attacker actually be prosecuted; instead, the State must merely “report the final outcome to the requesting Party [i.e., the cyber victim’s nation] in due course.”²⁴² In addition, nearly every enforcement provision of the Cybercrime Convention contains a legislative flaw, allowing a nation state to refuse to cooperate.²⁴³ A nation may refuse a request for assistance during or after a cyber attack emanating from its country for a host of reasons. These reasons include, but are not limited to²⁴⁴: if a request for assistance would violate domestic laws,²⁴⁵ if a request for assistance and information gained AUGUST 2013 • THE ARMY LAWYER • DA PAM 27-50-483 therefrom could be used in any investigation or court proceedings other than those listed in the request,²⁴⁶ or if an attacked nation believes there are political issues at play.²⁴⁷ Perhaps as a sign of the naïve belief that the feckless Cybercrime Convention will actually curb cyber attacks, the Council of Europe’s Committee of Experts on Terrorism opined in February 2010 that no further conventions are needed to address cyber terrorism because “large scale attacks on computer systems appeared to be already covered by the Cybercrime Convention.”²⁴⁸ Yet two days later, on 18 February 2010, The Washington Post broke the story that more than 75,000 computers and roughly 2,500 companies in the United States, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Turkey, and Mexico were victims of “one of the largest and most sophisticated attacks by cyber criminals discovered to date.”²⁴⁹ The attack began in 2008 and was not discovered until January 2010.²⁵⁰ In the United States, an unnamed Department of Justice official purportedly alleged that the “impact of the convention [is] ‘very positive,’” which, again, seems to ignore the reality of cyber attack’s scope.²⁵¹ To the contrary, the Cybercrime Convention seems to merely limit the ability of a law-abiding entity to take proactive steps necessary to cease a cyber threat.²⁵² Because the Cybercrime Convention does not diminish cyber attacks, lacks any enforcement or prosecution mechanism and expressly states that signatory states pass domestic criminal laws covering “illegal access,”²⁵³ “illegal interception,”²⁵⁴ criminal “misuse of devices,”²⁵⁵ [emphasis added], the United States is not prevented from issuing letters of marque. If Congress exercised its constitutionally authorized power to issue letters of marque, limited to cyber operations, no violation of any provision of the Convention would occur because no domestic criminal acts occur.\nEven the U.S. Attorney General stated, in 2006, that the Cybercrime Convention “is in full accord with all U.S. Constitutional protections.”²⁵⁶ The activity undertaken pursuant to a constitutionally authorized and congressionally endorsed cyber letter of marque would not, under United States law, be illegal and thus not a violation of any provision contained in the Cybercrime Convention. In short, a cyber letter of marque issued by Congress would not violate the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime.\n## V. Authorizations and Oversight While a cyber letter of marque is legal, both under domestic and international law, any cyber letter of marque regime must provide for a method of authorizing and subsequently supervising a cyber privateer. This section discusses some potential methods of authorization and oversight necessary for an effective cyber letter of marque regime.\n## A. Issuance of Bonds and Authorizations Prior to the issuance of a letter of marque, all prospective cyber privateers should be required to register with a central governmental database. This database would provide the supervising agency²⁵⁷ with a means of not only policing cyber privateers and holding them accountable, but also a means for parties allegedly aggrieved by United States authorized cyber privateers to seek redress. Such a database and registration would also allow the supervisory agency an opportunity to vet the putative cyber privateer. “If a company does not have the skills to defend its systems, it likely does not have the skills to attack back—or make AUGUST 2013 • THE ARMY LAWYER • DA PAM 27-50-483 Do we really think that establishing a convention on cyber crime is going to stop our adversaries? They do not recognize our virtual boards or virtual sovereignty as it is. Why would they recognize a convention on cyber crime? All this does is force offensive cyber forces to establish an unwieldy ‘rules of engagement’ that ties the hands of those who can execute offensive cyber actions.\nBardin, *supra* note 13.\n\ndecisions about whether to engage in such actions.”²⁵⁸ If the applicant does not possess the requisite skills, then its request for a cyber letter of marque is denied.²⁵⁹ Further, all applicants must be able to post a bond commensurate with potential liability exposure. “Letters of marque should only be issued to security firms able to post a significant bond and meet specific qualification and training requirements.”²⁶⁰ The bond requirement is the most effective method for screening out “start-ups” and “fly-by-night” security companies from seeking a letter of marque.²⁶¹ The Act Concerning Letters-of-Marque, Prizes &amp; Prize Goods specifically states that before the issuance of any commission of letters of marque, a bond in the amount of five thousand dollars, or ten thousand dollars if the ship had more than one hundred and fifty men, would have to be paid by two “responsible sureties, not interested in such vessel.”²⁶² The payment of such a steep bond ensures that privateers strictly adhere to congressional rules.²⁶³ In a cyber context, since the stakes are so high, a prospective cyber privateer should be required to supply a large monetary bond.²⁶⁴ A large monetary bond would not only ensure that responsible entities apply for and receive cyber letters of marque, but also that those with the requisite discretion and technical expertise are the only ones acting with congressional authority as a cyber privateer. The prime importance of competent exercise of the powers enumerated in the letter of marque is underscored when the vast amount of money and intellectual property lost on a frequent and recurring basis, coupled with the exacting nature of establishing positive identification, especially attribution, is contemplated. A large monetary bond would, in effect, keep the cyber cutthroats out of this business.\nSingapore established CaseTrust, a similar system, in order to protect consumers engaged in e-commerce. CaseTrust receives complaints against e-vendors and legitimizes member companies. Prior to joining, a prospective e-vendor must give a banker’s guarantee, or a bond, to establish that it is indeed a legitimate and reputable company. The CaseTrust system provides for compulsory adjudication including the power to not only fine a vendor, but also to revoke its certification. As a result, the consumer is protected by providing a source of bonded companies and a policing mechanism. Additionally, the commercial entities are shrouded with governmental legitimacy. To date, enforcement has been effective and participation is growing.²⁶⁵ In a historical context, the putative privateer kept detailed daily logs, which were available for inspection by any U.S. naval commander he might encounter.²⁶⁶ Similar requirements would be made of cyber privateers. As all internet activity can be, or actually is, easily monitored,²⁶⁷ this requirement does not place too onerous a burden on the purported cyber privateer. While most private companies are loathe to share details of their cyber activity for fear of losing intellectual property, a competitive edge, or disclose their cyber defenses or weaknesses,²⁶⁸ a company serious about executing a defensive or even offensive cyber letter of marque should be willing to accept the more stringent scrutiny, such as reviewing cyber logbooks.\nA cyber letter of marque would designate the bearers to be licensed combatants for the sovereign, authorizing them to “bear arms” in the cyber sense of the word, and either defend against specific attacks and launch counter attacks (back-backs) or engage in offensive cyber operations directed at sovereign selected targets or networks.²⁶⁹ A private company could be granted authorization to conduct a hack-back, temporarily incapacitating a cyber bad actor, and then notify the appropriate law enforcement or national security entity for final apprehension or network termination.²⁷⁰ AUGUST 2013 • THE ARMY LAWYER • DA PAM 27-50-483 In recognition that cyber privateers would, to a certain extent, be bearing arms, a workable set of rules of engagement would necessarily be a major part of the actual commission. Professor Susan Brenner has expressed concerns that cyber privateers could be motivated to vigilantism and exceed the bounds of their charter, exhibiting an inability to determine who is a just target.²⁷¹ These concerns can be easily alleviated by carefully drafted rules of engagement and scope of authorization in the letter of marque commission itself. If cyber privateers exceed the scope of the commission, they lose their substantial bond, face debarment from future government contracts, and open themselves up to potential criminal prosecutions since their actions were outside the scope of the immunity granted by the letter of marque. These adverse ramifications should keep a vetted and approved cyber privateer in line.\n## B. Legal and Judicial Oversight The legal framework for a workable letter of marque regime already exists under current federal law.²⁷² “Privateering worked only because it was backed by a substantial system of law, not only the common law of property, but also the statutory creations such as admiralty courts and bond requirements.”²⁷³ The federal judiciary is vested with original jurisdiction to determine prizes,²⁷⁴ burdens of proof established,²⁷⁵ the due process rights of both the captor and the captive duly considered,²⁷⁶ and the securitylaw.us/2012/11/30/steven-chabinsky-crowdstrike-ex-fbi-cyber-division-talks-pprivate-sector-cyberdeterrence-at-abas-natsec-law-conference/.\n²⁷¹ Brenner, supra note 212.\n²⁷² See, e.g., Commissioning Private Vessels for Seizure of Piratical Vessels, 33 U.S.C. § 386 (2006).\nThe President is authorized to instruct the commanders of the public armed vessels of the United States, and to authorize the commanders of any other armed vessels sailing under the authority of any letters of marquee and reprisal granted by Congress, or the commanders of any other suitable vessels, to subdue, seize, take, and, if on the high seas, to send into any port of the United States, any vessel or boat built, purchased, fitted out, or held as mentions in 33 U.S.C. § 385.\nId.\n²⁷³ Tabarrok, supra note 21, at 572.\n²⁷⁴ Jurisdiction, 10 U.S.C. § 7652 (2006).\n²⁷⁵ See The Resolution, 2 U.S. 19 (U.S. 1781) (holding that the burden of proving a prize was captured lawfully lies with the captors).\n²⁷⁶ The legality of a capture is not determined until a court of competent jurisdiction has issued an order making such a determination. Id. Whether property seized may be confiscated as a prize is a judicial question and each case is to be decided on its own facts. Property Captured by the Potomac Flotilla, 10 Op. Att’y Gen. 467 (1863).\ninterests of the United States represented by a duly appointed authority in the “United States attorney for the district in which the prize cause is adjudicated.”²⁷⁷ In fact, Chapter 655 of 10 U.S.C. contains the entire statutory framework to judicially administer a letter of marque regime.\nHistorical precedence demonstrates that judicial oversight is an effective means to monitor and police privateers. For example, the court invalidated the first two prizes claimed during the War of 1812 because of improperly issued letters of marque.²⁷⁸ Even the venerable USS Constitution was also involved in an illegitimate capture, a situation embarrassingly rectified by the courts.²⁷⁹ Indeed, a rich legal history of privateering cases exists before the United States Supreme Court.²⁸⁰ Some are concerned that the government would not be able to control the behavior of modern privateers, especially in a cyber context.²⁸¹ In reality, these concerns are easily addressed with stiff consequences.²⁸² Penalties can include forfeiture of the bond and any pay due as a result of a successful capture or mission, seizure of assets,²⁸³ debarment from all future government contracts,²⁸⁴ exclusion from future letter of marque commissions, criminal prosecution, and potential tort liability.²⁸⁵ At least two presidents proposed criminal prosecution for misuse of a letter of marque. President Jefferson, a major proponent of privateering during the Revolutionary War,²⁸⁶ declared that individuals operating off the coast without valid commissions be captured and tried as pirates.²⁸⁷ ²⁷⁷ Duties of United States Attorney, 10 U.S.C.A. § 7656 (2012).\n²⁷⁸ Tabarrok, supra note 21, at 568.\n²⁷⁹ The United States paid the owners of the captured ship $11,000 in damages. PETRIE, supra note 122, at 160.\n²⁸⁰ See, e.g., In re The Amiable Isabella, Munos, 19 U.S. 1 (1821); The Adeline, 9 Cranch 244 (1815); The Amy Warwick, 67 U.S. 635 (1862).\n²⁸¹ Brenner, supra note 212.\n²⁸² Richard, supra note 19, at 455.\n²⁸³ In a cyber context, this could include all computers and network capabilities.\n²⁸⁴ 48 C.F.R. §§ 9.406–406-05, (2012).\n²⁸⁵ See The Santissima Trinidad, 20 U.S. 283 (1822) (holding that illegal privateers, whether public or private, “are tortuous—and the original owner is entitled to restitution when brought within our jurisdiction”). Tort liability has real teeth, as government is generally immune from civil suit, whereas a letter of marque holder would not be. See David A. Sklansky, The Private Police, 46 UCLA L. REV. 1165, 1186 (1999); Richard, supra note 19, at 455.\n²⁸⁶ See supra Part II.\n²⁸⁷ UPTON, supra note 57, at 180.\nAUGUST 2013 • THE ARMY LAWYER • DA PAM 27-50-483 President Lincoln made a similar proclamation regarding privateers hired by the Confederate States, as he did not believe the “rebellious” states had legal authority to issue letters of marque.²⁸⁸ According to some scholars, one of the major drawbacks of the traditional letter of marque system was the lack of organization or unified command, control and communication.²⁸⁹ To address this concern, all cyber letter of marque holders would report their activities and progress to a central authority on a regular and recurring basis.²⁹⁰ This central authority would have the ability to terminate the cyber privateer’s commission and/or refer the matter to the Department of Justice for criminal prosecution, should the commissioner act outside the bounds of authority. As this central authority would have an over-arching view of which cyber privateers were acting in which arenas, they could deconflict any possible issues of interrupting law enforcement, intelligence, or national security operations in cyber space. Additionally, purely governmental agencies, such as the National Security Agency, would then be in a better position to work in concert with the cyber privateers to execute specific targeted operations.²⁹¹ ## VI. Conclusion “More destructive cyber weapons are being created every day... [eventually]... those who mean to harm the United States will gain the ability to launch a damaging attack. The United States must develop stronger defenses before this occurs.”²⁹² Despite this threat, the U.S. government seems to be content with merely allowing network owners to “[sit] there... trying to swat away these intrusions.”²⁹³ Industry experts have specifically asked that Congress “provide opportunities and responsibilities to the private sector to hack back.”²⁹⁴ Perhaps in tacit acknowledgement that the private sector is better prepared to handle cyber issues, the United States Air Force solicits private industry for capabilities designed to “destroy, deny, degrade, disrupt, deceive, corrupt, or usurp the adversaries [sic] ability to use the cyberspace domain for his advantage.”²⁹⁵ Additionally, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DAPRA), through its “Plan X,” sought “innovative research proposals” in an effort to “dominate the cyber battle space.”²⁹⁶ Congress has not only denied these requests, while at the same time ignoring the Air Force and DARPA’s proposed use of private industry, but at the same time tied their hands with respect to possible civil and criminal liability.²⁹⁷ Members of Congress have instead suggested legislative mandates requiring “owners and operators of vital infrastructure [to] better protect networks,” or even tax credits as a means of encouraging corporations to establish stricter cyber security safeguards.²⁹⁸ Congress has failed to provide industry with the tools they are desperately asking for: a means in which to protect themselves in a meaningful way.\nPolitical policy makers must understand that “[i]n cyberspace, the offense has the upper hand” and the nation cannot remain secure while hiding behind a mythical all protective firewall.²⁹⁹ Accordingly, Congress should exercise its constitutional authority and authorize the issuance of cyber letters of marque and allow American entities to actively defend themselves in cyber space.\nAs delineated above, the letter of marque has a rich tradition, not only in international and maritime law, but also in American history. Were it not for this power, the United States might not ever have gained her freedom, much less secured it in the War of 1812.³⁰⁰ The United States justly refused to acquiesce to a ban on privateering and that ban is not binding to this day.³⁰¹ As advanced in this article, a cyber letter of marque can, with adequate safeguards in place,³⁰² protect our current infrastructure, obtain information on emerging threats, and then eliminate such threats. Taking into account the current state of the law and the restrictions that prevent an adequate method of cyber self-defense, it becomes clear that a well thought out cyber letter of marque scheme would be able to address the fears that led to the enactment of the CFAA.\nThe current legal framework allows hackers to do what they please,³⁰³ while network owners must follow onerous statutory rules.³⁰⁴ The issuance of cyber letters of marque is a constitutionally authorized method of self-defense Congress should authorize to level the cyber playing field.\n³⁰⁰ “Historian Faye M. Kert offers the judgment that ‘without the presence of the American privateers in the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812, the United States would never have been able to hold off the British Navy.’” SECHREST, supra note 31, at 7.\n³⁰¹ See infra Part III.\n³⁰² This addresses the emotional and intellectually dishonest reactions of “vigilante justice in cyberspace... notions of pirates on the high seas and wild west posses” as voiced by people such as Jim Richards of Tangent Capital. Egan, supra note 293.\n³⁰³ Some complain that to allow active-defense, cyberspace would devolve into a “wild west.” (“Allowing companies an exception to the CFAA really would turn the Internet into the Wild West.”). Westby, supra note 147.\nIt is in many ways the Wild West. Cyberspace has many similarities to a Wild West world... The message of this metaphor for cyberspace security is clear: If there is no way to enforce law and order throughout all of cyberspace, which appears to be the case, one must rely on local enclaves of law and order, and trusted friends.\nRICHARD O. HUNDLEY &amp; ROBERT H. ANDERSON, EMERGING CHALLENGE SECURITY AND SAFETY IN CYBERSPACE 12, reprinted from IEEE TECHNOLOGY AND SOCIETY MAGAZINE (1995/1996). International scholars have also recognized the Wild West nature of the internet.

Kessinger* ## I. Introduction At any given time, millions upon millions of people connect to each other via cyberspace.¹ While a convenient method for grandparents to view pictures of their grandchildren, the Internet is also an exceedingly effective vehicle by which to attack a state, a company, or an individual. These attacks occur with frightening frequency, over 1,000 per hour in Great Britain alone²; and Britain recognizes the severity of the cyber threat.³ In the first four days of the November 2012 fighting between Israel and Gaza militants, over 44 million attacks on Israeli websites⁴ and an estimated 100 million total attacks occurred.⁵ Cyber-attacks cost Australia “an average of $2 million per incident” and exceed a billion dollars per year.⁶ Successful attacks also occur against international bodies, such as the International Atomic Energy Agency.⁷ These cyber attacks seek not only military targets, but also industrial espionage.⁸ Despite the frequency and increasing severity of cyber attacks,⁹ many governments and industries around the world, to include the United States, are either seemingly helpless against the cyber onslaught,¹⁰ too dysfunctional¹¹ to create a useful offensive or defensive cyber scheme,¹² or are “highly immature with limited vision and strategic foresight.”¹³ Some foreign jurisdictions, our allies¹⁴ in the fight against cyber-attacks, fail to stem the tide of these attacks and now punish the cyber victims.¹⁵ This article explores the improbable, if not politically impossible, application of the letter of marque concept to the cyber arena. Despite the likely political stigma such a proposition would have in today’s Congress, letters of marque are nevertheless a constitutional and valid tool to execute cyber operations, and thus worthy of discussion.\nProposed defenses to cyber attacks are becoming increasingly complex and bizarre.¹⁶ However, one * U.S. Army, Judge Advocate.

Militarily, the government retains control over the letter of marque holder (a\"privateer\") and responsibilities as delineated within the express terms of the letter of marque while at the same time broadening the military's reach. As a law enforcement tool, a letter of marque deputizes an individual or company, thus vesting that entity with police powers. This authority allows the privateer to detain targets, bring them before the sovereign, and receive compensation based on successes, much like a bounty hunter. Using civilian forces in a military/national defense context is not a concept limited to antiquity. For example, monitored non-governmental civilian participation in governmental operations exists with private military contractors. The United States spent over $300 billion on military contractors from 2001–2007.\nThere is an apparent aversion to the use of letter of marque and privateers. Various bills introduced throughout the years proposing the revival of letter of marque have stalled or failed outright. Despite the hesitation, letters of marque and privateers served a legitimate military purpose, both in supplementing regular combat forces and crippling enemy commerce while protecting American commerce. A cyber letter of marque would enable a privateer to seize digital assets, disrupt fiscal and communication networks, destroy attacking networks, and act as a cyber bounty hunter.\nApplying a letter of marque scheme to the cyber world would not only provide authority for American companies to defend themselves from cyber threats, but also allow them to take proactive measures to neutralize a cyber threat before it coalesces into danger. In addition to providing requisite authorization, a letter of marque scheme would regulate the conduct of a prospective cyber privateer and ensure accountability to effect compliance with the letter of marque's mandate.\nPart II of this article examines the historical usage of letters of marque and privateers. A brief historical discussion shows the use of letters of marque in national defense. Such historical perspective provides a useful background when considering their application to cyberspace. Part III applies legal and historical principles to a modern letter of marque regime. In particular, the application of letters of marque within the context of existing technologies and proposed authorization and oversight safeguards are examined. The various laws implicated in a modern cyber letter of marque regime are reviewed in Part IV. Finally, Part V addresses the authorizations and oversight necessary to effectively manage a successful, and lawful, cyber letter of marque regime. While not meant to be an exhaustive analysis of all possible facets related to the implementation of a cyber letter of marque regime, this article shows that despite some initial political and legal issues, using a cyber letter of marque can effectively mitigate the threats posed by cyber attacks.\n\n---\n\n## ## B. Legal and Judicial Oversight The legal framework for a workable letter of marque regime already exists under current federal law.²⁷² “Privateering worked only because it was backed by a substantial system of law, not only the common law of property, but also the statutory creations such as admiralty courts and bond requirements.”²⁷³ The federal judiciary is vested with original jurisdiction to determine prizes,²⁷⁴ burdens of proof established,²⁷⁵ the due process rights of both the captor and the captive duly considered,²⁷⁶ and the securitylaw.us/2012/11/30/steven-chabinsky-crowdstrike-ex-fbi-cyber-division-talks-pprivate-sector-cyberdeterrence-at-abas-natsec-law-conference/.\n\n²⁷¹ Brenner, supra note 212.\n²⁷² See, e.g., Commissioning Private Vessels for Seizure of Piratical Vessels, 33 U.S.C. § 386 (2006).\nThe President is authorized to instruct the commanders of the public armed vessels of the United States, and to authorize the commanders of any other armed vessels sailing under the authority of any letters of marquee and reprisal granted by Congress, or the commanders of any other suitable vessels, to subdue, seize, take, and, if on the high seas, to send into any port of the United States, any vessel or boat built, purchased, fitted out, or held as mentions in 33 U.S.C. § 385.\nId.\n²⁷³ Tabarrok, supra note 21, at 572.\n²⁷⁴ Jurisdiction, 10 U.S.C. § 7652 (2006).\n²⁷⁵ See The Resolution, 2 U.S. 19 (U.S. 1781) (holding that the burden of proving a prize was captured lawfully lies with the captors).\n²⁷⁶ The legality of a capture is not determined until a court of competent jurisdiction has issued an order making such a determination. Id. Whether property seized may be confiscated as a prize is a judicial question and each case is to be decided on its own facts. Property Captured by the Potomac Flotilla, 10 Op. Att’y Gen. 467 (1863).\ninterests of the United States represented by a duly appointed authority in the “United States attorney for the district in which the prize cause is adjudicated.”²⁷⁷ In fact, Chapter 655 of 10 U.S.C. contains the entire statutory framework to judicially administer a letter of marque regime.\nHistorical precedence demonstrates that judicial oversight is an effective means to monitor and police privateers. For example, the court invalidated the first two prizes claimed during the War of 1812 because of improperly issued letters of marque.²⁷⁸ Even the venerable USS Constitution was also involved in an illegitimate capture, a situation embarrassingly rectified by the courts.²⁷⁹ Indeed, a rich legal history of privateering cases exists before the United States Supreme Court.²⁸⁰ Some are concerned that the government would not be able to control the behavior of modern privateers, especially in a cyber context.²⁸¹ In reality, these concerns are easily addressed with stiff consequences.²⁸² Penalties can include forfeiture of the bond and any pay due as a result of a successful capture or mission, seizure of assets,²⁸³ debarment from all future government contracts,²⁸⁴ exclusion from future letter of marque commissions, criminal prosecution, and potential tort liability.²⁸⁵ At least two presidents proposed criminal prosecution for misuse of a letter of marque. President Jefferson, a major proponent of privateering during the Revolutionary War,²⁸⁶ declared that individuals operating off the coast without valid commissions be captured and tried as pirates.²⁸⁷ ²⁷⁷ Duties of United States Attorney, 10 U.S.C.A. § 7656 (2012).\n²⁷⁸ Tabarrok, supra note 21, at 568.\n²⁷⁹ The United States paid the owners of the captured ship $11,000 in damages. PETRIE, supra note 122, at 160.\n²⁸⁰ See, e.g., In re The Amiable Isabella, Munos, 19 U.S. 1 (1821); The Adeline, 9 Cranch 244 (1815); The Amy Warwick, 67 U.S. 635 (1862).\n²⁸¹ Brenner, supra note 212.\n²⁸² Richard, supra note 19, at 455.\n²⁸³ In a cyber context, this could include all computers and network capabilities.\n²⁸⁴ 48 C.F.R. §§ 9.406–406-05, (2012).\n²⁸⁵ See The Santissima Trinidad, 20 U.S. 283 (1822) (holding that illegal privateers, whether public or private, “are tortuous—and the original owner is entitled to restitution when brought within our jurisdiction”). Tort liability has real teeth, as government is generally immune from civil suit, whereas a letter of marque holder would not be. See David A. Sklansky, The Private Police, 46 UCLA L. REV. 1165, 1186 (1999); Richard, supra note 19, at 455.\n²⁸⁶ See supra Part II.\n²⁸⁷ UPTON, supra note 57, at 180.\nAUGUST 2013 • THE ARMY LAWYER • DA PAM 27-50-483 President Lincoln made a similar proclamation regarding privateers hired by the Confederate States, as he did not believe the “rebellious” states had legal authority to issue letters of marque.²⁸⁸ According to some scholars, one of the major drawbacks of the traditional letter of marque system was the lack of organization or unified command, control and communication.²⁸⁹ To address this concern, all cyber letter of marque holders would report their activities and progress to a central authority on a regular and recurring basis.²⁹⁰ This central authority would have the ability to terminate the cyber privateer’s commission and/or refer the matter to the Department of Justice for criminal prosecution, should the commissioner act outside the bounds of authority. As this central authority would have an over-arching view of which cyber privateers were acting in which arenas, they could deconflict any possible issues of interrupting law enforcement, intelligence, or national security operations in cyber space. Additionally, purely governmental agencies, such as the National Security Agency, would then be in a better position to work in concert with the cyber privateers to execute specific targeted operations.²⁹¹ ## VI. Conclusion “More destructive cyber weapons are being created every day... [eventually]... those who mean to harm the United States will gain the ability to launch a damaging attack. The United States must develop stronger defenses before this occurs.”²⁹² Despite this threat, the U.S. government seems to be content with merely allowing network owners to “[sit] there... trying to swat away these intrusions.”²⁹³ Industry experts have specifically asked that Congress “provide opportunities and responsibilities to the private sector to hack back.”²⁹⁴ Perhaps in tacit acknowledgement that the private sector is better prepared to handle cyber issues, the United States Air Force solicits private industry for capabilities designed to “destroy, deny, degrade, disrupt, deceive, corrupt, or usurp the adversaries [sic] ability to use the cyberspace domain for his advantage.”²⁹⁵ Additionally, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DAPRA), through its “Plan X,” sought “innovative research proposals” in an effort to “dominate the cyber battle space.”²⁹⁶ Congress has not only denied these requests, while at the same time ignoring the Air Force and DARPA’s proposed use of private industry, but at the same time tied their hands with respect to possible civil and criminal liability.²⁹⁷ Members of Congress have instead suggested legislative mandates requiring “owners and operators of vital infrastructure [to] better protect networks,” or even tax credits as a means of encouraging corporations to establish stricter cyber security safeguards.²⁹⁸ Congress has failed to provide industry with the tools they are desperately asking for: a means in which to protect themselves in a meaningful way.\nPolitical policy makers must understand that “[i]n cyberspace, the offense has the upper hand” and the nation cannot remain secure while hiding behind a mythical all protective firewall.²⁹⁹ Accordingly, Congress should exercise its constitutional authority and authorize the issuance of cyber letters of marque and allow American entities to actively defend themselves in cyber space.\nAs delineated above, the letter of marque has a rich tradition, not only in international and maritime law, but also in American history. Were it not for this power, the United States might not ever have gained her freedom, much less secured it in the War of 1812.³⁰⁰ The United States justly refused to acquiesce to a ban on privateering and that ban is not binding to this day.³⁰¹ As advanced in this article, a cyber letter of marque can, with adequate safeguards in place,³⁰² protect our current infrastructure, obtain information on emerging threats, and then eliminate such threats. Taking into account the current state of the law and the restrictions that prevent an adequate method of cyber self-defense, it becomes clear that a well thought out cyber letter of marque scheme would be able to address the fears that led to the enactment of the CFAA.\nThe current legal framework allows hackers to do what they please,³⁰³ while network owners must follow onerous statutory rules.³⁰⁴ The issuance of cyber letters of marque is a constitutionally authorized method of self-defense Congress should authorize to level the cyber playing field.\n³⁰⁰ “Historian Faye M. Kert offers the judgment that ‘without the presence of the American privateers in the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812, the United States would never have been able to hold off the British Navy.’” SECHREST, supra note 31, at 7.\n³⁰¹ See infra Part III.\n³⁰² This addresses the emotional and intellectually dishonest reactions of “vigilante justice in cyberspace... notions of pirates on the high seas and wild west posses” as voiced by people such as Jim Richards of Tangent Capital. Egan, supra note 293.\n³⁰³ Some complain that to allow active-defense, cyberspace would devolve into a “wild west.” (“Allowing companies an exception to the CFAA really would turn the Internet into the Wild West.”). Westby, supra note 147.\nIt is in many ways the Wild West. Cyberspace has many similarities to a Wild West world... The message of this metaphor for cyberspace security is clear: If there is no way to enforce law and order throughout all of cyberspace, which appears to be the case, one must rely on local enclaves of law and order, and trusted friends.\nRICHARD O. HUNDLEY &amp; ROBERT H. ANDERSON, EMERGING CHALLENGE SECURITY AND SAFETY IN CYBERSPACE 12, reprinted from IEEE TECHNOLOGY AND SOCIETY MAGAZINE (1995/1996). International scholars have also recognized the Wild West nature of the internet. See Richard de Silva, Cyber Law: Navigating the Legalities of Digital Weapons, CYBER DEF. &amp; NETWORK SECURITY, Oct. 2012.\n³⁰⁴ “It’s unfair that hackers can do whatever they want and companies have to follow rules...” said Ronen Kenig, director of security product marketing at Radware.” Egan, supra note 293.\nAUGUST 2013 • THE ARMY LAWYER • DA PAM 27-50-483",

    "Hitting the Cyber Marque: Issuing a Cyber Letter of Marque to Combat Digital Threats\n\n# Major Christopher M. Kessinger*\n\n## I. Introduction\n\nAt any given time, millions upon millions of people connect to each other via cyberspace.¹ While a convenient method for grandparents to view pictures of their grandchildren, the Internet is also an exceedingly effective vehicle by which to attack a state, a company, or an individual. These attacks occur with frightening frequency, over 1,000 per hour in Great Britain alone²; and Britain recognizes the severity of the cyber threat.³ In the first four days of the November 2012 fighting between Israel and Gaza militants, over 44 million attacks on Israeli websites⁴ and an estimated 100 million total attacks occurred.⁵ Cyber-attacks cost Australia “an average of $2 million per incident” and exceed a billion dollars per year.⁶ Successful attacks also occur against international bodies, such as the International Atomic Energy Agency.⁷ These cyber attacks seek not only military targets, but also industrial espionage.⁸\n\nDespite the frequency and increasing severity of cyber attacks,⁹ many governments and industries around the world, to include the United States, are either seemingly helpless against the cyber onslaught,¹⁰ too dysfunctional¹¹ to create a useful offensive or defensive cyber scheme,¹² or are “highly immature with limited vision and strategic foresight.”¹³ Some foreign jurisdictions, our allies¹⁴ in the fight against cyber-attacks, fail to stem the tide of these attacks and now punish the cyber victims.¹⁵\n\nThis article explores the improbable, if not politically impossible, application of the letter of marque concept to the cyber arena. Despite the likely political stigma such a proposition would have in today’s Congress, letters of marque are nevertheless a constitutional and valid tool to execute cyber operations, and thus worthy of discussion.\n\nProposed defenses to cyber attacks are becoming increasingly complex and bizarre.¹⁶ However, one\n\n* U.S. Army, Judge Advocate.

    "historically effective and constitutional$^{17}$ method of conducting both offensive and defensive operations has yet to be applied in a cyber context: the letter of marque.\n\nThis is a method of cyber self-help in which,\n\n[i]n the context of privately conducted cyber attacks, letters or licensing could be used to specify the circumstances under which threat neutralization may be performed for the defense of property, the criteria needed to identify the attacking party with sufficiently high confidence, the evidence needed to make the determination that any given cyber attack posed a threat sufficiently severe as to warrant neutralization, and the nature and extent of cyber attacks conducted to effect threat neutralization.$^{18}$\n\nAt its core, the letter of marque serves both military and law enforcement functions. Militarily, the government retains control over the letter of marque holder (a \"privateer\") and responsibilities as delineated within the express terms of the letter of marque while at the same time broadening the military's reach.$^{19}$ As a law enforcement tool, a letter of marque deputizes an individual or company, thus vesting that entity with police powers.

A brief historical discussion shows the use of letters of marque in national defense. Such historical perspective provides a useful background when considering their application to cyberspace. Part III applies legal and historical principles to a modern letter of marque regime. In particular, the application of letters of marque within the context of existing technologies and proposed authorization and oversight safeguards are examined. The various laws implicated in a modern cyber letter of marque regime are reviewed in Part IV. Finally, Part V addresses the authorizations and oversight necessary to effectively manage a successful, and lawful, cyber letter of marque regime. While not meant to be an exhaustive analysis of all possible facets related to the implementation of a cyber letter of marque regime, this article shows that despite some initial political and legal issues, using a cyber letter of marque can effectively mitigate the threats posed by cyber attacks.\n\n## II. History of Letter of Marque and Privateering\n\nThe concept of allowing private individuals to wage war on a foreign sovereign is not new, nor is it unique to United\n\nAUGUST 2013 • THE ARMY LAWYER • DA PAM 27-50-483",
    "States history. The letter of marque²⁷ and privateering concepts have been a part of both international law and the accepted norms of warfare for centuries,²⁸ despite the Declaration of Paris—which purportedly banned privateering.²⁹ Hugo Grotius, considered by many to be the father of the modern Law of Armed Conflict, noted that letters of marque and reprisal are endorsed by the entirety of the law of nations.³⁰ Historians credit the expansion and development of the Western world from 1600 to 1815 to privateers.³¹\n\nThe letter of marque originally served as a “self-help” authorization, allowing a private individual to seek reprisal against a foreigner who caused him harm.³² Over time, this developed into a government’s authorization to act on its behalf and seize property belonging to an enemy government, usually in the form of ships and cargo.³³ In its most fundamental form, a letter or marque authorized private merchant ships to carry arms in self-defense.³⁴\n\nUpon its founding, due to its small navy,³⁵ not only did the United States employ letters of marque, but it also was “the world’s biggest proponent of privateering.”³⁶ The Continental Congress issued many letters of marque,³⁷ as did individual states.³⁸ In fact, John Adams reportedly called an early letter of marque scheme, the Massachusetts Armed Vessels Act, “one of the most important documents of the Revolution.”³⁹\n\nThomas Jefferson was also an ardent proponent of privateering: “every possible encouragement should be given to privateering in time of war. . . . Our national ships are too few . . . to . . . retaliate the [sic] acts of the enemy. But by licensing private armed vessels, the whole naval force of the nation is truly brought to bear on the foe.”⁴⁰ Jefferson also realized that letters of marque served more than an offensive purpose, detailing how they are also a means of self-defense:\n\nThe ship Jane is an English merchant vessel . . . employed in the commerce between Jamaica and these States. She brought here a cargo of produce . . . and was to take away . . . flour. Knowing of the war when she left Jamaica, and that our coast was lined with small French privateers, she armed for her defense [sic], and took one of those commissions usually called letters of marque. She arrived here safely . . . Can it be necessary to say that a merchant vessel is not a privateer? That though she has arms to defend herself in time of war, in the course of her regular commerce, this no more makes her a privateer, than a husbandman following his plough in time of war, with a knife or pistol in his pocket, is thereby made a soldier. The occupation of a privateer is attack and plunder, that of a merchant\n\nAUGUST 2013 • THE ARMY LAWYER • DA PAM 27-50-483",
    "vessel is commerce and self-preservation.⁴¹\n\nSupport for letters of marque by the founding fathers was not merely philosophical consent. Thomas Paine and George Washington both owned stock in privateering ventures.⁴² Additionally, Benjamin Franklin practically ran his own privateering operation while he was assigned to France.⁴³ While most privateering ventures were for money, Franklin used the captured British ships, goods and men to trade for American prisoners of war.⁴⁴\n\nPrivateering in general weakened an enemy’s economy and its ability to wage war.⁴⁵ The American privateers devastated British commerce, funding the first two years of the war substantially through British captures.⁴⁶ By early 1777, the British had lost 250 ships, resulting in the collapse of several major London-based West India merchant companies.⁴⁷ Within a year, American privateers captured 559 British ships.⁴⁸ Of the approximately 796 British ships captured during the Revolutionary War, American privateers and armed merchant ships accounted for roughly 600.⁴⁹ British merchants, feeling the crippling effect of American privateers,⁵⁰ ensured that “every pressure was brought to bear on Parliament for [the Revolutionary War’s] discontinuance.”⁵¹ Even ships carrying linen from England to Ireland feared the American privateers, to the point of demanding warship escorts.⁵²\n\nAt the outset of the War of 1812, the British Navy consisted of 1,060 warships. In contrast, the United States Navy had only sixteen, including several that were unfit for sea.⁵³ As a consequence, the United States Navy was not considered to be a serious threat to British naval superiority.⁵⁴ In response, Congress passed a statute authorizing the use of privateers, but tightly controlled them.⁵⁵ The President could revoke, “at pleasure,” any letters of marque he issued after June 1812. The applicant had to list specific details about the ship, crew, and owners, and “Ample security” submitted to ensure compliance with both international and United States law. Further, and perhaps most relevant to modern application, the ship commanders were required to keep a detailed log of everything “that occurs, daily, and transmit them to the government,” and regular United States Navy commanders had to examine these logbooks when “meeting the privateer at sea.”⁵⁶ Failure to abide by these rules would mean forfeiture of the bond and “of all interest in any captures which they may make.”⁵⁷\n\nWith this new authorization in hand, American privateers wreaked havoc on British shipping and secured victory in America’s second war for independence.⁵⁸ In the process, privateers tallied $39 million in prizes, or roughly $672.5 million in 2012 dollars.⁵⁹\n\nFollowing the War of 1812, letters of marque did not disappear from the American landscape. President Andrew Jackson, in 1834, discussed the use of letters of marque against France.⁶⁰ Texas, upon declaring independence from Mexico, realized its coast was vulnerable due to a nascent navy. In response, the fledgling Texas legislature began to issue letters of marque with the intent to “protect the coast, harass Mexican shipping, and bring prizes that could be\n\n⁴¹ Richard, supra note 19, at 437 (citing Letter from Thomas Jefferson, to Gouverneur Morris (Aug. 16, 1793)), in 3 MEMOIR, CORRESPONDENCE AND MISCELLANIES FROM THE PAPERS OF THOMAS JEFFERSON 275 (1829).\n\n⁴² Tabarrok, supra note 21, at 567.\n\n⁴³ Id.; see generally WILLIAM BELL CLARK, BEN FRANKLIN’S PRIVATEERS (1956).\n\n⁴⁴ Tabarrok, supra note 21, at 567.\n\n⁴⁵ CARL E.

In all, Texas issued six letters of marque.⁶¹ Similarly, President Polk recognized the lawful ability of Mexico to issue letters of marque during the Mexican American War.⁶²\n\nIn 1856, Britain, France and other titular world powers met in Paris to discuss concerns arising from wartime maritime law.⁶³ France and Great Britain sought to end privateering as they could not effectively control the use of privateers by their enemies, i.e., the United States and Russia.⁶⁴ Great Britain, in particular, recognized privateering as an effective tool of weaker navies that posed a threat to its naval supremacy and sought to contain it.⁶⁵ The result of this meeting was the Paris Declaration of 1856, a document attempting to ban privateering.⁶⁶\n\nThe Paris Declaration contained three major provisions:⁶⁷ the first provided that “[p]rivateering is, and remains, abolished;” the second prevented the seizing of enemy goods on neutral ships; and the third prevented capture of neutral goods on enemy ships.⁶⁸ Most importantly, the Declaration went to great pains to ensure that its provisions did not apply to any nation save signatories.⁶⁹ This provision is important for two reasons.\n\nFirst, it made clear that it was not intended to be a universal ban on privateering, as it only applied to signatory nations at war with other signatories.⁷⁰ Second, as stated in the document, it did not have the power to police the actions of non-signatories.⁷¹\n\nThe United States recognized that this agreement was merely a means for England to maintain maritime supremacy at the expense of nations with a smaller seafaring force, and accordingly, demanded conditions prior to capitulation.⁷² The United States agreed to acquiesce and sign the document only if protection of all non-contraband private property from capture at sea was included.⁷³ The United States reasoned that since all private property is protected on land, “why should it not be [protected] also on the sea?”⁷⁴\n\nWhile the United States wanted to ensure it would be allowed to trade with both sides of a conflict, free from privateer entanglements, another more vital concern existed. According to Secretary of State William L. Marcy, “the United States could not forgo the right to send out privateers, which in the past had proved her most effective maritime weapon in time of war, and which, since she had no large navy, were essential to her fighting power.”⁷⁵ The United States realized that if privateering was banned, its nascent navy⁷⁶ would be no match for the greater naval might of countries such as Britain and France.⁷⁷ As the plenipotentiaries who signed the Declaration would not adequately address American concerns regarding private goods, and factoring in Marcy’s concern about the resulting unequal balance of naval power, the United States refused to sign the agreement.⁷⁸\n\nThe issue of privateering arose again in April 1861 when Confederate President Jefferson Davis, with Confederate Congressional approval,⁷⁹ issued letters of\n\n⁶¹ TEXAS PRIVATEERS, https://www.tsl.state.tx.us/exhibits/navy/privateers.html (last modified Aug. 30, 2011).\n\n⁶² Although President Polk did take issue with the blank letters of marque issued by Mexico, arguing those were illegal under international law and those acting in accordance with such letters are considered to be pirates.

    "marque against Northern shipping.⁸⁰ In accordance with this authorization, the South immediately sought to hire British and French privateers. Perhaps fearing the involvement of the British or French navies in the conflict, the Union declared that it would follow the Declaration and not issue letters of marque and Secretary of State Seward instructed American ambassadors to determine whether the signatories would be amicable to incorporating the proposed changes advocated by Marcy, thus allowing the United States to formally sign the Declaration.⁸¹ As an indication of the Union’s fear of privateers, Secretary Seward authorized acquiescence to the Declaration even if the requested exceptions were not approved.⁸² Britain and France declined the advances and the United States remained a non-signatory.⁸³\n\nConsequently, the Union passed a statutory authorization for President Lincoln to issue letters of marque⁸⁴ and declared that all attempts to disrupt, capture or destroy Union shipping would be treated as piracy and dealt with as such.⁸⁵ Regardless, the British entered the Civil War as privateers, sailing under letters of marque issued by the Confederacy. In fact, in a case brought by the United States against Britain for damages caused by a privateer, an international tribunal found no issue with a non-signatory (the Confederacy) issuing letters of marque to a signatory (Britain) “to construct, furnish, and crew ships to be used in commerce raids against a non-signatory, the United States.”⁸⁶\n\nWhen the United States entered into conflict with the Spanish during the Spanish American War, neither the United States nor Spain was a signatory to the Declaration of Paris.⁸⁷ Not only did Spain specifically reserve the right to issue letters of marque,⁸⁸ the Spanish government recognized\n\nAmerica’s right and ability to issue the same.⁸⁹ The Spanish never carried out the threat, and President McKinley, for the first time, articulated a U.S. intention to comply with the Paris Declaration, though still not be a signatory.⁹⁰\n\nDespite the reluctance, both Spain and the United States found ways to unofficially authorize privateers without formally issuing letters of marque.⁹¹ Both nations organized “auxiliary cruisers of the Navy.”⁹² The United States Navy chartered private merchant ships, heavily armed them, and subsequently entered into naval service.⁹³ The Navy used the ships and manned them with the owner’s regular, ostensibly civilian crew, placing the ships “under the entire control of the senior naval officer on board.”⁹⁴ One such ship, the City of Paris,⁹⁵ actually took prizes, with the United States Prize Court holding that she was not a “vessel of the Navy nor a privateer . . . ”⁹⁶ and finally ruling that she was an “armed vessel in the service of the United States” and the civilian crew was “entitled as of right to share in the prize money.”⁹⁷\n\nWhile the nature of privateering changed with the Spanish-American War, privateering did not disappear. At the 1907 Hague Peace Conference, the United States again voiced its opposition to the privateering prohibition.⁹⁸ Specifically, the United States voiced the same concerns as\n\n⁸⁰ ADAMS, supra note 72, at 141; JAMES D.

    "it did during the original 1856 negotiations,⁹⁹ that “the inviolability of unoffending private property belonging to the enemy on the high seas be guaranteed.”¹⁰⁰ Because other delegates gave no such guarantees, the United States, on two separate occasions, refused to acquiesce, proclaiming that “[i]t is well known that the Government of the United States of America has not adhered to that Declaration.”¹⁰¹ The issue of privateering rested with this last American objection¹⁰² until Congress drafted several bills calling for their reemergence.¹⁰³\n\n## III. Applying Letters of Marque to Cyber Warfare\n\nLetters of marque were the original “self-help” governmental authorization.¹⁰⁴ While used to great effect in the past, they can now be resurrected and used to achieve similar results, especially in a cyber context. This section addresses the use of a cyber letter of marque in three areas: seizing assets; disrupting, disabling, and dismantling adversarial networks; and conducting cyber bounty hunting and rewards programs.\n\n## A. Seizing Assets\n\nIn a modern cyber letter of marque scheme, the U.S. government would authorize certain companies or individuals to track, freeze, and seize the illicit funds of designated criminal organizations. The net effect would be cutting off supplies to deliver the United States from its enemies.¹⁰⁵ For example, the United States has recently named several Russians as “transnational criminals” and promulgated an Executive Order that authorizes “seizure of their assets in the United States and prevents them from banking in dollars anywhere in the world.”¹⁰⁶\n\nWhen rogue states, such as Iran, contravene the will of the international community, the most used method of ensuring compliance is via the United Nations Security Council or unilateral economic sanctions.¹⁰⁷ The United States first instituted sanctions against Iran in 1979, following the seizure of the American Embassy during the Iranian Revolution. These sanctions included freezing roughly $11 billion in Iranian assets.¹⁰⁸ Iran continues to launder and hide money in contravention of these resolutions, often with the help of international banks.¹⁰⁹ In just one instance, the illicit transactions totaled $250 billion.¹¹⁰ Iran has also turned to China, specifically its banking system, for help in escaping economic sanctions.¹¹¹ Illicit money laundering in contravention of United Nations resolutions is not limited to Iran, but has also included North Korea, Cuba, Sudan, and Mexican criminal cartels.¹¹²\n\n⁹⁹ See supra Part II.\n\n¹⁰⁰ CHOATE, supra note 98, at 40.\n\n¹⁰¹ Id.\n\n¹⁰² Some have alleged that blimps operated on the west coast of the United States during World War II pursuant to letters of marque. “The Los Angeles based Resolute was the only airship . . . operated for the Navy under privateer status. . . .” JAMES SHOCK &amp; DAVID SMITH, THE GOODYEAR AIRSHIPS 43 (2002).

    "Money laundering is not exclusive to United Nations resolution violators; illegal activity also includes organized crime and tax evasion schemes.[113] According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), they report an estimated $1.6 trillion dollars in money laundering in 2009 alone.[114] While U.S. law enforcement has had some success in prosecuting international banks with substantial United States ties,[115] less than one per cent of illegal money is seized globally.[116] Seventy per cent of these illicit funds are funneled through the international banking system.[117] \"[T]racking the flows of illicit funds generated by drug trafficking and organized crime and analyzing how they are laundered through the world's financial systems remain daunting tasks.\"[118] When faced with this exorbitant number, the victories scored by the justice system seem hollow. A cyber letter of marque would allow a privateer to seek these illicit funds wherever they may be hidden and either seize them or digitally sequester them for further law enforcement action. Such a cyber letter of marque brings to bear a formidable resource that will increase the likelihood for seizure of illicit funds and the shutdown of avenues for illicit funding.\n\nThe idea of using a letter of marque to effect an economic result is not novel. John Adams, in singing the virtues of privateering, said “[I]t is by cutting off supplies, not by attacks, sieges, or assaults, that I expect deliverance from enemies.”[119] While letters of marque during the\n\nRevolutionary War and the War of 1812 had distinct military objectives, they were \"also a means of commercial warfare conducted for profit.\"[120] Privateers \"were engaged not in patriotic, but business ventures.\"[121] Some privateers amassed great fortunes through their letter of marque commissions,[122] with even the common seaman receiving up to one thousand dollars above his regular wage from just one voyage.[123] The proceeds from captured enemy goods, once sold via the Unites States Prize Courts, were split between the privateer and the sovereign, thus providing a much needed injection of funds to the government and the privateer, while at the same time depriving the enemy of resources.[124]\n\nMotivated by the possibility of retaining a healthy percentage of the roughly $1.6 trillion presently illicitly laundered worldwide, the number of prospective cyber privateers would be legion. Consequently, the United States government would be in a position to demand an exorbitantly high bond, thus guaranteeing that only the most technically proficient and responsible cyber privateers would seek the commission. As for the cyber profiteer, the prospect of sharing a large percentage of the trillions of dollars, not to mention the potential for criminal or tort liability,[125] would ensure strict compliance with the terms of the letter of marque. As the privateer in the 1700s and 1800s provided both a much needed governmental funding stream[126] and served a valid national security function, so too would a modern cyber privateer by removing illicit funds from the hands of organized crime and sanction violators. The end result would be a potential death blow to crime organizations and rogue regimes.\n\nCurrently, the law restricts anyone from attempting to seize assets, whether they belong to the most deplorable rogue regime or the most vicious drug cartel. A cyber letter of marque would vest responsible and vetted entities with authority to digitally seize illicit funds while providing legal protections from criminal and/or civil liability. Current laws restricting attempted seizures would remain in place for those acting without a valid letter of marque or those\n\nAUGUST 2013 • THE ARMY LAWYER • DA PAM 27-50-483",

    "beating.\"¹⁴⁶ Even if the U.S. government takes on a more proactive role in the cyber arena, it is widely accepted that U.S. law enforcement lacks the sufficient number of trained cyber police necessary to effectively engage the current and emerging cyber threats.¹⁴⁷\n\nWhile a lot of “private companies only have simple fire walls that can be overcome [if] the hacker is an expert,”¹⁴⁸ some in the private sector claim to have the skill set required to confront this threat.¹⁴⁹ These attacks continue because, in part, there is no disincentive for the bad actors, as they know nothing will happen to them.¹⁵⁰ However, if the United States authorized tightly controlled offensive cyber capabilities via a congressionally authorized cyber letter of marque, the nation could allow a U.S. cyber entity to neutralize the attacker and their capabilities.¹⁵¹ As a direct consequence, the attacks will most likely cease and the attackers will move to easier targets.¹⁵² In essence, a cyber letter of marque would “arm” U.S. entities, thus allowing them to protect themselves in much the same way the historical letters of marque allowed merchant ships to arm themselves for self-defense purposes.¹⁵³\n\nAs with seizure of assets, ample historical support exists for the use of privateering in the disruption of enemy activity. As discussed previously,¹⁵⁴ American privateers disrupted English commerce to such an extent that several London-based firms went bankrupt.¹⁵⁵ British merchants,\n\ntheir livelihoods so disrupted and, in fact, disabled, put pressure on their own government to end the war and allow the Americans to have their independence.¹⁵⁶ The financial toll on the enemy during the War of 1812 by American privateers was staggering, which in turn had the operative effect of weakening both British naval superiority and morale in England. If privateering proved to be such an effective defensive weapon in a naval context, it can certainly be used in a cyber context where disrupting an enemy’s attack can be done through a keyboard by a handful of individuals instead of through fourteen-gun warships manned by over a hundred crewmen.¹⁵⁷\n\n## C. Cyber Bounty Hunting\n\nThe realm of cyber letters of marque is not limited to offensive or defensive actions in the classic sense. A cyber letter of marque could also be utilized as a method of bounty hunting, providing information to law enforcement agencies necessary to apprehend a cyber attacker.\n\nBounty hunting, like a letter of marque, is an activity intertwined with the history of the United States. The United States Supreme Court endorsed bounty hunting as a legal activity in the 1872 case *Taylor v. Taintor*.¹⁵⁸ The federal government endorsed, and continues to endorse, bounty hunting for capture (as opposed to kill) as exemplified in the most wanted lists.¹⁵⁹ Perhaps most famously, the United\n\n¹⁴⁶ Bardin, *supra* note 13.\n\n¹⁴⁷ *Id.*; Jody Westby, *Caution: Active Response to Cyber Attacks Has High Risk*, FORBES.COM, Nov. 29, 2012, http://www.forbes.com/sites/jodywestby/2012/11/29/caution-active-response-to-cyber-attacks-has-high-risk/.\n\n¹⁴⁸ *N.

This, arguably, would be illegal under current United States law.¹⁷⁰\n\nThe Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) serves as a barrier to a corporation or individual¹⁷¹ from coming to the aid of a cyber-attack victim. Congress could carefully draft cyber letter of marquee legislation authorizing such entities to track and digitally “capture” a cyber criminal or terrorist. The only difference between the reward/bounty programs currently operated by the United States Government and a cyber letter of marque is the antiquated CFAA prohibition.\n\nIndeed, other scholars have posited the use of bounty hunting letters of marque.¹⁷² For example, Robert P. DeWitte, writing in the Indiana Law Journal, discussed one of the potential downfalls between physical, as opposed to virtual, bounty hunting through the use of a letter of marque. In particular, he illuminated the legitimate concern that “state authorities could conceivably attempt to capture and/or kill privateers” in their territory while operating under a valid U.S. letter of marque.¹⁷³ However, this concern in a cyber letter of marque context is not applicable since the cyber privateer/bounty hunter would be safely ensconced in the territorial United States, outside the physical reach of an unfriendly foreign armed force.\n\nJust as letters of marque are constitutional,¹⁷⁴ so too are bounties, as over a hundred years of U.S. jurisprudence demonstrates.¹⁷⁵ The issuance of a cyber letter of marque\n\n¹⁶⁹ See, e.g., NAT’L ASS’N FUGITIVE RECOVERY AGENTS (N.A.F.R.A.), http://fugitive-recovery.org/ (last visited Dec. 24, 2012); NAT’L ASS’N BAIL BOND INVESTIGATORS, http://nabbi.org/ (last visited Dec. 24, 2012).\n\n¹⁷⁰ The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1030 (2006), would most likely prevent a company or individual from taking these steps.

    "does not have to have the “bounty hunter” moniker, as it is analogous to a whistleblower or *qui tam*¹⁷⁶ suit whereby the privateer, minus the constraints of current domestic laws such as the CFAA, may gather information about an attacker or enemy and provide it to the proper authorities in return for monetary compensation. A cyber letter of marque would allow a cyber privateer access to those established and protected legal mechanisms.\n\n## IV. Legal Barriers\n\nDespite the many potential applications of a cyber letter of marque, some arguments raise concerns about the legality of its application. When discussing letters of marque, most commentators cite to the same alleged legal barriers to implementation: domestic law, usually the CFAA; the Law of Armed Conflict, specifically attribution and self-defense concerns; the Paris Declaration of 1856; and the Council of Europe Convention on Cyber-crime. This section examines each of these areas and analyzes why they are not legal barriers to the implementation of a cyber letter of marque regime.\n\n### A. The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act\n\nThe Computer Fraud and Abuse Act,¹⁷⁷ initially a criminal statute protecting government computers and those computers belonging to entities with compelling government interests,¹⁷⁸ forces companies under attack to “just stand and take a beating.”¹⁷⁹ Since its passage in 1984, it has expanded¹⁸⁰ to include civil liability by prohibiting anyone from “intentionally access[ing] a protected computer without authorization or exceed[ing] authorized access . . . [and recklessly causing damage¹⁸¹ involving a loss¹⁸² of] at least\n\n$5,000 in value.”¹⁸³ The definition of a “protected computer” has expanded to cover not only U.S. government computers, but also any computer “used in a manner that affects interstate or foreign commerce.”¹⁸⁴ Even those computers located outside the United States are protected.¹⁸⁵ Potentially, every single computer connected to the internet anywhere in the world would be a “protected computer” pursuant to the CFAA,¹⁸⁶ including, potentially, a blue-tooth-enabled garage door opener or coffeemaker in suburbia.¹⁸⁷\n\nWhile the CFAA prohibits the mere access to a protected computer, causing damage seems to be the lynchpin to triggering civil and criminal penalties under the CFAA. Some courts have homed in on the damage requirement, refusing to find civil or criminal liability. For example, in *Moulton v. VC3*,¹⁸⁸ the court held that an unauthorized port scan and throughput test of a defendant’s servers is not a violation of the CFAA¹⁸⁹ since no “damage” was caused. Likewise, in *United States v. Czubinski*,¹⁹⁰ the court reversed the criminal conviction of an IRS agent who accessed a “protected computer” to satisfy his curiosity.¹⁹¹\n\nWhile some of the judicial decisions seem to allow some degree of cyber intelligence collection under the current regulatory scheme,¹⁹² the courts clearly would not allow an entity to seize assets, whether they are being laundered at a major international bank or if information leading to their location is on a drug kingpin’s desktop\n\n¹⁷⁶ 31 U.S.C. §§ 3729–3733 (2006).\n\n¹⁷⁷ 18 U.S.C. § 1030 (2006).\n\n¹⁷⁸ This included not only government computers and networks, but also those of large banks, the New York Stock Exchange, etc. Robert B.

    "computer. Consequently, government authorization would first be a necessity.¹⁹³\n\nDespite allowing for criminal and civil penalties, the CFAA is not an effective means of preventing cyber attacks.¹⁹⁴ Some have argued that active-defense authorizations, such as a letter of marque, are not necessary as the cyber victim can turn over evidence of a cyber attack to the FBI for prosecution.¹⁹⁵ While this might work in theory, in actual practice it leaves the cyber victim virtually remediless for a host of reasons. For one, law enforcement personnel are questionably competent when it comes to cyber attacks and cyber crime.¹⁹⁶ Further, due to the global nature of cyber attacks, an American court might have a difficult time bringing a cyber attacker within its jurisdiction.¹⁹⁷ Even if a cyber attack victim captures all the information necessary to conduct a thorough law enforcement investigation, the FBI has bungled such gift-wrapped cyber cases in the past.¹⁹⁸\n\nJust as cyber criminals are capable of seizing money from an individual’s bank accounts,¹⁹⁹ cyber companies with the technical expertise can track down and seize illicit funds, given the proper governmental authorization. A cyber letter of marque would provide such authorization.\n\n## B. Attribution and Self-Defense\n\nAttribution is the legal requirement to positively identify the attacker prior to responding with force in self-defense.²⁰⁰ How does a prospective cyber privateer ensure it is striking the proper target²⁰¹ and how does a cyber-privateer cover their tracks so as to not entice further attacks? Admittedly, discovering the source of a cyber attack is “the most important aspect of active defense.”²⁰² It necessarily must be a requirement when issuing a cyber letter of marque to ensure that the privateer is targeting the proper bad actor. Critics have complained that it is too difficult to identify the attacker with sufficient accuracy to ensure a counter-attack is accurately aimed.²⁰³ While tracing an attack may not provide actionable results, and some technologies “limit the ability to make perfect surgical strikes with active defense,”²⁰⁴ the problem may not be as big as it appears. Some speculate that it is more difficult for the bad actor to identify the cyber privateer than it is for the cyber privateer to identify the bad actor.²⁰⁵\n\nThe attribution concerns may, however, be a bit overblown.²⁰⁶ Even the Russian cyber attacks launched or encouraged against Estonia could be traced back to the “Russian intelligence apparatus.”²⁰⁷ In fact, “attribution to at least some level will almost always be possible.”²⁰⁸ While the exact technologies available to ensure accurate attribution, which can be done in seconds, are not the focus of this paper, such technology is not new and “is currently the subject of a significant amount of research aimed at improving accuracy and efficiency.”²⁰⁹ While it may not be feasible, or even possible, to accurately attribute 100 million cyber attacks,²¹⁰ “it is clear that the current state of the\n\n¹⁹³ See, e.g., NRC REPORT, supra note 18 (discussing the exemption for lawfully authorized law enforcement and intelligence agencies activities to the CFAA and how government agencies may commandeer private computes or pay for their usage).\n\n¹⁹⁴ See supra Part I (discussing of the frequency of cyber attacks). The CFAA, in one form or another, has been in effect since 1984.

    "technology is adequately advanced to permit the discussion of active defense to move forward into an evaluation of how an active defense scheme should be implemented.”²¹¹\n\n## C. Paris Declaration of 1856\n\nMost critics of the letter of marque, regardless of its application, usually point to the Paris Declaration of 1856, noting that the United States is prohibited from employing privateers due to the agreement.²¹² This argument, however, is without merit.\n\nFirst, the Declaration does not apply to the United States per the plain language of the treaty. “The present Declaration is not and shall not be binding, except between those Powers who have acceded, or shall accede, to it.”²¹³ The United States did not accede to it in 1856 and has not, in the ensuing 157 years, acceded to it. Under the rules of treaty interpretation,²¹⁴ a treaty is binding only upon parties to it,²¹⁵ and it “does not create either obligations or rights for a third State without its consent.”²¹⁶ Further, in order to impose an obligation on a third State, it must “expressly accept that obligation in writing.”²¹⁷ To date, the United States has not consented to the obligations of the Declaration in writing, as required by the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.\n\nAdditionally, the Declaration clearly pertains, and limits itself, to maritime law.²¹⁸ Since a cyber letter of marque regime is not grounded in maritime law and letters of marque are specifically authorized in the United States Constitution, it is permissible under international law, Paris Declaration notwithstanding, to issue cyber letters of marque.\n\nOthers argue²¹⁹ that the Declaration has become customary international law.²²⁰ While this might be true at first blush, it ignores the legal and historical fact. A nation, not otherwise bound by a treaty, does not become bound by operation of the rule of customary international law if it has been a persistent objector. In order to be considered a persistent objector, and therefore not bound by a treaty, the State “must have objected to the emergence of a new norm during its formation and continue to object afterwards.”²²¹ Even if it has been state practice to follow the precepts in a treaty, non-signatory states can alter their actions in order to confront new threats.²²²\n\nRegarding the Declaration of Paris, the United States objected during the formation of the proposed privateering ban²²³ and objected to the Declaration by passing legislation authorizing privateers during the Civil War;²²⁴ the Spanish government recognized America’s right to issue letters of marque during the Spanish-American War,²²⁵ and voiced opposition at the 1907 Hague Peace Conference.²²⁶ Clearly, the United States has been a persistent objector to the Declaration and thus not bound by it. Simply stated, American privateering declined not because of acquiescence to international treaties which it did not, and had no intent to, sign. Rather, privateering declined because America, after 1898, no longer had a nascent navy, had become a major\n\nAUGUST 2013 • THE ARMY LAWYER • DA PAM 27-50-483",
    "naval power,²²⁷ and the “cost-saving advantages of privateering [had] declined.”²²⁸\n\nAssuming, *arguendo*, that the Paris Declaration is customary international law that the United States must follow, the issuance of cyber letters of marque is still not banned. The Declaration never defines privateers.²²⁹ As history demonstrates, a contracted civilian ship can be armed, staffed with civilians, fight, and take prizes—all without violating the Declaration.²³⁰\n\n## D. The Council of Europe Convention on Cyber-Crime²³¹\n\nOn 23 November 2001, the United States signed on to the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime.²³² The Cybercrime Convention came into effect in the United States on 1 January 2007.²³³ The Cybercrime Convention’s main objective “is to pursue a common criminal policy aimed at the protection of society against cyber-crime, especially by adopting appropriate legislation and fostering international co-operation.”²³⁴ It purports to allow countries to work together through substantive, procedural, and jurisdictional laws against a cyber criminal committing crimes in one country while physically located in another.²³⁵ Prior to the Cybercrime Convention (and some would argue even today),²³⁶ the cyber police forces in the United States or internationally did not have the tools or authority necessary to combat cyber-attacks. Additionally, it did not address the\n\ncultural issues that may arise from crimes committed in cyberspace.²³⁷ To make matters worse, some countries did not have adequate laws against cyber-crime.²³⁸\n\nAn attempt to correct these law enforcement deficiencies was the impetus for the creation of the Cybercrime Convention. It remains the only international treaty attempting to deal with the issue of transcontinental cyber attacks.²³⁹ It fails, however, to effectively protect anyone from cyber attacks. It is largely a symbolic document, serving mainly to reassure the public that governments are doing *something* to address the threat.²⁴⁰ Those reassurances are hollow, as only roughly half of the ratifying states have passed domestic legislation required to enforce the document.²⁴¹\n\nRemarkably, the exceptions contained in the Cybercrime Convention negate its impact. First, no requirement exists that any cyber attacker actually be prosecuted; instead, the State must merely “report the final outcome to the requesting Party [i.e., the cyber victim’s nation] in due course.”²⁴² In addition, nearly every enforcement provision of the Cybercrime Convention contains a legislative flaw, allowing a nation state to refuse to cooperate.²⁴³ A nation may refuse a request for assistance during or after a cyber attack emanating from its country for a host of reasons. These reasons include, but are not limited to²⁴⁴: if a request for assistance would violate domestic laws,²⁴⁵ if a request for assistance and information gained\n\nAUGUST 2013 • THE ARMY LAWYER • DA PAM 27-50-483",
    "therefrom could be used in any investigation or court proceedings other than those listed in the request,²⁴⁶ or if an attacked nation believes there are political issues at play.²⁴⁷\n\nPerhaps as a sign of the naïve belief that the feckless Cybercrime Convention will actually curb cyber attacks, the Council of Europe’s Committee of Experts on Terrorism opined in February 2010 that no further conventions are needed to address cyber terrorism because “large scale attacks on computer systems appeared to be already covered by the Cybercrime Convention.”²⁴⁸ Yet two days later, on 18 February 2010, The Washington Post broke the story that more than 75,000 computers and roughly 2,500 companies in the United States, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Turkey, and Mexico were victims of “one of the largest and most sophisticated attacks by cyber criminals discovered to date.”²⁴⁹ The attack began in 2008 and was not discovered until January 2010.²⁵⁰\n\nIn the United States, an unnamed Department of Justice official purportedly alleged that the “impact of the convention [is] ‘very positive,’” which, again, seems to ignore the reality of cyber attack’s scope.²⁵¹ To the contrary, the Cybercrime Convention seems to merely limit the ability of a law-abiding entity to take proactive steps necessary to cease a cyber threat.²⁵²\n\nBecause the Cybercrime Convention does not diminish cyber attacks, lacks any enforcement or prosecution mechanism and expressly states that signatory states pass domestic criminal laws covering “illegal access,”²⁵³ “illegal interception,”²⁵⁴ criminal “misuse of devices,”²⁵⁵ [emphasis added], the United States is not prevented from issuing letters of marque. If Congress exercised its constitutionally authorized power to issue letters of marque, limited to cyber operations, no violation of any provision of the Convention would occur because no domestic criminal acts occur.\n\nEven the U.S. Attorney General stated, in 2006, that the Cybercrime Convention “is in full accord with all U.S. Constitutional protections.”²⁵⁶ The activity undertaken pursuant to a constitutionally authorized and congressionally endorsed cyber letter of marque would not, under United States law, be illegal and thus not a violation of any provision contained in the Cybercrime Convention. In short, a cyber letter of marque issued by Congress would not violate the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime.\n\n## V. Authorizations and Oversight\n\nWhile a cyber letter of marque is legal, both under domestic and international law, any cyber letter of marque regime must provide for a method of authorizing and subsequently supervising a cyber privateer. This section discusses some potential methods of authorization and oversight necessary for an effective cyber letter of marque regime.\n\n## A. Issuance of Bonds and Authorizations\n\nPrior to the issuance of a letter of marque, all prospective cyber privateers should be required to register with a central governmental database. This database would provide the supervising agency²⁵⁷ with a means of not only policing cyber privateers and holding them accountable, but also a means for parties allegedly aggrieved by United States authorized cyber privateers to seek redress. Such a database and registration would also allow the supervisory agency an opportunity to vet the putative cyber privateer. “If a company does not have the skills to defend its systems, it likely does not have the skills to attack back—or make\n\nAUGUST 2013 • THE ARMY LAWYER • DA PAM 27-50-483\n\n246 This provision, in effect, means that if the information leads to more criminals, and a nation wants to prosecute them, it may not use this information in that investigation/prosecution.

They do not recognize our virtual boards or virtual sovereignty as it is. Why would they recognize a convention on cyber crime?

    "decisions about whether to engage in such actions.”²⁵⁸ If the applicant does not possess the requisite skills, then its request for a cyber letter of marque is denied.²⁵⁹\n\nFurther, all applicants must be able to post a bond commensurate with potential liability exposure. “Letters of marque should only be issued to security firms able to post a significant bond and meet specific qualification and training requirements.”²⁶⁰ The bond requirement is the most effective method for screening out “start-ups” and “fly-by-night” security companies from seeking a letter of marque.²⁶¹ The Act Concerning Letters-of-Marque, Prizes &amp; Prize Goods specifically states that before the issuance of any commission of letters of marque, a bond in the amount of five thousand dollars, or ten thousand dollars if the ship had more than one hundred and fifty men, would have to be paid by two “responsible sureties, not interested in such vessel.”²⁶² The payment of such a steep bond ensures that privateers strictly adhere to congressional rules.²⁶³\n\nIn a cyber context, since the stakes are so high, a prospective cyber privateer should be required to supply a large monetary bond.²⁶⁴ A large monetary bond would not only ensure that responsible entities apply for and receive cyber letters of marque, but also that those with the requisite discretion and technical expertise are the only ones acting with congressional authority as a cyber privateer. The prime importance of competent exercise of the powers enumerated in the letter of marque is underscored when the vast amount of money and intellectual property lost on a frequent and recurring basis, coupled with the exacting nature of establishing positive identification, especially attribution, is contemplated. A large monetary bond would, in effect, keep the cyber cutthroats out of this business.\n\nSingapore established CaseTrust, a similar system, in order to protect consumers engaged in e-commerce. CaseTrust receives complaints against e-vendors and legitimizes member companies. Prior to joining, a\n\nprospective e-vendor must give a banker’s guarantee, or a bond, to establish that it is indeed a legitimate and reputable company. The CaseTrust system provides for compulsory adjudication including the power to not only fine a vendor, but also to revoke its certification. As a result, the consumer is protected by providing a source of bonded companies and a policing mechanism. Additionally, the commercial entities are shrouded with governmental legitimacy. To date, enforcement has been effective and participation is growing.²⁶⁵\n\nIn a historical context, the putative privateer kept detailed daily logs, which were available for inspection by any U.S. naval commander he might encounter.²⁶⁶ Similar requirements would be made of cyber privateers. As all internet activity can be, or actually is, easily monitored,²⁶⁷ this requirement does not place too onerous a burden on the purported cyber privateer. While most private companies are loathe to share details of their cyber activity for fear of losing intellectual property, a competitive edge, or disclose their cyber defenses or weaknesses,²⁶⁸ a company serious about executing a defensive or even offensive cyber letter of marque should be willing to accept the more stringent scrutiny, such as reviewing cyber logbooks.\n\nA cyber letter of marque would designate the bearers to be licensed combatants for the sovereign, authorizing them to “bear arms” in the cyber sense of the word, and either defend against specific attacks and launch counter attacks (back-backs) or engage in offensive cyber operations directed at sovereign selected targets or networks.²⁶⁹ A private company could be granted authorization to conduct a hack-back, temporarily incapacitating a cyber bad actor, and then notify the appropriate law enforcement or national security entity for final apprehension or network termination.²⁷⁰\n\nAUGUST 2013 • THE ARMY LAWYER • DA PAM 27-50-483",
    "In recognition that cyber privateers would, to a certain extent, be bearing arms, a workable set of rules of engagement would necessarily be a major part of the actual commission. Professor Susan Brenner has expressed concerns that cyber privateers could be motivated to vigilantism and exceed the bounds of their charter, exhibiting an inability to determine who is a just target.²⁷¹ These concerns can be easily alleviated by carefully drafted rules of engagement and scope of authorization in the letter of marque commission itself. If cyber privateers exceed the scope of the commission, they lose their substantial bond, face debarment from future government contracts, and open themselves up to potential criminal prosecutions since their actions were outside the scope of the immunity granted by the letter of marque. These adverse ramifications should keep a vetted and approved cyber privateer in line.\n\n## B. Legal and Judicial Oversight\n\nThe legal framework for a workable letter of marque regime already exists under current federal law.²⁷² “Privateering worked only because it was backed by a substantial system of law, not only the common law of property, but also the statutory creations such as admiralty courts and bond requirements.”²⁷³ The federal judiciary is vested with original jurisdiction to determine prizes,²⁷⁴ burdens of proof established,²⁷⁵ the due process rights of both the captor and the captive duly considered,²⁷⁶ and the\n\nsecuritylaw.us/2012/11/30/steven-chabinsky-crowdstrike-ex-fbi-cyber-division-talks-pprivate-sector-cyberdeterrence-at-abas-natsec-law-conference/.\n\n²⁷¹ Brenner, supra note 212.\n\n²⁷² See, e.g., Commissioning Private Vessels for Seizure of Piratical Vessels, 33 U.S.C. § 386 (2006).\n\nThe President is authorized to instruct the commanders of the public armed vessels of the United States, and to authorize the commanders of any other armed vessels sailing under the authority of any letters of marquee and reprisal granted by Congress, or the commanders of any other suitable vessels, to subdue, seize, take, and, if on the high seas, to send into any port of the United States, any vessel or boat built, purchased, fitted out, or held as mentions in 33 U.S.C. § 385.\n\nId.\n\n²⁷³ Tabarrok, supra note 21, at 572.\n\n²⁷⁴ Jurisdiction, 10 U.S.C. § 7652 (2006).\n\n²⁷⁵ See The Resolution, 2 U.S. 19 (U.S. 1781) (holding that the burden of proving a prize was captured lawfully lies with the captors).\n\n²⁷⁶ The legality of a capture is not determined until a court of competent jurisdiction has issued an order making such a determination. Id. Whether property seized may be confiscated as a prize is a judicial question and each case is to be decided on its own facts. Property Captured by the Potomac Flotilla, 10 Op.

For example, the court invalidated the first two prizes claimed during the War of 1812 because of improperly issued letters of marque.²⁷⁸ Even the venerable USS Constitution was also involved in an illegitimate capture, a situation embarrassingly rectified by the courts.²⁷⁹ Indeed, a rich legal history of privateering cases exists before the United States Supreme Court.²⁸⁰\n\nSome are concerned that the government would not be able to control the behavior of modern privateers, especially in a cyber context.²⁸¹ In reality, these concerns are easily addressed with stiff consequences.²⁸² Penalties can include forfeiture of the bond and any pay due as a result of a successful capture or mission, seizure of assets,²⁸³ debarment from all future government contracts,²⁸⁴ exclusion from future letter of marque commissions, criminal prosecution, and potential tort liability.²⁸⁵\n\nAt least two presidents proposed criminal prosecution for misuse of a letter of marque. President Jefferson, a major proponent of privateering during the Revolutionary War,²⁸⁶ declared that individuals operating off the coast without valid commissions be captured and tried as pirates.²⁸⁷\n\n²⁷⁷ Duties of United States Attorney, 10 U.S.C.A. § 7656 (2012).\n\n²⁷⁸ Tabarrok, supra note 21, at 568.\n\n²⁷⁹ The United States paid the owners of the captured ship $11,000 in damages.

    "President Lincoln made a similar proclamation regarding privateers hired by the Confederate States, as he did not believe the “rebellious” states had legal authority to issue letters of marque.²⁸⁸\n\nAccording to some scholars, one of the major drawbacks of the traditional letter of marque system was the lack of organization or unified command, control and communication.²⁸⁹ To address this concern, all cyber letter of marque holders would report their activities and progress to a central authority on a regular and recurring basis.²⁹⁰ This central authority would have the ability to terminate the cyber privateer’s commission and/or refer the matter to the Department of Justice for criminal prosecution, should the commissioner act outside the bounds of authority. As this central authority would have an over-arching view of which cyber privateers were acting in which arenas, they could deconflict any possible issues of interrupting law enforcement, intelligence, or national security operations in cyber space. Additionally, purely governmental agencies, such as the National Security Agency, would then be in a better position to work in concert with the cyber privateers to execute specific targeted operations.²⁹¹\n\n## VI. Conclusion\n\n“More destructive cyber weapons are being created every day . . . [eventually] . . . those who mean to harm the United States will gain the ability to launch a damaging attack. The United States must develop stronger defenses before this occurs.”²⁹² Despite this threat, the U.S. government seems to be content with merely allowing network owners to “[sit] there . . . trying to swat away these intrusions.”²⁹³ Industry experts have specifically asked that Congress “provide opportunities and responsibilities to the private sector to hack back.”²⁹⁴\n\nPerhaps in tacit acknowledgement that the private sector is better prepared to handle cyber issues, the United States Air Force solicits private industry for capabilities designed to “destroy, deny, degrade, disrupt, deceive, corrupt, or usurp the adversaries [sic] ability to use the cyberspace domain for his advantage.”²⁹⁵\n\nAdditionally, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DAPRA), through its “Plan X,” sought “innovative research proposals” in an effort to “dominate the cyber battle space.”²⁹⁶ Congress has not only denied these requests, while at the same time ignoring the Air Force and DARPA’s proposed use of private industry, but at the same time tied their hands with respect to possible civil and criminal liability.²⁹⁷ Members of Congress have instead suggested legislative mandates requiring “owners and operators of vital infrastructure [to] better protect networks,” or even tax credits as a means of encouraging corporations to establish stricter cyber security safeguards.²⁹⁸ Congress has failed to provide industry with the tools they are desperately asking for: a means in which to protect themselves in a meaningful way.\n\nPolitical policy makers must understand that “[i]n cyberspace, the offense has the upper hand” and the nation cannot remain secure while hiding behind a mythical all protective firewall.²⁹⁹ Accordingly, Congress should exercise its constitutional authority and authorize the\n\n22\n\nAUGUST 2013 • THE ARMY LAWYER • DA PAM 27-50-483",

Were it not for this power, the United States might not ever have gained her freedom, much less secured it in the War of 1812.³⁰⁰ The United States justly refused to acquiesce to a ban on privateering and that ban is not binding to this day.³⁰¹ As advanced in this article, a cyber letter of marque can, with adequate safeguards in place,³⁰² protect our current infrastructure, obtain information on emerging threats, and then eliminate such threats.
