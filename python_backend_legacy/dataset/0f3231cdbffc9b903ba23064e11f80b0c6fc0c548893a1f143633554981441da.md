The institution of responsibility is at the heart of international law and is part of the constitution of the international community. This being said, cyberspace poses numerous challenges to international law's central objective of ensuring responsibility.'515\nRussell Buchan and Nicholas Tsagourias, 'Special Issue: Non-State Actors and Responsibility in Cyberspace: State Responsibility, Individual Criminal Responsibility and Issues of Evidence', Journal of Conflict &amp; Security Law 21 (3) (2016), 371-381: 377.\nCHAPTER 11 | Pulling the strings in cyberspace\n# Introduction\nNowadays, both state and non-state actors have various technical tools at their disposal that can be used in theory, and are used in practice, to conduct operations in cyberspace with the aim of harming interests of other states and inter alia causing damage to their infrastructures.[516] These so-called 'cyber operations' (COs) are a notion that has a broader scope than the terms 'cyber warfare'[517] or 'cyber war' often used in the literature. This notion is used throughout the Tallinn Manual 2.0 that has been drafted by a group of highly qualified legal experts and clarifies how international law applies to cyberspace.[518] COs are carried out not only in the context of armed conflicts but also in times of peace, and fall under different legal regimes, including humanitarian and human rights law.[519] They are defined as operations that involve the employment of capabilities aimed at achieving certain objectives in or through cyberspace.[520] 'Cyberspace' can be understood as both the physical and non-physical domain consisting in part or in whole of some essential components such as computer systems, communications networks, software, digital information including content and traffic data, and persons and entities using these data.[521]\nA series of distributed denial-of-service attacks were carried out in January 2022 by hackers allegedly affiliated with the Russian government against Ukraine.[522] In April 2022—15 years after the digital attacks[523] on Estonia that,\n516 Samuli Haataja, Cyber Attacks and International Law on the Use of Force: The Turn to Information Ethics.

Importantly, the practice of launching cyber-attacks reveals that states operating in the international arena may use proxies and violate international law without facing responsibility for malicious cyber actors' activities, while at the same time achieving their strategic objectives and advancing their interests.525 In other words, states are capable of acting as 'puppeteers', hiding behind their 'puppets' in the dark of cyberspace and escaping any form of responsibility.526\nThe current contribution investigates the issue of state responsibility for the involvement of states in COs by approaching this subject from the angle of legal attribution. More particularly, it explores the level of state control that is required for attributing operations of private actors posing cyber threats,[527] such as individual hackers and hackers' groups, to states exercising control over them. This study proposes to take into account customary international law that does not prescribe a specific test for examining the degree of state control in the physical world or in cyberspace in every single instance of determining whether an internationally wrongful act has been committed. It argues that there is a need to reconsider the application of the existing control theories in the light of the current realities in order to assess the possibility of legal attribution and assigning responsibility to states exercising varying degrees of control. In addition, it uses the proposed approach for determining the level of state control by applying it to the facts of the case study on the infamous Stuxnet attack involving state actors, which could be seen as a violation of international law.\nThe next section of this chapter gives a brief overview of the doctrine of state responsibility in relation to COs and touches on a number of attribution modes.\n524 Ryan Gallagher, 'Russian hackers tried damaging power equipment, Ukraine says', Bloomberg (12 April 2022), available at: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-04-12/russian-hackers-tried-damaging-power-equipment-ukraine-says?srnd=technology-vp\n525 Tim Maurer, Cyber Mercenaries: The State, Hackers, and Power (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2018), 22-25.\n526 Rebecca Crootof, 'International cybertorts: expanding state accountability in cyberspace', Cornell Law Review 103 (3) (2018), 565, 569.\n527 Ducheine et al. (see note 5 above), 106.\nCHAPTER 11 | Pulling the strings in cyberspace\nThe section following it deals with the control theories that have been articulated by two international judicial bodies: the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY). In addition, it explains how the question of control should be approached by using the two abovementioned control tests. Then, the findings of the previous sections are used to shed light on the issue of attribution in the case study conducted on Stuxnet. The final section provides a conclusion.\n# State responsibility\nFirst and foremost, cyberspace does not exist in a legal vacuum and international law regulates activities taking place in this 'fifth domain' of warfare existing alongside the domains of sea, land, air and space.528 This means that secondary rules of international law—the law of state responsibility—find application in operations originating in cyberspace, in addition to primary rules of numerous treaties and customary international law.529 International responsibility rules and principles had been laid down in the (Draft) Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (ARSIWA) by the International Law Commission, and the UN General Assembly took note of this important document in its resolution.530 The commission of such acts by states triggers their international responsibility, as indicated by the basic principle of Article 1 ARSIWA, which has been widely applied by international judicial bodies. As a result, new legal relationships between states arise under international law and bring about certain legal consequences, such as an obligation of making reparations for the damage incurred. An internationally wrongful act of a state has been committed if conduct is attributable to the state in question under international law and constitutes a breach of an international obligation of that state, according to\n528 Schmitt (see note 4 above), 3, 12; United Nations, Report of the Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, UN Doc.

A/56/83.\nResponsible behaviour in cyberspace | Global narratives and practice\nArticle 2 ARSIWA. On the one hand, attribution—the subjective element—means that an action or omission of an individual or a group of individuals through whom states act must be attached to a state as a subject of international law, so that it is perceived as a state act.[531] On the other hand, a breach as the objective element entails a violation of international law consisting of not only treaty but also non-treaty state obligations in which a state engages, such as using force contrary to Article 2(4) UN Charter.[532]\nAttribution is a multi-layered process including different dimensions.[533] Firstly, there is technical attribution that is far from unproblematic due to inter alia the use of botnets and IP spoofing and is concerned with identifying the actual perpetrators of COs by using a variety of technical tools and techniques in the context of forensic investigations.[534] Secondly, political attribution deals with connecting harmful activities in the cyber domain to states or entities associated with them. It is performed at the political level, where political consequences of COs and possible retaliation play the core role.[535] Political attribution does not by definition carry the intention of holding other states responsible.[536] This is what legal attribution is used for: assigning international responsibility to states that are to a certain degree involved in COs.[537] It is obvious that the process of legally attributing malicious cyber activities to states is dependent on the output of technical attribution in the form of forensic evidence needed for establishing who the involved states and non-state actors are and what their specific relationships are. Legal attribution is also closely linked to public attribution and both may form part of states' attribution efforts, having not only technical and operational but also strategic levels and resulting in communication to the public, politicians and others.[538] In general, states cannot be held responsible for the conduct of\nUNGA, Report of the International Law Commission – Fifty-Third Session, 35, paras 4–6.\nIbid., paras 7-8.\nNicholas Tsagourias, 'Cyber attacks, self-defence and the problem of attribution', Journal of Conflict and Security Law 17 (2) (2012), 229-244: 233.\nHeather Harrison Dinniss, Cyber Warfare and the Laws of War (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2012), 99-102; Nicholas Tsagourias and Michael Farrell, 'Cyber attribution: technical and legal approaches and challenges', European Journal of International Law 31 (3) (2020), 941-976: 942; Marco Roscini, Cyber Operations and the Use of Force in International Law (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2014), 33; Jack Goldsmith, 'How cyber changes the laws of war', European Journal of International Law 24 (1) (2013), 129-138: 135; Tsagourias (see note 19 above), 233.\nJon R.

Legal attribution or imputation in the law of state responsibility is in essence 'the operation of attaching a given action or omission to a State'.[539]\nThere are four modes of legal attribution derived from customary international law that are of utmost importance to the engagement of states in COs. The first attribution mode, found in Article 4 ARSIWA, concerns the conduct of state organs, such as the armed forces, constituting state acts on the basis of international law.[540] In this regard, functions exercised by state organs are irrelevant, similarly to their positions within the state machinery.[541] What is of relevance is that the status of a state organ must be conferred on a person or an entity by the national law of that state. The second attribution modality is Article 5 ARSIWA, dealing with the conduct of persons or entities that are empowered by the domestic law of a state to exercise elements of the governmental authority and actually act in that capacity. If semi-public entities, private companies and others are involved in COs, are tasked by the internal law of a state with carrying out governmental functions and act in breach of international obligations of that state, the latter can be held responsible.[542] The third applicable type of attribution is Article 11 ARSIWA, dealing with situations when non-state actors' actions or omissions are acknowledged and adopted by a state as its own.[543] This should not be a sole support of such conduct but a state is required to consider it as its own and, for instance, take steps to ensure that the conduct does not stop.[544] Clearly, in practice states would rarely go as far as to use their official organs and individuals or entities exercising governmental authority to directly conduct COs violating international law or to acknowledge and adopt such operations as their own. If they do, however, the attribution grounds presented in Articles 4, 5 and 11 ARSIWA will be expected to be applicable and the application of these\n539 UNGA (see note 17 above), 36, para. 12.\n540 Schmitt (see note 4 above), 87-9, paras 1-7; Michael N.

Both theories are discussed in the context of state responsibility in the original Tallinn Manual, but the 2.0 version mentions only the ICJ's perspective and its approach as seemingly the leading theory for attribution on the basis of control without much further explanation.[550]\nIn its judgment in the Nicaragua case, the ICJ held that the conduct of contras would trigger international responsibility of the US if it was proved that the state had effectively controlled the military or paramilitary operations during which\n545 Kubo Mačák, 'Decoding Article 8 of the International Law Commission's Articles on State Responsibility: attribution of cyber operations by non-state actors', Journal of Conflict and Security Law 21 (3) (2016), 405-428: 426; Delerue (see note 26 above), 150; Schmitt (see note 4 above), 95-99, paras 1-14.\n546 Crawford (see note 27 above), 144.\n547 United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran (United States of America v.

The ‘effective control’ test has a significantly high threshold⁵⁵² and is hard to satisfy in practice: it requires a state to effectively determine how COs breaching its international law obligations are to be conducted and to monitor their execution on a continuous basis.⁵⁵³ In the judgment in the Bosnian Genocide case, the ICJ stated that the effective control theory is the one to be followed for the purposes of Article 8 ARSIWA rather than the easier to meet ‘overall control’ test enunciated by the ICTY in the Tadić decision.⁵⁵⁴ Although the discussion might seem to have ended there, much can be said about the necessity for applying a control theory with a lower threshold that would not allow states to escape international responsibility by using non-state actors controlled by them.\nIt follows from the reasoning of the ICTY’s Appeals Chamber that the required level of state control over individuals and groups of individuals is different in nature: this idea was supported by the vice-president of the ICJ, Awn Shawkat Al-Khasawneh, in the Bosnian Genocide case, who drew attention to the fact that ‘the test of control is a variable one’.⁵⁵⁵ In this regard, two factual scenarios should be distinguished in cyberspace: (1) private individuals or unorganised groups of individuals conducting COs and engaging in violations of international law on behalf of states;⁵⁵⁶ (2) organised and hierarchically structured groups of individuals committing those violations.⁵⁵⁷ The first situation would require the degree of state control over COs to be effective in order to make legal attribution possible. For the second scenario, state control of an overall character over\n⁵⁵¹ Case Concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v.

An argument can be made that synchronously with numerous technological developments taking place nowadays, the law of international responsibility, including attribution rules, which is based in customary international law, is constantly evolving and should not be considered static. The adoption of more flexible attribution standards can, for instance, be observed in the area of anti-terrorism.562\nBy acknowledging the widespread reliance of states on ICT and rethinking the existing international law rules and principles, the focus must be put back on the overall control theory. This control test is supported by state and judicial practice,563 has a lower threshold564 than the effective control theory and can be useful in establishing the actual close relationship between states and organised and hierarchically structured groups acting in cyberspace. Such groups must,\n558 Ibid., 56, para. 131; Roscini (see note 20 above), 37.\n559 Tadic judgment, 58-59, para. 137.\n560 Crawford (see note 27 above), 147.\n561 William Banks, 'State responsibility and attribution of cyber intrusions after Tallinn 2.0', Texas Law Review 95 (7) (2017), 1511; Margulies (see note 14 above), 500; Antonio Cassese, 'The Nicaragua and Tadic tests revisited in light of the ICJ judgment on genocide in Bosnia', European Journal of International Law 18 (4) (2007), 649-668: 654; Tadic judgment, 49-50, para. 121.\n562 Derek Jinks, 'State responsibility for the acts of private armed groups', Chicago Journal of International Law 4 (1) (2003), 88-9.\n563 Tadic judgment, 51-62, paras 124-145.\n564 Delerue (see note 26 above), 134.\nCHAPTER 11 | Pulling the strings in cyberspace\n209\nhowever, have a structure, a chain of command, a set of rules of operation and certain outward symbols of authority, as stated by the ICTY.565 It should not be forgotten that the Tadić decision was rendered more than two decades ago, when cyber-attacks were not a widespread threat,566 which is a lifetime in the realm of technology: therefore, it could be argued that the elements of the overall control test should be re-evaluated. Currently, not only typical armed groups but also hackers' collectives and other groups involved in COs can be highly organised and have hierarchical structures.\nA structure that a group has does not need to be of military nature. Arguably, a degree of organisation making group members understand their position and function within a group would be sufficient. In addition, a well-structured group can only be functional if there is a chain of command, meaning that individual members should not be operating on their own but must be subjected to the authority of their superiors, who are expected to steer the group's activities.567 A set of rules according to which a group functions implies not only written but also unwritten rules that must be observed by its members. These three criteria could possibly be met by the groups of individuals acting on behalf of states in cyberspace, but it is also the case that hackers and others using advanced cyber tools to cause harm and destruction cannot easily be distinguished from civilians, given that this distinction is certainly more blurred in the context of COs. The fourth requirement, of outward symbols of authority, is more relevant to the engagement of military and paramilitary units in armed conflicts who wear special uniforms, carry weapons and are distinguishable from civilians, and should not be regarded as the core one. This follows from the reasoning of the ICTY referring to the Stephens case, in which the Mexico-United States General Claims Commission used the overall control test despite the fact that the irregular armed group had not had uniforms and insignia.568 Logically, it is to be observed that groups carrying out COs on behalf of states can meet the identified criteria.\nIn conclusion, both the effective and overall control theories are useful instruments in determining the extent of control exercised by states in relation to cyber non-state actors and their operations and in attributing breaches of international\n565 Tadić judgment, 49, para. 120.\n566 Collin Allan, 'Attribution issues in cyberspace', Chicago-Kent Journal of International and Comparative Law 13 (2) (2013), 60.\n567 Tadić judgment, 49, para. 120.\n568 United States v.

In the light of recent technological advances, they are not solely applicable to military operations and should be resorted to in the cyber context depending on the specific circumstances of a case in which individuals and groups might be involved.\n# The Stuxnet incident\nIn relations between themselves, states have yet to invoke international responsibility for malicious cyber activities. This could be explained by many uncertainties regarding not only their general unwillingness to prevent further conflicts from escalating but also the application of international law to cyberspace and legal attribution.[569] It is, however, to be expected that a cyber dispute will be adjudicated in the (near) future on the basis of international law[570] and therefore it is reasonable to apply the above considerations to a well-documented real-life scenario and to determine whether and to what extent legal attribution of COs constituting violations of state obligations could be established.\nThe deployment of the malicious Stuxnet worm against Iran has been frequently referred to as the use of the world's first cyber weapon.[571] It has led to the realisation that COs amounting to cyber warfare are a major threat to any state around the globe and can have significant consequences: it is true that many states develop and use similar offensive cyber capabilities.[572] According to the statements by anonymous US, European and Israeli officials, the US and Israel\n569 Tsagourias and Farrell (see note 20 above), 946; Banks (see note 47 above), 1510; Jody M.

For this particular exercise, the order of elements of an internationally wrongful act—attribution and a breach of international law—can be reversed for the sake of clarity, as was done in the ICJ's Bosnian Genocide judgment.584 It could be argued that the Stuxnet operation is a cyber-attack585 constituting the use of force contrary to Article 2(4) UN Charter. This provision, having a customary international law status, prohibits threats or uses of force against territorial integrity or political independence of states or threats or uses of force inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations.586 In this respect, it is not important what type of 'cyber weapon' has been used. The ICJ has underlined in its advisory opinion that 'any use of force, regardless of the weapons employed' is covered by this treaty prohibition.587 The scale and effects of the Stuxnet operation are comparable to the scale and effects of the actual use of armed force that could severely damage or destroy the uranium enrichment facility and render its centrifuges\n581 Ibid.\n582 Samuli Haataja and Afshin Akhtar-Khavari, 'Stuxnet and international law on the use of force: an informational approach', Cambridge International Law Journal 7 (1) (2018), 99-121: 101-2; Elies van Sliedregt, 'Command responsibility and cyberattacks', Journal of Conflict and Security Law 21 (3) (2016), 505-521: 507; 'Stuxnet: rumours increase, infections spread', Network Security 2010 (10) (2010), 1-2; Bruce Schneier, 'The story behind the Stuxnet virus', Forbes (7 October 2010), available at: https://www.forbes.com/2010/10/06/iran-nuclear-computer-technology-security-stuxnet-worm.; 'Stuxnet may be the work of state-backed hackers', Network Security 2010 (9) (2010), 1-2.\n583 Joby Warrick, 'Iran's Natanz nuclear facility recovered quickly from Stuxnet cyberattack', Washington Post (15 February 2011), available at: https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/irans-natanz-nuclear-facility-recovered-quickly-from-stuxnet-cyber-attack/2011/02/15/ABUIkoQ_story.; Thomas M.

So far, however, states have not recognised this or other similar cyber incidents as a situation of war. $^{590}$\nThe examination of the possibility of attribution in this case is a rather complicated matter that is used to illustrate the scope of the problem associated with the importance of collecting sufficient evidence to prove states' involvement in COs. Although there is not enough evidence to suggest that state organs of the US and Israel were directly involved in the development and deployment of the Stuxnet worm, there are some claims that the US National Security Agency (NSA) cooperated with Israel on the Stuxnet operation.[591] There are also many markers in the code of the worm indicating the Israeli involvement,[592] and a reference to Stuxnet was reportedly made in a video about military successes of the head of the Israel Defence Forces pointing at the participation of Israeli security forces in the operation.[593] If this is indeed the case and there is more sufficient evidence backing up these claims and going beyond the available circumstantial evidence, the main conclusion will be that this CO carried out by the US and Israeli agencies falling under the definition of state organs could be attributed to the respective states under Article 4 ARSIWA. This is, however, hard to prove.\nGiven that there is also no information on possible cooperation between persons and entities exercising elements of the governmental authority of the\n588 Schmitt (see note 4 above), 330-331, para. 1; in addition, the non-material harm and 'informational violence' can be said to be the result of this CO, necessitating the adoption of a broader notion of the use of force under Article 2(4) UN Charter: Haataja and Akhtar-Khavari (see note 68 above), 115-121; Haataja (see note 2 above), 136-166.\n589 Schmitt (see note 4 above), 341, para. 6.\n590 Gary P.

There are no indications or clear evidence of any instructions or direction provided by the allegedly involved states. Nevertheless, the possibility exists that third parties were engaged in the process of developing and deploying the Stuxnet worm and that they were operating under state control. According to researchers, it does not seem probable that such complex project could have been the result of the efforts of a 'lone wolf' hacker.[594] Given the characteristics of the Stuxnet infection, it is also difficult to imagine that an unorganised group of individuals could have successfully carried out this attack, because the development of such malware requires a high level of coordination and cooperation. As elaborated on in the previous section, legal attribution in these scenarios would be possible if the involved states effectively controlled the operation in question, which is a high threshold to meet.\nConsidering Article 8 ARSIWA and bearing in mind the technically complex and innovative nature of Stuxnet, it is reasonable to assume that—rather than isolated hackers or loose bands of hackers—an organised and hierarchically structured group or various groups of this nature might have acted on behalf of the respective governments: at this point, it is certainly a speculation, albeit one with roots in the facts of other cyber-incidents and theories formulated by experts, linking the development of this malware to cybercrime/cyberattack groups.[595] Under these circumstances, overall control would be the appropriate test to determine whether the two states played a role in organising, coordinating or planning of the CO in addition to their involvement in financing, training and equipping or providing operational support to the group(s). While sufficient evidence to make sound conclusions on this matter is not at hand, a claim\n594 Patrick Fitzgerald, 'The hackers behind Stuxnet', Symantec Official Blog (21 July 2010), available at: https://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/hackers-behind-stuxnet\n595 James P.

A demonstration of the 'unity of goals, unity of ethnicity and a common ideology'596 could be an indication of this. For instance, it has been claimed that the Equation Group—a sophisticated threat actor—worked closely with the NSA as a team of developers behind the Stuxnet malware or assisted the Stuxnet developers in their efforts.597 The NSA probably not only organised, coordinated and planned the actions of this organised and highly structured group, but also paid them for the delivered work and even supplied them with certain tools, such as the advanced keylogger 'Grok' developed by the NSA.598 There are also reasons to believe that operational support had to be provided to that and other hackers' collectives given the high level of sophistication of the execution of this reportedly joint operation. If this was indeed the case and the US and Israel had overall control in the CO, while Articles 4, 5 and 11 ARSIWA were not applicable, attribution per Article 8 ARSIWA would be possible, leading to the international responsibility of both states.599 Moreover, according to Articles 16 and 17 ARSIWA, other states aiding or assisting the US and Israel in the attack or directing and controlling them would also face responsibility if they were aware of the circumstances of the internationally wrongful act, and the attack could be qualified as such act if conducted by them.600\nSimilarly to the imputation on the basis of overall control exercised by the involved states in the Stuxnet case, the attribution of COs that could be categorised as violations of international law in other scenarios—with regard to the prohibition of not only the use of force but also intervention and the principle of sovereignty—will be possible if there is no indication of effective state control. For instance, the global WannaCry 2.0 malware attack from May 2017 was publicly attributed to North Korea by a number of states, including the US and the UK,\n596 Dissenting opinion of Al-Khasawneh, Bosnian Genocide judgment, 216, para. 36.\n597 Thomas Brewster, 'Equation = NSA?

Legally proving the exercise of effective control in this particular scenario would be exceedingly difficult, if not impossible: it cannot be proved that the state in question effectively controlled the CO and was able to continuously decide how and when the related activities of the hackers should be carried out, closely monitor the execution of the operation and order its cessation at any given point in time. Although an extensive investigation into the factual circumstances of WannaCry 2.0 by the competent authorities and experts and a high level of transparency on the matter are certainly needed, it can be maintained that the abovementioned hackers' collective receives financial and other support from the North Korean government, which also organises, coordinates or plans COs together with the members of this group, which are carried out on its behalf.\nLikewise, the SolarWinds hack that had targeted various governmental institutions and private organisations in the US and was revealed in December 2020 cannot be legally imputed to the Russian Federation under Articles 4, 5 and 11 ARSIWA, despite the fact that the attack has been attributed to the Russian foreign intelligence service at the political level.⁶⁰³ This is the case due to the lack of credible evidence indicating that this particular CO was directly conducted by the actors specified in Articles 4 and 5 ARSIWA and the unwillingness of Moscow to consider this unlawful conduct its own. On the one hand, this CO, time and again, illustrates the complexity of imputation based on the effective control test of Article 8 ARSIWA, even if it can be established that the Russian hackers' group Cozy Bear or Nobelium affiliated with the abovementioned foreign intelligence\n⁶⁰¹ Paul Sandle, 'Britain joins U.S. in blaming North Korea for \"WannaCry\" attack', Reuters (19 December 2017), available at: https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-cyber-northkorea-britain-idUSKBN1ED1SK\n⁶⁰² Olivia Solon, 'WannaCry ransomware has links to North Korea, cybersecurity experts say', The Guardian (15 May 2017), available at: https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/may/15/wannacry-ransomware-north-korea-lazarus-group\n⁶⁰³ Danny Palmer, 'SolarWinds: US and UK blame Russian intelligence service hackers for major cyberattack', ZDNet (15 April 2021), available at: https://www.zdnet.com/article/solarwinds-us-and-uk-blame-russian-intelligence-service-hackers-for-major-cyber-attack/\nCHAPTER 11 | Pulling the strings in cyberspace\n217\nservice was reportedly behind the operation.⁶⁰⁴ On the other hand, the overall control theory offers a helpful instrument for linking this and similar operations conducted by organised and well-structured groups of individuals in the digital domain to states, if those powerful ‘puppeteers’ play a role in organising, coordinating or planning the activities of their skilful ‘puppets’, while also providing financial and other forms of support to them.\n# Conclusion\nAs explained above, there are still various pertinent issues that can be identified in the process of legally attributing COs to states under the existing control theories. The analysis of the case study of Stuxnet indicates that there is an obvious problem of evidence or—to be more precise—the lack thereof that needs to be solved in the process of technical attribution. Only then would legal experts be able to assign international responsibility to states for malicious cyber-activities. The examination has revealed, in a rather speculative manner, that the Stuxnet operation could be attributed to the US and Israel on the basis of Article 4 ARSIWA if their state organs had conducted it or on the basis of Article 8 ARSIWA and the overall control test if organised and hierarchically structured (hackers’) groups had been involved in the development and deployment of the worm.\nA few policy recommendations can be made following the analysis performed. The law of international responsibility should not fade into oblivion, but it is essential to develop it further in conformity with legal and technological developments shaping our physical and digital worlds. Given the rapid proliferation of cyber warfare capabilities, the reliance of states on various non-state groups—even those specialising in cyber terrorism⁶⁰⁵—for carrying out COs and issues associated with establishing a high degree of state control in cyberspace, the overall control theory must receive more judicial and political attention. Its requirements should be updated in accordance with the current practice of state involvement in COs, the criterion of outward authority symbols can be abolished\n⁶⁰⁴ Alyza Sebenius, ‘U.S., U.K. reveal code flaws abused by SolarWinds hackers’, Bloomberg (7 May 2021), available at: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-07/u-s-and-u-k-release-details-on-russia-s-solarwinds-hackers\n⁶⁰⁵ Thomas M.

As argued by some authors, there could be merit in developing and introducing new theories, such as 'soft control'⁶⁰⁶ or 'working in tandem'⁶⁰⁷ tests, although the overall control concept grounded in customary international law seems to be the more appropriate choice. Furthermore, evidence-related questions must be answered and there is perhaps a need for creating international/regional attribution mechanisms⁶⁰⁸ based on cooperation between states and other organisations and persons with relevant expertise, including those from academia,⁶⁰⁹ that are capable of striking a delicate balance between the secretive nature of attribution and its transparency. More transparency about national attribution efforts is in any case a welcome development that could contribute to further crystallisation of customary international law in this field.⁶¹⁰ Finally, other possibilities for holding states responsible, such as cyber due diligence,⁶¹¹ should be explored in order to prevent international law from being violated through the omnipresent yet distant fifth domain.\n606 Tsagourias and Farrell (see note 21 above), 965.\n607 Allan (see note 52 above), 81.\n608 Tsagourias and Farrell (see note 21 above), 959–961.\n609 Florian J.

The institution of responsibility is at the heart of international law and is part of the constitution of the international community. This being said, cyberspace poses numerous challenges to international law's central objective of ensuring responsibility.'515\nRussell Buchan and Nicholas Tsagourias, 'Special Issue: Non-State Actors and Responsibility in Cyberspace: State Responsibility, Individual Criminal Responsibility and Issues of Evidence', Journal of Conflict &amp; Security Law 21 (3) (2016), 371-381: 377.\nCHAPTER 11 | Pulling the strings in cyberspace\n# Introduction\nNowadays, both state and non-state actors have various technical tools at their disposal that can be used in theory, and are used in practice, to conduct operations in cyberspace with the aim of harming interests of other states and inter alia causing damage to their infrastructures.[516] These so-called 'cyber operations' (COs) are a notion that has a broader scope than the terms 'cyber warfare'[517] or 'cyber war' often used in the literature. This notion is used throughout the Tallinn Manual 2.0 that has been drafted by a group of highly qualified legal experts and clarifies how international law applies to cyberspace.[518] COs are carried out not only in the context of armed conflicts but also in times of peace, and fall under different legal regimes, including humanitarian and human rights law.[519] They are defined as operations that involve the employment of capabilities aimed at achieving certain objectives in or through cyberspace.[520] 'Cyberspace' can be understood as both the physical and non-physical domain consisting in part or in whole of some essential components such as computer systems, communications networks, software, digital information including content and traffic data, and persons and entities using these data.[521]\nA series of distributed denial-of-service attacks were carried out in January 2022 by hackers allegedly affiliated with the Russian government against Ukraine.[522] In April 2022—15 years after the digital attacks[523] on Estonia that,\n\nResponsible behaviour in cyberspace | Global narratives and practice\namong other things, led to the adoption of the abovementioned manual—it was revealed that the hackers' group Sandstorm (often linked to the Russian military intelligence agency) launched a cyber-attack on Ukrainian energy facilities but had been prevented from causing damage.524 This and similar COs are in certain instances perceived as the use of force, which is prohibited under international law, while in other scenarios they fall below this threshold and land in a grey, unexplored zone between war and peace. Importantly, the practice of launching cyber-attacks reveals that states operating in the international arena may use proxies and violate international law without facing responsibility for malicious cyber actors' activities, while at the same time achieving their strategic objectives and advancing their interests.525 In other words, states are capable of acting as 'puppeteers', hiding behind their 'puppets' in the dark of cyberspace and escaping any form of responsibility.526\nThe current contribution investigates the issue of state responsibility for the involvement of states in COs by approaching this subject from the angle of legal attribution. More particularly, it explores the level of state control that is required for attributing operations of private actors posing cyber threats,[527] such as individual hackers and hackers' groups, to states exercising control over them. This study proposes to take into account customary international law that does not prescribe a specific test for examining the degree of state control in the physical world or in cyberspace in every single instance of determining whether an internationally wrongful act has been committed. It argues that there is a need to reconsider the application of the existing control theories in the light of the current realities in order to assess the possibility of legal attribution and assigning responsibility to states exercising varying degrees of control. In addition, it uses the proposed approach for determining the level of state control by applying it to the facts of the case study on the infamous Stuxnet attack involving state actors, which could be seen as a violation of international law.\nThe next section of this chapter gives a brief overview of the doctrine of state responsibility in relation to COs and touches on a number of attribution modes.\n\nCHAPTER 11 | Pulling the strings in cyberspace\nThe section following it deals with the control theories that have been articulated by two international judicial bodies: the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY). In addition, it explains how the question of control should be approached by using the two abovementioned control tests. Then, the findings of the previous sections are used to shed light on the issue of attribution in the case study conducted on Stuxnet. The final section provides a conclusion.\n# State responsibility\nFirst and foremost, cyberspace does not exist in a legal vacuum and international law regulates activities taking place in this 'fifth domain' of warfare existing alongside the domains of sea, land, air and space.528 This means that secondary rules of international law—the law of state responsibility—find application in operations originating in cyberspace, in addition to primary rules of numerous treaties and customary international law.529 International responsibility rules and principles had been laid down in the (Draft) Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (ARSIWA) by the International Law Commission, and the UN General Assembly took note of this important document in its resolution.530 The commission of such acts by states triggers their international responsibility, as indicated by the basic principle of Article 1 ARSIWA, which has been widely applied by international judicial bodies. As a result, new legal relationships between states arise under international law and bring about certain legal consequences, such as an obligation of making reparations for the damage incurred. An internationally wrongful act of a state has been committed if conduct is attributable to the state in question under international law and constitutes a breach of an international obligation of that state, according to\n\nResponsible behaviour in cyberspace | Global narratives and practice\nArticle 2 ARSIWA. On the one hand, attribution—the subjective element—means that an action or omission of an individual or a group of individuals through whom states act must be attached to a state as a subject of international law, so that it is perceived as a state act.[531] On the other hand, a breach as the objective element entails a violation of international law consisting of not only treaty but also non-treaty state obligations in which a state engages, such as using force contrary to Article 2(4) UN Charter.[532]\nAttribution is a multi-layered process including different dimensions.[533] Firstly, there is technical attribution that is far from unproblematic due to inter alia the use of botnets and IP spoofing and is concerned with identifying the actual perpetrators of COs by using a variety of technical tools and techniques in the context of forensic investigations.[534] Secondly, political attribution deals with connecting harmful activities in the cyber domain to states or entities associated with them. It is performed at the political level, where political consequences of COs and possible retaliation play the core role.[535] Political attribution does not by definition carry the intention of holding other states responsible.[536] This is what legal attribution is used for: assigning international responsibility to states that are to a certain degree involved in COs.[537] It is obvious that the process of legally attributing malicious cyber activities to states is dependent on the output of technical attribution in the form of forensic evidence needed for establishing who the involved states and non-state actors are and what their specific relationships are. Legal attribution is also closely linked to public attribution and both may form part of states' attribution efforts, having not only technical and operational but also strategic levels and resulting in communication to the public, politicians and others.[538] In general, states cannot be held responsible for the conduct of\nUNGA, Report of the International Law Commission – Fifty-Third Session, 35, paras 4–6.\nIbid., paras 7-8.\nNicholas Tsagourias, 'Cyber attacks, self-defence and the problem of attribution', Journal of Conflict and Security Law 17 (2) (2012), 229-244: 233.\nHeather Harrison Dinniss, Cyber Warfare and the Laws of War (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2012), 99-102; Nicholas Tsagourias and Michael Farrell, 'Cyber attribution: technical and legal approaches and challenges', European Journal of International Law 31 (3) (2020), 941-976: 942; Marco Roscini, Cyber Operations and the Use of Force in International Law (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2014), 33; Jack Goldsmith, 'How cyber changes the laws of war', European Journal of International Law 24 (1) (2013), 129-138: 135; Tsagourias (see note 19 above), 233.\nJon R.

Legal attribution or imputation in the law of state responsibility is in essence 'the operation of attaching a given action or omission to a State'.[539]\nThere are four modes of legal attribution derived from customary international law that are of utmost importance to the engagement of states in COs. The first attribution mode, found in Article 4 ARSIWA, concerns the conduct of state organs, such as the armed forces, constituting state acts on the basis of international law.[540] In this regard, functions exercised by state organs are irrelevant, similarly to their positions within the state machinery.[541] What is of relevance is that the status of a state organ must be conferred on a person or an entity by the national law of that state. The second attribution modality is Article 5 ARSIWA, dealing with the conduct of persons or entities that are empowered by the domestic law of a state to exercise elements of the governmental authority and actually act in that capacity. If semi-public entities, private companies and others are involved in COs, are tasked by the internal law of a state with carrying out governmental functions and act in breach of international obligations of that state, the latter can be held responsible.[542] The third applicable type of attribution is Article 11 ARSIWA, dealing with situations when non-state actors' actions or omissions are acknowledged and adopted by a state as its own.[543] This should not be a sole support of such conduct but a state is required to consider it as its own and, for instance, take steps to ensure that the conduct does not stop.[544] Clearly, in practice states would rarely go as far as to use their official organs and individuals or entities exercising governmental authority to directly conduct COs violating international law or to acknowledge and adopt such operations as their own. If they do, however, the attribution grounds presented in Articles 4, 5 and 11 ARSIWA will be expected to be applicable and the application of these\n\nResponsible behaviour in cyberspace | Global narratives and practice\nprovisions in cyberspace will be less problematic than the final and most significant mode of attribution laid down in Article 8 ARSIWA.545 It is about the conduct of non-state actors operating on instructions of states or under their direction and control.546 In the case of instructions, intentions of a state must be manifestly indicated with respect to international law violations that are authorised by it.547 With respect to direction, the commission of those violations must be directed by a state providing instructions to non-state actors in a constant manner.548 It is difficult to prove that instructions have been given or that direction has taken place.549 State control appears to be a more practically relevant manner of legally attributing private conduct under Article 8 ARSIWA, which at the same time also poses a number of legal problems, to be tackled below.\n# Control theories in the age of cyber\nDelving into the question of state control exercised over COs and actors participating in them as the most valuable type of legal attribution outlined in Article 8 ARSIWA requires elaboration of two control theories: the effective control test put forward by the ICJ and the ICTY's overall control test. Both theories are discussed in the context of state responsibility in the original Tallinn Manual, but the 2.0 version mentions only the ICJ's perspective and its approach as seemingly the leading theory for attribution on the basis of control without much further explanation.[550]\nIn its judgment in the Nicaragua case, the ICJ held that the conduct of contras would trigger international responsibility of the US if it was proved that the state had effectively controlled the military or paramilitary operations during which\n\nCHAPTER 11 | Pulling the strings in cyberspace\ninternational law violations had taken place. Involvement of the state in the form of financing, equipping or providing training to the contras, participation in the operational planning and general state control would not be sufficient to conclude that the perpetration of acts contrary to international law was directed or enforced by that state. The ‘effective control’ test has a significantly high threshold and is hard to satisfy in practice: it requires a state to effectively determine how COs breaching its international law obligations are to be conducted and to monitor their execution on a continuous basis. In the judgment in the Bosnian Genocide case, the ICJ stated that the effective control theory is the one to be followed for the purposes of Article 8 ARSIWA rather than the easier to meet ‘overall control’ test enunciated by the ICTY in the Tadić decision. Although the discussion might seem to have ended there, much can be said about the necessity for applying a control theory with a lower threshold that would not allow states to escape international responsibility by using non-state actors controlled by them.\nIt follows from the reasoning of the ICTY’s Appeals Chamber that the required level of state control over individuals and groups of individuals is different in nature: this idea was supported by the vice-president of the ICJ, Awn Shawkat Al-Khasawneh, in the Bosnian Genocide case, who drew attention to the fact that ‘the test of control is a variable one’. In this regard, two factual scenarios should be distinguished in cyberspace: (1) private individuals or unorganised groups of individuals conducting COs and engaging in violations of international law on behalf of states; (2) organised and hierarchically structured groups of individuals committing those violations. The first situation would require the degree of state control over COs to be effective in order to make legal attribution possible. For the second scenario, state control of an overall character over\n Case Concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v.

An argument can be made that synchronously with numerous technological developments taking place nowadays, the law of international responsibility, including attribution rules, which is based in customary international law, is constantly evolving and should not be considered static. The adoption of more flexible attribution standards can, for instance, be observed in the area of anti-terrorism.562\nBy acknowledging the widespread reliance of states on ICT and rethinking the existing international law rules and principles, the focus must be put back on the overall control theory. This control test is supported by state and judicial practice,563 has a lower threshold564 than the effective control theory and can be useful in establishing the actual close relationship between states and organised and hierarchically structured groups acting in cyberspace. Such groups must,\n\nCHAPTER 11 | Pulling the strings in cyberspace\n\nA structure that a group has does not need to be of military nature. Arguably, a degree of organisation making group members understand their position and function within a group would be sufficient. In addition, a well-structured group can only be functional if there is a chain of command, meaning that individual members should not be operating on their own but must be subjected to the authority of their superiors, who are expected to steer the group's activities.567 A set of rules according to which a group functions implies not only written but also unwritten rules that must be observed by its members. These three criteria could possibly be met by the groups of individuals acting on behalf of states in cyberspace, but it is also the case that hackers and others using advanced cyber tools to cause harm and destruction cannot easily be distinguished from civilians, given that this distinction is certainly more blurred in the context of COs. The fourth requirement, of outward symbols of authority, is more relevant to the engagement of military and paramilitary units in armed conflicts who wear special uniforms, carry weapons and are distinguishable from civilians, and should not be regarded as the core one. This follows from the reasoning of the ICTY referring to the Stephens case, in which the Mexico-United States General Claims Commission used the overall control test despite the fact that the irregular armed group had not had uniforms and insignia.568 Logically, it is to be observed that groups carrying out COs on behalf of states can meet the identified criteria.\nIn conclusion, both the effective and overall control theories are useful instruments in determining the extent of control exercised by states in relation to cyber non-state actors and their operations and in attributing breaches of international\n\nResponsible behaviour in cyberspace | Global narratives and practice\nlaw to those states on the basis of Article 8 ARSIWA. In the light of recent technological advances, they are not solely applicable to military operations and should be resorted to in the cyber context depending on the specific circumstances of a case in which individuals and groups might be involved.\n# The Stuxnet incident\nIn relations between themselves, states have yet to invoke international responsibility for malicious cyber activities. This could be explained by many uncertainties regarding not only their general unwillingness to prevent further conflicts from escalating but also the application of international law to cyberspace and legal attribution.[569] It is, however, to be expected that a cyber dispute will be adjudicated in the (near) future on the basis of international law[570] and therefore it is reasonable to apply the above considerations to a well-documented real-life scenario and to determine whether and to what extent legal attribution of COs constituting violations of state obligations could be established.\nThe deployment of the malicious Stuxnet worm against Iran has been frequently referred to as the use of the world's first cyber weapon.[571] It has led to the realisation that COs amounting to cyber warfare are a major threat to any state around the globe and can have significant consequences: it is true that many states develop and use similar offensive cyber capabilities.[572] According to the statements by anonymous US, European and Israeli officials, the US and Israel\n\nCHAPTER 11 | Pulling the strings in cyberspace\nwere jointly involved in the Stuxnet operation. $^{573}$  With an aim of sabotaging the Iranian uranium enrichment programme, a covert project code-named 'Olympic Games' was authorised by the Bush administration and further advanced during the Obama administration. $^{574}$  Israel also made preparations for this covert action against Iran and, reportedly, carried out a number of tests before the actual deployment of Stuxnet. $^{575}$\nIn June 2009, the computer worm of around 500 KB (packed with Ultimate Packer for eXecutables (UPX)) and approximately 1.2 MB (unpacked))[576] had infiltrated the computer systems located at the Natanz nuclear enrichment plant via a USB stick and spread via local area networks.[577] Described as 'an unprecedentedly masterful and malicious piece of code', Stuxnet operated in three phases: (1) attacking machines running Microsoft Windows and replicating itself through computer networks; (2) looking for Siemens Step7 software required for programming industrial control systems; and (3) opening access to the programmable logic controllers, allowing the attackers to damage a significant part of the industrial machinery by altering the rotation speed of the centrifuges.[578] As a computer worm of high sophistication, Stuxnet had exploited four Windows zero-day vulnerabilities in a fascinating manner and was able to effectively intervene in the functioning of the centrifuges without revealing itself until it was discovered in June 2010 by a small IT security company from Belarus.[579]\nIt appears that the development and deployment of the Stuxnet worm were certainly not an amateur work of 'a ragtag group of black-hat hackers'.[580] It was an effort possibly undertaken by a large group of skilled professionals who had a\n\nResponsible behaviour in cyberspace | Global narratives and practice\nspecific aim of targeting the nuclear facilities of Iran: 10 people would need approximately two or three years to create it.581 Due to the complex architecture of the worm, its clear destructive intent directed towards the Iranian nuclear plants and its development costs, many experts tend to believe that it could not have been done without involvement of a government.582 While it is not known who exactly initiated the Stuxnet infection, the US and Israeli governments are often claimed to be behind this attack.583 The question is, however: what was the degree of their involvement?\nBefore looking into the question of attribution, one should establish whether an internationally wrongful act has been committed in the Stuxnet incident. For this particular exercise, the order of elements of an internationally wrongful act—attribution and a breach of international law—can be reversed for the sake of clarity, as was done in the ICJ's Bosnian Genocide judgment.584 It could be argued that the Stuxnet operation is a cyber-attack585 constituting the use of force contrary to Article 2(4) UN Charter. This provision, having a customary international law status, prohibits threats or uses of force against territorial integrity or political independence of states or threats or uses of force inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations.586 In this respect, it is not important what type of 'cyber weapon' has been used. The ICJ has underlined in its advisory opinion that 'any use of force, regardless of the weapons employed' is covered by this treaty prohibition.587 The scale and effects of the Stuxnet operation are comparable to the scale and effects of the actual use of armed force that could severely damage or destroy the uranium enrichment facility and render its centrifuges\n\nCHAPTER 11 | Pulling the strings in cyberspace\ninoperative. $^{588}$  It could even be considered an armed attack justifying the exercise of the inherent right of states to self-defence in accordance with Article 51 UN Charter, as some Tallinn Manual 2.0 experts have also indicated. $^{589}$  If the Stuxnet attack was carried out by private actors and is attributed to certain states, these states would be considered to have acted in violation of the use of force prohibition. So far, however, states have not recognised this or other similar cyber incidents as a situation of war. $^{590}$\nThe examination of the possibility of attribution in this case is a rather complicated matter that is used to illustrate the scope of the problem associated with the importance of collecting sufficient evidence to prove states' involvement in COs. Although there is not enough evidence to suggest that state organs of the US and Israel were directly involved in the development and deployment of the Stuxnet worm, there are some claims that the US National Security Agency (NSA) cooperated with Israel on the Stuxnet operation.[591] There are also many markers in the code of the worm indicating the Israeli involvement,[592] and a reference to Stuxnet was reportedly made in a video about military successes of the head of the Israel Defence Forces pointing at the participation of Israeli security forces in the operation.[593] If this is indeed the case and there is more sufficient evidence backing up these claims and going beyond the available circumstantial evidence, the main conclusion will be that this CO carried out by the US and Israeli agencies falling under the definition of state organs could be attributed to the respective states under Article 4 ARSIWA. This is, however, hard to prove.\nGiven that there is also no information on possible cooperation between persons and entities exercising elements of the governmental authority of the\n\nResponsible behaviour in cyberspace | Global narratives and practice\nUS and Israel in the Stuxnet operation and the participation in it has not been acknowledged or specifically approved by any state, as required by Articles 5 and 11 ARSIWA respectively, particular attention should be devoted to Article 8 ARSIWA and it is to be established whether certain individuals or groups were acting on instructions, under direction or control of these states. There are no indications or clear evidence of any instructions or direction provided by the allegedly involved states. Nevertheless, the possibility exists that third parties were engaged in the process of developing and deploying the Stuxnet worm and that they were operating under state control. According to researchers, it does not seem probable that such complex project could have been the result of the efforts of a 'lone wolf' hacker.[594] Given the characteristics of the Stuxnet infection, it is also difficult to imagine that an unorganised group of individuals could have successfully carried out this attack, because the development of such malware requires a high level of coordination and cooperation. As elaborated on in the previous section, legal attribution in these scenarios would be possible if the involved states effectively controlled the operation in question, which is a high threshold to meet.\nConsidering Article 8 ARSIWA and bearing in mind the technically complex and innovative nature of Stuxnet, it is reasonable to assume that—rather than isolated hackers or loose bands of hackers—an organised and hierarchically structured group or various groups of this nature might have acted on behalf of the respective governments: at this point, it is certainly a speculation, albeit one with roots in the facts of other cyber-incidents and theories formulated by experts, linking the development of this malware to cybercrime/cyberattack groups.[595] Under these circumstances, overall control would be the appropriate test to determine whether the two states played a role in organising, coordinating or planning of the CO in addition to their involvement in financing, training and equipping or providing operational support to the group(s). While sufficient evidence to make sound conclusions on this matter is not at hand, a claim\n\nCHAPTER 11 | Pulling the strings in cyberspace\ncould be advanced that the US and Israel organised, coordinated and planned the Stuxnet worm attack and also financed and possibly equipped the hired hackers. A demonstration of the 'unity of goals, unity of ethnicity and a common ideology'596 could be an indication of this. For instance, it has been claimed that the Equation Group—a sophisticated threat actor—worked closely with the NSA as a team of developers behind the Stuxnet malware or assisted the Stuxnet developers in their efforts.597 The NSA probably not only organised, coordinated and planned the actions of this organised and highly structured group, but also paid them for the delivered work and even supplied them with certain tools, such as the advanced keylogger 'Grok' developed by the NSA.598 There are also reasons to believe that operational support had to be provided to that and other hackers' collectives given the high level of sophistication of the execution of this reportedly joint operation. If this was indeed the case and the US and Israel had overall control in the CO, while Articles 4, 5 and 11 ARSIWA were not applicable, attribution per Article 8 ARSIWA would be possible, leading to the international responsibility of both states.599 Moreover, according to Articles 16 and 17 ARSIWA, other states aiding or assisting the US and Israel in the attack or directing and controlling them would also face responsibility if they were aware of the circumstances of the internationally wrongful act, and the attack could be qualified as such act if conducted by them.600\nSimilarly to the imputation on the basis of overall control exercised by the involved states in the Stuxnet case, the attribution of COs that could be categorised as violations of international law in other scenarios—with regard to the prohibition of not only the use of force but also intervention and the principle of sovereignty—will be possible if there is no indication of effective state control. For instance, the global WannaCry 2.0 malware attack from May 2017 was publicly attributed to North Korea by a number of states, including the US and the UK,\n\nResponsible behaviour in cyberspace | Global narratives and practice\nseveral months after its discovery. It has been claimed that the Lazarus Group as a hacking team allegedly sponsored by the North Korean government conducted this attack targeting public and private organisations worldwide. There is no evidence of official state organs of North Korea or persons and entities of that state exercising governmental authority having accomplished this CO unaccompanied by others, and it is obvious that Pyongyang would not acknowledge and adopt this malware operation as its own. Legally proving the exercise of effective control in this particular scenario would be exceedingly difficult, if not impossible: it cannot be proved that the state in question effectively controlled the CO and was able to continuously decide how and when the related activities of the hackers should be carried out, closely monitor the execution of the operation and order its cessation at any given point in time. Although an extensive investigation into the factual circumstances of WannaCry 2.0 by the competent authorities and experts and a high level of transparency on the matter are certainly needed, it can be maintained that the abovementioned hackers' collective receives financial and other support from the North Korean government, which also organises, coordinates or plans COs together with the members of this group, which are carried out on its behalf.\nLikewise, the SolarWinds hack that had targeted various governmental institutions and private organisations in the US and was revealed in December 2020 cannot be legally imputed to the Russian Federation under Articles 4, 5 and 11 ARSIWA, despite the fact that the attack has been attributed to the Russian foreign intelligence service at the political level. This is the case due to the lack of credible evidence indicating that this particular CO was directly conducted by the actors specified in Articles 4 and 5 ARSIWA and the unwillingness of Moscow to consider this unlawful conduct its own. On the one hand, this CO, time and again, illustrates the complexity of imputation based on the effective control test of Article 8 ARSIWA, even if it can be established that the Russian hackers' group Cozy Bear or Nobelium affiliated with the abovementioned foreign intelligence\n Paul Sandle, 'Britain joins U.S. in blaming North Korea for \"WannaCry\" attack', Reuters (19 December 2017), available at: https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-cyber-northkorea-britain-idUSKBN1ED1SK\n Olivia Solon, 'WannaCry ransomware has links to North Korea, cybersecurity experts say', The Guardian (15 May 2017), available at: https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/may/15/wannacry-ransomware-north-korea-lazarus-group\n Danny Palmer, 'SolarWinds: US and UK blame Russian intelligence service hackers for major cyberattack', ZDNet (15 April 2021), available at: https://www.zdnet.com/article/solarwinds-us-and-uk-blame-russian-intelligence-service-hackers-for-major-cyber-attack/\nCHAPTER 11 | Pulling the strings in cyberspace\n\n# Conclusion\nAs explained above, there are still various pertinent issues that can be identified in the process of legally attributing COs to states under the existing control theories. The analysis of the case study of Stuxnet indicates that there is an obvious problem of evidence or—to be more precise—the lack thereof that needs to be solved in the process of technical attribution. Only then would legal experts be able to assign international responsibility to states for malicious cyber-activities. The examination has revealed, in a rather speculative manner, that the Stuxnet operation could be attributed to the US and Israel on the basis of Article 4 ARSIWA if their state organs had conducted it or on the basis of Article 8 ARSIWA and the overall control test if organised and hierarchically structured (hackers’) groups had been involved in the development and deployment of the worm.\nA few policy recommendations can be made following the analysis performed. The law of international responsibility should not fade into oblivion, but it is essential to develop it further in conformity with legal and technological developments shaping our physical and digital worlds. Given the rapid proliferation of cyber warfare capabilities, the reliance of states on various non-state groups—even those specialising in cyber terrorism—for carrying out COs and issues associated with establishing a high degree of state control in cyberspace, the overall control theory must receive more judicial and political attention. Its requirements should be updated in accordance with the current practice of state involvement in COs, the criterion of outward authority symbols can be abolished\n Alyza Sebenius, ‘U.S., U.K. reveal code flaws abused by SolarWinds hackers’, Bloomberg (7 May 2021), available at: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-07/u-s-and-u-k-release-details-on-russia-s-solarwinds-hackers\n Thomas M.

As argued by some authors, there could be merit in developing and introducing new theories, such as 'soft control' or 'working in tandem' tests, although the overall control concept grounded in customary international law seems to be the more appropriate choice. Furthermore, evidence-related questions must be answered and there is perhaps a need for creating international/regional attribution mechanisms based on cooperation between states and other organisations and persons with relevant expertise, including those from academia, that are capable of striking a delicate balance between the secretive nature of attribution and its transparency. More transparency about national attribution efforts is in any case a welcome development that could contribute to further crystallisation of customary international law in this field. Finally, other possibilities for holding states responsible, such as cyber due diligence, should be explored in order to prevent international law from being violated through the omnipresent yet distant fifth domain.",

The institution of responsibility is at the heart of international law and is part of the constitution of the international community. This being said, cyberspace poses numerous challenges to international law's central objective of ensuring responsibility.'515 Russell Buchan and Nicholas Tsagourias, 'Special Issue: Non-State Actors and Responsibility in Cyberspace: State Responsibility, Individual Criminal Responsibility and Issues of Evidence', Journal of Conflict &amp; Security Law 21 (3) (2016), 371-381: 377.\nCHAPTER 11 | Pulling the strings in cyberspace # Introduction Nowadays, both state and non-state actors have various technical tools at their disposal that can be used in theory, and are used in practice, to conduct operations in cyberspace with the aim of harming interests of other states and inter alia causing damage to their infrastructures.[516] These so-called 'cyber operations' (COs) are a notion that has a broader scope than the terms 'cyber warfare'[517] or 'cyber war' often used in the literature. This notion is used throughout the Tallinn Manual 2.0 that has been drafted by a group of highly qualified legal experts and clarifies how international law applies to cyberspace.[518] COs are carried out not only in the context of armed conflicts but also in times of peace, and fall under different legal regimes, including humanitarian and human rights law.[519] They are defined as operations that involve the employment of capabilities aimed at achieving certain objectives in or through cyberspace.[520] 'Cyberspace' can be understood as both the physical and non-physical domain consisting in part or in whole of some essential components such as computer systems, communications networks, software, digital information including content and traffic data, and persons and entities using these data.[521] A series of distributed denial-of-service attacks were carried out in January 2022 by hackers allegedly affiliated with the Russian government against Ukraine.[522] In April 2022—15 years after the digital attacks[523] on Estonia that, Responsible behaviour in cyberspace | Global narratives and practice among other things, led to the adoption of the abovementioned manual—it was revealed that the hackers' group Sandstorm (often linked to the Russian military intelligence agency) launched a cyber-attack on Ukrainian energy facilities but had been prevented from causing damage.524 This and similar COs are in certain instances perceived as the use of force, which is prohibited under international law, while in other scenarios they fall below this threshold and land in a grey, unexplored zone between war and peace. Importantly, the practice of launching cyber-attacks reveals that states operating in the international arena may use proxies and violate international law without facing responsibility for malicious cyber actors' activities, while at the same time achieving their strategic objectives and advancing their interests.525 In other words, states are capable of acting as 'puppeteers', hiding behind their 'puppets' in the dark of cyberspace and escaping any form of responsibility.526 The current contribution investigates the issue of state responsibility for the involvement of states in COs by approaching this subject from the angle of legal attribution. More particularly, it explores the level of state control that is required for attributing operations of private actors posing cyber threats,[527] such as individual hackers and hackers' groups, to states exercising control over them. This study proposes to take into account customary international law that does not prescribe a specific test for examining the degree of state control in the physical world or in cyberspace in every single instance of determining whether an internationally wrongful act has been committed. It argues that there is a need to reconsider the application of the existing control theories in the light of the current realities in order to assess the possibility of legal attribution and assigning responsibility to states exercising varying degrees of control. In addition, it uses the proposed approach for determining the level of state control by applying it to the facts of the case study on the infamous Stuxnet attack involving state actors, which could be seen as a violation of international law.\nThe next section of this chapter gives a brief overview of the doctrine of state responsibility in relation to COs and touches on a number of attribution modes.\nCHAPTER 11 | Pulling the strings in cyberspace The section following it deals with the control theories that have been articulated by two international judicial bodies: the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY). In addition, it explains how the question of control should be approached by using the two abovementioned control tests. Then, the findings of the previous sections are used to shed light on the issue of attribution in the case study conducted on Stuxnet. The final section provides a conclusion.",

Legal attribution or imputation in the law of state responsibility is in essence 'the operation of attaching a given action or omission to a State'.[539] There are four modes of legal attribution derived from customary international law that are of utmost importance to the engagement of states in COs. The first attribution mode, found in Article 4 ARSIWA, concerns the conduct of state organs, such as the armed forces, constituting state acts on the basis of international law.[540] In this regard, functions exercised by state organs are irrelevant, similarly to their positions within the state machinery.[541] What is of relevance is that the status of a state organ must be conferred on a person or an entity by the national law of that state. The second attribution modality is Article 5 ARSIWA, dealing with the conduct of persons or entities that are empowered by the domestic law of a state to exercise elements of the governmental authority and actually act in that capacity. If semi-public entities, private companies and others are involved in COs, are tasked by the internal law of a state with carrying out governmental functions and act in breach of international obligations of that state, the latter can be held responsible.[542] The third applicable type of attribution is Article 11 ARSIWA, dealing with situations when non-state actors' actions or omissions are acknowledged and adopted by a state as its own.[543] This should not be a sole support of such conduct but a state is required to consider it as its own and, for instance, take steps to ensure that the conduct does not stop.[544] Clearly, in practice states would rarely go as far as to use their official organs and individuals or entities exercising governmental authority to directly conduct COs violating international law or to acknowledge and adopt such operations as their own. If they do, however, the attribution grounds presented in Articles 4, 5 and 11 ARSIWA will be expected to be applicable and the application of these Responsible behaviour in cyberspace | Global narratives and practice provisions in cyberspace will be less problematic than the final and most significant mode of attribution laid down in Article 8 ARSIWA.545 It is about the conduct of non-state actors operating on instructions of states or under their direction and control.546 In the case of instructions, intentions of a state must be manifestly indicated with respect to international law violations that are authorised by it.547 With respect to direction, the commission of those violations must be directed by a state providing instructions to non-state actors in a constant manner.548 It is difficult to prove that instructions have been given or that direction has taken place.549 State control appears to be a more practically relevant manner of legally attributing private conduct under Article 8 ARSIWA, which at the same time also poses a number of legal problems, to be tackled below.",
    "# Control theories in the age of cyber Delving into the question of state control exercised over COs and actors participating in them as the most valuable type of legal attribution outlined in Article 8 ARSIWA requires elaboration of two control theories: the effective control test put forward by the ICJ and the ICTY's overall control test. Both theories are discussed in the context of state responsibility in the original Tallinn Manual, but the 2.0 version mentions only the ICJ's perspective and its approach as seemingly the leading theory for attribution on the basis of control without much further explanation.[550] In its judgment in the Nicaragua case, the ICJ held that the conduct of contras would trigger international responsibility of the US if it was proved that the state had effectively controlled the military or paramilitary operations during which CHAPTER 11 | Pulling the strings in cyberspace international law violations had taken place.⁵⁵¹ Involvement of the state in the form of financing, equipping or providing training to the contras, participation in the operational planning and general state control would not be sufficient to conclude that the perpetration of acts contrary to international law was directed or enforced by that state.

For the second scenario, state control of an overall character over ⁵⁵¹ Case Concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v.

An argument can be made that synchronously with numerous technological developments taking place nowadays, the law of international responsibility, including attribution rules, which is based in customary international law, is constantly evolving and should not be considered static. The adoption of more flexible attribution standards can, for instance, be observed in the area of anti-terrorism.562 By acknowledging the widespread reliance of states on ICT and rethinking the existing international law rules and principles, the focus must be put back on the overall control theory. This control test is supported by state and judicial practice,563 has a lower threshold564 than the effective control theory and can be useful in establishing the actual close relationship between states and organised and hierarchically structured groups acting in cyberspace. Such groups must, CHAPTER 11 | Pulling the strings in cyberspace A structure that a group has does not need to be of military nature. Arguably, a degree of organisation making group members understand their position and function within a group would be sufficient. In addition, a well-structured group can only be functional if there is a chain of command, meaning that individual members should not be operating on their own but must be subjected to the authority of their superiors, who are expected to steer the group's activities.567 A set of rules according to which a group functions implies not only written but also unwritten rules that must be observed by its members. These three criteria could possibly be met by the groups of individuals acting on behalf of states in cyberspace, but it is also the case that hackers and others using advanced cyber tools to cause harm and destruction cannot easily be distinguished from civilians, given that this distinction is certainly more blurred in the context of COs. The fourth requirement, of outward symbols of authority, is more relevant to the engagement of military and paramilitary units in armed conflicts who wear special uniforms, carry weapons and are distinguishable from civilians, and should not be regarded as the core one. This follows from the reasoning of the ICTY referring to the Stephens case, in which the Mexico-United States General Claims Commission used the overall control test despite the fact that the irregular armed group had not had uniforms and insignia.568 Logically, it is to be observed that groups carrying out COs on behalf of states can meet the identified criteria.\nIn conclusion, both the effective and overall control theories are useful instruments in determining the extent of control exercised by states in relation to cyber non-state actors and their operations and in attributing breaches of international Responsible behaviour in cyberspace | Global narratives and practice law to those states on the basis of Article 8 ARSIWA. In the light of recent technological advances, they are not solely applicable to military operations and should be resorted to in the cyber context depending on the specific circumstances of a case in which individuals and groups might be involved.",
    "# The Stuxnet incident In relations between themselves, states have yet to invoke international responsibility for malicious cyber activities. This could be explained by many uncertainties regarding not only their general unwillingness to prevent further conflicts from escalating but also the application of international law to cyberspace and legal attribution.[569] It is, however, to be expected that a cyber dispute will be adjudicated in the (near) future on the basis of international law[570] and therefore it is reasonable to apply the above considerations to a well-documented real-life scenario and to determine whether and to what extent legal attribution of COs constituting violations of state obligations could be established.": "The deployment of the malicious Stuxnet worm against Iran has been frequently referred to as the use of the world's first cyber weapon.[571] It has led to the realisation that COs amounting to cyber warfare are a major threat to any state around the globe and can have significant consequences: it is true that many states develop and use similar offensive cyber capabilities.[572] According to the statements by anonymous US, European and Israeli officials, the US and Israel CHAPTER 11 | Pulling the strings in cyberspace were jointly involved in the Stuxnet operation. With an aim of sabotaging the Iranian uranium enrichment programme, a covert project code-named 'Olympic Games' was authorised by the Bush administration and further advanced during the Obama administration. Israel also made preparations for this covert action against Iran and, reportedly, carried out a number of tests before the actual deployment of Stuxnet. \nIn June 2009, the computer worm of around 500 KB (packed with Ultimate Packer for eXecutables (UPX)) and approximately 1.2 MB (unpacked))[576] had infiltrated the computer systems located at the Natanz nuclear enrichment plant via a USB stick and spread via local area networks.[577] Described as 'an unprecedentedly masterful and malicious piece of code', Stuxnet operated in three phases: (1) attacking machines running Microsoft Windows and replicating itself through computer networks; (2) looking for Siemens Step7 software required for programming industrial control systems; and (3) opening access to the programmable logic controllers, allowing the attackers to damage a significant part of the industrial machinery by altering the rotation speed of the centrifuges.[578] As a computer worm of high sophistication, Stuxnet had exploited four Windows zero-day vulnerabilities in a fascinating manner and was able to effectively intervene in the functioning of the centrifuges without revealing itself until it was discovered in June 2010 by a small IT security company from Belarus.[579] It appears that the development and deployment of the Stuxnet worm were certainly not an amateur work of 'a ragtag group of black-hat hackers'.[580] It was an effort possibly undertaken by a large group of skilled professionals who had a Responsible behaviour in cyberspace | Global narratives and practice specific aim of targeting the nuclear facilities of Iran: 10 people would need approximately two or three years to create it.581 Due to the complex architecture of the worm, its clear destructive intent directed towards the Iranian nuclear plants and its development costs, many experts tend to believe that it could not have been done without involvement of a government.582 While it is not known who exactly initiated the Stuxnet infection, the US and Israeli governments are often claimed to be behind this attack.583 The question is, however: what was the degree of their involvement?\nBefore looking into the question of attribution, one should establish whether an internationally wrongful act has been committed in the Stuxnet incident. For this particular exercise, the order of elements of an internationally wrongful act—attribution and a breach of international law—can be reversed for the sake of clarity, as was done in the ICJ's Bosnian Genocide judgment.584 It could be argued that the Stuxnet operation is a cyber-attack585 constituting the use of force contrary to Article 2(4) UN Charter. This provision, having a customary international law status, prohibits threats or uses of force against territorial integrity or political independence of states or threats or uses of force inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations.586 In this respect, it is not important what type of 'cyber weapon' has been used. The ICJ has underlined in its advisory opinion that 'any use of force, regardless of the weapons employed' is covered by this treaty prohibition.587 The scale and effects of the Stuxnet operation are comparable to the scale and effects of the actual use of armed force that could severely damage or destroy the uranium enrichment facility and render its centrifuges CHAPTER 11 | Pulling the strings in cyberspace inoperative. It could even be considered an armed attack justifying the exercise of the inherent right of states to self-defence in accordance with Article 51 UN Charter, as some Tallinn Manual 2.0 experts have also indicated. If the Stuxnet attack was carried out by private actors and is attributed to certain states, these states would be considered to have acted in violation of the use of force prohibition. So far, however, states have not recognised this or other similar cyber incidents as a situation of war. \nThe examination of the possibility of attribution in this case is a rather complicated matter that is used to illustrate the scope of the problem associated with the importance of collecting sufficient evidence to prove states' involvement in COs. Although there is not enough evidence to suggest that state organs of the US and Israel were directly involved in the development and deployment of the Stuxnet worm, there are some claims that the US National Security Agency (NSA) cooperated with Israel on the Stuxnet operation.[591] There are also many markers in the code of the worm indicating the Israeli involvement,[592] and a reference to Stuxnet was reportedly made in a video about military successes of the head of the Israel Defence Forces pointing at the participation of Israeli security forces in the operation.[593] If this is indeed the case and there is more sufficient evidence backing up these claims and going beyond the available circumstantial evidence, the main conclusion will be that this CO carried out by the US and Israeli agencies falling under the definition of state organs could be attributed to the respective states under Article 4 ARSIWA. This is, however, hard to prove.\nGiven that there is also no information on possible cooperation between persons and entities exercising elements of the governmental authority of the Responsible behaviour in cyberspace | Global narratives and practice US and Israel in the Stuxnet operation and the participation in it has not been acknowledged or specifically approved by any state, as required by Articles 5 and 11 ARSIWA respectively, particular attention should be devoted to Article 8 ARSIWA and it is to be established whether certain individuals or groups were acting on instructions, under direction or control of these states. There are no indications or clear evidence of any instructions or direction provided by the allegedly involved states. Nevertheless, the possibility exists that third parties were engaged in the process of developing and deploying the Stuxnet worm and that they were operating under state control. According to researchers, it does not seem probable that such complex project could have been the result of the efforts of a 'lone wolf' hacker.[594] Given the characteristics of the Stuxnet infection, it is also difficult to imagine that an unorganised group of individuals could have successfully carried out this attack, because the development of such malware requires a high level of coordination and cooperation. As elaborated on in the previous section, legal attribution in these scenarios would be possible if the involved states effectively controlled the operation in question, which is a high threshold to meet.\nConsidering Article 8 ARSIWA and bearing in mind the technically complex and innovative nature of Stuxnet, it is reasonable to assume that—rather than isolated hackers or loose bands of hackers—an organised and hierarchically structured group or various groups of this nature might have acted on behalf of the respective governments: at this point, it is certainly a speculation, albeit one with roots in the facts of other cyber-incidents and theories formulated by experts, linking the development of this malware to cybercrime/cyberattack groups.[595] Under these circumstances, overall control would be the appropriate test to determine whether the two states played a role in organising, coordinating or planning of the CO in addition to their involvement in financing, training and equipping or providing operational support to the group(s). While sufficient evidence to make sound conclusions on this matter is not at hand, a claim CHAPTER 11 | Pulling the strings in cyberspace could be advanced that the US and Israel organised, coordinated and planned the Stuxnet worm attack and also financed and possibly equipped the hired hackers. A demonstration of the 'unity of goals, unity of ethnicity and a common ideology'596 could be an indication of this. For instance, it has been claimed that the Equation Group—a sophisticated threat actor—worked closely with the NSA as a team of developers behind the Stuxnet malware or assisted the Stuxnet developers in their efforts.597 The NSA probably not only organised, coordinated and planned the actions of this organised and highly structured group, but also paid them for the delivered work and even supplied them with certain tools, such as the advanced keylogger 'Grok' developed by the NSA.598 There are also reasons to believe that operational support had to be provided to that and other hackers' collectives given the high level of sophistication of the execution of this reportedly joint operation. If this was indeed the case and the US and Israel had overall control in the CO, while Articles 4, 5 and 11 ARSIWA were not applicable, attribution per Article 8 ARSIWA would be possible, leading to the international responsibility of both states.599 Moreover, according to Articles 16 and 17 ARSIWA, other states aiding or assisting the US and Israel in the attack or directing and controlling them would also face responsibility if they were aware of the circumstances of the internationally wrongful act, and the attack could be qualified as such act if conducted by them.600 Similarly to the imputation on the basis of overall control exercised by the involved states in the Stuxnet case, the attribution of COs that could be categorised as violations of international law in other scenarios—with regard to the prohibition of not only the use of force but also intervention and the principle of sovereignty—will be possible if there is no indication of effective state control. For instance, the global WannaCry 2.0 malware attack from May 2017 was publicly attributed to North Korea by a number of states, including the US and the UK, Responsible behaviour in cyberspace | Global narratives and practice several months after its discovery.⁶⁰¹ It has been claimed that the Lazarus Group as a hacking team allegedly sponsored by the North Korean government conducted this attack targeting public and private organisations worldwide.⁶⁰² There is no evidence of official state organs of North Korea or persons and entities of that state exercising governmental authority having accomplished this CO unaccompanied by others, and it is obvious that Pyongyang would not acknowledge and adopt this malware operation as its own. Legally proving the exercise of effective control in this particular scenario would be exceedingly difficult, if not impossible: it cannot be proved that the state in question effectively controlled the CO and was able to continuously decide how and when the related activities of the hackers should be carried out, closely monitor the execution of the operation and order its cessation at any given point in time. Although an extensive investigation into the factual circumstances of WannaCry 2.0 by the competent authorities and experts and a high level of transparency on the matter are certainly needed, it can be maintained that the abovementioned hackers' collective receives financial and other support from the North Korean government, which also organises, coordinates or plans COs together with the members of this group, which are carried out on its behalf.\nLikewise, the SolarWinds hack that had targeted various governmental institutions and private organisations in the US and was revealed in December 2020 cannot be legally imputed to the Russian Federation under Articles 4, 5 and 11 ARSIWA, despite the fact that the attack has been attributed to the Russian foreign intelligence service at the political level.⁶⁰³ This is the case due to the lack of credible evidence indicating that this particular CO was directly conducted by the actors specified in Articles 4 and 5 ARSIWA and the unwillingness of Moscow to consider this unlawful conduct its own. On the one hand, this CO, time and again, illustrates the complexity of imputation based on the effective control test of Article 8 ARSIWA, even if it can be established that the Russian hackers' group Cozy Bear or Nobelium affiliated with the abovementioned foreign intelligence ⁶⁰¹ Paul Sandle, 'Britain joins U.S. in blaming North Korea for\"WannaCry\"attack', Reuters (19 December 2017), available at: https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-cyber-northkorea-britain-idUSKBN1ED1SK ⁶⁰² Olivia Solon, 'WannaCry ransomware has links to North Korea, cybersecurity experts say', The Guardian (15 May 2017), available at: https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/may/15/wannacry-ransomware-north-korea-lazarus-group ⁶⁰³ Danny Palmer, 'SolarWinds: US and UK blame Russian intelligence service hackers for major cyberattack', ZDNet (15 April 2021), available at: https://www.zdnet.com/article/solarwinds-us-and-uk-blame-russian-intelligence-service-hackers-for-major-cyber-attack/ CHAPTER 11 | Pulling the strings in cyberspace",
    "# Conclusion": "As explained above, there are still various pertinent issues that can be identified in the process of legally attributing COs to states under the existing control theories. The analysis of the case study of Stuxnet indicates that there is an obvious problem of evidence or—to be more precise—the lack thereof that needs to be solved in the process of technical attribution. Only then would legal experts be able to assign international responsibility to states for malicious cyber-activities. The examination has revealed, in a rather speculative manner, that the Stuxnet operation could be attributed to the US and Israel on the basis of Article 4 ARSIWA if their state organs had conducted it or on the basis of Article 8 ARSIWA and the overall control test if organised and hierarchically structured (hackers’) groups had been involved in the development and deployment of the worm.\nA few policy recommendations can be made following the analysis performed. The law of international responsibility should not fade into oblivion, but it is essential to develop it further in conformity with legal and technological developments shaping our physical and digital worlds. Given the rapid proliferation of cyber warfare capabilities, the reliance of states on various non-state groups—even those specialising in cyber terrorism⁶⁰⁵—for carrying out COs and issues associated with establishing a high degree of state control in cyberspace, the overall control theory must receive more judicial and political attention. Its requirements should be updated in accordance with the current practice of state involvement in COs, the criterion of outward authority symbols can be abolished\n⁶⁰⁴ Alyza Sebenius, ‘U.S., U.K. reveal code flaws abused by SolarWinds hackers’, Bloomberg (7 May 2021), available at: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-07/u-s-and-u-k-release-details-on-russia-s-solarwinds-hackers\n⁶⁰⁵ Thomas M.

As argued by some authors, there could be merit in developing and introducing new theories, such as 'soft control'⁶⁰⁶ or 'working in tandem'⁶⁰⁷ tests, although the overall control concept grounded in customary international law seems to be the more appropriate choice. Furthermore, evidence-related questions must be answered and there is perhaps a need for creating international/regional attribution mechanisms⁶⁰⁸ based on cooperation between states and other organisations and persons with relevant expertise, including those from academia,⁶⁰⁹ that are capable of striking a delicate balance between the secretive nature of attribution and its transparency. More transparency about national attribution efforts is in any case a welcome development that could contribute to further crystallisation of customary international law in this field.⁶¹⁰ Finally, other possibilities for holding states responsible, such as cyber due diligence,⁶¹¹ should be explored in order to prevent international law from being violated through the omnipresent yet distant fifth domain."

The institution of responsibility is at the heart of international law and is part of the constitution of the international community. This being said, cyberspace poses numerous challenges to international law's central objective of ensuring responsibility.'515\nRussell Buchan and Nicholas Tsagourias, 'Special Issue: Non-State Actors and Responsibility in Cyberspace: State Responsibility, Individual Criminal Responsibility and Issues of Evidence', Journal of Conflict &amp; Security Law 21 (3) (2016), 371-381: 377.\nCHAPTER 11 | Pulling the strings in cyberspace\n# Introduction\nNowadays, both state and non-state actors have various technical tools at their disposal that can be used in theory, and are used in practice, to conduct operations in cyberspace with the aim of harming interests of other states and inter alia causing damage to their infrastructures.[516] These so-called 'cyber operations' (COs) are a notion that has a broader scope than the terms 'cyber warfare'[517] or 'cyber war' often used in the literature. This notion is used throughout the Tallinn Manual 2.0 that has been drafted by a group of highly qualified legal experts and clarifies how international law applies to cyberspace.[518] COs are carried out not only in the context of armed conflicts but also in times of peace, and fall under different legal regimes, including humanitarian and human rights law.[519] They are defined as operations that involve the employment of capabilities aimed at achieving certain objectives in or through cyberspace.[520] 'Cyberspace' can be understood as both the physical and non-physical domain consisting in part or in whole of some essential components such as computer systems, communications networks, software, digital information including content and traffic data, and persons and entities using these data.[521]\nA series of distributed denial-of-service attacks were carried out in January 2022 by hackers allegedly affiliated with the Russian government against Ukraine.[522] In April 2022—15 years after the digital attacks[523] on Estonia that,\n\nResponsible behaviour in cyberspace | Global narratives and practice\namong other things, led to the adoption of the abovementioned manual—it was revealed that the hackers' group Sandstorm (often linked to the Russian military intelligence agency) launched a cyber-attack on Ukrainian energy facilities but had been prevented from causing damage.524 This and similar COs are in certain instances perceived as the use of force, which is prohibited under international law, while in other scenarios they fall below this threshold and land in a grey, unexplored zone between war and peace. Importantly, the practice of launching cyber-attacks reveals that states operating in the international arena may use proxies and violate international law without facing responsibility for malicious cyber actors' activities, while at the same time achieving their strategic objectives and advancing their interests.525 In other words, states are capable of acting as 'puppeteers', hiding behind their 'puppets' in the dark of cyberspace and escaping any form of responsibility.526\nThe current contribution investigates the issue of state responsibility for the involvement of states in COs by approaching this subject from the angle of legal attribution. More particularly, it explores the level of state control that is required for attributing operations of private actors posing cyber threats,[527] such as individual hackers and hackers' groups, to states exercising control over them. This study proposes to take into account customary international law that does not prescribe a specific test for examining the degree of state control in the physical world or in cyberspace in every single instance of determining whether an internationally wrongful act has been committed. It argues that there is a need to reconsider the application of the existing control theories in the light of the current realities in order to assess the possibility of legal attribution and assigning responsibility to states exercising varying degrees of control. In addition, it uses the proposed approach for determining the level of state control by applying it to the facts of the case study on the infamous Stuxnet attack involving state actors, which could be seen as a violation of international law.\nThe next section of this chapter gives a brief overview of the doctrine of state responsibility in relation to COs and touches on a number of attribution modes.\n\nCHAPTER 11 | Pulling the strings in cyberspace\nThe section following it deals with the control theories that have been articulated by two international judicial bodies: the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY). In addition, it explains how the question of control should be approached by using the two abovementioned control tests. Then, the findings of the previous sections are used to shed light on the issue of attribution in the case study conducted on Stuxnet. The final section provides a conclusion.\n# State responsibility\nFirst and foremost, cyberspace does not exist in a legal vacuum and international law regulates activities taking place in this 'fifth domain' of warfare existing alongside the domains of sea, land, air and space.528 This means that secondary rules of international law—the law of state responsibility—find application in operations originating in cyberspace, in addition to primary rules of numerous treaties and customary international law.529 International responsibility rules and principles had been laid down in the (Draft) Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (ARSIWA) by the International Law Commission, and the UN General Assembly took note of this important document in its resolution.530 The commission of such acts by states triggers their international responsibility, as indicated by the basic principle of Article 1 ARSIWA, which has been widely applied by international judicial bodies. As a result, new legal relationships between states arise under international law and bring about certain legal consequences, such as an obligation of making reparations for the damage incurred. An internationally wrongful act of a state has been committed if conduct is attributable to the state in question under international law and constitutes a breach of an international obligation of that state, according to\n\nResponsible behaviour in cyberspace | Global narratives and practice\nArticle 2 ARSIWA. On the one hand, attribution—the subjective element—means that an action or omission of an individual or a group of individuals through whom states act must be attached to a state as a subject of international law, so that it is perceived as a state act.[531] On the other hand, a breach as the objective element entails a violation of international law consisting of not only treaty but also non-treaty state obligations in which a state engages, such as using force contrary to Article 2(4) UN Charter.[532]\nAttribution is a multi-layered process including different dimensions.[533] Firstly, there is technical attribution that is far from unproblematic due to inter alia the use of botnets and IP spoofing and is concerned with identifying the actual perpetrators of COs by using a variety of technical tools and techniques in the context of forensic investigations.[534] Secondly, political attribution deals with connecting harmful activities in the cyber domain to states or entities associated with them. It is performed at the political level, where political consequences of COs and possible retaliation play the core role.[535] Political attribution does not by definition carry the intention of holding other states responsible.[536] This is what legal attribution is used for: assigning international responsibility to states that are to a certain degree involved in COs.[537] It is obvious that the process of legally attributing malicious cyber activities to states is dependent on the output of technical attribution in the form of forensic evidence needed for establishing who the involved states and non-state actors are and what their specific relationships are. Legal attribution is also closely linked to public attribution and both may form part of states' attribution efforts, having not only technical and operational but also strategic levels and resulting in communication to the public, politicians and others.[538] In general, states cannot be held responsible for the conduct of\nUNGA, Report of the International Law Commission – Fifty-Third Session, 35, paras 4–6.\nIbid., paras 7-8.\nNicholas Tsagourias, 'Cyber attacks, self-defence and the problem of attribution', Journal of Conflict and Security Law 17 (2) (2012), 229-244: 233.\nHeather Harrison Dinniss, Cyber Warfare and the Laws of War (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2012), 99-102; Nicholas Tsagourias and Michael Farrell, 'Cyber attribution: technical and legal approaches and challenges', European Journal of International Law 31 (3) (2020), 941-976: 942; Marco Roscini, Cyber Operations and the Use of Force in International Law (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2014), 33; Jack Goldsmith, 'How cyber changes the laws of war', European Journal of International Law 24 (1) (2013), 129-138: 135; Tsagourias (see note 19 above), 233.\nJon R.

Legal attribution or imputation in the law of state responsibility is in essence 'the operation of attaching a given action or omission to a State'.[539]\nThere are four modes of legal attribution derived from customary international law that are of utmost importance to the engagement of states in COs. The first attribution mode, found in Article 4 ARSIWA, concerns the conduct of state organs, such as the armed forces, constituting state acts on the basis of international law.[540] In this regard, functions exercised by state organs are irrelevant, similarly to their positions within the state machinery.[541] What is of relevance is that the status of a state organ must be conferred on a person or an entity by the national law of that state. The second attribution modality is Article 5 ARSIWA, dealing with the conduct of persons or entities that are empowered by the domestic law of a state to exercise elements of the governmental authority and actually act in that capacity. If semi-public entities, private companies and others are involved in COs, are tasked by the internal law of a state with carrying out governmental functions and act in breach of international obligations of that state, the latter can be held responsible.[542] The third applicable type of attribution is Article 11 ARSIWA, dealing with situations when non-state actors' actions or omissions are acknowledged and adopted by a state as its own.[543] This should not be a sole support of such conduct but a state is required to consider it as its own and, for instance, take steps to ensure that the conduct does not stop.[544] Clearly, in practice states would rarely go as far as to use their official organs and individuals or entities exercising governmental authority to directly conduct COs violating international law or to acknowledge and adopt such operations as their own. If they do, however, the attribution grounds presented in Articles 4, 5 and 11 ARSIWA will be expected to be applicable and the application of these\n\nResponsible behaviour in cyberspace | Global narratives and practice\nprovisions in cyberspace will be less problematic than the final and most significant mode of attribution laid down in Article 8 ARSIWA.545 It is about the conduct of non-state actors operating on instructions of states or under their direction and control.546 In the case of instructions, intentions of a state must be manifestly indicated with respect to international law violations that are authorised by it.547 With respect to direction, the commission of those violations must be directed by a state providing instructions to non-state actors in a constant manner.548 It is difficult to prove that instructions have been given or that direction has taken place.549 State control appears to be a more practically relevant manner of legally attributing private conduct under Article 8 ARSIWA, which at the same time also poses a number of legal problems, to be tackled below.\n# Control theories in the age of cyber\nDelving into the question of state control exercised over COs and actors participating in them as the most valuable type of legal attribution outlined in Article 8 ARSIWA requires elaboration of two control theories: the effective control test put forward by the ICJ and the ICTY's overall control test. Both theories are discussed in the context of state responsibility in the original Tallinn Manual, but the 2.0 version mentions only the ICJ's perspective and its approach as seemingly the leading theory for attribution on the basis of control without much further explanation.[550]\nIn its judgment in the Nicaragua case, the ICJ held that the conduct of contras would trigger international responsibility of the US if it was proved that the state had effectively controlled the military or paramilitary operations during which\n\nCHAPTER 11 | Pulling the strings in cyberspace\ninternational law violations had taken place. Involvement of the state in the form of financing, equipping or providing training to the contras, participation in the operational planning and general state control would not be sufficient to conclude that the perpetration of acts contrary to international law was directed or enforced by that state. The ‘effective control’ test has a significantly high threshold and is hard to satisfy in practice: it requires a state to effectively determine how COs breaching its international law obligations are to be conducted and to monitor their execution on a continuous basis. In the judgment in the Bosnian Genocide case, the ICJ stated that the effective control theory is the one to be followed for the purposes of Article 8 ARSIWA rather than the easier to meet ‘overall control’ test enunciated by the ICTY in the Tadić decision. Although the discussion might seem to have ended there, much can be said about the necessity for applying a control theory with a lower threshold that would not allow states to escape international responsibility by using non-state actors controlled by them.\nIt follows from the reasoning of the ICTY’s Appeals Chamber that the required level of state control over individuals and groups of individuals is different in nature: this idea was supported by the vice-president of the ICJ, Awn Shawkat Al-Khasawneh, in the Bosnian Genocide case, who drew attention to the fact that ‘the test of control is a variable one’. In this regard, two factual scenarios should be distinguished in cyberspace: (1) private individuals or unorganised groups of individuals conducting COs and engaging in violations of international law on behalf of states; (2) organised and hierarchically structured groups of individuals committing those violations. The first situation would require the degree of state control over COs to be effective in order to make legal attribution possible. For the second scenario, state control of an overall character over\n Case Concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v.

An argument can be made that synchronously with numerous technological developments taking place nowadays, the law of international responsibility, including attribution rules, which is based in customary international law, is constantly evolving and should not be considered static. The adoption of more flexible attribution standards can, for instance, be observed in the area of anti-terrorism.562\nBy acknowledging the widespread reliance of states on ICT and rethinking the existing international law rules and principles, the focus must be put back on the overall control theory. This control test is supported by state and judicial practice,563 has a lower threshold564 than the effective control theory and can be useful in establishing the actual close relationship between states and organised and hierarchically structured groups acting in cyberspace. Such groups must,\n\nCHAPTER 11 | Pulling the strings in cyberspace\n\nA structure that a group has does not need to be of military nature. Arguably, a degree of organisation making group members understand their position and function within a group would be sufficient. In addition, a well-structured group can only be functional if there is a chain of command, meaning that individual members should not be operating on their own but must be subjected to the authority of their superiors, who are expected to steer the group's activities.567 A set of rules according to which a group functions implies not only written but also unwritten rules that must be observed by its members. These three criteria could possibly be met by the groups of individuals acting on behalf of states in cyberspace, but it is also the case that hackers and others using advanced cyber tools to cause harm and destruction cannot easily be distinguished from civilians, given that this distinction is certainly more blurred in the context of COs. The fourth requirement, of outward symbols of authority, is more relevant to the engagement of military and paramilitary units in armed conflicts who wear special uniforms, carry weapons and are distinguishable from civilians, and should not be regarded as the core one. This follows from the reasoning of the ICTY referring to the Stephens case, in which the Mexico-United States General Claims Commission used the overall control test despite the fact that the irregular armed group had not had uniforms and insignia.568 Logically, it is to be observed that groups carrying out COs on behalf of states can meet the identified criteria.\nIn conclusion, both the effective and overall control theories are useful instruments in determining the extent of control exercised by states in relation to cyber non-state actors and their operations and in attributing breaches of international\n\nResponsible behaviour in cyberspace | Global narratives and practice\nlaw to those states on the basis of Article 8 ARSIWA. In the light of recent technological advances, they are not solely applicable to military operations and should be resorted to in the cyber context depending on the specific circumstances of a case in which individuals and groups might be involved.\n# The Stuxnet incident\nIn relations between themselves, states have yet to invoke international responsibility for malicious cyber activities. This could be explained by many uncertainties regarding not only their general unwillingness to prevent further conflicts from escalating but also the application of international law to cyberspace and legal attribution.[569] It is, however, to be expected that a cyber dispute will be adjudicated in the (near) future on the basis of international law[570] and therefore it is reasonable to apply the above considerations to a well-documented real-life scenario and to determine whether and to what extent legal attribution of COs constituting violations of state obligations could be established.\nThe deployment of the malicious Stuxnet worm against Iran has been frequently referred to as the use of the world's first cyber weapon.[571] It has led to the realisation that COs amounting to cyber warfare are a major threat to any state around the globe and can have significant consequences: it is true that many states develop and use similar offensive cyber capabilities.[572] According to the statements by anonymous US, European and Israeli officials, the US and Israel\n\nCHAPTER 11 | Pulling the strings in cyberspace\nwere jointly involved in the Stuxnet operation. $^{573}$  With an aim of sabotaging the Iranian uranium enrichment programme, a covert project code-named 'Olympic Games' was authorised by the Bush administration and further advanced during the Obama administration. $^{574}$  Israel also made preparations for this covert action against Iran and, reportedly, carried out a number of tests before the actual deployment of Stuxnet. $^{575}$\nIn June 2009, the computer worm of around 500 KB (packed with Ultimate Packer for eXecutables (UPX)) and approximately 1.2 MB (unpacked))[576] had infiltrated the computer systems located at the Natanz nuclear enrichment plant via a USB stick and spread via local area networks.[577] Described as 'an unprecedentedly masterful and malicious piece of code', Stuxnet operated in three phases: (1) attacking machines running Microsoft Windows and replicating itself through computer networks; (2) looking for Siemens Step7 software required for programming industrial control systems; and (3) opening access to the programmable logic controllers, allowing the attackers to damage a significant part of the industrial machinery by altering the rotation speed of the centrifuges.[578] As a computer worm of high sophistication, Stuxnet had exploited four Windows zero-day vulnerabilities in a fascinating manner and was able to effectively intervene in the functioning of the centrifuges without revealing itself until it was discovered in June 2010 by a small IT security company from Belarus.[579]\nIt appears that the development and deployment of the Stuxnet worm were certainly not an amateur work of 'a ragtag group of black-hat hackers'.[580] It was an effort possibly undertaken by a large group of skilled professionals who had a\n\nResponsible behaviour in cyberspace | Global narratives and practice\nspecific aim of targeting the nuclear facilities of Iran: 10 people would need approximately two or three years to create it.581 Due to the complex architecture of the worm, its clear destructive intent directed towards the Iranian nuclear plants and its development costs, many experts tend to believe that it could not have been done without involvement of a government.582 While it is not known who exactly initiated the Stuxnet infection, the US and Israeli governments are often claimed to be behind this attack.583 The question is, however: what was the degree of their involvement?\nBefore looking into the question of attribution, one should establish whether an internationally wrongful act has been committed in the Stuxnet incident. For this particular exercise, the order of elements of an internationally wrongful act—attribution and a breach of international law—can be reversed for the sake of clarity, as was done in the ICJ's Bosnian Genocide judgment.584 It could be argued that the Stuxnet operation is a cyber-attack585 constituting the use of force contrary to Article 2(4) UN Charter. This provision, having a customary international law status, prohibits threats or uses of force against territorial integrity or political independence of states or threats or uses of force inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations.586 In this respect, it is not important what type of 'cyber weapon' has been used. The ICJ has underlined in its advisory opinion that 'any use of force, regardless of the weapons employed' is covered by this treaty prohibition.587 The scale and effects of the Stuxnet operation are comparable to the scale and effects of the actual use of armed force that could severely damage or destroy the uranium enrichment facility and render its centrifuges\n\nCHAPTER 11 | Pulling the strings in cyberspace\ninoperative. $^{588}$  It could even be considered an armed attack justifying the exercise of the inherent right of states to self-defence in accordance with Article 51 UN Charter, as some Tallinn Manual 2.0 experts have also indicated. $^{589}$  If the Stuxnet attack was carried out by private actors and is attributed to certain states, these states would be considered to have acted in violation of the use of force prohibition. So far, however, states have not recognised this or other similar cyber incidents as a situation of war. $^{590}$\nThe examination of the possibility of attribution in this case is a rather complicated matter that is used to illustrate the scope of the problem associated with the importance of collecting sufficient evidence to prove states' involvement in COs. Although there is not enough evidence to suggest that state organs of the US and Israel were directly involved in the development and deployment of the Stuxnet worm, there are some claims that the US National Security Agency (NSA) cooperated with Israel on the Stuxnet operation.[591] There are also many markers in the code of the worm indicating the Israeli involvement,[592] and a reference to Stuxnet was reportedly made in a video about military successes of the head of the Israel Defence Forces pointing at the participation of Israeli security forces in the operation.[593] If this is indeed the case and there is more sufficient evidence backing up these claims and going beyond the available circumstantial evidence, the main conclusion will be that this CO carried out by the US and Israeli agencies falling under the definition of state organs could be attributed to the respective states under Article 4 ARSIWA. This is, however, hard to prove.\nGiven that there is also no information on possible cooperation between persons and entities exercising elements of the governmental authority of the\n\nResponsible behaviour in cyberspace | Global narratives and practice\nUS and Israel in the Stuxnet operation and the participation in it has not been acknowledged or specifically approved by any state, as required by Articles 5 and 11 ARSIWA respectively, particular attention should be devoted to Article 8 ARSIWA and it is to be established whether certain individuals or groups were acting on instructions, under direction or control of these states. There are no indications or clear evidence of any instructions or direction provided by the allegedly involved states. Nevertheless, the possibility exists that third parties were engaged in the process of developing and deploying the Stuxnet worm and that they were operating under state control. According to researchers, it does not seem probable that such complex project could have been the result of the efforts of a 'lone wolf' hacker.[594] Given the characteristics of the Stuxnet infection, it is also difficult to imagine that an unorganised group of individuals could have successfully carried out this attack, because the development of such malware requires a high level of coordination and cooperation. As elaborated on in the previous section, legal attribution in these scenarios would be possible if the involved states effectively controlled the operation in question, which is a high threshold to meet.\nConsidering Article 8 ARSIWA and bearing in mind the technically complex and innovative nature of Stuxnet, it is reasonable to assume that—rather than isolated hackers or loose bands of hackers—an organised and hierarchically structured group or various groups of this nature might have acted on behalf of the respective governments: at this point, it is certainly a speculation, albeit one with roots in the facts of other cyber-incidents and theories formulated by experts, linking the development of this malware to cybercrime/cyberattack groups.[595] Under these circumstances, overall control would be the appropriate test to determine whether the two states played a role in organising, coordinating or planning of the CO in addition to their involvement in financing, training and equipping or providing operational support to the group(s). While sufficient evidence to make sound conclusions on this matter is not at hand, a claim\n\nCHAPTER 11 | Pulling the strings in cyberspace\ncould be advanced that the US and Israel organised, coordinated and planned the Stuxnet worm attack and also financed and possibly equipped the hired hackers. A demonstration of the 'unity of goals, unity of ethnicity and a common ideology'596 could be an indication of this. For instance, it has been claimed that the Equation Group—a sophisticated threat actor—worked closely with the NSA as a team of developers behind the Stuxnet malware or assisted the Stuxnet developers in their efforts.597 The NSA probably not only organised, coordinated and planned the actions of this organised and highly structured group, but also paid them for the delivered work and even supplied them with certain tools, such as the advanced keylogger 'Grok' developed by the NSA.598 There are also reasons to believe that operational support had to be provided to that and other hackers' collectives given the high level of sophistication of the execution of this reportedly joint operation. If this was indeed the case and the US and Israel had overall control in the CO, while Articles 4, 5 and 11 ARSIWA were not applicable, attribution per Article 8 ARSIWA would be possible, leading to the international responsibility of both states.599 Moreover, according to Articles 16 and 17 ARSIWA, other states aiding or assisting the US and Israel in the attack or directing and controlling them would also face responsibility if they were aware of the circumstances of the internationally wrongful act, and the attack could be qualified as such act if conducted by them.600\nSimilarly to the imputation on the basis of overall control exercised by the involved states in the Stuxnet case, the attribution of COs that could be categorised as violations of international law in other scenarios—with regard to the prohibition of not only the use of force but also intervention and the principle of sovereignty—will be possible if there is no indication of effective state control. For instance, the global WannaCry 2.0 malware attack from May 2017 was publicly attributed to North Korea by a number of states, including the US and the UK,\n\nResponsible behaviour in cyberspace | Global narratives and practice\nseveral months after its discovery. It has been claimed that the Lazarus Group as a hacking team allegedly sponsored by the North Korean government conducted this attack targeting public and private organisations worldwide. There is no evidence of official state organs of North Korea or persons and entities of that state exercising governmental authority having accomplished this CO unaccompanied by others, and it is obvious that Pyongyang would not acknowledge and adopt this malware operation as its own. Legally proving the exercise of effective control in this particular scenario would be exceedingly difficult, if not impossible: it cannot be proved that the state in question effectively controlled the CO and was able to continuously decide how and when the related activities of the hackers should be carried out, closely monitor the execution of the operation and order its cessation at any given point in time. Although an extensive investigation into the factual circumstances of WannaCry 2.0 by the competent authorities and experts and a high level of transparency on the matter are certainly needed, it can be maintained that the abovementioned hackers' collective receives financial and other support from the North Korean government, which also organises, coordinates or plans COs together with the members of this group, which are carried out on its behalf.\nLikewise, the SolarWinds hack that had targeted various governmental institutions and private organisations in the US and was revealed in December 2020 cannot be legally imputed to the Russian Federation under Articles 4, 5 and 11 ARSIWA, despite the fact that the attack has been attributed to the Russian foreign intelligence service at the political level. This is the case due to the lack of credible evidence indicating that this particular CO was directly conducted by the actors specified in Articles 4 and 5 ARSIWA and the unwillingness of Moscow to consider this unlawful conduct its own. On the one hand, this CO, time and again, illustrates the complexity of imputation based on the effective control test of Article 8 ARSIWA, even if it can be established that the Russian hackers' group Cozy Bear or Nobelium affiliated with the abovementioned foreign intelligence\n Paul Sandle, 'Britain joins U.S. in blaming North Korea for \"WannaCry\" attack', Reuters (19 December 2017), available at: https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-cyber-northkorea-britain-idUSKBN1ED1SK\n Olivia Solon, 'WannaCry ransomware has links to North Korea, cybersecurity experts say', The Guardian (15 May 2017), available at: https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/may/15/wannacry-ransomware-north-korea-lazarus-group\n Danny Palmer, 'SolarWinds: US and UK blame Russian intelligence service hackers for major cyberattack', ZDNet (15 April 2021), available at: https://www.zdnet.com/article/solarwinds-us-and-uk-blame-russian-intelligence-service-hackers-for-major-cyber-attack/\nCHAPTER 11 | Pulling the strings in cyberspace\n\n# Conclusion\nAs explained above, there are still various pertinent issues that can be identified in the process of legally attributing COs to states under the existing control theories. The analysis of the case study of Stuxnet indicates that there is an obvious problem of evidence or—to be more precise—the lack thereof that needs to be solved in the process of technical attribution. Only then would legal experts be able to assign international responsibility to states for malicious cyber-activities. The examination has revealed, in a rather speculative manner, that the Stuxnet operation could be attributed to the US and Israel on the basis of Article 4 ARSIWA if their state organs had conducted it or on the basis of Article 8 ARSIWA and the overall control test if organised and hierarchically structured (hackers’) groups had been involved in the development and deployment of the worm.\nA few policy recommendations can be made following the analysis performed. The law of international responsibility should not fade into oblivion, but it is essential to develop it further in conformity with legal and technological developments shaping our physical and digital worlds. Given the rapid proliferation of cyber warfare capabilities, the reliance of states on various non-state groups—even those specialising in cyber terrorism—for carrying out COs and issues associated with establishing a high degree of state control in cyberspace, the overall control theory must receive more judicial and political attention. Its requirements should be updated in accordance with the current practice of state involvement in COs, the criterion of outward authority symbols can be abolished\n Alyza Sebenius, ‘U.S., U.K. reveal code flaws abused by SolarWinds hackers’, Bloomberg (7 May 2021), available at: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-07/u-s-and-u-k-release-details-on-russia-s-solarwinds-hackers\n Thomas M.

Shackelford, Managing Cyber Attacks in International Law, Business, and Relations: In Search of Cyber Peace (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2013), 17–18.\nResponsible behaviour in cyberspace | Global narratives and practice\nand the alignment between motivations, goals and general backgrounds of involved states and cyber actors is to be taken into account. As argued by some authors, there could be merit in developing and introducing new theories, such as 'soft control' or 'working in tandem' tests, although the overall control concept grounded in customary international law seems to be the more appropriate choice. Furthermore, evidence-related questions must be answered and there is perhaps a need for creating international/regional attribution mechanisms based on cooperation between states and other organisations and persons with relevant expertise, including those from academia, that are capable of striking a delicate balance between the secretive nature of attribution and its transparency. More transparency about national attribution efforts is in any case a welcome development that could contribute to further crystallisation of customary international law in this field. Finally, other possibilities for holding states responsible, such as cyber due diligence, should be explored in order to prevent international law from being violated through the omnipresent yet distant fifth domain.",

The institution of responsibility is at the heart of international law and is part of the constitution of the international community. This being said, cyberspace poses numerous challenges to international law's central objective of ensuring responsibility.'515\nRussell Buchan and Nicholas Tsagourias, 'Special Issue: Non-State Actors and Responsibility in Cyberspace: State Responsibility, Individual Criminal Responsibility and Issues of Evidence', Journal of Conflict &amp; Security Law 21 (3) (2016), 371-381: 377.\nCHAPTER 11 | Pulling the strings in cyberspace\n# Introduction\nNowadays, both state and non-state actors have various technical tools at their disposal that can be used in theory, and are used in practice, to conduct operations in cyberspace with the aim of harming interests of other states and inter alia causing damage to their infrastructures.[516] These so-called 'cyber operations' (COs) are a notion that has a broader scope than the terms 'cyber warfare'[517] or 'cyber war' often used in the literature. This notion is used throughout the Tallinn Manual 2.0 that has been drafted by a group of highly qualified legal experts and clarifies how international law applies to cyberspace.[518] COs are carried out not only in the context of armed conflicts but also in times of peace, and fall under different legal regimes, including humanitarian and human rights law.[519] They are defined as operations that involve the employment of capabilities aimed at achieving certain objectives in or through cyberspace.[520] 'Cyberspace' can be understood as both the physical and non-physical domain consisting in part or in whole of some essential components such as computer systems, communications networks, software, digital information including content and traffic data, and persons and entities using these data.[521]\nA series of distributed denial-of-service attacks were carried out in January 2022 by hackers allegedly affiliated with the Russian government against Ukraine.[522] In April 2022—15 years after the digital attacks[523] on Estonia that,\n\nResponsible behaviour in cyberspace | Global narratives and practice\namong other things, led to the adoption of the abovementioned manual—it was revealed that the hackers' group Sandstorm (often linked to the Russian military intelligence agency) launched a cyber-attack on Ukrainian energy facilities but had been prevented from causing damage.524 This and similar COs are in certain instances perceived as the use of force, which is prohibited under international law, while in other scenarios they fall below this threshold and land in a grey, unexplored zone between war and peace. Importantly, the practice of launching cyber-attacks reveals that states operating in the international arena may use proxies and violate international law without facing responsibility for malicious cyber actors' activities, while at the same time achieving their strategic objectives and advancing their interests.525 In other words, states are capable of acting as 'puppeteers', hiding behind their 'puppets' in the dark of cyberspace and escaping any form of responsibility.526\nThe current contribution investigates the issue of state responsibility for the involvement of states in COs by approaching this subject from the angle of legal attribution. More particularly, it explores the level of state control that is required for attributing operations of private actors posing cyber threats,[527] such as individual hackers and hackers' groups, to states exercising control over them. This study proposes to take into account customary international law that does not prescribe a specific test for examining the degree of state control in the physical world or in cyberspace in every single instance of determining whether an internationally wrongful act has been committed. It argues that there is a need to reconsider the application of the existing control theories in the light of the current realities in order to assess the possibility of legal attribution and assigning responsibility to states exercising varying degrees of control. In addition, it uses the proposed approach for determining the level of state control by applying it to the facts of the case study on the infamous Stuxnet attack involving state actors, which could be seen as a violation of international law.\nThe next section of this chapter gives a brief overview of the doctrine of state responsibility in relation to COs and touches on a number of attribution modes.\n\nCHAPTER 11 | Pulling the strings in cyberspace\nThe section following it deals with the control theories that have been articulated by two international judicial bodies: the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY). In addition, it explains how the question of control should be approached by using the two abovementioned control tests. Then, the findings of the previous sections are used to shed light on the issue of attribution in the case study conducted on Stuxnet. The final section provides a conclusion.\n# State responsibility\nFirst and foremost, cyberspace does not exist in a legal vacuum and international law regulates activities taking place in this 'fifth domain' of warfare existing alongside the domains of sea, land, air and space.528 This means that secondary rules of international law—the law of state responsibility—find application in operations originating in cyberspace, in addition to primary rules of numerous treaties and customary international law.529 International responsibility rules and principles had been laid down in the (Draft) Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (ARSIWA) by the International Law Commission, and the UN General Assembly took note of this important document in its resolution.530 The commission of such acts by states triggers their international responsibility, as indicated by the basic principle of Article 1 ARSIWA, which has been widely applied by international judicial bodies. As a result, new legal relationships between states arise under international law and bring about certain legal consequences, such as an obligation of making reparations for the damage incurred. An internationally wrongful act of a state has been committed if conduct is attributable to the state in question under international law and constitutes a breach of an international obligation of that state, according to\n\nResponsible behaviour in cyberspace | Global narratives and practice\nArticle 2 ARSIWA. On the one hand, attribution—the subjective element—means that an action or omission of an individual or a group of individuals through whom states act must be attached to a state as a subject of international law, so that it is perceived as a state act.[531] On the other hand, a breach as the objective element entails a violation of international law consisting of not only treaty but also non-treaty state obligations in which a state engages, such as using force contrary to Article 2(4) UN Charter.[532]\nAttribution is a multi-layered process including different dimensions.[533] Firstly, there is technical attribution that is far from unproblematic due to inter alia the use of botnets and IP spoofing and is concerned with identifying the actual perpetrators of COs by using a variety of technical tools and techniques in the context of forensic investigations.[534] Secondly, political attribution deals with connecting harmful activities in the cyber domain to states or entities associated with them. It is performed at the political level, where political consequences of COs and possible retaliation play the core role.[535] Political attribution does not by definition carry the intention of holding other states responsible.[536] This is what legal attribution is used for: assigning international responsibility to states that are to a certain degree involved in COs.[537] It is obvious that the process of legally attributing malicious cyber activities to states is dependent on the output of technical attribution in the form of forensic evidence needed for establishing who the involved states and non-state actors are and what their specific relationships are. Legal attribution is also closely linked to public attribution and both may form part of states' attribution efforts, having not only technical and operational but also strategic levels and resulting in communication to the public, politicians and others.[538] In general, states cannot be held responsible for the conduct of\nUNGA, Report of the International Law Commission – Fifty-Third Session, 35, paras 4–6.\nIbid., paras 7-8.\nNicholas Tsagourias, 'Cyber attacks, self-defence and the problem of attribution', Journal of Conflict and Security Law 17 (2) (2012), 229-244: 233.\nHeather Harrison Dinniss, Cyber Warfare and the Laws of War (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2012), 99-102; Nicholas Tsagourias and Michael Farrell, 'Cyber attribution: technical and legal approaches and challenges', European Journal of International Law 31 (3) (2020), 941-976: 942; Marco Roscini, Cyber Operations and the Use of Force in International Law (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2014), 33; Jack Goldsmith, 'How cyber changes the laws of war', European Journal of International Law 24 (1) (2013), 129-138: 135; Tsagourias (see note 19 above), 233.\nJon R.

Legal attribution or imputation in the law of state responsibility is in essence 'the operation of attaching a given action or omission to a State'.[539]\nThere are four modes of legal attribution derived from customary international law that are of utmost importance to the engagement of states in COs. The first attribution mode, found in Article 4 ARSIWA, concerns the conduct of state organs, such as the armed forces, constituting state acts on the basis of international law.[540] In this regard, functions exercised by state organs are irrelevant, similarly to their positions within the state machinery.[541] What is of relevance is that the status of a state organ must be conferred on a person or an entity by the national law of that state. The second attribution modality is Article 5 ARSIWA, dealing with the conduct of persons or entities that are empowered by the domestic law of a state to exercise elements of the governmental authority and actually act in that capacity. If semi-public entities, private companies and others are involved in COs, are tasked by the internal law of a state with carrying out governmental functions and act in breach of international obligations of that state, the latter can be held responsible.[542] The third applicable type of attribution is Article 11 ARSIWA, dealing with situations when non-state actors' actions or omissions are acknowledged and adopted by a state as its own.[543] This should not be a sole support of such conduct but a state is required to consider it as its own and, for instance, take steps to ensure that the conduct does not stop.[544] Clearly, in practice states would rarely go as far as to use their official organs and individuals or entities exercising governmental authority to directly conduct COs violating international law or to acknowledge and adopt such operations as their own. If they do, however, the attribution grounds presented in Articles 4, 5 and 11 ARSIWA will be expected to be applicable and the application of these\n\nResponsible behaviour in cyberspace | Global narratives and practice\nprovisions in cyberspace will be less problematic than the final and most significant mode of attribution laid down in Article 8 ARSIWA.545 It is about the conduct of non-state actors operating on instructions of states or under their direction and control.546 In the case of instructions, intentions of a state must be manifestly indicated with respect to international law violations that are authorised by it.547 With respect to direction, the commission of those violations must be directed by a state providing instructions to non-state actors in a constant manner.548 It is difficult to prove that instructions have been given or that direction has taken place.549 State control appears to be a more practically relevant manner of legally attributing private conduct under Article 8 ARSIWA, which at the same time also poses a number of legal problems, to be tackled below.\n# Control theories in the age of cyber\nDelving into the question of state control exercised over COs and actors participating in them as the most valuable type of legal attribution outlined in Article 8 ARSIWA requires elaboration of two control theories: the effective control test put forward by the ICJ and the ICTY's overall control test. Both theories are discussed in the context of state responsibility in the original Tallinn Manual, but the 2.0 version mentions only the ICJ's perspective and its approach as seemingly the leading theory for attribution on the basis of control without much further explanation.[550]\nIn its judgment in the Nicaragua case, the ICJ held that the conduct of contras would trigger international responsibility of the US if it was proved that the state had effectively controlled the military or paramilitary operations during which\n\nCHAPTER 11 | Pulling the strings in cyberspace\ninternational law violations had taken place. Involvement of the state in the form of financing, equipping or providing training to the contras, participation in the operational planning and general state control would not be sufficient to conclude that the perpetration of acts contrary to international law was directed or enforced by that state. The ‘effective control’ test has a significantly high threshold and is hard to satisfy in practice: it requires a state to effectively determine how COs breaching its international law obligations are to be conducted and to monitor their execution on a continuous basis. In the judgment in the Bosnian Genocide case, the ICJ stated that the effective control theory is the one to be followed for the purposes of Article 8 ARSIWA rather than the easier to meet ‘overall control’ test enunciated by the ICTY in the Tadić decision. Although the discussion might seem to have ended there, much can be said about the necessity for applying a control theory with a lower threshold that would not allow states to escape international responsibility by using non-state actors controlled by them.\nIt follows from the reasoning of the ICTY’s Appeals Chamber that the required level of state control over individuals and groups of individuals is different in nature: this idea was supported by the vice-president of the ICJ, Awn Shawkat Al-Khasawneh, in the Bosnian Genocide case, who drew attention to the fact that ‘the test of control is a variable one’. In this regard, two factual scenarios should be distinguished in cyberspace: (1) private individuals or unorganised groups of individuals conducting COs and engaging in violations of international law on behalf of states; (2) organised and hierarchically structured groups of individuals committing those violations. The first situation would require the degree of state control over COs to be effective in order to make legal attribution possible. For the second scenario, state control of an overall character over\n Case Concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v.

An argument can be made that synchronously with numerous technological developments taking place nowadays, the law of international responsibility, including attribution rules, which is based in customary international law, is constantly evolving and should not be considered static. The adoption of more flexible attribution standards can, for instance, be observed in the area of anti-terrorism.562\nBy acknowledging the widespread reliance of states on ICT and rethinking the existing international law rules and principles, the focus must be put back on the overall control theory. This control test is supported by state and judicial practice,563 has a lower threshold564 than the effective control theory and can be useful in establishing the actual close relationship between states and organised and hierarchically structured groups acting in cyberspace. Such groups must,\n\nCHAPTER 11 | Pulling the strings in cyberspace\n\nA structure that a group has does not need to be of military nature. Arguably, a degree of organisation making group members understand their position and function within a group would be sufficient. In addition, a well-structured group can only be functional if there is a chain of command, meaning that individual members should not be operating on their own but must be subjected to the authority of their superiors, who are expected to steer the group's activities.567 A set of rules according to which a group functions implies not only written but also unwritten rules that must be observed by its members. These three criteria could possibly be met by the groups of individuals acting on behalf of states in cyberspace, but it is also the case that hackers and others using advanced cyber tools to cause harm and destruction cannot easily be distinguished from civilians, given that this distinction is certainly more blurred in the context of COs. The fourth requirement, of outward symbols of authority, is more relevant to the engagement of military and paramilitary units in armed conflicts who wear special uniforms, carry weapons and are distinguishable from civilians, and should not be regarded as the core one. This follows from the reasoning of the ICTY referring to the Stephens case, in which the Mexico-United States General Claims Commission used the overall control test despite the fact that the irregular armed group had not had uniforms and insignia.568 Logically, it is to be observed that groups carrying out COs on behalf of states can meet the identified criteria.\nIn conclusion, both the effective and overall control theories are useful instruments in determining the extent of control exercised by states in relation to cyber non-state actors and their operations and in attributing breaches of international\n\nResponsible behaviour in cyberspace | Global narratives and practice\nlaw to those states on the basis of Article 8 ARSIWA. In the light of recent technological advances, they are not solely applicable to military operations and should be resorted to in the cyber context depending on the specific circumstances of a case in which individuals and groups might be involved.\n# The Stuxnet incident\nIn relations between themselves, states have yet to invoke international responsibility for malicious cyber activities. This could be explained by many uncertainties regarding not only their general unwillingness to prevent further conflicts from escalating but also the application of international law to cyberspace and legal attribution.[569] It is, however, to be expected that a cyber dispute will be adjudicated in the (near) future on the basis of international law[570] and therefore it is reasonable to apply the above considerations to a well-documented real-life scenario and to determine whether and to what extent legal attribution of COs constituting violations of state obligations could be established.\nThe deployment of the malicious Stuxnet worm against Iran has been frequently referred to as the use of the world's first cyber weapon.[571] It has led to the realisation that COs amounting to cyber warfare are a major threat to any state around the globe and can have significant consequences: it is true that many states develop and use similar offensive cyber capabilities.[572] According to the statements by anonymous US, European and Israeli officials, the US and Israel\n\nCHAPTER 11 | Pulling the strings in cyberspace\nwere jointly involved in the Stuxnet operation. $^{573}$  With an aim of sabotaging the Iranian uranium enrichment programme, a covert project code-named 'Olympic Games' was authorised by the Bush administration and further advanced during the Obama administration. $^{574}$  Israel also made preparations for this covert action against Iran and, reportedly, carried out a number of tests before the actual deployment of Stuxnet. $^{575}$\nIn June 2009, the computer worm of around 500 KB (packed with Ultimate Packer for eXecutables (UPX)) and approximately 1.2 MB (unpacked))[576] had infiltrated the computer systems located at the Natanz nuclear enrichment plant via a USB stick and spread via local area networks.[577] Described as 'an unprecedentedly masterful and malicious piece of code', Stuxnet operated in three phases: (1) attacking machines running Microsoft Windows and replicating itself through computer networks; (2) looking for Siemens Step7 software required for programming industrial control systems; and (3) opening access to the programmable logic controllers, allowing the attackers to damage a significant part of the industrial machinery by altering the rotation speed of the centrifuges.[578] As a computer worm of high sophistication, Stuxnet had exploited four Windows zero-day vulnerabilities in a fascinating manner and was able to effectively intervene in the functioning of the centrifuges without revealing itself until it was discovered in June 2010 by a small IT security company from Belarus.[579]\nIt appears that the development and deployment of the Stuxnet worm were certainly not an amateur work of 'a ragtag group of black-hat hackers'.[580] It was an effort possibly undertaken by a large group of skilled professionals who had a\n\nResponsible behaviour in cyberspace | Global narratives and practice\nspecific aim of targeting the nuclear facilities of Iran: 10 people would need approximately two or three years to create it.581 Due to the complex architecture of the worm, its clear destructive intent directed towards the Iranian nuclear plants and its development costs, many experts tend to believe that it could not have been done without involvement of a government.582 While it is not known who exactly initiated the Stuxnet infection, the US and Israeli governments are often claimed to be behind this attack.583 The question is, however: what was the degree of their involvement?\nBefore looking into the question of attribution, one should establish whether an internationally wrongful act has been committed in the Stuxnet incident. For this particular exercise, the order of elements of an internationally wrongful act—attribution and a breach of international law—can be reversed for the sake of clarity, as was done in the ICJ's Bosnian Genocide judgment.584 It could be argued that the Stuxnet operation is a cyber-attack585 constituting the use of force contrary to Article 2(4) UN Charter. This provision, having a customary international law status, prohibits threats or uses of force against territorial integrity or political independence of states or threats or uses of force inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations.586 In this respect, it is not important what type of 'cyber weapon' has been used. The ICJ has underlined in its advisory opinion that 'any use of force, regardless of the weapons employed' is covered by this treaty prohibition.587 The scale and effects of the Stuxnet operation are comparable to the scale and effects of the actual use of armed force that could severely damage or destroy the uranium enrichment facility and render its centrifuges\n\nCHAPTER 11 | Pulling the strings in cyberspace\ninoperative. $^{588}$  It could even be considered an armed attack justifying the exercise of the inherent right of states to self-defence in accordance with Article 51 UN Charter, as some Tallinn Manual 2.0 experts have also indicated. $^{589}$  If the Stuxnet attack was carried out by private actors and is attributed to certain states, these states would be considered to have acted in violation of the use of force prohibition. So far, however, states have not recognised this or other similar cyber incidents as a situation of war. $^{590}$\nThe examination of the possibility of attribution in this case is a rather complicated matter that is used to illustrate the scope of the problem associated with the importance of collecting sufficient evidence to prove states' involvement in COs. Although there is not enough evidence to suggest that state organs of the US and Israel were directly involved in the development and deployment of the Stuxnet worm, there are some claims that the US National Security Agency (NSA) cooperated with Israel on the Stuxnet operation.[591] There are also many markers in the code of the worm indicating the Israeli involvement,[592] and a reference to Stuxnet was reportedly made in a video about military successes of the head of the Israel Defence Forces pointing at the participation of Israeli security forces in the operation.[593] If this is indeed the case and there is more sufficient evidence backing up these claims and going beyond the available circumstantial evidence, the main conclusion will be that this CO carried out by the US and Israeli agencies falling under the definition of state organs could be attributed to the respective states under Article 4 ARSIWA. This is, however, hard to prove.\nGiven that there is also no information on possible cooperation between persons and entities exercising elements of the governmental authority of the\n\nResponsible behaviour in cyberspace | Global narratives and practice\nUS and Israel in the Stuxnet operation and the participation in it has not been acknowledged or specifically approved by any state, as required by Articles 5 and 11 ARSIWA respectively, particular attention should be devoted to Article 8 ARSIWA and it is to be established whether certain individuals or groups were acting on instructions, under direction or control of these states. There are no indications or clear evidence of any instructions or direction provided by the allegedly involved states. Nevertheless, the possibility exists that third parties were engaged in the process of developing and deploying the Stuxnet worm and that they were operating under state control. According to researchers, it does not seem probable that such complex project could have been the result of the efforts of a 'lone wolf' hacker.[594] Given the characteristics of the Stuxnet infection, it is also difficult to imagine that an unorganised group of individuals could have successfully carried out this attack, because the development of such malware requires a high level of coordination and cooperation. As elaborated on in the previous section, legal attribution in these scenarios would be possible if the involved states effectively controlled the operation in question, which is a high threshold to meet.\nConsidering Article 8 ARSIWA and bearing in mind the technically complex and innovative nature of Stuxnet, it is reasonable to assume that—rather than isolated hackers or loose bands of hackers—an organised and hierarchically structured group or various groups of this nature might have acted on behalf of the respective governments: at this point, it is certainly a speculation, albeit one with roots in the facts of other cyber-incidents and theories formulated by experts, linking the development of this malware to cybercrime/cyberattack groups.[595] Under these circumstances, overall control would be the appropriate test to determine whether the two states played a role in organising, coordinating or planning of the CO in addition to their involvement in financing, training and equipping or providing operational support to the group(s). While sufficient evidence to make sound conclusions on this matter is not at hand, a claim\n\nCHAPTER 11 | Pulling the strings in cyberspace\ncould be advanced that the US and Israel organised, coordinated and planned the Stuxnet worm attack and also financed and possibly equipped the hired hackers. A demonstration of the 'unity of goals, unity of ethnicity and a common ideology'596 could be an indication of this. For instance, it has been claimed that the Equation Group—a sophisticated threat actor—worked closely with the NSA as a team of developers behind the Stuxnet malware or assisted the Stuxnet developers in their efforts.597 The NSA probably not only organised, coordinated and planned the actions of this organised and highly structured group, but also paid them for the delivered work and even supplied them with certain tools, such as the advanced keylogger 'Grok' developed by the NSA.598 There are also reasons to believe that operational support had to be provided to that and other hackers' collectives given the high level of sophistication of the execution of this reportedly joint operation. If this was indeed the case and the US and Israel had overall control in the CO, while Articles 4, 5 and 11 ARSIWA were not applicable, attribution per Article 8 ARSIWA would be possible, leading to the international responsibility of both states.599 Moreover, according to Articles 16 and 17 ARSIWA, other states aiding or assisting the US and Israel in the attack or directing and controlling them would also face responsibility if they were aware of the circumstances of the internationally wrongful act, and the attack could be qualified as such act if conducted by them.600\nSimilarly to the imputation on the basis of overall control exercised by the involved states in the Stuxnet case, the attribution of COs that could be categorised as violations of international law in other scenarios—with regard to the prohibition of not only the use of force but also intervention and the principle of sovereignty—will be possible if there is no indication of effective state control. For instance, the global WannaCry 2.0 malware attack from May 2017 was publicly attributed to North Korea by a number of states, including the US and the UK,\n\nResponsible behaviour in cyberspace | Global narratives and practice\nseveral months after its discovery. It has been claimed that the Lazarus Group as a hacking team allegedly sponsored by the North Korean government conducted this attack targeting public and private organisations worldwide. There is no evidence of official state organs of North Korea or persons and entities of that state exercising governmental authority having accomplished this CO unaccompanied by others, and it is obvious that Pyongyang would not acknowledge and adopt this malware operation as its own. Legally proving the exercise of effective control in this particular scenario would be exceedingly difficult, if not impossible: it cannot be proved that the state in question effectively controlled the CO and was able to continuously decide how and when the related activities of the hackers should be carried out, closely monitor the execution of the operation and order its cessation at any given point in time. Although an extensive investigation into the factual circumstances of WannaCry 2.0 by the competent authorities and experts and a high level of transparency on the matter are certainly needed, it can be maintained that the abovementioned hackers' collective receives financial and other support from the North Korean government, which also organises, coordinates or plans COs together with the members of this group, which are carried out on its behalf.\nLikewise, the SolarWinds hack that had targeted various governmental institutions and private organisations in the US and was revealed in December 2020 cannot be legally imputed to the Russian Federation under Articles 4, 5 and 11 ARSIWA, despite the fact that the attack has been attributed to the Russian foreign intelligence service at the political level. This is the case due to the lack of credible evidence indicating that this particular CO was directly conducted by the actors specified in Articles 4 and 5 ARSIWA and the unwillingness of Moscow to consider this unlawful conduct its own. On the one hand, this CO, time and again, illustrates the complexity of imputation based on the effective control test of Article 8 ARSIWA, even if it can be established that the Russian hackers' group Cozy Bear or Nobelium affiliated with the abovementioned foreign intelligence\n Paul Sandle, 'Britain joins U.S. in blaming North Korea for \"WannaCry\" attack', Reuters (19 December 2017), available at: https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-cyber-northkorea-britain-idUSKBN1ED1SK\n Olivia Solon, 'WannaCry ransomware has links to North Korea, cybersecurity experts say', The Guardian (15 May 2017), available at: https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/may/15/wannacry-ransomware-north-korea-lazarus-group\n Danny Palmer, 'SolarWinds: US and UK blame Russian intelligence service hackers for major cyberattack', ZDNet (15 April 2021), available at: https://www.zdnet.com/article/solarwinds-us-and-uk-blame-russian-intelligence-service-hackers-for-major-cyber-attack/\nCHAPTER 11 | Pulling the strings in cyberspace\n\n# Conclusion\nAs explained above, there are still various pertinent issues that can be identified in the process of legally attributing COs to states under the existing control theories. The analysis of the case study of Stuxnet indicates that there is an obvious problem of evidence or—to be more precise—the lack thereof that needs to be solved in the process of technical attribution. Only then would legal experts be able to assign international responsibility to states for malicious cyber-activities. The examination has revealed, in a rather speculative manner, that the Stuxnet operation could be attributed to the US and Israel on the basis of Article 4 ARSIWA if their state organs had conducted it or on the basis of Article 8 ARSIWA and the overall control test if organised and hierarchically structured (hackers’) groups had been involved in the development and deployment of the worm.\nA few policy recommendations can be made following the analysis performed. The law of international responsibility should not fade into oblivion, but it is essential to develop it further in conformity with legal and technological developments shaping our physical and digital worlds. Given the rapid proliferation of cyber warfare capabilities, the reliance of states on various non-state groups—even those specialising in cyber terrorism—for carrying out COs and issues associated with establishing a high degree of state control in cyberspace, the overall control theory must receive more judicial and political attention. Its requirements should be updated in accordance with the current practice of state involvement in COs, the criterion of outward authority symbols can be abolished\n Alyza Sebenius, ‘U.S., U.K. reveal code flaws abused by SolarWinds hackers’, Bloomberg (7 May 2021), available at: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-07/u-s-and-u-k-release-details-on-russia-s-solarwinds-hackers\n Thomas M. Chen, Cyberterrorism After Stuxnet (Carlisle: Strategic Studies Institute and U.S. Army War College Press, 2014); Scott J. Shackelford, Managing Cyber Attacks in International Law, Business, and Relations: In Search of Cyber Peace (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2013), 17–18.\nResponsible behaviour in cyberspace | Global narratives and practice\nand the alignment between motivations, goals and general backgrounds of involved states and cyber actors is to be taken into account. As argued by some authors, there could be merit in developing and introducing new theories, such as 'soft control' or 'working in tandem' tests, although the overall control concept grounded in customary international law seems to be the more appropriate choice. Furthermore, evidence-related questions must be answered and there is perhaps a need for creating international/regional attribution mechanisms based on cooperation between states and other organisations and persons with relevant expertise, including those from academia, that are capable of striking a delicate balance between the secretive nature of attribution and its transparency. More transparency about national attribution efforts is in any case a welcome development that could contribute to further crystallisation of customary international law in this field. Finally, other possibilities for holding states responsible, such as cyber due diligence, should be explored in order to prevent international law from being violated through the omnipresent yet distant fifth domain."

This being said, cyberspace poses numerous challenges to international law's central objective of ensuring responsibility.'515\nRussell Buchan and Nicholas Tsagourias, 'Special Issue: Non-State Actors and Responsibility in Cyberspace: State Responsibility, Individual Criminal Responsibility and Issues of Evidence', Journal of Conflict &amp; Security Law 21 (3) (2016), 371-381: 377.\nCHAPTER 11 | Pulling the strings in cyberspace\n# Introduction\nNowadays, both state and non-state actors have various technical tools at their disposal that can be used in theory, and are used in practice, to conduct operations in cyberspace with the aim of harming interests of other states and inter alia causing damage to their infrastructures. These so-called 'cyber operations' (COs) are a notion that has a broader scope than the terms 'cyber warfare' or 'cyber war' often used in the literature. This notion is used throughout the Tallinn Manual 2.0 that has been drafted by a group of highly qualified legal experts and clarifies how international law applies to cyberspace. COs are carried out not only in the context of armed conflicts but also in times of peace, and fall under different legal regimes, including humanitarian and human rights law. They are defined as operations that involve the employment of capabilities aimed at achieving certain objectives in or through cyberspace. 'Cyberspace' can be understood as both the physical and non-physical domain consisting in part or in whole of some essential components such as computer systems, communications networks, software, digital information including content and traffic data, and persons and entities using these data.\nA series of distributed denial-of-service attacks were carried out in January 2022 by hackers allegedly affiliated with the Russian government against Ukraine. In April 2022—15 years after the digital attacks on Estonia that,\n516 Samuli Haataja, Cyber Attacks and International Law on the Use of Force: The Turn to Information Ethics.

Importantly, the practice of launching cyber-attacks reveals that states operating in the international arena may use proxies and violate international law without facing responsibility for malicious cyber actors' activities, while at the same time achieving their strategic objectives and advancing their interests.525 In other words, states are capable of acting as 'puppeteers', hiding behind their 'puppets' in the dark of cyberspace and escaping any form of responsibility.526\nThe current contribution investigates the issue of state responsibility for the involvement of states in COs by approaching this subject from the angle of legal attribution. More particularly, it explores the level of state control that is required for attributing operations of private actors posing cyber threats, such as individual hackers and hackers' groups, to states exercising control over them. This study proposes to take into account customary international law that does not prescribe a specific test for examining the degree of state control in the physical world or in cyberspace in every single instance of determining whether an internationally wrongful act has been committed. It argues that there is a need to reconsider the application of the existing control theories in the light of the current realities in order to assess the possibility of legal attribution and assigning responsibility to states exercising varying degrees of control. In addition, it uses the proposed approach for determining the level of state control by applying it to the facts of the case study on the infamous Stuxnet attack involving state actors, which could be seen as a violation of international law.\nThe next section of this chapter gives a brief overview of the doctrine of state responsibility in relation to COs and touches on a number of attribution modes.\n524 Ryan Gallagher, 'Russian hackers tried damaging power equipment, Ukraine says', Bloomberg (12 April 2022), available at: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-04-12/russian-hackers-tried-damaging-power-equipment-ukraine-says?srnd=technology-vp\n525 Tim Maurer, Cyber Mercenaries: The State, Hackers, and Power (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2018), 22-25.\n526 Rebecca Crootof, 'International cybertorts: expanding state accountability in cyberspace', Cornell Law Review 103 (3) (2018), 565, 569.\n527 Ducheine et al.

In addition, it explains how the question of control should be approached by using the two abovementioned control tests. Then, the findings of the previous sections are used to shed light on the issue of attribution in the case study conducted on Stuxnet. The final section provides a conclusion.\n# State responsibility\nFirst and foremost, cyberspace does not exist in a legal vacuum and international law regulates activities taking place in this 'fifth domain' of warfare existing alongside the domains of sea, land, air and space.528 This means that secondary rules of international law—the law of state responsibility—find application in operations originating in cyberspace, in addition to primary rules of numerous treaties and customary international law.529 International responsibility rules and principles had been laid down in the (Draft) Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (ARSIWA) by the International Law Commission, and the UN General Assembly took note of this important document in its resolution.530 The commission of such acts by states triggers their international responsibility, as indicated by the basic principle of Article 1 ARSIWA, which has been widely applied by international judicial bodies. As a result, new legal relationships between states arise under international law and bring about certain legal consequences, such as an obligation of making reparations for the damage incurred. An internationally wrongful act of a state has been committed if conduct is attributable to the state in question under international law and constitutes a breach of an international obligation of that state, according to\n528 Schmitt (see note 4 above), 3, 12; United Nations, Report of the Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, UN Doc.

A/56/83.\nResponsible behaviour in cyberspace | Global narratives and practice\nArticle 2 ARSIWA. On the one hand, attribution—the subjective element—means that an action or omission of an individual or a group of individuals through whom states act must be attached to a state as a subject of international law, so that it is perceived as a state act. On the other hand, a breach as the objective element entails a violation of international law consisting of not only treaty but also non-treaty state obligations in which a state engages, such as using force contrary to Article 2(4) UN Charter.\nAttribution is a multi-layered process including different dimensions. Firstly, there is technical attribution that is far from unproblematic due to inter alia the use of botnets and IP spoofing and is concerned with identifying the actual perpetrators of COs by using a variety of technical tools and techniques in the context of forensic investigations. Secondly, political attribution deals with connecting harmful activities in the cyber domain to states or entities associated with them. It is performed at the political level, where political consequences of COs and possible retaliation play the core role. Political attribution does not by definition carry the intention of holding other states responsible. This is what legal attribution is used for: assigning international responsibility to states that are to a certain degree involved in COs. It is obvious that the process of legally attributing malicious cyber activities to states is dependent on the output of technical attribution in the form of forensic evidence needed for establishing who the involved states and non-state actors are and what their specific relationships are. Legal attribution is also closely linked to public attribution and both may form part of states' attribution efforts, having not only technical and operational but also strategic levels and resulting in communication to the public, politicians and others. In general, states cannot be held responsible for the conduct of\nUNGA, Report of the International Law Commission – Fifty-Third Session, 35, paras 4–6.\nIbid., paras 7-8.\nNicholas Tsagourias, 'Cyber attacks, self-defence and the problem of attribution', Journal of Conflict and Security Law 17 (2) (2012), 229-244: 233.\nHeather Harrison Dinniss, Cyber Warfare and the Laws of War (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2012), 99-102; Nicholas Tsagourias and Michael Farrell, 'Cyber attribution: technical and legal approaches and challenges', European Journal of International Law 31 (3) (2020), 941-976: 942; Marco Roscini, Cyber Operations and the Use of Force in International Law (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2014), 33; Jack Goldsmith, 'How cyber changes the laws of war', European Journal of International Law 24 (1) (2013), 129-138: 135; Tsagourias (see note 19 above), 233.\nJon R.

Legal attribution or imputation in the law of state responsibility is in essence 'the operation of attaching a given action or omission to a State'.\nThere are four modes of legal attribution derived from customary international law that are of utmost importance to the engagement of states in COs. The first attribution mode, found in Article 4 ARSIWA, concerns the conduct of state organs, such as the armed forces, constituting state acts on the basis of international law. In this regard, functions exercised by state organs are irrelevant, similarly to their positions within the state machinery. What is of relevance is that the status of a state organ must be conferred on a person or an entity by the national law of that state. The second attribution modality is Article 5 ARSIWA, dealing with the conduct of persons or entities that are empowered by the domestic law of a state to exercise elements of the governmental authority and actually act in that capacity. If semi-public entities, private companies and others are involved in COs, are tasked by the internal law of a state with carrying out governmental functions and act in breach of international obligations of that state, the latter can be held responsible. The third applicable type of attribution is Article 11 ARSIWA, dealing with situations when non-state actors' actions or omissions are acknowledged and adopted by a state as its own. This should not be a sole support of such conduct but a state is required to consider it as its own and, for instance, take steps to ensure that the conduct does not stop. Clearly, in practice states would rarely go as far as to use their official organs and individuals or entities exercising governmental authority to directly conduct COs violating international law or to acknowledge and adopt such operations as their own. If they do, however, the attribution grounds presented in Articles 4, 5 and 11 ARSIWA will be expected to be applicable and the application of these\n539 UNGA (see note 17 above), 36, para. 12.\n540 Schmitt (see note 4 above), 87-9, paras 1-7; Michael N.

Both theories are discussed in the context of state responsibility in the original Tallinn Manual, but the 2.0 version mentions only the ICJ's perspective and its approach as seemingly the leading theory for attribution on the basis of control without much further explanation.\nIn its judgment in the Nicaragua case, the ICJ held that the conduct of contras would trigger international responsibility of the US if it was proved that the state had effectively controlled the military or paramilitary operations during which\n545 Kubo Mačák, 'Decoding Article 8 of the International Law Commission's Articles on State Responsibility: attribution of cyber operations by non-state actors', Journal of Conflict and Security Law 21 (3) (2016), 405-428: 426; Delerue (see note 26 above), 150; Schmitt (see note 4 above), 95-99, paras 1-14.\n546 Crawford (see note 27 above), 144.\n547 United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran (United States of America v.

The ‘effective control’ test has a significantly high threshold⁵⁵² and is hard to satisfy in practice: it requires a state to effectively determine how COs breaching its international law obligations are to be conducted and to monitor their execution on a continuous basis.⁵⁵³ In the judgment in the Bosnian Genocide case, the ICJ stated that the effective control theory is the one to be followed for the purposes of Article 8 ARSIWA rather than the easier to meet ‘overall control’ test enunciated by the ICTY in the Tadić decision.⁵⁵⁴ Although the discussion might seem to have ended there, much can be said about the necessity for applying a control theory with a lower threshold that would not allow states to escape international responsibility by using non-state actors controlled by them.\nIt follows from the reasoning of the ICTY’s Appeals Chamber that the required level of state control over individuals and groups of individuals is different in nature: this idea was supported by the vice-president of the ICJ, Awn Shawkat Al-Khasawneh, in the Bosnian Genocide case, who drew attention to the fact that ‘the test of control is a variable one’.⁵⁵⁵ In this regard, two factual scenarios should be distinguished in cyberspace: (1) private individuals or unorganised groups of individuals conducting COs and engaging in violations of international law on behalf of states;⁵⁵⁶ (2) organised and hierarchically structured groups of individuals committing those violations.⁵⁵⁷ The first situation would require the degree of state control over COs to be effective in order to make legal attribution possible. For the second scenario, state control of an overall character over\n⁵⁵¹ Case Concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v.

An argument can be made that synchronously with numerous technological developments taking place nowadays, the law of international responsibility, including attribution rules, which is based in customary international law, is constantly evolving and should not be considered static. The adoption of more flexible attribution standards can, for instance, be observed in the area of anti-terrorism.562\nBy acknowledging the widespread reliance of states on ICT and rethinking the existing international law rules and principles, the focus must be put back on the overall control theory. This control test is supported by state and judicial practice,563 has a lower threshold564 than the effective control theory and can be useful in establishing the actual close relationship between states and organised and hierarchically structured groups acting in cyberspace. Such groups must,\n558 Ibid., 56, para. 131; Roscini (see note 20 above), 37.\n559 Tadic judgment, 58-59, para. 137.\n560 Crawford (see note 27 above), 147.\n561 William Banks, 'State responsibility and attribution of cyber intrusions after Tallinn 2.0', Texas Law Review 95 (7) (2017), 1511; Margulies (see note 14 above), 500; Antonio Cassese, 'The Nicaragua and Tadic tests revisited in light of the ICJ judgment on genocide in Bosnia', European Journal of International Law 18 (4) (2007), 649-668: 654; Tadic judgment, 49-50, para. 121.\n562 Derek Jinks, 'State responsibility for the acts of private armed groups', Chicago Journal of International Law 4 (1) (2003), 88-9.\n563 Tadic judgment, 51-62, paras 124-145.\n564 Delerue (see note 26 above), 134.\nCHAPTER 11 | Pulling the strings in cyberspace\n209\nhowever, have a structure, a chain of command, a set of rules of operation and certain outward symbols of authority, as stated by the ICTY.565 It should not be forgotten that the Tadić decision was rendered more than two decades ago, when cyber-attacks were not a widespread threat,566 which is a lifetime in the realm of technology: therefore, it could be argued that the elements of the overall control test should be re-evaluated. Currently, not only typical armed groups but also hackers' collectives and other groups involved in COs can be highly organised and have hierarchical structures.\nA structure that a group has does not need to be of military nature. Arguably, a degree of organisation making group members understand their position and function within a group would be sufficient. In addition, a well-structured group can only be functional if there is a chain of command, meaning that individual members should not be operating on their own but must be subjected to the authority of their superiors, who are expected to steer the group's activities.567 A set of rules according to which a group functions implies not only written but also unwritten rules that must be observed by its members. These three criteria could possibly be met by the groups of individuals acting on behalf of states in cyberspace, but it is also the case that hackers and others using advanced cyber tools to cause harm and destruction cannot easily be distinguished from civilians, given that this distinction is certainly more blurred in the context of COs. The fourth requirement, of outward symbols of authority, is more relevant to the engagement of military and paramilitary units in armed conflicts who wear special uniforms, carry weapons and are distinguishable from civilians, and should not be regarded as the core one. This follows from the reasoning of the ICTY referring to the Stephens case, in which the Mexico-United States General Claims Commission used the overall control test despite the fact that the irregular armed group had not had uniforms and insignia.568 Logically, it is to be observed that groups carrying out COs on behalf of states can meet the identified criteria.\nIn conclusion, both the effective and overall control theories are useful instruments in determining the extent of control exercised by states in relation to cyber non-state actors and their operations and in attributing breaches of international\n565 Tadić judgment, 49, para. 120.\n566 Collin Allan, 'Attribution issues in cyberspace', Chicago-Kent Journal of International and Comparative Law 13 (2) (2013), 60.\n567 Tadić judgment, 49, para. 120.\n568 United States v.

In the light of recent technological advances, they are not solely applicable to military operations and should be resorted to in the cyber context depending on the specific circumstances of a case in which individuals and groups might be involved.\n# The Stuxnet incident\nIn relations between themselves, states have yet to invoke international responsibility for malicious cyber activities. This could be explained by many uncertainties regarding not only their general unwillingness to prevent further conflicts from escalating but also the application of international law to cyberspace and legal attribution. It is, however, to be expected that a cyber dispute will be adjudicated in the (near) future on the basis of international law and therefore it is reasonable to apply the above considerations to a well-documented real-life scenario and to determine whether and to what extent legal attribution of COs constituting violations of state obligations could be established.\nThe deployment of the malicious Stuxnet worm against Iran has been frequently referred to as the use of the world's first cyber weapon. It has led to the realisation that COs amounting to cyber warfare are a major threat to any state around the globe and can have significant consequences: it is true that many states develop and use similar offensive cyber capabilities.

Described as 'an unprecedentedly masterful and malicious piece of code', Stuxnet operated in three phases: (1) attacking machines running Microsoft Windows and replicating itself through computer networks; (2) looking for Siemens Step7 software required for programming industrial control systems; and (3) opening access to the programmable logic controllers, allowing the attackers to damage a significant part of the industrial machinery by altering the rotation speed of the centrifuges. As a computer worm of high sophistication, Stuxnet had exploited four Windows zero-day vulnerabilities in a fascinating manner and was able to effectively intervene in the functioning of the centrifuges without revealing itself until it was discovered in June 2010 by a small IT security company from Belarus.\nIt appears that the development and deployment of the Stuxnet worm were certainly not an amateur work of 'a ragtag group of black-hat hackers'.

For this particular exercise, the order of elements of an internationally wrongful act—attribution and a breach of international law—can be reversed for the sake of clarity, as was done in the ICJ's Bosnian Genocide judgment.584 It could be argued that the Stuxnet operation is a cyber-attack585 constituting the use of force contrary to Article 2(4) UN Charter. This provision, having a customary international law status, prohibits threats or uses of force against territorial integrity or political independence of states or threats or uses of force inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations.586 In this respect, it is not important what type of 'cyber weapon' has been used. The ICJ has underlined in its advisory opinion that 'any use of force, regardless of the weapons employed' is covered by this treaty prohibition.587 The scale and effects of the Stuxnet operation are comparable to the scale and effects of the actual use of armed force that could severely damage or destroy the uranium enrichment facility and render its centrifuges\n581 Ibid.\n582 Samuli Haataja and Afshin Akhtar-Khavari, 'Stuxnet and international law on the use of force: an informational approach', Cambridge International Law Journal 7 (1) (2018), 99-121: 101-2; Elies van Sliedregt, 'Command responsibility and cyberattacks', Journal of Conflict and Security Law 21 (3) (2016), 505-521: 507; 'Stuxnet: rumours increase, infections spread', Network Security 2010 (10) (2010), 1-2; Bruce Schneier, 'The story behind the Stuxnet virus', Forbes (7 October 2010), available at: https://www.forbes.com/2010/10/06/iran-nuclear-computer-technology-security-stuxnet-worm.; 'Stuxnet may be the work of state-backed hackers', Network Security 2010 (9) (2010), 1-2.\n583 Joby Warrick, 'Iran's Natanz nuclear facility recovered quickly from Stuxnet cyberattack', Washington Post (15 February 2011), available at: https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/irans-natanz-nuclear-facility-recovered-quickly-from-stuxnet-cyber-attack/2011/02/15/ABUIkoQ_story.; Thomas M.

So far, however, states have not recognised this or other similar cyber incidents as a situation of war. $^{590}$\nThe examination of the possibility of attribution in this case is a rather complicated matter that is used to illustrate the scope of the problem associated with the importance of collecting sufficient evidence to prove states' involvement in COs. Although there is not enough evidence to suggest that state organs of the US and Israel were directly involved in the development and deployment of the Stuxnet worm, there are some claims that the US National Security Agency (NSA) cooperated with Israel on the Stuxnet operation. There are also many markers in the code of the worm indicating the Israeli involvement, and a reference to Stuxnet was reportedly made in a video about military successes of the head of the Israel Defence Forces pointing at the participation of Israeli security forces in the operation. If this is indeed the case and there is more sufficient evidence backing up these claims and going beyond the available circumstantial evidence, the main conclusion will be that this CO carried out by the US and Israeli agencies falling under the definition of state organs could be attributed to the respective states under Article 4 ARSIWA. This is, however, hard to prove.\nGiven that there is also no information on possible cooperation between persons and entities exercising elements of the governmental authority of the\n588 Schmitt (see note 4 above), 330-331, para. 1; in addition, the non-material harm and 'informational violence' can be said to be the result of this CO, necessitating the adoption of a broader notion of the use of force under Article 2(4) UN Charter: Haataja and Akhtar-Khavari (see note 68 above), 115-121; Haataja (see note 2 above), 136-166.\n589 Schmitt (see note 4 above), 341, para. 6.\n590 Gary P.

There are no indications or clear evidence of any instructions or direction provided by the allegedly involved states. Nevertheless, the possibility exists that third parties were engaged in the process of developing and deploying the Stuxnet worm and that they were operating under state control. According to researchers, it does not seem probable that such complex project could have been the result of the efforts of a 'lone wolf' hacker. Given the characteristics of the Stuxnet infection, it is also difficult to imagine that an unorganised group of individuals could have successfully carried out this attack, because the development of such malware requires a high level of coordination and cooperation. As elaborated on in the previous section, legal attribution in these scenarios would be possible if the involved states effectively controlled the operation in question, which is a high threshold to meet.\nConsidering Article 8 ARSIWA and bearing in mind the technically complex and innovative nature of Stuxnet, it is reasonable to assume that—rather than isolated hackers or loose bands of hackers—an organised and hierarchically structured group or various groups of this nature might have acted on behalf of the respective governments: at this point, it is certainly a speculation, albeit one with roots in the facts of other cyber-incidents and theories formulated by experts, linking the development of this malware to cybercrime/cyberattack groups. Under these circumstances, overall control would be the appropriate test to determine whether the two states played a role in organising, coordinating or planning of the CO in addition to their involvement in financing, training and equipping or providing operational support to the group(s). While sufficient evidence to make sound conclusions on this matter is not at hand, a claim\n594 Patrick Fitzgerald, 'The hackers behind Stuxnet', Symantec Official Blog (21 July 2010), available at: https://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/hackers-behind-stuxnet\n595 James P.

A demonstration of the 'unity of goals, unity of ethnicity and a common ideology'596 could be an indication of this. For instance, it has been claimed that the Equation Group—a sophisticated threat actor—worked closely with the NSA as a team of developers behind the Stuxnet malware or assisted the Stuxnet developers in their efforts.597 The NSA probably not only organised, coordinated and planned the actions of this organised and highly structured group, but also paid them for the delivered work and even supplied them with certain tools, such as the advanced keylogger 'Grok' developed by the NSA.598 There are also reasons to believe that operational support had to be provided to that and other hackers' collectives given the high level of sophistication of the execution of this reportedly joint operation. If this was indeed the case and the US and Israel had overall control in the CO, while Articles 4, 5 and 11 ARSIWA were not applicable, attribution per Article 8 ARSIWA would be possible, leading to the international responsibility of both states.599 Moreover, according to Articles 16 and 17 ARSIWA, other states aiding or assisting the US and Israel in the attack or directing and controlling them would also face responsibility if they were aware of the circumstances of the internationally wrongful act, and the attack could be qualified as such act if conducted by them.600\nSimilarly to the imputation on the basis of overall control exercised by the involved states in the Stuxnet case, the attribution of COs that could be categorised as violations of international law in other scenarios—with regard to the prohibition of not only the use of force but also intervention and the principle of sovereignty—will be possible if there is no indication of effective state control. For instance, the global WannaCry 2.0 malware attack from May 2017 was publicly attributed to North Korea by a number of states, including the US and the UK,\n596 Dissenting opinion of Al-Khasawneh, Bosnian Genocide judgment, 216, para. 36.\n597 Thomas Brewster, 'Equation = NSA?

Legally proving the exercise of effective control in this particular scenario would be exceedingly difficult, if not impossible: it cannot be proved that the state in question effectively controlled the CO and was able to continuously decide how and when the related activities of the hackers should be carried out, closely monitor the execution of the operation and order its cessation at any given point in time. Although an extensive investigation into the factual circumstances of WannaCry 2.0 by the competent authorities and experts and a high level of transparency on the matter are certainly needed, it can be maintained that the abovementioned hackers' collective receives financial and other support from the North Korean government, which also organises, coordinates or plans COs together with the members of this group, which are carried out on its behalf.\nLikewise, the SolarWinds hack that had targeted various governmental institutions and private organisations in the US and was revealed in December 2020 cannot be legally imputed to the Russian Federation under Articles 4, 5 and 11 ARSIWA, despite the fact that the attack has been attributed to the Russian foreign intelligence service at the political level.⁶⁰³ This is the case due to the lack of credible evidence indicating that this particular CO was directly conducted by the actors specified in Articles 4 and 5 ARSIWA and the unwillingness of Moscow to consider this unlawful conduct its own. On the one hand, this CO, time and again, illustrates the complexity of imputation based on the effective control test of Article 8 ARSIWA, even if it can be established that the Russian hackers' group Cozy Bear or Nobelium affiliated with the abovementioned foreign intelligence\n⁶⁰¹ Paul Sandle, 'Britain joins U.S. in blaming North Korea for \"WannaCry\" attack', Reuters (19 December 2017), available at: https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-cyber-northkorea-britain-idUSKBN1ED1SK\n⁶⁰² Olivia Solon, 'WannaCry ransomware has links to North Korea, cybersecurity experts say', The Guardian (15 May 2017), available at: https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/may/15/wannacry-ransomware-north-korea-lazarus-group\n⁶⁰³ Danny Palmer, 'SolarWinds: US and UK blame Russian intelligence service hackers for major cyberattack', ZDNet (15 April 2021), available at: https://www.zdnet.com/article/solarwinds-us-and-uk-blame-russian-intelligence-service-hackers-for-major-cyber-attack/\nCHAPTER 11 | Pulling the strings in cyberspace\n217\nservice was reportedly behind the operation.⁶⁰⁴ On the other hand, the overall control theory offers a helpful instrument for linking this and similar operations conducted by organised and well-structured groups of individuals in the digital domain to states, if those powerful ‘puppeteers’ play a role in organising, coordinating or planning the activities of their skilful ‘puppets’, while also providing financial and other forms of support to them.\n# Conclusion\nAs explained above, there are still various pertinent issues that can be identified in the process of legally attributing COs to states under the existing control theories. The analysis of the case study of Stuxnet indicates that there is an obvious problem of evidence or—to be more precise—the lack thereof that needs to be solved in the process of technical attribution. Only then would legal experts be able to assign international responsibility to states for malicious cyber-activities. The examination has revealed, in a rather speculative manner, that the Stuxnet operation could be attributed to the US and Israel on the basis of Article 4 ARSIWA if their state organs had conducted it or on the basis of Article 8 ARSIWA and the overall control test if organised and hierarchically structured (hackers’) groups had been involved in the development and deployment of the worm.\nA few policy recommendations can be made following the analysis performed. The law of international responsibility should not fade into oblivion, but it is essential to develop it further in conformity with legal and technological developments shaping our physical and digital worlds. Given the rapid proliferation of cyber warfare capabilities, the reliance of states on various non-state groups—even those specialising in cyber terrorism⁶⁰⁵—for carrying out COs and issues associated with establishing a high degree of state control in cyberspace, the overall control theory must receive more judicial and political attention. Its requirements should be updated in accordance with the current practice of state involvement in COs, the criterion of outward authority symbols can be abolished\n⁶⁰⁴ Alyza Sebenius, ‘U.S., U.K. reveal code flaws abused by SolarWinds hackers’, Bloomberg (7 May 2021), available at: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-07/u-s-and-u-k-release-details-on-russia-s-solarwinds-hackers\n⁶⁰⁵ Thomas M.

As argued by some authors, there could be merit in developing and introducing new theories, such as 'soft control'⁶⁰⁶ or 'working in tandem'⁶⁰⁷ tests, although the overall control concept grounded in customary international law seems to be the more appropriate choice. Furthermore, evidence-related questions must be answered and there is perhaps a need for creating international/regional attribution mechanisms⁶⁰⁸ based on cooperation between states and other organisations and persons with relevant expertise, including those from academia,⁶⁰⁹ that are capable of striking a delicate balance between the secretive nature of attribution and its transparency. More transparency about national attribution efforts is in any case a welcome development that could contribute to further crystallisation of customary international law in this field.⁶¹⁰ Finally, other possibilities for holding states responsible, such as cyber due diligence,⁶¹¹ should be explored in order to prevent international law from being violated through the omnipresent yet distant fifth domain.\n606 Tsagourias and Farrell (see note 21 above), 965.\n607 Allan (see note 52 above), 81.\n608 Tsagourias and Farrell (see note 21 above), 959–961.\n609 Florian J.

The institution of responsibility is at the heart of international law and is part of the constitution of the international community. This being said, cyberspace poses numerous challenges to international law's central objective of ensuring responsibility.'515 Russell Buchan and Nicholas Tsagourias, 'Special Issue: Non-State Actors and Responsibility in Cyberspace: State Responsibility, Individual Criminal Responsibility and Issues of Evidence', Journal of Conflict &amp; Security Law 21 (3) (2016), 371-381: 377.\nCHAPTER 11 | Pulling the strings in cyberspace # Introduction Nowadays, both state and non-state actors have various technical tools at their disposal that can be used in theory, and are used in practice, to conduct operations in cyberspace with the aim of harming interests of other states and inter alia causing damage to their infrastructures.[516] These so-called 'cyber operations' (COs) are a notion that has a broader scope than the terms 'cyber warfare'[517] or 'cyber war' often used in the literature. This notion is used throughout the Tallinn Manual 2.0 that has been drafted by a group of highly qualified legal experts and clarifies how international law applies to cyberspace.[518] COs are carried out not only in the context of armed conflicts but also in times of peace, and fall under different legal regimes, including humanitarian and human rights law.[519] They are defined as operations that involve the employment of capabilities aimed at achieving certain objectives in or through cyberspace.[520] 'Cyberspace' can be understood as both the physical and non-physical domain consisting in part or in whole of some essential components such as computer systems, communications networks, software, digital information including content and traffic data, and persons and entities using these data.[521] A series of distributed denial-of-service attacks were carried out in January 2022 by hackers allegedly affiliated with the Russian government against Ukraine.[522] In April 2022—15 years after the digital attacks[523] on Estonia that, Responsible behaviour in cyberspace | Global narratives and practice among other things, led to the adoption of the abovementioned manual—it was revealed that the hackers' group Sandstorm (often linked to the Russian military intelligence agency) launched a cyber-attack on Ukrainian energy facilities but had been prevented from causing damage.524 This and similar COs are in certain instances perceived as the use of force, which is prohibited under international law, while in other scenarios they fall below this threshold and land in a grey, unexplored zone between war and peace. Importantly, the practice of launching cyber-attacks reveals that states operating in the international arena may use proxies and violate international law without facing responsibility for malicious cyber actors' activities, while at the same time achieving their strategic objectives and advancing their interests.525 In other words, states are capable of acting as 'puppeteers', hiding behind their 'puppets' in the dark of cyberspace and escaping any form of responsibility.526 The current contribution investigates the issue of state responsibility for the involvement of states in COs by approaching this subject from the angle of legal attribution. More particularly, it explores the level of state control that is required for attributing operations of private actors posing cyber threats,[527] such as individual hackers and hackers' groups, to states exercising control over them. This study proposes to take into account customary international law that does not prescribe a specific test for examining the degree of state control in the physical world or in cyberspace in every single instance of determining whether an internationally wrongful act has been committed. It argues that there is a need to reconsider the application of the existing control theories in the light of the current realities in order to assess the possibility of legal attribution and assigning responsibility to states exercising varying degrees of control. In addition, it uses the proposed approach for determining the level of state control by applying it to the facts of the case study on the infamous Stuxnet attack involving state actors, which could be seen as a violation of international law.\nThe next section of this chapter gives a brief overview of the doctrine of state responsibility in relation to COs and touches on a number of attribution modes.\n\nCHAPTER 11 | Pulling the strings in cyberspace The section following it deals with the control theories that have been articulated by two international judicial bodies: the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY). In addition, it explains how the question of control should be approached by using the two abovementioned control tests. Then, the findings of the previous sections are used to shed light on the issue of attribution in the case study conducted on Stuxnet. The final section provides a conclusion.\n# State responsibility First and foremost, cyberspace does not exist in a legal vacuum and international law regulates activities taking place in this 'fifth domain' of warfare existing alongside the domains of sea, land, air and space.528 This means that secondary rules of international law—the law of state responsibility—find application in operations originating in cyberspace, in addition to primary rules of numerous treaties and customary international law.529 International responsibility rules and principles had been laid down in the (Draft) Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (ARSIWA) by the International Law Commission, and the UN General Assembly took note of this important document in its resolution.530 The commission of such acts by states triggers their international responsibility, as indicated by the basic principle of Article 1 ARSIWA, which has been widely applied by international judicial bodies. As a result, new legal relationships between states arise under international law and bring about certain legal consequences, such as an obligation of making reparations for the damage incurred. An internationally wrongful act of a state has been committed if conduct is attributable to the state in question under international law and constitutes a breach of an international obligation of that state, according to Responsible behaviour in cyberspace | Global narratives and practice Article 2 ARSIWA. On the one hand, attribution—the subjective element—means that an action or omission of an individual or a group of individuals through whom states act must be attached to a state as a subject of international law, so that it is perceived as a state act.[531] On the other hand, a breach as the objective element entails a violation of international law consisting of not only treaty but also non-treaty state obligations in which a state engages, such as using force contrary to Article 2(4) UN Charter.[532] Attribution is a multi-layered process including different dimensions.[533] Firstly, there is technical attribution that is far from unproblematic due to inter alia the use of botnets and IP spoofing and is concerned with identifying the actual perpetrators of COs by using a variety of technical tools and techniques in the context of forensic investigations.[534] Secondly, political attribution deals with connecting harmful activities in the cyber domain to states or entities associated with them. It is performed at the political level, where political consequences of COs and possible retaliation play the core role.[535] Political attribution does not by definition carry the intention of holding other states responsible.[536] This is what legal attribution is used for: assigning international responsibility to states that are to a certain degree involved in COs.[537] It is obvious that the process of legally attributing malicious cyber activities to states is dependent on the output of technical attribution in the form of forensic evidence needed for establishing who the involved states and non-state actors are and what their specific relationships are. Legal attribution is also closely linked to public attribution and both may form part of states' attribution efforts, having not only technical and operational but also strategic levels and resulting in communication to the public, politicians and others.[538] In general, states cannot be held responsible for the conduct of UNGA, Report of the International Law Commission – Fifty-Third Session, 35, paras 4–6.\nIbid., paras 7-8.\nNicholas Tsagourias, 'Cyber attacks, self-defence and the problem of attribution', Journal of Conflict and Security Law 17 (2) (2012), 229-244: 233.\nHeather Harrison Dinniss, Cyber Warfare and the Laws of War (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2012), 99-102; Nicholas Tsagourias and Michael Farrell, 'Cyber attribution: technical and legal approaches and challenges', European Journal of International Law 31 (3) (2020), 941-976: 942; Marco Roscini, Cyber Operations and the Use of Force in International Law (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2014), 33; Jack Goldsmith, 'How cyber changes the laws of war', European Journal of International Law 24 (1) (2013), 129-138: 135; Tsagourias (see note 19 above), 233.\nJon R.

Legal attribution or imputation in the law of state responsibility is in essence 'the operation of attaching a given action or omission to a State'.[539] There are four modes of legal attribution derived from customary international law that are of utmost importance to the engagement of states in COs. The first attribution mode, found in Article 4 ARSIWA, concerns the conduct of state organs, such as the armed forces, constituting state acts on the basis of international law.[540] In this regard, functions exercised by state organs are irrelevant, similarly to their positions within the state machinery.[541] What is of relevance is that the status of a state organ must be conferred on a person or an entity by the national law of that state. The second attribution modality is Article 5 ARSIWA, dealing with the conduct of persons or entities that are empowered by the domestic law of a state to exercise elements of the governmental authority and actually act in that capacity. If semi-public entities, private companies and others are involved in COs, are tasked by the internal law of a state with carrying out governmental functions and act in breach of international obligations of that state, the latter can be held responsible.[542] The third applicable type of attribution is Article 11 ARSIWA, dealing with situations when non-state actors' actions or omissions are acknowledged and adopted by a state as its own.[543] This should not be a sole support of such conduct but a state is required to consider it as its own and, for instance, take steps to ensure that the conduct does not stop.[544] Clearly, in practice states would rarely go as far as to use their official organs and individuals or entities exercising governmental authority to directly conduct COs violating international law or to acknowledge and adopt such operations as their own. If they do, however, the attribution grounds presented in Articles 4, 5 and 11 ARSIWA will be expected to be applicable and the application of these Responsible behaviour in cyberspace | Global narratives and practice provisions in cyberspace will be less problematic than the final and most significant mode of attribution laid down in Article 8 ARSIWA.545 It is about the conduct of non-state actors operating on instructions of states or under their direction and control.546 In the case of instructions, intentions of a state must be manifestly indicated with respect to international law violations that are authorised by it.547 With respect to direction, the commission of those violations must be directed by a state providing instructions to non-state actors in a constant manner.548 It is difficult to prove that instructions have been given or that direction has taken place.549 State control appears to be a more practically relevant manner of legally attributing private conduct under Article 8 ARSIWA, which at the same time also poses a number of legal problems, to be tackled below.\n# Control theories in the age of cyber Delving into the question of state control exercised over COs and actors participating in them as the most valuable type of legal attribution outlined in Article 8 ARSIWA requires elaboration of two control theories: the effective control test put forward by the ICJ and the ICTY's overall control test. Both theories are discussed in the context of state responsibility in the original Tallinn Manual, but the 2.0 version mentions only the ICJ's perspective and its approach as seemingly the leading theory for attribution on the basis of control without much further explanation.[550] In its judgment in the Nicaragua case, the ICJ held that the conduct of contras would trigger international responsibility of the US if it was proved that the state had effectively controlled the military or paramilitary operations during which CHAPTER 11 | Pulling the strings in cyberspace international law violations had taken place.⁵⁵¹ Involvement of the state in the form of financing, equipping or providing training to the contras, participation in the operational planning and general state control would not be sufficient to conclude that the perpetration of acts contrary to international law was directed or enforced by that state. The ‘effective control’ test has a significantly high threshold⁵⁵² and is hard to satisfy in practice: it requires a state to effectively determine how COs breaching its international law obligations are to be conducted and to monitor their execution on a continuous basis.⁵⁵³ In the judgment in the Bosnian Genocide case, the ICJ stated that the effective control theory is the one to be followed for the purposes of Article 8 ARSIWA rather than the easier to meet ‘overall control’ test enunciated by the ICTY in the Tadić decision.⁵⁵⁴ Although the discussion might seem to have ended there, much can be said about the necessity for applying a control theory with a lower threshold that would not allow states to escape international responsibility by using non-state actors controlled by them.\nIt follows from the reasoning of the ICTY’s Appeals Chamber that the required level of state control over individuals and groups of individuals is different in nature: this idea was supported by the vice-president of the ICJ, Awn Shawkat Al-Khasawneh, in the Bosnian Genocide case, who drew attention to the fact that ‘the test of control is a variable one’.⁵⁵⁵ In this regard, two factual scenarios should be distinguished in cyberspace: (1) private individuals or unorganised groups of individuals conducting COs and engaging in violations of international law on behalf of states;⁵⁵⁶ (2) organised and hierarchically structured groups of individuals committing those violations.⁵⁵⁷ The first situation would require the degree of state control over COs to be effective in order to make legal attribution possible. For the second scenario, state control of an overall character over ⁵⁵¹ Case Concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v.

An argument can be made that synchronously with numerous technological developments taking place nowadays, the law of international responsibility, including attribution rules, which is based in customary international law, is constantly evolving and should not be considered static. The adoption of more flexible attribution standards can, for instance, be observed in the area of anti-terrorism.562 By acknowledging the widespread reliance of states on ICT and rethinking the existing international law rules and principles, the focus must be put back on the overall control theory. This control test is supported by state and judicial practice,563 has a lower threshold564 than the effective control theory and can be useful in establishing the actual close relationship between states and organised and hierarchically structured groups acting in cyberspace. Such groups must, CHAPTER 11 | Pulling the strings in cyberspace A structure that a group has does not need to be of military nature. Arguably, a degree of organisation making group members understand their position and function within a group would be sufficient. In addition, a well-structured group can only be functional if there is a chain of command, meaning that individual members should not be operating on their own but must be subjected to the authority of their superiors, who are expected to steer the group's activities.567 A set of rules according to which a group functions implies not only written but also unwritten rules that must be observed by its members. These three criteria could possibly be met by the groups of individuals acting on behalf of states in cyberspace, but it is also the case that hackers and others using advanced cyber tools to cause harm and destruction cannot easily be distinguished from civilians, given that this distinction is certainly more blurred in the context of COs. The fourth requirement, of outward symbols of authority, is more relevant to the engagement of military and paramilitary units in armed conflicts who wear special uniforms, carry weapons and are distinguishable from civilians, and should not be regarded as the core one. This follows from the reasoning of the ICTY referring to the Stephens case, in which the Mexico-United States General Claims Commission used the overall control test despite the fact that the irregular armed group had not had uniforms and insignia.568 Logically, it is to be observed that groups carrying out COs on behalf of states can meet the identified criteria.\nIn conclusion, both the effective and overall control theories are useful instruments in determining the extent of control exercised by states in relation to cyber non-state actors and their operations and in attributing breaches of international Responsible behaviour in cyberspace | Global narratives and practice law to those states on the basis of Article 8 ARSIWA. In the light of recent technological advances, they are not solely applicable to military operations and should be resorted to in the cyber context depending on the specific circumstances of a case in which individuals and groups might be involved.\n# The Stuxnet incident In relations between themselves, states have yet to invoke international responsibility for malicious cyber activities. This could be explained by many uncertainties regarding not only their general unwillingness to prevent further conflicts from escalating but also the application of international law to cyberspace and legal attribution.[569] It is, however, to be expected that a cyber dispute will be adjudicated in the (near) future on the basis of international law[570] and therefore it is reasonable to apply the above considerations to a well-documented real-life scenario and to determine whether and to what extent legal attribution of COs constituting violations of state obligations could be established.\nThe deployment of the malicious Stuxnet worm against Iran has been frequently referred to as the use of the world's first cyber weapon.[571] It has led to the realisation that COs amounting to cyber warfare are a major threat to any state around the globe and can have significant consequences: it is true that many states develop and use similar offensive cyber capabilities.[572] According to the statements by anonymous US, European and Israeli officials, the US and Israel CHAPTER 11 | Pulling the strings in cyberspace were jointly involved in the Stuxnet operation. With an aim of sabotaging the Iranian uranium enrichment programme, a covert project code-named 'Olympic Games' was authorised by the Bush administration and further advanced during the Obama administration. Israel also made preparations for this covert action against Iran and, reportedly, carried out a number of tests before the actual deployment of Stuxnet. \nIn June 2009, the computer worm of around 500 KB (packed with Ultimate Packer for eXecutables (UPX)) and approximately 1.2 MB (unpacked))[576] had infiltrated the computer systems located at the Natanz nuclear enrichment plant via a USB stick and spread via local area networks.[577] Described as 'an unprecedentedly masterful and malicious piece of code', Stuxnet operated in three phases: (1) attacking machines running Microsoft Windows and replicating itself through computer networks; (2) looking for Siemens Step7 software required for programming industrial control systems; and (3) opening access to the programmable logic controllers, allowing the attackers to damage a significant part of the industrial machinery by altering the rotation speed of the centrifuges.[578] As a computer worm of high sophistication, Stuxnet had exploited four Windows zero-day vulnerabilities in a fascinating manner and was able to effectively intervene in the functioning of the centrifuges without revealing itself until it was discovered in June 2010 by a small IT security company from Belarus.[579] It appears that the development and deployment of the Stuxnet worm were certainly not an amateur work of 'a ragtag group of black-hat hackers'.[580] It was an effort possibly undertaken by a large group of skilled professionals who had a Responsible behaviour in cyberspace | Global narratives and practice specific aim of targeting the nuclear facilities of Iran: 10 people would need approximately two or three years to create it.581 Due to the complex architecture of the worm, its clear destructive intent directed towards the Iranian nuclear plants and its development costs, many experts tend to believe that it could not have been done without involvement of a government.582 While it is not known who exactly initiated the Stuxnet infection, the US and Israeli governments are often claimed to be behind this attack.583 The question is, however: what was the degree of their involvement?\nBefore looking into the question of attribution, one should establish whether an internationally wrongful act has been committed in the Stuxnet incident. For this particular exercise, the order of elements of an internationally wrongful act—attribution and a breach of international law—can be reversed for the sake of clarity, as was done in the ICJ's Bosnian Genocide judgment.584 It could be argued that the Stuxnet operation is a cyber-attack585 constituting the use of force contrary to Article 2(4) UN Charter. This provision, having a customary international law status, prohibits threats or uses of force against territorial integrity or political independence of states or threats or uses of force inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations.586 In this respect, it is not important what type of 'cyber weapon' has been used. The ICJ has underlined in its advisory opinion that 'any use of force, regardless of the weapons employed' is covered by this treaty prohibition.587 The scale and effects of the Stuxnet operation are comparable to the scale and effects of the actual use of armed force that could severely damage or destroy the uranium enrichment facility and render its centrifuges CHAPTER 11 | Pulling the strings in cyberspace inoperative. It could even be considered an armed attack justifying the exercise of the inherent right of states to self-defence in accordance with Article 51 UN Charter, as some Tallinn Manual 2.0 experts have also indicated. If the Stuxnet attack was carried out by private actors and is attributed to certain states, these states would be considered to have acted in violation of the use of force prohibition. So far, however, states have not recognised this or other similar cyber incidents as a situation of war. \nThe examination of the possibility of attribution in this case is a rather complicated matter that is used to illustrate the scope of the problem associated with the importance of collecting sufficient evidence to prove states' involvement in COs. Although there is not enough evidence to suggest that state organs of the US and Israel were directly involved in the development and deployment of the Stuxnet worm, there are some claims that the US National Security Agency (NSA) cooperated with Israel on the Stuxnet operation.[591] There are also many markers in the code of the worm indicating the Israeli involvement,[592] and a reference to Stuxnet was reportedly made in a video about military successes of the head of the Israel Defence Forces pointing at the participation of Israeli security forces in the operation.[593] If this is indeed the case and there is more sufficient evidence backing up these claims and going beyond the available circumstantial evidence, the main conclusion will be that this CO carried out by the US and Israeli agencies falling under the definition of state organs could be attributed to the respective states under Article 4 ARSIWA. This is, however, hard to prove.\nGiven that there is also no information on possible cooperation between persons and entities exercising elements of the governmental authority of the Responsible behaviour in cyberspace | Global narratives and practice US and Israel in the Stuxnet operation and the participation in it has not been acknowledged or specifically approved by any state, as required by Articles 5 and 11 ARSIWA respectively, particular attention should be devoted to Article 8 ARSIWA and it is to be established whether certain individuals or groups were acting on instructions, under direction or control of these states. There are no indications or clear evidence of any instructions or direction provided by the allegedly involved states. Nevertheless, the possibility exists that third parties were engaged in the process of developing and deploying the Stuxnet worm and that they were operating under state control. According to researchers, it does not seem probable that such complex project could have been the result of the efforts of a 'lone wolf' hacker.[594] Given the characteristics of the Stuxnet infection, it is also difficult to imagine that an unorganised group of individuals could have successfully carried out this attack, because the development of such malware requires a high level of coordination and cooperation. As elaborated on in the previous section, legal attribution in these scenarios would be possible if the involved states effectively controlled the operation in question, which is a high threshold to meet.\nConsidering Article 8 ARSIWA and bearing in mind the technically complex and innovative nature of Stuxnet, it is reasonable to assume that—rather than isolated hackers or loose bands of hackers—an organised and hierarchically structured group or various groups of this nature might have acted on behalf of the respective governments: at this point, it is certainly a speculation, albeit one with roots in the facts of other cyber-incidents and theories formulated by experts, linking the development of this malware to cybercrime/cyberattack groups.[595] Under these circumstances, overall control would be the appropriate test to determine whether the two states played a role in organising, coordinating or planning of the CO in addition to their involvement in financing, training and equipping or providing operational support to the group(s). While sufficient evidence to make sound conclusions on this matter is not at hand, a claim CHAPTER 11 | Pulling the strings in cyberspace could be advanced that the US and Israel organised, coordinated and planned the Stuxnet worm attack and also financed and possibly equipped the hired hackers. A demonstration of the 'unity of goals, unity of ethnicity and a common ideology'596 could be an indication of this. For instance, it has been claimed that the Equation Group—a sophisticated threat actor—worked closely with the NSA as a team of developers behind the Stuxnet malware or assisted the Stuxnet developers in their efforts.597 The NSA probably not only organised, coordinated and planned the actions of this organised and highly structured group, but also paid them for the delivered work and even supplied them with certain tools, such as the advanced keylogger 'Grok' developed by the NSA.598 There are also reasons to believe that operational support had to be provided to that and other hackers' collectives given the high level of sophistication of the execution of this reportedly joint operation. If this was indeed the case and the US and Israel had overall control in the CO, while Articles 4, 5 and 11 ARSIWA were not applicable, attribution per Article 8 ARSIWA would be possible, leading to the international responsibility of both states.599 Moreover, according to Articles 16 and 17 ARSIWA, other states aiding or assisting the US and Israel in the attack or directing and controlling them would also face responsibility if they were aware of the circumstances of the internationally wrongful act, and the attack could be qualified as such act if conducted by them.600 Similarly to the imputation on the basis of overall control exercised by the involved states in the Stuxnet case, the attribution of COs that could be categorised as violations of international law in other scenarios—with regard to the prohibition of not only the use of force but also intervention and the principle of sovereignty—will be possible if there is no indication of effective state control. For instance, the global WannaCry 2.0 malware attack from May 2017 was publicly attributed to North Korea by a number of states, including the US and the UK, Responsible behaviour in cyberspace | Global narratives and practice several months after its discovery.⁶⁰¹ It has been claimed that the Lazarus Group as a hacking team allegedly sponsored by the North Korean government conducted this attack targeting public and private organisations worldwide.⁶⁰² There is no evidence of official state organs of North Korea or persons and entities of that state exercising governmental authority having accomplished this CO unaccompanied by others, and it is obvious that Pyongyang would not acknowledge and adopt this malware operation as its own. Legally proving the exercise of effective control in this particular scenario would be exceedingly difficult, if not impossible: it cannot be proved that the state in question effectively controlled the CO and was able to continuously decide how and when the related activities of the hackers should be carried out, closely monitor the execution of the operation and order its cessation at any given point in time. Although an extensive investigation into the factual circumstances of WannaCry 2.0 by the competent authorities and experts and a high level of transparency on the matter are certainly needed, it can be maintained that the abovementioned hackers' collective receives financial and other support from the North Korean government, which also organises, coordinates or plans COs together with the members of this group, which are carried out on its behalf.\nLikewise, the SolarWinds hack that had targeted various governmental institutions and private organisations in the US and was revealed in December 2020 cannot be legally imputed to the Russian Federation under Articles 4, 5 and 11 ARSIWA, despite the fact that the attack has been attributed to the Russian foreign intelligence service at the political level.⁶⁰³ This is the case due to the lack of credible evidence indicating that this particular CO was directly conducted by the actors specified in Articles 4 and 5 ARSIWA and the unwillingness of Moscow to consider this unlawful conduct its own. On the one hand, this CO, time and again, illustrates the complexity of imputation based on the effective control test of Article 8 ARSIWA, even if it can be established that the Russian hackers' group Cozy Bear or Nobelium affiliated with the abovementioned foreign intelligence ⁶⁰¹ Paul Sandle, 'Britain joins U.S. in blaming North Korea for\"WannaCry\"attack', Reuters (19 December 2017), available at: https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-cyber-northkorea-britain-idUSKBN1ED1SK ⁶⁰² Olivia Solon, 'WannaCry ransomware has links to North Korea, cybersecurity experts say', The Guardian (15 May 2017), available at: https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/may/15/wannacry-ransomware-north-korea-lazarus-group ⁶⁰³ Danny Palmer, 'SolarWinds: US and UK blame Russian intelligence service hackers for major cyberattack', ZDNet (15 April 2021), available at: https://www.zdnet.com/article/solarwinds-us-and-uk-blame-russian-intelligence-service-hackers-for-major-cyber-attack/ CHAPTER 11 | Pulling the strings in cyberspace\n\n# Conclusion\nAs explained above, there are still various pertinent issues that can be identified in the process of legally attributing COs to states under the existing control theories.

Both theories are discussed in the context of state responsibility in the original Tallinn Manual, but the 2.0 version mentions only the ICJ's perspective and its approach as seemingly the leading theory for attribution on the basis of control without much further explanation.[550] In its judgment in the Nicaragua case, the ICJ held that the conduct of contras would trigger international responsibility of the US if it was proved that the state had effectively controlled the military or paramilitary operations during which CHAPTER 11 | Pulling the strings in cyberspace international law violations had taken place.⁵⁵¹ Involvement of the state in the form of financing, equipping or providing training to the contras, participation in the operational planning and general state control would not be sufficient to conclude that the perpetration of acts contrary to international law was directed or enforced by that state. The ‘effective control’ test has a significantly high threshold⁵⁵² and is hard to satisfy in practice: it requires a state to effectively determine how COs breaching its international law obligations are to be conducted and to monitor their execution on a continuous basis.⁵⁵³ In the judgment in the Bosnian Genocide case, the ICJ stated that the effective control theory is the one to be followed for the purposes of Article 8 ARSIWA rather than the easier to meet ‘overall control’ test enunciated by the ICTY in the Tadić decision.⁵⁵⁴ Although the discussion might seem to have ended there, much can be said about the necessity for applying a control theory with a lower threshold that would not allow states to escape international responsibility by using non-state actors controlled by them.\nextra_sections:# Take-down policy If you believe that this document breaches copyright please contact us providing details, and we will remove access to the work immediately and investigate your claim.|# Copyright Other than for strictly personal use, it is not permitted to download or to forward/distribute the text or part of it without the consent of the author(s) and/or copyright holder(s), unless the work is under an open content license (like Creative Commons).|# State responsibility First and foremost, cyberspace does not exist in a legal vacuum and international law regulates activities taking place in this 'fifth domain' of warfare existing alongside the domains of sea, land, air and space.528 This means that secondary rules of international law—the law of state responsibility—find application in operations originating in cyberspace, in addition to primary rules of numerous treaties and customary international law.529 International responsibility rules and principles had been laid down in the (Draft) Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (ARSIWA) by the International Law Commission, and the UN General Assembly took note of this important document in its resolution.530 The commission of such acts by states triggers their international responsibility, as indicated by the basic principle of Article 1 ARSIWA, which has been widely applied by international judicial bodies.

The institution of responsibility is at the heart of international law and is part of the constitution of the international community. This being said, cyberspace poses numerous challenges to international law's central objective of ensuring responsibility.'515\n\nRussell Buchan and Nicholas Tsagourias, 'Special Issue: Non-State Actors and Responsibility in Cyberspace: State Responsibility, Individual Criminal Responsibility and Issues of Evidence', Journal of Conflict &amp; Security Law 21 (3) (2016), 371-381: 377.",
    "CHAPTER 11 | Pulling the strings in cyberspace\n\n# Introduction\n\nNowadays, both state and non-state actors have various technical tools at their disposal that can be used in theory, and are used in practice, to conduct operations in cyberspace with the aim of harming interests of other states and inter alia causing damage to their infrastructures.[516] These so-called 'cyber operations' (COs) are a notion that has a broader scope than the terms 'cyber warfare'[517] or 'cyber war' often used in the literature. This notion is used throughout the Tallinn Manual 2.0 that has been drafted by a group of highly qualified legal experts and clarifies how international law applies to cyberspace.[518] COs are carried out not only in the context of armed conflicts but also in times of peace, and fall under different legal regimes, including humanitarian and human rights law.[519] They are defined as operations that involve the employment of capabilities aimed at achieving certain objectives in or through cyberspace.[520] 'Cyberspace' can be understood as both the physical and non-physical domain consisting in part or in whole of some essential components such as computer systems, communications networks, software, digital information including content and traffic data, and persons and entities using these data.[521]\n\nA series of distributed denial-of-service attacks were carried out in January 2022 by hackers allegedly affiliated with the Russian government against Ukraine.[522] In April 2022—15 years after the digital attacks[523] on Estonia that,\n\n516 Samuli Haataja, Cyber Attacks and International Law on the Use of Force: The Turn to Information Ethics.

Importantly, the practice of launching cyber-attacks reveals that states operating in the international arena may use proxies and violate international law without facing responsibility for malicious cyber actors' activities, while at the same time achieving their strategic objectives and advancing their interests.525 In other words, states are capable of acting as 'puppeteers', hiding behind their 'puppets' in the dark of cyberspace and escaping any form of responsibility.526\n\nThe current contribution investigates the issue of state responsibility for the involvement of states in COs by approaching this subject from the angle of legal attribution. More particularly, it explores the level of state control that is required for attributing operations of private actors posing cyber threats,[527] such as individual hackers and hackers' groups, to states exercising control over them. This study proposes to take into account customary international law that does not prescribe a specific test for examining the degree of state control in the physical world or in cyberspace in every single instance of determining whether an internationally wrongful act has been committed. It argues that there is a need to reconsider the application of the existing control theories in the light of the current realities in order to assess the possibility of legal attribution and assigning responsibility to states exercising varying degrees of control. In addition, it uses the proposed approach for determining the level of state control by applying it to the facts of the case study on the infamous Stuxnet attack involving state actors, which could be seen as a violation of international law.\n\nThe next section of this chapter gives a brief overview of the doctrine of state responsibility in relation to COs and touches on a number of attribution modes.\n\n524 Ryan Gallagher, 'Russian hackers tried damaging power equipment, Ukraine says', Bloomberg (12 April 2022), available at: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-04-12/russian-hackers-tried-damaging-power-equipment-ukraine-says?srnd=technology-vp\n525 Tim Maurer, Cyber Mercenaries: The State, Hackers, and Power (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2018), 22-25.\n526 Rebecca Crootof, 'International cybertorts: expanding state accountability in cyberspace', Cornell Law Review 103 (3) (2018), 565, 569.\n527 Ducheine et al.

Legal attribution or imputation in the law of state responsibility is in essence 'the operation of attaching a given action or omission to a State'.[539]\n\nThere are four modes of legal attribution derived from customary international law that are of utmost importance to the engagement of states in COs. The first attribution mode, found in Article 4 ARSIWA, concerns the conduct of state organs, such as the armed forces, constituting state acts on the basis of international law.[540] In this regard, functions exercised by state organs are irrelevant, similarly to their positions within the state machinery.[541] What is of relevance is that the status of a state organ must be conferred on a person or an entity by the national law of that state. The second attribution modality is Article 5 ARSIWA, dealing with the conduct of persons or entities that are empowered by the domestic law of a state to exercise elements of the governmental authority and actually act in that capacity. If semi-public entities, private companies and others are involved in COs, are tasked by the internal law of a state with carrying out governmental functions and act in breach of international obligations of that state, the latter can be held responsible.[542] The third applicable type of attribution is Article 11 ARSIWA, dealing with situations when non-state actors' actions or omissions are acknowledged and adopted by a state as its own.[543] This should not be a sole support of such conduct but a state is required to consider it as its own and, for instance, take steps to ensure that the conduct does not stop.[544] Clearly, in practice states would rarely go as far as to use their official organs and individuals or entities exercising governmental authority to directly conduct COs violating international law or to acknowledge and adopt such operations as their own. If they do, however, the attribution grounds presented in Articles 4, 5 and 11 ARSIWA will be expected to be applicable and the application of these\n\n539 UNGA (see note 17 above), 36, para. 12.\n540 Schmitt (see note 4 above), 87-9, paras 1-7; Michael N.

The ‘effective control’ test has a significantly high threshold⁵⁵² and is hard to satisfy in practice: it requires a state to effectively determine how COs breaching its international law obligations are to be conducted and to monitor their execution on a continuous basis.⁵⁵³ In the judgment in the Bosnian Genocide case, the ICJ stated that the effective control theory is the one to be followed for the purposes of Article 8 ARSIWA rather than the easier to meet ‘overall control’ test enunciated by the ICTY in the Tadić decision.⁵⁵⁴ Although the discussion might seem to have ended there, much can be said about the necessity for applying a control theory with a lower threshold that would not allow states to escape international responsibility by using non-state actors controlled by them.\n\nIt follows from the reasoning of the ICTY’s Appeals Chamber that the required level of state control over individuals and groups of individuals is different in nature: this idea was supported by the vice-president of the ICJ, Awn Shawkat Al-Khasawneh, in the Bosnian Genocide case, who drew attention to the fact that ‘the test of control is a variable one’.⁵⁵⁵ In this regard, two factual scenarios should be distinguished in cyberspace: (1) private individuals or unorganised groups of individuals conducting COs and engaging in violations of international law on behalf of states;⁵⁵⁶ (2) organised and hierarchically structured groups of individuals committing those violations.⁵⁵⁷ The first situation would require the degree of state control over COs to be effective in order to make legal attribution possible.

An argument can be made that synchronously with numerous technological developments taking place nowadays, the law of international responsibility, including attribution rules, which is based in customary international law, is constantly evolving and should not be considered static. The adoption of more flexible attribution standards can, for instance, be observed in the area of anti-terrorism.562\n\nBy acknowledging the widespread reliance of states on ICT and rethinking the existing international law rules and principles, the focus must be put back on the overall control theory.

Currently, not only typical armed groups but also hackers' collectives and other groups involved in COs can be highly organised and have hierarchical structures.\n\nA structure that a group has does not need to be of military nature. Arguably, a degree of organisation making group members understand their position and function within a group would be sufficient. In addition, a well-structured group can only be functional if there is a chain of command, meaning that individual members should not be operating on their own but must be subjected to the authority of their superiors, who are expected to steer the group's activities.567 A set of rules according to which a group functions implies not only written but also unwritten rules that must be observed by its members. These three criteria could possibly be met by the groups of individuals acting on behalf of states in cyberspace, but it is also the case that hackers and others using advanced cyber tools to cause harm and destruction cannot easily be distinguished from civilians, given that this distinction is certainly more blurred in the context of COs. The fourth requirement, of outward symbols of authority, is more relevant to the engagement of military and paramilitary units in armed conflicts who wear special uniforms, carry weapons and are distinguishable from civilians, and should not be regarded as the core one. This follows from the reasoning of the ICTY referring to the Stephens case, in which the Mexico-United States General Claims Commission used the overall control test despite the fact that the irregular armed group had not had uniforms and insignia.568 Logically, it is to be observed that groups carrying out COs on behalf of states can meet the identified criteria.\n\nIn conclusion, both the effective and overall control theories are useful instruments in determining the extent of control exercised by states in relation to cyber non-state actors and their operations and in attributing breaches of international\n\n565 Tadić judgment, 49, para. 120.\n566 Collin Allan, 'Attribution issues in cyberspace', Chicago-Kent Journal of International and Comparative Law 13 (2) (2013), 60.\n567 Tadić judgment, 49, para. 120.\n568 United States v.

For this particular exercise, the order of elements of an internationally wrongful act—attribution and a breach of international law—can be reversed for the sake of clarity, as was done in the ICJ's Bosnian Genocide judgment.584 It could be argued that the Stuxnet operation is a cyber-attack585 constituting the use of force contrary to Article 2(4) UN Charter. This provision, having a customary international law status, prohibits threats or uses of force against territorial integrity or political independence of states or threats or uses of force inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations.586 In this respect, it is not important what type of 'cyber weapon' has been used. The ICJ has underlined in its advisory opinion that 'any use of force, regardless of the weapons employed' is covered by this treaty prohibition.587 The scale and effects of the Stuxnet operation are comparable to the scale and effects of the actual use of armed force that could severely damage or destroy the uranium enrichment facility and render its centrifuges\n\n581 Ibid.\n582 Samuli Haataja and Afshin Akhtar-Khavari, 'Stuxnet and international law on the use of force: an informational approach', Cambridge International Law Journal 7 (1) (2018), 99-121: 101-2; Elies van Sliedregt, 'Command responsibility and cyberattacks', Journal of Conflict and Security Law 21 (3) (2016), 505-521: 507; 'Stuxnet: rumours increase, infections spread', Network Security 2010 (10) (2010), 1-2; Bruce Schneier, 'The story behind the Stuxnet virus', Forbes (7 October 2010), available at: https://www.forbes.com/2010/10/06/iran-nuclear-computer-technology-security-stuxnet-worm.; 'Stuxnet may be the work of state-backed hackers', Network Security 2010 (9) (2010), 1-2.\n583 Joby Warrick, 'Iran's Natanz nuclear facility recovered quickly from Stuxnet cyberattack', Washington Post (15 February 2011), available at: https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/irans-natanz-nuclear-facility-recovered-quickly-from-stuxnet-cyber-attack/2011/02/15/ABUIkoQ_story.; Thomas M.

So far, however, states have not recognised this or other similar cyber incidents as a situation of war. $^{590}$\n\nThe examination of the possibility of attribution in this case is a rather complicated matter that is used to illustrate the scope of the problem associated with the importance of collecting sufficient evidence to prove states' involvement in COs. Although there is not enough evidence to suggest that state organs of the US and Israel were directly involved in the development and deployment of the Stuxnet worm, there are some claims that the US National Security Agency (NSA) cooperated with Israel on the Stuxnet operation.[591] There are also many markers in the code of the worm indicating the Israeli involvement,[592] and a reference to Stuxnet was reportedly made in a video about military successes of the head of the Israel Defence Forces pointing at the participation of Israeli security forces in the operation.[593] If this is indeed the case and there is more sufficient evidence backing up these claims and going beyond the available circumstantial evidence, the main conclusion will be that this CO carried out by the US and Israeli agencies falling under the definition of state organs could be attributed to the respective states under Article 4 ARSIWA.

There are no indications or clear evidence of any instructions or direction provided by the allegedly involved states. Nevertheless, the possibility exists that third parties were engaged in the process of developing and deploying the Stuxnet worm and that they were operating under state control. According to researchers, it does not seem probable that such complex project could have been the result of the efforts of a 'lone wolf' hacker.[594] Given the characteristics of the Stuxnet infection, it is also difficult to imagine that an unorganised group of individuals could have successfully carried out this attack, because the development of such malware requires a high level of coordination and cooperation. As elaborated on in the previous section, legal attribution in these scenarios would be possible if the involved states effectively controlled the operation in question, which is a high threshold to meet.\n\nConsidering Article 8 ARSIWA and bearing in mind the technically complex and innovative nature of Stuxnet, it is reasonable to assume that—rather than isolated hackers or loose bands of hackers—an organised and hierarchically structured group or various groups of this nature might have acted on behalf of the respective governments: at this point, it is certainly a speculation, albeit one with roots in the facts of other cyber-incidents and theories formulated by experts, linking the development of this malware to cybercrime/cyberattack groups.[595] Under these circumstances, overall control would be the appropriate test to determine whether the two states played a role in organising, coordinating or planning of the CO in addition to their involvement in financing, training and equipping or providing operational support to the group(s).

A demonstration of the 'unity of goals, unity of ethnicity and a common ideology'596 could be an indication of this. For instance, it has been claimed that the Equation Group—a sophisticated threat actor—worked closely with the NSA as a team of developers behind the Stuxnet malware or assisted the Stuxnet developers in their efforts.597 The NSA probably not only organised, coordinated and planned the actions of this organised and highly structured group, but also paid them for the delivered work and even supplied them with certain tools, such as the advanced keylogger 'Grok' developed by the NSA.598 There are also reasons to believe that operational support had to be provided to that and other hackers' collectives given the high level of sophistication of the execution of this reportedly joint operation. If this was indeed the case and the US and Israel had overall control in the CO, while Articles 4, 5 and 11 ARSIWA were not applicable, attribution per Article 8 ARSIWA would be possible, leading to the international responsibility of both states.599 Moreover, according to Articles 16 and 17 ARSIWA, other states aiding or assisting the US and Israel in the attack or directing and controlling them would also face responsibility if they were aware of the circumstances of the internationally wrongful act, and the attack could be qualified as such act if conducted by them.600\n\nSimilarly to the imputation on the basis of overall control exercised by the involved states in the Stuxnet case, the attribution of COs that could be categorised as violations of international law in other scenarios—with regard to the prohibition of not only the use of force but also intervention and the principle of sovereignty—will be possible if there is no indication of effective state control.

Legally proving the exercise of effective control in this particular scenario would be exceedingly difficult, if not impossible: it cannot be proved that the state in question effectively controlled the CO and was able to continuously decide how and when the related activities of the hackers should be carried out, closely monitor the execution of the operation and order its cessation at any given point in time. Although an extensive investigation into the factual circumstances of WannaCry 2.0 by the competent authorities and experts and a high level of transparency on the matter are certainly needed, it can be maintained that the abovementioned hackers' collective receives financial and other support from the North Korean government, which also organises, coordinates or plans COs together with the members of this group, which are carried out on its behalf.\n\nLikewise, the SolarWinds hack that had targeted various governmental institutions and private organisations in the US and was revealed in December 2020 cannot be legally imputed to the Russian Federation under Articles 4, 5 and 11 ARSIWA, despite the fact that the attack has been attributed to the Russian foreign intelligence service at the political level.⁶⁰³ This is the case due to the lack of credible evidence indicating that this particular CO was directly conducted by the actors specified in Articles 4 and 5 ARSIWA and the unwillingness of Moscow to consider this unlawful conduct its own.

The analysis of the case study of Stuxnet indicates that there is an obvious problem of evidence or—to be more precise—the lack thereof that needs to be solved in the process of technical attribution. Only then would legal experts be able to assign international responsibility to states for malicious cyber-activities. The examination has revealed, in a rather speculative manner, that the Stuxnet operation could be attributed to the US and Israel on the basis of Article 4 ARSIWA if their state organs had conducted it or on the basis of Article 8 ARSIWA and the overall control test if organised and hierarchically structured (hackers’) groups had been involved in the development and deployment of the worm.\n\nA few policy recommendations can be made following the analysis performed. The law of international responsibility should not fade into oblivion, but it is essential to develop it further in conformity with legal and technological developments shaping our physical and digital worlds. Given the rapid proliferation of cyber warfare capabilities, the reliance of states on various non-state groups—even those specialising in cyber terrorism⁶⁰⁵—for carrying out COs and issues associated with establishing a high degree of state control in cyberspace, the overall control theory must receive more judicial and political attention.

    "Responsible behaviour in cyberspace | Global narratives and practice\n\nand the alignment between motivations, goals and general backgrounds of involved states and cyber actors is to be taken into account. As argued by some authors, there could be merit in developing and introducing new theories, such as 'soft control'⁶⁰⁶ or 'working in tandem'⁶⁰⁷ tests, although the overall control concept grounded in customary international law seems to be the more appropriate choice. Furthermore, evidence-related questions must be answered and there is perhaps a need for creating international/regional attribution mechanisms⁶⁰⁸ based on cooperation between states and other organisations and persons with relevant expertise, including those from academia,⁶⁰⁹ that are capable of striking a delicate balance between the secretive nature of attribution and its transparency. More transparency about national attribution efforts is in any case a welcome development that could contribute to further crystallisation of customary international law in this field.⁶¹⁰ Finally, other possibilities for holding states responsible, such as cyber due diligence,⁶¹¹ should be explored in order to prevent international law from being violated through the omnipresent yet distant fifth domain.\n\n606 Tsagourias and Farrell (see note 21 above), 965.\n607 Allan (see note 52 above), 81.\n608 Tsagourias and Farrell (see note 21 above), 959–961.\n609 Florian J.
