Despite its prominence, however, the scholarship on deterrence by denial stands to be developed further. It lags behind scholarship on deterrence by punishment on two points: in identifying the conditions under which the strategy works and in examining elements affecting its adoption. Deterrence by denial also carries some conceptual ambiguity since its employment takes many significantly different forms and also because it overlaps with deterrence by punishment. Despite the emphasis in current scholarship on \"inflicting costs\" as a defining element of deterrence by punishment, costs arguably also play a significant role in deterrence by denial. To address these challenges, I distinguish between deterrence strategies by focusing on two main elements: the means the deterrer actor threatens to use (offensive or non-offensive) and the timing of the threatened use of these means (before or after the unwanted activity). This offers a more nuanced distinction between deterrence strategies and better encompasses the role of inflicting costs in deterrence by denial. I suggest that this research offers a useful point of departure to further theorize about deterrence by denial, and it sets a promising research agenda that is pertinent given the growing interest in deterrence by denial, especially in its application to cyber deterrence.\n\nLa estrategia de disuasión por negación es ampliamente utilizada por diferentes agentes.

El conocimiento académico relativo a la disuasión por negación se ha quedado atrasado en comparación con el conocimiento académico relativo a la disuasión por castigo en dos puntos: la identificación de las condiciones bajo las cuales funciona la estrategia y el estudio de los elementos que afectan su adopción. La disuasión por negación también conlleva cierta ambigüedad conceptual, ya que se utiliza de muchas formas, significativamente diferentes entre ellas, y también porque se solapa con la disuasión por castigo. A pesar del énfasis existente en el mundo académico actual en usar el hecho de «imponer costes» como un elemento definitorio de la disuasión por castigo, estos costes también juegan un papel importante en la disuasión por negación.

Néanmoins, malgré son importance, elle ne fait l'objet que de peu de travaux de recherche. Elle a du retard par rapport à la recherche sur la dissuasion par la punition à deux niveaux : quand il s'agit d'identifier les conditions de fonctionnement d'une stratégie et quand il s'agit d'analyser les éléments qui ont une incidence sur son adoption. La dissuasion par le déni s'accompagne également d'une certaine ambiguïté conceptuelle, car son emploi revêt des formes très différentes et elle a tendance à recouper la dissuasion par la punition. Malgré l'accent actuel des recherches sur les « coûts infligés » comme élément définitoire de la dissuasion par la punition, ceux-ci pourraient bien aussi jouer un rôle important dans la dissuasion par le déni. Pour répondre à ces défis, je distingue les stratégies de dissuasion en me concentrant sur deux éléments principaux : les moyens que l'acteur dissuasif menace d'utiliser (offensifs ou non) et la temporalité d'application de cette menace (avant ou après l'activité indésirable). Ainsi apparaît une distinction plus nuancée des stratégies de dissuasion, qui représente plus justement le rôle des coûts infligés dans la dissuasion par le déni. Selon moi, ce travail de recherche propose un point de départ utile quand il s'agit de pousser la théorisation de la dissuasion par le déni et un programme de recherche prometteur et pertinent, étant donné l'intérêt croissant pour la dissuasion par le déni, en particulier pour son application de cyberdissuasion.\n\nKeywords: deterrence, deterrence by denial\nPalabras clave: disuasión, disuasión por negación\nMots clés: dissuasion, dissuasion par le déni\n\n# Introduction\n\nA key classical distinction in deterrence scholarship is between deterrence by punishment and deterrence by denial. Suggested as early as the late 1950s, this distinction in its original formulation focuses on whether the deterrent threat emphasizes the cost for the putative challengers if they execute the undesired activity (deterrence by punishment) or puts into question the challenger's ability to achieve its goals (deterrence by denial) (Snyder 1959). As Wilner and Wenger (2021, 7) explain, \"[W]hereas punishment manipulates behavior by augmenting costs, denial works by stripping away benefits ... so whereas punishment deters through the fear of pain, denial deters through the fear of failure.\" This distinction has been important for the emergence of deterrence research. Given the prominence of nuclear deterrence and its impact on this research, the concept of deterrence by punishment is conspicuous in how the study emerged (Morgan 2021, 18).\n\nIt is only in recent years that the concept of deterrence by denial has started to attract greater attention (e.g., Smith and Talbot 2008; Gearson 2012; Brantly 2018; Adamsky 2021; Wenger and Wilner 2021; Zilincik and Swejs 2023; Borghard and Lonergan 2023). This shift is due mainly to changes in the threat environment—the advancement of new regional and global powers on the one hand, and the grow",

These changes have clarified the need for alternatives to the dominant strategy of deterrence by punishment. For example, some studies have suggested cyber deterrence by denial as an alternative because of the challenges of successfully implementing cyber deterrence by punishment (Iasiello 2013; Nye 2017, 56--57; Libicki 2021), mainly the problem of attribution (Nye 2017, 56; Schneider 2019, 112; Morgan 2021, 17). In addition, organizational competencies and technological developments, such as the advancement of better defensive measures enhance the attractiveness of the strategy of deterrence by denial (e.g. Slayton 2017, 89--90; Lilli 2021, 171; Lupovici 2021, 1687).\n\nI argue, however, that despite the advantages of the concept of deterrence by denial, it can be further developed theoretically and clarified conceptually. Foremost, while there is a consensus among scholars regarding key factors affecting the success of deterrence by punishment, that is, capability, credibility, and communication (e.g. Morgan 2003, 15--20), much less has been theorized about the conditions under which deterrence by denial succeeds. Likewise, the research could also be developed with regard to studying the adoption of deterrence by denial. For example, while some studies have focused on the social and cultural elements affecting the adoption of deterrence by punishment (Knopf 2013; Lupovici 2016; Adamsky 2017, 166--71), we know much less in this regard about the adoption of deterrence by denial strategies (but see Målksoo2021).\n\nSecond, deterrence by denial refers to various distinct mechanisms—such as defense, resilience, denial, and prevention—grouped under one category. This ambiguity not only reveals the need to clarify and map the sub-categories of deterrence by denial, but it also aggravates the challenge in studying the success of deterrence by denial—that is, in determining whether each sub-category of deterrence by denial is successful under the same conditions. In addition, and even more challenging, is the overlap between deterrence by punishment and deterrence by denial. As I discuss below, contrary to common wisdom that emphasizes the clear distinction between deterrence by punishment and deterrence by denial, both strategies concern the sensitivity of the putative challenger to “costs.” In other words, while I agree that deterrence by denial focuses on the fear of failure, this strategy is also affected by the manipulation of actors' sensitivity to “costs.” Therefore, inflicting “costs,” while considered a key element of deterrence by punishment, provides a limited borderline between deterrence by punishment and deterrence by denial since it plays a significant role in both kinds of deterrence. Some scholars have put this idea forward: for example, Brantly (2018, 35) clearly argues that both “[d]eterrence by punishment and denial are intended to manipulate the cost-benefit analysis of an adversary.” Likewise, a number of scholars have acknowledged the importance of incurring costs for deterrence by denial (e.g. Gross Stein and Levi 2015, 411; Nye 2017, 56; Mazarr 2018, 6; Libicki 2021, 192; Sawyer 2021, 111; Matania and Bachrach 2023; Zilincik and Sweijs 2023, 261). However, rather than seeing this finding as an obstacle, I argue it is an opportunity not only to clarify this strategy but also to develop a more extensive concept of deterrence in general as well as of deterrence by denial specifically.\n\nTo achieve this goal, I offer a new conceptualization of deterrence based on two elements: the means used by the deterrer actor to threaten (offensive or non-offensive) and the timing of the threatened use of these means (before or after the unwanted activity occurs). This theoretical move provides a way to clarify the concept of deterrence by denial and a better way to distinguish among different types of deterrence strategies, including by punishment and by denial, and thus avoids the binary distinction between them. Furthermore, this move offers a useful point of departure to advance the research of deterrence by denial success, which lags behind the research of deterrence by punishment success (Gross Stein and Levi 2015, 411; Wilner and Wenger 2021, 7; Zilincik and Sweijs 2023, 249). For example, if we",

As a result, while it is beyond the scope of this paper to fully explore deterrence success, I do aim to demonstrate the advantages of the suggested conceptualization toward this goal.\n\nThe article unfolds as follows. In the first section, I identify a few issues on which the research of deterrence by denial could be further developed. In the second, I suggest the new conceptualization of deterrence, based on the distinction among four different categories, and illustrate them through kinetic and cyber deterrence practices. In the third section, I consider the advantages of this conceptualization regarding the main challenges of the study of deterrence by denial. I conclude by discussing further implications for deterrence scholarship.\n\n## The Concept of Deterrence by Denial and its Limitations\n\nI argue that the concept of deterrence by denial could be developed further in two interrelated ways: by elaborating on the conditions under which it succeeds and is adopted and by addressing its conceptual ambiguity.\n\n## The Need for Further Development of Theoretical Explanations for Deterrence by Denial\n\n### Deterrence Success\n\nIn contrast to the rich scholarship of deterrence by punishment, much less is known about the conditions under which the strategy of deterrence by denial works. Scholars agree that the conditions needed for deterrence by punishment are based on defenders' capabilities, credibility, and communication (Morgan 2003, 15-20); however, no such clear articulation of the conditions for deterrence by denial exists. For example, we do not fully know whether the traditional conditions for success of deterrence by punishment are relevant to deterrence by denial or whether we need to consider other conditions, nor do we know how actors deliver their threats in deterrence by denial strategies. While researchers have recently started to engage more specifically with these types of questions (Gearson 2012, 188; Schneider 2019, 113-4; Libicki 2021, 196, 198; Wilner 2021, 54), the scholarship still requires more comprehensive theoretical discussion and empirical studies of these conditions. What we currently have are specific assertions about particular factors that might affect deterrence success, for example, from scholars who study conventional deterrence and focus on deterrence by denial based on military capabilities (e.g., Mearsheimer 1983, 24-30, 62-6). However, as I will further discuss below, deterrence by denial does not rely exclusively on offensive capabilities or on military means in general.\n\n### Deterrence Adoption\n\nTheories of deterrence by denial could also be developed through studies elaborating on how and when actors adopt this strategy (Lupovici 2021, 1687). Most deterrence scholars focus on deterrence success rather than on its adoption. As Lupovici (2021) points out, diverting the focus to the adoption of the strategy might be useful, especially when details about deterrence success are limited or difficult to attain. Scholars have already started to explore two main elements that affect the adoption of the strategy: technological changes and cultural and social elements.\n\n1. Scholars have noted that its implementation in specific contexts could also be further developed. For example, despite the growing interest in studying deterrence by denial in the cyber domain, Borghard and Lonergan (2023, 534-5) conclude that the scholarship's “lack of systematic assessment of how traditional denial concepts, especially those developed in the conventional deterrence literature, could be extended to cyberspace.”\n\n2. Mearsheimer’s book on conventional deterrence focuses on situations of “denying an aggressor his battlefield objectives with conventional forces” (1983, 15, my emphasis).",

            "markdown": "AMIR LUPOVICI\n\nHowever, these studies have mainly been in the context of deterrence by punishment. For example, some scholars have pointed to how technological changes eased the development and adoption of deterrence by punishment during the Cold War (Kratochwil 1978, 155–6; Cranesale et al. 1983, 30–2; Kaplan 1991, 111; Gundersen 1994, 295). In a similar way, scholars have shown how social elements such as culture, identity, and routines shape the adoption and implementation of practices of deterrence by punishment in different contexts (Basrur 2006, 49–79; Knopf 2013; Lupovici 2016; Adamsky 2017, 166–71). However, similar questions could be asked about deterrence by denial (e.g., Målksoo 2021): for example, whether deterrence by denial allows actors to maintain their prestige and status in the same manner as deterrence through punishment and retaliation.\n\n## Conceptual Ambiguity\n\nThe challenge of conceptual ambiguity arises from the various kinds of means of employing the strategy of deterrence by denial and from the difficulty of clearly distinguishing between deterrence by denial and deterrence by punishment.\n\n## Multiple Strategies\n\nWhile scholars who explored deterrence by denial originally tended to regard it as based primarily on defensive measures (e.g., Buzan 1987, 135), recent studies agree that deterrence by denial can be achieved in various ways (Zilincik and Sweijs 2023). As Borghard and Lonergan (2023, 541) argue, “While defense can be one mechanism that contributes to deterrence by denial, it is not the only—or even primary—means of achieving denial.” More recent scholarship has also pointed to different means to practice deterrence by denial, such as de-legitimization (Gearson 2012, 183; Stein Gross and Levi 2015, 416), resilience (Nye 2017, 56; Libicki 2021, 205), and law enforcement activities (Borghard and Lonergan 2023, 553); as well as long-term effects based on repeated failures at both strategic and tactical levels (Tor 2017, 108; Wilner 2021, 50–1).\n\nAlthough it is important to acknowledge the different means through which actors can operate deterrence by denial, a more comprehensive framework would provide a systematic way to categorize the various types of deterrence and thus to effectively compare and contrast among strategies of deterrence by denial and deterrence by punishment. This would also be important given the need to elucidate the conditions under which this strategy works (or is adopted). In other words, it would help to show whether different conditions are necessary for success for different sub-categories of deterrence by denial.\n\n## Overlap of “Costs”\n\nAs Wilner and Wenger (2021, 7) observe, scholars suggest that the effect of deterrence by punishment is achieved by fear of retaliation, and the deterrent effect of deterrence by denial is achieved by fear of failure (see also von Hlatky 2015, 4). While they aptly summarize the scholarship, I suggest that the distinction between deterrence by punishment and deterrence by denial is not as clear as many scholars assume.\n\nFirst, as Buzan (1987, 135), for example, has noted, “[I]n military terms, denial and defense have virtually identical meanings. Those who treat deterrence and defence as alternatives are assuming that deterrence is likewise synonymous with retaliation.” According to Buzan (1987, 136), since the purpose of deterrence is to prevent “unwanted actions before they occur... [L]ogically, therefore the concept of deterrence encompasses both denial and retaliation” (italics in original).\n\n3 While Buzan (1987) is correct to suggest that defense and denial are both methods of deterrence, along with the threat of punishment (retaliation), it should also be noted that Buzan limits his discussion to military strategies. This is",

            "markdown": "However, the concern runs even deeper. The question is not whether punishment, denial, and defense should or could be seen as different methods of deterrence. Rather, what is in question is the attempt to fully distinguish between deterrence by punishment and deterrence by denial through the distinction between emphasizing costs for the putative challenger (deterrence by punishment) and emphasizing the challenger's ability to attain its goal (deterrence by denial).\n\nWhile fear—of failure and of inability to achieve a goal—is a constitutive element of deterrence by denial, it is only part of the deterrent mechanism. It can be suggested that “costs” also play an important role in the practices of deterrence by denial. While certain scholars do acknowledge this argument (e.g. Nye 2017, 56; Brantly 2018, 35; Mazarr 2018, 6; Sawyer 2021, 111; Matania and Bachrach 2023), some see it as being of limited importance. Gross Stein and Levi (2015, 411), for example, argue that the tactics of deterrence by denial “play principally on increasing the likelihood of failure, and only indirectly on cost.”\n\nThe point, however, is that effective deterrence may be attained by making it clear to the putative challengers that executing the undesired activity will be costly not because of retaliation but rather because of the costs involved in executing it. These are the potential costs the putative challenger would have to invest to acquire the means and carry out the unwanted action. When the costs associated with an activity the defender tries to prevent are low, it will be difficult to convince the putative challenger to avoid using or acquiring these means. In such cases, the challenger has little to lose even if the chances of success are also low. In contrast, increasing the putative challenger's costs could result in effective deterrence by denial. The deterrer actor does not have to make the undesired activity impossible to achieve but can influence the challenger's calculations by manipulating the costs of developing the undesired activity and executing it. Libicki (2021, 192), for example, asserts that a potential challenger needs to take into account\n\n> the relationship between the resources that must be invested to mount an attack and the resources that are expended to carry out an attack. If the latter are low, then having already decided to make the necessary investments, the decision to use them is likely to be influenced by the prospect of and losses from retaliation—but if the expected costs from retaliation are themselves low, the prospect of failure is likely to be of but modest importance because mounting the attack costs little.\n\nAlthough some scholars acknowledge this aspect of cost—which in fact challenges the clear distinction between deterrence by punishment and deterrence by denial—this insight has only marginally contributed to the (re)conceptualization of deterrence by denial: for example, in systematically considering the various costs the putative challenger may face in light of different strategies of deterrence. In other words, the distinguishing criteria of whether the deterrent threat aims to influence the challengers' perception of costs or of chances of success are not the most effective. For both strategies of deterrence—by punishment and by denial—the costs inflicted or manipulated by the defender have a significant influence on deterrence success.\n\n## Mapping Deterrence Strategies\n\nTo address the challenges discussed in the previous section, I offer a new categorization of deterrence to better conceptualize its diverse types. This categorization is based on two interrelated elements: the means the deterrer uses to threaten the putative challenger and the timing of their use.\n\nFor the first element, I distinguish between two main types of deterrent means: means based on offensive military capability and non-offensive means. Offensive",

Non-offensive means could obviously be defensive measures, but they could also be various other means that limit the damage, limit the challenger's benefits from the damage, prevent the challenger from translating the successful challenge into a meaningful achievement, or (threaten) to cause non-material costs for the putative challenger, such as through de-legitimization, shaming, and stigmatization.\n\nThe second element is the potential timing of the employment of the deterrent measures. Obviously, any measure needs advance preparation, development, and acquirement, as well as communication of its existence to the putative challenger. Nonetheless, a key question is whether the threat is of a measure that will be employed before or after the undesired activity occurs. Some measures are employed mainly in advance, before the unwanted activity takes place, while others are employed after the unwanted activity takes place. While issuing the threatening message occurs before the unwanted activity, it could rely on means that, if needed, will be exercised only after an unwanted activity would occur, for example, retaliation. Thus, the deterrent effect—if successful—is achieved by an opponent's understanding that these means will follow the undesired activity. Conversely, for some other deterrent measures, the deterrent effect is achieved by the putative challenger's understanding that the deterrent means are already exercised, such as in the case of walls or norm building.\n\nBased on this, I distinguish among four types of strategies of deterrence (see table 1).\n\n## Deterrence through Offensive Means Used before the Execution of the Undesired Activity\n\nActors use offensive means in a number of ways prior to the putative unwanted activity in order to deter it.\n\n## Denial Capabilities\n\nActors may threaten to use offensive means prior to the execution of the undesired activity to establish their ability to deny the effect of the potential challenge and thus signal to the putative challenger that it is a worthless endeavor. The idea behind this strategy is not just to physically eliminate the capabilities of the opponent, as evident in defensive strategies, but also to signal to the challenger that allocating resources to this goal is too costly given that the goal may not be accomplished. As Sawyer (2021, 111) argues,\n\n4My categorization is inspired by Wirtz (2021, 127–8), who acknowledges the various ways to attain deterrence thorough retaliation, punishment, and denial and distinguishes among three ways of using offensive means for deterrence by denial: “(1) threats to launch preemptive attack or preventive war to deny the opponent military capability to launch an attack; (2) threats to defeat an attack where and when it occurs…or (3) threats to eliminate the ‘bone of contention’,” thus temporary success will not lead to a political gain. However, there are a number of differences between his discussion and my framework. First, I more directly offer a systematic way to distinguish between the offensive means by putting forward the timing of their use. Second, I contrast these offensive strategies with non-offensive ones as part of the systematic categorization. Lastly, Wirtz limits his discussion to attempts to deter territorial changes.\n\n5My categorization is also inspired by Smith and Talbot (2008, 56–9), who distinguish among different levels of deterrence by denial: tactical, operational, and strategic. These, respectively, concern means used to prevent the act of terrorism, means that aim to prevent terrorist capabilities, and means of preventing the goals the terrorists pursue. As such, their study overlaps with the categorization suggested in this article, as timing plays a significant role in both. Nonetheless, Smith and Talbot’s categorizations also differ considerably from mine. First, Smith and Talbot focus specifically on deterring terrorism, while I use the categorization to explore various unwanted activities. Second, and more importantly, I focus on the timing of the employment of the means the deterrer actor uses, while their classification concerns the timing of the effect of the deterrence strategy. As a result, the offered categorization allows us to better compare deterrence by denial and deterrence by punishment and thus to better grasp these two types of strategies. The suggested categorization also overlaps with Zilincik and Sweijs (2023), who distinguish between different timings—before, during, and after an attack. Nonetheless, not only does their research focus on denial strategies and not on strategies of deterrence, but as a result, they also rely on different timing and consider different categories. Furthermore, their main goal is to examine the emotional effects of different denial strategies.",

However, when it is defined as strategic communication intended to alter perceptions about the availability and acquisition costs for necessary resources ... it too is a case of dissuasion.\n\nThis strategy is evident in threats to make a preventive or preemptive strike in a way that denies the challenger’s military option (Wirtz 2021, 127). The idea is that these strikes will not just physically prevent the challenger’s ability to perform the unwanted action but will also signal that developing such an option is a useless effort.\n\nSome of Israel’s operations can be understood in this context. While Israel has traditionally emphasized the strategy of deterrence by punishment (Adamsky 2017), its offensive capabilities are also used for deterrence by denial (Inbar and Sandler 1993, 322). One example is the destruction in 2007 of a nuclear reactor, secretly built in the Deir ez-Zor region in eastern Syria. While the attack was carried out through a covert airstrike to reduce the chances of an escalation, its details were officially revealed a few years later (Matania and Bachrach 2023, 13–4). Although some scholars, such as Bar (2020, 332), see Israel’s preventive and preemptive strikes as part of establishing deterrence by punishment (and cumulative deterrence), another message is being implicitly delivered: that is, allocating resources to the goals of developing nuclear capabilities will be worthless given Israel’s ability and will to eliminate them in advance (Matania and Bachrach 2023, 21). As a result, they not only deny the challenger’s ability to acquire nuclear capabilities that would challenge Israel, but they also demonstrate the involved costs for the putative challenger to invest in such an allegedly pointless endeavor. In a similar way, the operation that started in late 2018 to destroy the tunnels Hizbullah mined from Southern parts of Lebanon into Israeli territory to invade Israel was not just to eliminate Hizbullah’s capabilities: It also had a deterrent message referring to the heavy costs and resources Hizbullah put into this project, especially given the difficulties of digging in the rocky ground of the Galilee (Matania and Bachrach 2023, 23). While Israel made no prior attempts to deter Hizbullah from establishing these tunnels, the destruction aimed, among other things, to send a deterrent message in order to affect Hizbullah’s future behavior. Again, it should be emphasized that in these cases, the",

For example, while there is some ambiguity regarding whether \"defend forward\" is a strategy of deterrence (by punishment) or a departure from it (Fischerkeller and Harknett 2017; King and Gallagher 2020, 27–8; Whyte 2020, 210), some scholars have interpreted the US reliance on defend forward as a strategy that is based on denial through offensive means (Sweijs and Zilincik 2020, 148). As Borghard and Lonergan (2023) argue, \"Elements of the DoD's concept of defend forward resonate with a deterrence by denial strategy, specifically those aspects that are focused on counter-cyber operations to disrupt, deny, or degrade adversary offensive capabilities and infrastructure.\" The Department of Defense Cyber Strategy (DoD 2018, 1) clearly states, \"We will defend forward to disrupt or halt malicious cyber activity at its source, including activity that falls below the level of armed conflict.\" The deterrent message was described by General Paul Nakasone, Commander of US Cyber Command and Director of the National Security Agency, in the February 2019 Congressional testimony, in which he argued that these efforts could increase the costs of opponents' military actions through \"craft[ing] tools and tactics to frustrate their efforts\" (in Borghard and Lonergan 2023, 561). He echoes the idea that deterrence by denial aims to influence an opponent not just by affecting the putative challenger's estimations of success, but also by increasing the costs of conducting the undesired activity.\n\n## Deterrence through Threatening to Use Offensive Means after the Execution of the Undesired Activity\n\nDeterring threats may also refer—and often do—to threats that will be implemented if the unwanted activity were to occur. In contrast to the first category, which refers to deterrent means that are operated prior to the execution of the unwanted activity, in this category the timing of using the deterrent means is after the execution of the unwanted activity—that is if the unwanted activity has already occurred.\n\n## Deterrence by Retaliation\n\nThis strategy is evident most clearly in cases of deterrence by punishment, where the defender threatens to retaliate—that is the threat is to use offensive means after an unwanted activity occurred—in order to convince a putative challenger to avoid it. The fundamental idea of this strategy is that credibly threatening a putative challenger with a retaliation would lead the challenger to avoid the undesired behavior, at least if the cost of punishment would exceed any potential gain (e.g., George and Smoke 1974; Morgan 2003, 1–25). As noted above, this idea has been widely developed in the context of nuclear deterrence, but it has also shaped strategies based on different offensive means, including, in recent years, cyber deterrence (e.g., in Wilner 2020, 252–4). The idea is that if deterrence works, actors will avoid challenging a deterrer actor because of the costs the retaliation would pose. For this reason, and acknowledging the limited availability of cyber targets that would allow deterrers to impose high costs on putative challengers, actors are advised to retaliate against cyberattacks not only with cyber means but also with traditional military kinetic means (e.g., Kugler 2009, 328; Schneider 2019).\n\n## Denial of Achievements\n\nThreatening to use offensive means after the challenger has executed the unwanted activity could also characterize situations of deterrence by denial (Buzan 1987, 136; Vanaga 2019, 171). Most prominently, this is the idea behind conventional military",

Indeed, as Luttwak (1985, 3) notes, traditionally “the continuous deterrence generated by military force was generally treated as a bonus gain,” and their main goal was winning the war. Nonetheless, acquiring military capabilities had the advantage of not only providing a remedy for cases of an attack (and thus deterrence failure), but also affecting the putative challenger’s calculations about their chances of success. For this reason, Mazarr (2018, 2) argues that a useful way to estimate the effectiveness of deterrence by denial is to examine the “immediate balance of forces in the contested territory.” This clearly emphasizes that the costs the putative challenger may need to pay concern not just situations of deterrence by punishment but also situations of deterrence by denial. Obviously, attacking an opponent capable of defending will increase the costs for a putative challenger, not just because of retaliation but also because of the costs of waging the war, even if the challenger could win it. As Mazarr (2018, 6) notes, “Even if an attacker believes it might be successful in such cases, the costs of a long and painful war are a powerful preventive deterrent.”\n\n## Deterrence through Non-Offensive Means Used before the Execution of the Undesired Activity\n\nNon-offensive means could also be used for deterrent purposes, both prior to and following the execution of the unwanted activity of a challenger. Those used prior to the unwanted activity include a variety of strategies to threaten an opponent, such as de-legitimization, establishing resilience, and passive defense means such as establishing walls. This non-offensive deterrent means by denial work through limiting the potential damage of the undesired activity either by preventing the damage or by preventing the challenger’s ability to translate the undesired activity into meaningful damage. Exercising these means becomes part of the deterrent message the defender issues to the putative challenger.\n\n## De-Legitimization\n\nA number of scholars have pointed to de-legitimization as an effective means of deterrence by denial, especially against terrorism (Gearson 2012, 183). According to Stein Gross and Levi (2015, 417), “[T]he purpose is to manipulate the social rewards of prohibited action.” In their discussion, they rely on Wilner (2011, 26), who asserts, “[T]he objective is to reduce the challenger’s probability of achieving his goals by attacking the legitimacy of the beliefs that inform his behavior.” This strategy aims to influence the putative challenger’s perception of success—their ability to translate an attack into a political victory. Nonetheless, this strategy also relates to costs the putative challenger would pay in three meaningful ways. First, this means of deterrence through de-legitimization is partly based on the political costs the challenger will pay in their domestic arena (see also Wilner 2011, 27). Second, on the top of these costs are the direct costs associated with the means required to prepare and execute the undesired activity. Third, this strategy undermines the ability of the putative challenger to mobilize support, which also affects its available resources. In this respect, this creates costs, prevents gains, and denies its (future) capabilities.⁶\n\nNonetheless, the connections between de-legitimization and deterrence by denial success are complicated. On the one hand, there is some evidence that successful de-legitimization does not necessarily lead to effective deterrence. For example, Turkey successfully delegitimized the PKK (Kurdistan Workers’ Party) in the early 2000s, convincing many Western countries that it is a terror organization. However, while this successful de-legitimization had some effects on the PKK’s ability to mobilize resources and support (e.g., Casier 2010), it also “resulted in recurrence of\n\n⁶According to Stein Gross and Levi (2015, 416–7) and based on criminological research, deterrence by denial through de-legitimization can be based on three different audiences that affect the potential risks and rewards of the terrorists: formal authorities (law enforcement), social bonds, and informal control.",

            "markdown": "old practices, including its default to violence” (Gürcan and Coşar Ünal 2018, 194). Conversely, some scholars have provided evidence to demonstrate terror organization leaders' sensitivity to legitimacy. For example, Knopf considers a message sent by the number two leader of al Qaeda, at the time, Ayman al-Zawahari, to the leader of this organization in Iraq, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, in which Zawahari “instructed Zarqawi that his methods, including indiscriminate attacks on Muslim civilians and the release of videos showing hostage beheadings, were so excessive they had become counterproductive.” According to Zawahiri, ‘the strongest weapon which the mujahadeen enjoys .... is popular support from the Muslim masses ... [meaning] the mujahed movement must avoid any action that the masses do not understand or approve'” (Knopf 2010, 18, ftn, 92).\n\nDe-legitimization is also used to deter threats other than terrorism, such as deterring cyberattacks through the development of norms (Stevens 2012, 159; Nye 2017, 60--2), in this way increasing the costs the challenger would pay with regard to different audiences (Wilner 2020, 255). As Soesanto and Smeets argue, “the creation of norms and rules for state behaviour in cyberspace, will over time translate into a general principle of restraint, raise the reputational costs of bad behaviour” (Soesanto and Smeets 2020, 393).\n\nThis strategy is similarly used to deter attacks in outer space. According to Mckeown and Wilner (2020), one of the means to deter an attack on US satellites is through de-legitimization, which is based on “developing ‘norms of responsible behaviour' in outer space (so as to diplomatically isolate those who would break them)” (Mckeown and Wilner 2020, 401). In fact, some official reports, such as from the US Department of Defense (2014), have pointed to the need to rely on this strategy, recommending the “development of international norms of responsible behavior that enhance safety, security, and stability in space.” According to the report, advancing these norms can have “a positive effect on deterrence; even if potential adversaries are not deterred from conducting hostile or malicious acts in space, norms can help the international community identify and isolate aggressors” (DoD 2014).\n\nThis example thus captures both elements of deterrence by denial and of deterrence by punishment. On the one hand, it concerns the prevention of challengers' ability to translate a successful challenge into a meaningful political achievement. In situations where such norms are strong, domestic and international audiences will prevent the putative challenger from making it a political victory. On the other hand, it also concerns deterrence by punishment, especially since the putative challenger's fear is not just of material costs associated with the punishment, but also of psychological and social costs (Sweijs and Zilincik 2020, 149--50).\n\nThe logic of the nuclear taboo and the emergence of normative limits to the use of nuclear weapons increase the costs of using them and thus create self-deterrence mechanisms that also overlap with both deterrence by denial and deterrence by punishment. As Tannenwald argues, while taboos affect behavior in a number of ways, some of them rely on a deterrent effect achieved by increasing domestic and international public opinion costs (Tannenwald 2007, 48--9; see also Nye 2017, 60). According to her, the norm of the taboo has not only had a significant and direct impact on the avoidance of using nuclear weapons over the years, but it has also enhanced nuclear deterrence, and thus increased the costs decision-makers would pay if they used nuclear weapons in a first strike (Tannenwald 2007, 45). In this respect, policymakers' awareness of the norm, according to Tannenwald (2007), has dissuaded them from using these weapons.\n\n### Establishing Resilience\n\nThe demonstration of resilience is another way actors can exercise deterrence by denial with non-offensive measures prior to the execution of the undesired activity.",

Resilience can be used in various contexts in multiple domains of competition and vis-à-vis different kinds of challenging actors: state and non-state (Sweijs and Zilincik 2020, 148). In addition, it can be employed with different means. For example, resilience can be achieved through technological solutions, such as backup and recovery systems in case of cyberattacks (Nye 2017, 56). Actors can also rely on developing procedures and routines to better prepare for absorbing undesired activities such as terror attacks, for example, by educating the public about such situations. Gearson (2012, 191) suggests that “[b]y demonstrating that a society is resilient and well prepared for dislocations and shock, with intelligent design and disaster recovery procedures embedded into government and private sector behaviour, the target communities will also be reassured and confident of recovery.” Furthermore, effective use of resilience mechanisms may create substantial costs for the putative challenger, implying that investing efforts in targeting the defender is not a wise decision for allocating resources. As Nye (2017, 56) suggests regarding these means, “Attackers have limited resources and time; therefore, driving up the costs can deter attacks.”\n\n### Defensive Means\n\nStrategies of deterrence by denial also rely on defensive means that could be used or employed before the execution of the undesired activity (e.g. Goldgeier and Wojtowicz. 2022, 5), including walls and fortifications. Cioffi-Revilla (1999), for example, uses archeological evidence from different regions to demonstrate that deterrence by denial was used thousands of years ago. According to him, massive walls “signal significant material capacity and likely organizational know-how to implement deterrence by denial” (Cioffi-Revilla 1999, 247). These walls are also used in modern times with varying degrees of success, including against armies and terror attacks (Naroll et al. 1974, Brantly 2018, 35) and even against migrants (Kent et al. 2020, 856, 864). The intention in these cases is to deter by signaling to individuals and armies that they will not be able to achieve their desired goals or that they will need to invest substantial resources toward it. Findings from migration scholarship show that while walls decrease the number of people who cross these specific areas, the numbers often increase in other areas (Kent et al. 2020, 871). This echoes the point about the interrelated effects of the costs and chances of success in executing an action a deterrer actor attempts to prevent. Lastly, passive defense measures like “civil defense” are also based on non-military means that serve deterrence by denial, such as using shelters or evacuating populations in certain scenarios. These measures are used prior to the occurrence of the unwanted activity (Freedman 2004, 37). While such measures can also be costly for the defender, they significantly limit the potential gain a putative challenger can make from executing the unwanted activity, and thus may decrease its attractiveness.\n\nSome cyber defensive measures may seem similar to traditional security means: for example, (fire-)walls, which are used to harden cyber targets and defend against cyberattacks and thus could have deterrent effect (Nye 2017, 56). Cyber technologies provide some other unique ways to use this type of strategy, for example, by remodeling the cyber terrain. This may enhance cyber defense and thus has deterrence by denial effects (Matania and Tal-Shir 2020, 292).\n\n### Spoofing\n\nPlanting dummy targets makes the execution of the unwanted activity more costly and thus can be used as a strategy of deterrence by denial. The rationale is that planting dummy targets increases the potential future efforts and costs the putative challengers need to invest since resources have to be allocated to identify the real",

According to Gutman and Rojkes Dombe (2017), defenders may exercise this strategy through electronic means that signal locations of alleged vessels that do not really exist. As they note, “planting hundreds of military dummy targets, through the AIS [Automatic Identification System] protocol, into the status picture of defending side’s coastal layout” creates a deterrence by denial effect, dissuading an opponent from going out to sea to begin with (Gutman and Rojkes Dombe 2017). While powerful actors, such as the United States, may have resources and various capabilities that allow them to exactly trace the location of vessels—such as through intelligence, reconnaissance, and surveillance assets (e.g., Mirski 2013, 406)—not all putative challengers have access to these capabilities.\n\nAnother example is the music industry’s attempt in the early 2000s to deter the sharing of media files through streaming services such as Napster. Various measures were used to complicate access to these files and thus to deter potential users (Pesta 2004, 406–10; Jennings and Bossler 2020). Spoofing was one of these methods, where copyright holders uploaded corrupted files, including fake music files, that provided computer users with “static, popping, cracking noises, or silence instead of the unauthorized music file they were attempting to download” (Pesta 2004, 408–9). The industry even hired some companies to distribute these fake files (Segal 2002). The explicit aim of these attempts was to create a deterrent effect: Given the time and costs of downloading files in the early 2000s, the attractiveness of this activity was lessened by actors’ knowledge that there was a good chance the file would be corrupted. In the end, the deterrent effect was aimed to be achieved by reducing the likelihood of success of downloading the media files. Nonetheless, the strategy also emphasizes the importance of “costs” for deterrence by denial. If there were no costs to downloading the music—internet costs, time invested in searching for the files, the annoyance of downloading a corrupted file—then there would be no deterrent effect. Interestingly, as Jennings and Bossler (2020, 1038–9) note, this strategy had little deterrent effect because the corrupted files were identified and so users could avoid them.\n\n## Deterrence through Threatening to Use Non-Offensive Means after the Execution of the Undesired Activity\n\nLastly, actors could threaten to use non-offensive measures after absorbing the undesired activity. Most commonly, this could be done through threatening to use defensive measures to deny the effectiveness of the challenge, for example, thorough “anti-aircraft or anti-ballistic missile systems designed to bring down the enemy offensive before any targets were reached” (Freedman 2004, 37). Clearly, the defender needs to have these capabilities as well as to communicate them to the putative challenger to dissuade the unwanted action (see also Golov 2016, 89).\n\nAn effective deterrence by denial carries the message that preparing and executing the challenge would be costly because the resources allocated would not be worth it. As Sawyer (2021, 111) notes, “Tactical denial—communication about target-hardening efforts—conveys the adversary that it must adopt new tactics, which are likely to increase the cost or uncertainty of action in the short term.” Denial could be established on defensive components in such a way that “an adver\n\n7Scholars have pointed to a number of challenges concerning this strategy: for example, the limited credibility of reliance on defensive systems for deterrence, especially given the limited “margin of error” (Freedman 2004, 37), their costs (Adamsky 2021, 184), the challenges they create for deterrence by punishment (Adamsky 2021, 185), and the incentives they may give to a putative challenger in order to exhaust the defensive systems budget (Brantly 2018, 36). For a review of strategic negative implications of defensive systems on deterrence, see Quackenbush (2006, 533), who nonetheless contends that these systems eventually enhance deterrence success (Quackenbush 2006, but see Golov 2016).",

This view is part of how Katagiri (2021), who focuses on deterrence through defensive means, defines deterrence by denial. According to him, it is the “ability to deny actions and persuade the opponent that it is unlikely to attain its immediate objectives at a reasonable cost” (Katagiri 2021, 203, my emphasis). This means that defensive measures may increase the costs for a putative challenger to execute the attack and thus, as in deterrence by punishment, may affect not only their chance of success but also their costs of planning, developing, and executing the challenge.\n\nTo take a more concrete example, Israel in recent years has shifted its strategy, relying increasingly on active defense systems to cover various types of threats, including the Iron Dome missile defense batteries that aim to intercept short-range rockets and the Arrow system that aims to intercept long-range missiles. Although skeptical about how effective these defensive measures are in creating successful deterrence, Adamsky (2021, 178--81) acknowledges that the changes in the strategic environment “produced a much stronger emphasis on defense in Israeli national security, and thus somewhat expanded the role of deterrence by denial in Israel strategic thought.”\n\nActive defense systems are also used for deterrence by denial strategies to dissuade cyberattacks. While the question remains as to whether these defensive systems could effectively provide defense or deterrence by denial, a number of scholars suggest this at least as a theoretical option (Borghard and Lonergan 2023, 534-5). Schneider (2019, 113), for example, argues that “cyber defense” could be achieved through “securing nodes of civilian and military networks” such as space-based satellites and optic cables. The point, however, is that while cyber infrastructures could be defended with passive means, they could also be defended by active defense measures, including kinetic means such as ballistic missiles, as part of a cross-domain deterrence.\n\nHowever, non-offensive means do not necessarily need to be military ones. For example, policies of deterrence to prevent immigration rely on means used after the perceived unwanted activity occurs such as detaining immigrants, preventing social benefits and work rights, and reducing access to legal due process (Kent et al. 2020, 856). All these means are characterized by being employed after the unwanted action has taken place—the immigrants have already entered a country whose government aims to deter immigration. The idea behind these deterrent policies is to demonstrate to potential immigrants that they will not be able to succeed: for example, they will be unable to work in the target country. This negates the value of the costs invested in the immigration process and in the efforts to immigrate into their territories.\n\n## Toward a Revised Theory of Deterrence by Denial\n\nThe discussion so far demonstrates that while deterrence by punishment and deterrence by denial can be contrasted if we consider them through their strategic goals, overlaps can be seen by looking at the strategies' means as well as their timing. For example, both deterrence by denial and deterrence by punishment could be established by using offensive means, even those used after the execution of the challenge. The discussion also shows that inflicting costs is a significant element not only of deterrence by punishment but also of deterrence by denial. The strategy of deterrence by denial involves mechanisms that can increase the costs for the putative challenger, including costs associated with resources to prepare for and conduct the undesired activity. Some strategies of deterrence by denial concern other",

Taking these elements together, and acknowledging the overlap between deterrence by punishment and deterrence by denial, opens a path to further theorize deterrence by denial. Furthermore, acknowledging the overlap may lead a more general theory of deterrence to account for both types of deterrence.\n\nWhile it is beyond the scope of this article to cover all the factors accounting for the success of deterrence by denial, taking steps toward this goal could prove useful to demonstrate the advantages of the suggested conceptualization when it comes to explaining deterrence success and considering the adoption of the strategy.\n\n### Deterrence Success—The Balance of Costs\n\nAs demonstrated above, different means of both deterrence by punishment and deterrence by denial may incur costs in various ways for putative challengers. It follows then that a key concept in accounting for deterrence success (of deterrence by either punishment or denial) is the balance of costs. When the costs to the putative challenger of executing the challenge are low—because the cost of expected retaliation is low, because the costs of the means for the attack are low, because the costs of executing the attack are low, and/or because the domestic audience supports paying these costs—the challenge will be much more difficult to successfully deter. Similarly, when acquiring or using the means of deterrence is costly for the defender, it is difficult to threaten using them as deterrents (see also Matania and Bachrach 2023).\n\nThis was exactly the situation with Israel's reliance on defensive measures to deter Hamas rockets launched from Gaza using the Iron Dome system. The costs for Hamas were between 500 and 1,000 US dollars per Katyusha rocket, while each intercepting missile costs 50,000 and a battery of Iron Dome costs around 100 million US dollars (Brantly 2018, 36). Although the costs for Israel in a situation without any defensive measures might be much higher given the potential damage these rockets can do, this system's deterrent effect in preventing these attacks is very limited. In fact, some have pointed out that these unbalanced costs may incentivize Hamas to challenge Israel to erode its security budget. This is why former Israeli Prime Minister, Naftali Bennet (2022), declared that Israel is developing a defense system based on laser technology: To change “[t]he economic equation ... If it is possible to intercept a missile or rocket with just an electric pulse that costs a few dollars, we will have nullified the ring of fire that Iran has set up on our borders. The whole thing no longer pays off.”\n\nIn contrast, in other cases, the deterrer actors may be the ones who enjoy the “balance of costs.” An interesting example is provided by Lior Div, the CEO of Cybereason, a cyber security company. Although he does not refer to the concept of deterrence by denial, he clearly demonstrates this logic when discussing the SolarWinds attack. This was a serious cyberattack, likely sponsored by a foreign government, that infected numerous computers in the United States in late 2020, including nine government agencies and a hundred private companies. In an interview, Div noted that “SolarWinds attackers scanned networks to determine if Cybereason's software was installed. If they saw that it was present, they bypassed it and moved along to another network” (Levy 2021). Given the system's past successes, the hackers did not want it to gather information on their malicious code. This is an example of deterrence by denial based on the challenger's fear that the system could effectively detect and neutralize the attack and thus render the efforts invested in the malicious code useless. More generally, while not entirely deterring the use of this attack and not using fear of retaliation, the Cybereason system effectively deterred by denial the attack on the computers on which it operated.",

            "markdown": "Another important factor affecting the balance of costs, and thus deterrence success, is the cost for the putative challenger of identifying relevant targets and knowing how costly it would be to execute the challenge: for example, in case of defensive missiles, how costly it would be for a putative challenger to identify areas the system cannot fully cover, or, similarly, in the case of building walls, how costly (how many resources it would take) it would be for immigrants to identify alternative routes to those blocked by walls. It could be that these latter costs are not high, as evidence shows that while walls have a deterrent effect, the number of those crossing in areas without walls increases (Kent et al. 2020, 871). Another example is in the case of spoofing. As noted above, the costs of identifying the fake media files were very low (Jennings and Bossler 2020, 1038--9), which led to deterrence failure. Nonetheless, planting dummy targets at sea seems a much more effective strategy given that many actors do not have access to measures that allow them to identify the real targets, thus significantly increasing their costs to distinguish between real and faked ones (Gutman and Rojkes Dombe 2017).\n\nThe cost of knowing is also affected by another factor; that is, the costs to execute the activity the defender aims to prevent. When the costs to execute the unwanted activity are very low, the costs of knowing become less important, since a putative challenger may easily challenge many possible targets. For example, as noted above, when the cost for launching rockets is low, as in the case of the rockets Hamas launches against Israel (Brantly 2018, 36), putative challengers do not need to invest many resources into identifying alternative targets, thus indicating the limited effectiveness of deterrence by denial.\n\nThe costs of knowing are also relevant for deterrence by punishment. In some cases, deterrer actors, indeed, clearly state what the costs would be for executing the unwanted behavior and what would be considered as such a behavior. Nonetheless, in many other cases, the deterrent threat includes ambiguities (see Crawford 2003, 11--2) that force the putative challenger to invest resources in identifying the structure of costs. In terms of the balance of costs, this adds another layer and trade-off of costs affecting deterrence success.\n\nLastly, the balance of costs may also be affected by different mechanisms and means operated at different times. This is because a deterrent means may incur additional costs at times other than when they are exercised. Acknowledging the different categories presented above, which refer to different timings at which the deterrent means are exercised, may thus point to other ways to enhance the deterrent threat. For example, as discussed above, building norms is a non-offensive deterrent means used prior to the execution of the unwanted activity. Its effectiveness stems from policymakers' sensitivity to the domestic and international public opinion costs, and thus on their ability to translate the unwanted activity into a meaningful political achievement. However, while normative structures create a pre-condition for deterrence success, the deterrent effect may be enhanced by other mechanisms that could be exercised if an unwanted activity takes place, such as naming and shaming. Breaking norms inflict “a kind of social punishment on the normative transgressor. A loss of face amongst the international community is the likely outcome of such a naming and shaming exercise” (Ryan 2018, 337). In other words, naming and shaming practices allow an actor to translate the norm into a specific deterrent threat, and thus to incur more concrete costs (Schulz 2015, 41). Conversely, decision-makers who know that no one would translate the inappropriate behavior into costs would be less affected by the norm.\n\nFurthermore, these dynamics could also have future deterrent effects, even if they failed. In this respect, although exercising naming and shaming demonstrates deterrence failure, as neither the norm nor the possibility of naming and shaming dissuaded the unwanted activity, it may clarify the potential costs for future similar behavior. In addition, practicing naming and shaming may help mobilize opponents to this behavior, resulting in a future increase in the costs of the unwanted activity.",

The discussion above emphasizes not only the strategies the deterrer actor uses but also the means and timing. This provides a useful point of departure for asking questions about the reliance on deterrence strategies in general or about the exact type of deterrence, as well as about the specific means used for deterrence purposes. For example, cultural elements may explain actors’ reliance on non-offensive measures for deterrence. The case of Japan, given its culture and constitutional restrictions, is a key example of an actor that relies on deterrence by denial through defensive systems (Katagiri 2021). As Katagiri (2021, 207) explains, in addition to extended deterrence it receives, Japan’s doctrine is based on “defensive defence, which bans offensive use of force even in wartime. It means that defensive force can only be used in the event of a foreign attack and is limited to the minimum necessary for self-defence. Since the 1970s it has informed Japan’s deterrence-by-denial posture and affected weapons programs and operations.”\n\nIn a similar way, cultural and social elements may explain a state’s reliance on strategies of deterrence by punishment or deterrence by denial that mainly use offensive measures. For Israel, for example, reliance on the actual use of force as part of practicing deterrence, and especially cumulative deterrence, is a formative idea (Bar-Joseph 1998, 156–7; Almog 2004–5; Bar 2020, 324–5, 330–1). It is related not only to strategic elements, but also to cultural, social, and political ones (Sucharov 2005, 31, 68; Barnett 2013, 37–47; Lupovici 2016, 54). From this perspective, it matters little whether the strategy relies on deterrence by punishment or deterrence by denial. Rather, the important elements are the means used and the ability to employ them as part of a strategy of deterrence.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn this article, I offered a new way to distinguish among different types of deterrence strategies based on the means used for deterrent threats and the timing of when actors threaten to use them. I demonstrated each of the various types by considering examples from kinetic and cyber domains. I argue that using this categorization better captures the differences and overlapping of deterrence by punishment and deterrence by denial. In addition, viewing deterrence through these lenses also emphasizes that inflicting costs is a key aspect not only of deterrence by punishment but also of deterrence by denial.\n\nExploring these issues helps us to further theorize about deterrence by denial, whose study currently lags behind the research on deterrence by punishment. While this paper acknowledges this gap, it also offers and demonstrates a direction to close it by contextualizing the means deterrer actors use and recognizing that costs are an aspect common to both types of deterrence.\n\nI conclude by pointing to a broader research agenda derived from this research. First, this discussion helps us to reconsider how factors already acknowledged in deterrence scholarship may have different effects on the categories presented above. For example, scholars acknowledge the importance of communicating capabilities and intentions. Means used before defenders experience the challenge—either defensively or offensively—may communicate the threat more effectively than those employed only post-factum, as, for example, in the case of traditional deterrence",

Second, and along with the previous point, this research allows us to consider, categorize, and explain different strategies of deterrence. For example, in recent years scholars have pointed to the strategy of threatening to reveal the identity of a putative challenger through the notion of deterrence by detection or by accusation (e.g., Lindsay and Gartzke 2018, 192; Finnemore and Hollis 2020, 980–1; Wilner 2020, 271). The framework suggested here would locate this strategy as a non-offensive means operated after the execution of the undesired action: for example, technological means will help to identify post-factum who committed the attack, but communicating this capability in advance could have a deterrent effect. Considering this strategy in this category allows us to develop specific factors to account for its failure or success and help us to better contrast it with other strategies of deterrence.\n\nAlso important in further developing explanations of deterrence success, as discussed above, is to focus on costs or the balance of costs. Again, one set of questions concerns how costs—and not just costs of a retaliatory strike—could be communicated, including communicating both the ability to inflict costs and the intention to use these capabilities. Furthermore, distinguishing among different types of costs inflicted at different points of time is also a promising direction for theorizing deterrence success, including that of deterrence by denial.\n\nThis categorization inspires additional questions about the adoption of the strategy. For example, scholars could explore whether actors prioritize some means for deterrent purposes over others, such as in the Japanese and Israeli cases briefly discussed above. Scholars could also ask more specific questions about key concepts, such as the cult of reputation (Tang 2005). For example, they could compare the effects of this cult on actors’ reliance on offensive and non-offensive means when they consider adopting or issuing a deterrent threat.\n\nFinally, on an empirical level, this framework offers a useful direction to explore cyber deterrence further. As noted above, while deterrence by denial seems a more effective strategy to address cyber security concerns, such research requires further theoretical development (e.g., Borghard and Lonergan 2023, 534-5). My research addresses this challenge by offering specific directions to explore cyber deterrence success (and its adoption). For example, the emphasis of this conceptual framework on “costs” is pertinent to exploring cyber security given the various costs involved for both the defender and the putative challenger. Likewise, cyber technologies could spark interesting debates on the distinction between offensive and non-offensive means both in thinking about deterrence success and in studying the adoption of the strategy. This is especially important given questions about what counts as offensive or violent means in the cyber domain, and thus what legitimizes a response and with what means (Lupovici 2019, 181).\n\n## References\n\nADAMSKY, DMITRY. 2017. “From Israel with Deterrence: Strategic Culture, Intra-War Coercion and Brute Force.” *Security Studies* 26(1): 157–84.\n———. 2021. “Deterrence by Denial in Israeli Strategic Thinking.” In *Deterrence by Denial: Theory and Practice*, edited by Alex S.

Despite its prominence, however, the scholarship on deterrence by denial stands to be developed further. It lags behind scholarship on deterrence by punishment on two points: in identifying the conditions under which the strategy works and in examining elements affecting its adoption. Deterrence by denial also carries some conceptual ambiguity since its employment takes many significantly different forms and also because it overlaps with deterrence by punishment. Despite the emphasis in current scholarship on \"inflicting costs\" as a defining element of deterrence by punishment, costs arguably also play a significant role in deterrence by denial. To address these challenges, I distinguish between deterrence strategies by focusing on two main elements: the means the deterrer actor threatens to use (offensive or non-offensive) and the timing of the threatened use of these means (before or after the unwanted activity). This offers a more nuanced distinction between deterrence strategies and better encompasses the role of inflicting costs in deterrence by denial. I suggest that this research offers a useful point of departure to further theorize about deterrence by denial, and it sets a promising research agenda that is pertinent given the growing interest in deterrence by denial, especially in its application to cyber deterrence.\nLa estrategia de disuasión por negación es ampliamente utilizada por diferentes agentes.

La disuasión por negación también conlleva cierta ambigüedad conceptual, ya que se utiliza de muchas formas, significativamente diferentes entre ellas, y también porque se solapa con la disuasión por castigo. A pesar del énfasis existente en el mundo académico actual en usar el hecho de «imponer costes» como un elemento definitorio de la disuasión por castigo, estos costes también juegan un papel importante en la disuasión por negación.

Esto nos ofrece una distinción más matizada entre ambas estrategias de disuasión y engloba de una mejor forma el papel que juega el hecho de imponer costes dentro de la disuasión por negación. Sugerimos que esta investigación ofrece un punto de partida útil para teorizar de forma más profunda sobre la disuasión por negación, y establece una agenda de investigación prometedora, la cual resulta relevante debido al creciente interés en materia de la disuasión por negación, especialmente en su aplicación a la disuasión cibernética.\nLa stratégie de dissuasion par le déni est largement employée par divers acteurs. Néanmoins, malgré son importance, elle ne fait l'objet que de peu de travaux de recherche. Elle a du retard par rapport à la recherche sur la dissuasion par la punition à deux niveaux : quand il s'agit d'identifier les conditions de fonctionnement d'une stratégie et quand il s'agit d'analyser les éléments qui ont une incidence sur son adoption. La dissuasion par le déni s'accompagne également d'une certaine ambiguïté conceptuelle, car son emploi revêt des formes très différentes et elle a tendance à recouper la dissuasion par la punition. Malgré l'accent actuel des recherches sur les « coûts infligés » comme élément définitoire de la dissuasion par la punition, ceux-ci pourraient bien aussi jouer un rôle important dans la dissuasion par le déni. Pour répondre à ces défis, je distingue les stratégies de dissuasion en me concentrant sur deux éléments principaux : les moyens que l'acteur dissuasif menace d'utiliser (offensifs ou non) et la temporalité d'application de cette menace (avant ou après l'activité indésirable). Ainsi apparaît une distinction plus nuancée des stratégies de dissuasion, qui représente plus justement le rôle des coûts infligés dans la dissuasion par le déni. Selon moi, ce travail de recherche propose un point de départ utile quand il s'agit de pousser la théorisation de la dissuasion par le déni et un programme de recherche prometteur et pertinent, étant donné l'intérêt croissant pour la dissuasion par le déni, en particulier pour son application de cyberdissuasion.\nKeywords: deterrence, deterrence by denial\nPalabras clave: disuasión, disuasión por negación\nMots clés: dissuasion, dissuasion par le déni\n# Introduction\nA key classical distinction in deterrence scholarship is between deterrence by punishment and deterrence by denial. Suggested as early as the late 1950s, this distinction in its original formulation focuses on whether the deterrent threat emphasizes the cost for the putative challengers if they execute the undesired activity (deterrence by punishment) or puts into question the challenger's ability to achieve its goals (deterrence by denial) (Snyder 1959). As Wilner and Wenger (2021, 7) explain, \"[W]hereas punishment manipulates behavior by augmenting costs, denial works by stripping away benefits ... so whereas punishment deters through the fear of pain, denial deters through the fear of failure.\" This distinction has been important for the emergence of deterrence research. Given the prominence of nuclear deterrence and its impact on this research, the concept of deterrence by punishment is conspicuous in how the study emerged (Morgan 2021, 18).\nIt is only in recent years that the concept of deterrence by denial has started to attract greater attention (e.g., Smith and Talbot 2008; Gearson 2012; Brantly 2018; Adamsky 2021; Wenger and Wilner 2021; Zilincik and Swejs 2023; Borghard and Lonergan 2023). This shift is due mainly to changes in the threat environment—the advancement of new regional and global powers on the one hand, and the grow\ning role of low-level conflicts, including terrorism and cyber conflicts, on the other (Wilner and Wenger 2021, 4--5). These changes have clarified the need for alternatives to the dominant strategy of deterrence by punishment. For example, some studies have suggested cyber deterrence by denial as an alternative because of the challenges of successfully implementing cyber deterrence by punishment (Iasiello 2013; Nye 2017, 56--57; Libicki 2021), mainly the problem of attribution (Nye 2017, 56; Schneider 2019, 112; Morgan 2021, 17). In addition, organizational competencies and technological developments, such as the advancement of better defensive measures enhance the attractiveness of the strategy of deterrence by denial (e.g. Slayton 2017, 89--90; Lilli 2021, 171; Lupovici 2021, 1687).\nI argue, however, that despite the advantages of the concept of deterrence by denial, it can be further developed theoretically and clarified conceptually. Foremost, while there is a consensus among scholars regarding key factors affecting the success of deterrence by punishment, that is, capability, credibility, and communication (e.g. Morgan 2003, 15--20), much less has been theorized about the conditions under which deterrence by denial succeeds. Likewise, the research could also be developed with regard to studying the adoption of deterrence by denial. For example, while some studies have focused on the social and cultural elements affecting the adoption of deterrence by punishment (Knopf 2013; Lupovici 2016; Adamsky 2017, 166--71), we know much less in this regard about the adoption of deterrence by denial strategies (but see Målksoo2021).\nSecond, deterrence by denial refers to various distinct mechanisms—such as defense, resilience, denial, and prevention—grouped under one category. This ambiguity not only reveals the need to clarify and map the sub-categories of deterrence by denial, but it also aggravates the challenge in studying the success of deterrence by denial—that is, in determining whether each sub-category of deterrence by denial is successful under the same conditions. In addition, and even more challenging, is the overlap between deterrence by punishment and deterrence by denial. As I discuss below, contrary to common wisdom that emphasizes the clear distinction between deterrence by punishment and deterrence by denial, both strategies concern the sensitivity of the putative challenger to “costs.” In other words, while I agree that deterrence by denial focuses on the fear of failure, this strategy is also affected by the manipulation of actors' sensitivity to “costs.” Therefore, inflicting “costs,” while considered a key element of deterrence by punishment, provides a limited borderline between deterrence by punishment and deterrence by denial since it plays a significant role in both kinds of deterrence. Some scholars have put this idea forward: for example, Brantly (2018, 35) clearly argues that both “[d]eterrence by punishment and denial are intended to manipulate the cost-benefit analysis of an adversary.” Likewise, a number of scholars have acknowledged the importance of incurring costs for deterrence by denial (e.g. Gross Stein and Levi 2015, 411; Nye 2017, 56; Mazarr 2018, 6; Libicki 2021, 192; Sawyer 2021, 111; Matania and Bachrach 2023; Zilincik and Sweijs 2023, 261). However, rather than seeing this finding as an obstacle, I argue it is an opportunity not only to clarify this strategy but also to develop a more extensive concept of deterrence in general as well as of deterrence by denial specifically.\nTo achieve this goal, I offer a new conceptualization of deterrence based on two elements: the means used by the deterrer actor to threaten (offensive or non-offensive) and the timing of the threatened use of these means (before or after the unwanted activity occurs). This theoretical move provides a way to clarify the concept of deterrence by denial and a better way to distinguish among different types of deterrence strategies, including by punishment and by denial, and thus avoids the binary distinction between them. Furthermore, this move offers a useful point of departure to advance the research of deterrence by denial success, which lags behind the research of deterrence by punishment success (Gross Stein and Levi 2015, 411; Wilner and Wenger 2021, 7; Zilincik and Sweijs 2023, 249). For example, if we\nDeterrence through Inflicting Costs\nacknowledge that deterrence by punishment and deterrence by denial overlap (i.e., they both concern inflicting costs), we can better rely on the existing scholarship of deterrence by punishment and draw important insights from it concerning both the success and the adoption of deterrence by denial. As a result, while it is beyond the scope of this paper to fully explore deterrence success, I do aim to demonstrate the advantages of the suggested conceptualization toward this goal.\nThe article unfolds as follows. In the first section, I identify a few issues on which the research of deterrence by denial could be further developed. In the second, I suggest the new conceptualization of deterrence, based on the distinction among four different categories, and illustrate them through kinetic and cyber deterrence practices. In the third section, I consider the advantages of this conceptualization regarding the main challenges of the study of deterrence by denial. I conclude by discussing further implications for deterrence scholarship.\n## The Concept of Deterrence by Denial and its Limitations\nI argue that the concept of deterrence by denial could be developed further in two interrelated ways: by elaborating on the conditions under which it succeeds and is adopted and by addressing its conceptual ambiguity.\n## The Need for Further Development of Theoretical Explanations for Deterrence by Denial\n### Deterrence Success\nIn contrast to the rich scholarship of deterrence by punishment, much less is known about the conditions under which the strategy of deterrence by denial works. Scholars agree that the conditions needed for deterrence by punishment are based on defenders' capabilities, credibility, and communication (Morgan 2003, 15-20); however, no such clear articulation of the conditions for deterrence by denial exists. For example, we do not fully know whether the traditional conditions for success of deterrence by punishment are relevant to deterrence by denial or whether we need to consider other conditions, nor do we know how actors deliver their threats in deterrence by denial strategies. While researchers have recently started to engage more specifically with these types of questions (Gearson 2012, 188; Schneider 2019, 113-4; Libicki 2021, 196, 198; Wilner 2021, 54), the scholarship still requires more comprehensive theoretical discussion and empirical studies of these conditions. What we currently have are specific assertions about particular factors that might affect deterrence success, for example, from scholars who study conventional deterrence and focus on deterrence by denial based on military capabilities (e.g., Mearsheimer 1983, 24-30, 62-6). However, as I will further discuss below, deterrence by denial does not rely exclusively on offensive capabilities or on military means in general.\n### Deterrence Adoption\nTheories of deterrence by denial could also be developed through studies elaborating on how and when actors adopt this strategy (Lupovici 2021, 1687). Most deterrence scholars focus on deterrence success rather than on its adoption. As Lupovici (2021) points out, diverting the focus to the adoption of the strategy might be useful, especially when details about deterrence success are limited or difficult to attain. Scholars have already started to explore two main elements that affect the adoption of the strategy: technological changes and cultural and social elements.\n1. Scholars have noted that its implementation in specific contexts could also be further developed. For example, despite the growing interest in studying deterrence by denial in the cyber domain, Borghard and Lonergan (2023, 534-5) conclude that the scholarship's “lack of systematic assessment of how traditional denial concepts, especially those developed in the conventional deterrence literature, could be extended to cyberspace.”\n2. Mearsheimer’s book on conventional deterrence focuses on situations of “denying an aggressor his battlefield objectives with conventional forces” (1983, 15, my emphasis).\nAMIR LUPOVICI\nHowever, these studies have mainly been in the context of deterrence by punishment. For example, some scholars have pointed to how technological changes eased the development and adoption of deterrence by punishment during the Cold War (Kratochwil 1978, 155–6; Cranesale et al. 1983, 30–2; Kaplan 1991, 111; Gundersen 1994, 295). In a similar way, scholars have shown how social elements such as culture, identity, and routines shape the adoption and implementation of practices of deterrence by punishment in different contexts (Basrur 2006, 49–79; Knopf 2013; Lupovici 2016; Adamsky 2017, 166–71). However, similar questions could be asked about deterrence by denial (e.g., Målksoo 2021): for example, whether deterrence by denial allows actors to maintain their prestige and status in the same manner as deterrence through punishment and retaliation.\n## Conceptual Ambiguity\nThe challenge of conceptual ambiguity arises from the various kinds of means of employing the strategy of deterrence by denial and from the difficulty of clearly distinguishing between deterrence by denial and deterrence by punishment.\n## Multiple Strategies\nWhile scholars who explored deterrence by denial originally tended to regard it as based primarily on defensive measures (e.g., Buzan 1987, 135), recent studies agree that deterrence by denial can be achieved in various ways (Zilincik and Sweijs 2023). As Borghard and Lonergan (2023, 541) argue, “While defense can be one mechanism that contributes to deterrence by denial, it is not the only—or even primary—means of achieving denial.” More recent scholarship has also pointed to different means to practice deterrence by denial, such as de-legitimization (Gearson 2012, 183; Stein Gross and Levi 2015, 416), resilience (Nye 2017, 56; Libicki 2021, 205), and law enforcement activities (Borghard and Lonergan 2023, 553); as well as long-term effects based on repeated failures at both strategic and tactical levels (Tor 2017, 108; Wilner 2021, 50–1).\nAlthough it is important to acknowledge the different means through which actors can operate deterrence by denial, a more comprehensive framework would provide a systematic way to categorize the various types of deterrence and thus to effectively compare and contrast among strategies of deterrence by denial and deterrence by punishment. This would also be important given the need to elucidate the conditions under which this strategy works (or is adopted). In other words, it would help to show whether different conditions are necessary for success for different sub-categories of deterrence by denial.\n## Overlap of “Costs”\nAs Wilner and Wenger (2021, 7) observe, scholars suggest that the effect of deterrence by punishment is achieved by fear of retaliation, and the deterrent effect of deterrence by denial is achieved by fear of failure (see also von Hlatky 2015, 4). While they aptly summarize the scholarship, I suggest that the distinction between deterrence by punishment and deterrence by denial is not as clear as many scholars assume.\nFirst, as Buzan (1987, 135), for example, has noted, “[I]n military terms, denial and defense have virtually identical meanings. Those who treat deterrence and defence as alternatives are assuming that deterrence is likewise synonymous with retaliation.” According to Buzan (1987, 136), since the purpose of deterrence is to prevent “unwanted actions before they occur... [L]ogically, therefore the concept of deterrence encompasses both denial and retaliation” (italics in original).\n3 While Buzan (1987) is correct to suggest that defense and denial are both methods of deterrence, along with the threat of punishment (retaliation), it should also be noted that Buzan limits his discussion to military strategies. This is\nHowever, the concern runs even deeper. The question is not whether punishment, denial, and defense should or could be seen as different methods of deterrence. Rather, what is in question is the attempt to fully distinguish between deterrence by punishment and deterrence by denial through the distinction between emphasizing costs for the putative challenger (deterrence by punishment) and emphasizing the challenger's ability to attain its goal (deterrence by denial).\nWhile fear—of failure and of inability to achieve a goal—is a constitutive element of deterrence by denial, it is only part of the deterrent mechanism. It can be suggested that “costs” also play an important role in the practices of deterrence by denial. While certain scholars do acknowledge this argument (e.g. Nye 2017, 56; Brantly 2018, 35; Mazarr 2018, 6; Sawyer 2021, 111; Matania and Bachrach 2023), some see it as being of limited importance. Gross Stein and Levi (2015, 411), for example, argue that the tactics of deterrence by denial “play principally on increasing the likelihood of failure, and only indirectly on cost.”\nThe point, however, is that effective deterrence may be attained by making it clear to the putative challengers that executing the undesired activity will be costly not because of retaliation but rather because of the costs involved in executing it. These are the potential costs the putative challenger would have to invest to acquire the means and carry out the unwanted action. When the costs associated with an activity the defender tries to prevent are low, it will be difficult to convince the putative challenger to avoid using or acquiring these means. In such cases, the challenger has little to lose even if the chances of success are also low. In contrast, increasing the putative challenger's costs could result in effective deterrence by denial. The deterrer actor does not have to make the undesired activity impossible to achieve but can influence the challenger's calculations by manipulating the costs of developing the undesired activity and executing it. Libicki (2021, 192), for example, asserts that a potential challenger needs to take into account\n> the relationship between the resources that must be invested to mount an attack and the resources that are expended to carry out an attack. If the latter are low, then having already decided to make the necessary investments, the decision to use them is likely to be influenced by the prospect of and losses from retaliation—but if the expected costs from retaliation are themselves low, the prospect of failure is likely to be of but modest importance because mounting the attack costs little.\nAlthough some scholars acknowledge this aspect of cost—which in fact challenges the clear distinction between deterrence by punishment and deterrence by denial—this insight has only marginally contributed to the (re)conceptualization of deterrence by denial: for example, in systematically considering the various costs the putative challenger may face in light of different strategies of deterrence. In other words, the distinguishing criteria of whether the deterrent threat aims to influence the challengers' perception of costs or of chances of success are not the most effective. For both strategies of deterrence—by punishment and by denial—the costs inflicted or manipulated by the defender have a significant influence on deterrence success.\n## Mapping Deterrence Strategies\nTo address the challenges discussed in the previous section, I offer a new categorization of deterrence to better conceptualize its diverse types. This categorization is based on two interrelated elements: the means the deterrer uses to threaten the putative challenger and the timing of their use.\nFor the first element, I distinguish between two main types of deterrent means: means based on offensive military capability and non-offensive means. Offensive\nAMIR LUPOVICI\nmeans are all those weapons that are used or threatened to be used to cause physical harm to an opponent. Non-offensive means are all the other means. Non-offensive means could obviously be defensive measures, but they could also be various other means that limit the damage, limit the challenger's benefits from the damage, prevent the challenger from translating the successful challenge into a meaningful achievement, or (threaten) to cause non-material costs for the putative challenger, such as through de-legitimization, shaming, and stigmatization.\nThe second element is the potential timing of the employment of the deterrent measures. Obviously, any measure needs advance preparation, development, and acquirement, as well as communication of its existence to the putative challenger. Nonetheless, a key question is whether the threat is of a measure that will be employed before or after the undesired activity occurs. Some measures are employed mainly in advance, before the unwanted activity takes place, while others are employed after the unwanted activity takes place. While issuing the threatening message occurs before the unwanted activity, it could rely on means that, if needed, will be exercised only after an unwanted activity would occur, for example, retaliation. Thus, the deterrent effect—if successful—is achieved by an opponent's understanding that these means will follow the undesired activity. Conversely, for some other deterrent measures, the deterrent effect is achieved by the putative challenger's understanding that the deterrent means are already exercised, such as in the case of walls or norm building.\nBased on this, I distinguish among four types of strategies of deterrence (see table 1).\n## Deterrence through Offensive Means Used before the Execution of the Undesired Activity\nActors use offensive means in a number of ways prior to the putative unwanted activity in order to deter it.\n## Denial Capabilities\nActors may threaten to use offensive means prior to the execution of the undesired activity to establish their ability to deny the effect of the potential challenge and thus signal to the putative challenger that it is a worthless endeavor. The idea behind this strategy is not just to physically eliminate the capabilities of the opponent, as evident in defensive strategies, but also to signal to the challenger that allocating resources to this goal is too costly given that the goal may not be accomplished. As Sawyer (2021, 111) argues,\n4My categorization is inspired by Wirtz (2021, 127–8), who acknowledges the various ways to attain deterrence thorough retaliation, punishment, and denial and distinguishes among three ways of using offensive means for deterrence by denial: “(1) threats to launch preemptive attack or preventive war to deny the opponent military capability to launch an attack; (2) threats to defeat an attack where and when it occurs…or (3) threats to eliminate the ‘bone of contention’,” thus temporary success will not lead to a political gain. However, there are a number of differences between his discussion and my framework. First, I more directly offer a systematic way to distinguish between the offensive means by putting forward the timing of their use. Second, I contrast these offensive strategies with non-offensive ones as part of the systematic categorization. Lastly, Wirtz limits his discussion to attempts to deter territorial changes.\n5My categorization is also inspired by Smith and Talbot (2008, 56–9), who distinguish among different levels of deterrence by denial: tactical, operational, and strategic. These, respectively, concern means used to prevent the act of terrorism, means that aim to prevent terrorist capabilities, and means of preventing the goals the terrorists pursue. As such, their study overlaps with the categorization suggested in this article, as timing plays a significant role in both. Nonetheless, Smith and Talbot’s categorizations also differ considerably from mine. First, Smith and Talbot focus specifically on deterring terrorism, while I use the categorization to explore various unwanted activities. Second, and more importantly, I focus on the timing of the employment of the means the deterrer actor uses, while their classification concerns the timing of the effect of the deterrence strategy. As a result, the offered categorization allows us to better compare deterrence by denial and deterrence by punishment and thus to better grasp these two types of strategies. The suggested categorization also overlaps with Zilincik and Sweijs (2023), who distinguish between different timings—before, during, and after an attack. Nonetheless, not only does their research focus on denial strategies and not on strategies of deterrence, but as a result, they also rely on different timing and consider different categories. Furthermore, their main goal is to examine the emotional effects of different denial strategies.\n8\nDeterrence through Inflicting Costs\nTable 1. Categorization of deterrence strategies\n|  Timing of use of deterrent means | The means the deterrer actor uses  |   |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|   |  Offensive measures | Non-offensive measures  |\n|  Before the execution of the undesired activity | • Denial of opponent’s capabilities\n• “Defend Forward” | • Resilience\n• De-legitimization\n• Passive defensive measures (e.g., walls)\n• “Spoofing”  |\n|  After the execution of the undesired activity | • Retaliation\n• Denying military achievements | • Active defensive systems (e.g., anti-ballistic missiles)\n• Prevention of the benefit of the undesired activity  |\nCapability denial, when defined as restricting the adversary’s access to resources required for the targeted behavior, is largely indistinguishable from an offensive strategy aimed at eliminating the adversary’s capability. However, when it is defined as strategic communication intended to alter perceptions about the availability and acquisition costs for necessary resources ... it too is a case of dissuasion.\nThis strategy is evident in threats to make a preventive or preemptive strike in a way that denies the challenger’s military option (Wirtz 2021, 127). The idea is that these strikes will not just physically prevent the challenger’s ability to perform the unwanted action but will also signal that developing such an option is a useless effort.\nSome of Israel’s operations can be understood in this context. While Israel has traditionally emphasized the strategy of deterrence by punishment (Adamsky 2017), its offensive capabilities are also used for deterrence by denial (Inbar and Sandler 1993, 322). One example is the destruction in 2007 of a nuclear reactor, secretly built in the Deir ez-Zor region in eastern Syria. While the attack was carried out through a covert airstrike to reduce the chances of an escalation, its details were officially revealed a few years later (Matania and Bachrach 2023, 13–4). Although some scholars, such as Bar (2020, 332), see Israel’s preventive and preemptive strikes as part of establishing deterrence by punishment (and cumulative deterrence), another message is being implicitly delivered: that is, allocating resources to the goals of developing nuclear capabilities will be worthless given Israel’s ability and will to eliminate them in advance (Matania and Bachrach 2023, 21). As a result, they not only deny the challenger’s ability to acquire nuclear capabilities that would challenge Israel, but they also demonstrate the involved costs for the putative challenger to invest in such an allegedly pointless endeavor. In a similar way, the operation that started in late 2018 to destroy the tunnels Hizbullah mined from Southern parts of Lebanon into Israeli territory to invade Israel was not just to eliminate Hizbullah’s capabilities: It also had a deterrent message referring to the heavy costs and resources Hizbullah put into this project, especially given the difficulties of digging in the rocky ground of the Galilee (Matania and Bachrach 2023, 23). While Israel made no prior attempts to deter Hizbullah from establishing these tunnels, the destruction aimed, among other things, to send a deterrent message in order to affect Hizbullah’s future behavior. Again, it should be emphasized that in these cases, the\nAMIR LUPOVICI\ndeterrent mechanism concerns not just the inability to succeed but also the costs associated with committing to the challenge and preparing for it.\n## Defend Forward\nThe cyber domain provides some interesting examples of this strategy based on the advance use of offensive means. For example, while there is some ambiguity regarding whether \"defend forward\" is a strategy of deterrence (by punishment) or a departure from it (Fischerkeller and Harknett 2017; King and Gallagher 2020, 27–8; Whyte 2020, 210), some scholars have interpreted the US reliance on defend forward as a strategy that is based on denial through offensive means (Sweijs and Zilincik 2020, 148). As Borghard and Lonergan (2023) argue, \"Elements of the DoD's concept of defend forward resonate with a deterrence by denial strategy, specifically those aspects that are focused on counter-cyber operations to disrupt, deny, or degrade adversary offensive capabilities and infrastructure.\" The Department of Defense Cyber Strategy (DoD 2018, 1) clearly states, \"We will defend forward to disrupt or halt malicious cyber activity at its source, including activity that falls below the level of armed conflict.\" The deterrent message was described by General Paul Nakasone, Commander of US Cyber Command and Director of the National Security Agency, in the February 2019 Congressional testimony, in which he argued that these efforts could increase the costs of opponents' military actions through \"craft[ing] tools and tactics to frustrate their efforts\" (in Borghard and Lonergan 2023, 561). He echoes the idea that deterrence by denial aims to influence an opponent not just by affecting the putative challenger's estimations of success, but also by increasing the costs of conducting the undesired activity.\n## Deterrence through Threatening to Use Offensive Means after the Execution of the Undesired Activity\nDeterring threats may also refer—and often do—to threats that will be implemented if the unwanted activity were to occur. In contrast to the first category, which refers to deterrent means that are operated prior to the execution of the unwanted activity, in this category the timing of using the deterrent means is after the execution of the unwanted activity—that is if the unwanted activity has already occurred.\n## Deterrence by Retaliation\nThis strategy is evident most clearly in cases of deterrence by punishment, where the defender threatens to retaliate—that is the threat is to use offensive means after an unwanted activity occurred—in order to convince a putative challenger to avoid it. The fundamental idea of this strategy is that credibly threatening a putative challenger with a retaliation would lead the challenger to avoid the undesired behavior, at least if the cost of punishment would exceed any potential gain (e.g., George and Smoke 1974; Morgan 2003, 1–25). As noted above, this idea has been widely developed in the context of nuclear deterrence, but it has also shaped strategies based on different offensive means, including, in recent years, cyber deterrence (e.g., in Wilner 2020, 252–4). The idea is that if deterrence works, actors will avoid challenging a deterrer actor because of the costs the retaliation would pose. For this reason, and acknowledging the limited availability of cyber targets that would allow deterrers to impose high costs on putative challengers, actors are advised to retaliate against cyberattacks not only with cyber means but also with traditional military kinetic means (e.g., Kugler 2009, 328; Schneider 2019).\n## Denial of Achievements\nThreatening to use offensive means after the challenger has executed the unwanted activity could also characterize situations of deterrence by denial (Buzan 1987, 136; Vanaga 2019, 171). Most prominently, this is the idea behind conventional military\n10\nDeterrence through Inflicting Costs\ndifference. Indeed, as Luttwak (1985, 3) notes, traditionally “the continuous deterrence generated by military force was generally treated as a bonus gain,” and their main goal was winning the war. Nonetheless, acquiring military capabilities had the advantage of not only providing a remedy for cases of an attack (and thus deterrence failure), but also affecting the putative challenger’s calculations about their chances of success. For this reason, Mazarr (2018, 2) argues that a useful way to estimate the effectiveness of deterrence by denial is to examine the “immediate balance of forces in the contested territory.” This clearly emphasizes that the costs the putative challenger may need to pay concern not just situations of deterrence by punishment but also situations of deterrence by denial. Obviously, attacking an opponent capable of defending will increase the costs for a putative challenger, not just because of retaliation but also because of the costs of waging the war, even if the challenger could win it. As Mazarr (2018, 6) notes, “Even if an attacker believes it might be successful in such cases, the costs of a long and painful war are a powerful preventive deterrent.”\n## Deterrence through Non-Offensive Means Used before the Execution of the Undesired Activity\nNon-offensive means could also be used for deterrent purposes, both prior to and following the execution of the unwanted activity of a challenger. Those used prior to the unwanted activity include a variety of strategies to threaten an opponent, such as de-legitimization, establishing resilience, and passive defense means such as establishing walls. This non-offensive deterrent means by denial work through limiting the potential damage of the undesired activity either by preventing the damage or by preventing the challenger’s ability to translate the undesired activity into meaningful damage. Exercising these means becomes part of the deterrent message the defender issues to the putative challenger.\n## De-Legitimization\nA number of scholars have pointed to de-legitimization as an effective means of deterrence by denial, especially against terrorism (Gearson 2012, 183). According to Stein Gross and Levi (2015, 417), “[T]he purpose is to manipulate the social rewards of prohibited action.” In their discussion, they rely on Wilner (2011, 26), who asserts, “[T]he objective is to reduce the challenger’s probability of achieving his goals by attacking the legitimacy of the beliefs that inform his behavior.” This strategy aims to influence the putative challenger’s perception of success—their ability to translate an attack into a political victory. Nonetheless, this strategy also relates to costs the putative challenger would pay in three meaningful ways. First, this means of deterrence through de-legitimization is partly based on the political costs the challenger will pay in their domestic arena (see also Wilner 2011, 27). Second, on the top of these costs are the direct costs associated with the means required to prepare and execute the undesired activity. Third, this strategy undermines the ability of the putative challenger to mobilize support, which also affects its available resources. In this respect, this creates costs, prevents gains, and denies its (future) capabilities.⁶\nNonetheless, the connections between de-legitimization and deterrence by denial success are complicated. On the one hand, there is some evidence that successful de-legitimization does not necessarily lead to effective deterrence. For example, Turkey successfully delegitimized the PKK (Kurdistan Workers’ Party) in the early 2000s, convincing many Western countries that it is a terror organization. However, while this successful de-legitimization had some effects on the PKK’s ability to mobilize resources and support (e.g., Casier 2010), it also “resulted in recurrence of\n⁶According to Stein Gross and Levi (2015, 416–7) and based on criminological research, deterrence by denial through de-legitimization can be based on three different audiences that affect the potential risks and rewards of the terrorists: formal authorities (law enforcement), social bonds, and informal control.\nold practices, including its default to violence” (Gürcan and Coşar Ünal 2018, 194). Conversely, some scholars have provided evidence to demonstrate terror organization leaders' sensitivity to legitimacy. For example, Knopf considers a message sent by the number two leader of al Qaeda, at the time, Ayman al-Zawahari, to the leader of this organization in Iraq, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, in which Zawahari “instructed Zarqawi that his methods, including indiscriminate attacks on Muslim civilians and the release of videos showing hostage beheadings, were so excessive they had become counterproductive.” According to Zawahiri, ‘the strongest weapon which the mujahadeen enjoys .... is popular support from the Muslim masses ... [meaning] the mujahed movement must avoid any action that the masses do not understand or approve'” (Knopf 2010, 18, ftn, 92).\nDe-legitimization is also used to deter threats other than terrorism, such as deterring cyberattacks through the development of norms (Stevens 2012, 159; Nye 2017, 60--2), in this way increasing the costs the challenger would pay with regard to different audiences (Wilner 2020, 255). As Soesanto and Smeets argue, “the creation of norms and rules for state behaviour in cyberspace, will over time translate into a general principle of restraint, raise the reputational costs of bad behaviour” (Soesanto and Smeets 2020, 393).\nThis strategy is similarly used to deter attacks in outer space. According to Mckeown and Wilner (2020), one of the means to deter an attack on US satellites is through de-legitimization, which is based on “developing ‘norms of responsible behaviour' in outer space (so as to diplomatically isolate those who would break them)” (Mckeown and Wilner 2020, 401). In fact, some official reports, such as from the US Department of Defense (2014), have pointed to the need to rely on this strategy, recommending the “development of international norms of responsible behavior that enhance safety, security, and stability in space.” According to the report, advancing these norms can have “a positive effect on deterrence; even if potential adversaries are not deterred from conducting hostile or malicious acts in space, norms can help the international community identify and isolate aggressors” (DoD 2014).\nThis example thus captures both elements of deterrence by denial and of deterrence by punishment. On the one hand, it concerns the prevention of challengers' ability to translate a successful challenge into a meaningful political achievement. In situations where such norms are strong, domestic and international audiences will prevent the putative challenger from making it a political victory. On the other hand, it also concerns deterrence by punishment, especially since the putative challenger's fear is not just of material costs associated with the punishment, but also of psychological and social costs (Sweijs and Zilincik 2020, 149--50).\nThe logic of the nuclear taboo and the emergence of normative limits to the use of nuclear weapons increase the costs of using them and thus create self-deterrence mechanisms that also overlap with both deterrence by denial and deterrence by punishment. As Tannenwald argues, while taboos affect behavior in a number of ways, some of them rely on a deterrent effect achieved by increasing domestic and international public opinion costs (Tannenwald 2007, 48--9; see also Nye 2017, 60). According to her, the norm of the taboo has not only had a significant and direct impact on the avoidance of using nuclear weapons over the years, but it has also enhanced nuclear deterrence, and thus increased the costs decision-makers would pay if they used nuclear weapons in a first strike (Tannenwald 2007, 45). In this respect, policymakers' awareness of the norm, according to Tannenwald (2007), has dissuaded them from using these weapons.\n### Establishing Resilience\nThe demonstration of resilience is another way actors can exercise deterrence by denial with non-offensive measures prior to the execution of the undesired activity.\nDefenders demonstrate and communicate to a potential challenger that they will not be able to translate the execution of the undesired activity, even if successful, into a meaningful political benefit (Gearson 2012; Libicki 2021, 205). Resilience can be used in various contexts in multiple domains of competition and vis-à-vis different kinds of challenging actors: state and non-state (Sweijs and Zilincik 2020, 148). In addition, it can be employed with different means. For example, resilience can be achieved through technological solutions, such as backup and recovery systems in case of cyberattacks (Nye 2017, 56). Actors can also rely on developing procedures and routines to better prepare for absorbing undesired activities such as terror attacks, for example, by educating the public about such situations. Gearson (2012, 191) suggests that “[b]y demonstrating that a society is resilient and well prepared for dislocations and shock, with intelligent design and disaster recovery procedures embedded into government and private sector behaviour, the target communities will also be reassured and confident of recovery.” Furthermore, effective use of resilience mechanisms may create substantial costs for the putative challenger, implying that investing efforts in targeting the defender is not a wise decision for allocating resources. As Nye (2017, 56) suggests regarding these means, “Attackers have limited resources and time; therefore, driving up the costs can deter attacks.”\n### Defensive Means\nStrategies of deterrence by denial also rely on defensive means that could be used or employed before the execution of the undesired activity (e.g. Goldgeier and Wojtowicz. 2022, 5), including walls and fortifications. Cioffi-Revilla (1999), for example, uses archeological evidence from different regions to demonstrate that deterrence by denial was used thousands of years ago. According to him, massive walls “signal significant material capacity and likely organizational know-how to implement deterrence by denial” (Cioffi-Revilla 1999, 247). These walls are also used in modern times with varying degrees of success, including against armies and terror attacks (Naroll et al. 1974, Brantly 2018, 35) and even against migrants (Kent et al. 2020, 856, 864). The intention in these cases is to deter by signaling to individuals and armies that they will not be able to achieve their desired goals or that they will need to invest substantial resources toward it. Findings from migration scholarship show that while walls decrease the number of people who cross these specific areas, the numbers often increase in other areas (Kent et al. 2020, 871). This echoes the point about the interrelated effects of the costs and chances of success in executing an action a deterrer actor attempts to prevent. Lastly, passive defense measures like “civil defense” are also based on non-military means that serve deterrence by denial, such as using shelters or evacuating populations in certain scenarios. These measures are used prior to the occurrence of the unwanted activity (Freedman 2004, 37). While such measures can also be costly for the defender, they significantly limit the potential gain a putative challenger can make from executing the unwanted activity, and thus may decrease its attractiveness.\nSome cyber defensive measures may seem similar to traditional security means: for example, (fire-)walls, which are used to harden cyber targets and defend against cyberattacks and thus could have deterrent effect (Nye 2017, 56). Cyber technologies provide some other unique ways to use this type of strategy, for example, by remodeling the cyber terrain. This may enhance cyber defense and thus has deterrence by denial effects (Matania and Tal-Shir 2020, 292).\n### Spoofing\nPlanting dummy targets makes the execution of the unwanted activity more costly and thus can be used as a strategy of deterrence by denial. The rationale is that planting dummy targets increases the potential future efforts and costs the putative challengers need to invest since resources have to be allocated to identify the real\nAMIR LUPOVICI\n13\ntargets. An example of this kind of deterrence is evident in protecting maritime vessels. According to Gutman and Rojkes Dombe (2017), defenders may exercise this strategy through electronic means that signal locations of alleged vessels that do not really exist. As they note, “planting hundreds of military dummy targets, through the AIS [Automatic Identification System] protocol, into the status picture of defending side’s coastal layout” creates a deterrence by denial effect, dissuading an opponent from going out to sea to begin with (Gutman and Rojkes Dombe 2017). While powerful actors, such as the United States, may have resources and various capabilities that allow them to exactly trace the location of vessels—such as through intelligence, reconnaissance, and surveillance assets (e.g., Mirski 2013, 406)—not all putative challengers have access to these capabilities.\nAnother example is the music industry’s attempt in the early 2000s to deter the sharing of media files through streaming services such as Napster. Various measures were used to complicate access to these files and thus to deter potential users (Pesta 2004, 406–10; Jennings and Bossler 2020). Spoofing was one of these methods, where copyright holders uploaded corrupted files, including fake music files, that provided computer users with “static, popping, cracking noises, or silence instead of the unauthorized music file they were attempting to download” (Pesta 2004, 408–9). The industry even hired some companies to distribute these fake files (Segal 2002). The explicit aim of these attempts was to create a deterrent effect: Given the time and costs of downloading files in the early 2000s, the attractiveness of this activity was lessened by actors’ knowledge that there was a good chance the file would be corrupted. In the end, the deterrent effect was aimed to be achieved by reducing the likelihood of success of downloading the media files. Nonetheless, the strategy also emphasizes the importance of “costs” for deterrence by denial. If there were no costs to downloading the music—internet costs, time invested in searching for the files, the annoyance of downloading a corrupted file—then there would be no deterrent effect. Interestingly, as Jennings and Bossler (2020, 1038–9) note, this strategy had little deterrent effect because the corrupted files were identified and so users could avoid them.\n## Deterrence through Threatening to Use Non-Offensive Means after the Execution of the Undesired Activity\nLastly, actors could threaten to use non-offensive measures after absorbing the undesired activity. Most commonly, this could be done through threatening to use defensive measures to deny the effectiveness of the challenge, for example, thorough “anti-aircraft or anti-ballistic missile systems designed to bring down the enemy offensive before any targets were reached” (Freedman 2004, 37). Clearly, the defender needs to have these capabilities as well as to communicate them to the putative challenger to dissuade the unwanted action (see also Golov 2016, 89).\nAn effective deterrence by denial carries the message that preparing and executing the challenge would be costly because the resources allocated would not be worth it. As Sawyer (2021, 111) notes, “Tactical denial—communication about target-hardening efforts—conveys the adversary that it must adopt new tactics, which are likely to increase the cost or uncertainty of action in the short term.” Denial could be established on defensive components in such a way that “an adver\n7Scholars have pointed to a number of challenges concerning this strategy: for example, the limited credibility of reliance on defensive systems for deterrence, especially given the limited “margin of error” (Freedman 2004, 37), their costs (Adamsky 2021, 184), the challenges they create for deterrence by punishment (Adamsky 2021, 185), and the incentives they may give to a putative challenger in order to exhaust the defensive systems budget (Brantly 2018, 36). For a review of strategic negative implications of defensive systems on deterrence, see Quackenbush (2006, 533), who nonetheless contends that these systems eventually enhance deterrence success (Quackenbush 2006, but see Golov 2016).\nsary cannot go on the offense without incurring significant costs” (Borghard and Lonergan 2017, 474). This view is part of how Katagiri (2021), who focuses on deterrence through defensive means, defines deterrence by denial. According to him, it is the “ability to deny actions and persuade the opponent that it is unlikely to attain its immediate objectives at a reasonable cost” (Katagiri 2021, 203, my emphasis). This means that defensive measures may increase the costs for a putative challenger to execute the attack and thus, as in deterrence by punishment, may affect not only their chance of success but also their costs of planning, developing, and executing the challenge.\nTo take a more concrete example, Israel in recent years has shifted its strategy, relying increasingly on active defense systems to cover various types of threats, including the Iron Dome missile defense batteries that aim to intercept short-range rockets and the Arrow system that aims to intercept long-range missiles. Although skeptical about how effective these defensive measures are in creating successful deterrence, Adamsky (2021, 178--81) acknowledges that the changes in the strategic environment “produced a much stronger emphasis on defense in Israeli national security, and thus somewhat expanded the role of deterrence by denial in Israel strategic thought.”\nActive defense systems are also used for deterrence by denial strategies to dissuade cyberattacks. While the question remains as to whether these defensive systems could effectively provide defense or deterrence by denial, a number of scholars suggest this at least as a theoretical option (Borghard and Lonergan 2023, 534-5). Schneider (2019, 113), for example, argues that “cyber defense” could be achieved through “securing nodes of civilian and military networks” such as space-based satellites and optic cables. The point, however, is that while cyber infrastructures could be defended with passive means, they could also be defended by active defense measures, including kinetic means such as ballistic missiles, as part of a cross-domain deterrence.\nHowever, non-offensive means do not necessarily need to be military ones. For example, policies of deterrence to prevent immigration rely on means used after the perceived unwanted activity occurs such as detaining immigrants, preventing social benefits and work rights, and reducing access to legal due process (Kent et al. 2020, 856). All these means are characterized by being employed after the unwanted action has taken place—the immigrants have already entered a country whose government aims to deter immigration. The idea behind these deterrent policies is to demonstrate to potential immigrants that they will not be able to succeed: for example, they will be unable to work in the target country. This negates the value of the costs invested in the immigration process and in the efforts to immigrate into their territories.\n## Toward a Revised Theory of Deterrence by Denial\nThe discussion so far demonstrates that while deterrence by punishment and deterrence by denial can be contrasted if we consider them through their strategic goals, overlaps can be seen by looking at the strategies' means as well as their timing. For example, both deterrence by denial and deterrence by punishment could be established by using offensive means, even those used after the execution of the challenge. The discussion also shows that inflicting costs is a significant element not only of deterrence by punishment but also of deterrence by denial. The strategy of deterrence by denial involves mechanisms that can increase the costs for the putative challenger, including costs associated with resources to prepare for and conduct the undesired activity. Some strategies of deterrence by denial concern other\nkinds of costs, such as costs the actor may pay in domestic and international arenas about its legitimization, which can affect its ability (and motivation) to execute the undesired activity. Taking these elements together, and acknowledging the overlap between deterrence by punishment and deterrence by denial, opens a path to further theorize deterrence by denial. Furthermore, acknowledging the overlap may lead a more general theory of deterrence to account for both types of deterrence.\nWhile it is beyond the scope of this article to cover all the factors accounting for the success of deterrence by denial, taking steps toward this goal could prove useful to demonstrate the advantages of the suggested conceptualization when it comes to explaining deterrence success and considering the adoption of the strategy.\n### Deterrence Success—The Balance of Costs\nAs demonstrated above, different means of both deterrence by punishment and deterrence by denial may incur costs in various ways for putative challengers. It follows then that a key concept in accounting for deterrence success (of deterrence by either punishment or denial) is the balance of costs. When the costs to the putative challenger of executing the challenge are low—because the cost of expected retaliation is low, because the costs of the means for the attack are low, because the costs of executing the attack are low, and/or because the domestic audience supports paying these costs—the challenge will be much more difficult to successfully deter. Similarly, when acquiring or using the means of deterrence is costly for the defender, it is difficult to threaten using them as deterrents (see also Matania and Bachrach 2023).\nThis was exactly the situation with Israel's reliance on defensive measures to deter Hamas rockets launched from Gaza using the Iron Dome system. The costs for Hamas were between 500 and 1,000 US dollars per Katyusha rocket, while each intercepting missile costs 50,000 and a battery of Iron Dome costs around 100 million US dollars (Brantly 2018, 36). Although the costs for Israel in a situation without any defensive measures might be much higher given the potential damage these rockets can do, this system's deterrent effect in preventing these attacks is very limited. In fact, some have pointed out that these unbalanced costs may incentivize Hamas to challenge Israel to erode its security budget. This is why former Israeli Prime Minister, Naftali Bennet (2022), declared that Israel is developing a defense system based on laser technology: To change “[t]he economic equation ... If it is possible to intercept a missile or rocket with just an electric pulse that costs a few dollars, we will have nullified the ring of fire that Iran has set up on our borders. The whole thing no longer pays off.”\nIn contrast, in other cases, the deterrer actors may be the ones who enjoy the “balance of costs.” An interesting example is provided by Lior Div, the CEO of Cybereason, a cyber security company. Although he does not refer to the concept of deterrence by denial, he clearly demonstrates this logic when discussing the SolarWinds attack. This was a serious cyberattack, likely sponsored by a foreign government, that infected numerous computers in the United States in late 2020, including nine government agencies and a hundred private companies. In an interview, Div noted that “SolarWinds attackers scanned networks to determine if Cybereason's software was installed. If they saw that it was present, they bypassed it and moved along to another network” (Levy 2021). Given the system's past successes, the hackers did not want it to gather information on their malicious code. This is an example of deterrence by denial based on the challenger's fear that the system could effectively detect and neutralize the attack and thus render the efforts invested in the malicious code useless. More generally, while not entirely deterring the use of this attack and not using fear of retaliation, the Cybereason system effectively deterred by denial the attack on the computers on which it operated.\nAnother important factor affecting the balance of costs, and thus deterrence success, is the cost for the putative challenger of identifying relevant targets and knowing how costly it would be to execute the challenge: for example, in case of defensive missiles, how costly it would be for a putative challenger to identify areas the system cannot fully cover, or, similarly, in the case of building walls, how costly (how many resources it would take) it would be for immigrants to identify alternative routes to those blocked by walls. It could be that these latter costs are not high, as evidence shows that while walls have a deterrent effect, the number of those crossing in areas without walls increases (Kent et al. 2020, 871). Another example is in the case of spoofing. As noted above, the costs of identifying the fake media files were very low (Jennings and Bossler 2020, 1038--9), which led to deterrence failure. Nonetheless, planting dummy targets at sea seems a much more effective strategy given that many actors do not have access to measures that allow them to identify the real targets, thus significantly increasing their costs to distinguish between real and faked ones (Gutman and Rojkes Dombe 2017).\nThe cost of knowing is also affected by another factor; that is, the costs to execute the activity the defender aims to prevent. When the costs to execute the unwanted activity are very low, the costs of knowing become less important, since a putative challenger may easily challenge many possible targets. For example, as noted above, when the cost for launching rockets is low, as in the case of the rockets Hamas launches against Israel (Brantly 2018, 36), putative challengers do not need to invest many resources into identifying alternative targets, thus indicating the limited effectiveness of deterrence by denial.\nThe costs of knowing are also relevant for deterrence by punishment. In some cases, deterrer actors, indeed, clearly state what the costs would be for executing the unwanted behavior and what would be considered as such a behavior. Nonetheless, in many other cases, the deterrent threat includes ambiguities (see Crawford 2003, 11--2) that force the putative challenger to invest resources in identifying the structure of costs. In terms of the balance of costs, this adds another layer and trade-off of costs affecting deterrence success.\nLastly, the balance of costs may also be affected by different mechanisms and means operated at different times. This is because a deterrent means may incur additional costs at times other than when they are exercised. Acknowledging the different categories presented above, which refer to different timings at which the deterrent means are exercised, may thus point to other ways to enhance the deterrent threat. For example, as discussed above, building norms is a non-offensive deterrent means used prior to the execution of the unwanted activity. Its effectiveness stems from policymakers' sensitivity to the domestic and international public opinion costs, and thus on their ability to translate the unwanted activity into a meaningful political achievement. However, while normative structures create a pre-condition for deterrence success, the deterrent effect may be enhanced by other mechanisms that could be exercised if an unwanted activity takes place, such as naming and shaming. Breaking norms inflict “a kind of social punishment on the normative transgressor. A loss of face amongst the international community is the likely outcome of such a naming and shaming exercise” (Ryan 2018, 337). In other words, naming and shaming practices allow an actor to translate the norm into a specific deterrent threat, and thus to incur more concrete costs (Schulz 2015, 41). Conversely, decision-makers who know that no one would translate the inappropriate behavior into costs would be less affected by the norm.\nFurthermore, these dynamics could also have future deterrent effects, even if they failed. In this respect, although exercising naming and shaming demonstrates deterrence failure, as neither the norm nor the possibility of naming and shaming dissuaded the unwanted activity, it may clarify the potential costs for future similar behavior. In addition, practicing naming and shaming may help mobilize opponents to this behavior, resulting in a future increase in the costs of the unwanted activity.\nAMIR LUPOVICI\n17\nIn this respect, these dynamics are similar to what is considered in the scholarship as cumulative deterrence, where the actual retaliation is used to clarify for putative challengers the capabilities and resolve of the defender (e.g., Stein 1996; Kello 2017, 209–11; Kirchofer 2017; Tor 2017).\n## Adoption of Deterrence Strategy\nIn addition, the overlap between deterrence by punishment and deterrence by denial could be used to elaborate on elements that affect the adoption of the strategy. The discussion above emphasizes not only the strategies the deterrer actor uses but also the means and timing. This provides a useful point of departure for asking questions about the reliance on deterrence strategies in general or about the exact type of deterrence, as well as about the specific means used for deterrence purposes. For example, cultural elements may explain actors’ reliance on non-offensive measures for deterrence. The case of Japan, given its culture and constitutional restrictions, is a key example of an actor that relies on deterrence by denial through defensive systems (Katagiri 2021). As Katagiri (2021, 207) explains, in addition to extended deterrence it receives, Japan’s doctrine is based on “defensive defence, which bans offensive use of force even in wartime. It means that defensive force can only be used in the event of a foreign attack and is limited to the minimum necessary for self-defence. Since the 1970s it has informed Japan’s deterrence-by-denial posture and affected weapons programs and operations.”\nIn a similar way, cultural and social elements may explain a state’s reliance on strategies of deterrence by punishment or deterrence by denial that mainly use offensive measures. For Israel, for example, reliance on the actual use of force as part of practicing deterrence, and especially cumulative deterrence, is a formative idea (Bar-Joseph 1998, 156–7; Almog 2004–5; Bar 2020, 324–5, 330–1). It is related not only to strategic elements, but also to cultural, social, and political ones (Sucharov 2005, 31, 68; Barnett 2013, 37–47; Lupovici 2016, 54). From this perspective, it matters little whether the strategy relies on deterrence by punishment or deterrence by denial. Rather, the important elements are the means used and the ability to employ them as part of a strategy of deterrence.\n## Conclusion\nIn this article, I offered a new way to distinguish among different types of deterrence strategies based on the means used for deterrent threats and the timing of when actors threaten to use them. I demonstrated each of the various types by considering examples from kinetic and cyber domains. I argue that using this categorization better captures the differences and overlapping of deterrence by punishment and deterrence by denial. In addition, viewing deterrence through these lenses also emphasizes that inflicting costs is a key aspect not only of deterrence by punishment but also of deterrence by denial.\nExploring these issues helps us to further theorize about deterrence by denial, whose study currently lags behind the research on deterrence by punishment. While this paper acknowledges this gap, it also offers and demonstrates a direction to close it by contextualizing the means deterrer actors use and recognizing that costs are an aspect common to both types of deterrence.\nI conclude by pointing to a broader research agenda derived from this research. First, this discussion helps us to reconsider how factors already acknowledged in deterrence scholarship may have different effects on the categories presented above. For example, scholars acknowledge the importance of communicating capabilities and intentions. Means used before defenders experience the challenge—either defensively or offensively—may communicate the threat more effectively than those employed only post-factum, as, for example, in the case of traditional deterrence\n18\nDeterrence through Inflicting Costs\nby punishment. Furthermore, thinking through this lens may inspire research on other factors affecting deterrence success. Second, and along with the previous point, this research allows us to consider, categorize, and explain different strategies of deterrence. For example, in recent years scholars have pointed to the strategy of threatening to reveal the identity of a putative challenger through the notion of deterrence by detection or by accusation (e.g., Lindsay and Gartzke 2018, 192; Finnemore and Hollis 2020, 980–1; Wilner 2020, 271). The framework suggested here would locate this strategy as a non-offensive means operated after the execution of the undesired action: for example, technological means will help to identify post-factum who committed the attack, but communicating this capability in advance could have a deterrent effect. Considering this strategy in this category allows us to develop specific factors to account for its failure or success and help us to better contrast it with other strategies of deterrence.\nAlso important in further developing explanations of deterrence success, as discussed above, is to focus on costs or the balance of costs. Again, one set of questions concerns how costs—and not just costs of a retaliatory strike—could be communicated, including communicating both the ability to inflict costs and the intention to use these capabilities. Furthermore, distinguishing among different types of costs inflicted at different points of time is also a promising direction for theorizing deterrence success, including that of deterrence by denial.\nThis categorization inspires additional questions about the adoption of the strategy. For example, scholars could explore whether actors prioritize some means for deterrent purposes over others, such as in the Japanese and Israeli cases briefly discussed above. Scholars could also ask more specific questions about key concepts, such as the cult of reputation (Tang 2005). For example, they could compare the effects of this cult on actors’ reliance on offensive and non-offensive means when they consider adopting or issuing a deterrent threat.\nFinally, on an empirical level, this framework offers a useful direction to explore cyber deterrence further. As noted above, while deterrence by denial seems a more effective strategy to address cyber security concerns, such research requires further theoretical development (e.g., Borghard and Lonergan 2023, 534-5). My research addresses this challenge by offering specific directions to explore cyber deterrence success (and its adoption). For example, the emphasis of this conceptual framework on “costs” is pertinent to exploring cyber security given the various costs involved for both the defender and the putative challenger. Likewise, cyber technologies could spark interesting debates on the distinction between offensive and non-offensive means both in thinking about deterrence success and in studying the adoption of the strategy. This is especially important given questions about what counts as offensive or violent means in the cyber domain, and thus what legitimizes a response and with what means (Lupovici 2019, 181).",

  "flat_text": "International Studies Review (2023), viad036 ANALYTICAL ESSAY # Deterrence through Inflicting Costs: Between Deterrence by Punishment and Deterrence by Denial AMIR LUPOVICI Tel Aviv University, Israel The strategy of deterrence by denial is widely used by different actors. Despite its prominence, however, the scholarship on deterrence by denial stands to be developed further. It lags behind scholarship on deterrence by punishment on two points: in identifying the conditions under which the strategy works and in examining elements affecting its adoption. Deterrence by denial also carries some conceptual ambiguity since its employment takes many significantly different forms and also because it overlaps with deterrence by punishment. Despite the emphasis in current scholarship on\"inflicting costs\"as a defining element of deterrence by punishment, costs arguably also play a significant role in deterrence by denial. To address these challenges, I distinguish between deterrence strategies by focusing on two main elements: the means the deterrer actor threatens to use (offensive or non-offensive) and the timing of the threatened use of these means (before or after the unwanted activity). This offers a more nuanced distinction between deterrence strategies and better encompasses the role of inflicting costs in deterrence by denial. I suggest that this research offers a useful point of departure to further theorize about deterrence by denial, and it sets a promising research agenda that is pertinent given the growing interest in deterrence by denial, especially in its application to cyber deterrence.\nLa estrategia de disuasión por negación es ampliamente utilizada por diferentes agentes. Sin embargo, a pesar de su importancia, el conocimiento académico relativo a la disuasión por negación debe desarrollarse aún en mayor medida. El conocimiento académico relativo a la disuasión por negación se ha quedado atrasado en comparación con el conocimiento académico relativo a la disuasión por castigo en dos puntos: la identificación de las condiciones bajo las cuales funciona la estrategia y el estudio de los elementos que afectan su adopción. La disuasión por negación también conlleva cierta ambigüedad conceptual, ya que se utiliza de muchas formas, significativamente diferentes entre ellas, y también porque se solapa con la disuasión por castigo. A pesar del énfasis existente en el mundo académico actual en usar el hecho de «imponer costes» como un elemento definitorio de la disuasión por castigo, estos costes también juegan un papel importante en la disuasión por negación. Con el fin de abordar estos desafíos, hacemos una distinción entre ambas estrategias de disuasión centrándonos en dos elementos principales: los medios Lupovici, Amir.

Esto nos ofrece una distinción más matizada entre ambas estrategias de disuasión y engloba de una mejor forma el papel que juega el hecho de imponer costes dentro de la disuasión por negación. Sugerimos que esta investigación ofrece un punto de partida útil para teorizar de forma más profunda sobre la disuasión por negación, y establece una agenda de investigación prometedora, la cual resulta relevante debido al creciente interés en materia de la disuasión por negación, especialmente en su aplicación a la disuasión cibernética.\nLa stratégie de dissuasion par le déni est largement employée par divers acteurs. Néanmoins, malgré son importance, elle ne fait l'objet que de peu de travaux de recherche. Elle a du retard par rapport à la recherche sur la dissuasion par la punition à deux niveaux: quand il s'agit d'identifier les conditions de fonctionnement d'une stratégie et quand il s'agit d'analyser les éléments qui ont une incidence sur son adoption. La dissuasion par le déni s'accompagne également d'une certaine ambiguïté conceptuelle, car son emploi revêt des formes très différentes et elle a tendance à recouper la dissuasion par la punition. Malgré l'accent actuel des recherches sur les « coûts infligés » comme élément définitoire de la dissuasion par la punition, ceux-ci pourraient bien aussi jouer un rôle important dans la dissuasion par le déni. Pour répondre à ces défis, je distingue les stratégies de dissuasion en me concentrant sur deux éléments principaux: les moyens que l'acteur dissuasif menace d'utiliser (offensifs ou non) et la temporalité d'application de cette menace (avant ou après l'activité indésirable). Ainsi apparaît une distinction plus nuancée des stratégies de dissuasion, qui représente plus justement le rôle des coûts infligés dans la dissuasion par le déni. Selon moi, ce travail de recherche propose un point de départ utile quand il s'agit de pousser la théorisation de la dissuasion par le déni et un programme de recherche prometteur et pertinent, étant donné l'intérêt croissant pour la dissuasion par le déni, en particulier pour son application de cyberdissuasion.\nKeywords: deterrence, deterrence by denial Palabras clave: disuasión, disuasión por negación Mots clés: dissuasion, dissuasion par le déni # Introduction A key classical distinction in deterrence scholarship is between deterrence by punishment and deterrence by denial. Suggested as early as the late 1950s, this distinction in its original formulation focuses on whether the deterrent threat emphasizes the cost for the putative challengers if they execute the undesired activity (deterrence by punishment) or puts into question the challenger's ability to achieve its goals (deterrence by denial). As Wilner and Wenger (2021, 7) explain,\"[W]hereas punishment manipulates behavior by augmenting costs, denial works by stripping away benefits... so whereas punishment deters through the fear of pain, denial deters through the fear of failure.\"This distinction has been important for the emergence of deterrence research. Given the prominence of nuclear deterrence and its impact on this research, the concept of deterrence by punishment is conspicuous in how the study emerged.\nIt is only in recent years that the concept of deterrence by denial has started to attract greater attention (e.g., Smith and Talbot 2008; Gearson 2012; Brantly 2018; Adamsky 2021; Wenger and Wilner 2021; Zilincik and Swejs 2023; Borghard and Lonergan 2023). This shift is due mainly to changes in the threat environment—the advancement of new regional and global powers on the one hand, and the grow ing role of low-level conflicts, including terrorism and cyber conflicts, on the other. These changes have clarified the need for alternatives to the dominant strategy of deterrence by punishment. For example, some studies have suggested cyber deterrence by denial as an alternative because of the challenges of successfully implementing cyber deterrence by punishment, mainly the problem of attribution. In addition, organizational competencies and technological developments, such as the advancement of better defensive measures enhance the attractiveness of the strategy of deterrence by denial (e.g. Slayton 2017, 89--90; Lilli 2021, 171; Lupovici 2021, 1687).\nI argue, however, that despite the advantages of the concept of deterrence by denial, it can be further developed theoretically and clarified conceptually. Foremost, while there is a consensus among scholars regarding key factors affecting the success of deterrence by punishment, that is, capability, credibility, and communication (e.g. Morgan 2003, 15--20), much less has been theorized about the conditions under which deterrence by denial succeeds. Likewise, the research could also be developed with regard to studying the adoption of deterrence by denial. For example, while some studies have focused on the social and cultural elements affecting the adoption of deterrence by punishment, we know much less in this regard about the adoption of deterrence by denial strategies (but see Målksoo2021).\nSecond, deterrence by denial refers to various distinct mechanisms—such as defense, resilience, denial, and prevention—grouped under one category. This ambiguity not only reveals the need to clarify and map the sub-categories of deterrence by denial, but it also aggravates the challenge in studying the success of deterrence by denial—that is, in determining whether each sub-category of deterrence by denial is successful under the same conditions. In addition, and even more challenging, is the overlap between deterrence by punishment and deterrence by denial. As I discuss below, contrary to common wisdom that emphasizes the clear distinction between deterrence by punishment and deterrence by denial, both strategies concern the sensitivity of the putative challenger to “costs.” In other words, while I agree that deterrence by denial focuses on the fear of failure, this strategy is also affected by the manipulation of actors' sensitivity to “costs.” Therefore, inflicting “costs,” while considered a key element of deterrence by punishment, provides a limited borderline between deterrence by punishment and deterrence by denial since it plays a significant role in both kinds of deterrence. Some scholars have put this idea forward: for example, Brantly (2018, 35) clearly argues that both “[d]eterrence by punishment and denial are intended to manipulate the cost-benefit analysis of an adversary.” Likewise, a number of scholars have acknowledged the importance of incurring costs for deterrence by denial (e.g. Gross Stein and Levi 2015, 411; Nye 2017, 56; Mazarr 2018, 6; Libicki 2021, 192; Sawyer 2021, 111; Matania and Bachrach 2023; Zilincik and Sweijs 2023, 261). However, rather than seeing this finding as an obstacle, I argue it is an opportunity not only to clarify this strategy but also to develop a more extensive concept of deterrence in general as well as of deterrence by denial specifically.\nTo achieve this goal, I offer a new conceptualization of deterrence based on two elements: the means used by the deterrer actor to threaten (offensive or non-offensive) and the timing of the threatened use of these means (before or after the unwanted activity occurs). This theoretical move provides a way to clarify the concept of deterrence by denial and a better way to distinguish among different types of deterrence strategies, including by punishment and by denial, and thus avoids the binary distinction between them. Furthermore, this move offers a useful point of departure to advance the research of deterrence by denial success, which lags behind the research of deterrence by punishment success (Gross Stein and Levi 2015, 411; Wilner and Wenger 2021, 7; Zilincik and Sweijs 2023, 249). For example, if we Deterrence through Inflicting Costs acknowledge that deterrence by punishment and deterrence by denial overlap (i.e., they both concern inflicting costs), we can better rely on the existing scholarship of deterrence by punishment and draw important insights from it concerning both the success and the adoption of deterrence by denial. As a result, while it is beyond the scope of this paper to fully explore deterrence success, I do aim to demonstrate the advantages of the suggested conceptualization toward this goal.\nThe article unfolds as follows. In the first section, I identify a few issues on which the research of deterrence by denial could be further developed. In the second, I suggest the new conceptualization of deterrence, based on the distinction among four different categories, and illustrate them through kinetic and cyber deterrence practices. In the third section, I consider the advantages of this conceptualization regarding the main challenges of the study of deterrence by denial. I conclude by discussing further implications for deterrence scholarship.\n## The Concept of Deterrence by Denial and its Limitations I argue that the concept of deterrence by denial could be developed further in two interrelated ways: by elaborating on the conditions under which it succeeds and is adopted and by addressing its conceptual ambiguity.\n## The Need for Further Development of Theoretical Explanations for Deterrence by Denial ### Deterrence Success In contrast to the rich scholarship of deterrence by punishment, much less is known about the conditions under which the strategy of deterrence by denial works. Scholars agree that the conditions needed for deterrence by punishment are based on defenders' capabilities, credibility, and communication; however, no such clear articulation of the conditions for deterrence by denial exists. For example, we do not fully know whether the traditional conditions for success of deterrence by punishment are relevant to deterrence by denial or whether we need to consider other conditions, nor do we know how actors deliver their threats in deterrence by denial strategies. While researchers have recently started to engage more specifically with these types of questions, the scholarship still requires more comprehensive theoretical discussion and empirical studies of these conditions. What we currently have are specific assertions about particular factors that might affect deterrence success, for example, from scholars who study conventional deterrence and focus on deterrence by denial based on military capabilities (e.g., Mearsheimer 1983, 24-30, 62-6). However, as I will further discuss below, deterrence by denial does not rely exclusively on offensive capabilities or on military means in general.\n### Deterrence Adoption Theories of deterrence by denial could also be developed through studies elaborating on how and when actors adopt this strategy. Most deterrence scholars focus on deterrence success rather than on its adoption. As Lupovici (2021) points out, diverting the focus to the adoption of the strategy might be useful, especially when details about deterrence success are limited or difficult to attain. Scholars have already started to explore two main elements that affect the adoption of the strategy: technological changes and cultural and social elements.\n\nAMIR LUPOVICI However, these studies have mainly been in the context of deterrence by punishment. For example, some scholars have pointed to how technological changes eased the development and adoption of deterrence by punishment during the Cold War. In a similar way, scholars have shown how social elements such as culture, identity, and routines shape the adoption and implementation of practices of deterrence by punishment in different contexts. However, similar questions could be asked about deterrence by denial (e.g., Målksoo 2021): for example, whether deterrence by denial allows actors to maintain their prestige and status in the same manner as deterrence through punishment and retaliation.\n## Conceptual Ambiguity The challenge of conceptual ambiguity arises from the various kinds of means of employing the strategy of deterrence by denial and from the difficulty of clearly distinguishing between deterrence by denial and deterrence by punishment.\n## Multiple Strategies While scholars who explored deterrence by denial originally tended to regard it as based primarily on defensive measures (e.g., Buzan 1987, 135), recent studies agree that deterrence by denial can be achieved in various ways. As Borghard and Lonergan (2023, 541) argue, “While defense can be one mechanism that contributes to deterrence by denial, it is not the only—or even primary—means of achieving denial.” More recent scholarship has also pointed to different means to practice deterrence by denial, such as de-legitimization, resilience, and law enforcement activities; as well as long-term effects based on repeated failures at both strategic and tactical levels.\nAlthough it is important to acknowledge the different means through which actors can operate deterrence by denial, a more comprehensive framework would provide a systematic way to categorize the various types of deterrence and thus to effectively compare and contrast among strategies of deterrence by denial and deterrence by punishment. This would also be important given the need to elucidate the conditions under which this strategy works (or is adopted). In other words, it would help to show whether different conditions are necessary for success for different sub-categories of deterrence by denial.\n## Overlap of “Costs” As Wilner and Wenger (2021, 7) observe, scholars suggest that the effect of deterrence by punishment is achieved by fear of retaliation, and the deterrent effect of deterrence by denial is achieved by fear of failure (see also von Hlatky 2015, 4). While they aptly summarize the scholarship, I suggest that the distinction between deterrence by punishment and deterrence by denial is not as clear as many scholars assume.\nFirst, as Buzan (1987, 135), for example, has noted, “[I]n military terms, denial and defense have virtually identical meanings. Those who treat deterrence and defence as alternatives are assuming that deterrence is likewise synonymous with retaliation.” According to Buzan (1987, 136), since the purpose of deterrence is to prevent “unwanted actions before they occur... [L]ogically, therefore the concept of deterrence encompasses both denial and retaliation” (italics in original).\n\nHowever, the concern runs even deeper. The question is not whether punishment, denial, and defense should or could be seen as different methods of deterrence. Rather, what is in question is the attempt to fully distinguish between deterrence by punishment and deterrence by denial through the distinction between emphasizing costs for the putative challenger (deterrence by punishment) and emphasizing the challenger's ability to attain its goal (deterrence by denial).\nWhile fear—of failure and of inability to achieve a goal—is a constitutive element of deterrence by denial, it is only part of the deterrent mechanism. It can be suggested that “costs” also play an important role in the practices of deterrence by denial. While certain scholars do acknowledge this argument (e.g. Nye 2017, 56; Brantly 2018, 35; Mazarr 2018, 6; Sawyer 2021, 111; Matania and Bachrach 2023), some see it as being of limited importance. Gross Stein and Levi (2015, 411), for example, argue that the tactics of deterrence by denial “play principally on increasing the likelihood of failure, and only indirectly on cost.”\nThe point, however, is that effective deterrence may be attained by making it clear to the putative challengers that executing the undesired activity will be costly not because of retaliation but rather because of the costs involved in executing it. These are the potential costs the putative challenger would have to invest to acquire the means and carry out the unwanted action. When the costs associated with an activity the defender tries to prevent are low, it will be difficult to convince the putative challenger to avoid using or acquiring these means. In such cases, the challenger has little to lose even if the chances of success are also low. In contrast, increasing the putative challenger's costs could result in effective deterrence by denial. The deterrer actor does not have to make the undesired activity impossible to achieve but can influence the challenger's calculations by manipulating the costs of developing the undesired activity and executing it. Libicki (2021, 192), for example, asserts that a potential challenger needs to take into account > the relationship between the resources that must be invested to mount an attack and the resources that are expended to carry out an attack. If the latter are low, then having already decided to make the necessary investments, the decision to use them is likely to be influenced by the prospect of and losses from retaliation—but if the expected costs from retaliation are themselves low, the prospect of failure is likely to be of but modest importance because mounting the attack costs little.\nAlthough some scholars acknowledge this aspect of cost—which in fact challenges the clear distinction between deterrence by punishment and deterrence by denial—this insight has only marginally contributed to the (re)conceptualization of deterrence by denial: for example, in systematically considering the various costs the putative challenger may face in light of different strategies of deterrence. In other words, the distinguishing criteria of whether the deterrent threat aims to influence the challengers' perception of costs or of chances of success are not the most effective. For both strategies of deterrence—by punishment and by denial—the costs inflicted or manipulated by the defender have a significant influence on deterrence success.\n## Mapping Deterrence Strategies To address the challenges discussed in the previous section, I offer a new categorization of deterrence to better conceptualize its diverse types. This categorization is based on two interrelated elements: the means the deterrer uses to threaten the putative challenger and the timing of their use.\nFor the first element, I distinguish between two main types of deterrent means: means based on offensive military capability and non-offensive means. Offensive AMIR LUPOVICI means are all those weapons that are used or threatened to be used to cause physical harm to an opponent. Non-offensive means are all the other means. Non-offensive means could obviously be defensive measures, but they could also be various other means that limit the damage, limit the challenger's benefits from the damage, prevent the challenger from translating the successful challenge into a meaningful achievement, or (threaten) to cause non-material costs for the putative challenger, such as through de-legitimization, shaming, and stigmatization.\nThe second element is the potential timing of the employment of the deterrent measures. Obviously, any measure needs advance preparation, development, and acquirement, as well as communication of its existence to the putative challenger. Nonetheless, a key question is whether the threat is of a measure that will be employed before or after the undesired activity occurs. Some measures are employed mainly in advance, before the unwanted activity takes place, while others are employed after the unwanted activity takes place. While issuing the threatening message occurs before the unwanted activity, it could rely on means that, if needed, will be exercised only after an unwanted activity would occur, for example, retaliation. Thus, the deterrent effect—if successful—is achieved by an opponent's understanding that these means will follow the undesired activity. Conversely, for some other deterrent measures, the deterrent effect is achieved by the putative challenger's understanding that the deterrent means are already exercised, such as in the case of walls or norm building.\nBased on this, I distinguish among four types of strategies of deterrence (see table 1).\n## Deterrence through Offensive Means Used before the Execution of the Undesired Activity Actors use offensive means in a number of ways prior to the putative unwanted activity in order to deter it.\n## Denial Capabilities Actors may threaten to use offensive means prior to the execution of the undesired activity to establish their ability to deny the effect of the potential challenge and thus signal to the putative challenger that it is a worthless endeavor. The idea behind this strategy is not just to physically eliminate the capabilities of the opponent, as evident in defensive strategies, but also to signal to the challenger that allocating resources to this goal is too costly given that the goal may not be accomplished. As Sawyer (2021, 111) argues, 4My categorization is inspired by Wirtz (2021, 127–8), who acknowledges the various ways to attain deterrence thorough retaliation, punishment, and denial and distinguishes among three ways of using offensive means for deterrence by denial: “(1) threats to launch preemptive attack or preventive war to deny the opponent military capability to launch an attack; (2) threats to defeat an attack where and when it occurs…or (3) threats to eliminate the ‘bone of contention’,” thus temporary success will not lead to a political gain. However, there are a number of differences between his discussion and my framework. First, I more directly offer a systematic way to distinguish between the offensive means by putting forward the timing of their use. Second, I contrast these offensive strategies with non-offensive ones as part of the systematic categorization. Lastly, Wirtz limits his discussion to attempts to deter territorial changes.\n5My categorization is also inspired by Smith and Talbot (2008, 56–9), who distinguish among different levels of deterrence by denial: tactical, operational, and strategic. These, respectively, concern means used to prevent the act of terrorism, means that aim to prevent terrorist capabilities, and means of preventing the goals the terrorists pursue. As such, their study overlaps with the categorization suggested in this article, as timing plays a significant role in both. Nonetheless, Smith and Talbot’s categorizations also differ considerably from mine. First, Smith and Talbot focus specifically on deterring terrorism, while I use the categorization to explore various unwanted activities. Second, and more importantly, I focus on the timing of the employment of the means the deterrer actor uses, while their classification concerns the timing of the effect of the deterrence strategy. As a result, the offered categorization allows us to better compare deterrence by denial and deterrence by punishment and thus to better grasp these two types of strategies. The suggested categorization also overlaps with Zilincik and Sweijs (2023), who distinguish between different timings—before, during, and after an attack. Nonetheless, not only does their research focus on denial strategies and not on strategies of deterrence, but as a result, they also rely on different timing and consider different categories. Furthermore, their main goal is to examine the emotional effects of different denial strategies.\n\nTable 1. Categorization of deterrence strategies\n|  Timing of use of deterrent means | The means the deterrer actor uses  |   |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|   |  Offensive measures | Non-offensive measures  |\n|  Before the execution of the undesired activity | • Denial of opponent’s capabilities\n• “Defend Forward” | • Resilience\n• De-legitimization\n• Passive defensive measures (e.g., walls)\n• “Spoofing”  |\n|  After the execution of the undesired activity | • Retaliation\n• Denying military achievements | • Active defensive systems (e.g., anti-ballistic missiles)\n• Prevention of the benefit of the undesired activity  |\nCapability denial, when defined as restricting the adversary’s access to resources required for the targeted behavior, is largely indistinguishable from an offensive strategy aimed at eliminating the adversary’s capability. However, when it is defined as strategic communication intended to alter perceptions about the availability and acquisition costs for necessary resources ... it too is a case of dissuasion.\nThis strategy is evident in threats to make a preventive or preemptive strike in a way that denies the challenger’s military option . The idea is that these strikes will not just physically prevent the challenger’s ability to perform the unwanted action but will also signal that developing such an option is a useless effort.\nSome of Israel’s operations can be understood in this context. While Israel has traditionally emphasized the strategy of deterrence by punishment , its offensive capabilities are also used for deterrence by denial . One example is the destruction in 2007 of a nuclear reactor, secretly built in the Deir ez-Zor region in eastern Syria. While the attack was carried out through a covert airstrike to reduce the chances of an escalation, its details were officially revealed a few years later . Although some scholars, such as Bar (2020, 332), see Israel’s preventive and preemptive strikes as part of establishing deterrence by punishment (and cumulative deterrence), another message is being implicitly delivered: that is, allocating resources to the goals of developing nuclear capabilities will be worthless given Israel’s ability and will to eliminate them in advance . As a result, they not only deny the challenger’s ability to acquire nuclear capabilities that would challenge Israel, but they also demonstrate the involved costs for the putative challenger to invest in such an allegedly pointless endeavor. In a similar way, the operation that started in late 2018 to destroy the tunnels Hizbullah mined from Southern parts of Lebanon into Israeli territory to invade Israel was not just to eliminate Hizbullah’s capabilities: It also had a deterrent message referring to the heavy costs and resources Hizbullah put into this project, especially given the difficulties of digging in the rocky ground of the Galilee . While Israel made no prior attempts to deter Hizbullah from establishing these tunnels, the destruction aimed, among other things, to send a deterrent message in order to affect Hizbullah’s future behavior. Again, it should be emphasized that in these cases, the\nAMIR LUPOVICI\ndeterrent mechanism concerns not just the inability to succeed but also the costs associated with committing to the challenge and preparing for it.\n## Defend Forward\nThe cyber domain provides some interesting examples of this strategy based on the advance use of offensive means. For example, while there is some ambiguity regarding whether \"defend forward\" is a strategy of deterrence (by punishment) or a departure from it , some scholars have interpreted the US reliance on defend forward as a strategy that is based on denial through offensive means . As Borghard and Lonergan (2023) argue, \"Elements of the DoD's concept of defend forward resonate with a deterrence by denial strategy, specifically those aspects that are focused on counter-cyber operations to disrupt, deny, or degrade adversary offensive capabilities and infrastructure.\" The Department of Defense Cyber Strategy  clearly states, \"We will defend forward to disrupt or halt malicious cyber activity at its source, including activity that falls below the level of armed conflict.\" The deterrent message was described by General Paul Nakasone, Commander of US Cyber Command and Director of the National Security Agency, in the February 2019 Congressional testimony, in which he argued that these efforts could increase the costs of opponents' military actions through \"craft[ing] tools and tactics to frustrate their efforts\" (in Borghard and Lonergan 2023, 561). He echoes the idea that deterrence by denial aims to influence an opponent not just by affecting the putative challenger's estimations of success, but also by increasing the costs of conducting the undesired activity.\n## Deterrence through Threatening to Use Offensive Means after the Execution of the Undesired Activity\nDeterring threats may also refer—and often do—to threats that will be implemented if the unwanted activity were to occur. In contrast to the first category, which refers to deterrent means that are operated prior to the execution of the unwanted activity, in this category the timing of using the deterrent means is after the execution of the unwanted activity—that is if the unwanted activity has already occurred.\n## Deterrence by Retaliation\nThis strategy is evident most clearly in cases of deterrence by punishment, where the defender threatens to retaliate—that is the threat is to use offensive means after an unwanted activity occurred—in order to convince a putative challenger to avoid it. The fundamental idea of this strategy is that credibly threatening a putative challenger with a retaliation would lead the challenger to avoid the undesired behavior, at least if the cost of punishment would exceed any potential gain (e.g., George and Smoke 1974; Morgan 2003, 1–25). As noted above, this idea has been widely developed in the context of nuclear deterrence, but it has also shaped strategies based on different offensive means, including, in recent years, cyber deterrence (e.g., in Wilner 2020, 252–4). The idea is that if deterrence works, actors will avoid challenging a deterrer actor because of the costs the retaliation would pose. For this reason, and acknowledging the limited availability of cyber targets that would allow deterrers to impose high costs on putative challengers, actors are advised to retaliate against cyberattacks not only with cyber means but also with traditional military kinetic means (e.g., Kugler 2009, 328; Schneider 2019).\n## Denial of Achievements\nThreatening to use offensive means after the challenger has executed the unwanted activity could also characterize situations of deterrence by denial . Most prominently, this is the idea behind conventional military\n\ndifference. Indeed, as Luttwak (1985, 3) notes, traditionally “the continuous deterrence generated by military force was generally treated as a bonus gain,” and their main goal was winning the war. Nonetheless, acquiring military capabilities had the advantage of not only providing a remedy for cases of an attack (and thus deterrence failure), but also affecting the putative challenger’s calculations about their chances of success. For this reason, Mazarr (2018, 2) argues that a useful way to estimate the effectiveness of deterrence by denial is to examine the “immediate balance of forces in the contested territory.” This clearly emphasizes that the costs the putative challenger may need to pay concern not just situations of deterrence by punishment but also situations of deterrence by denial. Obviously, attacking an opponent capable of defending will increase the costs for a putative challenger, not just because of retaliation but also because of the costs of waging the war, even if the challenger could win it. As Mazarr (2018, 6) notes, “Even if an attacker believes it might be successful in such cases, the costs of a long and painful war are a powerful preventive deterrent.”\n## Deterrence through Non-Offensive Means Used before the Execution of the Undesired Activity Non-offensive means could also be used for deterrent purposes, both prior to and following the execution of the unwanted activity of a challenger. Those used prior to the unwanted activity include a variety of strategies to threaten an opponent, such as de-legitimization, establishing resilience, and passive defense means such as establishing walls. This non-offensive deterrent means by denial work through limiting the potential damage of the undesired activity either by preventing the damage or by preventing the challenger’s ability to translate the undesired activity into meaningful damage. Exercising these means becomes part of the deterrent message the defender issues to the putative challenger.\n## De-Legitimization A number of scholars have pointed to de-legitimization as an effective means of deterrence by denial, especially against terrorism. According to Stein Gross and Levi (2015, 417), “[T]he purpose is to manipulate the social rewards of prohibited action.” In their discussion, they rely on Wilner (2011, 26), who asserts, “[T]he objective is to reduce the challenger’s probability of achieving his goals by attacking the legitimacy of the beliefs that inform his behavior.” This strategy aims to influence the putative challenger’s perception of success—their ability to translate an attack into a political victory. Nonetheless, this strategy also relates to costs the putative challenger would pay in three meaningful ways. First, this means of deterrence through de-legitimization is partly based on the political costs the challenger will pay in their domestic arena (see also Wilner 2011, 27). Second, on the top of these costs are the direct costs associated with the means required to prepare and execute the undesired activity. Third, this strategy undermines the ability of the putative challenger to mobilize support, which also affects its available resources. In this respect, this creates costs, prevents gains, and denies its (future) capabilities.⁶ Nonetheless, the connections between de-legitimization and deterrence by denial success are complicated. On the one hand, there is some evidence that successful de-legitimization does not necessarily lead to effective deterrence. For example, Turkey successfully delegitimized the PKK (Kurdistan Workers’ Party) in the early 2000s, convincing many Western countries that it is a terror organization. However, while this successful de-legitimization had some effects on the PKK’s ability to mobilize resources and support (e.g., Casier 2010), it also “resulted in recurrence of ⁶According to Stein Gross and Levi (2015, 416–7) and based on criminological research, deterrence by denial through de-legitimization can be based on three different audiences that affect the potential risks and rewards of the terrorists: formal authorities (law enforcement), social bonds, and informal control.\nold practices, including its default to violence” (Gürcan and Coşar Ünal 2018, 194). Conversely, some scholars have provided evidence to demonstrate terror organization leaders' sensitivity to legitimacy. For example, Knopf considers a message sent by the number two leader of al Qaeda, at the time, Ayman al-Zawahari, to the leader of this organization in Iraq, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, in which Zawahari “instructed Zarqawi that his methods, including indiscriminate attacks on Muslim civilians and the release of videos showing hostage beheadings, were so excessive they had become counterproductive.” According to Zawahiri, ‘the strongest weapon which the mujahadeen enjoys.... is popular support from the Muslim masses... [meaning] the mujahed movement must avoid any action that the masses do not understand or approve'”.\nDe-legitimization is also used to deter threats other than terrorism, such as deterring cyberattacks through the development of norms, in this way increasing the costs the challenger would pay with regard to different audiences. As Soesanto and Smeets argue, “the creation of norms and rules for state behaviour in cyberspace, will over time translate into a general principle of restraint, raise the reputational costs of bad behaviour”.\nThis strategy is similarly used to deter attacks in outer space. According to Mckeown and Wilner (2020), one of the means to deter an attack on US satellites is through de-legitimization, which is based on “developing ‘norms of responsible behaviour' in outer space (so as to diplomatically isolate those who would break them)”. In fact, some official reports, such as from the US Department of Defense (2014), have pointed to the need to rely on this strategy, recommending the “development of international norms of responsible behavior that enhance safety, security, and stability in space.” According to the report, advancing these norms can have “a positive effect on deterrence; even if potential adversaries are not deterred from conducting hostile or malicious acts in space, norms can help the international community identify and isolate aggressors”.\nThis example thus captures both elements of deterrence by denial and of deterrence by punishment. On the one hand, it concerns the prevention of challengers' ability to translate a successful challenge into a meaningful political achievement. In situations where such norms are strong, domestic and international audiences will prevent the putative challenger from making it a political victory. On the other hand, it also concerns deterrence by punishment, especially since the putative challenger's fear is not just of material costs associated with the punishment, but also of psychological and social costs.\nThe logic of the nuclear taboo and the emergence of normative limits to the use of nuclear weapons increase the costs of using them and thus create self-deterrence mechanisms that also overlap with both deterrence by denial and deterrence by punishment. As Tannenwald argues, while taboos affect behavior in a number of ways, some of them rely on a deterrent effect achieved by increasing domestic and international public opinion costs. According to her, the norm of the taboo has not only had a significant and direct impact on the avoidance of using nuclear weapons over the years, but it has also enhanced nuclear deterrence, and thus increased the costs decision-makers would pay if they used nuclear weapons in a first strike. In this respect, policymakers' awareness of the norm, according to Tannenwald (2007), has dissuaded them from using these weapons.\n### Establishing Resilience The demonstration of resilience is another way actors can exercise deterrence by denial with non-offensive measures prior to the execution of the undesired activity.\nDefenders demonstrate and communicate to a potential challenger that they will not be able to translate the execution of the undesired activity, even if successful, into a meaningful political benefit. Resilience can be used in various contexts in multiple domains of competition and vis-à-vis different kinds of challenging actors: state and non-state. In addition, it can be employed with different means. For example, resilience can be achieved through technological solutions, such as backup and recovery systems in case of cyberattacks. Actors can also rely on developing procedures and routines to better prepare for absorbing undesired activities such as terror attacks, for example, by educating the public about such situations. Gearson (2012, 191) suggests that “[b]y demonstrating that a society is resilient and well prepared for dislocations and shock, with intelligent design and disaster recovery procedures embedded into government and private sector behaviour, the target communities will also be reassured and confident of recovery.” Furthermore, effective use of resilience mechanisms may create substantial costs for the putative challenger, implying that investing efforts in targeting the defender is not a wise decision for allocating resources. As Nye (2017, 56) suggests regarding these means, “Attackers have limited resources and time; therefore, driving up the costs can deter attacks.”\n### Defensive Means Strategies of deterrence by denial also rely on defensive means that could be used or employed before the execution of the undesired activity (e.g. Goldgeier and Wojtowicz. 2022, 5), including walls and fortifications. Cioffi-Revilla (1999), for example, uses archeological evidence from different regions to demonstrate that deterrence by denial was used thousands of years ago. According to him, massive walls “signal significant material capacity and likely organizational know-how to implement deterrence by denial”. These walls are also used in modern times with varying degrees of success, including against armies and terror attacks and even against migrants. The intention in these cases is to deter by signaling to individuals and armies that they will not be able to achieve their desired goals or that they will need to invest substantial resources toward it. Findings from migration scholarship show that while walls decrease the number of people who cross these specific areas, the numbers often increase in other areas. This echoes the point about the interrelated effects of the costs and chances of success in executing an action a deterrer actor attempts to prevent. Lastly, passive defense measures like “civil defense” are also based on non-military means that serve deterrence by denial, such as using shelters or evacuating populations in certain scenarios. These measures are used prior to the occurrence of the unwanted activity. While such measures can also be costly for the defender, they significantly limit the potential gain a putative challenger can make from executing the unwanted activity, and thus may decrease its attractiveness.\nSome cyber defensive measures may seem similar to traditional security means: for example, (fire-)walls, which are used to harden cyber targets and defend against cyberattacks and thus could have deterrent effect. Cyber technologies provide some other unique ways to use this type of strategy, for example, by remodeling the cyber terrain. This may enhance cyber defense and thus has deterrence by denial effects.\n### Spoofing Planting dummy targets makes the execution of the unwanted activity more costly and thus can be used as a strategy of deterrence by denial. The rationale is that planting dummy targets increases the potential future efforts and costs the putative challengers need to invest since resources have to be allocated to identify the real AMIR LUPOVICI Another example is the music industry’s attempt in the early 2000s to deter the sharing of media files through streaming services such as Napster. Various measures were used to complicate access to these files and thus to deter potential users. Spoofing was one of these methods, where copyright holders uploaded corrupted files, including fake music files, that provided computer users with “static, popping, cracking noises, or silence instead of the unauthorized music file they were attempting to download”. The industry even hired some companies to distribute these fake files. The explicit aim of these attempts was to create a deterrent effect: Given the time and costs of downloading files in the early 2000s, the attractiveness of this activity was lessened by actors’ knowledge that there was a good chance the file would be corrupted. In the end, the deterrent effect was aimed to be achieved by reducing the likelihood of success of downloading the media files. Nonetheless, the strategy also emphasizes the importance of “costs” for deterrence by denial. If there were no costs to downloading the music—internet costs, time invested in searching for the files, the annoyance of downloading a corrupted file—then there would be no deterrent effect. Interestingly, as Jennings and Bossler (2020, 1038–9) note, this strategy had little deterrent effect because the corrupted files were identified and so users could avoid them.\n## Deterrence through Threatening to Use Non-Offensive Means after the Execution of the Undesired Activity Lastly, actors could threaten to use non-offensive measures after absorbing the undesired activity. Most commonly, this could be done through threatening to use defensive measures to deny the effectiveness of the challenge, for example, thorough “anti-aircraft or anti-ballistic missile systems designed to bring down the enemy offensive before any targets were reached”. Clearly, the defender needs to have these capabilities as well as to communicate them to the putative challenger to dissuade the unwanted action (see also Golov 2016, 89).\nAn effective deterrence by denial carries the message that preparing and executing the challenge would be costly because the resources allocated would not be worth it. As Sawyer (2021, 111) notes, “Tactical denial—communication about target-hardening efforts—conveys the adversary that it must adopt new tactics, which are likely to increase the cost or uncertainty of action in the short term.” Denial could be established on defensive components in such a way that “an adver 7Scholars have pointed to a number of challenges concerning this strategy: for example, the limited credibility of reliance on defensive systems for deterrence, especially given the limited “margin of error”, their costs, the challenges they create for deterrence by punishment, and the incentives they may give to a putative challenger in order to exhaust the defensive systems budget. For a review of strategic negative implications of defensive systems on deterrence, see Quackenbush (2006, 533), who nonetheless contends that these systems eventually enhance deterrence success.\nsary cannot go on the offense without incurring significant costs”. This view is part of how Katagiri (2021), who focuses on deterrence through defensive means, defines deterrence by denial. According to him, it is the “ability to deny actions and persuade the opponent that it is unlikely to attain its immediate objectives at a reasonable cost”. This means that defensive measures may increase the costs for a putative challenger to execute the attack and thus, as in deterrence by punishment, may affect not only their chance of success but also their costs of planning, developing, and executing the challenge.\nTo take a more concrete example, Israel in recent years has shifted its strategy, relying increasingly on active defense systems to cover various types of threats, including the Iron Dome missile defense batteries that aim to intercept short-range rockets and the Arrow system that aims to intercept long-range missiles. Although skeptical about how effective these defensive measures are in creating successful deterrence, Adamsky (2021, 178--81) acknowledges that the changes in the strategic environment “produced a much stronger emphasis on defense in Israeli national security, and thus somewhat expanded the role of deterrence by denial in Israel strategic thought.”\nActive defense systems are also used for deterrence by denial strategies to dissuade cyberattacks. While the question remains as to whether these defensive systems could effectively provide defense or deterrence by denial, a number of scholars suggest this at least as a theoretical option. Schneider (2019, 113), for example, argues that “cyber defense” could be achieved through “securing nodes of civilian and military networks” such as space-based satellites and optic cables. The point, however, is that while cyber infrastructures could be defended with passive means, they could also be defended by active defense measures, including kinetic means such as ballistic missiles, as part of a cross-domain deterrence.\nHowever, non-offensive means do not necessarily need to be military ones. For example, policies of deterrence to prevent immigration rely on means used after the perceived unwanted activity occurs such as detaining immigrants, preventing social benefits and work rights, and reducing access to legal due process. All these means are characterized by being employed after the unwanted action has taken place—the immigrants have already entered a country whose government aims to deter immigration. The idea behind these deterrent policies is to demonstrate to potential immigrants that they will not be able to succeed: for example, they will be unable to work in the target country. This negates the value of the costs invested in the immigration process and in the efforts to immigrate into their territories.\n## Toward a Revised Theory of Deterrence by Denial The discussion so far demonstrates that while deterrence by punishment and deterrence by denial can be contrasted if we consider them through their strategic goals, overlaps can be seen by looking at the strategies' means as well as their timing. For example, both deterrence by denial and deterrence by punishment could be established by using offensive means, even those used after the execution of the challenge. The discussion also shows that inflicting costs is a significant element not only of deterrence by punishment but also of deterrence by denial. The strategy of deterrence by denial involves mechanisms that can increase the costs for the putative challenger, including costs associated with resources to prepare for and conduct the undesired activity. Some strategies of deterrence by denial concern other kinds of costs, such as costs the actor may pay in domestic and international arenas about its legitimization, which can affect its ability (and motivation) to execute the undesired activity. Taking these elements together, and acknowledging the overlap between deterrence by punishment and deterrence by denial, opens a path to further theorize deterrence by denial. Furthermore, acknowledging the overlap may lead a more general theory of deterrence to account for both types of deterrence.\nWhile it is beyond the scope of this article to cover all the factors accounting for the success of deterrence by denial, taking steps toward this goal could prove useful to demonstrate the advantages of the suggested conceptualization when it comes to explaining deterrence success and considering the adoption of the strategy.\n### Deterrence Success—The Balance of Costs As demonstrated above, different means of both deterrence by punishment and deterrence by denial may incur costs in various ways for putative challengers. It follows then that a key concept in accounting for deterrence success (of deterrence by either punishment or denial) is the balance of costs. When the costs to the putative challenger of executing the challenge are low—because the cost of expected retaliation is low, because the costs of the means for the attack are low, because the costs of executing the attack are low, and/or because the domestic audience supports paying these costs—the challenge will be much more difficult to successfully deter. Similarly, when acquiring or using the means of deterrence is costly for the defender, it is difficult to threaten using them as deterrents (see also Matania and Bachrach 2023).\nThis was exactly the situation with Israel's reliance on defensive measures to deter Hamas rockets launched from Gaza using the Iron Dome system. The costs for Hamas were between 500 and 1,000 US dollars per Katyusha rocket, while each intercepting missile costs 50,000 and a battery of Iron Dome costs around 100 million US dollars. Although the costs for Israel in a situation without any defensive measures might be much higher given the potential damage these rockets can do, this system's deterrent effect in preventing these attacks is very limited. In fact, some have pointed out that these unbalanced costs may incentivize Hamas to challenge Israel to erode its security budget. This is why former Israeli Prime Minister, Naftali Bennet (2022), declared that Israel is developing a defense system based on laser technology: To change “[t]he economic equation... If it is possible to intercept a missile or rocket with just an electric pulse that costs a few dollars, we will have nullified the ring of fire that Iran has set up on our borders. The whole thing no longer pays off.”\nIn contrast, in other cases, the deterrer actors may be the ones who enjoy the “balance of costs.” An interesting example is provided by Lior Div, the CEO of Cybereason, a cyber security company. Although he does not refer to the concept of deterrence by denial, he clearly demonstrates this logic when discussing the SolarWinds attack. This was a serious cyberattack, likely sponsored by a foreign government, that infected numerous computers in the United States in late 2020, including nine government agencies and a hundred private companies. In an interview, Div noted that “SolarWinds attackers scanned networks to determine if Cybereason's software was installed. If they saw that it was present, they bypassed it and moved along to another network”. Given the system's past successes, the hackers did not want it to gather information on their malicious code. This is an example of deterrence by denial based on the challenger's fear that the system could effectively detect and neutralize the attack and thus render the efforts invested in the malicious code useless. More generally, while not entirely deterring the use of this attack and not using fear of retaliation, the Cybereason system effectively deterred by denial the attack on the computers on which it operated.\nAnother important factor affecting the balance of costs, and thus deterrence success, is the cost for the putative challenger of identifying relevant targets and knowing how costly it would be to execute the challenge: for example, in case of defensive missiles, how costly it would be for a putative challenger to identify areas the system cannot fully cover, or, similarly, in the case of building walls, how costly (how many resources it would take) it would be for immigrants to identify alternative routes to those blocked by walls. It could be that these latter costs are not high, as evidence shows that while walls have a deterrent effect, the number of those crossing in areas without walls increases. Another example is in the case of spoofing. As noted above, the costs of identifying the fake media files were very low, which led to deterrence failure. Nonetheless, planting dummy targets at sea seems a much more effective strategy given that many actors do not have access to measures that allow them to identify the real targets, thus significantly increasing their costs to distinguish between real and faked ones (Gutman and Rojkes Dombe 2017).\nThe cost of knowing is also affected by another factor; that is, the costs to execute the activity the defender aims to prevent. When the costs to execute the unwanted activity are very low, the costs of knowing become less important, since a putative challenger may easily challenge many possible targets. For example, as noted above, when the cost for launching rockets is low, as in the case of the rockets Hamas launches against Israel, putative challengers do not need to invest many resources into identifying alternative targets, thus indicating the limited effectiveness of deterrence by denial.\nThe costs of knowing are also relevant for deterrence by punishment. In some cases, deterrer actors, indeed, clearly state what the costs would be for executing the unwanted behavior and what would be considered as such a behavior. Nonetheless, in many other cases, the deterrent threat includes ambiguities (see Crawford 2003, 11--2) that force the putative challenger to invest resources in identifying the structure of costs. In terms of the balance of costs, this adds another layer and trade-off of costs affecting deterrence success.\nLastly, the balance of costs may also be affected by different mechanisms and means operated at different times. This is because a deterrent means may incur additional costs at times other than when they are exercised. Acknowledging the different categories presented above, which refer to different timings at which the deterrent means are exercised, may thus point to other ways to enhance the deterrent threat. For example, as discussed above, building norms is a non-offensive deterrent means used prior to the execution of the unwanted activity. Its effectiveness stems from policymakers' sensitivity to the domestic and international public opinion costs, and thus on their ability to translate the unwanted activity into a meaningful political achievement. However, while normative structures create a pre-condition for deterrence success, the deterrent effect may be enhanced by other mechanisms that could be exercised if an unwanted activity takes place, such as naming and shaming. Breaking norms inflict “a kind of social punishment on the normative transgressor. A loss of face amongst the international community is the likely outcome of such a naming and shaming exercise”. In other words, naming and shaming practices allow an actor to translate the norm into a specific deterrent threat, and thus to incur more concrete costs. Conversely, decision-makers who know that no one would translate the inappropriate behavior into costs would be less affected by the norm.\nFurthermore, these dynamics could also have future deterrent effects, even if they failed. In this respect, although exercising naming and shaming demonstrates deterrence failure, as neither the norm nor the possibility of naming and shaming dissuaded the unwanted activity, it may clarify the potential costs for future similar behavior. In addition, practicing naming and shaming may help mobilize opponents to this behavior, resulting in a future increase in the costs of the unwanted activity.\nAMIR LUPOVICI\n\n## Adoption of Deterrence Strategy\nIn addition, the overlap between deterrence by punishment and deterrence by denial could be used to elaborate on elements that affect the adoption of the strategy. The discussion above emphasizes not only the strategies the deterrer actor uses but also the means and timing. This provides a useful point of departure for asking questions about the reliance on deterrence strategies in general or about the exact type of deterrence, as well as about the specific means used for deterrence purposes. For example, cultural elements may explain actors’ reliance on non-offensive measures for deterrence. The case of Japan, given its culture and constitutional restrictions, is a key example of an actor that relies on deterrence by denial through defensive systems . As Katagiri (2021, 207) explains, in addition to extended deterrence it receives, Japan’s doctrine is based on “defensive defence, which bans offensive use of force even in wartime. It means that defensive force can only be used in the event of a foreign attack and is limited to the minimum necessary for self-defence. Since the 1970s it has informed Japan’s deterrence-by-denial posture and affected weapons programs and operations.”\nIn a similar way, cultural and social elements may explain a state’s reliance on strategies of deterrence by punishment or deterrence by denial that mainly use offensive measures. For Israel, for example, reliance on the actual use of force as part of practicing deterrence, and especially cumulative deterrence, is a formative idea . It is related not only to strategic elements, but also to cultural, social, and political ones . From this perspective, it matters little whether the strategy relies on deterrence by punishment or deterrence by denial. Rather, the important elements are the means used and the ability to employ them as part of a strategy of deterrence.\n## Conclusion\nIn this article, I offered a new way to distinguish among different types of deterrence strategies based on the means used for deterrent threats and the timing of when actors threaten to use them. I demonstrated each of the various types by considering examples from kinetic and cyber domains. I argue that using this categorization better captures the differences and overlapping of deterrence by punishment and deterrence by denial. In addition, viewing deterrence through these lenses also emphasizes that inflicting costs is a key aspect not only of deterrence by punishment but also of deterrence by denial.\nExploring these issues helps us to further theorize about deterrence by denial, whose study currently lags behind the research on deterrence by punishment. While this paper acknowledges this gap, it also offers and demonstrates a direction to close it by contextualizing the means deterrer actors use and recognizing that costs are an aspect common to both types of deterrence.\nI conclude by pointing to a broader research agenda derived from this research. First, this discussion helps us to reconsider how factors already acknowledged in deterrence scholarship may have different effects on the categories presented above. For example, scholars acknowledge the importance of communicating capabilities and intentions. Means used before defenders experience the challenge—either defensively or offensively—may communicate the threat more effectively than those employed only post-factum, as, for example, in the case of traditional deterrence\n\nby punishment. Furthermore, thinking through this lens may inspire research on other factors affecting deterrence success. Second, and along with the previous point, this research allows us to consider, categorize, and explain different strategies of deterrence. For example, in recent years scholars have pointed to the strategy of threatening to reveal the identity of a putative challenger through the notion of deterrence by detection or by accusation (e.g., Lindsay and Gartzke 2018, 192; Finnemore and Hollis 2020, 980–1; Wilner 2020, 271). The framework suggested here would locate this strategy as a non-offensive means operated after the execution of the undesired action: for example, technological means will help to identify post-factum who committed the attack, but communicating this capability in advance could have a deterrent effect. Considering this strategy in this category allows us to develop specific factors to account for its failure or success and help us to better contrast it with other strategies of deterrence.\nAlso important in further developing explanations of deterrence success, as discussed above, is to focus on costs or the balance of costs. Again, one set of questions concerns how costs—and not just costs of a retaliatory strike—could be communicated, including communicating both the ability to inflict costs and the intention to use these capabilities. Furthermore, distinguishing among different types of costs inflicted at different points of time is also a promising direction for theorizing deterrence success, including that of deterrence by denial.\nThis categorization inspires additional questions about the adoption of the strategy. For example, scholars could explore whether actors prioritize some means for deterrent purposes over others, such as in the Japanese and Israeli cases briefly discussed above. Scholars could also ask more specific questions about key concepts, such as the cult of reputation. For example, they could compare the effects of this cult on actors’ reliance on offensive and non-offensive means when they consider adopting or issuing a deterrent threat.\nFinally, on an empirical level, this framework offers a useful direction to explore cyber deterrence further. As noted above, while deterrence by denial seems a more effective strategy to address cyber security concerns, such research requires further theoretical development (e.g., Borghard and Lonergan 2023, 534-5). My research addresses this challenge by offering specific directions to explore cyber deterrence success (and its adoption). For example, the emphasis of this conceptual framework on “costs” is pertinent to exploring cyber security given the various costs involved for both the defender and the putative challenger. Likewise, cyber technologies could spark interesting debates on the distinction between offensive and non-offensive means both in thinking about deterrence success and in studying the adoption of the strategy. This is especially important given questions about what counts as offensive or violent means in the cyber domain, and thus what legitimizes a response and with what means.",

Despite its prominence, however, the scholarship on deterrence by denial stands to be developed further. It lags behind scholarship on deterrence by punishment on two points: in identifying the conditions under which the strategy works and in examining elements affecting its adoption. Deterrence by denial also carries some conceptual ambiguity since its employment takes many significantly different forms and also because it overlaps with deterrence by punishment. Despite the emphasis in current scholarship on\"inflicting costs\"as a defining element of deterrence by punishment, costs arguably also play a significant role in deterrence by denial. To address these challenges, I distinguish between deterrence strategies by focusing on two main elements: the means the deterrer actor threatens to use (offensive or non-offensive) and the timing of the threatened use of these means (before or after the unwanted activity). This offers a more nuanced distinction between deterrence strategies and better encompasses the role of inflicting costs in deterrence by denial. I suggest that this research offers a useful point of departure to further theorize about deterrence by denial, and it sets a promising research agenda that is pertinent given the growing interest in deterrence by denial, especially in its application to cyber deterrence.\nLa estrategia de disuasión por negación es ampliamente utilizada por diferentes agentes. Sin embargo, a pesar de su importancia, el conocimiento académico relativo a la disuasión por negación debe desarrollarse aún en mayor medida. El conocimiento académico relativo a la disuasión por negación se ha quedado atrasado en comparación con el conocimiento académico relativo a la disuasión por castigo en dos puntos: la identificación de las condiciones bajo las cuales funciona la estrategia y el estudio de los elementos que afectan su adopción. La disuasión por negación también conlleva cierta ambigüedad conceptual, ya que se utiliza de muchas formas, significativamente diferentes entre ellas, y también porque se solapa con la disuasión por castigo. A pesar del énfasis existente en el mundo académico actual en usar el hecho de «imponer costes» como un elemento definitorio de la disuasión por castigo, estos costes también juegan un papel importante en la disuasión por negación. Con el fin de abordar estos desafíos, hacemos una distinción entre ambas estrategias de disuasión centrándonos en dos elementos principales: los medios Lupovici, Amir.

Néanmoins, malgré son importance, elle ne fait l'objet que de peu de travaux de recherche. Elle a du retard par rapport à la recherche sur la dissuasion par la punition à deux niveaux: quand il s'agit d'identifier les conditions de fonctionnement d'une stratégie et quand il s'agit d'analyser les éléments qui ont une incidence sur son adoption. La dissuasion par le déni s'accompagne également d'une certaine ambiguïté conceptuelle, car son emploi revêt des formes très différentes et elle a tendance à recouper la dissuasion par la punition. Malgré l'accent actuel des recherches sur les « coûts infligés » comme élément définitoire de la dissuasion par la punition, ceux-ci pourraient bien aussi jouer un rôle important dans la dissuasion par le déni. Pour répondre à ces défis, je distingue les stratégies de dissuasion en me concentrant sur deux éléments principaux: les moyens que l'acteur dissuasif menace d'utiliser (offensifs ou non) et la temporalité d'application de cette menace (avant ou après l'activité indésirable). Ainsi apparaît une distinction plus nuancée des stratégies de dissuasion, qui représente plus justement le rôle des coûts infligés dans la dissuasion par le déni. Selon moi, ce travail de recherche propose un point de départ utile quand il s'agit de pousser la théorisation de la dissuasion par le déni et un programme de recherche prometteur et pertinent, étant donné l'intérêt croissant pour la dissuasion par le déni, en particulier pour son application de cyberdissuasion.\nKeywords: deterrence, deterrence by denial Palabras clave: disuasión, disuasión por negación Mots clés: dissuasion, dissuasion par le déni # Introduction A key classical distinction in deterrence scholarship is between deterrence by punishment and deterrence by denial. Suggested as early as the late 1950s, this distinction in its original formulation focuses on whether the deterrent threat emphasizes the cost for the putative challengers if they execute the undesired activity (deterrence by punishment) or puts into question the challenger's ability to achieve its goals (deterrence by denial). As Wilner and Wenger (2021, 7) explain,\"[W]hereas punishment manipulates behavior by augmenting costs, denial works by stripping away benefits... so whereas punishment deters through the fear of pain, denial deters through the fear of failure.\"This distinction has been important for the emergence of deterrence research. Given the prominence of nuclear deterrence and its impact on this research, the concept of deterrence by punishment is conspicuous in how the study emerged.\nIt is only in recent years that the concept of deterrence by denial has started to attract greater attention (e.g., Smith and Talbot 2008; Gearson 2012; Brantly 2018; Adamsky 2021; Wenger and Wilner 2021; Zilincik and Swejs 2023; Borghard and Lonergan 2023). This shift is due mainly to changes in the threat environment—the advancement of new regional and global powers on the one hand, and the grow ing role of low-level conflicts, including terrorism and cyber conflicts, on the other. These changes have clarified the need for alternatives to the dominant strategy of deterrence by punishment. For example, some studies have suggested cyber deterrence by denial as an alternative because of the challenges of successfully implementing cyber deterrence by punishment, mainly the problem of attribution. In addition, organizational competencies and technological developments, such as the advancement of better defensive measures enhance the attractiveness of the strategy of deterrence by denial (e.g. Slayton 2017, 89--90; Lilli 2021, 171; Lupovici 2021, 1687).\nI argue, however, that despite the advantages of the concept of deterrence by denial, it can be further developed theoretically and clarified conceptually. Foremost, while there is a consensus among scholars regarding key factors affecting the success of deterrence by punishment, that is, capability, credibility, and communication (e.g. Morgan 2003, 15--20), much less has been theorized about the conditions under which deterrence by denial succeeds. Likewise, the research could also be developed with regard to studying the adoption of deterrence by denial. For example, while some studies have focused on the social and cultural elements affecting the adoption of deterrence by punishment, we know much less in this regard about the adoption of deterrence by denial strategies (but see Målksoo2021).\nSecond, deterrence by denial refers to various distinct mechanisms—such as defense, resilience, denial, and prevention—grouped under one category. This ambiguity not only reveals the need to clarify and map the sub-categories of deterrence by denial, but it also aggravates the challenge in studying the success of deterrence by denial—that is, in determining whether each sub-category of deterrence by denial is successful under the same conditions. In addition, and even more challenging, is the overlap between deterrence by punishment and deterrence by denial. As I discuss below, contrary to common wisdom that emphasizes the clear distinction between deterrence by punishment and deterrence by denial, both strategies concern the sensitivity of the putative challenger to “costs.” In other words, while I agree that deterrence by denial focuses on the fear of failure, this strategy is also affected by the manipulation of actors' sensitivity to “costs.” Therefore, inflicting “costs,” while considered a key element of deterrence by punishment, provides a limited borderline between deterrence by punishment and deterrence by denial since it plays a significant role in both kinds of deterrence. Some scholars have put this idea forward: for example, Brantly (2018, 35) clearly argues that both “[d]eterrence by punishment and denial are intended to manipulate the cost-benefit analysis of an adversary.” Likewise, a number of scholars have acknowledged the importance of incurring costs for deterrence by denial (e.g. Gross Stein and Levi 2015, 411; Nye 2017, 56; Mazarr 2018, 6; Libicki 2021, 192; Sawyer 2021, 111; Matania and Bachrach 2023; Zilincik and Sweijs 2023, 261). However, rather than seeing this finding as an obstacle, I argue it is an opportunity not only to clarify this strategy but also to develop a more extensive concept of deterrence in general as well as of deterrence by denial specifically.\nTo achieve this goal, I offer a new conceptualization of deterrence based on two elements: the means used by the deterrer actor to threaten (offensive or non-offensive) and the timing of the threatened use of these means (before or after the unwanted activity occurs). This theoretical move provides a way to clarify the concept of deterrence by denial and a better way to distinguish among different types of deterrence strategies, including by punishment and by denial, and thus avoids the binary distinction between them. Furthermore, this move offers a useful point of departure to advance the research of deterrence by denial success, which lags behind the research of deterrence by punishment success (Gross Stein and Levi 2015, 411; Wilner and Wenger 2021, 7; Zilincik and Sweijs 2023, 249). For example, if we Deterrence through Inflicting Costs acknowledge that deterrence by punishment and deterrence by denial overlap (i.e., they both concern inflicting costs), we can better rely on the existing scholarship of deterrence by punishment and draw important insights from it concerning both the success and the adoption of deterrence by denial. As a result, while it is beyond the scope of this paper to fully explore deterrence success, I do aim to demonstrate the advantages of the suggested conceptualization toward this goal.\nThe article unfolds as follows. In the first section, I identify a few issues on which the research of deterrence by denial could be further developed. In the second, I suggest the new conceptualization of deterrence, based on the distinction among four different categories, and illustrate them through kinetic and cyber deterrence practices. In the third section, I consider the advantages of this conceptualization regarding the main challenges of the study of deterrence by denial. I conclude by discussing further implications for deterrence scholarship.\n## The Concept of Deterrence by Denial and its Limitations I argue that the concept of deterrence by denial could be developed further in two interrelated ways: by elaborating on the conditions under which it succeeds and is adopted and by addressing its conceptual ambiguity.\n## The Need for Further Development of Theoretical Explanations for Deterrence by Denial ### Deterrence Success In contrast to the rich scholarship of deterrence by punishment, much less is known about the conditions under which the strategy of deterrence by denial works. Scholars agree that the conditions needed for deterrence by punishment are based on defenders' capabilities, credibility, and communication; however, no such clear articulation of the conditions for deterrence by denial exists. For example, we do not fully know whether the traditional conditions for success of deterrence by punishment are relevant to deterrence by denial or whether we need to consider other conditions, nor do we know how actors deliver their threats in deterrence by denial strategies. While researchers have recently started to engage more specifically with these types of questions, the scholarship still requires more comprehensive theoretical discussion and empirical studies of these conditions. What we currently have are specific assertions about particular factors that might affect deterrence success, for example, from scholars who study conventional deterrence and focus on deterrence by denial based on military capabilities (e.g., Mearsheimer 1983, 24-30, 62-6). However, as I will further discuss below, deterrence by denial does not rely exclusively on offensive capabilities or on military means in general.\n### Deterrence Adoption Theories of deterrence by denial could also be developed through studies elaborating on how and when actors adopt this strategy. Most deterrence scholars focus on deterrence success rather than on its adoption. As Lupovici (2021) points out, diverting the focus to the adoption of the strategy might be useful, especially when details about deterrence success are limited or difficult to attain. Scholars have already started to explore two main elements that affect the adoption of the strategy: technological changes and cultural and social elements.\n\nAMIR LUPOVICI However, these studies have mainly been in the context of deterrence by punishment. For example, some scholars have pointed to how technological changes eased the development and adoption of deterrence by punishment during the Cold War. In a similar way, scholars have shown how social elements such as culture, identity, and routines shape the adoption and implementation of practices of deterrence by punishment in different contexts. However, similar questions could be asked about deterrence by denial (e.g., Målksoo 2021): for example, whether deterrence by denial allows actors to maintain their prestige and status in the same manner as deterrence through punishment and retaliation.\n## Conceptual Ambiguity The challenge of conceptual ambiguity arises from the various kinds of means of employing the strategy of deterrence by denial and from the difficulty of clearly distinguishing between deterrence by denial and deterrence by punishment.\n## Multiple Strategies While scholars who explored deterrence by denial originally tended to regard it as based primarily on defensive measures (e.g., Buzan 1987, 135), recent studies agree that deterrence by denial can be achieved in various ways. As Borghard and Lonergan (2023, 541) argue, “While defense can be one mechanism that contributes to deterrence by denial, it is not the only—or even primary—means of achieving denial.” More recent scholarship has also pointed to different means to practice deterrence by denial, such as de-legitimization, resilience, and law enforcement activities; as well as long-term effects based on repeated failures at both strategic and tactical levels.\nAlthough it is important to acknowledge the different means through which actors can operate deterrence by denial, a more comprehensive framework would provide a systematic way to categorize the various types of deterrence and thus to effectively compare and contrast among strategies of deterrence by denial and deterrence by punishment. This would also be important given the need to elucidate the conditions under which this strategy works (or is adopted). In other words, it would help to show whether different conditions are necessary for success for different sub-categories of deterrence by denial.\n## Overlap of “Costs” As Wilner and Wenger (2021, 7) observe, scholars suggest that the effect of deterrence by punishment is achieved by fear of retaliation, and the deterrent effect of deterrence by denial is achieved by fear of failure (see also von Hlatky 2015, 4). While they aptly summarize the scholarship, I suggest that the distinction between deterrence by punishment and deterrence by denial is not as clear as many scholars assume.\nFirst, as Buzan (1987, 135), for example, has noted, “[I]n military terms, denial and defense have virtually identical meanings. Those who treat deterrence and defence as alternatives are assuming that deterrence is likewise synonymous with retaliation.” According to Buzan (1987, 136), since the purpose of deterrence is to prevent “unwanted actions before they occur... [L]ogically, therefore the concept of deterrence encompasses both denial and retaliation” (italics in original).\n\nHowever, the concern runs even deeper. The question is not whether punishment, denial, and defense should or could be seen as different methods of deterrence. Rather, what is in question is the attempt to fully distinguish between deterrence by punishment and deterrence by denial through the distinction between emphasizing costs for the putative challenger (deterrence by punishment) and emphasizing the challenger's ability to attain its goal (deterrence by denial).\nWhile fear—of failure and of inability to achieve a goal—is a constitutive element of deterrence by denial, it is only part of the deterrent mechanism. It can be suggested that “costs” also play an important role in the practices of deterrence by denial. While certain scholars do acknowledge this argument (e.g. Nye 2017, 56; Brantly 2018, 35; Mazarr 2018, 6; Sawyer 2021, 111; Matania and Bachrach 2023), some see it as being of limited importance. Gross Stein and Levi (2015, 411), for example, argue that the tactics of deterrence by denial “play principally on increasing the likelihood of failure, and only indirectly on cost.”\nThe point, however, is that effective deterrence may be attained by making it clear to the putative challengers that executing the undesired activity will be costly not because of retaliation but rather because of the costs involved in executing it. These are the potential costs the putative challenger would have to invest to acquire the means and carry out the unwanted action. When the costs associated with an activity the defender tries to prevent are low, it will be difficult to convince the putative challenger to avoid using or acquiring these means. In such cases, the challenger has little to lose even if the chances of success are also low. In contrast, increasing the putative challenger's costs could result in effective deterrence by denial. The deterrer actor does not have to make the undesired activity impossible to achieve but can influence the challenger's calculations by manipulating the costs of developing the undesired activity and executing it. Libicki (2021, 192), for example, asserts that a potential challenger needs to take into account > the relationship between the resources that must be invested to mount an attack and the resources that are expended to carry out an attack. If the latter are low, then having already decided to make the necessary investments, the decision to use them is likely to be influenced by the prospect of and losses from retaliation—but if the expected costs from retaliation are themselves low, the prospect of failure is likely to be of but modest importance because mounting the attack costs little.\nAlthough some scholars acknowledge this aspect of cost—which in fact challenges the clear distinction between deterrence by punishment and deterrence by denial—this insight has only marginally contributed to the (re)conceptualization of deterrence by denial: for example, in systematically considering the various costs the putative challenger may face in light of different strategies of deterrence. In other words, the distinguishing criteria of whether the deterrent threat aims to influence the challengers' perception of costs or of chances of success are not the most effective. For both strategies of deterrence—by punishment and by denial—the costs inflicted or manipulated by the defender have a significant influence on deterrence success.\n## Mapping Deterrence Strategies To address the challenges discussed in the previous section, I offer a new categorization of deterrence to better conceptualize its diverse types. This categorization is based on two interrelated elements: the means the deterrer uses to threaten the putative challenger and the timing of their use.\nFor the first element, I distinguish between two main types of deterrent means: means based on offensive military capability and non-offensive means. Offensive AMIR LUPOVICI means are all those weapons that are used or threatened to be used to cause physical harm to an opponent. Non-offensive means are all the other means. Non-offensive means could obviously be defensive measures, but they could also be various other means that limit the damage, limit the challenger's benefits from the damage, prevent the challenger from translating the successful challenge into a meaningful achievement, or (threaten) to cause non-material costs for the putative challenger, such as through de-legitimization, shaming, and stigmatization.\nThe second element is the potential timing of the employment of the deterrent measures. Obviously, any measure needs advance preparation, development, and acquirement, as well as communication of its existence to the putative challenger. Nonetheless, a key question is whether the threat is of a measure that will be employed before or after the undesired activity occurs. Some measures are employed mainly in advance, before the unwanted activity takes place, while others are employed after the unwanted activity takes place. While issuing the threatening message occurs before the unwanted activity, it could rely on means that, if needed, will be exercised only after an unwanted activity would occur, for example, retaliation. Thus, the deterrent effect—if successful—is achieved by an opponent's understanding that these means will follow the undesired activity. Conversely, for some other deterrent measures, the deterrent effect is achieved by the putative challenger's understanding that the deterrent means are already exercised, such as in the case of walls or norm building.\nBased on this, I distinguish among four types of strategies of deterrence (see table 1).\n## Deterrence through Offensive Means Used before the Execution of the Undesired Activity Actors use offensive means in a number of ways prior to the putative unwanted activity in order to deter it.\n## Denial Capabilities Actors may threaten to use offensive means prior to the execution of the undesired activity to establish their ability to deny the effect of the potential challenge and thus signal to the putative challenger that it is a worthless endeavor. The idea behind this strategy is not just to physically eliminate the capabilities of the opponent, as evident in defensive strategies, but also to signal to the challenger that allocating resources to this goal is too costly given that the goal may not be accomplished. As Sawyer (2021, 111) argues, 4My categorization is inspired by Wirtz (2021, 127–8), who acknowledges the various ways to attain deterrence thorough retaliation, punishment, and denial and distinguishes among three ways of using offensive means for deterrence by denial: “(1) threats to launch preemptive attack or preventive war to deny the opponent military capability to launch an attack; (2) threats to defeat an attack where and when it occurs…or (3) threats to eliminate the ‘bone of contention’,” thus temporary success will not lead to a political gain. However, there are a number of differences between his discussion and my framework. First, I more directly offer a systematic way to distinguish between the offensive means by putting forward the timing of their use. Second, I contrast these offensive strategies with non-offensive ones as part of the systematic categorization. Lastly, Wirtz limits his discussion to attempts to deter territorial changes.\n5My categorization is also inspired by Smith and Talbot (2008, 56–9), who distinguish among different levels of deterrence by denial: tactical, operational, and strategic. These, respectively, concern means used to prevent the act of terrorism, means that aim to prevent terrorist capabilities, and means of preventing the goals the terrorists pursue. As such, their study overlaps with the categorization suggested in this article, as timing plays a significant role in both. Nonetheless, Smith and Talbot’s categorizations also differ considerably from mine. First, Smith and Talbot focus specifically on deterring terrorism, while I use the categorization to explore various unwanted activities. Second, and more importantly, I focus on the timing of the employment of the means the deterrer actor uses, while their classification concerns the timing of the effect of the deterrence strategy. As a result, the offered categorization allows us to better compare deterrence by denial and deterrence by punishment and thus to better grasp these two types of strategies. The suggested categorization also overlaps with Zilincik and Sweijs (2023), who distinguish between different timings—before, during, and after an attack. Nonetheless, not only does their research focus on denial strategies and not on strategies of deterrence, but as a result, they also rely on different timing and consider different categories. Furthermore, their main goal is to examine the emotional effects of different denial strategies.\n\nTable 1. Categorization of deterrence strategies\n|  Timing of use of deterrent means | The means the deterrer actor uses  |   |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|   |  Offensive measures | Non-offensive measures  |\n|  Before the execution of the undesired activity | • Denial of opponent’s capabilities\n• “Defend Forward” | • Resilience\n• De-legitimization\n• Passive defensive measures (e.g., walls)\n• “Spoofing”  |\n|  After the execution of the undesired activity | • Retaliation\n• Denying military achievements | • Active defensive systems (e.g., anti-ballistic missiles)\n• Prevention of the benefit of the undesired activity  |\nCapability denial, when defined as restricting the adversary’s access to resources required for the targeted behavior, is largely indistinguishable from an offensive strategy aimed at eliminating the adversary’s capability. However, when it is defined as strategic communication intended to alter perceptions about the availability and acquisition costs for necessary resources ... it too is a case of dissuasion.\nThis strategy is evident in threats to make a preventive or preemptive strike in a way that denies the challenger’s military option . The idea is that these strikes will not just physically prevent the challenger’s ability to perform the unwanted action but will also signal that developing such an option is a useless effort.\nSome of Israel’s operations can be understood in this context. While Israel has traditionally emphasized the strategy of deterrence by punishment , its offensive capabilities are also used for deterrence by denial . One example is the destruction in 2007 of a nuclear reactor, secretly built in the Deir ez-Zor region in eastern Syria. While the attack was carried out through a covert airstrike to reduce the chances of an escalation, its details were officially revealed a few years later . Although some scholars, such as Bar (2020, 332), see Israel’s preventive and preemptive strikes as part of establishing deterrence by punishment (and cumulative deterrence), another message is being implicitly delivered: that is, allocating resources to the goals of developing nuclear capabilities will be worthless given Israel’s ability and will to eliminate them in advance . As a result, they not only deny the challenger’s ability to acquire nuclear capabilities that would challenge Israel, but they also demonstrate the involved costs for the putative challenger to invest in such an allegedly pointless endeavor. In a similar way, the operation that started in late 2018 to destroy the tunnels Hizbullah mined from Southern parts of Lebanon into Israeli territory to invade Israel was not just to eliminate Hizbullah’s capabilities: It also had a deterrent message referring to the heavy costs and resources Hizbullah put into this project, especially given the difficulties of digging in the rocky ground of the Galilee . While Israel made no prior attempts to deter Hizbullah from establishing these tunnels, the destruction aimed, among other things, to send a deterrent message in order to affect Hizbullah’s future behavior. Again, it should be emphasized that in these cases, the\nAMIR LUPOVICI\ndeterrent mechanism concerns not just the inability to succeed but also the costs associated with committing to the challenge and preparing for it.\n## Defend Forward\nThe cyber domain provides some interesting examples of this strategy based on the advance use of offensive means. For example, while there is some ambiguity regarding whether \"defend forward\" is a strategy of deterrence (by punishment) or a departure from it , some scholars have interpreted the US reliance on defend forward as a strategy that is based on denial through offensive means . As Borghard and Lonergan (2023) argue, \"Elements of the DoD's concept of defend forward resonate with a deterrence by denial strategy, specifically those aspects that are focused on counter-cyber operations to disrupt, deny, or degrade adversary offensive capabilities and infrastructure.\" The Department of Defense Cyber Strategy  clearly states, \"We will defend forward to disrupt or halt malicious cyber activity at its source, including activity that falls below the level of armed conflict.\" The deterrent message was described by General Paul Nakasone, Commander of US Cyber Command and Director of the National Security Agency, in the February 2019 Congressional testimony, in which he argued that these efforts could increase the costs of opponents' military actions through \"craft[ing] tools and tactics to frustrate their efforts\" (in Borghard and Lonergan 2023, 561). He echoes the idea that deterrence by denial aims to influence an opponent not just by affecting the putative challenger's estimations of success, but also by increasing the costs of conducting the undesired activity.\n## Deterrence through Threatening to Use Offensive Means after the Execution of the Undesired Activity\nDeterring threats may also refer—and often do—to threats that will be implemented if the unwanted activity were to occur. In contrast to the first category, which refers to deterrent means that are operated prior to the execution of the unwanted activity, in this category the timing of using the deterrent means is after the execution of the unwanted activity—that is if the unwanted activity has already occurred.\n## Deterrence by Retaliation\nThis strategy is evident most clearly in cases of deterrence by punishment, where the defender threatens to retaliate—that is the threat is to use offensive means after an unwanted activity occurred—in order to convince a putative challenger to avoid it. The fundamental idea of this strategy is that credibly threatening a putative challenger with a retaliation would lead the challenger to avoid the undesired behavior, at least if the cost of punishment would exceed any potential gain (e.g., George and Smoke 1974; Morgan 2003, 1–25). As noted above, this idea has been widely developed in the context of nuclear deterrence, but it has also shaped strategies based on different offensive means, including, in recent years, cyber deterrence (e.g., in Wilner 2020, 252–4). The idea is that if deterrence works, actors will avoid challenging a deterrer actor because of the costs the retaliation would pose. For this reason, and acknowledging the limited availability of cyber targets that would allow deterrers to impose high costs on putative challengers, actors are advised to retaliate against cyberattacks not only with cyber means but also with traditional military kinetic means (e.g., Kugler 2009, 328; Schneider 2019).\n## Denial of Achievements\nThreatening to use offensive means after the challenger has executed the unwanted activity could also characterize situations of deterrence by denial . Most prominently, this is the idea behind conventional military\n\ndifference. Indeed, as Luttwak (1985, 3) notes, traditionally “the continuous deterrence generated by military force was generally treated as a bonus gain,” and their main goal was winning the war. Nonetheless, acquiring military capabilities had the advantage of not only providing a remedy for cases of an attack (and thus deterrence failure), but also affecting the putative challenger’s calculations about their chances of success. For this reason, Mazarr (2018, 2) argues that a useful way to estimate the effectiveness of deterrence by denial is to examine the “immediate balance of forces in the contested territory.” This clearly emphasizes that the costs the putative challenger may need to pay concern not just situations of deterrence by punishment but also situations of deterrence by denial. Obviously, attacking an opponent capable of defending will increase the costs for a putative challenger, not just because of retaliation but also because of the costs of waging the war, even if the challenger could win it. As Mazarr (2018, 6) notes, “Even if an attacker believes it might be successful in such cases, the costs of a long and painful war are a powerful preventive deterrent.”\n## Deterrence through Non-Offensive Means Used before the Execution of the Undesired Activity Non-offensive means could also be used for deterrent purposes, both prior to and following the execution of the unwanted activity of a challenger. Those used prior to the unwanted activity include a variety of strategies to threaten an opponent, such as de-legitimization, establishing resilience, and passive defense means such as establishing walls. This non-offensive deterrent means by denial work through limiting the potential damage of the undesired activity either by preventing the damage or by preventing the challenger’s ability to translate the undesired activity into meaningful damage. Exercising these means becomes part of the deterrent message the defender issues to the putative challenger.\n## De-Legitimization A number of scholars have pointed to de-legitimization as an effective means of deterrence by denial, especially against terrorism. According to Stein Gross and Levi (2015, 417), “[T]he purpose is to manipulate the social rewards of prohibited action.” In their discussion, they rely on Wilner (2011, 26), who asserts, “[T]he objective is to reduce the challenger’s probability of achieving his goals by attacking the legitimacy of the beliefs that inform his behavior.” This strategy aims to influence the putative challenger’s perception of success—their ability to translate an attack into a political victory. Nonetheless, this strategy also relates to costs the putative challenger would pay in three meaningful ways. First, this means of deterrence through de-legitimization is partly based on the political costs the challenger will pay in their domestic arena (see also Wilner 2011, 27). Second, on the top of these costs are the direct costs associated with the means required to prepare and execute the undesired activity. Third, this strategy undermines the ability of the putative challenger to mobilize support, which also affects its available resources. In this respect, this creates costs, prevents gains, and denies its (future) capabilities.⁶ Nonetheless, the connections between de-legitimization and deterrence by denial success are complicated. On the one hand, there is some evidence that successful de-legitimization does not necessarily lead to effective deterrence. For example, Turkey successfully delegitimized the PKK (Kurdistan Workers’ Party) in the early 2000s, convincing many Western countries that it is a terror organization. However, while this successful de-legitimization had some effects on the PKK’s ability to mobilize resources and support (e.g., Casier 2010), it also “resulted in recurrence of ⁶According to Stein Gross and Levi (2015, 416–7) and based on criminological research, deterrence by denial through de-legitimization can be based on three different audiences that affect the potential risks and rewards of the terrorists: formal authorities (law enforcement), social bonds, and informal control.\nold practices, including its default to violence” (Gürcan and Coşar Ünal 2018, 194). Conversely, some scholars have provided evidence to demonstrate terror organization leaders' sensitivity to legitimacy. For example, Knopf considers a message sent by the number two leader of al Qaeda, at the time, Ayman al-Zawahari, to the leader of this organization in Iraq, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, in which Zawahari “instructed Zarqawi that his methods, including indiscriminate attacks on Muslim civilians and the release of videos showing hostage beheadings, were so excessive they had become counterproductive.” According to Zawahiri, ‘the strongest weapon which the mujahadeen enjoys.... is popular support from the Muslim masses... [meaning] the mujahed movement must avoid any action that the masses do not understand or approve'”.\nDe-legitimization is also used to deter threats other than terrorism, such as deterring cyberattacks through the development of norms, in this way increasing the costs the challenger would pay with regard to different audiences. As Soesanto and Smeets argue, “the creation of norms and rules for state behaviour in cyberspace, will over time translate into a general principle of restraint, raise the reputational costs of bad behaviour”.\nThis strategy is similarly used to deter attacks in outer space. According to Mckeown and Wilner (2020), one of the means to deter an attack on US satellites is through de-legitimization, which is based on “developing ‘norms of responsible behaviour' in outer space (so as to diplomatically isolate those who would break them)”. In fact, some official reports, such as from the US Department of Defense (2014), have pointed to the need to rely on this strategy, recommending the “development of international norms of responsible behavior that enhance safety, security, and stability in space.” According to the report, advancing these norms can have “a positive effect on deterrence; even if potential adversaries are not deterred from conducting hostile or malicious acts in space, norms can help the international community identify and isolate aggressors”.\nThis example thus captures both elements of deterrence by denial and of deterrence by punishment. On the one hand, it concerns the prevention of challengers' ability to translate a successful challenge into a meaningful political achievement. In situations where such norms are strong, domestic and international audiences will prevent the putative challenger from making it a political victory. On the other hand, it also concerns deterrence by punishment, especially since the putative challenger's fear is not just of material costs associated with the punishment, but also of psychological and social costs.\nThe logic of the nuclear taboo and the emergence of normative limits to the use of nuclear weapons increase the costs of using them and thus create self-deterrence mechanisms that also overlap with both deterrence by denial and deterrence by punishment. As Tannenwald argues, while taboos affect behavior in a number of ways, some of them rely on a deterrent effect achieved by increasing domestic and international public opinion costs. According to her, the norm of the taboo has not only had a significant and direct impact on the avoidance of using nuclear weapons over the years, but it has also enhanced nuclear deterrence, and thus increased the costs decision-makers would pay if they used nuclear weapons in a first strike. In this respect, policymakers' awareness of the norm, according to Tannenwald (2007), has dissuaded them from using these weapons.\n### Establishing Resilience The demonstration of resilience is another way actors can exercise deterrence by denial with non-offensive measures prior to the execution of the undesired activity.\nDefenders demonstrate and communicate to a potential challenger that they will not be able to translate the execution of the undesired activity, even if successful, into a meaningful political benefit. Resilience can be used in various contexts in multiple domains of competition and vis-à-vis different kinds of challenging actors: state and non-state. In addition, it can be employed with different means. For example, resilience can be achieved through technological solutions, such as backup and recovery systems in case of cyberattacks. Actors can also rely on developing procedures and routines to better prepare for absorbing undesired activities such as terror attacks, for example, by educating the public about such situations. Gearson (2012, 191) suggests that “[b]y demonstrating that a society is resilient and well prepared for dislocations and shock, with intelligent design and disaster recovery procedures embedded into government and private sector behaviour, the target communities will also be reassured and confident of recovery.” Furthermore, effective use of resilience mechanisms may create substantial costs for the putative challenger, implying that investing efforts in targeting the defender is not a wise decision for allocating resources. As Nye (2017, 56) suggests regarding these means, “Attackers have limited resources and time; therefore, driving up the costs can deter attacks.”\n### Defensive Means Strategies of deterrence by denial also rely on defensive means that could be used or employed before the execution of the undesired activity (e.g. Goldgeier and Wojtowicz. 2022, 5), including walls and fortifications. Cioffi-Revilla (1999), for example, uses archeological evidence from different regions to demonstrate that deterrence by denial was used thousands of years ago. According to him, massive walls “signal significant material capacity and likely organizational know-how to implement deterrence by denial”. These walls are also used in modern times with varying degrees of success, including against armies and terror attacks and even against migrants. The intention in these cases is to deter by signaling to individuals and armies that they will not be able to achieve their desired goals or that they will need to invest substantial resources toward it. Findings from migration scholarship show that while walls decrease the number of people who cross these specific areas, the numbers often increase in other areas. This echoes the point about the interrelated effects of the costs and chances of success in executing an action a deterrer actor attempts to prevent. Lastly, passive defense measures like “civil defense” are also based on non-military means that serve deterrence by denial, such as using shelters or evacuating populations in certain scenarios. These measures are used prior to the occurrence of the unwanted activity. While such measures can also be costly for the defender, they significantly limit the potential gain a putative challenger can make from executing the unwanted activity, and thus may decrease its attractiveness.\nSome cyber defensive measures may seem similar to traditional security means: for example, (fire-)walls, which are used to harden cyber targets and defend against cyberattacks and thus could have deterrent effect. Cyber technologies provide some other unique ways to use this type of strategy, for example, by remodeling the cyber terrain. This may enhance cyber defense and thus has deterrence by denial effects.\n### Spoofing Planting dummy targets makes the execution of the unwanted activity more costly and thus can be used as a strategy of deterrence by denial. The rationale is that planting dummy targets increases the potential future efforts and costs the putative challengers need to invest since resources have to be allocated to identify the real AMIR LUPOVICI Another example is the music industry’s attempt in the early 2000s to deter the sharing of media files through streaming services such as Napster. Various measures were used to complicate access to these files and thus to deter potential users. Spoofing was one of these methods, where copyright holders uploaded corrupted files, including fake music files, that provided computer users with “static, popping, cracking noises, or silence instead of the unauthorized music file they were attempting to download”. The industry even hired some companies to distribute these fake files. The explicit aim of these attempts was to create a deterrent effect: Given the time and costs of downloading files in the early 2000s, the attractiveness of this activity was lessened by actors’ knowledge that there was a good chance the file would be corrupted. In the end, the deterrent effect was aimed to be achieved by reducing the likelihood of success of downloading the media files. Nonetheless, the strategy also emphasizes the importance of “costs” for deterrence by denial. If there were no costs to downloading the music—internet costs, time invested in searching for the files, the annoyance of downloading a corrupted file—then there would be no deterrent effect. Interestingly, as Jennings and Bossler (2020, 1038–9) note, this strategy had little deterrent effect because the corrupted files were identified and so users could avoid them.\n## Deterrence through Threatening to Use Non-Offensive Means after the Execution of the Undesired Activity Lastly, actors could threaten to use non-offensive measures after absorbing the undesired activity. Most commonly, this could be done through threatening to use defensive measures to deny the effectiveness of the challenge, for example, thorough “anti-aircraft or anti-ballistic missile systems designed to bring down the enemy offensive before any targets were reached”. Clearly, the defender needs to have these capabilities as well as to communicate them to the putative challenger to dissuade the unwanted action (see also Golov 2016, 89).\nAn effective deterrence by denial carries the message that preparing and executing the challenge would be costly because the resources allocated would not be worth it. As Sawyer (2021, 111) notes, “Tactical denial—communication about target-hardening efforts—conveys the adversary that it must adopt new tactics, which are likely to increase the cost or uncertainty of action in the short term.” Denial could be established on defensive components in such a way that “an adver 7Scholars have pointed to a number of challenges concerning this strategy: for example, the limited credibility of reliance on defensive systems for deterrence, especially given the limited “margin of error”, their costs, the challenges they create for deterrence by punishment, and the incentives they may give to a putative challenger in order to exhaust the defensive systems budget. For a review of strategic negative implications of defensive systems on deterrence, see Quackenbush (2006, 533), who nonetheless contends that these systems eventually enhance deterrence success.\nsary cannot go on the offense without incurring significant costs”. This view is part of how Katagiri (2021), who focuses on deterrence through defensive means, defines deterrence by denial. According to him, it is the “ability to deny actions and persuade the opponent that it is unlikely to attain its immediate objectives at a reasonable cost”. This means that defensive measures may increase the costs for a putative challenger to execute the attack and thus, as in deterrence by punishment, may affect not only their chance of success but also their costs of planning, developing, and executing the challenge.\nTo take a more concrete example, Israel in recent years has shifted its strategy, relying increasingly on active defense systems to cover various types of threats, including the Iron Dome missile defense batteries that aim to intercept short-range rockets and the Arrow system that aims to intercept long-range missiles. Although skeptical about how effective these defensive measures are in creating successful deterrence, Adamsky (2021, 178--81) acknowledges that the changes in the strategic environment “produced a much stronger emphasis on defense in Israeli national security, and thus somewhat expanded the role of deterrence by denial in Israel strategic thought.”\nActive defense systems are also used for deterrence by denial strategies to dissuade cyberattacks. While the question remains as to whether these defensive systems could effectively provide defense or deterrence by denial, a number of scholars suggest this at least as a theoretical option. Schneider (2019, 113), for example, argues that “cyber defense” could be achieved through “securing nodes of civilian and military networks” such as space-based satellites and optic cables. The point, however, is that while cyber infrastructures could be defended with passive means, they could also be defended by active defense measures, including kinetic means such as ballistic missiles, as part of a cross-domain deterrence.\nHowever, non-offensive means do not necessarily need to be military ones. For example, policies of deterrence to prevent immigration rely on means used after the perceived unwanted activity occurs such as detaining immigrants, preventing social benefits and work rights, and reducing access to legal due process. All these means are characterized by being employed after the unwanted action has taken place—the immigrants have already entered a country whose government aims to deter immigration. The idea behind these deterrent policies is to demonstrate to potential immigrants that they will not be able to succeed: for example, they will be unable to work in the target country. This negates the value of the costs invested in the immigration process and in the efforts to immigrate into their territories.\n## Toward a Revised Theory of Deterrence by Denial The discussion so far demonstrates that while deterrence by punishment and deterrence by denial can be contrasted if we consider them through their strategic goals, overlaps can be seen by looking at the strategies' means as well as their timing. For example, both deterrence by denial and deterrence by punishment could be established by using offensive means, even those used after the execution of the challenge. The discussion also shows that inflicting costs is a significant element not only of deterrence by punishment but also of deterrence by denial. The strategy of deterrence by denial involves mechanisms that can increase the costs for the putative challenger, including costs associated with resources to prepare for and conduct the undesired activity. Some strategies of deterrence by denial concern other kinds of costs, such as costs the actor may pay in domestic and international arenas about its legitimization, which can affect its ability (and motivation) to execute the undesired activity. Taking these elements together, and acknowledging the overlap between deterrence by punishment and deterrence by denial, opens a path to further theorize deterrence by denial. Furthermore, acknowledging the overlap may lead a more general theory of deterrence to account for both types of deterrence.\nWhile it is beyond the scope of this article to cover all the factors accounting for the success of deterrence by denial, taking steps toward this goal could prove useful to demonstrate the advantages of the suggested conceptualization when it comes to explaining deterrence success and considering the adoption of the strategy.\n### Deterrence Success—The Balance of Costs As demonstrated above, different means of both deterrence by punishment and deterrence by denial may incur costs in various ways for putative challengers. It follows then that a key concept in accounting for deterrence success (of deterrence by either punishment or denial) is the balance of costs. When the costs to the putative challenger of executing the challenge are low—because the cost of expected retaliation is low, because the costs of the means for the attack are low, because the costs of executing the attack are low, and/or because the domestic audience supports paying these costs—the challenge will be much more difficult to successfully deter. Similarly, when acquiring or using the means of deterrence is costly for the defender, it is difficult to threaten using them as deterrents (see also Matania and Bachrach 2023).\nThis was exactly the situation with Israel's reliance on defensive measures to deter Hamas rockets launched from Gaza using the Iron Dome system. The costs for Hamas were between 500 and 1,000 US dollars per Katyusha rocket, while each intercepting missile costs 50,000 and a battery of Iron Dome costs around 100 million US dollars. Although the costs for Israel in a situation without any defensive measures might be much higher given the potential damage these rockets can do, this system's deterrent effect in preventing these attacks is very limited. In fact, some have pointed out that these unbalanced costs may incentivize Hamas to challenge Israel to erode its security budget. This is why former Israeli Prime Minister, Naftali Bennet (2022), declared that Israel is developing a defense system based on laser technology: To change “[t]he economic equation... If it is possible to intercept a missile or rocket with just an electric pulse that costs a few dollars, we will have nullified the ring of fire that Iran has set up on our borders. The whole thing no longer pays off.”\nIn contrast, in other cases, the deterrer actors may be the ones who enjoy the “balance of costs.” An interesting example is provided by Lior Div, the CEO of Cybereason, a cyber security company. Although he does not refer to the concept of deterrence by denial, he clearly demonstrates this logic when discussing the SolarWinds attack. This was a serious cyberattack, likely sponsored by a foreign government, that infected numerous computers in the United States in late 2020, including nine government agencies and a hundred private companies. In an interview, Div noted that “SolarWinds attackers scanned networks to determine if Cybereason's software was installed. If they saw that it was present, they bypassed it and moved along to another network”. Given the system's past successes, the hackers did not want it to gather information on their malicious code. This is an example of deterrence by denial based on the challenger's fear that the system could effectively detect and neutralize the attack and thus render the efforts invested in the malicious code useless. More generally, while not entirely deterring the use of this attack and not using fear of retaliation, the Cybereason system effectively deterred by denial the attack on the computers on which it operated.\nAnother important factor affecting the balance of costs, and thus deterrence success, is the cost for the putative challenger of identifying relevant targets and knowing how costly it would be to execute the challenge: for example, in case of defensive missiles, how costly it would be for a putative challenger to identify areas the system cannot fully cover, or, similarly, in the case of building walls, how costly (how many resources it would take) it would be for immigrants to identify alternative routes to those blocked by walls. It could be that these latter costs are not high, as evidence shows that while walls have a deterrent effect, the number of those crossing in areas without walls increases. Another example is in the case of spoofing. As noted above, the costs of identifying the fake media files were very low, which led to deterrence failure. Nonetheless, planting dummy targets at sea seems a much more effective strategy given that many actors do not have access to measures that allow them to identify the real targets, thus significantly increasing their costs to distinguish between real and faked ones (Gutman and Rojkes Dombe 2017).\nThe cost of knowing is also affected by another factor; that is, the costs to execute the activity the defender aims to prevent. When the costs to execute the unwanted activity are very low, the costs of knowing become less important, since a putative challenger may easily challenge many possible targets. For example, as noted above, when the cost for launching rockets is low, as in the case of the rockets Hamas launches against Israel, putative challengers do not need to invest many resources into identifying alternative targets, thus indicating the limited effectiveness of deterrence by denial.\nThe costs of knowing are also relevant for deterrence by punishment. In some cases, deterrer actors, indeed, clearly state what the costs would be for executing the unwanted behavior and what would be considered as such a behavior. Nonetheless, in many other cases, the deterrent threat includes ambiguities (see Crawford 2003, 11--2) that force the putative challenger to invest resources in identifying the structure of costs. In terms of the balance of costs, this adds another layer and trade-off of costs affecting deterrence success.\nLastly, the balance of costs may also be affected by different mechanisms and means operated at different times. This is because a deterrent means may incur additional costs at times other than when they are exercised. Acknowledging the different categories presented above, which refer to different timings at which the deterrent means are exercised, may thus point to other ways to enhance the deterrent threat. For example, as discussed above, building norms is a non-offensive deterrent means used prior to the execution of the unwanted activity. Its effectiveness stems from policymakers' sensitivity to the domestic and international public opinion costs, and thus on their ability to translate the unwanted activity into a meaningful political achievement. However, while normative structures create a pre-condition for deterrence success, the deterrent effect may be enhanced by other mechanisms that could be exercised if an unwanted activity takes place, such as naming and shaming. Breaking norms inflict “a kind of social punishment on the normative transgressor. A loss of face amongst the international community is the likely outcome of such a naming and shaming exercise”. In other words, naming and shaming practices allow an actor to translate the norm into a specific deterrent threat, and thus to incur more concrete costs. Conversely, decision-makers who know that no one would translate the inappropriate behavior into costs would be less affected by the norm.\nFurthermore, these dynamics could also have future deterrent effects, even if they failed. In this respect, although exercising naming and shaming demonstrates deterrence failure, as neither the norm nor the possibility of naming and shaming dissuaded the unwanted activity, it may clarify the potential costs for future similar behavior. In addition, practicing naming and shaming may help mobilize opponents to this behavior, resulting in a future increase in the costs of the unwanted activity.\nAMIR LUPOVICI\n\n## Adoption of Deterrence Strategy\nIn addition, the overlap between deterrence by punishment and deterrence by denial could be used to elaborate on elements that affect the adoption of the strategy. The discussion above emphasizes not only the strategies the deterrer actor uses but also the means and timing. This provides a useful point of departure for asking questions about the reliance on deterrence strategies in general or about the exact type of deterrence, as well as about the specific means used for deterrence purposes. For example, cultural elements may explain actors’ reliance on non-offensive measures for deterrence. The case of Japan, given its culture and constitutional restrictions, is a key example of an actor that relies on deterrence by denial through defensive systems . As Katagiri (2021, 207) explains, in addition to extended deterrence it receives, Japan’s doctrine is based on “defensive defence, which bans offensive use of force even in wartime. It means that defensive force can only be used in the event of a foreign attack and is limited to the minimum necessary for self-defence. Since the 1970s it has informed Japan’s deterrence-by-denial posture and affected weapons programs and operations.”\nIn a similar way, cultural and social elements may explain a state’s reliance on strategies of deterrence by punishment or deterrence by denial that mainly use offensive measures. For Israel, for example, reliance on the actual use of force as part of practicing deterrence, and especially cumulative deterrence, is a formative idea . It is related not only to strategic elements, but also to cultural, social, and political ones . From this perspective, it matters little whether the strategy relies on deterrence by punishment or deterrence by denial. Rather, the important elements are the means used and the ability to employ them as part of a strategy of deterrence.\n## Conclusion\nIn this article, I offered a new way to distinguish among different types of deterrence strategies based on the means used for deterrent threats and the timing of when actors threaten to use them. I demonstrated each of the various types by considering examples from kinetic and cyber domains. I argue that using this categorization better captures the differences and overlapping of deterrence by punishment and deterrence by denial. In addition, viewing deterrence through these lenses also emphasizes that inflicting costs is a key aspect not only of deterrence by punishment but also of deterrence by denial.\nExploring these issues helps us to further theorize about deterrence by denial, whose study currently lags behind the research on deterrence by punishment. While this paper acknowledges this gap, it also offers and demonstrates a direction to close it by contextualizing the means deterrer actors use and recognizing that costs are an aspect common to both types of deterrence.\nI conclude by pointing to a broader research agenda derived from this research. First, this discussion helps us to reconsider how factors already acknowledged in deterrence scholarship may have different effects on the categories presented above. For example, scholars acknowledge the importance of communicating capabilities and intentions. Means used before defenders experience the challenge—either defensively or offensively—may communicate the threat more effectively than those employed only post-factum, as, for example, in the case of traditional deterrence\n\nby punishment. Furthermore, thinking through this lens may inspire research on other factors affecting deterrence success. Second, and along with the previous point, this research allows us to consider, categorize, and explain different strategies of deterrence. For example, in recent years scholars have pointed to the strategy of threatening to reveal the identity of a putative challenger through the notion of deterrence by detection or by accusation (e.g., Lindsay and Gartzke 2018, 192; Finnemore and Hollis 2020, 980–1; Wilner 2020, 271). The framework suggested here would locate this strategy as a non-offensive means operated after the execution of the undesired action: for example, technological means will help to identify post-factum who committed the attack, but communicating this capability in advance could have a deterrent effect. Considering this strategy in this category allows us to develop specific factors to account for its failure or success and help us to better contrast it with other strategies of deterrence.\nAlso important in further developing explanations of deterrence success, as discussed above, is to focus on costs or the balance of costs. Again, one set of questions concerns how costs—and not just costs of a retaliatory strike—could be communicated, including communicating both the ability to inflict costs and the intention to use these capabilities. Furthermore, distinguishing among different types of costs inflicted at different points of time is also a promising direction for theorizing deterrence success, including that of deterrence by denial.\nThis categorization inspires additional questions about the adoption of the strategy. For example, scholars could explore whether actors prioritize some means for deterrent purposes over others, such as in the Japanese and Israeli cases briefly discussed above. Scholars could also ask more specific questions about key concepts, such as the cult of reputation. For example, they could compare the effects of this cult on actors’ reliance on offensive and non-offensive means when they consider adopting or issuing a deterrent threat.\nFinally, on an empirical level, this framework offers a useful direction to explore cyber deterrence further. As noted above, while deterrence by denial seems a more effective strategy to address cyber security concerns, such research requires further theoretical development (e.g., Borghard and Lonergan 2023, 534-5). My research addresses this challenge by offering specific directions to explore cyber deterrence success (and its adoption). For example, the emphasis of this conceptual framework on “costs” is pertinent to exploring cyber security given the various costs involved for both the defender and the putative challenger. Likewise, cyber technologies could spark interesting debates on the distinction between offensive and non-offensive means both in thinking about deterrence success and in studying the adoption of the strategy. This is especially important given questions about what counts as offensive or violent means in the cyber domain, and thus what legitimizes a response and with what means.",

Despite its prominence, however, the scholarship on deterrence by denial stands to be developed further. It lags behind scholarship on deterrence by punishment on two points: in identifying the conditions under which the strategy works and in examining elements affecting its adoption. Deterrence by denial also carries some conceptual ambiguity since its employment takes many significantly different forms and also because it overlaps with deterrence by punishment. Despite the emphasis in current scholarship on \"inflicting costs\" as a defining element of deterrence by punishment, costs arguably also play a significant role in deterrence by denial. To address these challenges, I distinguish between deterrence strategies by focusing on two main elements: the means the deterrer actor threatens to use (offensive or non-offensive) and the timing of the threatened use of these means (before or after the unwanted activity). This offers a more nuanced distinction between deterrence strategies and better encompasses the role of inflicting costs in deterrence by denial. I suggest that this research offers a useful point of departure to further theorize about deterrence by denial, and it sets a promising research agenda that is pertinent given the growing interest in deterrence by denial, especially in its application to cyber deterrence.\nLa estrategia de disuasión por negación es ampliamente utilizada por diferentes agentes.

Néanmoins, malgré son importance, elle ne fait l'objet que de peu de travaux de recherche. Elle a du retard par rapport à la recherche sur la dissuasion par la punition à deux niveaux : quand il s'agit d'identifier les conditions de fonctionnement d'une stratégie et quand il s'agit d'analyser les éléments qui ont une incidence sur son adoption. La dissuasion par le déni s'accompagne également d'une certaine ambiguïté conceptuelle, car son emploi revêt des formes très différentes et elle a tendance à recouper la dissuasion par la punition. Malgré l'accent actuel des recherches sur les « coûts infligés » comme élément définitoire de la dissuasion par la punition, ceux-ci pourraient bien aussi jouer un rôle important dans la dissuasion par le déni. Pour répondre à ces défis, je distingue les stratégies de dissuasion en me concentrant sur deux éléments principaux : les moyens que l'acteur dissuasif menace d'utiliser (offensifs ou non) et la temporalité d'application de cette menace (avant ou après l'activité indésirable). Ainsi apparaît une distinction plus nuancée des stratégies de dissuasion, qui représente plus justement le rôle des coûts infligés dans la dissuasion par le déni. Selon moi, ce travail de recherche propose un point de départ utile quand il s'agit de pousser la théorisation de la dissuasion par le déni et un programme de recherche prometteur et pertinent, étant donné l'intérêt croissant pour la dissuasion par le déni, en particulier pour son application de cyberdissuasion.\nKeywords: deterrence, deterrence by denial\nPalabras clave: disuasión, disuasión por negación\nMots clés: dissuasion, dissuasion par le déni\n# Introduction\nA key classical distinction in deterrence scholarship is between deterrence by punishment and deterrence by denial. Suggested as early as the late 1950s, this distinction in its original formulation focuses on whether the deterrent threat emphasizes the cost for the putative challengers if they execute the undesired activity (deterrence by punishment) or puts into question the challenger's ability to achieve its goals (deterrence by denial) (Snyder 1959). As Wilner and Wenger (2021, 7) explain, \"[W]hereas punishment manipulates behavior by augmenting costs, denial works by stripping away benefits ... so whereas punishment deters through the fear of pain, denial deters through the fear of failure.\" This distinction has been important for the emergence of deterrence research. Given the prominence of nuclear deterrence and its impact on this research, the concept of deterrence by punishment is conspicuous in how the study emerged (Morgan 2021, 18).\nIt is only in recent years that the concept of deterrence by denial has started to attract greater attention (e.g., Smith and Talbot 2008; Gearson 2012; Brantly 2018; Adamsky 2021; Wenger and Wilner 2021; Zilincik and Swejs 2023; Borghard and Lonergan 2023). This shift is due mainly to changes in the threat environment—the advancement of new regional and global powers on the one hand, and the grow\ning role of low-level conflicts, including terrorism and cyber conflicts, on the other (Wilner and Wenger 2021, 4--5). These changes have clarified the need for alternatives to the dominant strategy of deterrence by punishment. For example, some studies have suggested cyber deterrence by denial as an alternative because of the challenges of successfully implementing cyber deterrence by punishment (Iasiello 2013; Nye 2017, 56--57; Libicki 2021), mainly the problem of attribution (Nye 2017, 56; Schneider 2019, 112; Morgan 2021, 17). In addition, organizational competencies and technological developments, such as the advancement of better defensive measures enhance the attractiveness of the strategy of deterrence by denial (e.g. Slayton 2017, 89--90; Lilli 2021, 171; Lupovici 2021, 1687).\nI argue, however, that despite the advantages of the concept of deterrence by denial, it can be further developed theoretically and clarified conceptually. Foremost, while there is a consensus among scholars regarding key factors affecting the success of deterrence by punishment, that is, capability, credibility, and communication (e.g. Morgan 2003, 15--20), much less has been theorized about the conditions under which deterrence by denial succeeds. Likewise, the research could also be developed with regard to studying the adoption of deterrence by denial. For example, while some studies have focused on the social and cultural elements affecting the adoption of deterrence by punishment (Knopf 2013; Lupovici 2016; Adamsky 2017, 166--71), we know much less in this regard about the adoption of deterrence by denial strategies (but see Målksoo2021).\nSecond, deterrence by denial refers to various distinct mechanisms—such as defense, resilience, denial, and prevention—grouped under one category. This ambiguity not only reveals the need to clarify and map the sub-categories of deterrence by denial, but it also aggravates the challenge in studying the success of deterrence by denial—that is, in determining whether each sub-category of deterrence by denial is successful under the same conditions. In addition, and even more challenging, is the overlap between deterrence by punishment and deterrence by denial. As I discuss below, contrary to common wisdom that emphasizes the clear distinction between deterrence by punishment and deterrence by denial, both strategies concern the sensitivity of the putative challenger to “costs.” In other words, while I agree that deterrence by denial focuses on the fear of failure, this strategy is also affected by the manipulation of actors' sensitivity to “costs.” Therefore, inflicting “costs,” while considered a key element of deterrence by punishment, provides a limited borderline between deterrence by punishment and deterrence by denial since it plays a significant role in both kinds of deterrence. Some scholars have put this idea forward: for example, Brantly (2018, 35) clearly argues that both “[d]eterrence by punishment and denial are intended to manipulate the cost-benefit analysis of an adversary.” Likewise, a number of scholars have acknowledged the importance of incurring costs for deterrence by denial (e.g. Gross Stein and Levi 2015, 411; Nye 2017, 56; Mazarr 2018, 6; Libicki 2021, 192; Sawyer 2021, 111; Matania and Bachrach 2023; Zilincik and Sweijs 2023, 261). However, rather than seeing this finding as an obstacle, I argue it is an opportunity not only to clarify this strategy but also to develop a more extensive concept of deterrence in general as well as of deterrence by denial specifically.\nTo achieve this goal, I offer a new conceptualization of deterrence based on two elements: the means used by the deterrer actor to threaten (offensive or non-offensive) and the timing of the threatened use of these means (before or after the unwanted activity occurs). This theoretical move provides a way to clarify the concept of deterrence by denial and a better way to distinguish among different types of deterrence strategies, including by punishment and by denial, and thus avoids the binary distinction between them. Furthermore, this move offers a useful point of departure to advance the research of deterrence by denial success, which lags behind the research of deterrence by punishment success (Gross Stein and Levi 2015, 411; Wilner and Wenger 2021, 7; Zilincik and Sweijs 2023, 249). For example, if we\nDeterrence through Inflicting Costs\nacknowledge that deterrence by punishment and deterrence by denial overlap (i.e., they both concern inflicting costs), we can better rely on the existing scholarship of deterrence by punishment and draw important insights from it concerning both the success and the adoption of deterrence by denial. As a result, while it is beyond the scope of this paper to fully explore deterrence success, I do aim to demonstrate the advantages of the suggested conceptualization toward this goal.\nThe article unfolds as follows. In the first section, I identify a few issues on which the research of deterrence by denial could be further developed. In the second, I suggest the new conceptualization of deterrence, based on the distinction among four different categories, and illustrate them through kinetic and cyber deterrence practices. In the third section, I consider the advantages of this conceptualization regarding the main challenges of the study of deterrence by denial. I conclude by discussing further implications for deterrence scholarship.\n## The Concept of Deterrence by Denial and its Limitations\nI argue that the concept of deterrence by denial could be developed further in two interrelated ways: by elaborating on the conditions under which it succeeds and is adopted and by addressing its conceptual ambiguity.\n## The Need for Further Development of Theoretical Explanations for Deterrence by Denial\n### Deterrence Success\nIn contrast to the rich scholarship of deterrence by punishment, much less is known about the conditions under which the strategy of deterrence by denial works. Scholars agree that the conditions needed for deterrence by punishment are based on defenders' capabilities, credibility, and communication (Morgan 2003, 15-20); however, no such clear articulation of the conditions for deterrence by denial exists. For example, we do not fully know whether the traditional conditions for success of deterrence by punishment are relevant to deterrence by denial or whether we need to consider other conditions, nor do we know how actors deliver their threats in deterrence by denial strategies. While researchers have recently started to engage more specifically with these types of questions (Gearson 2012, 188; Schneider 2019, 113-4; Libicki 2021, 196, 198; Wilner 2021, 54), the scholarship still requires more comprehensive theoretical discussion and empirical studies of these conditions. What we currently have are specific assertions about particular factors that might affect deterrence success, for example, from scholars who study conventional deterrence and focus on deterrence by denial based on military capabilities (e.g., Mearsheimer 1983, 24-30, 62-6). However, as I will further discuss below, deterrence by denial does not rely exclusively on offensive capabilities or on military means in general.\n### Deterrence Adoption\nTheories of deterrence by denial could also be developed through studies elaborating on how and when actors adopt this strategy (Lupovici 2021, 1687). Most deterrence scholars focus on deterrence success rather than on its adoption. As Lupovici (2021) points out, diverting the focus to the adoption of the strategy might be useful, especially when details about deterrence success are limited or difficult to attain. Scholars have already started to explore two main elements that affect the adoption of the strategy: technological changes and cultural and social elements.\n1. Scholars have noted that its implementation in specific contexts could also be further developed. For example, despite the growing interest in studying deterrence by denial in the cyber domain, Borghard and Lonergan (2023, 534-5) conclude that the scholarship's “lack of systematic assessment of how traditional denial concepts, especially those developed in the conventional deterrence literature, could be extended to cyberspace.”\n2. Mearsheimer’s book on conventional deterrence focuses on situations of “denying an aggressor his battlefield objectives with conventional forces” (1983, 15, my emphasis).\nAMIR LUPOVICI\nHowever, these studies have mainly been in the context of deterrence by punishment. For example, some scholars have pointed to how technological changes eased the development and adoption of deterrence by punishment during the Cold War (Kratochwil 1978, 155–6; Cranesale et al. 1983, 30–2; Kaplan 1991, 111; Gundersen 1994, 295). In a similar way, scholars have shown how social elements such as culture, identity, and routines shape the adoption and implementation of practices of deterrence by punishment in different contexts (Basrur 2006, 49–79; Knopf 2013; Lupovici 2016; Adamsky 2017, 166–71). However, similar questions could be asked about deterrence by denial (e.g., Målksoo 2021): for example, whether deterrence by denial allows actors to maintain their prestige and status in the same manner as deterrence through punishment and retaliation.\n## Conceptual Ambiguity\nThe challenge of conceptual ambiguity arises from the various kinds of means of employing the strategy of deterrence by denial and from the difficulty of clearly distinguishing between deterrence by denial and deterrence by punishment.\n## Multiple Strategies\nWhile scholars who explored deterrence by denial originally tended to regard it as based primarily on defensive measures (e.g., Buzan 1987, 135), recent studies agree that deterrence by denial can be achieved in various ways (Zilincik and Sweijs 2023). As Borghard and Lonergan (2023, 541) argue, “While defense can be one mechanism that contributes to deterrence by denial, it is not the only—or even primary—means of achieving denial.” More recent scholarship has also pointed to different means to practice deterrence by denial, such as de-legitimization (Gearson 2012, 183; Stein Gross and Levi 2015, 416), resilience (Nye 2017, 56; Libicki 2021, 205), and law enforcement activities (Borghard and Lonergan 2023, 553); as well as long-term effects based on repeated failures at both strategic and tactical levels (Tor 2017, 108; Wilner 2021, 50–1).\nAlthough it is important to acknowledge the different means through which actors can operate deterrence by denial, a more comprehensive framework would provide a systematic way to categorize the various types of deterrence and thus to effectively compare and contrast among strategies of deterrence by denial and deterrence by punishment. This would also be important given the need to elucidate the conditions under which this strategy works (or is adopted). In other words, it would help to show whether different conditions are necessary for success for different sub-categories of deterrence by denial.\n## Overlap of “Costs”\nAs Wilner and Wenger (2021, 7) observe, scholars suggest that the effect of deterrence by punishment is achieved by fear of retaliation, and the deterrent effect of deterrence by denial is achieved by fear of failure (see also von Hlatky 2015, 4). While they aptly summarize the scholarship, I suggest that the distinction between deterrence by punishment and deterrence by denial is not as clear as many scholars assume.\nFirst, as Buzan (1987, 135), for example, has noted, “[I]n military terms, denial and defense have virtually identical meanings. Those who treat deterrence and defence as alternatives are assuming that deterrence is likewise synonymous with retaliation.” According to Buzan (1987, 136), since the purpose of deterrence is to prevent “unwanted actions before they occur... [L]ogically, therefore the concept of deterrence encompasses both denial and retaliation” (italics in original).\n3 While Buzan (1987) is correct to suggest that defense and denial are both methods of deterrence, along with the threat of punishment (retaliation), it should also be noted that Buzan limits his discussion to military strategies. This is\nHowever, the concern runs even deeper. The question is not whether punishment, denial, and defense should or could be seen as different methods of deterrence. Rather, what is in question is the attempt to fully distinguish between deterrence by punishment and deterrence by denial through the distinction between emphasizing costs for the putative challenger (deterrence by punishment) and emphasizing the challenger's ability to attain its goal (deterrence by denial).\nWhile fear—of failure and of inability to achieve a goal—is a constitutive element of deterrence by denial, it is only part of the deterrent mechanism. It can be suggested that “costs” also play an important role in the practices of deterrence by denial. While certain scholars do acknowledge this argument (e.g. Nye 2017, 56; Brantly 2018, 35; Mazarr 2018, 6; Sawyer 2021, 111; Matania and Bachrach 2023), some see it as being of limited importance. Gross Stein and Levi (2015, 411), for example, argue that the tactics of deterrence by denial “play principally on increasing the likelihood of failure, and only indirectly on cost.”\nThe point, however, is that effective deterrence may be attained by making it clear to the putative challengers that executing the undesired activity will be costly not because of retaliation but rather because of the costs involved in executing it. These are the potential costs the putative challenger would have to invest to acquire the means and carry out the unwanted action. When the costs associated with an activity the defender tries to prevent are low, it will be difficult to convince the putative challenger to avoid using or acquiring these means. In such cases, the challenger has little to lose even if the chances of success are also low. In contrast, increasing the putative challenger's costs could result in effective deterrence by denial. The deterrer actor does not have to make the undesired activity impossible to achieve but can influence the challenger's calculations by manipulating the costs of developing the undesired activity and executing it. Libicki (2021, 192), for example, asserts that a potential challenger needs to take into account\n> the relationship between the resources that must be invested to mount an attack and the resources that are expended to carry out an attack. If the latter are low, then having already decided to make the necessary investments, the decision to use them is likely to be influenced by the prospect of and losses from retaliation—but if the expected costs from retaliation are themselves low, the prospect of failure is likely to be of but modest importance because mounting the attack costs little.\nAlthough some scholars acknowledge this aspect of cost—which in fact challenges the clear distinction between deterrence by punishment and deterrence by denial—this insight has only marginally contributed to the (re)conceptualization of deterrence by denial: for example, in systematically considering the various costs the putative challenger may face in light of different strategies of deterrence. In other words, the distinguishing criteria of whether the deterrent threat aims to influence the challengers' perception of costs or of chances of success are not the most effective. For both strategies of deterrence—by punishment and by denial—the costs inflicted or manipulated by the defender have a significant influence on deterrence success.\n## Mapping Deterrence Strategies\nTo address the challenges discussed in the previous section, I offer a new categorization of deterrence to better conceptualize its diverse types. This categorization is based on two interrelated elements: the means the deterrer uses to threaten the putative challenger and the timing of their use.\nFor the first element, I distinguish between two main types of deterrent means: means based on offensive military capability and non-offensive means. Offensive\nAMIR LUPOVICI\nmeans are all those weapons that are used or threatened to be used to cause physical harm to an opponent. Non-offensive means are all the other means. Non-offensive means could obviously be defensive measures, but they could also be various other means that limit the damage, limit the challenger's benefits from the damage, prevent the challenger from translating the successful challenge into a meaningful achievement, or (threaten) to cause non-material costs for the putative challenger, such as through de-legitimization, shaming, and stigmatization.\nThe second element is the potential timing of the employment of the deterrent measures. Obviously, any measure needs advance preparation, development, and acquirement, as well as communication of its existence to the putative challenger. Nonetheless, a key question is whether the threat is of a measure that will be employed before or after the undesired activity occurs. Some measures are employed mainly in advance, before the unwanted activity takes place, while others are employed after the unwanted activity takes place. While issuing the threatening message occurs before the unwanted activity, it could rely on means that, if needed, will be exercised only after an unwanted activity would occur, for example, retaliation. Thus, the deterrent effect—if successful—is achieved by an opponent's understanding that these means will follow the undesired activity. Conversely, for some other deterrent measures, the deterrent effect is achieved by the putative challenger's understanding that the deterrent means are already exercised, such as in the case of walls or norm building.\nBased on this, I distinguish among four types of strategies of deterrence (see table 1).\n## Deterrence through Offensive Means Used before the Execution of the Undesired Activity\nActors use offensive means in a number of ways prior to the putative unwanted activity in order to deter it.\n## Denial Capabilities\nActors may threaten to use offensive means prior to the execution of the undesired activity to establish their ability to deny the effect of the potential challenge and thus signal to the putative challenger that it is a worthless endeavor. The idea behind this strategy is not just to physically eliminate the capabilities of the opponent, as evident in defensive strategies, but also to signal to the challenger that allocating resources to this goal is too costly given that the goal may not be accomplished. As Sawyer (2021, 111) argues,\n4My categorization is inspired by Wirtz (2021, 127–8), who acknowledges the various ways to attain deterrence thorough retaliation, punishment, and denial and distinguishes among three ways of using offensive means for deterrence by denial: “(1) threats to launch preemptive attack or preventive war to deny the opponent military capability to launch an attack; (2) threats to defeat an attack where and when it occurs…or (3) threats to eliminate the ‘bone of contention’,” thus temporary success will not lead to a political gain. However, there are a number of differences between his discussion and my framework. First, I more directly offer a systematic way to distinguish between the offensive means by putting forward the timing of their use. Second, I contrast these offensive strategies with non-offensive ones as part of the systematic categorization. Lastly, Wirtz limits his discussion to attempts to deter territorial changes.\n5My categorization is also inspired by Smith and Talbot (2008, 56–9), who distinguish among different levels of deterrence by denial: tactical, operational, and strategic. These, respectively, concern means used to prevent the act of terrorism, means that aim to prevent terrorist capabilities, and means of preventing the goals the terrorists pursue. As such, their study overlaps with the categorization suggested in this article, as timing plays a significant role in both. Nonetheless, Smith and Talbot’s categorizations also differ considerably from mine. First, Smith and Talbot focus specifically on deterring terrorism, while I use the categorization to explore various unwanted activities. Second, and more importantly, I focus on the timing of the employment of the means the deterrer actor uses, while their classification concerns the timing of the effect of the deterrence strategy. As a result, the offered categorization allows us to better compare deterrence by denial and deterrence by punishment and thus to better grasp these two types of strategies. The suggested categorization also overlaps with Zilincik and Sweijs (2023), who distinguish between different timings—before, during, and after an attack. Nonetheless, not only does their research focus on denial strategies and not on strategies of deterrence, but as a result, they also rely on different timing and consider different categories. Furthermore, their main goal is to examine the emotional effects of different denial strategies.\n8\nDeterrence through Inflicting Costs\nTable 1. Categorization of deterrence strategies\n|  Timing of use of deterrent means | The means the deterrer actor uses  |   |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|   |  Offensive measures | Non-offensive measures  |\n|  Before the execution of the undesired activity | • Denial of opponent’s capabilities\n• “Defend Forward” | • Resilience\n• De-legitimization\n• Passive defensive measures (e.g., walls)\n• “Spoofing”  |\n|  After the execution of the undesired activity | • Retaliation\n• Denying military achievements | • Active defensive systems (e.g., anti-ballistic missiles)\n• Prevention of the benefit of the undesired activity  |\nCapability denial, when defined as restricting the adversary’s access to resources required for the targeted behavior, is largely indistinguishable from an offensive strategy aimed at eliminating the adversary’s capability. However, when it is defined as strategic communication intended to alter perceptions about the availability and acquisition costs for necessary resources ... it too is a case of dissuasion.\nThis strategy is evident in threats to make a preventive or preemptive strike in a way that denies the challenger’s military option (Wirtz 2021, 127). The idea is that these strikes will not just physically prevent the challenger’s ability to perform the unwanted action but will also signal that developing such an option is a useless effort.\nSome of Israel’s operations can be understood in this context. While Israel has traditionally emphasized the strategy of deterrence by punishment (Adamsky 2017), its offensive capabilities are also used for deterrence by denial (Inbar and Sandler 1993, 322). One example is the destruction in 2007 of a nuclear reactor, secretly built in the Deir ez-Zor region in eastern Syria. While the attack was carried out through a covert airstrike to reduce the chances of an escalation, its details were officially revealed a few years later (Matania and Bachrach 2023, 13–4). Although some scholars, such as Bar (2020, 332), see Israel’s preventive and preemptive strikes as part of establishing deterrence by punishment (and cumulative deterrence), another message is being implicitly delivered: that is, allocating resources to the goals of developing nuclear capabilities will be worthless given Israel’s ability and will to eliminate them in advance (Matania and Bachrach 2023, 21). As a result, they not only deny the challenger’s ability to acquire nuclear capabilities that would challenge Israel, but they also demonstrate the involved costs for the putative challenger to invest in such an allegedly pointless endeavor. In a similar way, the operation that started in late 2018 to destroy the tunnels Hizbullah mined from Southern parts of Lebanon into Israeli territory to invade Israel was not just to eliminate Hizbullah’s capabilities: It also had a deterrent message referring to the heavy costs and resources Hizbullah put into this project, especially given the difficulties of digging in the rocky ground of the Galilee (Matania and Bachrach 2023, 23). While Israel made no prior attempts to deter Hizbullah from establishing these tunnels, the destruction aimed, among other things, to send a deterrent message in order to affect Hizbullah’s future behavior. Again, it should be emphasized that in these cases, the\nAMIR LUPOVICI\ndeterrent mechanism concerns not just the inability to succeed but also the costs associated with committing to the challenge and preparing for it.\n## Defend Forward\nThe cyber domain provides some interesting examples of this strategy based on the advance use of offensive means. For example, while there is some ambiguity regarding whether \"defend forward\" is a strategy of deterrence (by punishment) or a departure from it (Fischerkeller and Harknett 2017; King and Gallagher 2020, 27–8; Whyte 2020, 210), some scholars have interpreted the US reliance on defend forward as a strategy that is based on denial through offensive means (Sweijs and Zilincik 2020, 148). As Borghard and Lonergan (2023) argue, \"Elements of the DoD's concept of defend forward resonate with a deterrence by denial strategy, specifically those aspects that are focused on counter-cyber operations to disrupt, deny, or degrade adversary offensive capabilities and infrastructure.\" The Department of Defense Cyber Strategy (DoD 2018, 1) clearly states, \"We will defend forward to disrupt or halt malicious cyber activity at its source, including activity that falls below the level of armed conflict.\" The deterrent message was described by General Paul Nakasone, Commander of US Cyber Command and Director of the National Security Agency, in the February 2019 Congressional testimony, in which he argued that these efforts could increase the costs of opponents' military actions through \"craft[ing] tools and tactics to frustrate their efforts\" (in Borghard and Lonergan 2023, 561). He echoes the idea that deterrence by denial aims to influence an opponent not just by affecting the putative challenger's estimations of success, but also by increasing the costs of conducting the undesired activity.\n## Deterrence through Threatening to Use Offensive Means after the Execution of the Undesired Activity\nDeterring threats may also refer—and often do—to threats that will be implemented if the unwanted activity were to occur. In contrast to the first category, which refers to deterrent means that are operated prior to the execution of the unwanted activity, in this category the timing of using the deterrent means is after the execution of the unwanted activity—that is if the unwanted activity has already occurred.\n## Deterrence by Retaliation\nThis strategy is evident most clearly in cases of deterrence by punishment, where the defender threatens to retaliate—that is the threat is to use offensive means after an unwanted activity occurred—in order to convince a putative challenger to avoid it. The fundamental idea of this strategy is that credibly threatening a putative challenger with a retaliation would lead the challenger to avoid the undesired behavior, at least if the cost of punishment would exceed any potential gain (e.g., George and Smoke 1974; Morgan 2003, 1–25). As noted above, this idea has been widely developed in the context of nuclear deterrence, but it has also shaped strategies based on different offensive means, including, in recent years, cyber deterrence (e.g., in Wilner 2020, 252–4). The idea is that if deterrence works, actors will avoid challenging a deterrer actor because of the costs the retaliation would pose. For this reason, and acknowledging the limited availability of cyber targets that would allow deterrers to impose high costs on putative challengers, actors are advised to retaliate against cyberattacks not only with cyber means but also with traditional military kinetic means (e.g., Kugler 2009, 328; Schneider 2019).\n## Denial of Achievements\nThreatening to use offensive means after the challenger has executed the unwanted activity could also characterize situations of deterrence by denial (Buzan 1987, 136; Vanaga 2019, 171). Most prominently, this is the idea behind conventional military\n10\nDeterrence through Inflicting Costs\ndifference. Indeed, as Luttwak (1985, 3) notes, traditionally “the continuous deterrence generated by military force was generally treated as a bonus gain,” and their main goal was winning the war. Nonetheless, acquiring military capabilities had the advantage of not only providing a remedy for cases of an attack (and thus deterrence failure), but also affecting the putative challenger’s calculations about their chances of success. For this reason, Mazarr (2018, 2) argues that a useful way to estimate the effectiveness of deterrence by denial is to examine the “immediate balance of forces in the contested territory.” This clearly emphasizes that the costs the putative challenger may need to pay concern not just situations of deterrence by punishment but also situations of deterrence by denial. Obviously, attacking an opponent capable of defending will increase the costs for a putative challenger, not just because of retaliation but also because of the costs of waging the war, even if the challenger could win it. As Mazarr (2018, 6) notes, “Even if an attacker believes it might be successful in such cases, the costs of a long and painful war are a powerful preventive deterrent.”\n## Deterrence through Non-Offensive Means Used before the Execution of the Undesired Activity\nNon-offensive means could also be used for deterrent purposes, both prior to and following the execution of the unwanted activity of a challenger. Those used prior to the unwanted activity include a variety of strategies to threaten an opponent, such as de-legitimization, establishing resilience, and passive defense means such as establishing walls. This non-offensive deterrent means by denial work through limiting the potential damage of the undesired activity either by preventing the damage or by preventing the challenger’s ability to translate the undesired activity into meaningful damage. Exercising these means becomes part of the deterrent message the defender issues to the putative challenger.\n## De-Legitimization\nA number of scholars have pointed to de-legitimization as an effective means of deterrence by denial, especially against terrorism (Gearson 2012, 183). According to Stein Gross and Levi (2015, 417), “[T]he purpose is to manipulate the social rewards of prohibited action.” In their discussion, they rely on Wilner (2011, 26), who asserts, “[T]he objective is to reduce the challenger’s probability of achieving his goals by attacking the legitimacy of the beliefs that inform his behavior.” This strategy aims to influence the putative challenger’s perception of success—their ability to translate an attack into a political victory. Nonetheless, this strategy also relates to costs the putative challenger would pay in three meaningful ways. First, this means of deterrence through de-legitimization is partly based on the political costs the challenger will pay in their domestic arena (see also Wilner 2011, 27). Second, on the top of these costs are the direct costs associated with the means required to prepare and execute the undesired activity. Third, this strategy undermines the ability of the putative challenger to mobilize support, which also affects its available resources. In this respect, this creates costs, prevents gains, and denies its (future) capabilities.⁶\nNonetheless, the connections between de-legitimization and deterrence by denial success are complicated. On the one hand, there is some evidence that successful de-legitimization does not necessarily lead to effective deterrence. For example, Turkey successfully delegitimized the PKK (Kurdistan Workers’ Party) in the early 2000s, convincing many Western countries that it is a terror organization. However, while this successful de-legitimization had some effects on the PKK’s ability to mobilize resources and support (e.g., Casier 2010), it also “resulted in recurrence of\n⁶According to Stein Gross and Levi (2015, 416–7) and based on criminological research, deterrence by denial through de-legitimization can be based on three different audiences that affect the potential risks and rewards of the terrorists: formal authorities (law enforcement), social bonds, and informal control.\nold practices, including its default to violence” (Gürcan and Coşar Ünal 2018, 194). Conversely, some scholars have provided evidence to demonstrate terror organization leaders' sensitivity to legitimacy. For example, Knopf considers a message sent by the number two leader of al Qaeda, at the time, Ayman al-Zawahari, to the leader of this organization in Iraq, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, in which Zawahari “instructed Zarqawi that his methods, including indiscriminate attacks on Muslim civilians and the release of videos showing hostage beheadings, were so excessive they had become counterproductive.” According to Zawahiri, ‘the strongest weapon which the mujahadeen enjoys .... is popular support from the Muslim masses ... [meaning] the mujahed movement must avoid any action that the masses do not understand or approve'” (Knopf 2010, 18, ftn, 92).\nDe-legitimization is also used to deter threats other than terrorism, such as deterring cyberattacks through the development of norms (Stevens 2012, 159; Nye 2017, 60--2), in this way increasing the costs the challenger would pay with regard to different audiences (Wilner 2020, 255). As Soesanto and Smeets argue, “the creation of norms and rules for state behaviour in cyberspace, will over time translate into a general principle of restraint, raise the reputational costs of bad behaviour” (Soesanto and Smeets 2020, 393).\nThis strategy is similarly used to deter attacks in outer space. According to Mckeown and Wilner (2020), one of the means to deter an attack on US satellites is through de-legitimization, which is based on “developing ‘norms of responsible behaviour' in outer space (so as to diplomatically isolate those who would break them)” (Mckeown and Wilner 2020, 401). In fact, some official reports, such as from the US Department of Defense (2014), have pointed to the need to rely on this strategy, recommending the “development of international norms of responsible behavior that enhance safety, security, and stability in space.” According to the report, advancing these norms can have “a positive effect on deterrence; even if potential adversaries are not deterred from conducting hostile or malicious acts in space, norms can help the international community identify and isolate aggressors” (DoD 2014).\nThis example thus captures both elements of deterrence by denial and of deterrence by punishment. On the one hand, it concerns the prevention of challengers' ability to translate a successful challenge into a meaningful political achievement. In situations where such norms are strong, domestic and international audiences will prevent the putative challenger from making it a political victory. On the other hand, it also concerns deterrence by punishment, especially since the putative challenger's fear is not just of material costs associated with the punishment, but also of psychological and social costs (Sweijs and Zilincik 2020, 149--50).\nThe logic of the nuclear taboo and the emergence of normative limits to the use of nuclear weapons increase the costs of using them and thus create self-deterrence mechanisms that also overlap with both deterrence by denial and deterrence by punishment. As Tannenwald argues, while taboos affect behavior in a number of ways, some of them rely on a deterrent effect achieved by increasing domestic and international public opinion costs (Tannenwald 2007, 48--9; see also Nye 2017, 60). According to her, the norm of the taboo has not only had a significant and direct impact on the avoidance of using nuclear weapons over the years, but it has also enhanced nuclear deterrence, and thus increased the costs decision-makers would pay if they used nuclear weapons in a first strike (Tannenwald 2007, 45). In this respect, policymakers' awareness of the norm, according to Tannenwald (2007), has dissuaded them from using these weapons.\n### Establishing Resilience\nThe demonstration of resilience is another way actors can exercise deterrence by denial with non-offensive measures prior to the execution of the undesired activity.\nDefenders demonstrate and communicate to a potential challenger that they will not be able to translate the execution of the undesired activity, even if successful, into a meaningful political benefit (Gearson 2012; Libicki 2021, 205). Resilience can be used in various contexts in multiple domains of competition and vis-à-vis different kinds of challenging actors: state and non-state (Sweijs and Zilincik 2020, 148). In addition, it can be employed with different means. For example, resilience can be achieved through technological solutions, such as backup and recovery systems in case of cyberattacks (Nye 2017, 56). Actors can also rely on developing procedures and routines to better prepare for absorbing undesired activities such as terror attacks, for example, by educating the public about such situations. Gearson (2012, 191) suggests that “[b]y demonstrating that a society is resilient and well prepared for dislocations and shock, with intelligent design and disaster recovery procedures embedded into government and private sector behaviour, the target communities will also be reassured and confident of recovery.” Furthermore, effective use of resilience mechanisms may create substantial costs for the putative challenger, implying that investing efforts in targeting the defender is not a wise decision for allocating resources. As Nye (2017, 56) suggests regarding these means, “Attackers have limited resources and time; therefore, driving up the costs can deter attacks.”\n### Defensive Means\nStrategies of deterrence by denial also rely on defensive means that could be used or employed before the execution of the undesired activity (e.g. Goldgeier and Wojtowicz. 2022, 5), including walls and fortifications. Cioffi-Revilla (1999), for example, uses archeological evidence from different regions to demonstrate that deterrence by denial was used thousands of years ago. According to him, massive walls “signal significant material capacity and likely organizational know-how to implement deterrence by denial” (Cioffi-Revilla 1999, 247). These walls are also used in modern times with varying degrees of success, including against armies and terror attacks (Naroll et al. 1974, Brantly 2018, 35) and even against migrants (Kent et al. 2020, 856, 864). The intention in these cases is to deter by signaling to individuals and armies that they will not be able to achieve their desired goals or that they will need to invest substantial resources toward it. Findings from migration scholarship show that while walls decrease the number of people who cross these specific areas, the numbers often increase in other areas (Kent et al. 2020, 871). This echoes the point about the interrelated effects of the costs and chances of success in executing an action a deterrer actor attempts to prevent. Lastly, passive defense measures like “civil defense” are also based on non-military means that serve deterrence by denial, such as using shelters or evacuating populations in certain scenarios. These measures are used prior to the occurrence of the unwanted activity (Freedman 2004, 37). While such measures can also be costly for the defender, they significantly limit the potential gain a putative challenger can make from executing the unwanted activity, and thus may decrease its attractiveness.\nSome cyber defensive measures may seem similar to traditional security means: for example, (fire-)walls, which are used to harden cyber targets and defend against cyberattacks and thus could have deterrent effect (Nye 2017, 56). Cyber technologies provide some other unique ways to use this type of strategy, for example, by remodeling the cyber terrain. This may enhance cyber defense and thus has deterrence by denial effects (Matania and Tal-Shir 2020, 292).\n### Spoofing\nPlanting dummy targets makes the execution of the unwanted activity more costly and thus can be used as a strategy of deterrence by denial. The rationale is that planting dummy targets increases the potential future efforts and costs the putative challengers need to invest since resources have to be allocated to identify the real\nAMIR LUPOVICI\n13\ntargets. An example of this kind of deterrence is evident in protecting maritime vessels. According to Gutman and Rojkes Dombe (2017), defenders may exercise this strategy through electronic means that signal locations of alleged vessels that do not really exist. As they note, “planting hundreds of military dummy targets, through the AIS [Automatic Identification System] protocol, into the status picture of defending side’s coastal layout” creates a deterrence by denial effect, dissuading an opponent from going out to sea to begin with (Gutman and Rojkes Dombe 2017). While powerful actors, such as the United States, may have resources and various capabilities that allow them to exactly trace the location of vessels—such as through intelligence, reconnaissance, and surveillance assets (e.g., Mirski 2013, 406)—not all putative challengers have access to these capabilities.\nAnother example is the music industry’s attempt in the early 2000s to deter the sharing of media files through streaming services such as Napster. Various measures were used to complicate access to these files and thus to deter potential users (Pesta 2004, 406–10; Jennings and Bossler 2020). Spoofing was one of these methods, where copyright holders uploaded corrupted files, including fake music files, that provided computer users with “static, popping, cracking noises, or silence instead of the unauthorized music file they were attempting to download” (Pesta 2004, 408–9). The industry even hired some companies to distribute these fake files (Segal 2002). The explicit aim of these attempts was to create a deterrent effect: Given the time and costs of downloading files in the early 2000s, the attractiveness of this activity was lessened by actors’ knowledge that there was a good chance the file would be corrupted. In the end, the deterrent effect was aimed to be achieved by reducing the likelihood of success of downloading the media files. Nonetheless, the strategy also emphasizes the importance of “costs” for deterrence by denial. If there were no costs to downloading the music—internet costs, time invested in searching for the files, the annoyance of downloading a corrupted file—then there would be no deterrent effect. Interestingly, as Jennings and Bossler (2020, 1038–9) note, this strategy had little deterrent effect because the corrupted files were identified and so users could avoid them.\n## Deterrence through Threatening to Use Non-Offensive Means after the Execution of the Undesired Activity\nLastly, actors could threaten to use non-offensive measures after absorbing the undesired activity. Most commonly, this could be done through threatening to use defensive measures to deny the effectiveness of the challenge, for example, thorough “anti-aircraft or anti-ballistic missile systems designed to bring down the enemy offensive before any targets were reached” (Freedman 2004, 37). Clearly, the defender needs to have these capabilities as well as to communicate them to the putative challenger to dissuade the unwanted action (see also Golov 2016, 89).\nAn effective deterrence by denial carries the message that preparing and executing the challenge would be costly because the resources allocated would not be worth it. As Sawyer (2021, 111) notes, “Tactical denial—communication about target-hardening efforts—conveys the adversary that it must adopt new tactics, which are likely to increase the cost or uncertainty of action in the short term.” Denial could be established on defensive components in such a way that “an adver\n7Scholars have pointed to a number of challenges concerning this strategy: for example, the limited credibility of reliance on defensive systems for deterrence, especially given the limited “margin of error” (Freedman 2004, 37), their costs (Adamsky 2021, 184), the challenges they create for deterrence by punishment (Adamsky 2021, 185), and the incentives they may give to a putative challenger in order to exhaust the defensive systems budget (Brantly 2018, 36). For a review of strategic negative implications of defensive systems on deterrence, see Quackenbush (2006, 533), who nonetheless contends that these systems eventually enhance deterrence success (Quackenbush 2006, but see Golov 2016).\nsary cannot go on the offense without incurring significant costs” (Borghard and Lonergan 2017, 474). This view is part of how Katagiri (2021), who focuses on deterrence through defensive means, defines deterrence by denial. According to him, it is the “ability to deny actions and persuade the opponent that it is unlikely to attain its immediate objectives at a reasonable cost” (Katagiri 2021, 203, my emphasis). This means that defensive measures may increase the costs for a putative challenger to execute the attack and thus, as in deterrence by punishment, may affect not only their chance of success but also their costs of planning, developing, and executing the challenge.\nTo take a more concrete example, Israel in recent years has shifted its strategy, relying increasingly on active defense systems to cover various types of threats, including the Iron Dome missile defense batteries that aim to intercept short-range rockets and the Arrow system that aims to intercept long-range missiles. Although skeptical about how effective these defensive measures are in creating successful deterrence, Adamsky (2021, 178--81) acknowledges that the changes in the strategic environment “produced a much stronger emphasis on defense in Israeli national security, and thus somewhat expanded the role of deterrence by denial in Israel strategic thought.”\nActive defense systems are also used for deterrence by denial strategies to dissuade cyberattacks. While the question remains as to whether these defensive systems could effectively provide defense or deterrence by denial, a number of scholars suggest this at least as a theoretical option (Borghard and Lonergan 2023, 534-5). Schneider (2019, 113), for example, argues that “cyber defense” could be achieved through “securing nodes of civilian and military networks” such as space-based satellites and optic cables. The point, however, is that while cyber infrastructures could be defended with passive means, they could also be defended by active defense measures, including kinetic means such as ballistic missiles, as part of a cross-domain deterrence.\nHowever, non-offensive means do not necessarily need to be military ones. For example, policies of deterrence to prevent immigration rely on means used after the perceived unwanted activity occurs such as detaining immigrants, preventing social benefits and work rights, and reducing access to legal due process (Kent et al. 2020, 856). All these means are characterized by being employed after the unwanted action has taken place—the immigrants have already entered a country whose government aims to deter immigration. The idea behind these deterrent policies is to demonstrate to potential immigrants that they will not be able to succeed: for example, they will be unable to work in the target country. This negates the value of the costs invested in the immigration process and in the efforts to immigrate into their territories.\n## Toward a Revised Theory of Deterrence by Denial\nThe discussion so far demonstrates that while deterrence by punishment and deterrence by denial can be contrasted if we consider them through their strategic goals, overlaps can be seen by looking at the strategies' means as well as their timing. For example, both deterrence by denial and deterrence by punishment could be established by using offensive means, even those used after the execution of the challenge. The discussion also shows that inflicting costs is a significant element not only of deterrence by punishment but also of deterrence by denial. The strategy of deterrence by denial involves mechanisms that can increase the costs for the putative challenger, including costs associated with resources to prepare for and conduct the undesired activity. Some strategies of deterrence by denial concern other\nkinds of costs, such as costs the actor may pay in domestic and international arenas about its legitimization, which can affect its ability (and motivation) to execute the undesired activity. Taking these elements together, and acknowledging the overlap between deterrence by punishment and deterrence by denial, opens a path to further theorize deterrence by denial. Furthermore, acknowledging the overlap may lead a more general theory of deterrence to account for both types of deterrence.\nWhile it is beyond the scope of this article to cover all the factors accounting for the success of deterrence by denial, taking steps toward this goal could prove useful to demonstrate the advantages of the suggested conceptualization when it comes to explaining deterrence success and considering the adoption of the strategy.\n### Deterrence Success—The Balance of Costs\nAs demonstrated above, different means of both deterrence by punishment and deterrence by denial may incur costs in various ways for putative challengers. It follows then that a key concept in accounting for deterrence success (of deterrence by either punishment or denial) is the balance of costs. When the costs to the putative challenger of executing the challenge are low—because the cost of expected retaliation is low, because the costs of the means for the attack are low, because the costs of executing the attack are low, and/or because the domestic audience supports paying these costs—the challenge will be much more difficult to successfully deter. Similarly, when acquiring or using the means of deterrence is costly for the defender, it is difficult to threaten using them as deterrents (see also Matania and Bachrach 2023).\nThis was exactly the situation with Israel's reliance on defensive measures to deter Hamas rockets launched from Gaza using the Iron Dome system. The costs for Hamas were between 500 and 1,000 US dollars per Katyusha rocket, while each intercepting missile costs 50,000 and a battery of Iron Dome costs around 100 million US dollars (Brantly 2018, 36). Although the costs for Israel in a situation without any defensive measures might be much higher given the potential damage these rockets can do, this system's deterrent effect in preventing these attacks is very limited. In fact, some have pointed out that these unbalanced costs may incentivize Hamas to challenge Israel to erode its security budget. This is why former Israeli Prime Minister, Naftali Bennet (2022), declared that Israel is developing a defense system based on laser technology: To change “[t]he economic equation ... If it is possible to intercept a missile or rocket with just an electric pulse that costs a few dollars, we will have nullified the ring of fire that Iran has set up on our borders. The whole thing no longer pays off.”\nIn contrast, in other cases, the deterrer actors may be the ones who enjoy the “balance of costs.” An interesting example is provided by Lior Div, the CEO of Cybereason, a cyber security company. Although he does not refer to the concept of deterrence by denial, he clearly demonstrates this logic when discussing the SolarWinds attack. This was a serious cyberattack, likely sponsored by a foreign government, that infected numerous computers in the United States in late 2020, including nine government agencies and a hundred private companies. In an interview, Div noted that “SolarWinds attackers scanned networks to determine if Cybereason's software was installed. If they saw that it was present, they bypassed it and moved along to another network” (Levy 2021). Given the system's past successes, the hackers did not want it to gather information on their malicious code. This is an example of deterrence by denial based on the challenger's fear that the system could effectively detect and neutralize the attack and thus render the efforts invested in the malicious code useless. More generally, while not entirely deterring the use of this attack and not using fear of retaliation, the Cybereason system effectively deterred by denial the attack on the computers on which it operated.\nAnother important factor affecting the balance of costs, and thus deterrence success, is the cost for the putative challenger of identifying relevant targets and knowing how costly it would be to execute the challenge: for example, in case of defensive missiles, how costly it would be for a putative challenger to identify areas the system cannot fully cover, or, similarly, in the case of building walls, how costly (how many resources it would take) it would be for immigrants to identify alternative routes to those blocked by walls. It could be that these latter costs are not high, as evidence shows that while walls have a deterrent effect, the number of those crossing in areas without walls increases (Kent et al. 2020, 871). Another example is in the case of spoofing. As noted above, the costs of identifying the fake media files were very low (Jennings and Bossler 2020, 1038--9), which led to deterrence failure. Nonetheless, planting dummy targets at sea seems a much more effective strategy given that many actors do not have access to measures that allow them to identify the real targets, thus significantly increasing their costs to distinguish between real and faked ones (Gutman and Rojkes Dombe 2017).\nThe cost of knowing is also affected by another factor; that is, the costs to execute the activity the defender aims to prevent. When the costs to execute the unwanted activity are very low, the costs of knowing become less important, since a putative challenger may easily challenge many possible targets. For example, as noted above, when the cost for launching rockets is low, as in the case of the rockets Hamas launches against Israel (Brantly 2018, 36), putative challengers do not need to invest many resources into identifying alternative targets, thus indicating the limited effectiveness of deterrence by denial.\nThe costs of knowing are also relevant for deterrence by punishment. In some cases, deterrer actors, indeed, clearly state what the costs would be for executing the unwanted behavior and what would be considered as such a behavior. Nonetheless, in many other cases, the deterrent threat includes ambiguities (see Crawford 2003, 11--2) that force the putative challenger to invest resources in identifying the structure of costs. In terms of the balance of costs, this adds another layer and trade-off of costs affecting deterrence success.\nLastly, the balance of costs may also be affected by different mechanisms and means operated at different times. This is because a deterrent means may incur additional costs at times other than when they are exercised. Acknowledging the different categories presented above, which refer to different timings at which the deterrent means are exercised, may thus point to other ways to enhance the deterrent threat. For example, as discussed above, building norms is a non-offensive deterrent means used prior to the execution of the unwanted activity. Its effectiveness stems from policymakers' sensitivity to the domestic and international public opinion costs, and thus on their ability to translate the unwanted activity into a meaningful political achievement. However, while normative structures create a pre-condition for deterrence success, the deterrent effect may be enhanced by other mechanisms that could be exercised if an unwanted activity takes place, such as naming and shaming. Breaking norms inflict “a kind of social punishment on the normative transgressor. A loss of face amongst the international community is the likely outcome of such a naming and shaming exercise” (Ryan 2018, 337). In other words, naming and shaming practices allow an actor to translate the norm into a specific deterrent threat, and thus to incur more concrete costs (Schulz 2015, 41). Conversely, decision-makers who know that no one would translate the inappropriate behavior into costs would be less affected by the norm.\nFurthermore, these dynamics could also have future deterrent effects, even if they failed. In this respect, although exercising naming and shaming demonstrates deterrence failure, as neither the norm nor the possibility of naming and shaming dissuaded the unwanted activity, it may clarify the potential costs for future similar behavior. In addition, practicing naming and shaming may help mobilize opponents to this behavior, resulting in a future increase in the costs of the unwanted activity.\nAMIR LUPOVICI\n17\nIn this respect, these dynamics are similar to what is considered in the scholarship as cumulative deterrence, where the actual retaliation is used to clarify for putative challengers the capabilities and resolve of the defender (e.g., Stein 1996; Kello 2017, 209–11; Kirchofer 2017; Tor 2017).\n## Adoption of Deterrence Strategy\nIn addition, the overlap between deterrence by punishment and deterrence by denial could be used to elaborate on elements that affect the adoption of the strategy. The discussion above emphasizes not only the strategies the deterrer actor uses but also the means and timing. This provides a useful point of departure for asking questions about the reliance on deterrence strategies in general or about the exact type of deterrence, as well as about the specific means used for deterrence purposes. For example, cultural elements may explain actors’ reliance on non-offensive measures for deterrence. The case of Japan, given its culture and constitutional restrictions, is a key example of an actor that relies on deterrence by denial through defensive systems (Katagiri 2021). As Katagiri (2021, 207) explains, in addition to extended deterrence it receives, Japan’s doctrine is based on “defensive defence, which bans offensive use of force even in wartime. It means that defensive force can only be used in the event of a foreign attack and is limited to the minimum necessary for self-defence. Since the 1970s it has informed Japan’s deterrence-by-denial posture and affected weapons programs and operations.”\nIn a similar way, cultural and social elements may explain a state’s reliance on strategies of deterrence by punishment or deterrence by denial that mainly use offensive measures. For Israel, for example, reliance on the actual use of force as part of practicing deterrence, and especially cumulative deterrence, is a formative idea (Bar-Joseph 1998, 156–7; Almog 2004–5; Bar 2020, 324–5, 330–1). It is related not only to strategic elements, but also to cultural, social, and political ones (Sucharov 2005, 31, 68; Barnett 2013, 37–47; Lupovici 2016, 54). From this perspective, it matters little whether the strategy relies on deterrence by punishment or deterrence by denial. Rather, the important elements are the means used and the ability to employ them as part of a strategy of deterrence.\n## Conclusion\nIn this article, I offered a new way to distinguish among different types of deterrence strategies based on the means used for deterrent threats and the timing of when actors threaten to use them. I demonstrated each of the various types by considering examples from kinetic and cyber domains. I argue that using this categorization better captures the differences and overlapping of deterrence by punishment and deterrence by denial. In addition, viewing deterrence through these lenses also emphasizes that inflicting costs is a key aspect not only of deterrence by punishment but also of deterrence by denial.\nExploring these issues helps us to further theorize about deterrence by denial, whose study currently lags behind the research on deterrence by punishment. While this paper acknowledges this gap, it also offers and demonstrates a direction to close it by contextualizing the means deterrer actors use and recognizing that costs are an aspect common to both types of deterrence.\nI conclude by pointing to a broader research agenda derived from this research. First, this discussion helps us to reconsider how factors already acknowledged in deterrence scholarship may have different effects on the categories presented above. For example, scholars acknowledge the importance of communicating capabilities and intentions. Means used before defenders experience the challenge—either defensively or offensively—may communicate the threat more effectively than those employed only post-factum, as, for example, in the case of traditional deterrence\n18\nDeterrence through Inflicting Costs\nby punishment. Furthermore, thinking through this lens may inspire research on other factors affecting deterrence success. Second, and along with the previous point, this research allows us to consider, categorize, and explain different strategies of deterrence. For example, in recent years scholars have pointed to the strategy of threatening to reveal the identity of a putative challenger through the notion of deterrence by detection or by accusation (e.g., Lindsay and Gartzke 2018, 192; Finnemore and Hollis 2020, 980–1; Wilner 2020, 271). The framework suggested here would locate this strategy as a non-offensive means operated after the execution of the undesired action: for example, technological means will help to identify post-factum who committed the attack, but communicating this capability in advance could have a deterrent effect. Considering this strategy in this category allows us to develop specific factors to account for its failure or success and help us to better contrast it with other strategies of deterrence.\nAlso important in further developing explanations of deterrence success, as discussed above, is to focus on costs or the balance of costs. Again, one set of questions concerns how costs—and not just costs of a retaliatory strike—could be communicated, including communicating both the ability to inflict costs and the intention to use these capabilities. Furthermore, distinguishing among different types of costs inflicted at different points of time is also a promising direction for theorizing deterrence success, including that of deterrence by denial.\nThis categorization inspires additional questions about the adoption of the strategy. For example, scholars could explore whether actors prioritize some means for deterrent purposes over others, such as in the Japanese and Israeli cases briefly discussed above. Scholars could also ask more specific questions about key concepts, such as the cult of reputation (Tang 2005). For example, they could compare the effects of this cult on actors’ reliance on offensive and non-offensive means when they consider adopting or issuing a deterrent threat.\nFinally, on an empirical level, this framework offers a useful direction to explore cyber deterrence further. As noted above, while deterrence by denial seems a more effective strategy to address cyber security concerns, such research requires further theoretical development (e.g., Borghard and Lonergan 2023, 534-5). My research addresses this challenge by offering specific directions to explore cyber deterrence success (and its adoption). For example, the emphasis of this conceptual framework on “costs” is pertinent to exploring cyber security given the various costs involved for both the defender and the putative challenger. Likewise, cyber technologies could spark interesting debates on the distinction between offensive and non-offensive means both in thinking about deterrence success and in studying the adoption of the strategy. This is especially important given questions about what counts as offensive or violent means in the cyber domain, and thus what legitimizes a response and with what means (Lupovici 2019, 181)."

Despite its prominence, however, the scholarship on deterrence by denial stands to be developed further. It lags behind scholarship on deterrence by punishment on two points: in identifying the conditions under which the strategy works and in examining elements affecting its adoption. Deterrence by denial also carries some conceptual ambiguity since its employment takes many significantly different forms and also because it overlaps with deterrence by punishment. Despite the emphasis in current scholarship on \"inflicting costs\" as a defining element of deterrence by punishment, costs arguably also play a significant role in deterrence by denial. To address these challenges, I distinguish between deterrence strategies by focusing on two main elements: the means the deterrer actor threatens to use (offensive or non-offensive) and the timing of the threatened use of these means (before or after the unwanted activity). This offers a more nuanced distinction between deterrence strategies and better encompasses the role of inflicting costs in deterrence by denial. I suggest that this research offers a useful point of departure to further theorize about deterrence by denial, and it sets a promising research agenda that is pertinent given the growing interest in deterrence by denial, especially in its application to cyber deterrence.\nLa estrategia de disuasión por negación es ampliamente utilizada por diferentes agentes.

A pesar del énfasis existente en el mundo académico actual en usar el hecho de «imponer costes» como un elemento definitorio de la disuasión por castigo, estos costes también juegan un papel importante en la disuasión por negación.

Néanmoins, malgré son importance, elle ne fait l'objet que de peu de travaux de recherche. Elle a du retard par rapport à la recherche sur la dissuasion par la punition à deux niveaux : quand il s'agit d'identifier les conditions de fonctionnement d'une stratégie et quand il s'agit d'analyser les éléments qui ont une incidence sur son adoption. La dissuasion par le déni s'accompagne également d'une certaine ambiguïté conceptuelle, car son emploi revêt des formes très différentes et elle a tendance à recouper la dissuasion par la punition. Malgré l'accent actuel des recherches sur les « coûts infligés » comme élément définitoire de la dissuasion par la punition, ceux-ci pourraient bien aussi jouer un rôle important dans la dissuasion par le déni. Pour répondre à ces défis, je distingue les stratégies de dissuasion en me concentrant sur deux éléments principaux : les moyens que l'acteur dissuasif menace d'utiliser (offensifs ou non) et la temporalité d'application de cette menace (avant ou après l'activité indésirable). Ainsi apparaît une distinction plus nuancée des stratégies de dissuasion, qui représente plus justement le rôle des coûts infligés dans la dissuasion par le déni. Selon moi, ce travail de recherche propose un point de départ utile quand il s'agit de pousser la théorisation de la dissuasion par le déni et un programme de recherche prometteur et pertinent, étant donné l'intérêt croissant pour la dissuasion par le déni, en particulier pour son application de cyberdissuasion.\nKeywords: deterrence, deterrence by denial\nPalabras clave: disuasión, disuasión por negación\nMots clés: dissuasion, dissuasion par le déni\n# Introduction\nA key classical distinction in deterrence scholarship is between deterrence by punishment and deterrence by denial. Suggested as early as the late 1950s, this distinction in its original formulation focuses on whether the deterrent threat emphasizes the cost for the putative challengers if they execute the undesired activity (deterrence by punishment) or puts into question the challenger's ability to achieve its goals (deterrence by denial) (Snyder 1959). As Wilner and Wenger (2021, 7) explain, \"[W]hereas punishment manipulates behavior by augmenting costs, denial works by stripping away benefits ... so whereas punishment deters through the fear of pain, denial deters through the fear of failure.\" This distinction has been important for the emergence of deterrence research. Given the prominence of nuclear deterrence and its impact on this research, the concept of deterrence by punishment is conspicuous in how the study emerged (Morgan 2021, 18).\nIt is only in recent years that the concept of deterrence by denial has started to attract greater attention (e.g., Smith and Talbot 2008; Gearson 2012; Brantly 2018; Adamsky 2021; Wenger and Wilner 2021; Zilincik and Swejs 2023; Borghard and Lonergan 2023). This shift is due mainly to changes in the threat environment—the advancement of new regional and global powers on the one hand, and the grow\ning role of low-level conflicts, including terrorism and cyber conflicts, on the other (Wilner and Wenger 2021, 4--5). These changes have clarified the need for alternatives to the dominant strategy of deterrence by punishment. For example, some studies have suggested cyber deterrence by denial as an alternative because of the challenges of successfully implementing cyber deterrence by punishment (Iasiello 2013; Nye 2017, 56--57; Libicki 2021), mainly the problem of attribution (Nye 2017, 56; Schneider 2019, 112; Morgan 2021, 17). In addition, organizational competencies and technological developments, such as the advancement of better defensive measures enhance the attractiveness of the strategy of deterrence by denial (e.g. Slayton 2017, 89--90; Lilli 2021, 171; Lupovici 2021, 1687).\nI argue, however, that despite the advantages of the concept of deterrence by denial, it can be further developed theoretically and clarified conceptually. Foremost, while there is a consensus among scholars regarding key factors affecting the success of deterrence by punishment, that is, capability, credibility, and communication (e.g. Morgan 2003, 15--20), much less has been theorized about the conditions under which deterrence by denial succeeds. Likewise, the research could also be developed with regard to studying the adoption of deterrence by denial. For example, while some studies have focused on the social and cultural elements affecting the adoption of deterrence by punishment (Knopf 2013; Lupovici 2016; Adamsky 2017, 166--71), we know much less in this regard about the adoption of deterrence by denial strategies (but see Målksoo2021).\nSecond, deterrence by denial refers to various distinct mechanisms—such as defense, resilience, denial, and prevention—grouped under one category. This ambiguity not only reveals the need to clarify and map the sub-categories of deterrence by denial, but it also aggravates the challenge in studying the success of deterrence by denial—that is, in determining whether each sub-category of deterrence by denial is successful under the same conditions. In addition, and even more challenging, is the overlap between deterrence by punishment and deterrence by denial. As I discuss below, contrary to common wisdom that emphasizes the clear distinction between deterrence by punishment and deterrence by denial, both strategies concern the sensitivity of the putative challenger to “costs.” In other words, while I agree that deterrence by denial focuses on the fear of failure, this strategy is also affected by the manipulation of actors' sensitivity to “costs.” Therefore, inflicting “costs,” while considered a key element of deterrence by punishment, provides a limited borderline between deterrence by punishment and deterrence by denial since it plays a significant role in both kinds of deterrence. Some scholars have put this idea forward: for example, Brantly (2018, 35) clearly argues that both “[d]eterrence by punishment and denial are intended to manipulate the cost-benefit analysis of an adversary.” Likewise, a number of scholars have acknowledged the importance of incurring costs for deterrence by denial (e.g. Gross Stein and Levi 2015, 411; Nye 2017, 56; Mazarr 2018, 6; Libicki 2021, 192; Sawyer 2021, 111; Matania and Bachrach 2023; Zilincik and Sweijs 2023, 261). However, rather than seeing this finding as an obstacle, I argue it is an opportunity not only to clarify this strategy but also to develop a more extensive concept of deterrence in general as well as of deterrence by denial specifically.\nTo achieve this goal, I offer a new conceptualization of deterrence based on two elements: the means used by the deterrer actor to threaten (offensive or non-offensive) and the timing of the threatened use of these means (before or after the unwanted activity occurs). This theoretical move provides a way to clarify the concept of deterrence by denial and a better way to distinguish among different types of deterrence strategies, including by punishment and by denial, and thus avoids the binary distinction between them. Furthermore, this move offers a useful point of departure to advance the research of deterrence by denial success, which lags behind the research of deterrence by punishment success (Gross Stein and Levi 2015, 411; Wilner and Wenger 2021, 7; Zilincik and Sweijs 2023, 249). For example, if we\nDeterrence through Inflicting Costs\nacknowledge that deterrence by punishment and deterrence by denial overlap (i.e., they both concern inflicting costs), we can better rely on the existing scholarship of deterrence by punishment and draw important insights from it concerning both the success and the adoption of deterrence by denial. As a result, while it is beyond the scope of this paper to fully explore deterrence success, I do aim to demonstrate the advantages of the suggested conceptualization toward this goal.\nThe article unfolds as follows. In the first section, I identify a few issues on which the research of deterrence by denial could be further developed. In the second, I suggest the new conceptualization of deterrence, based on the distinction among four different categories, and illustrate them through kinetic and cyber deterrence practices. In the third section, I consider the advantages of this conceptualization regarding the main challenges of the study of deterrence by denial. I conclude by discussing further implications for deterrence scholarship.\n## The Concept of Deterrence by Denial and its Limitations\nI argue that the concept of deterrence by denial could be developed further in two interrelated ways: by elaborating on the conditions under which it succeeds and is adopted and by addressing its conceptual ambiguity.\n## The Need for Further Development of Theoretical Explanations for Deterrence by Denial\n### Deterrence Success\nIn contrast to the rich scholarship of deterrence by punishment, much less is known about the conditions under which the strategy of deterrence by denial works. Scholars agree that the conditions needed for deterrence by punishment are based on defenders' capabilities, credibility, and communication (Morgan 2003, 15-20); however, no such clear articulation of the conditions for deterrence by denial exists. For example, we do not fully know whether the traditional conditions for success of deterrence by punishment are relevant to deterrence by denial or whether we need to consider other conditions, nor do we know how actors deliver their threats in deterrence by denial strategies. While researchers have recently started to engage more specifically with these types of questions (Gearson 2012, 188; Schneider 2019, 113-4; Libicki 2021, 196, 198; Wilner 2021, 54), the scholarship still requires more comprehensive theoretical discussion and empirical studies of these conditions. What we currently have are specific assertions about particular factors that might affect deterrence success, for example, from scholars who study conventional deterrence and focus on deterrence by denial based on military capabilities (e.g., Mearsheimer 1983, 24-30, 62-6). However, as I will further discuss below, deterrence by denial does not rely exclusively on offensive capabilities or on military means in general.\n### Deterrence Adoption\nTheories of deterrence by denial could also be developed through studies elaborating on how and when actors adopt this strategy (Lupovici 2021, 1687). Most deterrence scholars focus on deterrence success rather than on its adoption. As Lupovici (2021) points out, diverting the focus to the adoption of the strategy might be useful, especially when details about deterrence success are limited or difficult to attain. Scholars have already started to explore two main elements that affect the adoption of the strategy: technological changes and cultural and social elements.\n1. Scholars have noted that its implementation in specific contexts could also be further developed. For example, despite the growing interest in studying deterrence by denial in the cyber domain, Borghard and Lonergan (2023, 534-5) conclude that the scholarship's “lack of systematic assessment of how traditional denial concepts, especially those developed in the conventional deterrence literature, could be extended to cyberspace.”\n2. Mearsheimer’s book on conventional deterrence focuses on situations of “denying an aggressor his battlefield objectives with conventional forces” (1983, 15, my emphasis).\nAMIR LUPOVICI\nHowever, these studies have mainly been in the context of deterrence by punishment. For example, some scholars have pointed to how technological changes eased the development and adoption of deterrence by punishment during the Cold War (Kratochwil 1978, 155–6; Cranesale et al. 1983, 30–2; Kaplan 1991, 111; Gundersen 1994, 295). In a similar way, scholars have shown how social elements such as culture, identity, and routines shape the adoption and implementation of practices of deterrence by punishment in different contexts (Basrur 2006, 49–79; Knopf 2013; Lupovici 2016; Adamsky 2017, 166–71). However, similar questions could be asked about deterrence by denial (e.g., Målksoo 2021): for example, whether deterrence by denial allows actors to maintain their prestige and status in the same manner as deterrence through punishment and retaliation.\n## Conceptual Ambiguity\nThe challenge of conceptual ambiguity arises from the various kinds of means of employing the strategy of deterrence by denial and from the difficulty of clearly distinguishing between deterrence by denial and deterrence by punishment.\n## Multiple Strategies\nWhile scholars who explored deterrence by denial originally tended to regard it as based primarily on defensive measures (e.g., Buzan 1987, 135), recent studies agree that deterrence by denial can be achieved in various ways (Zilincik and Sweijs 2023). As Borghard and Lonergan (2023, 541) argue, “While defense can be one mechanism that contributes to deterrence by denial, it is not the only—or even primary—means of achieving denial.” More recent scholarship has also pointed to different means to practice deterrence by denial, such as de-legitimization (Gearson 2012, 183; Stein Gross and Levi 2015, 416), resilience (Nye 2017, 56; Libicki 2021, 205), and law enforcement activities (Borghard and Lonergan 2023, 553); as well as long-term effects based on repeated failures at both strategic and tactical levels (Tor 2017, 108; Wilner 2021, 50–1).\nAlthough it is important to acknowledge the different means through which actors can operate deterrence by denial, a more comprehensive framework would provide a systematic way to categorize the various types of deterrence and thus to effectively compare and contrast among strategies of deterrence by denial and deterrence by punishment. This would also be important given the need to elucidate the conditions under which this strategy works (or is adopted). In other words, it would help to show whether different conditions are necessary for success for different sub-categories of deterrence by denial.\n## Overlap of “Costs”\nAs Wilner and Wenger (2021, 7) observe, scholars suggest that the effect of deterrence by punishment is achieved by fear of retaliation, and the deterrent effect of deterrence by denial is achieved by fear of failure (see also von Hlatky 2015, 4). While they aptly summarize the scholarship, I suggest that the distinction between deterrence by punishment and deterrence by denial is not as clear as many scholars assume.\nFirst, as Buzan (1987, 135), for example, has noted, “[I]n military terms, denial and defense have virtually identical meanings. Those who treat deterrence and defence as alternatives are assuming that deterrence is likewise synonymous with retaliation.” According to Buzan (1987, 136), since the purpose of deterrence is to prevent “unwanted actions before they occur... [L]ogically, therefore the concept of deterrence encompasses both denial and retaliation” (italics in original).\n3 While Buzan (1987) is correct to suggest that defense and denial are both methods of deterrence, along with the threat of punishment (retaliation), it should also be noted that Buzan limits his discussion to military strategies. This is\nHowever, the concern runs even deeper. The question is not whether punishment, denial, and defense should or could be seen as different methods of deterrence. Rather, what is in question is the attempt to fully distinguish between deterrence by punishment and deterrence by denial through the distinction between emphasizing costs for the putative challenger (deterrence by punishment) and emphasizing the challenger's ability to attain its goal (deterrence by denial).\nWhile fear—of failure and of inability to achieve a goal—is a constitutive element of deterrence by denial, it is only part of the deterrent mechanism. It can be suggested that “costs” also play an important role in the practices of deterrence by denial. While certain scholars do acknowledge this argument (e.g. Nye 2017, 56; Brantly 2018, 35; Mazarr 2018, 6; Sawyer 2021, 111; Matania and Bachrach 2023), some see it as being of limited importance. Gross Stein and Levi (2015, 411), for example, argue that the tactics of deterrence by denial “play principally on increasing the likelihood of failure, and only indirectly on cost.”\nThe point, however, is that effective deterrence may be attained by making it clear to the putative challengers that executing the undesired activity will be costly not because of retaliation but rather because of the costs involved in executing it. These are the potential costs the putative challenger would have to invest to acquire the means and carry out the unwanted action. When the costs associated with an activity the defender tries to prevent are low, it will be difficult to convince the putative challenger to avoid using or acquiring these means. In such cases, the challenger has little to lose even if the chances of success are also low. In contrast, increasing the putative challenger's costs could result in effective deterrence by denial. The deterrer actor does not have to make the undesired activity impossible to achieve but can influence the challenger's calculations by manipulating the costs of developing the undesired activity and executing it. Libicki (2021, 192), for example, asserts that a potential challenger needs to take into account\n> the relationship between the resources that must be invested to mount an attack and the resources that are expended to carry out an attack. If the latter are low, then having already decided to make the necessary investments, the decision to use them is likely to be influenced by the prospect of and losses from retaliation—but if the expected costs from retaliation are themselves low, the prospect of failure is likely to be of but modest importance because mounting the attack costs little.\nAlthough some scholars acknowledge this aspect of cost—which in fact challenges the clear distinction between deterrence by punishment and deterrence by denial—this insight has only marginally contributed to the (re)conceptualization of deterrence by denial: for example, in systematically considering the various costs the putative challenger may face in light of different strategies of deterrence. In other words, the distinguishing criteria of whether the deterrent threat aims to influence the challengers' perception of costs or of chances of success are not the most effective. For both strategies of deterrence—by punishment and by denial—the costs inflicted or manipulated by the defender have a significant influence on deterrence success.\n## Mapping Deterrence Strategies\nTo address the challenges discussed in the previous section, I offer a new categorization of deterrence to better conceptualize its diverse types. This categorization is based on two interrelated elements: the means the deterrer uses to threaten the putative challenger and the timing of their use.\nFor the first element, I distinguish between two main types of deterrent means: means based on offensive military capability and non-offensive means. Offensive\nAMIR LUPOVICI\nmeans are all those weapons that are used or threatened to be used to cause physical harm to an opponent. Non-offensive means are all the other means. Non-offensive means could obviously be defensive measures, but they could also be various other means that limit the damage, limit the challenger's benefits from the damage, prevent the challenger from translating the successful challenge into a meaningful achievement, or (threaten) to cause non-material costs for the putative challenger, such as through de-legitimization, shaming, and stigmatization.\nThe second element is the potential timing of the employment of the deterrent measures. Obviously, any measure needs advance preparation, development, and acquirement, as well as communication of its existence to the putative challenger. Nonetheless, a key question is whether the threat is of a measure that will be employed before or after the undesired activity occurs. Some measures are employed mainly in advance, before the unwanted activity takes place, while others are employed after the unwanted activity takes place. While issuing the threatening message occurs before the unwanted activity, it could rely on means that, if needed, will be exercised only after an unwanted activity would occur, for example, retaliation. Thus, the deterrent effect—if successful—is achieved by an opponent's understanding that these means will follow the undesired activity. Conversely, for some other deterrent measures, the deterrent effect is achieved by the putative challenger's understanding that the deterrent means are already exercised, such as in the case of walls or norm building.\nBased on this, I distinguish among four types of strategies of deterrence (see table 1).\n## Deterrence through Offensive Means Used before the Execution of the Undesired Activity\nActors use offensive means in a number of ways prior to the putative unwanted activity in order to deter it.\n## Denial Capabilities\nActors may threaten to use offensive means prior to the execution of the undesired activity to establish their ability to deny the effect of the potential challenge and thus signal to the putative challenger that it is a worthless endeavor. The idea behind this strategy is not just to physically eliminate the capabilities of the opponent, as evident in defensive strategies, but also to signal to the challenger that allocating resources to this goal is too costly given that the goal may not be accomplished. As Sawyer (2021, 111) argues,\n4My categorization is inspired by Wirtz (2021, 127–8), who acknowledges the various ways to attain deterrence thorough retaliation, punishment, and denial and distinguishes among three ways of using offensive means for deterrence by denial: “(1) threats to launch preemptive attack or preventive war to deny the opponent military capability to launch an attack; (2) threats to defeat an attack where and when it occurs…or (3) threats to eliminate the ‘bone of contention’,” thus temporary success will not lead to a political gain. However, there are a number of differences between his discussion and my framework. First, I more directly offer a systematic way to distinguish between the offensive means by putting forward the timing of their use. Second, I contrast these offensive strategies with non-offensive ones as part of the systematic categorization. Lastly, Wirtz limits his discussion to attempts to deter territorial changes.\n5My categorization is also inspired by Smith and Talbot (2008, 56–9), who distinguish among different levels of deterrence by denial: tactical, operational, and strategic. These, respectively, concern means used to prevent the act of terrorism, means that aim to prevent terrorist capabilities, and means of preventing the goals the terrorists pursue. As such, their study overlaps with the categorization suggested in this article, as timing plays a significant role in both. Nonetheless, Smith and Talbot’s categorizations also differ considerably from mine. First, Smith and Talbot focus specifically on deterring terrorism, while I use the categorization to explore various unwanted activities. Second, and more importantly, I focus on the timing of the employment of the means the deterrer actor uses, while their classification concerns the timing of the effect of the deterrence strategy. As a result, the offered categorization allows us to better compare deterrence by denial and deterrence by punishment and thus to better grasp these two types of strategies. The suggested categorization also overlaps with Zilincik and Sweijs (2023), who distinguish between different timings—before, during, and after an attack. Nonetheless, not only does their research focus on denial strategies and not on strategies of deterrence, but as a result, they also rely on different timing and consider different categories. Furthermore, their main goal is to examine the emotional effects of different denial strategies.\n8\nDeterrence through Inflicting Costs\nTable 1. Categorization of deterrence strategies\n|  Timing of use of deterrent means | The means the deterrer actor uses  |   |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|   |  Offensive measures | Non-offensive measures  |\n|  Before the execution of the undesired activity | • Denial of opponent’s capabilities\n• “Defend Forward” | • Resilience\n• De-legitimization\n• Passive defensive measures (e.g., walls)\n• “Spoofing”  |\n|  After the execution of the undesired activity | • Retaliation\n• Denying military achievements | • Active defensive systems (e.g., anti-ballistic missiles)\n• Prevention of the benefit of the undesired activity  |\nCapability denial, when defined as restricting the adversary’s access to resources required for the targeted behavior, is largely indistinguishable from an offensive strategy aimed at eliminating the adversary’s capability. However, when it is defined as strategic communication intended to alter perceptions about the availability and acquisition costs for necessary resources ... it too is a case of dissuasion.\nThis strategy is evident in threats to make a preventive or preemptive strike in a way that denies the challenger’s military option (Wirtz 2021, 127). The idea is that these strikes will not just physically prevent the challenger’s ability to perform the unwanted action but will also signal that developing such an option is a useless effort.\nSome of Israel’s operations can be understood in this context. While Israel has traditionally emphasized the strategy of deterrence by punishment (Adamsky 2017), its offensive capabilities are also used for deterrence by denial (Inbar and Sandler 1993, 322). One example is the destruction in 2007 of a nuclear reactor, secretly built in the Deir ez-Zor region in eastern Syria. While the attack was carried out through a covert airstrike to reduce the chances of an escalation, its details were officially revealed a few years later (Matania and Bachrach 2023, 13–4). Although some scholars, such as Bar (2020, 332), see Israel’s preventive and preemptive strikes as part of establishing deterrence by punishment (and cumulative deterrence), another message is being implicitly delivered: that is, allocating resources to the goals of developing nuclear capabilities will be worthless given Israel’s ability and will to eliminate them in advance (Matania and Bachrach 2023, 21). As a result, they not only deny the challenger’s ability to acquire nuclear capabilities that would challenge Israel, but they also demonstrate the involved costs for the putative challenger to invest in such an allegedly pointless endeavor. In a similar way, the operation that started in late 2018 to destroy the tunnels Hizbullah mined from Southern parts of Lebanon into Israeli territory to invade Israel was not just to eliminate Hizbullah’s capabilities: It also had a deterrent message referring to the heavy costs and resources Hizbullah put into this project, especially given the difficulties of digging in the rocky ground of the Galilee (Matania and Bachrach 2023, 23). While Israel made no prior attempts to deter Hizbullah from establishing these tunnels, the destruction aimed, among other things, to send a deterrent message in order to affect Hizbullah’s future behavior. Again, it should be emphasized that in these cases, the\nAMIR LUPOVICI\ndeterrent mechanism concerns not just the inability to succeed but also the costs associated with committing to the challenge and preparing for it.\n## Defend Forward\nThe cyber domain provides some interesting examples of this strategy based on the advance use of offensive means. For example, while there is some ambiguity regarding whether \"defend forward\" is a strategy of deterrence (by punishment) or a departure from it (Fischerkeller and Harknett 2017; King and Gallagher 2020, 27–8; Whyte 2020, 210), some scholars have interpreted the US reliance on defend forward as a strategy that is based on denial through offensive means (Sweijs and Zilincik 2020, 148). As Borghard and Lonergan (2023) argue, \"Elements of the DoD's concept of defend forward resonate with a deterrence by denial strategy, specifically those aspects that are focused on counter-cyber operations to disrupt, deny, or degrade adversary offensive capabilities and infrastructure.\" The Department of Defense Cyber Strategy (DoD 2018, 1) clearly states, \"We will defend forward to disrupt or halt malicious cyber activity at its source, including activity that falls below the level of armed conflict.\" The deterrent message was described by General Paul Nakasone, Commander of US Cyber Command and Director of the National Security Agency, in the February 2019 Congressional testimony, in which he argued that these efforts could increase the costs of opponents' military actions through \"craft[ing] tools and tactics to frustrate their efforts\" (in Borghard and Lonergan 2023, 561). He echoes the idea that deterrence by denial aims to influence an opponent not just by affecting the putative challenger's estimations of success, but also by increasing the costs of conducting the undesired activity.\n## Deterrence through Threatening to Use Offensive Means after the Execution of the Undesired Activity\nDeterring threats may also refer—and often do—to threats that will be implemented if the unwanted activity were to occur. In contrast to the first category, which refers to deterrent means that are operated prior to the execution of the unwanted activity, in this category the timing of using the deterrent means is after the execution of the unwanted activity—that is if the unwanted activity has already occurred.\n## Deterrence by Retaliation\nThis strategy is evident most clearly in cases of deterrence by punishment, where the defender threatens to retaliate—that is the threat is to use offensive means after an unwanted activity occurred—in order to convince a putative challenger to avoid it. The fundamental idea of this strategy is that credibly threatening a putative challenger with a retaliation would lead the challenger to avoid the undesired behavior, at least if the cost of punishment would exceed any potential gain (e.g., George and Smoke 1974; Morgan 2003, 1–25). As noted above, this idea has been widely developed in the context of nuclear deterrence, but it has also shaped strategies based on different offensive means, including, in recent years, cyber deterrence (e.g., in Wilner 2020, 252–4). The idea is that if deterrence works, actors will avoid challenging a deterrer actor because of the costs the retaliation would pose. For this reason, and acknowledging the limited availability of cyber targets that would allow deterrers to impose high costs on putative challengers, actors are advised to retaliate against cyberattacks not only with cyber means but also with traditional military kinetic means (e.g., Kugler 2009, 328; Schneider 2019).\n## Denial of Achievements\nThreatening to use offensive means after the challenger has executed the unwanted activity could also characterize situations of deterrence by denial (Buzan 1987, 136; Vanaga 2019, 171). Most prominently, this is the idea behind conventional military\n10\nDeterrence through Inflicting Costs\ndifference. Indeed, as Luttwak (1985, 3) notes, traditionally “the continuous deterrence generated by military force was generally treated as a bonus gain,” and their main goal was winning the war. Nonetheless, acquiring military capabilities had the advantage of not only providing a remedy for cases of an attack (and thus deterrence failure), but also affecting the putative challenger’s calculations about their chances of success. For this reason, Mazarr (2018, 2) argues that a useful way to estimate the effectiveness of deterrence by denial is to examine the “immediate balance of forces in the contested territory.” This clearly emphasizes that the costs the putative challenger may need to pay concern not just situations of deterrence by punishment but also situations of deterrence by denial. Obviously, attacking an opponent capable of defending will increase the costs for a putative challenger, not just because of retaliation but also because of the costs of waging the war, even if the challenger could win it. As Mazarr (2018, 6) notes, “Even if an attacker believes it might be successful in such cases, the costs of a long and painful war are a powerful preventive deterrent.”\n## Deterrence through Non-Offensive Means Used before the Execution of the Undesired Activity\nNon-offensive means could also be used for deterrent purposes, both prior to and following the execution of the unwanted activity of a challenger. Those used prior to the unwanted activity include a variety of strategies to threaten an opponent, such as de-legitimization, establishing resilience, and passive defense means such as establishing walls. This non-offensive deterrent means by denial work through limiting the potential damage of the undesired activity either by preventing the damage or by preventing the challenger’s ability to translate the undesired activity into meaningful damage. Exercising these means becomes part of the deterrent message the defender issues to the putative challenger.\n## De-Legitimization\nA number of scholars have pointed to de-legitimization as an effective means of deterrence by denial, especially against terrorism (Gearson 2012, 183). According to Stein Gross and Levi (2015, 417), “[T]he purpose is to manipulate the social rewards of prohibited action.” In their discussion, they rely on Wilner (2011, 26), who asserts, “[T]he objective is to reduce the challenger’s probability of achieving his goals by attacking the legitimacy of the beliefs that inform his behavior.” This strategy aims to influence the putative challenger’s perception of success—their ability to translate an attack into a political victory. Nonetheless, this strategy also relates to costs the putative challenger would pay in three meaningful ways. First, this means of deterrence through de-legitimization is partly based on the political costs the challenger will pay in their domestic arena (see also Wilner 2011, 27). Second, on the top of these costs are the direct costs associated with the means required to prepare and execute the undesired activity. Third, this strategy undermines the ability of the putative challenger to mobilize support, which also affects its available resources. In this respect, this creates costs, prevents gains, and denies its (future) capabilities.⁶\nNonetheless, the connections between de-legitimization and deterrence by denial success are complicated. On the one hand, there is some evidence that successful de-legitimization does not necessarily lead to effective deterrence. For example, Turkey successfully delegitimized the PKK (Kurdistan Workers’ Party) in the early 2000s, convincing many Western countries that it is a terror organization. However, while this successful de-legitimization had some effects on the PKK’s ability to mobilize resources and support (e.g., Casier 2010), it also “resulted in recurrence of\n⁶According to Stein Gross and Levi (2015, 416–7) and based on criminological research, deterrence by denial through de-legitimization can be based on three different audiences that affect the potential risks and rewards of the terrorists: formal authorities (law enforcement), social bonds, and informal control.\nold practices, including its default to violence” (Gürcan and Coşar Ünal 2018, 194). Conversely, some scholars have provided evidence to demonstrate terror organization leaders' sensitivity to legitimacy. For example, Knopf considers a message sent by the number two leader of al Qaeda, at the time, Ayman al-Zawahari, to the leader of this organization in Iraq, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, in which Zawahari “instructed Zarqawi that his methods, including indiscriminate attacks on Muslim civilians and the release of videos showing hostage beheadings, were so excessive they had become counterproductive.” According to Zawahiri, ‘the strongest weapon which the mujahadeen enjoys .... is popular support from the Muslim masses ... [meaning] the mujahed movement must avoid any action that the masses do not understand or approve'” (Knopf 2010, 18, ftn, 92).\nDe-legitimization is also used to deter threats other than terrorism, such as deterring cyberattacks through the development of norms (Stevens 2012, 159; Nye 2017, 60--2), in this way increasing the costs the challenger would pay with regard to different audiences (Wilner 2020, 255). As Soesanto and Smeets argue, “the creation of norms and rules for state behaviour in cyberspace, will over time translate into a general principle of restraint, raise the reputational costs of bad behaviour” (Soesanto and Smeets 2020, 393).\nThis strategy is similarly used to deter attacks in outer space. According to Mckeown and Wilner (2020), one of the means to deter an attack on US satellites is through de-legitimization, which is based on “developing ‘norms of responsible behaviour' in outer space (so as to diplomatically isolate those who would break them)” (Mckeown and Wilner 2020, 401). In fact, some official reports, such as from the US Department of Defense (2014), have pointed to the need to rely on this strategy, recommending the “development of international norms of responsible behavior that enhance safety, security, and stability in space.” According to the report, advancing these norms can have “a positive effect on deterrence; even if potential adversaries are not deterred from conducting hostile or malicious acts in space, norms can help the international community identify and isolate aggressors” (DoD 2014).\nThis example thus captures both elements of deterrence by denial and of deterrence by punishment. On the one hand, it concerns the prevention of challengers' ability to translate a successful challenge into a meaningful political achievement. In situations where such norms are strong, domestic and international audiences will prevent the putative challenger from making it a political victory. On the other hand, it also concerns deterrence by punishment, especially since the putative challenger's fear is not just of material costs associated with the punishment, but also of psychological and social costs (Sweijs and Zilincik 2020, 149--50).\nThe logic of the nuclear taboo and the emergence of normative limits to the use of nuclear weapons increase the costs of using them and thus create self-deterrence mechanisms that also overlap with both deterrence by denial and deterrence by punishment. As Tannenwald argues, while taboos affect behavior in a number of ways, some of them rely on a deterrent effect achieved by increasing domestic and international public opinion costs (Tannenwald 2007, 48--9; see also Nye 2017, 60). According to her, the norm of the taboo has not only had a significant and direct impact on the avoidance of using nuclear weapons over the years, but it has also enhanced nuclear deterrence, and thus increased the costs decision-makers would pay if they used nuclear weapons in a first strike (Tannenwald 2007, 45). In this respect, policymakers' awareness of the norm, according to Tannenwald (2007), has dissuaded them from using these weapons.\n### Establishing Resilience\nThe demonstration of resilience is another way actors can exercise deterrence by denial with non-offensive measures prior to the execution of the undesired activity.\nDefenders demonstrate and communicate to a potential challenger that they will not be able to translate the execution of the undesired activity, even if successful, into a meaningful political benefit (Gearson 2012; Libicki 2021, 205). Resilience can be used in various contexts in multiple domains of competition and vis-à-vis different kinds of challenging actors: state and non-state (Sweijs and Zilincik 2020, 148). In addition, it can be employed with different means. For example, resilience can be achieved through technological solutions, such as backup and recovery systems in case of cyberattacks (Nye 2017, 56). Actors can also rely on developing procedures and routines to better prepare for absorbing undesired activities such as terror attacks, for example, by educating the public about such situations. Gearson (2012, 191) suggests that “[b]y demonstrating that a society is resilient and well prepared for dislocations and shock, with intelligent design and disaster recovery procedures embedded into government and private sector behaviour, the target communities will also be reassured and confident of recovery.” Furthermore, effective use of resilience mechanisms may create substantial costs for the putative challenger, implying that investing efforts in targeting the defender is not a wise decision for allocating resources. As Nye (2017, 56) suggests regarding these means, “Attackers have limited resources and time; therefore, driving up the costs can deter attacks.”\n### Defensive Means\nStrategies of deterrence by denial also rely on defensive means that could be used or employed before the execution of the undesired activity (e.g. Goldgeier and Wojtowicz. 2022, 5), including walls and fortifications. Cioffi-Revilla (1999), for example, uses archeological evidence from different regions to demonstrate that deterrence by denial was used thousands of years ago. According to him, massive walls “signal significant material capacity and likely organizational know-how to implement deterrence by denial” (Cioffi-Revilla 1999, 247). These walls are also used in modern times with varying degrees of success, including against armies and terror attacks (Naroll et al. 1974, Brantly 2018, 35) and even against migrants (Kent et al. 2020, 856, 864). The intention in these cases is to deter by signaling to individuals and armies that they will not be able to achieve their desired goals or that they will need to invest substantial resources toward it. Findings from migration scholarship show that while walls decrease the number of people who cross these specific areas, the numbers often increase in other areas (Kent et al. 2020, 871). This echoes the point about the interrelated effects of the costs and chances of success in executing an action a deterrer actor attempts to prevent. Lastly, passive defense measures like “civil defense” are also based on non-military means that serve deterrence by denial, such as using shelters or evacuating populations in certain scenarios. These measures are used prior to the occurrence of the unwanted activity (Freedman 2004, 37). While such measures can also be costly for the defender, they significantly limit the potential gain a putative challenger can make from executing the unwanted activity, and thus may decrease its attractiveness.\nSome cyber defensive measures may seem similar to traditional security means: for example, (fire-)walls, which are used to harden cyber targets and defend against cyberattacks and thus could have deterrent effect (Nye 2017, 56). Cyber technologies provide some other unique ways to use this type of strategy, for example, by remodeling the cyber terrain. This may enhance cyber defense and thus has deterrence by denial effects (Matania and Tal-Shir 2020, 292).\n### Spoofing\nPlanting dummy targets makes the execution of the unwanted activity more costly and thus can be used as a strategy of deterrence by denial. The rationale is that planting dummy targets increases the potential future efforts and costs the putative challengers need to invest since resources have to be allocated to identify the real\nAMIR LUPOVICI\n13\ntargets. An example of this kind of deterrence is evident in protecting maritime vessels. According to Gutman and Rojkes Dombe (2017), defenders may exercise this strategy through electronic means that signal locations of alleged vessels that do not really exist. As they note, “planting hundreds of military dummy targets, through the AIS [Automatic Identification System] protocol, into the status picture of defending side’s coastal layout” creates a deterrence by denial effect, dissuading an opponent from going out to sea to begin with (Gutman and Rojkes Dombe 2017). While powerful actors, such as the United States, may have resources and various capabilities that allow them to exactly trace the location of vessels—such as through intelligence, reconnaissance, and surveillance assets (e.g., Mirski 2013, 406)—not all putative challengers have access to these capabilities.\nAnother example is the music industry’s attempt in the early 2000s to deter the sharing of media files through streaming services such as Napster. Various measures were used to complicate access to these files and thus to deter potential users (Pesta 2004, 406–10; Jennings and Bossler 2020). Spoofing was one of these methods, where copyright holders uploaded corrupted files, including fake music files, that provided computer users with “static, popping, cracking noises, or silence instead of the unauthorized music file they were attempting to download” (Pesta 2004, 408–9). The industry even hired some companies to distribute these fake files (Segal 2002). The explicit aim of these attempts was to create a deterrent effect: Given the time and costs of downloading files in the early 2000s, the attractiveness of this activity was lessened by actors’ knowledge that there was a good chance the file would be corrupted. In the end, the deterrent effect was aimed to be achieved by reducing the likelihood of success of downloading the media files. Nonetheless, the strategy also emphasizes the importance of “costs” for deterrence by denial. If there were no costs to downloading the music—internet costs, time invested in searching for the files, the annoyance of downloading a corrupted file—then there would be no deterrent effect. Interestingly, as Jennings and Bossler (2020, 1038–9) note, this strategy had little deterrent effect because the corrupted files were identified and so users could avoid them.\n## Deterrence through Threatening to Use Non-Offensive Means after the Execution of the Undesired Activity\nLastly, actors could threaten to use non-offensive measures after absorbing the undesired activity. Most commonly, this could be done through threatening to use defensive measures to deny the effectiveness of the challenge, for example, thorough “anti-aircraft or anti-ballistic missile systems designed to bring down the enemy offensive before any targets were reached” (Freedman 2004, 37). Clearly, the defender needs to have these capabilities as well as to communicate them to the putative challenger to dissuade the unwanted action (see also Golov 2016, 89).\nAn effective deterrence by denial carries the message that preparing and executing the challenge would be costly because the resources allocated would not be worth it. As Sawyer (2021, 111) notes, “Tactical denial—communication about target-hardening efforts—conveys the adversary that it must adopt new tactics, which are likely to increase the cost or uncertainty of action in the short term.” Denial could be established on defensive components in such a way that “an adver\n7Scholars have pointed to a number of challenges concerning this strategy: for example, the limited credibility of reliance on defensive systems for deterrence, especially given the limited “margin of error” (Freedman 2004, 37), their costs (Adamsky 2021, 184), the challenges they create for deterrence by punishment (Adamsky 2021, 185), and the incentives they may give to a putative challenger in order to exhaust the defensive systems budget (Brantly 2018, 36). For a review of strategic negative implications of defensive systems on deterrence, see Quackenbush (2006, 533), who nonetheless contends that these systems eventually enhance deterrence success (Quackenbush 2006, but see Golov 2016).\nsary cannot go on the offense without incurring significant costs” (Borghard and Lonergan 2017, 474). This view is part of how Katagiri (2021), who focuses on deterrence through defensive means, defines deterrence by denial. According to him, it is the “ability to deny actions and persuade the opponent that it is unlikely to attain its immediate objectives at a reasonable cost” (Katagiri 2021, 203, my emphasis). This means that defensive measures may increase the costs for a putative challenger to execute the attack and thus, as in deterrence by punishment, may affect not only their chance of success but also their costs of planning, developing, and executing the challenge.\nTo take a more concrete example, Israel in recent years has shifted its strategy, relying increasingly on active defense systems to cover various types of threats, including the Iron Dome missile defense batteries that aim to intercept short-range rockets and the Arrow system that aims to intercept long-range missiles. Although skeptical about how effective these defensive measures are in creating successful deterrence, Adamsky (2021, 178--81) acknowledges that the changes in the strategic environment “produced a much stronger emphasis on defense in Israeli national security, and thus somewhat expanded the role of deterrence by denial in Israel strategic thought.”\nActive defense systems are also used for deterrence by denial strategies to dissuade cyberattacks. While the question remains as to whether these defensive systems could effectively provide defense or deterrence by denial, a number of scholars suggest this at least as a theoretical option (Borghard and Lonergan 2023, 534-5). Schneider (2019, 113), for example, argues that “cyber defense” could be achieved through “securing nodes of civilian and military networks” such as space-based satellites and optic cables. The point, however, is that while cyber infrastructures could be defended with passive means, they could also be defended by active defense measures, including kinetic means such as ballistic missiles, as part of a cross-domain deterrence.\nHowever, non-offensive means do not necessarily need to be military ones. For example, policies of deterrence to prevent immigration rely on means used after the perceived unwanted activity occurs such as detaining immigrants, preventing social benefits and work rights, and reducing access to legal due process (Kent et al. 2020, 856). All these means are characterized by being employed after the unwanted action has taken place—the immigrants have already entered a country whose government aims to deter immigration. The idea behind these deterrent policies is to demonstrate to potential immigrants that they will not be able to succeed: for example, they will be unable to work in the target country. This negates the value of the costs invested in the immigration process and in the efforts to immigrate into their territories.\n## Toward a Revised Theory of Deterrence by Denial\nThe discussion so far demonstrates that while deterrence by punishment and deterrence by denial can be contrasted if we consider them through their strategic goals, overlaps can be seen by looking at the strategies' means as well as their timing. For example, both deterrence by denial and deterrence by punishment could be established by using offensive means, even those used after the execution of the challenge. The discussion also shows that inflicting costs is a significant element not only of deterrence by punishment but also of deterrence by denial. The strategy of deterrence by denial involves mechanisms that can increase the costs for the putative challenger, including costs associated with resources to prepare for and conduct the undesired activity. Some strategies of deterrence by denial concern other\nkinds of costs, such as costs the actor may pay in domestic and international arenas about its legitimization, which can affect its ability (and motivation) to execute the undesired activity. Taking these elements together, and acknowledging the overlap between deterrence by punishment and deterrence by denial, opens a path to further theorize deterrence by denial. Furthermore, acknowledging the overlap may lead a more general theory of deterrence to account for both types of deterrence.\nWhile it is beyond the scope of this article to cover all the factors accounting for the success of deterrence by denial, taking steps toward this goal could prove useful to demonstrate the advantages of the suggested conceptualization when it comes to explaining deterrence success and considering the adoption of the strategy.\n### Deterrence Success—The Balance of Costs\nAs demonstrated above, different means of both deterrence by punishment and deterrence by denial may incur costs in various ways for putative challengers. It follows then that a key concept in accounting for deterrence success (of deterrence by either punishment or denial) is the balance of costs. When the costs to the putative challenger of executing the challenge are low—because the cost of expected retaliation is low, because the costs of the means for the attack are low, because the costs of executing the attack are low, and/or because the domestic audience supports paying these costs—the challenge will be much more difficult to successfully deter. Similarly, when acquiring or using the means of deterrence is costly for the defender, it is difficult to threaten using them as deterrents (see also Matania and Bachrach 2023).\nThis was exactly the situation with Israel's reliance on defensive measures to deter Hamas rockets launched from Gaza using the Iron Dome system. The costs for Hamas were between 500 and 1,000 US dollars per Katyusha rocket, while each intercepting missile costs 50,000 and a battery of Iron Dome costs around 100 million US dollars (Brantly 2018, 36). Although the costs for Israel in a situation without any defensive measures might be much higher given the potential damage these rockets can do, this system's deterrent effect in preventing these attacks is very limited. In fact, some have pointed out that these unbalanced costs may incentivize Hamas to challenge Israel to erode its security budget. This is why former Israeli Prime Minister, Naftali Bennet (2022), declared that Israel is developing a defense system based on laser technology: To change “[t]he economic equation ... If it is possible to intercept a missile or rocket with just an electric pulse that costs a few dollars, we will have nullified the ring of fire that Iran has set up on our borders. The whole thing no longer pays off.”\nIn contrast, in other cases, the deterrer actors may be the ones who enjoy the “balance of costs.” An interesting example is provided by Lior Div, the CEO of Cybereason, a cyber security company. Although he does not refer to the concept of deterrence by denial, he clearly demonstrates this logic when discussing the SolarWinds attack. This was a serious cyberattack, likely sponsored by a foreign government, that infected numerous computers in the United States in late 2020, including nine government agencies and a hundred private companies. In an interview, Div noted that “SolarWinds attackers scanned networks to determine if Cybereason's software was installed. If they saw that it was present, they bypassed it and moved along to another network” (Levy 2021). Given the system's past successes, the hackers did not want it to gather information on their malicious code. This is an example of deterrence by denial based on the challenger's fear that the system could effectively detect and neutralize the attack and thus render the efforts invested in the malicious code useless. More generally, while not entirely deterring the use of this attack and not using fear of retaliation, the Cybereason system effectively deterred by denial the attack on the computers on which it operated.\nAnother important factor affecting the balance of costs, and thus deterrence success, is the cost for the putative challenger of identifying relevant targets and knowing how costly it would be to execute the challenge: for example, in case of defensive missiles, how costly it would be for a putative challenger to identify areas the system cannot fully cover, or, similarly, in the case of building walls, how costly (how many resources it would take) it would be for immigrants to identify alternative routes to those blocked by walls. It could be that these latter costs are not high, as evidence shows that while walls have a deterrent effect, the number of those crossing in areas without walls increases (Kent et al. 2020, 871). Another example is in the case of spoofing. As noted above, the costs of identifying the fake media files were very low (Jennings and Bossler 2020, 1038--9), which led to deterrence failure. Nonetheless, planting dummy targets at sea seems a much more effective strategy given that many actors do not have access to measures that allow them to identify the real targets, thus significantly increasing their costs to distinguish between real and faked ones (Gutman and Rojkes Dombe 2017).\nThe cost of knowing is also affected by another factor; that is, the costs to execute the activity the defender aims to prevent. When the costs to execute the unwanted activity are very low, the costs of knowing become less important, since a putative challenger may easily challenge many possible targets. For example, as noted above, when the cost for launching rockets is low, as in the case of the rockets Hamas launches against Israel (Brantly 2018, 36), putative challengers do not need to invest many resources into identifying alternative targets, thus indicating the limited effectiveness of deterrence by denial.\nThe costs of knowing are also relevant for deterrence by punishment. In some cases, deterrer actors, indeed, clearly state what the costs would be for executing the unwanted behavior and what would be considered as such a behavior. Nonetheless, in many other cases, the deterrent threat includes ambiguities (see Crawford 2003, 11--2) that force the putative challenger to invest resources in identifying the structure of costs. In terms of the balance of costs, this adds another layer and trade-off of costs affecting deterrence success.\nLastly, the balance of costs may also be affected by different mechanisms and means operated at different times. This is because a deterrent means may incur additional costs at times other than when they are exercised. Acknowledging the different categories presented above, which refer to different timings at which the deterrent means are exercised, may thus point to other ways to enhance the deterrent threat. For example, as discussed above, building norms is a non-offensive deterrent means used prior to the execution of the unwanted activity. Its effectiveness stems from policymakers' sensitivity to the domestic and international public opinion costs, and thus on their ability to translate the unwanted activity into a meaningful political achievement. However, while normative structures create a pre-condition for deterrence success, the deterrent effect may be enhanced by other mechanisms that could be exercised if an unwanted activity takes place, such as naming and shaming. Breaking norms inflict “a kind of social punishment on the normative transgressor. A loss of face amongst the international community is the likely outcome of such a naming and shaming exercise” (Ryan 2018, 337). In other words, naming and shaming practices allow an actor to translate the norm into a specific deterrent threat, and thus to incur more concrete costs (Schulz 2015, 41). Conversely, decision-makers who know that no one would translate the inappropriate behavior into costs would be less affected by the norm.\nFurthermore, these dynamics could also have future deterrent effects, even if they failed. In this respect, although exercising naming and shaming demonstrates deterrence failure, as neither the norm nor the possibility of naming and shaming dissuaded the unwanted activity, it may clarify the potential costs for future similar behavior. In addition, practicing naming and shaming may help mobilize opponents to this behavior, resulting in a future increase in the costs of the unwanted activity.\nAMIR LUPOVICI\n17\nIn this respect, these dynamics are similar to what is considered in the scholarship as cumulative deterrence, where the actual retaliation is used to clarify for putative challengers the capabilities and resolve of the defender (e.g., Stein 1996; Kello 2017, 209–11; Kirchofer 2017; Tor 2017).\n## Adoption of Deterrence Strategy\nIn addition, the overlap between deterrence by punishment and deterrence by denial could be used to elaborate on elements that affect the adoption of the strategy. The discussion above emphasizes not only the strategies the deterrer actor uses but also the means and timing. This provides a useful point of departure for asking questions about the reliance on deterrence strategies in general or about the exact type of deterrence, as well as about the specific means used for deterrence purposes. For example, cultural elements may explain actors’ reliance on non-offensive measures for deterrence. The case of Japan, given its culture and constitutional restrictions, is a key example of an actor that relies on deterrence by denial through defensive systems (Katagiri 2021). As Katagiri (2021, 207) explains, in addition to extended deterrence it receives, Japan’s doctrine is based on “defensive defence, which bans offensive use of force even in wartime. It means that defensive force can only be used in the event of a foreign attack and is limited to the minimum necessary for self-defence. Since the 1970s it has informed Japan’s deterrence-by-denial posture and affected weapons programs and operations.”\nIn a similar way, cultural and social elements may explain a state’s reliance on strategies of deterrence by punishment or deterrence by denial that mainly use offensive measures. For Israel, for example, reliance on the actual use of force as part of practicing deterrence, and especially cumulative deterrence, is a formative idea (Bar-Joseph 1998, 156–7; Almog 2004–5; Bar 2020, 324–5, 330–1). It is related not only to strategic elements, but also to cultural, social, and political ones (Sucharov 2005, 31, 68; Barnett 2013, 37–47; Lupovici 2016, 54). From this perspective, it matters little whether the strategy relies on deterrence by punishment or deterrence by denial. Rather, the important elements are the means used and the ability to employ them as part of a strategy of deterrence.\n## Conclusion\nIn this article, I offered a new way to distinguish among different types of deterrence strategies based on the means used for deterrent threats and the timing of when actors threaten to use them. I demonstrated each of the various types by considering examples from kinetic and cyber domains. I argue that using this categorization better captures the differences and overlapping of deterrence by punishment and deterrence by denial. In addition, viewing deterrence through these lenses also emphasizes that inflicting costs is a key aspect not only of deterrence by punishment but also of deterrence by denial.\nExploring these issues helps us to further theorize about deterrence by denial, whose study currently lags behind the research on deterrence by punishment. While this paper acknowledges this gap, it also offers and demonstrates a direction to close it by contextualizing the means deterrer actors use and recognizing that costs are an aspect common to both types of deterrence.\nI conclude by pointing to a broader research agenda derived from this research. First, this discussion helps us to reconsider how factors already acknowledged in deterrence scholarship may have different effects on the categories presented above. For example, scholars acknowledge the importance of communicating capabilities and intentions. Means used before defenders experience the challenge—either defensively or offensively—may communicate the threat more effectively than those employed only post-factum, as, for example, in the case of traditional deterrence\n18\nDeterrence through Inflicting Costs\nby punishment. Furthermore, thinking through this lens may inspire research on other factors affecting deterrence success. Second, and along with the previous point, this research allows us to consider, categorize, and explain different strategies of deterrence. For example, in recent years scholars have pointed to the strategy of threatening to reveal the identity of a putative challenger through the notion of deterrence by detection or by accusation (e.g., Lindsay and Gartzke 2018, 192; Finnemore and Hollis 2020, 980–1; Wilner 2020, 271). The framework suggested here would locate this strategy as a non-offensive means operated after the execution of the undesired action: for example, technological means will help to identify post-factum who committed the attack, but communicating this capability in advance could have a deterrent effect. Considering this strategy in this category allows us to develop specific factors to account for its failure or success and help us to better contrast it with other strategies of deterrence.\nAlso important in further developing explanations of deterrence success, as discussed above, is to focus on costs or the balance of costs. Again, one set of questions concerns how costs—and not just costs of a retaliatory strike—could be communicated, including communicating both the ability to inflict costs and the intention to use these capabilities. Furthermore, distinguishing among different types of costs inflicted at different points of time is also a promising direction for theorizing deterrence success, including that of deterrence by denial.\nThis categorization inspires additional questions about the adoption of the strategy. For example, scholars could explore whether actors prioritize some means for deterrent purposes over others, such as in the Japanese and Israeli cases briefly discussed above. Scholars could also ask more specific questions about key concepts, such as the cult of reputation (Tang 2005). For example, they could compare the effects of this cult on actors’ reliance on offensive and non-offensive means when they consider adopting or issuing a deterrent threat.\nFinally, on an empirical level, this framework offers a useful direction to explore cyber deterrence further. As noted above, while deterrence by denial seems a more effective strategy to address cyber security concerns, such research requires further theoretical development (e.g., Borghard and Lonergan 2023, 534-5). My research addresses this challenge by offering specific directions to explore cyber deterrence success (and its adoption). For example, the emphasis of this conceptual framework on “costs” is pertinent to exploring cyber security given the various costs involved for both the defender and the putative challenger. Likewise, cyber technologies could spark interesting debates on the distinction between offensive and non-offensive means both in thinking about deterrence success and in studying the adoption of the strategy. This is especially important given questions about what counts as offensive or violent means in the cyber domain, and thus what legitimizes a response and with what means (Lupovici 2019, 181)."

Despite its prominence, however, the scholarship on deterrence by denial stands to be developed further. It lags behind scholarship on deterrence by punishment on two points: in identifying the conditions under which the strategy works and in examining elements affecting its adoption. Deterrence by denial also carries some conceptual ambiguity since its employment takes many significantly different forms and also because it overlaps with deterrence by punishment. Despite the emphasis in current scholarship on\"inflicting costs\"as a defining element of deterrence by punishment, costs arguably also play a significant role in deterrence by denial. To address these challenges, I distinguish between deterrence strategies by focusing on two main elements: the means the deterrer actor threatens to use (offensive or non-offensive) and the timing of the threatened use of these means (before or after the unwanted activity). This offers a more nuanced distinction between deterrence strategies and better encompasses the role of inflicting costs in deterrence by denial. I suggest that this research offers a useful point of departure to further theorize about deterrence by denial, and it sets a promising research agenda that is pertinent given the growing interest in deterrence by denial, especially in its application to cyber deterrence.\nLa estrategia de disuasión por negación es ampliamente utilizada por diferentes agentes. Sin embargo, a pesar de su importancia, el conocimiento académico relativo a la disuasión por negación debe desarrollarse aún en mayor medida. El conocimiento académico relativo a la disuasión por negación se ha quedado atrasado en comparación con el conocimiento académico relativo a la disuasión por castigo en dos puntos: la identificación de las condiciones bajo las cuales funciona la estrategia y el estudio de los elementos que afectan su adopción. La disuasión por negación también conlleva cierta ambigüedad conceptual, ya que se utiliza de muchas formas, significativamente diferentes entre ellas, y también porque se solapa con la disuasión por castigo. A pesar del énfasis existente en el mundo académico actual en usar el hecho de «imponer costes» como un elemento definitorio de la disuasión por castigo, estos costes también juegan un papel importante en la disuasión por negación. Con el fin de abordar estos desafíos, hacemos una distinción entre ambas estrategias de disuasión centrándonos en dos elementos principales: los medios Lupovici, Amir.

Esto nos ofrece una distinción más matizada entre ambas estrategias de disuasión y engloba de una mejor forma el papel que juega el hecho de imponer costes dentro de la disuasión por negación. Sugerimos que esta investigación ofrece un punto de partida útil para teorizar de forma más profunda sobre la disuasión por negación, y establece una agenda de investigación prometedora, la cual resulta relevante debido al creciente interés en materia de la disuasión por negación, especialmente en su aplicación a la disuasión cibernética.\nLa stratégie de dissuasion par le déni est largement employée par divers acteurs. Néanmoins, malgré son importance, elle ne fait l'objet que de peu de travaux de recherche. Elle a du retard par rapport à la recherche sur la dissuasion par la punition à deux niveaux: quand il s'agit d'identifier les conditions de fonctionnement d'une stratégie et quand il s'agit d'analyser les éléments qui ont une incidence sur son adoption. La dissuasion par le déni s'accompagne également d'une certaine ambiguïté conceptuelle, car son emploi revêt des formes très différentes et elle a tendance à recouper la dissuasion par la punition. Malgré l'accent actuel des recherches sur les « coûts infligés » comme élément définitoire de la dissuasion par la punition, ceux-ci pourraient bien aussi jouer un rôle important dans la dissuasion par le déni. Pour répondre à ces défis, je distingue les stratégies de dissuasion en me concentrant sur deux éléments principaux: les moyens que l'acteur dissuasif menace d'utiliser (offensifs ou non) et la temporalité d'application de cette menace (avant ou après l'activité indésirable). Ainsi apparaît une distinction plus nuancée des stratégies de dissuasion, qui représente plus justement le rôle des coûts infligés dans la dissuasion par le déni. Selon moi, ce travail de recherche propose un point de départ utile quand il s'agit de pousser la théorisation de la dissuasion par le déni et un programme de recherche prometteur et pertinent, étant donné l'intérêt croissant pour la dissuasion par le déni, en particulier pour son application de cyberdissuasion.\nKeywords: deterrence, deterrence by denial Palabras clave: disuasión, disuasión por negación Mots clés: dissuasion, dissuasion par le déni # Introduction A key classical distinction in deterrence scholarship is between deterrence by punishment and deterrence by denial. Suggested as early as the late 1950s, this distinction in its original formulation focuses on whether the deterrent threat emphasizes the cost for the putative challengers if they execute the undesired activity (deterrence by punishment) or puts into question the challenger's ability to achieve its goals (deterrence by denial). As Wilner and Wenger (2021, 7) explain,\"[W]hereas punishment manipulates behavior by augmenting costs, denial works by stripping away benefits... so whereas punishment deters through the fear of pain, denial deters through the fear of failure.\"This distinction has been important for the emergence of deterrence research. Given the prominence of nuclear deterrence and its impact on this research, the concept of deterrence by punishment is conspicuous in how the study emerged.\nIt is only in recent years that the concept of deterrence by denial has started to attract greater attention (e.g., Smith and Talbot 2008; Gearson 2012; Brantly 2018; Adamsky 2021; Wenger and Wilner 2021; Zilincik and Swejs 2023; Borghard and Lonergan 2023). This shift is due mainly to changes in the threat environment—the advancement of new regional and global powers on the one hand, and the grow ing role of low-level conflicts, including terrorism and cyber conflicts, on the other. These changes have clarified the need for alternatives to the dominant strategy of deterrence by punishment. For example, some studies have suggested cyber deterrence by denial as an alternative because of the challenges of successfully implementing cyber deterrence by punishment, mainly the problem of attribution. In addition, organizational competencies and technological developments, such as the advancement of better defensive measures enhance the attractiveness of the strategy of deterrence by denial (e.g. Slayton 2017, 89--90; Lilli 2021, 171; Lupovici 2021, 1687).\nI argue, however, that despite the advantages of the concept of deterrence by denial, it can be further developed theoretically and clarified conceptually. Foremost, while there is a consensus among scholars regarding key factors affecting the success of deterrence by punishment, that is, capability, credibility, and communication (e.g. Morgan 2003, 15--20), much less has been theorized about the conditions under which deterrence by denial succeeds. Likewise, the research could also be developed with regard to studying the adoption of deterrence by denial. For example, while some studies have focused on the social and cultural elements affecting the adoption of deterrence by punishment, we know much less in this regard about the adoption of deterrence by denial strategies (but see Målksoo2021).\nSecond, deterrence by denial refers to various distinct mechanisms—such as defense, resilience, denial, and prevention—grouped under one category. This ambiguity not only reveals the need to clarify and map the sub-categories of deterrence by denial, but it also aggravates the challenge in studying the success of deterrence by denial—that is, in determining whether each sub-category of deterrence by denial is successful under the same conditions. In addition, and even more challenging, is the overlap between deterrence by punishment and deterrence by denial. As I discuss below, contrary to common wisdom that emphasizes the clear distinction between deterrence by punishment and deterrence by denial, both strategies concern the sensitivity of the putative challenger to “costs.” In other words, while I agree that deterrence by denial focuses on the fear of failure, this strategy is also affected by the manipulation of actors' sensitivity to “costs.” Therefore, inflicting “costs,” while considered a key element of deterrence by punishment, provides a limited borderline between deterrence by punishment and deterrence by denial since it plays a significant role in both kinds of deterrence. Some scholars have put this idea forward: for example, Brantly (2018, 35) clearly argues that both “[d]eterrence by punishment and denial are intended to manipulate the cost-benefit analysis of an adversary.” Likewise, a number of scholars have acknowledged the importance of incurring costs for deterrence by denial (e.g. Gross Stein and Levi 2015, 411; Nye 2017, 56; Mazarr 2018, 6; Libicki 2021, 192; Sawyer 2021, 111; Matania and Bachrach 2023; Zilincik and Sweijs 2023, 261). However, rather than seeing this finding as an obstacle, I argue it is an opportunity not only to clarify this strategy but also to develop a more extensive concept of deterrence in general as well as of deterrence by denial specifically.\nTo achieve this goal, I offer a new conceptualization of deterrence based on two elements: the means used by the deterrer actor to threaten (offensive or non-offensive) and the timing of the threatened use of these means (before or after the unwanted activity occurs). This theoretical move provides a way to clarify the concept of deterrence by denial and a better way to distinguish among different types of deterrence strategies, including by punishment and by denial, and thus avoids the binary distinction between them. Furthermore, this move offers a useful point of departure to advance the research of deterrence by denial success, which lags behind the research of deterrence by punishment success (Gross Stein and Levi 2015, 411; Wilner and Wenger 2021, 7; Zilincik and Sweijs 2023, 249). For example, if we Deterrence through Inflicting Costs acknowledge that deterrence by punishment and deterrence by denial overlap (i.e., they both concern inflicting costs), we can better rely on the existing scholarship of deterrence by punishment and draw important insights from it concerning both the success and the adoption of deterrence by denial. As a result, while it is beyond the scope of this paper to fully explore deterrence success, I do aim to demonstrate the advantages of the suggested conceptualization toward this goal.\nThe article unfolds as follows. In the first section, I identify a few issues on which the research of deterrence by denial could be further developed. In the second, I suggest the new conceptualization of deterrence, based on the distinction among four different categories, and illustrate them through kinetic and cyber deterrence practices. In the third section, I consider the advantages of this conceptualization regarding the main challenges of the study of deterrence by denial. I conclude by discussing further implications for deterrence scholarship.\n## The Concept of Deterrence by Denial and its Limitations I argue that the concept of deterrence by denial could be developed further in two interrelated ways: by elaborating on the conditions under which it succeeds and is adopted and by addressing its conceptual ambiguity.\n## The Need for Further Development of Theoretical Explanations for Deterrence by Denial ### Deterrence Success In contrast to the rich scholarship of deterrence by punishment, much less is known about the conditions under which the strategy of deterrence by denial works. Scholars agree that the conditions needed for deterrence by punishment are based on defenders' capabilities, credibility, and communication; however, no such clear articulation of the conditions for deterrence by denial exists. For example, we do not fully know whether the traditional conditions for success of deterrence by punishment are relevant to deterrence by denial or whether we need to consider other conditions, nor do we know how actors deliver their threats in deterrence by denial strategies. While researchers have recently started to engage more specifically with these types of questions, the scholarship still requires more comprehensive theoretical discussion and empirical studies of these conditions. What we currently have are specific assertions about particular factors that might affect deterrence success, for example, from scholars who study conventional deterrence and focus on deterrence by denial based on military capabilities (e.g., Mearsheimer 1983, 24-30, 62-6). However, as I will further discuss below, deterrence by denial does not rely exclusively on offensive capabilities or on military means in general.\n### Deterrence Adoption Theories of deterrence by denial could also be developed through studies elaborating on how and when actors adopt this strategy. Most deterrence scholars focus on deterrence success rather than on its adoption. As Lupovici (2021) points out, diverting the focus to the adoption of the strategy might be useful, especially when details about deterrence success are limited or difficult to attain. Scholars have already started to explore two main elements that affect the adoption of the strategy: technological changes and cultural and social elements.\n\nAMIR LUPOVICI However, these studies have mainly been in the context of deterrence by punishment. For example, some scholars have pointed to how technological changes eased the development and adoption of deterrence by punishment during the Cold War. In a similar way, scholars have shown how social elements such as culture, identity, and routines shape the adoption and implementation of practices of deterrence by punishment in different contexts. However, similar questions could be asked about deterrence by denial (e.g., Målksoo 2021): for example, whether deterrence by denial allows actors to maintain their prestige and status in the same manner as deterrence through punishment and retaliation.\n## Conceptual Ambiguity The challenge of conceptual ambiguity arises from the various kinds of means of employing the strategy of deterrence by denial and from the difficulty of clearly distinguishing between deterrence by denial and deterrence by punishment.\n## Multiple Strategies While scholars who explored deterrence by denial originally tended to regard it as based primarily on defensive measures (e.g., Buzan 1987, 135), recent studies agree that deterrence by denial can be achieved in various ways. As Borghard and Lonergan (2023, 541) argue, “While defense can be one mechanism that contributes to deterrence by denial, it is not the only—or even primary—means of achieving denial.” More recent scholarship has also pointed to different means to practice deterrence by denial, such as de-legitimization, resilience, and law enforcement activities; as well as long-term effects based on repeated failures at both strategic and tactical levels.\nAlthough it is important to acknowledge the different means through which actors can operate deterrence by denial, a more comprehensive framework would provide a systematic way to categorize the various types of deterrence and thus to effectively compare and contrast among strategies of deterrence by denial and deterrence by punishment. This would also be important given the need to elucidate the conditions under which this strategy works (or is adopted). In other words, it would help to show whether different conditions are necessary for success for different sub-categories of deterrence by denial.\n## Overlap of “Costs” As Wilner and Wenger (2021, 7) observe, scholars suggest that the effect of deterrence by punishment is achieved by fear of retaliation, and the deterrent effect of deterrence by denial is achieved by fear of failure (see also von Hlatky 2015, 4). While they aptly summarize the scholarship, I suggest that the distinction between deterrence by punishment and deterrence by denial is not as clear as many scholars assume.\nFirst, as Buzan (1987, 135), for example, has noted, “[I]n military terms, denial and defense have virtually identical meanings. Those who treat deterrence and defence as alternatives are assuming that deterrence is likewise synonymous with retaliation.” According to Buzan (1987, 136), since the purpose of deterrence is to prevent “unwanted actions before they occur... [L]ogically, therefore the concept of deterrence encompasses both denial and retaliation” (italics in original).\n\nHowever, the concern runs even deeper. The question is not whether punishment, denial, and defense should or could be seen as different methods of deterrence. Rather, what is in question is the attempt to fully distinguish between deterrence by punishment and deterrence by denial through the distinction between emphasizing costs for the putative challenger (deterrence by punishment) and emphasizing the challenger's ability to attain its goal (deterrence by denial).\nWhile fear—of failure and of inability to achieve a goal—is a constitutive element of deterrence by denial, it is only part of the deterrent mechanism. It can be suggested that “costs” also play an important role in the practices of deterrence by denial. While certain scholars do acknowledge this argument (e.g. Nye 2017, 56; Brantly 2018, 35; Mazarr 2018, 6; Sawyer 2021, 111; Matania and Bachrach 2023), some see it as being of limited importance. Gross Stein and Levi (2015, 411), for example, argue that the tactics of deterrence by denial “play principally on increasing the likelihood of failure, and only indirectly on cost.”\nThe point, however, is that effective deterrence may be attained by making it clear to the putative challengers that executing the undesired activity will be costly not because of retaliation but rather because of the costs involved in executing it. These are the potential costs the putative challenger would have to invest to acquire the means and carry out the unwanted action. When the costs associated with an activity the defender tries to prevent are low, it will be difficult to convince the putative challenger to avoid using or acquiring these means. In such cases, the challenger has little to lose even if the chances of success are also low. In contrast, increasing the putative challenger's costs could result in effective deterrence by denial. The deterrer actor does not have to make the undesired activity impossible to achieve but can influence the challenger's calculations by manipulating the costs of developing the undesired activity and executing it. Libicki (2021, 192), for example, asserts that a potential challenger needs to take into account > the relationship between the resources that must be invested to mount an attack and the resources that are expended to carry out an attack. If the latter are low, then having already decided to make the necessary investments, the decision to use them is likely to be influenced by the prospect of and losses from retaliation—but if the expected costs from retaliation are themselves low, the prospect of failure is likely to be of but modest importance because mounting the attack costs little.\nAlthough some scholars acknowledge this aspect of cost—which in fact challenges the clear distinction between deterrence by punishment and deterrence by denial—this insight has only marginally contributed to the (re)conceptualization of deterrence by denial: for example, in systematically considering the various costs the putative challenger may face in light of different strategies of deterrence. In other words, the distinguishing criteria of whether the deterrent threat aims to influence the challengers' perception of costs or of chances of success are not the most effective. For both strategies of deterrence—by punishment and by denial—the costs inflicted or manipulated by the defender have a significant influence on deterrence success.\n## Mapping Deterrence Strategies To address the challenges discussed in the previous section, I offer a new categorization of deterrence to better conceptualize its diverse types. This categorization is based on two interrelated elements: the means the deterrer uses to threaten the putative challenger and the timing of their use.\nFor the first element, I distinguish between two main types of deterrent means: means based on offensive military capability and non-offensive means. Offensive AMIR LUPOVICI means are all those weapons that are used or threatened to be used to cause physical harm to an opponent. Non-offensive means are all the other means. Non-offensive means could obviously be defensive measures, but they could also be various other means that limit the damage, limit the challenger's benefits from the damage, prevent the challenger from translating the successful challenge into a meaningful achievement, or (threaten) to cause non-material costs for the putative challenger, such as through de-legitimization, shaming, and stigmatization.\nThe second element is the potential timing of the employment of the deterrent measures. Obviously, any measure needs advance preparation, development, and acquirement, as well as communication of its existence to the putative challenger. Nonetheless, a key question is whether the threat is of a measure that will be employed before or after the undesired activity occurs. Some measures are employed mainly in advance, before the unwanted activity takes place, while others are employed after the unwanted activity takes place. While issuing the threatening message occurs before the unwanted activity, it could rely on means that, if needed, will be exercised only after an unwanted activity would occur, for example, retaliation. Thus, the deterrent effect—if successful—is achieved by an opponent's understanding that these means will follow the undesired activity. Conversely, for some other deterrent measures, the deterrent effect is achieved by the putative challenger's understanding that the deterrent means are already exercised, such as in the case of walls or norm building.\nBased on this, I distinguish among four types of strategies of deterrence (see table 1).\n## Deterrence through Offensive Means Used before the Execution of the Undesired Activity Actors use offensive means in a number of ways prior to the putative unwanted activity in order to deter it.\n## Denial Capabilities Actors may threaten to use offensive means prior to the execution of the undesired activity to establish their ability to deny the effect of the potential challenge and thus signal to the putative challenger that it is a worthless endeavor. The idea behind this strategy is not just to physically eliminate the capabilities of the opponent, as evident in defensive strategies, but also to signal to the challenger that allocating resources to this goal is too costly given that the goal may not be accomplished. As Sawyer (2021, 111) argues, 4My categorization is inspired by Wirtz (2021, 127–8), who acknowledges the various ways to attain deterrence thorough retaliation, punishment, and denial and distinguishes among three ways of using offensive means for deterrence by denial: “(1) threats to launch preemptive attack or preventive war to deny the opponent military capability to launch an attack; (2) threats to defeat an attack where and when it occurs…or (3) threats to eliminate the ‘bone of contention’,” thus temporary success will not lead to a political gain. However, there are a number of differences between his discussion and my framework. First, I more directly offer a systematic way to distinguish between the offensive means by putting forward the timing of their use. Second, I contrast these offensive strategies with non-offensive ones as part of the systematic categorization. Lastly, Wirtz limits his discussion to attempts to deter territorial changes.\n5My categorization is also inspired by Smith and Talbot (2008, 56–9), who distinguish among different levels of deterrence by denial: tactical, operational, and strategic. These, respectively, concern means used to prevent the act of terrorism, means that aim to prevent terrorist capabilities, and means of preventing the goals the terrorists pursue. As such, their study overlaps with the categorization suggested in this article, as timing plays a significant role in both. Nonetheless, Smith and Talbot’s categorizations also differ considerably from mine. First, Smith and Talbot focus specifically on deterring terrorism, while I use the categorization to explore various unwanted activities. Second, and more importantly, I focus on the timing of the employment of the means the deterrer actor uses, while their classification concerns the timing of the effect of the deterrence strategy. As a result, the offered categorization allows us to better compare deterrence by denial and deterrence by punishment and thus to better grasp these two types of strategies. The suggested categorization also overlaps with Zilincik and Sweijs (2023), who distinguish between different timings—before, during, and after an attack. Nonetheless, not only does their research focus on denial strategies and not on strategies of deterrence, but as a result, they also rely on different timing and consider different categories. Furthermore, their main goal is to examine the emotional effects of different denial strategies.\n\nTable 1. Categorization of deterrence strategies\n|  Timing of use of deterrent means | The means the deterrer actor uses  |   |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|   |  Offensive measures | Non-offensive measures  |\n|  Before the execution of the undesired activity | • Denial of opponent’s capabilities\n• “Defend Forward” | • Resilience\n• De-legitimization\n• Passive defensive measures (e.g., walls)\n• “Spoofing”  |\n|  After the execution of the undesired activity | • Retaliation\n• Denying military achievements | • Active defensive systems (e.g., anti-ballistic missiles)\n• Prevention of the benefit of the undesired activity  |\nCapability denial, when defined as restricting the adversary’s access to resources required for the targeted behavior, is largely indistinguishable from an offensive strategy aimed at eliminating the adversary’s capability. However, when it is defined as strategic communication intended to alter perceptions about the availability and acquisition costs for necessary resources ... it too is a case of dissuasion.\nThis strategy is evident in threats to make a preventive or preemptive strike in a way that denies the challenger’s military option . The idea is that these strikes will not just physically prevent the challenger’s ability to perform the unwanted action but will also signal that developing such an option is a useless effort.\nSome of Israel’s operations can be understood in this context. While Israel has traditionally emphasized the strategy of deterrence by punishment , its offensive capabilities are also used for deterrence by denial . One example is the destruction in 2007 of a nuclear reactor, secretly built in the Deir ez-Zor region in eastern Syria. While the attack was carried out through a covert airstrike to reduce the chances of an escalation, its details were officially revealed a few years later . Although some scholars, such as Bar (2020, 332), see Israel’s preventive and preemptive strikes as part of establishing deterrence by punishment (and cumulative deterrence), another message is being implicitly delivered: that is, allocating resources to the goals of developing nuclear capabilities will be worthless given Israel’s ability and will to eliminate them in advance . As a result, they not only deny the challenger’s ability to acquire nuclear capabilities that would challenge Israel, but they also demonstrate the involved costs for the putative challenger to invest in such an allegedly pointless endeavor. In a similar way, the operation that started in late 2018 to destroy the tunnels Hizbullah mined from Southern parts of Lebanon into Israeli territory to invade Israel was not just to eliminate Hizbullah’s capabilities: It also had a deterrent message referring to the heavy costs and resources Hizbullah put into this project, especially given the difficulties of digging in the rocky ground of the Galilee . While Israel made no prior attempts to deter Hizbullah from establishing these tunnels, the destruction aimed, among other things, to send a deterrent message in order to affect Hizbullah’s future behavior. Again, it should be emphasized that in these cases, the\nAMIR LUPOVICI\ndeterrent mechanism concerns not just the inability to succeed but also the costs associated with committing to the challenge and preparing for it.\n## Defend Forward\nThe cyber domain provides some interesting examples of this strategy based on the advance use of offensive means. For example, while there is some ambiguity regarding whether \"defend forward\" is a strategy of deterrence (by punishment) or a departure from it , some scholars have interpreted the US reliance on defend forward as a strategy that is based on denial through offensive means . As Borghard and Lonergan (2023) argue, \"Elements of the DoD's concept of defend forward resonate with a deterrence by denial strategy, specifically those aspects that are focused on counter-cyber operations to disrupt, deny, or degrade adversary offensive capabilities and infrastructure.\" The Department of Defense Cyber Strategy  clearly states, \"We will defend forward to disrupt or halt malicious cyber activity at its source, including activity that falls below the level of armed conflict.\" The deterrent message was described by General Paul Nakasone, Commander of US Cyber Command and Director of the National Security Agency, in the February 2019 Congressional testimony, in which he argued that these efforts could increase the costs of opponents' military actions through \"craft[ing] tools and tactics to frustrate their efforts\" (in Borghard and Lonergan 2023, 561). He echoes the idea that deterrence by denial aims to influence an opponent not just by affecting the putative challenger's estimations of success, but also by increasing the costs of conducting the undesired activity.\n## Deterrence through Threatening to Use Offensive Means after the Execution of the Undesired Activity\nDeterring threats may also refer—and often do—to threats that will be implemented if the unwanted activity were to occur. In contrast to the first category, which refers to deterrent means that are operated prior to the execution of the unwanted activity, in this category the timing of using the deterrent means is after the execution of the unwanted activity—that is if the unwanted activity has already occurred.\n## Deterrence by Retaliation\nThis strategy is evident most clearly in cases of deterrence by punishment, where the defender threatens to retaliate—that is the threat is to use offensive means after an unwanted activity occurred—in order to convince a putative challenger to avoid it. The fundamental idea of this strategy is that credibly threatening a putative challenger with a retaliation would lead the challenger to avoid the undesired behavior, at least if the cost of punishment would exceed any potential gain (e.g., George and Smoke 1974; Morgan 2003, 1–25). As noted above, this idea has been widely developed in the context of nuclear deterrence, but it has also shaped strategies based on different offensive means, including, in recent years, cyber deterrence (e.g., in Wilner 2020, 252–4). The idea is that if deterrence works, actors will avoid challenging a deterrer actor because of the costs the retaliation would pose. For this reason, and acknowledging the limited availability of cyber targets that would allow deterrers to impose high costs on putative challengers, actors are advised to retaliate against cyberattacks not only with cyber means but also with traditional military kinetic means (e.g., Kugler 2009, 328; Schneider 2019).\n## Denial of Achievements\nThreatening to use offensive means after the challenger has executed the unwanted activity could also characterize situations of deterrence by denial . Most prominently, this is the idea behind conventional military\n\ndifference. Indeed, as Luttwak (1985, 3) notes, traditionally “the continuous deterrence generated by military force was generally treated as a bonus gain,” and their main goal was winning the war. Nonetheless, acquiring military capabilities had the advantage of not only providing a remedy for cases of an attack (and thus deterrence failure), but also affecting the putative challenger’s calculations about their chances of success. For this reason, Mazarr (2018, 2) argues that a useful way to estimate the effectiveness of deterrence by denial is to examine the “immediate balance of forces in the contested territory.” This clearly emphasizes that the costs the putative challenger may need to pay concern not just situations of deterrence by punishment but also situations of deterrence by denial. Obviously, attacking an opponent capable of defending will increase the costs for a putative challenger, not just because of retaliation but also because of the costs of waging the war, even if the challenger could win it. As Mazarr (2018, 6) notes, “Even if an attacker believes it might be successful in such cases, the costs of a long and painful war are a powerful preventive deterrent.”\n## Deterrence through Non-Offensive Means Used before the Execution of the Undesired Activity Non-offensive means could also be used for deterrent purposes, both prior to and following the execution of the unwanted activity of a challenger. Those used prior to the unwanted activity include a variety of strategies to threaten an opponent, such as de-legitimization, establishing resilience, and passive defense means such as establishing walls. This non-offensive deterrent means by denial work through limiting the potential damage of the undesired activity either by preventing the damage or by preventing the challenger’s ability to translate the undesired activity into meaningful damage. Exercising these means becomes part of the deterrent message the defender issues to the putative challenger.\n## De-Legitimization A number of scholars have pointed to de-legitimization as an effective means of deterrence by denial, especially against terrorism. According to Stein Gross and Levi (2015, 417), “[T]he purpose is to manipulate the social rewards of prohibited action.” In their discussion, they rely on Wilner (2011, 26), who asserts, “[T]he objective is to reduce the challenger’s probability of achieving his goals by attacking the legitimacy of the beliefs that inform his behavior.” This strategy aims to influence the putative challenger’s perception of success—their ability to translate an attack into a political victory. Nonetheless, this strategy also relates to costs the putative challenger would pay in three meaningful ways. First, this means of deterrence through de-legitimization is partly based on the political costs the challenger will pay in their domestic arena (see also Wilner 2011, 27). Second, on the top of these costs are the direct costs associated with the means required to prepare and execute the undesired activity. Third, this strategy undermines the ability of the putative challenger to mobilize support, which also affects its available resources. In this respect, this creates costs, prevents gains, and denies its (future) capabilities.⁶ Nonetheless, the connections between de-legitimization and deterrence by denial success are complicated. On the one hand, there is some evidence that successful de-legitimization does not necessarily lead to effective deterrence. For example, Turkey successfully delegitimized the PKK (Kurdistan Workers’ Party) in the early 2000s, convincing many Western countries that it is a terror organization. However, while this successful de-legitimization had some effects on the PKK’s ability to mobilize resources and support (e.g., Casier 2010), it also “resulted in recurrence of ⁶According to Stein Gross and Levi (2015, 416–7) and based on criminological research, deterrence by denial through de-legitimization can be based on three different audiences that affect the potential risks and rewards of the terrorists: formal authorities (law enforcement), social bonds, and informal control.\nold practices, including its default to violence” (Gürcan and Coşar Ünal 2018, 194). Conversely, some scholars have provided evidence to demonstrate terror organization leaders' sensitivity to legitimacy. For example, Knopf considers a message sent by the number two leader of al Qaeda, at the time, Ayman al-Zawahari, to the leader of this organization in Iraq, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, in which Zawahari “instructed Zarqawi that his methods, including indiscriminate attacks on Muslim civilians and the release of videos showing hostage beheadings, were so excessive they had become counterproductive.” According to Zawahiri, ‘the strongest weapon which the mujahadeen enjoys.... is popular support from the Muslim masses... [meaning] the mujahed movement must avoid any action that the masses do not understand or approve'”.\nDe-legitimization is also used to deter threats other than terrorism, such as deterring cyberattacks through the development of norms, in this way increasing the costs the challenger would pay with regard to different audiences. As Soesanto and Smeets argue, “the creation of norms and rules for state behaviour in cyberspace, will over time translate into a general principle of restraint, raise the reputational costs of bad behaviour”.\nThis strategy is similarly used to deter attacks in outer space. According to Mckeown and Wilner (2020), one of the means to deter an attack on US satellites is through de-legitimization, which is based on “developing ‘norms of responsible behaviour' in outer space (so as to diplomatically isolate those who would break them)”. In fact, some official reports, such as from the US Department of Defense (2014), have pointed to the need to rely on this strategy, recommending the “development of international norms of responsible behavior that enhance safety, security, and stability in space.” According to the report, advancing these norms can have “a positive effect on deterrence; even if potential adversaries are not deterred from conducting hostile or malicious acts in space, norms can help the international community identify and isolate aggressors”.\nThis example thus captures both elements of deterrence by denial and of deterrence by punishment. On the one hand, it concerns the prevention of challengers' ability to translate a successful challenge into a meaningful political achievement. In situations where such norms are strong, domestic and international audiences will prevent the putative challenger from making it a political victory. On the other hand, it also concerns deterrence by punishment, especially since the putative challenger's fear is not just of material costs associated with the punishment, but also of psychological and social costs.\nThe logic of the nuclear taboo and the emergence of normative limits to the use of nuclear weapons increase the costs of using them and thus create self-deterrence mechanisms that also overlap with both deterrence by denial and deterrence by punishment. As Tannenwald argues, while taboos affect behavior in a number of ways, some of them rely on a deterrent effect achieved by increasing domestic and international public opinion costs. According to her, the norm of the taboo has not only had a significant and direct impact on the avoidance of using nuclear weapons over the years, but it has also enhanced nuclear deterrence, and thus increased the costs decision-makers would pay if they used nuclear weapons in a first strike. In this respect, policymakers' awareness of the norm, according to Tannenwald (2007), has dissuaded them from using these weapons.\n### Establishing Resilience The demonstration of resilience is another way actors can exercise deterrence by denial with non-offensive measures prior to the execution of the undesired activity.\nDefenders demonstrate and communicate to a potential challenger that they will not be able to translate the execution of the undesired activity, even if successful, into a meaningful political benefit. Resilience can be used in various contexts in multiple domains of competition and vis-à-vis different kinds of challenging actors: state and non-state. In addition, it can be employed with different means. For example, resilience can be achieved through technological solutions, such as backup and recovery systems in case of cyberattacks. Actors can also rely on developing procedures and routines to better prepare for absorbing undesired activities such as terror attacks, for example, by educating the public about such situations. Gearson (2012, 191) suggests that “[b]y demonstrating that a society is resilient and well prepared for dislocations and shock, with intelligent design and disaster recovery procedures embedded into government and private sector behaviour, the target communities will also be reassured and confident of recovery.” Furthermore, effective use of resilience mechanisms may create substantial costs for the putative challenger, implying that investing efforts in targeting the defender is not a wise decision for allocating resources. As Nye (2017, 56) suggests regarding these means, “Attackers have limited resources and time; therefore, driving up the costs can deter attacks.”\n### Defensive Means Strategies of deterrence by denial also rely on defensive means that could be used or employed before the execution of the undesired activity (e.g. Goldgeier and Wojtowicz. 2022, 5), including walls and fortifications. Cioffi-Revilla (1999), for example, uses archeological evidence from different regions to demonstrate that deterrence by denial was used thousands of years ago. According to him, massive walls “signal significant material capacity and likely organizational know-how to implement deterrence by denial”. These walls are also used in modern times with varying degrees of success, including against armies and terror attacks and even against migrants. The intention in these cases is to deter by signaling to individuals and armies that they will not be able to achieve their desired goals or that they will need to invest substantial resources toward it. Findings from migration scholarship show that while walls decrease the number of people who cross these specific areas, the numbers often increase in other areas. This echoes the point about the interrelated effects of the costs and chances of success in executing an action a deterrer actor attempts to prevent. Lastly, passive defense measures like “civil defense” are also based on non-military means that serve deterrence by denial, such as using shelters or evacuating populations in certain scenarios. These measures are used prior to the occurrence of the unwanted activity. While such measures can also be costly for the defender, they significantly limit the potential gain a putative challenger can make from executing the unwanted activity, and thus may decrease its attractiveness.\nSome cyber defensive measures may seem similar to traditional security means: for example, (fire-)walls, which are used to harden cyber targets and defend against cyberattacks and thus could have deterrent effect. Cyber technologies provide some other unique ways to use this type of strategy, for example, by remodeling the cyber terrain. This may enhance cyber defense and thus has deterrence by denial effects.\n### Spoofing Planting dummy targets makes the execution of the unwanted activity more costly and thus can be used as a strategy of deterrence by denial. The rationale is that planting dummy targets increases the potential future efforts and costs the putative challengers need to invest since resources have to be allocated to identify the real AMIR LUPOVICI Another example is the music industry’s attempt in the early 2000s to deter the sharing of media files through streaming services such as Napster. Various measures were used to complicate access to these files and thus to deter potential users. Spoofing was one of these methods, where copyright holders uploaded corrupted files, including fake music files, that provided computer users with “static, popping, cracking noises, or silence instead of the unauthorized music file they were attempting to download”. The industry even hired some companies to distribute these fake files. The explicit aim of these attempts was to create a deterrent effect: Given the time and costs of downloading files in the early 2000s, the attractiveness of this activity was lessened by actors’ knowledge that there was a good chance the file would be corrupted. In the end, the deterrent effect was aimed to be achieved by reducing the likelihood of success of downloading the media files. Nonetheless, the strategy also emphasizes the importance of “costs” for deterrence by denial. If there were no costs to downloading the music—internet costs, time invested in searching for the files, the annoyance of downloading a corrupted file—then there would be no deterrent effect. Interestingly, as Jennings and Bossler (2020, 1038–9) note, this strategy had little deterrent effect because the corrupted files were identified and so users could avoid them.\n## Deterrence through Threatening to Use Non-Offensive Means after the Execution of the Undesired Activity Lastly, actors could threaten to use non-offensive measures after absorbing the undesired activity. Most commonly, this could be done through threatening to use defensive measures to deny the effectiveness of the challenge, for example, thorough “anti-aircraft or anti-ballistic missile systems designed to bring down the enemy offensive before any targets were reached”. Clearly, the defender needs to have these capabilities as well as to communicate them to the putative challenger to dissuade the unwanted action (see also Golov 2016, 89).\nAn effective deterrence by denial carries the message that preparing and executing the challenge would be costly because the resources allocated would not be worth it. As Sawyer (2021, 111) notes, “Tactical denial—communication about target-hardening efforts—conveys the adversary that it must adopt new tactics, which are likely to increase the cost or uncertainty of action in the short term.” Denial could be established on defensive components in such a way that “an adver 7Scholars have pointed to a number of challenges concerning this strategy: for example, the limited credibility of reliance on defensive systems for deterrence, especially given the limited “margin of error”, their costs, the challenges they create for deterrence by punishment, and the incentives they may give to a putative challenger in order to exhaust the defensive systems budget. For a review of strategic negative implications of defensive systems on deterrence, see Quackenbush (2006, 533), who nonetheless contends that these systems eventually enhance deterrence success.\nsary cannot go on the offense without incurring significant costs”. This view is part of how Katagiri (2021), who focuses on deterrence through defensive means, defines deterrence by denial. According to him, it is the “ability to deny actions and persuade the opponent that it is unlikely to attain its immediate objectives at a reasonable cost”. This means that defensive measures may increase the costs for a putative challenger to execute the attack and thus, as in deterrence by punishment, may affect not only their chance of success but also their costs of planning, developing, and executing the challenge.\nTo take a more concrete example, Israel in recent years has shifted its strategy, relying increasingly on active defense systems to cover various types of threats, including the Iron Dome missile defense batteries that aim to intercept short-range rockets and the Arrow system that aims to intercept long-range missiles. Although skeptical about how effective these defensive measures are in creating successful deterrence, Adamsky (2021, 178--81) acknowledges that the changes in the strategic environment “produced a much stronger emphasis on defense in Israeli national security, and thus somewhat expanded the role of deterrence by denial in Israel strategic thought.”\nActive defense systems are also used for deterrence by denial strategies to dissuade cyberattacks. While the question remains as to whether these defensive systems could effectively provide defense or deterrence by denial, a number of scholars suggest this at least as a theoretical option. Schneider (2019, 113), for example, argues that “cyber defense” could be achieved through “securing nodes of civilian and military networks” such as space-based satellites and optic cables. The point, however, is that while cyber infrastructures could be defended with passive means, they could also be defended by active defense measures, including kinetic means such as ballistic missiles, as part of a cross-domain deterrence.\nHowever, non-offensive means do not necessarily need to be military ones. For example, policies of deterrence to prevent immigration rely on means used after the perceived unwanted activity occurs such as detaining immigrants, preventing social benefits and work rights, and reducing access to legal due process. All these means are characterized by being employed after the unwanted action has taken place—the immigrants have already entered a country whose government aims to deter immigration. The idea behind these deterrent policies is to demonstrate to potential immigrants that they will not be able to succeed: for example, they will be unable to work in the target country. This negates the value of the costs invested in the immigration process and in the efforts to immigrate into their territories.\n## Toward a Revised Theory of Deterrence by Denial The discussion so far demonstrates that while deterrence by punishment and deterrence by denial can be contrasted if we consider them through their strategic goals, overlaps can be seen by looking at the strategies' means as well as their timing. For example, both deterrence by denial and deterrence by punishment could be established by using offensive means, even those used after the execution of the challenge. The discussion also shows that inflicting costs is a significant element not only of deterrence by punishment but also of deterrence by denial. The strategy of deterrence by denial involves mechanisms that can increase the costs for the putative challenger, including costs associated with resources to prepare for and conduct the undesired activity. Some strategies of deterrence by denial concern other kinds of costs, such as costs the actor may pay in domestic and international arenas about its legitimization, which can affect its ability (and motivation) to execute the undesired activity. Taking these elements together, and acknowledging the overlap between deterrence by punishment and deterrence by denial, opens a path to further theorize deterrence by denial. Furthermore, acknowledging the overlap may lead a more general theory of deterrence to account for both types of deterrence.\nWhile it is beyond the scope of this article to cover all the factors accounting for the success of deterrence by denial, taking steps toward this goal could prove useful to demonstrate the advantages of the suggested conceptualization when it comes to explaining deterrence success and considering the adoption of the strategy.\n### Deterrence Success—The Balance of Costs As demonstrated above, different means of both deterrence by punishment and deterrence by denial may incur costs in various ways for putative challengers. It follows then that a key concept in accounting for deterrence success (of deterrence by either punishment or denial) is the balance of costs. When the costs to the putative challenger of executing the challenge are low—because the cost of expected retaliation is low, because the costs of the means for the attack are low, because the costs of executing the attack are low, and/or because the domestic audience supports paying these costs—the challenge will be much more difficult to successfully deter. Similarly, when acquiring or using the means of deterrence is costly for the defender, it is difficult to threaten using them as deterrents (see also Matania and Bachrach 2023).\nThis was exactly the situation with Israel's reliance on defensive measures to deter Hamas rockets launched from Gaza using the Iron Dome system. The costs for Hamas were between 500 and 1,000 US dollars per Katyusha rocket, while each intercepting missile costs 50,000 and a battery of Iron Dome costs around 100 million US dollars. Although the costs for Israel in a situation without any defensive measures might be much higher given the potential damage these rockets can do, this system's deterrent effect in preventing these attacks is very limited. In fact, some have pointed out that these unbalanced costs may incentivize Hamas to challenge Israel to erode its security budget. This is why former Israeli Prime Minister, Naftali Bennet (2022), declared that Israel is developing a defense system based on laser technology: To change “[t]he economic equation... If it is possible to intercept a missile or rocket with just an electric pulse that costs a few dollars, we will have nullified the ring of fire that Iran has set up on our borders. The whole thing no longer pays off.”\nIn contrast, in other cases, the deterrer actors may be the ones who enjoy the “balance of costs.” An interesting example is provided by Lior Div, the CEO of Cybereason, a cyber security company. Although he does not refer to the concept of deterrence by denial, he clearly demonstrates this logic when discussing the SolarWinds attack. This was a serious cyberattack, likely sponsored by a foreign government, that infected numerous computers in the United States in late 2020, including nine government agencies and a hundred private companies. In an interview, Div noted that “SolarWinds attackers scanned networks to determine if Cybereason's software was installed. If they saw that it was present, they bypassed it and moved along to another network”. Given the system's past successes, the hackers did not want it to gather information on their malicious code. This is an example of deterrence by denial based on the challenger's fear that the system could effectively detect and neutralize the attack and thus render the efforts invested in the malicious code useless. More generally, while not entirely deterring the use of this attack and not using fear of retaliation, the Cybereason system effectively deterred by denial the attack on the computers on which it operated.\nAnother important factor affecting the balance of costs, and thus deterrence success, is the cost for the putative challenger of identifying relevant targets and knowing how costly it would be to execute the challenge: for example, in case of defensive missiles, how costly it would be for a putative challenger to identify areas the system cannot fully cover, or, similarly, in the case of building walls, how costly (how many resources it would take) it would be for immigrants to identify alternative routes to those blocked by walls. It could be that these latter costs are not high, as evidence shows that while walls have a deterrent effect, the number of those crossing in areas without walls increases. Another example is in the case of spoofing. As noted above, the costs of identifying the fake media files were very low, which led to deterrence failure. Nonetheless, planting dummy targets at sea seems a much more effective strategy given that many actors do not have access to measures that allow them to identify the real targets, thus significantly increasing their costs to distinguish between real and faked ones (Gutman and Rojkes Dombe 2017).\nThe cost of knowing is also affected by another factor; that is, the costs to execute the activity the defender aims to prevent. When the costs to execute the unwanted activity are very low, the costs of knowing become less important, since a putative challenger may easily challenge many possible targets. For example, as noted above, when the cost for launching rockets is low, as in the case of the rockets Hamas launches against Israel, putative challengers do not need to invest many resources into identifying alternative targets, thus indicating the limited effectiveness of deterrence by denial.\nThe costs of knowing are also relevant for deterrence by punishment. In some cases, deterrer actors, indeed, clearly state what the costs would be for executing the unwanted behavior and what would be considered as such a behavior. Nonetheless, in many other cases, the deterrent threat includes ambiguities (see Crawford 2003, 11--2) that force the putative challenger to invest resources in identifying the structure of costs. In terms of the balance of costs, this adds another layer and trade-off of costs affecting deterrence success.\nLastly, the balance of costs may also be affected by different mechanisms and means operated at different times. This is because a deterrent means may incur additional costs at times other than when they are exercised. Acknowledging the different categories presented above, which refer to different timings at which the deterrent means are exercised, may thus point to other ways to enhance the deterrent threat. For example, as discussed above, building norms is a non-offensive deterrent means used prior to the execution of the unwanted activity. Its effectiveness stems from policymakers' sensitivity to the domestic and international public opinion costs, and thus on their ability to translate the unwanted activity into a meaningful political achievement. However, while normative structures create a pre-condition for deterrence success, the deterrent effect may be enhanced by other mechanisms that could be exercised if an unwanted activity takes place, such as naming and shaming. Breaking norms inflict “a kind of social punishment on the normative transgressor. A loss of face amongst the international community is the likely outcome of such a naming and shaming exercise”. In other words, naming and shaming practices allow an actor to translate the norm into a specific deterrent threat, and thus to incur more concrete costs. Conversely, decision-makers who know that no one would translate the inappropriate behavior into costs would be less affected by the norm.\nFurthermore, these dynamics could also have future deterrent effects, even if they failed. In this respect, although exercising naming and shaming demonstrates deterrence failure, as neither the norm nor the possibility of naming and shaming dissuaded the unwanted activity, it may clarify the potential costs for future similar behavior. In addition, practicing naming and shaming may help mobilize opponents to this behavior, resulting in a future increase in the costs of the unwanted activity.\nAMIR LUPOVICI\n\n## Adoption of Deterrence Strategy\nIn addition, the overlap between deterrence by punishment and deterrence by denial could be used to elaborate on elements that affect the adoption of the strategy. The discussion above emphasizes not only the strategies the deterrer actor uses but also the means and timing. This provides a useful point of departure for asking questions about the reliance on deterrence strategies in general or about the exact type of deterrence, as well as about the specific means used for deterrence purposes. For example, cultural elements may explain actors’ reliance on non-offensive measures for deterrence. The case of Japan, given its culture and constitutional restrictions, is a key example of an actor that relies on deterrence by denial through defensive systems . As Katagiri (2021, 207) explains, in addition to extended deterrence it receives, Japan’s doctrine is based on “defensive defence, which bans offensive use of force even in wartime. It means that defensive force can only be used in the event of a foreign attack and is limited to the minimum necessary for self-defence. Since the 1970s it has informed Japan’s deterrence-by-denial posture and affected weapons programs and operations.”\nIn a similar way, cultural and social elements may explain a state’s reliance on strategies of deterrence by punishment or deterrence by denial that mainly use offensive measures. For Israel, for example, reliance on the actual use of force as part of practicing deterrence, and especially cumulative deterrence, is a formative idea . It is related not only to strategic elements, but also to cultural, social, and political ones . From this perspective, it matters little whether the strategy relies on deterrence by punishment or deterrence by denial. Rather, the important elements are the means used and the ability to employ them as part of a strategy of deterrence.\n## Conclusion\nIn this article, I offered a new way to distinguish among different types of deterrence strategies based on the means used for deterrent threats and the timing of when actors threaten to use them. I demonstrated each of the various types by considering examples from kinetic and cyber domains. I argue that using this categorization better captures the differences and overlapping of deterrence by punishment and deterrence by denial. In addition, viewing deterrence through these lenses also emphasizes that inflicting costs is a key aspect not only of deterrence by punishment but also of deterrence by denial.\nExploring these issues helps us to further theorize about deterrence by denial, whose study currently lags behind the research on deterrence by punishment. While this paper acknowledges this gap, it also offers and demonstrates a direction to close it by contextualizing the means deterrer actors use and recognizing that costs are an aspect common to both types of deterrence.\nI conclude by pointing to a broader research agenda derived from this research. First, this discussion helps us to reconsider how factors already acknowledged in deterrence scholarship may have different effects on the categories presented above. For example, scholars acknowledge the importance of communicating capabilities and intentions. Means used before defenders experience the challenge—either defensively or offensively—may communicate the threat more effectively than those employed only post-factum, as, for example, in the case of traditional deterrence\n\nby punishment. Furthermore, thinking through this lens may inspire research on other factors affecting deterrence success. Second, and along with the previous point, this research allows us to consider, categorize, and explain different strategies of deterrence. For example, in recent years scholars have pointed to the strategy of threatening to reveal the identity of a putative challenger through the notion of deterrence by detection or by accusation (e.g., Lindsay and Gartzke 2018, 192; Finnemore and Hollis 2020, 980–1; Wilner 2020, 271). The framework suggested here would locate this strategy as a non-offensive means operated after the execution of the undesired action: for example, technological means will help to identify post-factum who committed the attack, but communicating this capability in advance could have a deterrent effect. Considering this strategy in this category allows us to develop specific factors to account for its failure or success and help us to better contrast it with other strategies of deterrence.\nAlso important in further developing explanations of deterrence success, as discussed above, is to focus on costs or the balance of costs. Again, one set of questions concerns how costs—and not just costs of a retaliatory strike—could be communicated, including communicating both the ability to inflict costs and the intention to use these capabilities. Furthermore, distinguishing among different types of costs inflicted at different points of time is also a promising direction for theorizing deterrence success, including that of deterrence by denial.\nThis categorization inspires additional questions about the adoption of the strategy. For example, scholars could explore whether actors prioritize some means for deterrent purposes over others, such as in the Japanese and Israeli cases briefly discussed above. Scholars could also ask more specific questions about key concepts, such as the cult of reputation. For example, they could compare the effects of this cult on actors’ reliance on offensive and non-offensive means when they consider adopting or issuing a deterrent threat.\nFinally, on an empirical level, this framework offers a useful direction to explore cyber deterrence further. As noted above, while deterrence by denial seems a more effective strategy to address cyber security concerns, such research requires further theoretical development (e.g., Borghard and Lonergan 2023, 534-5). My research addresses this challenge by offering specific directions to explore cyber deterrence success (and its adoption). For example, the emphasis of this conceptual framework on “costs” is pertinent to exploring cyber security given the various costs involved for both the defender and the putative challenger. Likewise, cyber technologies could spark interesting debates on the distinction between offensive and non-offensive means both in thinking about deterrence success and in studying the adoption of the strategy. This is especially important given questions about what counts as offensive or violent means in the cyber domain, and thus what legitimizes a response and with what means."
