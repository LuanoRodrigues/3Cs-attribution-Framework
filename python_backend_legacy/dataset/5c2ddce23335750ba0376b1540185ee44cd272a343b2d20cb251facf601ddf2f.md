This article examines that open question. It argues that, whilst the international community has taken some incremental steps towards updating and extending the prohibition to non-violent cyber attacks, those steps have not yet been clear or widespread enough to change that original exclusion from scope.\n## INTRODUCTION\nWhen the *Charter of the United Nations*¹ came into force in 1945, the cyber world was not just yet to be militarised — it did not exist. It should therefore be of no surprise that the *UN Charter* does not include express regulation of cyber tools in military contexts. Yet, today, the advent of modern technology enables States to inflict major damage on one another without exhibiting the traditional hallmarks of conflict. The purpose of this article is therefore to examine whether the use of non-violent cyber attacks is included in the general prohibition on the ‘use of force’ by States in article 2(4) of the *UN Charter*.\nPart II of this article examines the original intent of article 2(4) and determines that cyber attacks were not within its original scope. Part III then contends that article 2(4) is a ‘living instrument’ capable of being given a modern interpretation beyond that of its 1940s origin. Part IV finds it unclear whether customary international law currently prohibits non-violent cyber attacks, which suggests that article 2(4) cannot be given an expansive interpretation to include non-violent cyber attacks. Finally, Part V determines that non-violent cyber attacks are not sufficiently similar to economic blockades, and therefore the same principles of customary international law cannot be extended to non-violent cyber attacks by analogy.\nFor the purposes of this article, ‘non-violent cyber attacks’ shall be taken to be States’ use of cyber-based tools to disrupt or corrupt other States’ computer networks in order to cause non-physical damage, such as widespread social or economic disruption. The reason this article will not focus on cyber attacks that\n---\n* BA/LLB (UNSW) Assistant Director, Australian Government.

The mere fact that a military action can easily be concealed is of no relevance to whether it is theoretically a use of force — for example, a State’s use of unmarked planes in a clandestine bombing raid is unambiguously still a use of force, despite its hidden nature. Indeed, the legality of an action under article 2(4) can even be determined in the hypothetical,⁵ where there is no attribution (difficult or otherwise) to be had.\n## II THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF ARTICLE 2(4)\nTo answer the question as to whether non-violent cyber attacks can be a ‘use of force’ for the purposes of article 2(4), it must first be determined what the drafters of the UN Charter originally intended by the phrase. To begin with, the full text of article 2(4) in the UN Charter is as follows:\nAll Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.⁶\nUnder the customary rule of treaty interpretation enshrined in article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, the terms of the UN Charter are generally to be interpreted in accordance with their ordinary meaning in light of their context, object, and purpose.⁷ A contextual interpretation suggests that the prohibition of\n2 This example being drawn from Major Graham H Todd, ‘Armed attack in cyberspace: deterring asymmetric warfare with an asymmetric definition’ [2009] (Winter) 64 Air Force Law Review 65, 96.\n3 For examples of academic support for such an effects-based approach to cyber attacks, see: United States Department of Defense, *An Assessment of International Legal Issues in Information Operations* (May 1999) (‘US Defense Report 1999’), 18; Major Arie J Schaap ‘Cyber warfare operations: development and use under international law’ (2009) (Winter) 64 Air Force Law Review 121, 147–148, 172, citing Michael N Schmitt, ‘Wired Warfare: Computer Network Attack and Jus in Bello’ (2002) 84 International Review of the Red Cross 365.

Whilst article 4 of the 1969 Vienna Convention provides that the 1969 Vienna Convention itself does not apply to the UN Charter (due to the UN Charter pre-dating the 1969 Vienna Convention), the article recognises that the customary international law\nNON-VIOLENT CYBER ATTACKS: A CONTRAVENTION OF ARTICLE 2(4)?\n93\nforce in article 2(4) is restricted to the traditional, kinetic types akin to those available in the WWII era. For instance, the Preamble to the UN Charter states that ‘armed force shall not be used, save in the common interest’⁸ — the term ‘armed’ implying a physical military dimension.⁹ Given that preambulatory statements are often conceptually more general than the articles that effectuate them, the inclusion of cyber attacks in article 2(4) would lead to an internal textual inconsistency in which a preambulatory term is narrower than its operative article. On the presumption that the drafters of the UN Charter did not intend to create such textual inconsistency, this suggests article 2(4) was not meant to include cyber attacks.¹⁰\nFurthermore, article 44 in the UN Charter also implies that ‘use of force’ is simply shorthand for ‘armed force’. Article 44 provides that the United Nations Security Council shall invite certain member States to contribute ‘armed forces … under Article 43’ when the Security Council has resolved to ‘use force’.¹¹ If the phrase ‘use force’ is to include non-armed force like cyber attacks, then a logical inconsistency would arise in which the Security Council can resolve to use non-armed force but is empowered to ask member States to contribute armed force only. Again, on the reasonable presumption that the drafters did not intend such inconsistency, one must conclude that ‘use of force’ (with its close similarity to ‘use force’) refers only to armed force.¹²\nThis confinement to armed force is reinforced when one has reference to the preparatory works of the UN Charter, in accordance with the customary rule enshrined in article 32 of the 1969 Vienna Convention. At the San Francisco Conference in which the UN Charter was drafted, the delegation from Brazil proposed the express insertion of economic measures into article 2(4). This proposal was rejected by twenty-six votes to two, indicating that the drafters consciously did not want to include economic coercion within the scope of ‘use of force’.¹³ Given that economic coercion was essentially the only non-armed means of inter-State antagonism in the 1940s, this reinforces that article 2(4) was originally intended to prohibit armed force only.\nIndeed, at various times during the early stages of the Cold War, member States of the United Nations raised the notion of article 2(4) applying beyond armed force,\nenshrined in the 1969 Vienna Convention can so apply (‘Without prejudice to the application of any rules set forth in the present Convention to which treaties would be subject under international law independently of the Convention …’).\n⁸ UN Charter Preamble (‘… to ensure, by the acceptance of principles and the institution of methods, that armed force shall not be used, save in the common interest…’) (emphasis added).\n⁹ Waxman (n 4) 428; Michael N Schmitt, ‘Computer Network Attack and the Use of Force in International Law: Thoughts on a Normative Framework’ (1999) 37 Columbia Journal of Transnational Law 885, 904.\n¹⁰ Schmitt (n 9) 904.\n¹¹ UN Charter art 44 (‘When the Security Council has decided to use force it shall, before calling upon a Member not represented on it to provide armed forces in fulfilment of the obligations assumed under Article 43, invite that Member, if the Member so desires, to participate in the decisions of the Security Council concerning the employment of contingents of that Member’s armed forces.’).\n¹² Schmitt (n 9) 904.\n¹³ Ibid 905; Michael Gervais, ‘Cyber Attacks and the Laws of War’ [2012] (Winter) 1 Journal of Law &lt;= Cyber Warfare 7, 26. For an interpretation to the contrary, see Ido Kilovaty, ‘Rethinking the Prohibition on the Use of Force in the Light of Economic Cyber Warfare: Towards a Broader Scope of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter’ (2015) 4(3) Journal of Law &lt;= Cyber Warfare 210, 230–231.\nAUSTRALIAN INTERNATIONAL LAW JOURNAL\nbut this expansion did not gain sufficient support in academia¹⁴ nor was it reflected in representative State practice.¹⁵ In 1970, international lawyer Thomas Franck even went so far as to declare that article 2(4) had been ‘killed’ due to its non-application (at the time) to the arming of insurgencies in proxy wars,¹⁶ which is an action more akin to traditional armed force than cyber attacks.\nFinally, for completeness, little guidance can be gleaned from the ‘against the territorial integrity or political independence’ qualifier to ‘use of force’ that is found in article 2(4). This is because the preparatory works of the UN Charter make it sufficiently clear that the qualifier is not meant to restrict the meaning of article 2(4).¹⁷ Moreover, the open-endedness of ‘or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations’ extends the scope of article 2(4) to virtually any ‘use of force’ that is not expressly authorised elsewhere in the UN Charter.¹⁸ It is thus clear that article 2(4) was considered — at least originally — to be limited to physical examples of force (indeed, only certain such examples), thus excluding cyber attacks.\n## III IS THE UN CHARTER A ‘LIVING INSTRUMENT’?\nDespite this clarity of original intent, article 2(4) has subsequently been treated as a ‘living instrument’ by two organs of the United Nations itself: the International Court of Justice and the United Nations General Assembly. Whilst neither of these organs has authority to amend the words of the UN Charter,¹⁹ their status within the United Nations accords them particularly authoritative weight in interpreting the UN Charter.²⁰\n14 Quincy Wright, ‘Subversive Intervention’ (1960) 54(3) The American Journal of International Law 521, 529 (‘It is clear that [its provisions] prohibit only the threat or use of armed force or an armed attack. They cannot be construed to include other hostile acts such as propaganda, infiltration or subversion.’), quoted in Waxman (n 4) 430.\n15 Waxman (n 4) 428–430, 449.\n16 Thomas M Franck, ‘Who Killed Article 2(4)?

Of course, this does not answer what constitutes a ‘use of force’ in the first place.\n19 Amending the UN Charter effectively requires a two-thirds vote of the United Nations General Assembly, followed by ratification by two-thirds of Members (including the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council): UN Charter art 108 and 109.\n20 Under article 7 of the UN Charter, both the International Court of Justice and the General Assembly are ‘principal organs’ of the United Nations. The General Assembly comprises all members of the United Nations (article 9(1) of the UN Charter) and, in accordance with the customary rules of treaty interpretation enshrined in article 31(3)(a) and (b) of the 1969 Vienna Convention, practices or agreement amongst the United Nations members regarding the application of the UN Charter — such as United Nations General Assembly resolutions — can be relevant to the interpretation of the UN Charter. As for the authoritative weight of the International Court of Justice, the UN Charter states the Court to be the ‘principal judicial organ’ of the United Nations and every member to be a party to the Statute of the Court: articles 92 and 93(1) of the UN Charter. The US Department of Defense makes a similar point about the influence of the International Court of Justice and the United Nations General Assembly on customary international law: US Defense Report 1999 (n 3) 1 (‘…certain actions of some international institutions, such as the International Court of Justice and the UN General Assembly, are considered to be persuasive evidence of the existence of principles of customary international law’).\nNON-VIOLENT CYBER ATTACKS: A CONTRAVENTION OF ARTICLE 2(4)?\n95\nIn 1971, the International Court of Justice held that the UN Charter, as an international instrument, can — indeed, must — be:\ninterpreted and applied within the framework of the entire legal system prevailing at the time of the interpretation.²¹\nTherefore, by logical inference, the interpretation of the UN Charter must continuously change as the entire international legal system continuously changes around it.\nMore recently, the United Nations General Assembly has passed multiple Resolutions by considerable majority votes²² with the following preambulatory statement:\n… Confirming the conclusions of the Group of Governmental Experts, in its 2013 and 2015 reports, that international law, and in particular the Charter of the United Nations, is applicable and essential to maintaining peace and stability and promoting an open, secure, stable, accessible and peaceful information and communications technology environment …²³\nTherefore, one can see that the expansive ‘living instrument’ approach towards article 2(4), whilst by no means unanimous, has grounding in international legal discourse — including in the cyber context.²⁴ As a consequence, it may in fact be possible for the general prohibition contained in article 2(4) of the UN Charter to be interpreted to include cyber attacks.\n²¹ Legal Consequences for States of the Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia (South West Africa) notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276 (1970) (Advisory Opinion) [1971] ICJ Rep 16, 31 [53] (emphasis added). Similarly, the International Court of Justice has expansively applied article 31(3)(c) of the 1969 Vienna Convention, which enshines the customary rule of treaty interpretation that ‘any relevant rules of international law applicable in relations between the parties [to the treaty being interpreted]’ are to be taken into account: Oil Platforms (Islamic Republic of Iran v.

This is relevant because, according to the International Court of Justice's above quotation from Namibia (Advisory Opinion), the entire legal system — including customary international law — affects the contemporary interpretation of the term 'use of force' in article 2(4). Accordingly, if the equivalent principles regarding uses of force extend to non-violent cyber attacks under customary international law, then there is good reason to argue that article 2(4) must be given the same expansive interpretation.\nCustomary international law is difficult to delineate precisely, but it can be sourced from international legal discourse. Of particular relevance for this article are three such evidentiary sources: United Nations General Assembly Resolutions, treaty law, and other forms of State practice that signify a legal duty is believed to exist.²⁵\n## A. General Assembly Resolutions\nIn 1974, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Resolution on the Definition of Aggression,²⁶ to which was annexed the 'Definition of Aggression'. As recognised by the International Court of Justice in its 1986 judgment of Nicaragua v United States of America (Merits), the Resolution on the Definition of Aggression represents a significant source of customary international law concerning the use of force.²⁷ The Resolution on the Definition of Aggression was also adopted by consensus,²⁸ which enhances its potential influence on customary international law.²⁹\nWith a preambulatory statement that 'aggression' is the 'most serious and dangerous form of the illegal use of force' (a clear reflection of article 2(4) of the UN Charter), one of the non-exhaustive examples of aggression given in the Definition of Aggression annex to the Resolution on the Definition of Aggression is found in article 3(b) of the annex:\n²⁵ All three sources' relevance to customary international law is cited in Military and Paramilitary Activities In and Against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States of America) (Merits) [1986] ICJ Rep 1986 ('Nicaragua (Merits)'), 99–100 [188]. For a non-exhaustive, but detailed, list of sources of customary international law, see Michael Wood, Special Rapporteur, Second report on identification of customary international law, International Law Commission, 66th Session, UN Doc A/CN.4/672 (1 October 2014) 22–33 [41]–[46].\n²⁶ Resolution on the Definition of Aggression, GA Res 3314, UN GAOR, 34th sess, 2319th plen mtg, UN Doc A/Res/3314 (14 December 1974) ('Resolution on the Definition of Aggression').\n²⁷ Nicaragua (Merits) (n 25) 103–104 [195].\n²⁸ Wing Commander Duncan Blake and Lieutenant Colonel Joseph S Imburgia, “‘Bloodless weapons’?

In particular, the ICRC commentary states that ‘weapon’ is to be construed ‘in the widest sense’ with respect to the way in which it is used, and does not necessarily need to be lethal.³⁴ Thus, by linking the definition of ‘weapon’ contained in article 36 of the 1977 Additional Protocol I to the same word used in the Resolution on the Definition of Aggression, one could conclude that cyber attacks can be a ‘weapon’ of aggression and, therefore, capable of being an illegal use of force under customary international law.³⁵\nHowever, two important caveats must be made to this ‘weapon’ connection. First, the 1977 Additional Protocol I is a treaty concerning jus in bello (legality of conduct during conflict), whereas the Resolution on the Definition of Aggression and article 2(4) of the UN Charter concern jus ad bellum (legality of conflict commencement). As a result, the customary legal principles embodied in each are likely to be different from one another, thereby limiting their mutual applicability.\nSecondly, the existence of the same phrase in two different instruments of law does not necessarily mean that the same meaning is intended across both contexts. As a result, the term ‘weapon’ in the 1977 Additional Protocol I could well be denoting\n30 Resolution on the Definition of Aggression (n 26) annex Preamble (‘... Considering also that, since aggression is the most serious and dangerous form of the illegal use of force ...’ (emphasis original)), art 3(b) (emphasis added).\n31 Todd makes a similar argument in relation to ‘armed attack’ under article 51 of the UN Charter.

Treaty law\nThe second possible source of the illegality of cyber attacks comes from treaty law, which can both influence and codify principles of customary international law.³⁷ One treaty that is of incidental relevance to cyber warfare is the Constitution and Convention of the International Telecommunication Union.³⁸ Most relevantly, article 45 of the ITU Convention prohibits ‘harmful interference’ of radio services and communications of other members of the International Telecommunication Union. ‘Harmful interference’ is defined in the annex to the ITU Convention as:\nInterference which endangers the functioning of a radionavigation service or of other safety services or seriously degrades, obstructs or repeatedly interrupts a radio communication service . . .³⁹\nDespite containing no reference to ‘use of force’, article 45 of the ITU Convention is relevant in that it prohibits the blocking of telecommunication devices — a common effect of cyber attacks. Moreover, it is a treaty considered to apply primarily during peacetime,⁴⁰ which is when the jus ad bellum parameters of article 2(4) of the UN Charter are relevant. As such, with its near-unanimous adoption,⁴¹ the ITU Convention represents at least a minor indication that non-violent cyber attacks are capable of contravening customary international law regarding the use of force, and thus potentially article 2(4) of the UN Charter as well.\nConversely, the Convention Respecting the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers and Persons in Case of War on Land 1907⁴² is a treaty that could be shaping customary international law against a prohibition of non-violent cyber attacks. Under article 8 of the 1907 Neutrality Convention, a State’s neutrality is not violated by belligerents’ use of the State’s ‘telegraphy or telephone cables or … wireless telegraphy apparatus’.⁴³ By contrast, the Resolution on the Definition of Aggression includes a State ‘allowing its territory… to be used by [another] State for perpetrating an act of\n³⁶ Ibid 189.\n³⁷ Nicaragua (Merits) (n 25) 94–95 (177).\n³⁸ Constitution and Convention of the International Telecommunication Union, concluded 22 December 1992, 1825, 1826 UNTS (entered into force 1 July 1994) (‘ITU Constitution’ and ‘ITU Convention’).

Thus, this suggests that cyber attacks are not a use of force under customary international law.45\nHaving said this, though, it is worth noting that the 1907 Neutrality Convention is of considerable age and thus is less likely to reflect today's customary international law, especially in the fast-changing realm of technology. In addition, there is nothing in the 1907 Neutrality Convention to suggest that it applies to the many types of modern technological systems that generate electronic information (such as satellite imagery and navigation systems), rather than just to those that simply relay communications ('telegraphy').46 Thus, the indication in the 1907 Neutrality Convention that cyber attacks are not a use of force should be considered relevant to the slightest degree only.\nAccordingly, treaty law does not provide strong or consistent guidance either.\n## C. Other State practice\nThe third evidentiary source of customary international law that could signify the status of cyber attacks is the individual conduct of the States themselves (as opposed to the collective acts of passing General Assembly resolutions and entering treaties). This is a well-recognised notion in which the conduct — both proactive and passive — and statements of member States can, if widespread and consistent enough, develop and reflect customary international law.47\nGiven that customary international law is most readily interpreted from the actions of States whose interests are specially affected,48 three member States whose approaches to cyber attacks are likely particularly relevant are the People's Republic of China (as the State with the most Internet users),49 the United States of America (as the most populous State with over 90% of the population using the Internet),50\n44 Resolution on the Definition of Aggression (n 26) annex art 3(f) ('Any of the following acts, regardless of a declaration of war, shall, subject to and in accordance with the provisions of article 2, qualify as an act of aggression... The action of a State in allowing its territory, which it has placed at the disposal of another State, to be used by that other State for perpetrating an act of aggression against a third State').\n45 A similar conclusion is reached in Blake and Imburgia (n 28) 186–187 about the 1907 Neutrality Convention without reference to the Resolution on the Definition of Aggression.\n46 US Defense Report 1999 (n 3) 10.\n47 North Sea Continental Shelf (Federal Republic of Germany v Denmark; Federal Republic of Germany v Netherlands) (Judgment) [1969] ICJ Rep 3 ('North Sea Continental Shelf'), 28–29 [37], 44 [77]; Nicaragua (Merits) (n 25) 98–100 [186]–[188]; Continental Shelf (Libyan Arab Jarnabiriya/Malta) (Judgment) [1985] ICJ Rep 13, 29–30 [27]; Wood (n 25) 22–31 [41]–[44].\n48 North Sea Continental Shelf (n 47) 41–42 [73]–[74], partially cited in Scott J Shackelford, 'From nuclear war to net war: analogizing cyber attacks in international law' (2009) 27(1) Berkeley Journal of International Law 192, 218 and in ILC Draft Conclusions (n 23), 136–137.\n49 For a comparison of the total number of Internet users in different States in 2020, see Central Intelligence Agency, Field Listing — Internet Users (2022) <https: internet-users=\"\" file=\"\" file.=\"\" file.indd=\"\" www.cia.gov=\"\"></https:>.

The Estonian Government even raised the prospect of invoking the collective self-defence mechanism of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (‘NATO’) in response to the cyber attacks.⁶¹ It is therefore clear from the Estonian Government’s actions that it, too, considers cyber attacks to be capable of constituting a use of force.\nIndeed, NATO — of which the USA and the Republic of Estonia are members⁶² — has itself made postures indicating that, as a collective regional organisation, it views cyber attacks as potentially constituting a use of force under article 2(4) of the UN Charter. In 2014, in its Wales Summit Declaration, NATO declared that:\n… international law, including international humanitarian law and the UN Charter, applies in cyberspace …. A decision as to when a cyber attack would lead to the invocation of Article 5 [of the North Atlantic Treaty] would be taken by the North Atlantic Council on a case-by-case basis.⁶³\nWhat is particularly pertinent here is that article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, which the Republic of Estonia sought to invoke in 2007, mirrors and expressly cites article 51 of the UN Charter.⁶⁴ Article 51 of the UN Charter is enlivened if one State commits an ‘armed attack’ against another State, and ‘armed attack’ is widely interpreted to mean more egregious uses of force than those contemplated in article 2(4) of the UN Charter.⁶⁵ In other words, by definition, any action that is an armed attack in article 51 must also be a use of force in article 2(4).\nAs such, the fact that NATO has publicly declared that the question is ‘when’ (not ‘if’) a cyber attack can enliven article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty is very strong evidence that the member States of NATO — all 30 of whom are also members of\n⁵⁸ Hinkle (n 56) 13.\n⁵⁹ Shackelford (n 48) 194.\n⁶⁰ NATO and Cyber Defence 2009 (n 53) 6 [25], 12 [59].\n⁶¹ Shackelford (n 48) 193; Schaap (n 3) 144; NATO and Cyber Defence 2009 (n 53) 12 [58]–[59].\n⁶² North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Member countries (Webpage, 24 September 2020) <https: en=\"\" ntolive=\"\" nanolive=\"\" topics_52044.htm=\"\" topics_52044.html=\"\" www.nato.int=\"\"> (‘NATO Member Webpage’).\n⁶³ NATO, Wales Summit Declaration, 5 September 2014, 72, cited in Gray (n 29) 35.

This is because the building up of offensive cyber capabilities in a State’s military can also be construed as an implicit stance that cyber attacks do not contravene article 2(4) of the UN Charter. Not only would one presume that a State would publicly invest only in military technologies that the State considers legal, but there is also the international law doctrine of *tu quoque* — that is, a State has no standing to claim a practice is illegal when the State is itself engaged in that practice.⁶⁷\nFurthermore, with the exception of the Estonian Government’s reaction to the cyber attacks in 2007, the States’ behaviour cited above does not make clear if their stances cover non-violent cyber attacks, violent cyber attacks, or both. It is similarly unclear from the above People’s Republic of China defence White Paper and the United States Cyber Command defence strategy whether those States were speaking with the threshold of article 2(4) in mind or rather some lower legal threshold concerning State relations, such as the prohibition against coercive intervention in another State’s internal affairs.⁶⁸\nAs a result, whilst individual State practice does lend some support to there being a prohibition under customary international law against non-violent cyber attacks, the development of such a prohibition remains ambiguous.⁶⁹\n## D. Conclusion as to customary international law\nConsequently, it is unclear whether customary international law does prohibit non-violent cyber attacks as an unlawful use of force. In each of the three evidentiary sources of United Nations General Assembly Resolutions, treaty law, and other State practice, there are either caveats or contradictory indications. Given this inconclusive evidence, the final step in this article’s analysis is to determine whether non-violent cyber attacks should be considered a ‘use of force’ under customary international law by reason of analogy.\n66 NATO Member Webpage (n 62); United Nations, *Member States* (Webpage) <https: about-us=\"\" member-states=\"\" www.un.org=\"\">.\n67 US Defense Report 1999 (n 3) 46, speaking in the context of peacetime espionage.\n68 That coercive intervention is a lower legal threshold than use of force is made clear in Michael N.

There is not yet any obvious mechanism for resolving the legal questions.’: Gray (n 29) 34–35.</https:>\nNON-VIOLENT CYBER ATTACKS: A CONTRAVENTION OF ARTICLE 2(4)?\n103\n# V ARE NON-VIOLENT CYBER ATTACKS ANALOGOUS TO ECONOMIC BLOCKADES?\nSince the shift in international legal discourse towards the 'living instrument' approach, it has become the accepted practice in international law to classify potential uses of force not on the basis of their mechanisms but on the effects directly caused.70 As a result, if the effects of non-violent cyber attacks can be shown to be comparable to the effects of other behaviour that is generally accepted to be a use of force, then one can legitimately conclude that these cyber attacks should also be considered a use of force under customary international law (and thus, potentially, under article 2(4) of the UN Charter).71\nOne particularly illustrative comparison is that of economic blockades, which are unilateral acts that interfere with trade between the victim State and all other parties (whether the other parties are willing and unwilling).72 Blockades are typically imposed through the presence of armed forces,73 and are considered an act of aggression (and thus an illegal use of force) under customary international law.74 For this reason, this article shall now compare the most egregious examples of non-violent cyber warfare to an economic blockade.\n## A. Similarity\nThe typical effects of a blockade on a victim State build gradually, and rarely involve immediate physical damage or human death. Instead, lack of access to materials and services in which the victim State previously traded (assuming it is not an economically-isolated State) typically leads to a slow degradation of production and economy. For example, if the victim State previously imported spare parts for its machinery, then its machines will continue to function as normal at the beginning of the blockade but eventually cease to function as the blockade continues, due to lack of spare parts.75 Thus, although the blockade has not directly inflicted any physical damage, over time it does so indirectly.\nIn these respects, non-violent cyber attacks can certainly create the same (indeed, even more pronounced) effects as an economic blockade. First, non-violent\n70 Resolution on the Definition of Aggression (n 26) annex art 2, cited in Todd (n 2) 76, 78 and in Blake and Imburgia (n 28) 188; Lin (n 4) 73; Nicaragua (Merits) (n 25) 103 [195] ('... the prohibition of armed attacks may apply to the sending by a State of armed bands to the territory of another State, if such an operation, because of its scale and effects, would have been classified as an armed attack rather than as a mere frontier incident had it been carried out by regular armed forces ...' (emphasis added)).\n71 See also Tallinn 2.0 (n 68) 331 ('A cyber operation constitutes a use of force when its scale and effects are comparable to non-cyber operations rising to the level of a use of force') in relation to cyber attacks in general, the prior version of which is cited in Gray (n 29) 34.\n72 Lin (n 4) 80.\n73 As recognised in article 42 of the UN Charter, which describes a blockade as an example of 'action by air, sea, or land forces'.\n74 Lin (n 4) 81–82. Resolution on the Definition of Aggression (n 26) annex art 3(c) specifically lists blockading a port or coast as an act of aggression ('The blockade of the ports or coasts of a State by the armed forces of another State'). Indeed, articles 41 and 42 of the UN Charter imply that blockades are a use of force, by referring to blockades as an example of 'action by air, sea, or land forces' that is available for the Security Council to take if 'measures not involving the use of armed force' are inadequate.\n75 Lin (n 4) 81–82.\nAUSTRALIAN INTERNATIONAL LAW JOURNAL\ncyber attacks can clandestinely change a machine manufacturing process within a victim State such that the resulting products pass initial testing but then become physically unreliable a short time afterwards.76 This would not only damage the victim State's export trade but, if the victim State also creates machines for its own use, lead to a gradual decline in its local equipment as well. Thus, the effects are almost identical to a blockade — disrupted trade relationships and gradual physical damage. Moreover, if the victim State cannot detect or nullify the cyber attack due to its clandestine nature, the victim State has even less ability to avoid its deleterious effects as the State would in an economic blockade.\nSecondly, non-violent cyber attacks have the ability of cutting off a victim State from all computerised trade. For example, a victim State's stock exchange system or banking systems could be repeatedly overloaded or disabled, resulting in any computerised market transactions becoming impossible.77 Like with a traditional economic blockade, the victim State thus has its trade with all its partners prevented by the unilateral actions of an aggressor. Indeed, this type of cyber attack has an even stronger effect than a traditional blockade, in that the cyber attack is preventing trade within the victim State as well as interstate trade.\n## B. Differences\nHowever, an important feature of economic blockades that is not found in non-violent cyber attacks is the distinct possibility of direct physical damage and human death. Unlike in cyber blockades, where access is blocked electronically and the victim State can — and usually has to — defend itself electronically, traditional economic blockades involve physical constraints and physical military threats. As such, for a victim State to end an economic blockade, the State must itself resort to armed force that will cause physical damage and likely human death.\nFurthermore, the instigator of a traditional economic blockade typically will be enforcing it with military assets that could, if the instigator desired, also directly cause physical damage and death against the victim State.\nIn other words, traditional economic blockades are a much stronger precursor to armed conflicts than non-violent cyber attacks, which may justify why they are more widely considered to be contraventions of customary international law than cyber attacks.\n## C. Conclusion as to economic blockade analogy\nIn consequence, using an effects-based analogy with economic blockades, one can argue only with moderate justification that non-violent cyber attacks should be considered a use of force under customary international law and article 2(4) of the UN Charter.\n76 Ibid 75.\n77 Ibid 74.\nNON-VIOLENT CYBER ATTACKS: A CONTRAVENTION OF ARTICLE 2(4)?\n105\n# VI CONCLUSION\nIn 1999, legal scholar Anthony D'Amato predicted that ‘attacks on the Internet will soon be seen as clearly illegal under international law’.78 Yet, despite this prediction and the continued willingness of member States and legal scholars in recent decades towards expanding the ambit of the UN Charter, there has been little corresponding agreement as to whether non-violent cyber-based attacks can come under the prohibition in article 2(4).\nIn the area of customary international law, the answer remains mostly ambiguous. The public statements of some States suggest that they believe non-violent cyber attacks can contravene article 2(4), yet those States’ practice indicates otherwise. Similarly, treaty law and General Assembly Resolutions provide only incidental — or conflicting — jurisprudence on cyber warfare’s relationship with article 2(4).\nPerhaps the strongest argument in favour of non-violent cyber attacks being capable of being a ‘use of force’ under article 2(4) is the analogy between non-violent cyber attacks and economic blockades, given their respective effects can be so similar. However, in the absence of clear treaty law or uniform State conduct, it would be surprising if such indirect legal reasoning was enough to change the application of article 2(4), which the ICJ once called a ‘comerstone’ of the UN Charter.79\nAccordingly, as far as article 2(4) of the UN Charter is concerned, it would appear that the day of Professor D'Amato’s prediction is yet to arrive.\n78 Anthony D'Amato, ‘International Law, Cybernetics, and Cyberspace’ (1999) 76 International Law Studies 59, cited in Waxman (n 4) 425.\n79 Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo (Democratic Republic of the Congo v.

This article examines that open question. It argues that, whilst the international community has taken some incremental steps towards updating and extending the prohibition to non-violent cyber attacks, those steps have not yet been clear or widespread enough to change that original exclusion from scope.\n## INTRODUCTION\nWhen the *Charter of the United Nations* came into force in 1945, the cyber world was not just yet to be militarised — it did not exist. It should therefore be of no surprise that the *UN Charter* does not include express regulation of cyber tools in military contexts. Yet, today, the advent of modern technology enables States to inflict major damage on one another without exhibiting the traditional hallmarks of conflict. The purpose of this article is therefore to examine whether the use of non-violent cyber attacks is included in the general prohibition on the ‘use of force’ by States in article 2(4) of the *UN Charter*.\nPart II of this article examines the original intent of article 2(4) and determines that cyber attacks were not within its original scope. Part III then contends that article 2(4) is a ‘living instrument’ capable of being given a modern interpretation beyond that of its 1940s origin. Part IV finds it unclear whether customary international law currently prohibits non-violent cyber attacks, which suggests that article 2(4) cannot be given an expansive interpretation to include non-violent cyber attacks. Finally, Part V determines that non-violent cyber attacks are not sufficiently similar to economic blockades, and therefore the same principles of customary international law cannot be extended to non-violent cyber attacks by analogy.\nFor the purposes of this article, ‘non-violent cyber attacks’ shall be taken to be States’ use of cyber-based tools to disrupt or corrupt other States’ computer networks in order to cause non-physical damage, such as widespread social or economic disruption. The reason this article will not focus on cyber attacks that\n---\n* BA/LLB (UNSW) Assistant Director, Australian Government.

The mere fact that a military action can easily be concealed is of no relevance to whether it is theoretically a use of force — for example, a State’s use of unmarked planes in a clandestine bombing raid is unambiguously still a use of force, despite its hidden nature. Indeed, the legality of an action under article 2(4) can even be determined in the hypothetical, where there is no attribution (difficult or otherwise) to be had.\n## II THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF ARTICLE 2(4)\nTo answer the question as to whether non-violent cyber attacks can be a ‘use of force’ for the purposes of article 2(4), it must first be determined what the drafters of the UN Charter originally intended by the phrase. To begin with, the full text of article 2(4) in the UN Charter is as follows:\nAll Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.\nUnder the customary rule of treaty interpretation enshrined in article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, the terms of the UN Charter are generally to be interpreted in accordance with their ordinary meaning in light of their context, object, and purpose. A contextual interpretation suggests that the prohibition of\n\nNON-VIOLENT CYBER ATTACKS: A CONTRAVENTION OF ARTICLE 2(4)?\n\nFurthermore, article 44 in the UN Charter also implies that ‘use of force’ is simply shorthand for ‘armed force’. Article 44 provides that the United Nations Security Council shall invite certain member States to contribute ‘armed forces … under Article 43’ when the Security Council has resolved to ‘use force’. If the phrase ‘use force’ is to include non-armed force like cyber attacks, then a logical inconsistency would arise in which the Security Council can resolve to use non-armed force but is empowered to ask member States to contribute armed force only. Again, on the reasonable presumption that the drafters did not intend such inconsistency, one must conclude that ‘use of force’ (with its close similarity to ‘use force’) refers only to armed force.\nThis confinement to armed force is reinforced when one has reference to the preparatory works of the UN Charter, in accordance with the customary rule enshrined in article 32 of the 1969 Vienna Convention. At the San Francisco Conference in which the UN Charter was drafted, the delegation from Brazil proposed the express insertion of economic measures into article 2(4). This proposal was rejected by twenty-six votes to two, indicating that the drafters consciously did not want to include economic coercion within the scope of ‘use of force’. Given that economic coercion was essentially the only non-armed means of inter-State antagonism in the 1940s, this reinforces that article 2(4) was originally intended to prohibit armed force only.\nIndeed, at various times during the early stages of the Cold War, member States of the United Nations raised the notion of article 2(4) applying beyond armed force,\nenshrined in the 1969 Vienna Convention can so apply (‘Without prejudice to the application of any rules set forth in the present Convention to which treaties would be subject under international law independently of the Convention …’).\n UN Charter Preamble (‘… to ensure, by the acceptance of principles and the institution of methods, that armed force shall not be used, save in the common interest…’) (emphasis added).\n Waxman (n 4) 428; Michael N Schmitt, ‘Computer Network Attack and the Use of Force in International Law: Thoughts on a Normative Framework’ (1999) 37 Columbia Journal of Transnational Law 885, 904.\n Schmitt (n 9) 904.\n UN Charter art 44 (‘When the Security Council has decided to use force it shall, before calling upon a Member not represented on it to provide armed forces in fulfilment of the obligations assumed under Article 43, invite that Member, if the Member so desires, to participate in the decisions of the Security Council concerning the employment of contingents of that Member’s armed forces.’).\n Schmitt (n 9) 904.\n Ibid 905; Michael Gervais, ‘Cyber Attacks and the Laws of War’ [2012] (Winter) 1 Journal of Law &lt;= Cyber Warfare 7, 26. For an interpretation to the contrary, see Ido Kilovaty, ‘Rethinking the Prohibition on the Use of Force in the Light of Economic Cyber Warfare: Towards a Broader Scope of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter’ (2015) 4(3) Journal of Law &lt;= Cyber Warfare 210, 230–231.\nAUSTRALIAN INTERNATIONAL LAW JOURNAL\nbut this expansion did not gain sufficient support in academia nor was it reflected in representative State practice. In 1970, international lawyer Thomas Franck even went so far as to declare that article 2(4) had been ‘killed’ due to its non-application (at the time) to the arming of insurgencies in proxy wars, which is an action more akin to traditional armed force than cyber attacks.\nFinally, for completeness, little guidance can be gleaned from the ‘against the territorial integrity or political independence’ qualifier to ‘use of force’ that is found in article 2(4). This is because the preparatory works of the UN Charter make it sufficiently clear that the qualifier is not meant to restrict the meaning of article 2(4). Moreover, the open-endedness of ‘or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations’ extends the scope of article 2(4) to virtually any ‘use of force’ that is not expressly authorised elsewhere in the UN Charter. It is thus clear that article 2(4) was considered — at least originally — to be limited to physical examples of force (indeed, only certain such examples), thus excluding cyber attacks.\n## III IS THE UN CHARTER A ‘LIVING INSTRUMENT’?\nDespite this clarity of original intent, article 2(4) has subsequently been treated as a ‘living instrument’ by two organs of the United Nations itself: the International Court of Justice and the United Nations General Assembly. Whilst neither of these organs has authority to amend the words of the UN Charter, their status within the United Nations accords them particularly authoritative weight in interpreting the UN Charter.\n\nNON-VIOLENT CYBER ATTACKS: A CONTRAVENTION OF ARTICLE 2(4)?\n\ninterpreted and applied within the framework of the entire legal system prevailing at the time of the interpretation.\nTherefore, by logical inference, the interpretation of the UN Charter must continuously change as the entire international legal system continuously changes around it.\nMore recently, the United Nations General Assembly has passed multiple Resolutions by considerable majority votes with the following preambulatory statement:\n… Confirming the conclusions of the Group of Governmental Experts, in its 2013 and 2015 reports, that international law, and in particular the Charter of the United Nations, is applicable and essential to maintaining peace and stability and promoting an open, secure, stable, accessible and peaceful information and communications technology environment …\nTherefore, one can see that the expansive ‘living instrument’ approach towards article 2(4), whilst by no means unanimous, has grounding in international legal discourse — including in the cyber context. As a consequence, it may in fact be possible for the general prohibition contained in article 2(4) of the UN Charter to be interpreted to include cyber attacks.\n Legal Consequences for States of the Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia (South West Africa) notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276 (1970) (Advisory Opinion) [1971] ICJ Rep 16, 31 [53] (emphasis added). Similarly, the International Court of Justice has expansively applied article 31(3)(c) of the 1969 Vienna Convention, which enshines the customary rule of treaty interpretation that ‘any relevant rules of international law applicable in relations between the parties [to the treaty being interpreted]’ are to be taken into account: Oil Platforms (Islamic Republic of Iran v.

This is relevant because, according to the International Court of Justice's above quotation from Namibia (Advisory Opinion), the entire legal system — including customary international law — affects the contemporary interpretation of the term 'use of force' in article 2(4). Accordingly, if the equivalent principles regarding uses of force extend to non-violent cyber attacks under customary international law, then there is good reason to argue that article 2(4) must be given the same expansive interpretation.\nCustomary international law is difficult to delineate precisely, but it can be sourced from international legal discourse. Of particular relevance for this article are three such evidentiary sources: United Nations General Assembly Resolutions, treaty law, and other forms of State practice that signify a legal duty is believed to exist.\n## A. General Assembly Resolutions\nIn 1974, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Resolution on the Definition of Aggression, to which was annexed the 'Definition of Aggression'. As recognised by the International Court of Justice in its 1986 judgment of Nicaragua v United States of America (Merits), the Resolution on the Definition of Aggression represents a significant source of customary international law concerning the use of force. The Resolution on the Definition of Aggression was also adopted by consensus, which enhances its potential influence on customary international law.\nWith a preambulatory statement that 'aggression' is the 'most serious and dangerous form of the illegal use of force' (a clear reflection of article 2(4) of the UN Charter), one of the non-exhaustive examples of aggression given in the Definition of Aggression annex to the Resolution on the Definition of Aggression is found in article 3(b) of the annex:\n All three sources' relevance to customary international law is cited in Military and Paramilitary Activities In and Against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States of America) (Merits) [1986] ICJ Rep 1986 ('Nicaragua (Merits)'), 99–100 [188]. For a non-exhaustive, but detailed, list of sources of customary international law, see Michael Wood, Special Rapporteur, Second report on identification of customary international law, International Law Commission, 66th Session, UN Doc A/CN.4/672 (1 October 2014) 22–33 [41]–[46].\n Resolution on the Definition of Aggression, GA Res 3314, UN GAOR, 34th sess, 2319th plen mtg, UN Doc A/Res/3314 (14 December 1974) ('Resolution on the Definition of Aggression').\n Nicaragua (Merits) (n 25) 103–104 [195].\n Wing Commander Duncan Blake and Lieutenant Colonel Joseph S Imburgia, “‘Bloodless weapons’?

Unfortunately, however, since the Resolution on the Definition of Aggression does not define its use of the term ‘weapon’, one must instead turn to other sources to extrapolate its meaning.\nOne possible means of clarification of the term ‘weapon’ comes from article 36 of the Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (Protocol I), 8 June 1977, which also uses the term. Although there is no definition of ‘weapon’ within the 1977 Additional Protocol I either, the accompanying official commentary from the International Committee of the Red Cross (‘ICRC’) puts ‘weapon’ so expansively that it appears almost certain to include cyber attacks. In particular, the ICRC commentary states that ‘weapon’ is to be construed ‘in the widest sense’ with respect to the way in which it is used, and does not necessarily need to be lethal. Thus, by linking the definition of ‘weapon’ contained in article 36 of the 1977 Additional Protocol I to the same word used in the Resolution on the Definition of Aggression, one could conclude that cyber attacks can be a ‘weapon’ of aggression and, therefore, capable of being an illegal use of force under customary international law.\nHowever, two important caveats must be made to this ‘weapon’ connection. First, the 1977 Additional Protocol I is a treaty concerning jus in bello (legality of conduct during conflict), whereas the Resolution on the Definition of Aggression and article 2(4) of the UN Charter concern jus ad bellum (legality of conflict commencement). As a result, the customary legal principles embodied in each are likely to be different from one another, thereby limiting their mutual applicability.\nSecondly, the existence of the same phrase in two different instruments of law does not necessarily mean that the same meaning is intended across both contexts. As a result, the term ‘weapon’ in the 1977 Additional Protocol I could well be denoting\n\nAUSTRALIAN INTERNATIONAL LAW JOURNAL\nsomething different to what is intended to be a ‘weapon’ under the Resolution on the Definition of Aggression.\nDue to these caveats to the application of the Resolution on the Definition of Aggression to non-violent cyber attacks, it is necessary to consider other sources of customary international law for greater clarity.\n## B. Treaty law\nThe second possible source of the illegality of cyber attacks comes from treaty law, which can both influence and codify principles of customary international law. One treaty that is of incidental relevance to cyber warfare is the Constitution and Convention of the International Telecommunication Union. Most relevantly, article 45 of the ITU Convention prohibits ‘harmful interference’ of radio services and communications of other members of the International Telecommunication Union. ‘Harmful interference’ is defined in the annex to the ITU Convention as:\nInterference which endangers the functioning of a radionavigation service or of other safety services or seriously degrades, obstructs or repeatedly interrupts a radio communication service . . .\nDespite containing no reference to ‘use of force’, article 45 of the ITU Convention is relevant in that it prohibits the blocking of telecommunication devices — a common effect of cyber attacks. Moreover, it is a treaty considered to apply primarily during peacetime, which is when the jus ad bellum parameters of article 2(4) of the UN Charter are relevant. As such, with its near-unanimous adoption, the ITU Convention represents at least a minor indication that non-violent cyber attacks are capable of contravening customary international law regarding the use of force, and thus potentially article 2(4) of the UN Charter as well.\nConversely, the Convention Respecting the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers and Persons in Case of War on Land 1907 is a treaty that could be shaping customary international law against a prohibition of non-violent cyber attacks. Under article 8 of the 1907 Neutrality Convention, a State’s neutrality is not violated by belligerents’ use of the State’s ‘telegraphy or telephone cables or … wireless telegraphy apparatus’. By contrast, the Resolution on the Definition of Aggression includes a State ‘allowing its territory… to be used by [another] State for perpetrating an act of\n Ibid 189.\n Nicaragua (Merits) (n 25) 94–95 (177).\n Constitution and Convention of the International Telecommunication Union, concluded 22 December 1992, 1825, 1826 UNTS (entered into force 1 July 1994) (‘ITU Constitution’ and ‘ITU Convention’).

In addition, there is nothing in the 1907 Neutrality Convention to suggest that it applies to the many types of modern technological systems that generate electronic information (such as satellite imagery and navigation systems), rather than just to those that simply relay communications ('telegraphy').46 Thus, the indication in the 1907 Neutrality Convention that cyber attacks are not a use of force should be considered relevant to the slightest degree only.\nAccordingly, treaty law does not provide strong or consistent guidance either.\n## C. Other State practice\nThe third evidentiary source of customary international law that could signify the status of cyber attacks is the individual conduct of the States themselves (as opposed to the collective acts of passing General Assembly resolutions and entering treaties). This is a well-recognised notion in which the conduct — both proactive and passive — and statements of member States can, if widespread and consistent enough, develop and reflect customary international law.47\nGiven that customary international law is most readily interpreted from the actions of States whose interests are specially affected,48 three member States whose approaches to cyber attacks are likely particularly relevant are the People's Republic of China (as the State with the most Internet users),49 the United States of America (as the most populous State with over 90% of the population using the Internet),50\n\nAUSTRALIAN INTERNATIONAL LAW JOURNAL\nand the Republic of Estonia (as a pioneer of online government services).[51] As such, their governments' public positions and actions would be particularly indicative.\nIn the case of the People's Republic of China, in 1999 the PLA Daily (the official media outlet for the State's army) publicly stated that 'internet warfare is of equal significance to land, sea and air power and requires its own military branch'.[52] Subsequently, in 2006, the State's defence White Paper stated that the army had the strategic goal of 'building informationized armed forces and being capable of winning informationized wars by the mid-21st century'.[53] Thus it seems the case that the People's Republic of China also views cyber attacks, like conventional military attacks, as having the potential to constitute a use of force.\nAs for the United States of America, in May 2012 the US Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta stated in an interview that the USA viewed a 'crippling' cyber attack as an 'act of war'.[54] More recently, in 2018, the United States Cyber Command stated that its strategy in relation to the 'warfighting domain' of cyberspace is to:\n... invest in cyber defense, resilience, and the continued integration of cyber capabilities into the full spectrum of military operations...[to] enable us to provide attribution while defending against and holding accountable state or non-state actors during cyberattacks ...[55]\nAs a result, the position of the USA appears also to be that cyber attacks can readily constitute a use of force under article 2(4) of the UN Charter.\nFinally, the Republic of Estonia represents a highly-connected State with the rare distinction of having suffered a significant non-violent cyber attack during peacetime, when 'denial-of-service' attacks over several days in 2007 shut down the country's online bank networks, media outlets, safety services, and government communication systems.[56] In the aftermath of the attack, which was estimated to have caused tens of millions of euros' worth in economic losses[57] but no physical or\nin the People's Republic of China and 43% in the Republic of India): The World Bank, Individuals using the Internet (% of population) (2022) <https: int.net.userzs=\"\" indicator=\"\" data.worldbank.org=\"\">.\n\nNON-VIOLENT CYBER ATTACKS: A CONTRAVENTION OF ARTICLE 2(4)? 101\nlong-term economic damage, the Speaker of the Estonian Parliament equated it with a nuclear explosion and the Estonian Defense Minister stated that cyber war represents the equivalent threat to the blockading of a country’s ports two hundred years ago (a blockade being a use of force under current international law — see Part IV below of this article). The Estonian Government even raised the prospect of invoking the collective self-defence mechanism of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (‘NATO’) in response to the cyber attacks. It is therefore clear from the Estonian Government’s actions that it, too, considers cyber attacks to be capable of constituting a use of force.\nIndeed, NATO — of which the USA and the Republic of Estonia are members — has itself made postures indicating that, as a collective regional organisation, it views cyber attacks as potentially constituting a use of force under article 2(4) of the UN Charter. In 2014, in its Wales Summit Declaration, NATO declared that:\n… international law, including international humanitarian law and the UN Charter, applies in cyberspace …. A decision as to when a cyber attack would lead to the invocation of Article 5 [of the North Atlantic Treaty] would be taken by the North Atlantic Council on a case-by-case basis.\nWhat is particularly pertinent here is that article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, which the Republic of Estonia sought to invoke in 2007, mirrors and expressly cites article 51 of the UN Charter. Article 51 of the UN Charter is enlivened if one State commits an ‘armed attack’ against another State, and ‘armed attack’ is widely interpreted to mean more egregious uses of force than those contemplated in article 2(4) of the UN Charter. In other words, by definition, any action that is an armed attack in article 51 must also be a use of force in article 2(4).\nAs such, the fact that NATO has publicly declared that the question is ‘when’ (not ‘if’) a cyber attack can enliven article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty is very strong evidence that the member States of NATO — all 30 of whom are also members of\n Hinkle (n 56) 13.\n Shackelford (n 48) 194.\n NATO and Cyber Defence 2009 (n 53) 6 [25], 12 [59].\n Shackelford (n 48) 193; Schaap (n 3) 144; NATO and Cyber Defence 2009 (n 53) 12 [58]–[59].\n North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Member countries (Webpage, 24 September 2020) <https: en=\"\" ntolive=\"\" nanolive=\"\" topics_52044.htm=\"\" topics_52044.html=\"\" www.nato.int=\"\"> (‘NATO Member Webpage’).\n NATO, Wales Summit Declaration, 5 September 2014, 72, cited in Gray (n 29) 35.

This is because the building up of offensive cyber capabilities in a State’s military can also be construed as an implicit stance that cyber attacks do not contravene article 2(4) of the UN Charter. Not only would one presume that a State would publicly invest only in military technologies that the State considers legal, but there is also the international law doctrine of *tu quoque* — that is, a State has no standing to claim a practice is illegal when the State is itself engaged in that practice.\nFurthermore, with the exception of the Estonian Government’s reaction to the cyber attacks in 2007, the States’ behaviour cited above does not make clear if their stances cover non-violent cyber attacks, violent cyber attacks, or both. It is similarly unclear from the above People’s Republic of China defence White Paper and the United States Cyber Command defence strategy whether those States were speaking with the threshold of article 2(4) in mind or rather some lower legal threshold concerning State relations, such as the prohibition against coercive intervention in another State’s internal affairs.\nAs a result, whilst individual State practice does lend some support to there being a prohibition under customary international law against non-violent cyber attacks, the development of such a prohibition remains ambiguous.\n## D. Conclusion as to customary international law\nConsequently, it is unclear whether customary international law does prohibit non-violent cyber attacks as an unlawful use of force. In each of the three evidentiary sources of United Nations General Assembly Resolutions, treaty law, and other State practice, there are either caveats or contradictory indications. Given this inconclusive evidence, the final step in this article’s analysis is to determine whether non-violent cyber attacks should be considered a ‘use of force’ under customary international law by reason of analogy.\n\nNON-VIOLENT CYBER ATTACKS: A CONTRAVENTION OF ARTICLE 2(4)?\n\nSince the shift in international legal discourse towards the 'living instrument' approach, it has become the accepted practice in international law to classify potential uses of force not on the basis of their mechanisms but on the effects directly caused.70 As a result, if the effects of non-violent cyber attacks can be shown to be comparable to the effects of other behaviour that is generally accepted to be a use of force, then one can legitimately conclude that these cyber attacks should also be considered a use of force under customary international law (and thus, potentially, under article 2(4) of the UN Charter).71\nOne particularly illustrative comparison is that of economic blockades, which are unilateral acts that interfere with trade between the victim State and all other parties (whether the other parties are willing and unwilling).72 Blockades are typically imposed through the presence of armed forces,73 and are considered an act of aggression (and thus an illegal use of force) under customary international law.74 For this reason, this article shall now compare the most egregious examples of non-violent cyber warfare to an economic blockade.\n## A. Similarity\nThe typical effects of a blockade on a victim State build gradually, and rarely involve immediate physical damage or human death. Instead, lack of access to materials and services in which the victim State previously traded (assuming it is not an economically-isolated State) typically leads to a slow degradation of production and economy. For example, if the victim State previously imported spare parts for its machinery, then its machines will continue to function as normal at the beginning of the blockade but eventually cease to function as the blockade continues, due to lack of spare parts.75 Thus, although the blockade has not directly inflicted any physical damage, over time it does so indirectly.\nIn these respects, non-violent cyber attacks can certainly create the same (indeed, even more pronounced) effects as an economic blockade. First, non-violent\n\nAUSTRALIAN INTERNATIONAL LAW JOURNAL\ncyber attacks can clandestinely change a machine manufacturing process within a victim State such that the resulting products pass initial testing but then become physically unreliable a short time afterwards.76 This would not only damage the victim State's export trade but, if the victim State also creates machines for its own use, lead to a gradual decline in its local equipment as well. Thus, the effects are almost identical to a blockade — disrupted trade relationships and gradual physical damage. Moreover, if the victim State cannot detect or nullify the cyber attack due to its clandestine nature, the victim State has even less ability to avoid its deleterious effects as the State would in an economic blockade.\nSecondly, non-violent cyber attacks have the ability of cutting off a victim State from all computerised trade. For example, a victim State's stock exchange system or banking systems could be repeatedly overloaded or disabled, resulting in any computerised market transactions becoming impossible.77 Like with a traditional economic blockade, the victim State thus has its trade with all its partners prevented by the unilateral actions of an aggressor. Indeed, this type of cyber attack has an even stronger effect than a traditional blockade, in that the cyber attack is preventing trade within the victim State as well as interstate trade.\n## B. Differences\nHowever, an important feature of economic blockades that is not found in non-violent cyber attacks is the distinct possibility of direct physical damage and human death. Unlike in cyber blockades, where access is blocked electronically and the victim State can — and usually has to — defend itself electronically, traditional economic blockades involve physical constraints and physical military threats. As such, for a victim State to end an economic blockade, the State must itself resort to armed force that will cause physical damage and likely human death.\nFurthermore, the instigator of a traditional economic blockade typically will be enforcing it with military assets that could, if the instigator desired, also directly cause physical damage and death against the victim State.\nIn other words, traditional economic blockades are a much stronger precursor to armed conflicts than non-violent cyber attacks, which may justify why they are more widely considered to be contraventions of customary international law than cyber attacks.\n## C. Conclusion as to economic blockade analogy\nIn consequence, using an effects-based analogy with economic blockades, one can argue only with moderate justification that non-violent cyber attacks should be considered a use of force under customary international law and article 2(4) of the UN Charter.\n\nNON-VIOLENT CYBER ATTACKS: A CONTRAVENTION OF ARTICLE 2(4)?\n\nIn 1999, legal scholar Anthony D'Amato predicted that ‘attacks on the Internet will soon be seen as clearly illegal under international law’.78 Yet, despite this prediction and the continued willingness of member States and legal scholars in recent decades towards expanding the ambit of the UN Charter, there has been little corresponding agreement as to whether non-violent cyber-based attacks can come under the prohibition in article 2(4).\nIn the area of customary international law, the answer remains mostly ambiguous. The public statements of some States suggest that they believe non-violent cyber attacks can contravene article 2(4), yet those States’ practice indicates otherwise. Similarly, treaty law and General Assembly Resolutions provide only incidental — or conflicting — jurisprudence on cyber warfare’s relationship with article 2(4).\nPerhaps the strongest argument in favour of non-violent cyber attacks being capable of being a ‘use of force’ under article 2(4) is the analogy between non-violent cyber attacks and economic blockades, given their respective effects can be so similar. However, in the absence of clear treaty law or uniform State conduct, it would be surprising if such indirect legal reasoning was enough to change the application of article 2(4), which the ICJ once called a ‘comerstone’ of the UN Charter.79\nAccordingly, as far as article 2(4) of the UN Charter is concerned, it would appear that the day of Professor D'Amato’s prediction is yet to arrive.\n\n^{}[]",

This article examines that open question. It argues that, whilst the international community has taken some incremental steps towards updating and extending the prohibition to non-violent cyber attacks, those steps have not yet been clear or widespread enough to change that original exclusion from scope.",
    "## INTRODUCTION": "When the *Charter of the United Nations*¹ came into force in 1945, the cyber world was not just yet to be militarised — it did not exist. It should therefore be of no surprise that the *UN Charter* does not include express regulation of cyber tools in military contexts. Yet, today, the advent of modern technology enables States to inflict major damage on one another without exhibiting the traditional hallmarks of conflict. The purpose of this article is therefore to examine whether the use of non-violent cyber attacks is included in the general prohibition on the ‘use of force’ by States in article 2(4) of the *UN Charter*.\nPart II of this article examines the original intent of article 2(4) and determines that cyber attacks were not within its original scope. Part III then contends that article 2(4) is a ‘living instrument’ capable of being given a modern interpretation beyond that of its 1940s origin. Part IV finds it unclear whether customary international law currently prohibits non-violent cyber attacks, which suggests that article 2(4) cannot be given an expansive interpretation to include non-violent cyber attacks. Finally, Part V determines that non-violent cyber attacks are not sufficiently similar to economic blockades, and therefore the same principles of customary international law cannot be extended to non-violent cyber attacks by analogy.\nFor the purposes of this article, ‘non-violent cyber attacks’ shall be taken to be States’ use of cyber-based tools to disrupt or corrupt other States’ computer networks in order to cause non-physical damage, such as widespread social or economic disruption. The reason this article will not focus on cyber attacks that\n---\n* BA/LLB (UNSW) Assistant Director, Australian Government.

The mere fact that a military action can easily be concealed is of no relevance to whether it is theoretically a use of force — for example, a State’s use of unmarked planes in a clandestine bombing raid is unambiguously still a use of force, despite its hidden nature. Indeed, the legality of an action under article 2(4) can even be determined in the hypothetical,⁵ where there is no attribution (difficult or otherwise) to be had.",
    "## II THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF ARTICLE 2(4)": "To answer the question as to whether non-violent cyber attacks can be a ‘use of force’ for the purposes of article 2(4), it must first be determined what the drafters of the UN Charter originally intended by the phrase. To begin with, the full text of article 2(4) in the UN Charter is as follows:\nAll Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.⁶\nUnder the customary rule of treaty interpretation enshrined in article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, the terms of the UN Charter are generally to be interpreted in accordance with their ordinary meaning in light of their context, object, and purpose.⁷ A contextual interpretation suggests that the prohibition of\n2 This example being drawn from Major Graham H Todd, ‘Armed attack in cyberspace: deterring asymmetric warfare with an asymmetric definition’  (Winter) 64 Air Force Law Review 65, 96.\n3 For examples of academic support for such an effects-based approach to cyber attacks, see: United States Department of Defense, *An Assessment of International Legal Issues in Information Operations* (May 1999) (‘US Defense Report 1999’), 18; Major Arie J Schaap ‘Cyber warfare operations: development and use under international law’ (2009) (Winter) 64 Air Force Law Review 121, 147–148, 172, citing Michael N Schmitt, ‘Wired Warfare: Computer Network Attack and Jus in Bello’ (2002) 84 International Review of the Red Cross 365. See also n 70.\n4 Herbert S Lin, ‘Offensive cyber operations and the use of force’ (2010) 4(1) Journal of National Security Law &amp; Policy 63, 77; Matthew C Waxman, ‘Cyber-attacks and the use of force: back to the future of article 2(4)’ (2011) 36(2) The Yale Journal of International Law 421, 443–447; Anna Wortham, ‘Should cyber exploitation ever constitute a demonstration of hostile intent that may violate UN Charter provisions prohibiting the threat or use of force?’ (2012) 64(3) Federal Communications Law Journal 643, 654; US Defense Report 1999 (n 3) 20–21.\n5 As demonstrated by the International Court of Justice’s ability to reach a conclusion regarding article 2(4) of the UN Charter and the use of nuclear weapons in *Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons* (Advisory Opinion)  ICJ Rep 1996 (‘Nuclear Weapons (Advisory Opinion)’), despite the absence of any use of nuclear weapons in conflict since the coming into effect of the UN Charter.\n6 UN Charter art 2(4).\n7 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, opened for signature 23 May 1969, 1155 UNTS 331 (entered into force 27 January 1980) (‘1969 Vienna Convention’) art 31. Whilst article 4 of the 1969 Vienna Convention provides that the 1969 Vienna Convention itself does not apply to the UN Charter (due to the UN Charter pre-dating the 1969 Vienna Convention), the article recognises that the customary international law\nNON-VIOLENT CYBER ATTACKS: A CONTRAVENTION OF ARTICLE 2(4)?\n93\nforce in article 2(4) is restricted to the traditional, kinetic types akin to those available in the WWII era. For instance, the Preamble to the UN Charter states that ‘armed force shall not be used, save in the common interest’⁸ — the term ‘armed’ implying a physical military dimension.⁹ Given that preambulatory statements are often conceptually more general than the articles that effectuate them, the inclusion of cyber attacks in article 2(4) would lead to an internal textual inconsistency in which a preambulatory term is narrower than its operative article. On the presumption that the drafters of the UN Charter did not intend to create such textual inconsistency, this suggests article 2(4) was not meant to include cyber attacks.¹⁰\nFurthermore, article 44 in the UN Charter also implies that ‘use of force’ is simply shorthand for ‘armed force’. Article 44 provides that the United Nations Security Council shall invite certain member States to contribute ‘armed forces … under Article 43’ when the Security Council has resolved to ‘use force’.¹¹ If the phrase ‘use force’ is to include non-armed force like cyber attacks, then a logical inconsistency would arise in which the Security Council can resolve to use non-armed force but is empowered to ask member States to contribute armed force only. Again, on the reasonable presumption that the drafters did not intend such inconsistency, one must conclude that ‘use of force’ (with its close similarity to ‘use force’) refers only to armed force.¹²\nThis confinement to armed force is reinforced when one has reference to the preparatory works of the UN Charter, in accordance with the customary rule enshrined in article 32 of the 1969 Vienna Convention. At the San Francisco Conference in which the UN Charter was drafted, the delegation from Brazil proposed the express insertion of economic measures into article 2(4). This proposal was rejected by twenty-six votes to two, indicating that the drafters consciously did not want to include economic coercion within the scope of ‘use of force’.¹³ Given that economic coercion was essentially the only non-armed means of inter-State antagonism in the 1940s, this reinforces that article 2(4) was originally intended to prohibit armed force only.\nIndeed, at various times during the early stages of the Cold War, member States of the United Nations raised the notion of article 2(4) applying beyond armed force,\nenshrined in the 1969 Vienna Convention can so apply (‘Without prejudice to the application of any rules set forth in the present Convention to which treaties would be subject under international law independently of the Convention …’).\n⁸ UN Charter Preamble (‘… to ensure, by the acceptance of principles and the institution of methods, that armed force shall not be used, save in the common interest…’) (emphasis added).\n⁹ Waxman (n 4) 428; Michael N Schmitt, ‘Computer Network Attack and the Use of Force in International Law: Thoughts on a Normative Framework’ (1999) 37 Columbia Journal of Transnational Law 885, 904.\n¹⁰ Schmitt (n 9) 904.\n¹¹ UN Charter art 44 (‘When the Security Council has decided to use force it shall, before calling upon a Member not represented on it to provide armed forces in fulfilment of the obligations assumed under Article 43, invite that Member, if the Member so desires, to participate in the decisions of the Security Council concerning the employment of contingents of that Member’s armed forces.’).\n¹² Schmitt (n 9) 904.\n¹³ Ibid 905; Michael Gervais, ‘Cyber Attacks and the Laws of War’  (Winter) 1 Journal of Law &lt;= Cyber Warfare 7, 26. For an interpretation to the contrary, see Ido Kilovaty, ‘Rethinking the Prohibition on the Use of Force in the Light of Economic Cyber Warfare: Towards a Broader Scope of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter’ (2015) 4(3) Journal of Law &lt;= Cyber Warfare 210, 230–231.\nAUSTRALIAN INTERNATIONAL LAW JOURNAL\nbut this expansion did not gain sufficient support in academia¹⁴ nor was it reflected in representative State practice.¹⁵ In 1970, international lawyer Thomas Franck even went so far as to declare that article 2(4) had been ‘killed’ due to its non-application (at the time) to the arming of insurgencies in proxy wars,¹⁶ which is an action more akin to traditional armed force than cyber attacks.\nFinally, for completeness, little guidance can be gleaned from the ‘against the territorial integrity or political independence’ qualifier to ‘use of force’ that is found in article 2(4). This is because the preparatory works of the UN Charter make it sufficiently clear that the qualifier is not meant to restrict the meaning of article 2(4).¹⁷ Moreover, the open-endedness of ‘or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations’ extends the scope of article 2(4) to virtually any ‘use of force’ that is not expressly authorised elsewhere in the UN Charter.¹⁸ It is thus clear that article 2(4) was considered — at least originally — to be limited to physical examples of force (indeed, only certain such examples), thus excluding cyber attacks.",
    "## III IS THE UN CHARTER A ‘LIVING INSTRUMENT’?": "Despite this clarity of original intent, article 2(4) has subsequently been treated as a ‘living instrument’ by two organs of the United Nations itself: the International Court of Justice and the United Nations General Assembly. Whilst neither of these organs has authority to amend the words of the UN Charter,¹⁹ their status within the United Nations accords them particularly authoritative weight in interpreting the UN Charter.²⁰\n14 Quincy Wright, ‘Subversive Intervention’ (1960) 54(3) The American Journal of International Law 521, 529 (‘It is clear that [its provisions] prohibit only the threat or use of armed force or an armed attack. They cannot be construed to include other hostile acts such as propaganda, infiltration or subversion.’), quoted in Waxman (n 4) 430.\n15 Waxman (n 4) 428–430, 449.\n16 Thomas M Franck, ‘Who Killed Article 2(4)? Or: Changing Norms Governing the Use of Force by States’ (1970) 64(4) The American Journal of International Law 809, 812, cited in Waxman (n 4) 441.\n17 James Crawford, *Brownlie’s Principles of Public International Law* (Oxford University Press, 8th ed, 2012) 747, citing Corfu Channel case (Judgment)  ICJ Rep 4, 35.\n18 Schmitt (n 9) 901. Of course, this does not answer what constitutes a ‘use of force’ in the first place.\n19 Amending the UN Charter effectively requires a two-thirds vote of the United Nations General Assembly, followed by ratification by two-thirds of Members (including the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council): UN Charter art 108 and 109.\n20 Under article 7 of the UN Charter, both the International Court of Justice and the General Assembly are ‘principal organs’ of the United Nations. The General Assembly comprises all members of the United Nations (article 9(1) of the UN Charter) and, in accordance with the customary rules of treaty interpretation enshrined in article 31(3)(a) and (b) of the 1969 Vienna Convention, practices or agreement amongst the United Nations members regarding the application of the UN Charter — such as United Nations General Assembly resolutions — can be relevant to the interpretation of the UN Charter. As for the authoritative weight of the International Court of Justice, the UN Charter states the Court to be the ‘principal judicial organ’ of the United Nations and every member to be a party to the Statute of the Court: articles 92 and 93(1) of the UN Charter. The US Department of Defense makes a similar point about the influence of the International Court of Justice and the United Nations General Assembly on customary international law: US Defense Report 1999 (n 3) 1 (‘…certain actions of some international institutions, such as the International Court of Justice and the UN General Assembly, are considered to be persuasive evidence of the existence of principles of customary international law’).\nNON-VIOLENT CYBER ATTACKS: A CONTRAVENTION OF ARTICLE 2(4)?\n95\nIn 1971, the International Court of Justice held that the UN Charter, as an international instrument, can — indeed, must — be:\ninterpreted and applied within the framework of the entire legal system prevailing at the time of the interpretation.²¹\nTherefore, by logical inference, the interpretation of the UN Charter must continuously change as the entire international legal system continuously changes around it.\nMore recently, the United Nations General Assembly has passed multiple Resolutions by considerable majority votes²² with the following preambulatory statement:\n… Confirming the conclusions of the Group of Governmental Experts, in its 2013 and 2015 reports, that international law, and in particular the Charter of the United Nations, is applicable and essential to maintaining peace and stability and promoting an open, secure, stable, accessible and peaceful information and communications technology environment …²³\nTherefore, one can see that the expansive ‘living instrument’ approach towards article 2(4), whilst by no means unanimous, has grounding in international legal discourse — including in the cyber context.²⁴ As a consequence, it may in fact be possible for the general prohibition contained in article 2(4) of the UN Charter to be interpreted to include cyber attacks.\n²¹ Legal Consequences for States of the Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia (South West Africa) notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276 (1970) (Advisory Opinion)  ICJ Rep 16, 31  (emphasis added). Similarly, the International Court of Justice has expansively applied article 31(3)(c) of the 1969 Vienna Convention, which enshines the customary rule of treaty interpretation that ‘any relevant rules of international law applicable in relations between the parties [to the treaty being interpreted]’ are to be taken into account: Oil Platforms (Islamic Republic of Iran v.

    "## IV DOES CUSTOMARY INTERNATIONAL LAW PROHIBIT NON-VIOLENT CYBER ATTACKS?": "Now that we can have some degree of certainty that article 2(4) of the UN Charter can be adapted to new modes of warfare, it becomes appropriate to ask whether customary international law has determined the legality of non-violent cyber attacks already. This is relevant because, according to the International Court of Justice's above quotation from Namibia (Advisory Opinion), the entire legal system — including customary international law — affects the contemporary interpretation of the term 'use of force' in article 2(4). Accordingly, if the equivalent principles regarding uses of force extend to non-violent cyber attacks under customary international law, then there is good reason to argue that article 2(4) must be given the same expansive interpretation.\nCustomary international law is difficult to delineate precisely, but it can be sourced from international legal discourse. Of particular relevance for this article are three such evidentiary sources: United Nations General Assembly Resolutions, treaty law, and other forms of State practice that signify a legal duty is believed to exist.²⁵",
    "## A. General Assembly Resolutions": "In 1974, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Resolution on the Definition of Aggression,²⁶ to which was annexed the 'Definition of Aggression'. As recognised by the International Court of Justice in its 1986 judgment of Nicaragua v United States of America (Merits), the Resolution on the Definition of Aggression represents a significant source of customary international law concerning the use of force.²⁷ The Resolution on the Definition of Aggression was also adopted by consensus,²⁸ which enhances its potential influence on customary international law.²⁹\nWith a preambulatory statement that 'aggression' is the 'most serious and dangerous form of the illegal use of force' (a clear reflection of article 2(4) of the UN Charter), one of the non-exhaustive examples of aggression given in the Definition of Aggression annex to the Resolution on the Definition of Aggression is found in article 3(b) of the annex:\n²⁵ All three sources' relevance to customary international law is cited in Military and Paramilitary Activities In and Against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v.

In particular, the ICRC commentary states that ‘weapon’ is to be construed ‘in the widest sense’ with respect to the way in which it is used, and does not necessarily need to be lethal.³⁴ Thus, by linking the definition of ‘weapon’ contained in article 36 of the 1977 Additional Protocol I to the same word used in the Resolution on the Definition of Aggression, one could conclude that cyber attacks can be a ‘weapon’ of aggression and, therefore, capable of being an illegal use of force under customary international law.³⁵\nHowever, two important caveats must be made to this ‘weapon’ connection. First, the 1977 Additional Protocol I is a treaty concerning jus in bello (legality of conduct during conflict), whereas the Resolution on the Definition of Aggression and article 2(4) of the UN Charter concern jus ad bellum (legality of conflict commencement). As a result, the customary legal principles embodied in each are likely to be different from one another, thereby limiting their mutual applicability.\nSecondly, the existence of the same phrase in two different instruments of law does not necessarily mean that the same meaning is intended across both contexts. As a result, the term ‘weapon’ in the 1977 Additional Protocol I could well be denoting\n30 Resolution on the Definition of Aggression (n 26) annex Preamble (‘... Considering also that, since aggression is the most serious and dangerous form of the illegal use of force ...’ (emphasis original)), art 3(b) (emphasis added).\n31 Todd makes a similar argument in relation to ‘armed attack’ under article 51 of the UN Charter.

    "## B. Treaty law": "The second possible source of the illegality of cyber attacks comes from treaty law, which can both influence and codify principles of customary international law.³⁷ One treaty that is of incidental relevance to cyber warfare is the Constitution and Convention of the International Telecommunication Union.³⁸ Most relevantly, article 45 of the ITU Convention prohibits ‘harmful interference’ of radio services and communications of other members of the International Telecommunication Union. ‘Harmful interference’ is defined in the annex to the ITU Convention as:\nInterference which endangers the functioning of a radionavigation service or of other safety services or seriously degrades, obstructs or repeatedly interrupts a radio communication service . . .³⁹\nDespite containing no reference to ‘use of force’, article 45 of the ITU Convention is relevant in that it prohibits the blocking of telecommunication devices — a common effect of cyber attacks. Moreover, it is a treaty considered to apply primarily during peacetime,⁴⁰ which is when the jus ad bellum parameters of article 2(4) of the UN Charter are relevant. As such, with its near-unanimous adoption,⁴¹ the ITU Convention represents at least a minor indication that non-violent cyber attacks are capable of contravening customary international law regarding the use of force, and thus potentially article 2(4) of the UN Charter as well.\nConversely, the Convention Respecting the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers and Persons in Case of War on Land 1907⁴² is a treaty that could be shaping customary international law against a prohibition of non-violent cyber attacks. Under article 8 of the 1907 Neutrality Convention, a State’s neutrality is not violated by belligerents’ use of the State’s ‘telegraphy or telephone cables or … wireless telegraphy apparatus’.⁴³ By contrast, the Resolution on the Definition of Aggression includes a State ‘allowing its territory… to be used by [another] State for perpetrating an act of\n³⁶ Ibid 189.\n³⁷ Nicaragua (Merits) (n 25) 94–95 (177).\n³⁸ Constitution and Convention of the International Telecommunication Union, concluded 22 December 1992, 1825, 1826 UNTS (entered into force 1 July 1994) (‘ITU Constitution’ and ‘ITU Convention’).

The predecessors to article 45 and the Annex to the ITU Constitution and Convention are cited and discussed in Schaap (n 3) 164–166 and US Defense Report 1999 (n 3) 32.\n³⁹ ITU Convention (n 38) annex, 1003.\n⁴⁰ US Defense Report 1999 (n 3) 33, referring to the predecessor to the ITU Constitution and Convention.\n⁴¹ International Telecommunication Union, Member States (2022) <https: en=\"\" itu-members=\"\" member-states=\"\" myitu=\"\" myitu=\"\" member-states=\"\" www.itu.int=\"\">.\n⁴² Convention (V) respecting the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers and Persons in Case of War on Land.

Thus, this suggests that cyber attacks are not a use of force under customary international law.45\nHaving said this, though, it is worth noting that the 1907 Neutrality Convention is of considerable age and thus is less likely to reflect today's customary international law, especially in the fast-changing realm of technology. In addition, there is nothing in the 1907 Neutrality Convention to suggest that it applies to the many types of modern technological systems that generate electronic information (such as satellite imagery and navigation systems), rather than just to those that simply relay communications ('telegraphy').46 Thus, the indication in the 1907 Neutrality Convention that cyber attacks are not a use of force should be considered relevant to the slightest degree only.\nAccordingly, treaty law does not provide strong or consistent guidance either.",
    "## C. Other State practice": "The third evidentiary source of customary international law that could signify the status of cyber attacks is the individual conduct of the States themselves (as opposed to the collective acts of passing General Assembly resolutions and entering treaties). This is a well-recognised notion in which the conduct — both proactive and passive — and statements of member States can, if widespread and consistent enough, develop and reflect customary international law.47\nGiven that customary international law is most readily interpreted from the actions of States whose interests are specially affected,48 three member States whose approaches to cyber attacks are likely particularly relevant are the People's Republic of China (as the State with the most Internet users),49 the United States of America (as the most populous State with over 90% of the population using the Internet),50\n44 Resolution on the Definition of Aggression (n 26) annex art 3(f) ('Any of the following acts, regardless of a declaration of war, shall, subject to and in accordance with the provisions of article 2, qualify as an act of aggression... The action of a State in allowing its territory, which it has placed at the disposal of another State, to be used by that other State for perpetrating an act of aggression against a third State').\n45 A similar conclusion is reached in Blake and Imburgia (n 28) 186–187 about the 1907 Neutrality Convention without reference to the Resolution on the Definition of Aggression.\n46 US Defense Report 1999 (n 3) 10.\n47 North Sea Continental Shelf (Federal Republic of Germany v Denmark; Federal Republic of Germany v Netherlands) (Judgment)  ICJ Rep 3 ('North Sea Continental Shelf'), 28–29 , 44 ; Nicaragua (Merits) (n 25) 98–100 –; Continental Shelf (Libyan Arab Jarnabiriya/Malta) (Judgment)  ICJ Rep 13, 29–30 ; Wood (n 25) 22–31 –.\n48 North Sea Continental Shelf (n 47) 41–42 –, partially cited in Scott J Shackelford, 'From nuclear war to net war: analogizing cyber attacks in international law' (2009) 27(1) Berkeley Journal of International Law 192, 218 and in ILC Draft Conclusions (n 23), 136–137.\n49 For a comparison of the total number of Internet users in different States in 2020, see Central Intelligence Agency, Field Listing — Internet Users (2022) <https: internet-users=\"\" file=\"\" file.=\"\" file.indd=\"\" www.cia.gov=\"\"></https:>. This estimates that there were 987 million Internet users in the People's Republic of China in 2020.\n50 The World Bank estimates that 90.9% of individuals in the United States of America were using the Internet in 2020, considerably higher than the percentages in the only two more populous States (70%\nAUSTRALIAN INTERNATIONAL LAW JOURNAL\nand the Republic of Estonia (as a pioneer of online government services). As such, their governments' public positions and actions would be particularly indicative.\nIn the case of the People's Republic of China, in 1999 the PLA Daily (the official media outlet for the State's army) publicly stated that 'internet warfare is of equal significance to land, sea and air power and requires its own military branch'. Subsequently, in 2006, the State's defence White Paper stated that the army had the strategic goal of 'building informationized armed forces and being capable of winning informationized wars by the mid-21st century'. Thus it seems the case that the People's Republic of China also views cyber attacks, like conventional military attacks, as having the potential to constitute a use of force.\nAs for the United States of America, in May 2012 the US Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta stated in an interview that the USA viewed a 'crippling' cyber attack as an 'act of war'. More recently, in 2018, the United States Cyber Command stated that its strategy in relation to the 'warfighting domain' of cyberspace is to:\n... invest in cyber defense, resilience, and the continued integration of cyber capabilities into the full spectrum of military operations...[to] enable us to provide attribution while defending against and holding accountable state or non-state actors during cyberattacks ...\nAs a result, the position of the USA appears also to be that cyber attacks can readily constitute a use of force under article 2(4) of the UN Charter.\nFinally, the Republic of Estonia represents a highly-connected State with the rare distinction of having suffered a significant non-violent cyber attack during peacetime, when 'denial-of-service' attacks over several days in 2007 shut down the country's online bank networks, media outlets, safety services, and government communication systems.

The Estonian Government even raised the prospect of invoking the collective self-defence mechanism of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (‘NATO’) in response to the cyber attacks.⁶¹ It is therefore clear from the Estonian Government’s actions that it, too, considers cyber attacks to be capable of constituting a use of force.\nIndeed, NATO — of which the USA and the Republic of Estonia are members⁶² — has itself made postures indicating that, as a collective regional organisation, it views cyber attacks as potentially constituting a use of force under article 2(4) of the UN Charter. In 2014, in its Wales Summit Declaration, NATO declared that:\n… international law, including international humanitarian law and the UN Charter, applies in cyberspace …. A decision as to when a cyber attack would lead to the invocation of Article 5 [of the North Atlantic Treaty] would be taken by the North Atlantic Council on a case-by-case basis.⁶³\nWhat is particularly pertinent here is that article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, which the Republic of Estonia sought to invoke in 2007, mirrors and expressly cites article 51 of the UN Charter.⁶⁴ Article 51 of the UN Charter is enlivened if one State commits an ‘armed attack’ against another State, and ‘armed attack’ is widely interpreted to mean more egregious uses of force than those contemplated in article 2(4) of the UN Charter.⁶⁵ In other words, by definition, any action that is an armed attack in article 51 must also be a use of force in article 2(4).\nAs such, the fact that NATO has publicly declared that the question is ‘when’ (not ‘if’) a cyber attack can enliven article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty is very strong evidence that the member States of NATO — all 30 of whom are also members of\n⁵⁸ Hinkle (n 56) 13.\n⁵⁹ Shackelford (n 48) 194.\n⁶⁰ NATO and Cyber Defence 2009 (n 53) 6 , 12 .\n⁶¹ Shackelford (n 48) 193; Schaap (n 3) 144; NATO and Cyber Defence 2009 (n 53) 12 –.\n⁶² North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Member countries (Webpage, 24 September 2020) <https: en=\"\" ntolive=\"\" nanolive=\"\" topics_52044.htm=\"\" topics_52044.html=\"\" www.nato.int=\"\"> (‘NATO Member Webpage’).\n⁶³ NATO, Wales Summit Declaration, 5 September 2014, 72, cited in Gray (n 29) 35.

This is because the building up of offensive cyber capabilities in a State’s military can also be construed as an implicit stance that cyber attacks do not contravene article 2(4) of the UN Charter. Not only would one presume that a State would publicly invest only in military technologies that the State considers legal, but there is also the international law doctrine of *tu quoque* — that is, a State has no standing to claim a practice is illegal when the State is itself engaged in that practice.⁶⁷\nFurthermore, with the exception of the Estonian Government’s reaction to the cyber attacks in 2007, the States’ behaviour cited above does not make clear if their stances cover non-violent cyber attacks, violent cyber attacks, or both. It is similarly unclear from the above People’s Republic of China defence White Paper and the United States Cyber Command defence strategy whether those States were speaking with the threshold of article 2(4) in mind or rather some lower legal threshold concerning State relations, such as the prohibition against coercive intervention in another State’s internal affairs.⁶⁸\nAs a result, whilst individual State practice does lend some support to there being a prohibition under customary international law against non-violent cyber attacks, the development of such a prohibition remains ambiguous.⁶⁹",
    "## D. Conclusion as to customary international law": "Consequently, it is unclear whether customary international law does prohibit non-violent cyber attacks as an unlawful use of force. In each of the three evidentiary sources of United Nations General Assembly Resolutions, treaty law, and other State practice, there are either caveats or contradictory indications. Given this inconclusive evidence, the final step in this article’s analysis is to determine whether non-violent cyber attacks should be considered a ‘use of force’ under customary international law by reason of analogy.\n66 NATO Member Webpage (n 62); United Nations, *Member States* (Webpage) <https: about-us=\"\" member-states=\"\" www.un.org=\"\">.\n67 US Defense Report 1999 (n 3) 46, speaking in the context of peacetime espionage.\n68 That coercive intervention is a lower legal threshold than use of force is made clear in Michael N.

    "__postscript__": "# V ARE NON-VIOLENT CYBER ATTACKS ANALOGOUS TO ECONOMIC BLOCKADES?\nSince the shift in international legal discourse towards the 'living instrument' approach, it has become the accepted practice in international law to classify potential uses of force not on the basis of their mechanisms but on the effects directly caused.70 As a result, if the effects of non-violent cyber attacks can be shown to be comparable to the effects of other behaviour that is generally accepted to be a use of force, then one can legitimately conclude that these cyber attacks should also be considered a use of force under customary international law (and thus, potentially, under article 2(4) of the UN Charter).71\nOne particularly illustrative comparison is that of economic blockades, which are unilateral acts that interfere with trade between the victim State and all other parties (whether the other parties are willing and unwilling).72 Blockades are typically imposed through the presence of armed forces,73 and are considered an act of aggression (and thus an illegal use of force) under customary international law.74 For this reason, this article shall now compare the most egregious examples of non-violent cyber warfare to an economic blockade.\n## A. Similarity\nThe typical effects of a blockade on a victim State build gradually, and rarely involve immediate physical damage or human death. Instead, lack of access to materials and services in which the victim State previously traded (assuming it is not an economically-isolated State) typically leads to a slow degradation of production and economy. For example, if the victim State previously imported spare parts for its machinery, then its machines will continue to function as normal at the beginning of the blockade but eventually cease to function as the blockade continues, due to lack of spare parts.75 Thus, although the blockade has not directly inflicted any physical damage, over time it does so indirectly.\nIn these respects, non-violent cyber attacks can certainly create the same (indeed, even more pronounced) effects as an economic blockade. First, non-violent\n70 Resolution on the Definition of Aggression (n 26) annex art 2, cited in Todd (n 2) 76, 78 and in Blake and Imburgia (n 28) 188; Lin (n 4) 73; Nicaragua (Merits) (n 25) 103  ('... the prohibition of armed attacks may apply to the sending by a State of armed bands to the territory of another State, if such an operation, because of its scale and effects, would have been classified as an armed attack rather than as a mere frontier incident had it been carried out by regular armed forces ...' (emphasis added)).\n71 See also Tallinn 2.0 (n 68) 331 ('A cyber operation constitutes a use of force when its scale and effects are comparable to non-cyber operations rising to the level of a use of force') in relation to cyber attacks in general, the prior version of which is cited in Gray (n 29) 34.\n72 Lin (n 4) 80.\n73 As recognised in article 42 of the UN Charter, which describes a blockade as an example of 'action by air, sea, or land forces'.\n74 Lin (n 4) 81–82. Resolution on the Definition of Aggression (n 26) annex art 3(c) specifically lists blockading a port or coast as an act of aggression ('The blockade of the ports or coasts of a State by the armed forces of another State'). Indeed, articles 41 and 42 of the UN Charter imply that blockades are a use of force, by referring to blockades as an example of 'action by air, sea, or land forces' that is available for the Security Council to take if 'measures not involving the use of armed force' are inadequate.\n75 Lin (n 4) 81–82.\nAUSTRALIAN INTERNATIONAL LAW JOURNAL\ncyber attacks can clandestinely change a machine manufacturing process within a victim State such that the resulting products pass initial testing but then become physically unreliable a short time afterwards.76 This would not only damage the victim State's export trade but, if the victim State also creates machines for its own use, lead to a gradual decline in its local equipment as well. Thus, the effects are almost identical to a blockade — disrupted trade relationships and gradual physical damage. Moreover, if the victim State cannot detect or nullify the cyber attack due to its clandestine nature, the victim State has even less ability to avoid its deleterious effects as the State would in an economic blockade.\nSecondly, non-violent cyber attacks have the ability of cutting off a victim State from all computerised trade. For example, a victim State's stock exchange system or banking systems could be repeatedly overloaded or disabled, resulting in any computerised market transactions becoming impossible.77 Like with a traditional economic blockade, the victim State thus has its trade with all its partners prevented by the unilateral actions of an aggressor. Indeed, this type of cyber attack has an even stronger effect than a traditional blockade, in that the cyber attack is preventing trade within the victim State as well as interstate trade.\n## B. Differences\nHowever, an important feature of economic blockades that is not found in non-violent cyber attacks is the distinct possibility of direct physical damage and human death. Unlike in cyber blockades, where access is blocked electronically and the victim State can — and usually has to — defend itself electronically, traditional economic blockades involve physical constraints and physical military threats. As such, for a victim State to end an economic blockade, the State must itself resort to armed force that will cause physical damage and likely human death.\nFurthermore, the instigator of a traditional economic blockade typically will be enforcing it with military assets that could, if the instigator desired, also directly cause physical damage and death against the victim State.\nIn other words, traditional economic blockades are a much stronger precursor to armed conflicts than non-violent cyber attacks, which may justify why they are more widely considered to be contraventions of customary international law than cyber attacks.\n## C. Conclusion as to economic blockade analogy\nIn consequence, using an effects-based analogy with economic blockades, one can argue only with moderate justification that non-violent cyber attacks should be considered a use of force under customary international law and article 2(4) of the UN Charter.\n76 Ibid 75.\n77 Ibid 74.\nNON-VIOLENT CYBER ATTACKS: A CONTRAVENTION OF ARTICLE 2(4)?\n105\n# VI CONCLUSION\nIn 1999, legal scholar Anthony D'Amato predicted that ‘attacks on the Internet will soon be seen as clearly illegal under international law’.78 Yet, despite this prediction and the continued willingness of member States and legal scholars in recent decades towards expanding the ambit of the UN Charter, there has been little corresponding agreement as to whether non-violent cyber-based attacks can come under the prohibition in article 2(4).\nIn the area of customary international law, the answer remains mostly ambiguous. The public statements of some States suggest that they believe non-violent cyber attacks can contravene article 2(4), yet those States’ practice indicates otherwise. Similarly, treaty law and General Assembly Resolutions provide only incidental — or conflicting — jurisprudence on cyber warfare’s relationship with article 2(4).\nPerhaps the strongest argument in favour of non-violent cyber attacks being capable of being a ‘use of force’ under article 2(4) is the analogy between non-violent cyber attacks and economic blockades, given their respective effects can be so similar. However, in the absence of clear treaty law or uniform State conduct, it would be surprising if such indirect legal reasoning was enough to change the application of article 2(4), which the ICJ once called a ‘comerstone’ of the UN Charter.79\nAccordingly, as far as article 2(4) of the UN Charter is concerned, it would appear that the day of Professor D'Amato’s prediction is yet to arrive.\n78 Anthony D'Amato, ‘International Law, Cybernetics, and Cyberspace’ (1999) 76 International Law Studies 59, cited in Waxman (n 4) 425.\n79 Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo (Democratic Republic of the Congo v.

This article examines that open question. It argues that, whilst the international community has taken some incremental steps towards updating and extending the prohibition to non-violent cyber attacks, those steps have not yet been clear or widespread enough to change that original exclusion from scope.\n## INTRODUCTION\nWhen the *Charter of the United Nations* came into force in 1945, the cyber world was not just yet to be militarised — it did not exist. It should therefore be of no surprise that the *UN Charter* does not include express regulation of cyber tools in military contexts. Yet, today, the advent of modern technology enables States to inflict major damage on one another without exhibiting the traditional hallmarks of conflict. The purpose of this article is therefore to examine whether the use of non-violent cyber attacks is included in the general prohibition on the ‘use of force’ by States in article 2(4) of the *UN Charter*.\nPart II of this article examines the original intent of article 2(4) and determines that cyber attacks were not within its original scope. Part III then contends that article 2(4) is a ‘living instrument’ capable of being given a modern interpretation beyond that of its 1940s origin. Part IV finds it unclear whether customary international law currently prohibits non-violent cyber attacks, which suggests that article 2(4) cannot be given an expansive interpretation to include non-violent cyber attacks. Finally, Part V determines that non-violent cyber attacks are not sufficiently similar to economic blockades, and therefore the same principles of customary international law cannot be extended to non-violent cyber attacks by analogy.\nFor the purposes of this article, ‘non-violent cyber attacks’ shall be taken to be States’ use of cyber-based tools to disrupt or corrupt other States’ computer networks in order to cause non-physical damage, such as widespread social or economic disruption. The reason this article will not focus on cyber attacks that\n---\n* BA/LLB (UNSW) Assistant Director, Australian Government.

The mere fact that a military action can easily be concealed is of no relevance to whether it is theoretically a use of force — for example, a State’s use of unmarked planes in a clandestine bombing raid is unambiguously still a use of force, despite its hidden nature. Indeed, the legality of an action under article 2(4) can even be determined in the hypothetical, where there is no attribution (difficult or otherwise) to be had.\n## II THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF ARTICLE 2(4)\nTo answer the question as to whether non-violent cyber attacks can be a ‘use of force’ for the purposes of article 2(4), it must first be determined what the drafters of the UN Charter originally intended by the phrase. To begin with, the full text of article 2(4) in the UN Charter is as follows:\nAll Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.\nUnder the customary rule of treaty interpretation enshrined in article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, the terms of the UN Charter are generally to be interpreted in accordance with their ordinary meaning in light of their context, object, and purpose. A contextual interpretation suggests that the prohibition of\n\nNON-VIOLENT CYBER ATTACKS: A CONTRAVENTION OF ARTICLE 2(4)?\n\nFurthermore, article 44 in the UN Charter also implies that ‘use of force’ is simply shorthand for ‘armed force’. Article 44 provides that the United Nations Security Council shall invite certain member States to contribute ‘armed forces … under Article 43’ when the Security Council has resolved to ‘use force’. If the phrase ‘use force’ is to include non-armed force like cyber attacks, then a logical inconsistency would arise in which the Security Council can resolve to use non-armed force but is empowered to ask member States to contribute armed force only. Again, on the reasonable presumption that the drafters did not intend such inconsistency, one must conclude that ‘use of force’ (with its close similarity to ‘use force’) refers only to armed force.\nThis confinement to armed force is reinforced when one has reference to the preparatory works of the UN Charter, in accordance with the customary rule enshrined in article 32 of the 1969 Vienna Convention. At the San Francisco Conference in which the UN Charter was drafted, the delegation from Brazil proposed the express insertion of economic measures into article 2(4). This proposal was rejected by twenty-six votes to two, indicating that the drafters consciously did not want to include economic coercion within the scope of ‘use of force’. Given that economic coercion was essentially the only non-armed means of inter-State antagonism in the 1940s, this reinforces that article 2(4) was originally intended to prohibit armed force only.\nIndeed, at various times during the early stages of the Cold War, member States of the United Nations raised the notion of article 2(4) applying beyond armed force,\nenshrined in the 1969 Vienna Convention can so apply (‘Without prejudice to the application of any rules set forth in the present Convention to which treaties would be subject under international law independently of the Convention …’).\n UN Charter Preamble (‘… to ensure, by the acceptance of principles and the institution of methods, that armed force shall not be used, save in the common interest…’) (emphasis added).\n Waxman (n 4) 428; Michael N Schmitt, ‘Computer Network Attack and the Use of Force in International Law: Thoughts on a Normative Framework’ (1999) 37 Columbia Journal of Transnational Law 885, 904.\n Schmitt (n 9) 904.\n UN Charter art 44 (‘When the Security Council has decided to use force it shall, before calling upon a Member not represented on it to provide armed forces in fulfilment of the obligations assumed under Article 43, invite that Member, if the Member so desires, to participate in the decisions of the Security Council concerning the employment of contingents of that Member’s armed forces.’).\n Schmitt (n 9) 904.\n Ibid 905; Michael Gervais, ‘Cyber Attacks and the Laws of War’ [2012] (Winter) 1 Journal of Law &lt;= Cyber Warfare 7, 26. For an interpretation to the contrary, see Ido Kilovaty, ‘Rethinking the Prohibition on the Use of Force in the Light of Economic Cyber Warfare: Towards a Broader Scope of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter’ (2015) 4(3) Journal of Law &lt;= Cyber Warfare 210, 230–231.\nAUSTRALIAN INTERNATIONAL LAW JOURNAL\nbut this expansion did not gain sufficient support in academia nor was it reflected in representative State practice. In 1970, international lawyer Thomas Franck even went so far as to declare that article 2(4) had been ‘killed’ due to its non-application (at the time) to the arming of insurgencies in proxy wars, which is an action more akin to traditional armed force than cyber attacks.\nFinally, for completeness, little guidance can be gleaned from the ‘against the territorial integrity or political independence’ qualifier to ‘use of force’ that is found in article 2(4). This is because the preparatory works of the UN Charter make it sufficiently clear that the qualifier is not meant to restrict the meaning of article 2(4). Moreover, the open-endedness of ‘or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations’ extends the scope of article 2(4) to virtually any ‘use of force’ that is not expressly authorised elsewhere in the UN Charter. It is thus clear that article 2(4) was considered — at least originally — to be limited to physical examples of force (indeed, only certain such examples), thus excluding cyber attacks.\n## III IS THE UN CHARTER A ‘LIVING INSTRUMENT’?\nDespite this clarity of original intent, article 2(4) has subsequently been treated as a ‘living instrument’ by two organs of the United Nations itself: the International Court of Justice and the United Nations General Assembly. Whilst neither of these organs has authority to amend the words of the UN Charter, their status within the United Nations accords them particularly authoritative weight in interpreting the UN Charter.\n\nNON-VIOLENT CYBER ATTACKS: A CONTRAVENTION OF ARTICLE 2(4)?\n\ninterpreted and applied within the framework of the entire legal system prevailing at the time of the interpretation.\nTherefore, by logical inference, the interpretation of the UN Charter must continuously change as the entire international legal system continuously changes around it.\nMore recently, the United Nations General Assembly has passed multiple Resolutions by considerable majority votes with the following preambulatory statement:\n… Confirming the conclusions of the Group of Governmental Experts, in its 2013 and 2015 reports, that international law, and in particular the Charter of the United Nations, is applicable and essential to maintaining peace and stability and promoting an open, secure, stable, accessible and peaceful information and communications technology environment …\nTherefore, one can see that the expansive ‘living instrument’ approach towards article 2(4), whilst by no means unanimous, has grounding in international legal discourse — including in the cyber context. As a consequence, it may in fact be possible for the general prohibition contained in article 2(4) of the UN Charter to be interpreted to include cyber attacks.\n Legal Consequences for States of the Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia (South West Africa) notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276 (1970) (Advisory Opinion) [1971] ICJ Rep 16, 31 [53] (emphasis added). Similarly, the International Court of Justice has expansively applied article 31(3)(c) of the 1969 Vienna Convention, which enshines the customary rule of treaty interpretation that ‘any relevant rules of international law applicable in relations between the parties [to the treaty being interpreted]’ are to be taken into account: Oil Platforms (Islamic Republic of Iran v.

This is relevant because, according to the International Court of Justice's above quotation from Namibia (Advisory Opinion), the entire legal system — including customary international law — affects the contemporary interpretation of the term 'use of force' in article 2(4). Accordingly, if the equivalent principles regarding uses of force extend to non-violent cyber attacks under customary international law, then there is good reason to argue that article 2(4) must be given the same expansive interpretation.\nCustomary international law is difficult to delineate precisely, but it can be sourced from international legal discourse. Of particular relevance for this article are three such evidentiary sources: United Nations General Assembly Resolutions, treaty law, and other forms of State practice that signify a legal duty is believed to exist.\n## A. General Assembly Resolutions\nIn 1974, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Resolution on the Definition of Aggression, to which was annexed the 'Definition of Aggression'. As recognised by the International Court of Justice in its 1986 judgment of Nicaragua v United States of America (Merits), the Resolution on the Definition of Aggression represents a significant source of customary international law concerning the use of force. The Resolution on the Definition of Aggression was also adopted by consensus, which enhances its potential influence on customary international law.\nWith a preambulatory statement that 'aggression' is the 'most serious and dangerous form of the illegal use of force' (a clear reflection of article 2(4) of the UN Charter), one of the non-exhaustive examples of aggression given in the Definition of Aggression annex to the Resolution on the Definition of Aggression is found in article 3(b) of the annex:\n All three sources' relevance to customary international law is cited in Military and Paramilitary Activities In and Against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States of America) (Merits) [1986] ICJ Rep 1986 ('Nicaragua (Merits)'), 99–100 [188]. For a non-exhaustive, but detailed, list of sources of customary international law, see Michael Wood, Special Rapporteur, Second report on identification of customary international law, International Law Commission, 66th Session, UN Doc A/CN.4/672 (1 October 2014) 22–33 [41]–[46].\n Resolution on the Definition of Aggression, GA Res 3314, UN GAOR, 34th sess, 2319th plen mtg, UN Doc A/Res/3314 (14 December 1974) ('Resolution on the Definition of Aggression').\n Nicaragua (Merits) (n 25) 103–104 [195].\n Wing Commander Duncan Blake and Lieutenant Colonel Joseph S Imburgia, “‘Bloodless weapons’?

Unfortunately, however, since the Resolution on the Definition of Aggression does not define its use of the term ‘weapon’, one must instead turn to other sources to extrapolate its meaning.\nOne possible means of clarification of the term ‘weapon’ comes from article 36 of the Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (Protocol I), 8 June 1977, which also uses the term. Although there is no definition of ‘weapon’ within the 1977 Additional Protocol I either, the accompanying official commentary from the International Committee of the Red Cross (‘ICRC’) puts ‘weapon’ so expansively that it appears almost certain to include cyber attacks. In particular, the ICRC commentary states that ‘weapon’ is to be construed ‘in the widest sense’ with respect to the way in which it is used, and does not necessarily need to be lethal. Thus, by linking the definition of ‘weapon’ contained in article 36 of the 1977 Additional Protocol I to the same word used in the Resolution on the Definition of Aggression, one could conclude that cyber attacks can be a ‘weapon’ of aggression and, therefore, capable of being an illegal use of force under customary international law.\nHowever, two important caveats must be made to this ‘weapon’ connection. First, the 1977 Additional Protocol I is a treaty concerning jus in bello (legality of conduct during conflict), whereas the Resolution on the Definition of Aggression and article 2(4) of the UN Charter concern jus ad bellum (legality of conflict commencement). As a result, the customary legal principles embodied in each are likely to be different from one another, thereby limiting their mutual applicability.\nSecondly, the existence of the same phrase in two different instruments of law does not necessarily mean that the same meaning is intended across both contexts. As a result, the term ‘weapon’ in the 1977 Additional Protocol I could well be denoting\n\nAUSTRALIAN INTERNATIONAL LAW JOURNAL\nsomething different to what is intended to be a ‘weapon’ under the Resolution on the Definition of Aggression.\nDue to these caveats to the application of the Resolution on the Definition of Aggression to non-violent cyber attacks, it is necessary to consider other sources of customary international law for greater clarity.\n## B. Treaty law\nThe second possible source of the illegality of cyber attacks comes from treaty law, which can both influence and codify principles of customary international law. One treaty that is of incidental relevance to cyber warfare is the Constitution and Convention of the International Telecommunication Union. Most relevantly, article 45 of the ITU Convention prohibits ‘harmful interference’ of radio services and communications of other members of the International Telecommunication Union. ‘Harmful interference’ is defined in the annex to the ITU Convention as:\nInterference which endangers the functioning of a radionavigation service or of other safety services or seriously degrades, obstructs or repeatedly interrupts a radio communication service . . .\nDespite containing no reference to ‘use of force’, article 45 of the ITU Convention is relevant in that it prohibits the blocking of telecommunication devices — a common effect of cyber attacks. Moreover, it is a treaty considered to apply primarily during peacetime, which is when the jus ad bellum parameters of article 2(4) of the UN Charter are relevant. As such, with its near-unanimous adoption, the ITU Convention represents at least a minor indication that non-violent cyber attacks are capable of contravening customary international law regarding the use of force, and thus potentially article 2(4) of the UN Charter as well.\nConversely, the Convention Respecting the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers and Persons in Case of War on Land 1907 is a treaty that could be shaping customary international law against a prohibition of non-violent cyber attacks. Under article 8 of the 1907 Neutrality Convention, a State’s neutrality is not violated by belligerents’ use of the State’s ‘telegraphy or telephone cables or … wireless telegraphy apparatus’. By contrast, the Resolution on the Definition of Aggression includes a State ‘allowing its territory… to be used by [another] State for perpetrating an act of\n Ibid 189.\n Nicaragua (Merits) (n 25) 94–95 (177).\n Constitution and Convention of the International Telecommunication Union, concluded 22 December 1992, 1825, 1826 UNTS (entered into force 1 July 1994) (‘ITU Constitution’ and ‘ITU Convention’).

In addition, there is nothing in the 1907 Neutrality Convention to suggest that it applies to the many types of modern technological systems that generate electronic information (such as satellite imagery and navigation systems), rather than just to those that simply relay communications ('telegraphy').46 Thus, the indication in the 1907 Neutrality Convention that cyber attacks are not a use of force should be considered relevant to the slightest degree only.\nAccordingly, treaty law does not provide strong or consistent guidance either.\n## C. Other State practice\nThe third evidentiary source of customary international law that could signify the status of cyber attacks is the individual conduct of the States themselves (as opposed to the collective acts of passing General Assembly resolutions and entering treaties). This is a well-recognised notion in which the conduct — both proactive and passive — and statements of member States can, if widespread and consistent enough, develop and reflect customary international law.47\nGiven that customary international law is most readily interpreted from the actions of States whose interests are specially affected,48 three member States whose approaches to cyber attacks are likely particularly relevant are the People's Republic of China (as the State with the most Internet users),49 the United States of America (as the most populous State with over 90% of the population using the Internet),50\n\nAUSTRALIAN INTERNATIONAL LAW JOURNAL\nand the Republic of Estonia (as a pioneer of online government services).[51] As such, their governments' public positions and actions would be particularly indicative.\nIn the case of the People's Republic of China, in 1999 the PLA Daily (the official media outlet for the State's army) publicly stated that 'internet warfare is of equal significance to land, sea and air power and requires its own military branch'.[52] Subsequently, in 2006, the State's defence White Paper stated that the army had the strategic goal of 'building informationized armed forces and being capable of winning informationized wars by the mid-21st century'.[53] Thus it seems the case that the People's Republic of China also views cyber attacks, like conventional military attacks, as having the potential to constitute a use of force.\nAs for the United States of America, in May 2012 the US Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta stated in an interview that the USA viewed a 'crippling' cyber attack as an 'act of war'.[54] More recently, in 2018, the United States Cyber Command stated that its strategy in relation to the 'warfighting domain' of cyberspace is to:\n... invest in cyber defense, resilience, and the continued integration of cyber capabilities into the full spectrum of military operations...[to] enable us to provide attribution while defending against and holding accountable state or non-state actors during cyberattacks ...[55]\nAs a result, the position of the USA appears also to be that cyber attacks can readily constitute a use of force under article 2(4) of the UN Charter.\nFinally, the Republic of Estonia represents a highly-connected State with the rare distinction of having suffered a significant non-violent cyber attack during peacetime, when 'denial-of-service' attacks over several days in 2007 shut down the country's online bank networks, media outlets, safety services, and government communication systems.[56] In the aftermath of the attack, which was estimated to have caused tens of millions of euros' worth in economic losses[57] but no physical or\nin the People's Republic of China and 43% in the Republic of India): The World Bank, Individuals using the Internet (% of population) (2022) <https: int.net.userzs=\"\" indicator=\"\" data.worldbank.org=\"\">.\n\nNON-VIOLENT CYBER ATTACKS: A CONTRAVENTION OF ARTICLE 2(4)? 101\nlong-term economic damage, the Speaker of the Estonian Parliament equated it with a nuclear explosion and the Estonian Defense Minister stated that cyber war represents the equivalent threat to the blockading of a country’s ports two hundred years ago (a blockade being a use of force under current international law — see Part IV below of this article). The Estonian Government even raised the prospect of invoking the collective self-defence mechanism of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (‘NATO’) in response to the cyber attacks. It is therefore clear from the Estonian Government’s actions that it, too, considers cyber attacks to be capable of constituting a use of force.\nIndeed, NATO — of which the USA and the Republic of Estonia are members — has itself made postures indicating that, as a collective regional organisation, it views cyber attacks as potentially constituting a use of force under article 2(4) of the UN Charter. In 2014, in its Wales Summit Declaration, NATO declared that:\n… international law, including international humanitarian law and the UN Charter, applies in cyberspace …. A decision as to when a cyber attack would lead to the invocation of Article 5 [of the North Atlantic Treaty] would be taken by the North Atlantic Council on a case-by-case basis.\nWhat is particularly pertinent here is that article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, which the Republic of Estonia sought to invoke in 2007, mirrors and expressly cites article 51 of the UN Charter. Article 51 of the UN Charter is enlivened if one State commits an ‘armed attack’ against another State, and ‘armed attack’ is widely interpreted to mean more egregious uses of force than those contemplated in article 2(4) of the UN Charter. In other words, by definition, any action that is an armed attack in article 51 must also be a use of force in article 2(4).\nAs such, the fact that NATO has publicly declared that the question is ‘when’ (not ‘if’) a cyber attack can enliven article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty is very strong evidence that the member States of NATO — all 30 of whom are also members of\n Hinkle (n 56) 13.\n Shackelford (n 48) 194.\n NATO and Cyber Defence 2009 (n 53) 6 [25], 12 [59].\n Shackelford (n 48) 193; Schaap (n 3) 144; NATO and Cyber Defence 2009 (n 53) 12 [58]–[59].\n North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Member countries (Webpage, 24 September 2020) <https: en=\"\" ntolive=\"\" nanolive=\"\" topics_52044.htm=\"\" topics_52044.html=\"\" www.nato.int=\"\"> (‘NATO Member Webpage’).\n NATO, Wales Summit Declaration, 5 September 2014, 72, cited in Gray (n 29) 35.

This is because the building up of offensive cyber capabilities in a State’s military can also be construed as an implicit stance that cyber attacks do not contravene article 2(4) of the UN Charter. Not only would one presume that a State would publicly invest only in military technologies that the State considers legal, but there is also the international law doctrine of *tu quoque* — that is, a State has no standing to claim a practice is illegal when the State is itself engaged in that practice.\nFurthermore, with the exception of the Estonian Government’s reaction to the cyber attacks in 2007, the States’ behaviour cited above does not make clear if their stances cover non-violent cyber attacks, violent cyber attacks, or both. It is similarly unclear from the above People’s Republic of China defence White Paper and the United States Cyber Command defence strategy whether those States were speaking with the threshold of article 2(4) in mind or rather some lower legal threshold concerning State relations, such as the prohibition against coercive intervention in another State’s internal affairs.\nAs a result, whilst individual State practice does lend some support to there being a prohibition under customary international law against non-violent cyber attacks, the development of such a prohibition remains ambiguous.\n## D. Conclusion as to customary international law\nConsequently, it is unclear whether customary international law does prohibit non-violent cyber attacks as an unlawful use of force. In each of the three evidentiary sources of United Nations General Assembly Resolutions, treaty law, and other State practice, there are either caveats or contradictory indications. Given this inconclusive evidence, the final step in this article’s analysis is to determine whether non-violent cyber attacks should be considered a ‘use of force’ under customary international law by reason of analogy.\n\nNON-VIOLENT CYBER ATTACKS: A CONTRAVENTION OF ARTICLE 2(4)?\n\nSince the shift in international legal discourse towards the 'living instrument' approach, it has become the accepted practice in international law to classify potential uses of force not on the basis of their mechanisms but on the effects directly caused.70 As a result, if the effects of non-violent cyber attacks can be shown to be comparable to the effects of other behaviour that is generally accepted to be a use of force, then one can legitimately conclude that these cyber attacks should also be considered a use of force under customary international law (and thus, potentially, under article 2(4) of the UN Charter).71\nOne particularly illustrative comparison is that of economic blockades, which are unilateral acts that interfere with trade between the victim State and all other parties (whether the other parties are willing and unwilling).72 Blockades are typically imposed through the presence of armed forces,73 and are considered an act of aggression (and thus an illegal use of force) under customary international law.74 For this reason, this article shall now compare the most egregious examples of non-violent cyber warfare to an economic blockade.\n## A. Similarity\nThe typical effects of a blockade on a victim State build gradually, and rarely involve immediate physical damage or human death. Instead, lack of access to materials and services in which the victim State previously traded (assuming it is not an economically-isolated State) typically leads to a slow degradation of production and economy. For example, if the victim State previously imported spare parts for its machinery, then its machines will continue to function as normal at the beginning of the blockade but eventually cease to function as the blockade continues, due to lack of spare parts.75 Thus, although the blockade has not directly inflicted any physical damage, over time it does so indirectly.\nIn these respects, non-violent cyber attacks can certainly create the same (indeed, even more pronounced) effects as an economic blockade. First, non-violent\n\nAUSTRALIAN INTERNATIONAL LAW JOURNAL\ncyber attacks can clandestinely change a machine manufacturing process within a victim State such that the resulting products pass initial testing but then become physically unreliable a short time afterwards.76 This would not only damage the victim State's export trade but, if the victim State also creates machines for its own use, lead to a gradual decline in its local equipment as well. Thus, the effects are almost identical to a blockade — disrupted trade relationships and gradual physical damage. Moreover, if the victim State cannot detect or nullify the cyber attack due to its clandestine nature, the victim State has even less ability to avoid its deleterious effects as the State would in an economic blockade.\nSecondly, non-violent cyber attacks have the ability of cutting off a victim State from all computerised trade. For example, a victim State's stock exchange system or banking systems could be repeatedly overloaded or disabled, resulting in any computerised market transactions becoming impossible.77 Like with a traditional economic blockade, the victim State thus has its trade with all its partners prevented by the unilateral actions of an aggressor. Indeed, this type of cyber attack has an even stronger effect than a traditional blockade, in that the cyber attack is preventing trade within the victim State as well as interstate trade.\n## B. Differences\nHowever, an important feature of economic blockades that is not found in non-violent cyber attacks is the distinct possibility of direct physical damage and human death. Unlike in cyber blockades, where access is blocked electronically and the victim State can — and usually has to — defend itself electronically, traditional economic blockades involve physical constraints and physical military threats. As such, for a victim State to end an economic blockade, the State must itself resort to armed force that will cause physical damage and likely human death.\nFurthermore, the instigator of a traditional economic blockade typically will be enforcing it with military assets that could, if the instigator desired, also directly cause physical damage and death against the victim State.\nIn other words, traditional economic blockades are a much stronger precursor to armed conflicts than non-violent cyber attacks, which may justify why they are more widely considered to be contraventions of customary international law than cyber attacks.\n## C. Conclusion as to economic blockade analogy\nIn consequence, using an effects-based analogy with economic blockades, one can argue only with moderate justification that non-violent cyber attacks should be considered a use of force under customary international law and article 2(4) of the UN Charter.\n\nNON-VIOLENT CYBER ATTACKS: A CONTRAVENTION OF ARTICLE 2(4)?\n\nIn 1999, legal scholar Anthony D'Amato predicted that ‘attacks on the Internet will soon be seen as clearly illegal under international law’.78 Yet, despite this prediction and the continued willingness of member States and legal scholars in recent decades towards expanding the ambit of the UN Charter, there has been little corresponding agreement as to whether non-violent cyber-based attacks can come under the prohibition in article 2(4).\nIn the area of customary international law, the answer remains mostly ambiguous. The public statements of some States suggest that they believe non-violent cyber attacks can contravene article 2(4), yet those States’ practice indicates otherwise. Similarly, treaty law and General Assembly Resolutions provide only incidental — or conflicting — jurisprudence on cyber warfare’s relationship with article 2(4).\nPerhaps the strongest argument in favour of non-violent cyber attacks being capable of being a ‘use of force’ under article 2(4) is the analogy between non-violent cyber attacks and economic blockades, given their respective effects can be so similar. However, in the absence of clear treaty law or uniform State conduct, it would be surprising if such indirect legal reasoning was enough to change the application of article 2(4), which the ICJ once called a ‘comerstone’ of the UN Charter.79\nAccordingly, as far as article 2(4) of the UN Charter is concerned, it would appear that the day of Professor D'Amato’s prediction is yet to arrive.\n\n^{}[]",

This article examines that open question. It argues that, whilst the international community has taken some incremental steps towards updating and extending the prohibition to non-violent cyber attacks, those steps have not yet been clear or widespread enough to change that original exclusion from scope.\n## INTRODUCTION\nWhen the *Charter of the United Nations* came into force in 1945, the cyber world was not just yet to be militarised — it did not exist. It should therefore be of no surprise that the *UN Charter* does not include express regulation of cyber tools in military contexts. Yet, today, the advent of modern technology enables States to inflict major damage on one another without exhibiting the traditional hallmarks of conflict. The purpose of this article is therefore to examine whether the use of non-violent cyber attacks is included in the general prohibition on the ‘use of force’ by States in article 2(4) of the *UN Charter*.\nPart II of this article examines the original intent of article 2(4) and determines that cyber attacks were not within its original scope. Part III then contends that article 2(4) is a ‘living instrument’ capable of being given a modern interpretation beyond that of its 1940s origin. Part IV finds it unclear whether customary international law currently prohibits non-violent cyber attacks, which suggests that article 2(4) cannot be given an expansive interpretation to include non-violent cyber attacks. Finally, Part V determines that non-violent cyber attacks are not sufficiently similar to economic blockades, and therefore the same principles of customary international law cannot be extended to non-violent cyber attacks by analogy.\nFor the purposes of this article, ‘non-violent cyber attacks’ shall be taken to be States’ use of cyber-based tools to disrupt or corrupt other States’ computer networks in order to cause non-physical damage, such as widespread social or economic disruption. The reason this article will not focus on cyber attacks that\n---\n* BA/LLB (UNSW) Assistant Director, Australian Government.

The mere fact that a military action can easily be concealed is of no relevance to whether it is theoretically a use of force — for example, a State’s use of unmarked planes in a clandestine bombing raid is unambiguously still a use of force, despite its hidden nature. Indeed, the legality of an action under article 2(4) can even be determined in the hypothetical, where there is no attribution (difficult or otherwise) to be had.\n## II THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF ARTICLE 2(4)\nTo answer the question as to whether non-violent cyber attacks can be a ‘use of force’ for the purposes of article 2(4), it must first be determined what the drafters of the UN Charter originally intended by the phrase. To begin with, the full text of article 2(4) in the UN Charter is as follows:\nAll Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.\nUnder the customary rule of treaty interpretation enshrined in article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, the terms of the UN Charter are generally to be interpreted in accordance with their ordinary meaning in light of their context, object, and purpose. A contextual interpretation suggests that the prohibition of\n\nNON-VIOLENT CYBER ATTACKS: A CONTRAVENTION OF ARTICLE 2(4)?\n\nFurthermore, article 44 in the UN Charter also implies that ‘use of force’ is simply shorthand for ‘armed force’. Article 44 provides that the United Nations Security Council shall invite certain member States to contribute ‘armed forces … under Article 43’ when the Security Council has resolved to ‘use force’. If the phrase ‘use force’ is to include non-armed force like cyber attacks, then a logical inconsistency would arise in which the Security Council can resolve to use non-armed force but is empowered to ask member States to contribute armed force only. Again, on the reasonable presumption that the drafters did not intend such inconsistency, one must conclude that ‘use of force’ (with its close similarity to ‘use force’) refers only to armed force.\nThis confinement to armed force is reinforced when one has reference to the preparatory works of the UN Charter, in accordance with the customary rule enshrined in article 32 of the 1969 Vienna Convention. At the San Francisco Conference in which the UN Charter was drafted, the delegation from Brazil proposed the express insertion of economic measures into article 2(4). This proposal was rejected by twenty-six votes to two, indicating that the drafters consciously did not want to include economic coercion within the scope of ‘use of force’. Given that economic coercion was essentially the only non-armed means of inter-State antagonism in the 1940s, this reinforces that article 2(4) was originally intended to prohibit armed force only.\nIndeed, at various times during the early stages of the Cold War, member States of the United Nations raised the notion of article 2(4) applying beyond armed force,\nenshrined in the 1969 Vienna Convention can so apply (‘Without prejudice to the application of any rules set forth in the present Convention to which treaties would be subject under international law independently of the Convention …’).\n UN Charter Preamble (‘… to ensure, by the acceptance of principles and the institution of methods, that armed force shall not be used, save in the common interest…’) (emphasis added).\n Waxman (n 4) 428; Michael N Schmitt, ‘Computer Network Attack and the Use of Force in International Law: Thoughts on a Normative Framework’ (1999) 37 Columbia Journal of Transnational Law 885, 904.\n Schmitt (n 9) 904.\n UN Charter art 44 (‘When the Security Council has decided to use force it shall, before calling upon a Member not represented on it to provide armed forces in fulfilment of the obligations assumed under Article 43, invite that Member, if the Member so desires, to participate in the decisions of the Security Council concerning the employment of contingents of that Member’s armed forces.’).\n Schmitt (n 9) 904.\n Ibid 905; Michael Gervais, ‘Cyber Attacks and the Laws of War’ [2012] (Winter) 1 Journal of Law &lt;= Cyber Warfare 7, 26. For an interpretation to the contrary, see Ido Kilovaty, ‘Rethinking the Prohibition on the Use of Force in the Light of Economic Cyber Warfare: Towards a Broader Scope of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter’ (2015) 4(3) Journal of Law &lt;= Cyber Warfare 210, 230–231.\nAUSTRALIAN INTERNATIONAL LAW JOURNAL\nbut this expansion did not gain sufficient support in academia nor was it reflected in representative State practice. In 1970, international lawyer Thomas Franck even went so far as to declare that article 2(4) had been ‘killed’ due to its non-application (at the time) to the arming of insurgencies in proxy wars, which is an action more akin to traditional armed force than cyber attacks.\nFinally, for completeness, little guidance can be gleaned from the ‘against the territorial integrity or political independence’ qualifier to ‘use of force’ that is found in article 2(4). This is because the preparatory works of the UN Charter make it sufficiently clear that the qualifier is not meant to restrict the meaning of article 2(4). Moreover, the open-endedness of ‘or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations’ extends the scope of article 2(4) to virtually any ‘use of force’ that is not expressly authorised elsewhere in the UN Charter. It is thus clear that article 2(4) was considered — at least originally — to be limited to physical examples of force (indeed, only certain such examples), thus excluding cyber attacks.\n## III IS THE UN CHARTER A ‘LIVING INSTRUMENT’?\nDespite this clarity of original intent, article 2(4) has subsequently been treated as a ‘living instrument’ by two organs of the United Nations itself: the International Court of Justice and the United Nations General Assembly. Whilst neither of these organs has authority to amend the words of the UN Charter, their status within the United Nations accords them particularly authoritative weight in interpreting the UN Charter.\n\nNON-VIOLENT CYBER ATTACKS: A CONTRAVENTION OF ARTICLE 2(4)?\n\ninterpreted and applied within the framework of the entire legal system prevailing at the time of the interpretation.\nTherefore, by logical inference, the interpretation of the UN Charter must continuously change as the entire international legal system continuously changes around it.\nMore recently, the United Nations General Assembly has passed multiple Resolutions by considerable majority votes with the following preambulatory statement:\n… Confirming the conclusions of the Group of Governmental Experts, in its 2013 and 2015 reports, that international law, and in particular the Charter of the United Nations, is applicable and essential to maintaining peace and stability and promoting an open, secure, stable, accessible and peaceful information and communications technology environment …\nTherefore, one can see that the expansive ‘living instrument’ approach towards article 2(4), whilst by no means unanimous, has grounding in international legal discourse — including in the cyber context. As a consequence, it may in fact be possible for the general prohibition contained in article 2(4) of the UN Charter to be interpreted to include cyber attacks.\n Legal Consequences for States of the Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia (South West Africa) notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276 (1970) (Advisory Opinion) [1971] ICJ Rep 16, 31 [53] (emphasis added). Similarly, the International Court of Justice has expansively applied article 31(3)(c) of the 1969 Vienna Convention, which enshines the customary rule of treaty interpretation that ‘any relevant rules of international law applicable in relations between the parties [to the treaty being interpreted]’ are to be taken into account: Oil Platforms (Islamic Republic of Iran v.

This is relevant because, according to the International Court of Justice's above quotation from Namibia (Advisory Opinion), the entire legal system — including customary international law — affects the contemporary interpretation of the term 'use of force' in article 2(4). Accordingly, if the equivalent principles regarding uses of force extend to non-violent cyber attacks under customary international law, then there is good reason to argue that article 2(4) must be given the same expansive interpretation.\nCustomary international law is difficult to delineate precisely, but it can be sourced from international legal discourse. Of particular relevance for this article are three such evidentiary sources: United Nations General Assembly Resolutions, treaty law, and other forms of State practice that signify a legal duty is believed to exist.\n## A. General Assembly Resolutions\nIn 1974, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Resolution on the Definition of Aggression, to which was annexed the 'Definition of Aggression'. As recognised by the International Court of Justice in its 1986 judgment of Nicaragua v United States of America (Merits), the Resolution on the Definition of Aggression represents a significant source of customary international law concerning the use of force. The Resolution on the Definition of Aggression was also adopted by consensus, which enhances its potential influence on customary international law.\nWith a preambulatory statement that 'aggression' is the 'most serious and dangerous form of the illegal use of force' (a clear reflection of article 2(4) of the UN Charter), one of the non-exhaustive examples of aggression given in the Definition of Aggression annex to the Resolution on the Definition of Aggression is found in article 3(b) of the annex:\n All three sources' relevance to customary international law is cited in Military and Paramilitary Activities In and Against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States of America) (Merits) [1986] ICJ Rep 1986 ('Nicaragua (Merits)'), 99–100 [188]. For a non-exhaustive, but detailed, list of sources of customary international law, see Michael Wood, Special Rapporteur, Second report on identification of customary international law, International Law Commission, 66th Session, UN Doc A/CN.4/672 (1 October 2014) 22–33 [41]–[46].\n Resolution on the Definition of Aggression, GA Res 3314, UN GAOR, 34th sess, 2319th plen mtg, UN Doc A/Res/3314 (14 December 1974) ('Resolution on the Definition of Aggression').\n Nicaragua (Merits) (n 25) 103–104 [195].\n Wing Commander Duncan Blake and Lieutenant Colonel Joseph S Imburgia, “‘Bloodless weapons’?

Unfortunately, however, since the Resolution on the Definition of Aggression does not define its use of the term ‘weapon’, one must instead turn to other sources to extrapolate its meaning.\nOne possible means of clarification of the term ‘weapon’ comes from article 36 of the Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (Protocol I), 8 June 1977, which also uses the term. Although there is no definition of ‘weapon’ within the 1977 Additional Protocol I either, the accompanying official commentary from the International Committee of the Red Cross (‘ICRC’) puts ‘weapon’ so expansively that it appears almost certain to include cyber attacks. In particular, the ICRC commentary states that ‘weapon’ is to be construed ‘in the widest sense’ with respect to the way in which it is used, and does not necessarily need to be lethal. Thus, by linking the definition of ‘weapon’ contained in article 36 of the 1977 Additional Protocol I to the same word used in the Resolution on the Definition of Aggression, one could conclude that cyber attacks can be a ‘weapon’ of aggression and, therefore, capable of being an illegal use of force under customary international law.\nHowever, two important caveats must be made to this ‘weapon’ connection. First, the 1977 Additional Protocol I is a treaty concerning jus in bello (legality of conduct during conflict), whereas the Resolution on the Definition of Aggression and article 2(4) of the UN Charter concern jus ad bellum (legality of conflict commencement). As a result, the customary legal principles embodied in each are likely to be different from one another, thereby limiting their mutual applicability.\nSecondly, the existence of the same phrase in two different instruments of law does not necessarily mean that the same meaning is intended across both contexts. As a result, the term ‘weapon’ in the 1977 Additional Protocol I could well be denoting\n\nAUSTRALIAN INTERNATIONAL LAW JOURNAL\nsomething different to what is intended to be a ‘weapon’ under the Resolution on the Definition of Aggression.\nDue to these caveats to the application of the Resolution on the Definition of Aggression to non-violent cyber attacks, it is necessary to consider other sources of customary international law for greater clarity.\n## B. Treaty law\nThe second possible source of the illegality of cyber attacks comes from treaty law, which can both influence and codify principles of customary international law. One treaty that is of incidental relevance to cyber warfare is the Constitution and Convention of the International Telecommunication Union. Most relevantly, article 45 of the ITU Convention prohibits ‘harmful interference’ of radio services and communications of other members of the International Telecommunication Union. ‘Harmful interference’ is defined in the annex to the ITU Convention as:\nInterference which endangers the functioning of a radionavigation service or of other safety services or seriously degrades, obstructs or repeatedly interrupts a radio communication service . . .\nDespite containing no reference to ‘use of force’, article 45 of the ITU Convention is relevant in that it prohibits the blocking of telecommunication devices — a common effect of cyber attacks. Moreover, it is a treaty considered to apply primarily during peacetime, which is when the jus ad bellum parameters of article 2(4) of the UN Charter are relevant. As such, with its near-unanimous adoption, the ITU Convention represents at least a minor indication that non-violent cyber attacks are capable of contravening customary international law regarding the use of force, and thus potentially article 2(4) of the UN Charter as well.\nConversely, the Convention Respecting the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers and Persons in Case of War on Land 1907 is a treaty that could be shaping customary international law against a prohibition of non-violent cyber attacks. Under article 8 of the 1907 Neutrality Convention, a State’s neutrality is not violated by belligerents’ use of the State’s ‘telegraphy or telephone cables or … wireless telegraphy apparatus’. By contrast, the Resolution on the Definition of Aggression includes a State ‘allowing its territory… to be used by [another] State for perpetrating an act of\n Ibid 189.\n Nicaragua (Merits) (n 25) 94–95 (177).\n Constitution and Convention of the International Telecommunication Union, concluded 22 December 1992, 1825, 1826 UNTS (entered into force 1 July 1994) (‘ITU Constitution’ and ‘ITU Convention’).

In addition, there is nothing in the 1907 Neutrality Convention to suggest that it applies to the many types of modern technological systems that generate electronic information (such as satellite imagery and navigation systems), rather than just to those that simply relay communications ('telegraphy').46 Thus, the indication in the 1907 Neutrality Convention that cyber attacks are not a use of force should be considered relevant to the slightest degree only.\nAccordingly, treaty law does not provide strong or consistent guidance either.\n## C. Other State practice\nThe third evidentiary source of customary international law that could signify the status of cyber attacks is the individual conduct of the States themselves (as opposed to the collective acts of passing General Assembly resolutions and entering treaties). This is a well-recognised notion in which the conduct — both proactive and passive — and statements of member States can, if widespread and consistent enough, develop and reflect customary international law.47\nGiven that customary international law is most readily interpreted from the actions of States whose interests are specially affected,48 three member States whose approaches to cyber attacks are likely particularly relevant are the People's Republic of China (as the State with the most Internet users),49 the United States of America (as the most populous State with over 90% of the population using the Internet),50\n\nAUSTRALIAN INTERNATIONAL LAW JOURNAL\nand the Republic of Estonia (as a pioneer of online government services).[51] As such, their governments' public positions and actions would be particularly indicative.\nIn the case of the People's Republic of China, in 1999 the PLA Daily (the official media outlet for the State's army) publicly stated that 'internet warfare is of equal significance to land, sea and air power and requires its own military branch'.[52] Subsequently, in 2006, the State's defence White Paper stated that the army had the strategic goal of 'building informationized armed forces and being capable of winning informationized wars by the mid-21st century'.[53] Thus it seems the case that the People's Republic of China also views cyber attacks, like conventional military attacks, as having the potential to constitute a use of force.\nAs for the United States of America, in May 2012 the US Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta stated in an interview that the USA viewed a 'crippling' cyber attack as an 'act of war'.[54] More recently, in 2018, the United States Cyber Command stated that its strategy in relation to the 'warfighting domain' of cyberspace is to:\n... invest in cyber defense, resilience, and the continued integration of cyber capabilities into the full spectrum of military operations...[to] enable us to provide attribution while defending against and holding accountable state or non-state actors during cyberattacks ...[55]\nAs a result, the position of the USA appears also to be that cyber attacks can readily constitute a use of force under article 2(4) of the UN Charter.\nFinally, the Republic of Estonia represents a highly-connected State with the rare distinction of having suffered a significant non-violent cyber attack during peacetime, when 'denial-of-service' attacks over several days in 2007 shut down the country's online bank networks, media outlets, safety services, and government communication systems.[56] In the aftermath of the attack, which was estimated to have caused tens of millions of euros' worth in economic losses[57] but no physical or\nin the People's Republic of China and 43% in the Republic of India): The World Bank, Individuals using the Internet (% of population) (2022) <https: int.net.userzs=\"\" indicator=\"\" data.worldbank.org=\"\">.\n\nNON-VIOLENT CYBER ATTACKS: A CONTRAVENTION OF ARTICLE 2(4)? 101\nlong-term economic damage, the Speaker of the Estonian Parliament equated it with a nuclear explosion and the Estonian Defense Minister stated that cyber war represents the equivalent threat to the blockading of a country’s ports two hundred years ago (a blockade being a use of force under current international law — see Part IV below of this article). The Estonian Government even raised the prospect of invoking the collective self-defence mechanism of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (‘NATO’) in response to the cyber attacks. It is therefore clear from the Estonian Government’s actions that it, too, considers cyber attacks to be capable of constituting a use of force.\nIndeed, NATO — of which the USA and the Republic of Estonia are members — has itself made postures indicating that, as a collective regional organisation, it views cyber attacks as potentially constituting a use of force under article 2(4) of the UN Charter. In 2014, in its Wales Summit Declaration, NATO declared that:\n… international law, including international humanitarian law and the UN Charter, applies in cyberspace …. A decision as to when a cyber attack would lead to the invocation of Article 5 [of the North Atlantic Treaty] would be taken by the North Atlantic Council on a case-by-case basis.\nWhat is particularly pertinent here is that article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, which the Republic of Estonia sought to invoke in 2007, mirrors and expressly cites article 51 of the UN Charter. Article 51 of the UN Charter is enlivened if one State commits an ‘armed attack’ against another State, and ‘armed attack’ is widely interpreted to mean more egregious uses of force than those contemplated in article 2(4) of the UN Charter. In other words, by definition, any action that is an armed attack in article 51 must also be a use of force in article 2(4).\nAs such, the fact that NATO has publicly declared that the question is ‘when’ (not ‘if’) a cyber attack can enliven article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty is very strong evidence that the member States of NATO — all 30 of whom are also members of\n Hinkle (n 56) 13.\n Shackelford (n 48) 194.\n NATO and Cyber Defence 2009 (n 53) 6 [25], 12 [59].\n Shackelford (n 48) 193; Schaap (n 3) 144; NATO and Cyber Defence 2009 (n 53) 12 [58]–[59].\n North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Member countries (Webpage, 24 September 2020) <https: en=\"\" ntolive=\"\" nanolive=\"\" topics_52044.htm=\"\" topics_52044.html=\"\" www.nato.int=\"\"> (‘NATO Member Webpage’).\n NATO, Wales Summit Declaration, 5 September 2014, 72, cited in Gray (n 29) 35.

This is because the building up of offensive cyber capabilities in a State’s military can also be construed as an implicit stance that cyber attacks do not contravene article 2(4) of the UN Charter. Not only would one presume that a State would publicly invest only in military technologies that the State considers legal, but there is also the international law doctrine of *tu quoque* — that is, a State has no standing to claim a practice is illegal when the State is itself engaged in that practice.\nFurthermore, with the exception of the Estonian Government’s reaction to the cyber attacks in 2007, the States’ behaviour cited above does not make clear if their stances cover non-violent cyber attacks, violent cyber attacks, or both. It is similarly unclear from the above People’s Republic of China defence White Paper and the United States Cyber Command defence strategy whether those States were speaking with the threshold of article 2(4) in mind or rather some lower legal threshold concerning State relations, such as the prohibition against coercive intervention in another State’s internal affairs.\nAs a result, whilst individual State practice does lend some support to there being a prohibition under customary international law against non-violent cyber attacks, the development of such a prohibition remains ambiguous.\n## D. Conclusion as to customary international law\nConsequently, it is unclear whether customary international law does prohibit non-violent cyber attacks as an unlawful use of force. In each of the three evidentiary sources of United Nations General Assembly Resolutions, treaty law, and other State practice, there are either caveats or contradictory indications. Given this inconclusive evidence, the final step in this article’s analysis is to determine whether non-violent cyber attacks should be considered a ‘use of force’ under customary international law by reason of analogy.\n\nNON-VIOLENT CYBER ATTACKS: A CONTRAVENTION OF ARTICLE 2(4)?\n\nSince the shift in international legal discourse towards the 'living instrument' approach, it has become the accepted practice in international law to classify potential uses of force not on the basis of their mechanisms but on the effects directly caused.70 As a result, if the effects of non-violent cyber attacks can be shown to be comparable to the effects of other behaviour that is generally accepted to be a use of force, then one can legitimately conclude that these cyber attacks should also be considered a use of force under customary international law (and thus, potentially, under article 2(4) of the UN Charter).71\nOne particularly illustrative comparison is that of economic blockades, which are unilateral acts that interfere with trade between the victim State and all other parties (whether the other parties are willing and unwilling).72 Blockades are typically imposed through the presence of armed forces,73 and are considered an act of aggression (and thus an illegal use of force) under customary international law.74 For this reason, this article shall now compare the most egregious examples of non-violent cyber warfare to an economic blockade.\n## A. Similarity\nThe typical effects of a blockade on a victim State build gradually, and rarely involve immediate physical damage or human death. Instead, lack of access to materials and services in which the victim State previously traded (assuming it is not an economically-isolated State) typically leads to a slow degradation of production and economy. For example, if the victim State previously imported spare parts for its machinery, then its machines will continue to function as normal at the beginning of the blockade but eventually cease to function as the blockade continues, due to lack of spare parts.75 Thus, although the blockade has not directly inflicted any physical damage, over time it does so indirectly.\nIn these respects, non-violent cyber attacks can certainly create the same (indeed, even more pronounced) effects as an economic blockade. First, non-violent\n\nAUSTRALIAN INTERNATIONAL LAW JOURNAL\ncyber attacks can clandestinely change a machine manufacturing process within a victim State such that the resulting products pass initial testing but then become physically unreliable a short time afterwards.76 This would not only damage the victim State's export trade but, if the victim State also creates machines for its own use, lead to a gradual decline in its local equipment as well. Thus, the effects are almost identical to a blockade — disrupted trade relationships and gradual physical damage. Moreover, if the victim State cannot detect or nullify the cyber attack due to its clandestine nature, the victim State has even less ability to avoid its deleterious effects as the State would in an economic blockade.\nSecondly, non-violent cyber attacks have the ability of cutting off a victim State from all computerised trade. For example, a victim State's stock exchange system or banking systems could be repeatedly overloaded or disabled, resulting in any computerised market transactions becoming impossible.77 Like with a traditional economic blockade, the victim State thus has its trade with all its partners prevented by the unilateral actions of an aggressor. Indeed, this type of cyber attack has an even stronger effect than a traditional blockade, in that the cyber attack is preventing trade within the victim State as well as interstate trade.\n## B. Differences\nHowever, an important feature of economic blockades that is not found in non-violent cyber attacks is the distinct possibility of direct physical damage and human death. Unlike in cyber blockades, where access is blocked electronically and the victim State can — and usually has to — defend itself electronically, traditional economic blockades involve physical constraints and physical military threats. As such, for a victim State to end an economic blockade, the State must itself resort to armed force that will cause physical damage and likely human death.\nFurthermore, the instigator of a traditional economic blockade typically will be enforcing it with military assets that could, if the instigator desired, also directly cause physical damage and death against the victim State.\nIn other words, traditional economic blockades are a much stronger precursor to armed conflicts than non-violent cyber attacks, which may justify why they are more widely considered to be contraventions of customary international law than cyber attacks.\n## C. Conclusion as to economic blockade analogy\nIn consequence, using an effects-based analogy with economic blockades, one can argue only with moderate justification that non-violent cyber attacks should be considered a use of force under customary international law and article 2(4) of the UN Charter.\n\nNON-VIOLENT CYBER ATTACKS: A CONTRAVENTION OF ARTICLE 2(4)?\n\nIn 1999, legal scholar Anthony D'Amato predicted that ‘attacks on the Internet will soon be seen as clearly illegal under international law’.78 Yet, despite this prediction and the continued willingness of member States and legal scholars in recent decades towards expanding the ambit of the UN Charter, there has been little corresponding agreement as to whether non-violent cyber-based attacks can come under the prohibition in article 2(4).\nIn the area of customary international law, the answer remains mostly ambiguous. The public statements of some States suggest that they believe non-violent cyber attacks can contravene article 2(4), yet those States’ practice indicates otherwise. Similarly, treaty law and General Assembly Resolutions provide only incidental — or conflicting — jurisprudence on cyber warfare’s relationship with article 2(4).\nPerhaps the strongest argument in favour of non-violent cyber attacks being capable of being a ‘use of force’ under article 2(4) is the analogy between non-violent cyber attacks and economic blockades, given their respective effects can be so similar. However, in the absence of clear treaty law or uniform State conduct, it would be surprising if such indirect legal reasoning was enough to change the application of article 2(4), which the ICJ once called a ‘comerstone’ of the UN Charter.79\nAccordingly, as far as article 2(4) of the UN Charter is concerned, it would appear that the day of Professor D'Amato’s prediction is yet to arrive.\n\n^{}[]"

This article examines that open question. It argues that, whilst the international community has taken some incremental steps towards updating and extending the prohibition to non-violent cyber attacks, those steps have not yet been clear or widespread enough to change that original exclusion from scope.\n## INTRODUCTION\nWhen the *Charter of the United Nations*¹ came into force in 1945, the cyber world was not just yet to be militarised — it did not exist. It should therefore be of no surprise that the *UN Charter* does not include express regulation of cyber tools in military contexts. Yet, today, the advent of modern technology enables States to inflict major damage on one another without exhibiting the traditional hallmarks of conflict. The purpose of this article is therefore to examine whether the use of non-violent cyber attacks is included in the general prohibition on the ‘use of force’ by States in article 2(4) of the *UN Charter*.\nPart II of this article examines the original intent of article 2(4) and determines that cyber attacks were not within its original scope. Part III then contends that article 2(4) is a ‘living instrument’ capable of being given a modern interpretation beyond that of its 1940s origin. Part IV finds it unclear whether customary international law currently prohibits non-violent cyber attacks, which suggests that article 2(4) cannot be given an expansive interpretation to include non-violent cyber attacks. Finally, Part V determines that non-violent cyber attacks are not sufficiently similar to economic blockades, and therefore the same principles of customary international law cannot be extended to non-violent cyber attacks by analogy.\nFor the purposes of this article, ‘non-violent cyber attacks’ shall be taken to be States’ use of cyber-based tools to disrupt or corrupt other States’ computer networks in order to cause non-physical damage, such as widespread social or economic disruption. The reason this article will not focus on cyber attacks that\n---\n* BA/LLB (UNSW) Assistant Director, Australian Government. The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and should not in any way be attributed to the Australian Government.\n¹ *Charter of the United Nations* (‘UN Charter’).\nAUSTRALIAN INTERNATIONAL LAW JOURNAL\ndirectly cause significant physical damage or death (eg cyber attacks that change a vaccine manufacturing process such that the vaccine becomes lethal)² is that their classification as a ‘use of force’, whilst thankfully still theoretical, would likely be uncontroversial under the conventional ‘effects-based’ approach to article 2(4).³\nFinally, whilst it is often remarked that attributing responsibility and causation of cyber attacks can be difficult,⁴ it is worth observing that such practical difficulties do not affect the general theoretical status of cyber attacks under article 2(4). The mere fact that a military action can easily be concealed is of no relevance to whether it is theoretically a use of force — for example, a State’s use of unmarked planes in a clandestine bombing raid is unambiguously still a use of force, despite its hidden nature. Indeed, the legality of an action under article 2(4) can even be determined in the hypothetical,⁵ where there is no attribution (difficult or otherwise) to be had.\n## II THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF ARTICLE 2(4)\nTo answer the question as to whether non-violent cyber attacks can be a ‘use of force’ for the purposes of article 2(4), it must first be determined what the drafters of the UN Charter originally intended by the phrase. To begin with, the full text of article 2(4) in the UN Charter is as follows:\nAll Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.⁶\nUnder the customary rule of treaty interpretation enshrined in article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, the terms of the UN Charter are generally to be interpreted in accordance with their ordinary meaning in light of their context, object, and purpose.⁷ A contextual interpretation suggests that the prohibition of\n2 This example being drawn from Major Graham H Todd, ‘Armed attack in cyberspace: deterring asymmetric warfare with an asymmetric definition’  (Winter) 64 Air Force Law Review 65, 96.\n3 For examples of academic support for such an effects-based approach to cyber attacks, see: United States Department of Defense, *An Assessment of International Legal Issues in Information Operations* (May 1999) (‘US Defense Report 1999’), 18; Major Arie J Schaap ‘Cyber warfare operations: development and use under international law’ (2009) (Winter) 64 Air Force Law Review 121, 147–148, 172, citing Michael N Schmitt, ‘Wired Warfare: Computer Network Attack and Jus in Bello’ (2002) 84 International Review of the Red Cross 365. See also n 70.\n4 Herbert S Lin, ‘Offensive cyber operations and the use of force’ (2010) 4(1) Journal of National Security Law &amp; Policy 63, 77; Matthew C Waxman, ‘Cyber-attacks and the use of force: back to the future of article 2(4)’ (2011) 36(2) The Yale Journal of International Law 421, 443–447; Anna Wortham, ‘Should cyber exploitation ever constitute a demonstration of hostile intent that may violate UN Charter provisions prohibiting the threat or use of force?’ (2012) 64(3) Federal Communications Law Journal 643, 654; US Defense Report 1999 (n 3) 20–21.\n5 As demonstrated by the International Court of Justice’s ability to reach a conclusion regarding article 2(4) of the UN Charter and the use of nuclear weapons in *Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons* (Advisory Opinion)  ICJ Rep 1996 (‘Nuclear Weapons (Advisory Opinion)’), despite the absence of any use of nuclear weapons in conflict since the coming into effect of the UN Charter.\n6 UN Charter art 2(4).\n7 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, opened for signature 23 May 1969, 1155 UNTS 331 (entered into force 27 January 1980) (‘1969 Vienna Convention’) art 31. Whilst article 4 of the 1969 Vienna Convention provides that the 1969 Vienna Convention itself does not apply to the UN Charter (due to the UN Charter pre-dating the 1969 Vienna Convention), the article recognises that the customary international law\nNON-VIOLENT CYBER ATTACKS: A CONTRAVENTION OF ARTICLE 2(4)?\n93\nforce in article 2(4) is restricted to the traditional, kinetic types akin to those available in the WWII era. For instance, the Preamble to the UN Charter states that ‘armed force shall not be used, save in the common interest’⁸ — the term ‘armed’ implying a physical military dimension.⁹ Given that preambulatory statements are often conceptually more general than the articles that effectuate them, the inclusion of cyber attacks in article 2(4) would lead to an internal textual inconsistency in which a preambulatory term is narrower than its operative article. On the presumption that the drafters of the UN Charter did not intend to create such textual inconsistency, this suggests article 2(4) was not meant to include cyber attacks.¹⁰\nFurthermore, article 44 in the UN Charter also implies that ‘use of force’ is simply shorthand for ‘armed force’. Article 44 provides that the United Nations Security Council shall invite certain member States to contribute ‘armed forces … under Article 43’ when the Security Council has resolved to ‘use force’.¹¹ If the phrase ‘use force’ is to include non-armed force like cyber attacks, then a logical inconsistency would arise in which the Security Council can resolve to use non-armed force but is empowered to ask member States to contribute armed force only. Again, on the reasonable presumption that the drafters did not intend such inconsistency, one must conclude that ‘use of force’ (with its close similarity to ‘use force’) refers only to armed force.¹²\nThis confinement to armed force is reinforced when one has reference to the preparatory works of the UN Charter, in accordance with the customary rule enshrined in article 32 of the 1969 Vienna Convention. At the San Francisco Conference in which the UN Charter was drafted, the delegation from Brazil proposed the express insertion of economic measures into article 2(4). This proposal was rejected by twenty-six votes to two, indicating that the drafters consciously did not want to include economic coercion within the scope of ‘use of force’.¹³ Given that economic coercion was essentially the only non-armed means of inter-State antagonism in the 1940s, this reinforces that article 2(4) was originally intended to prohibit armed force only.\nIndeed, at various times during the early stages of the Cold War, member States of the United Nations raised the notion of article 2(4) applying beyond armed force,\nenshrined in the 1969 Vienna Convention can so apply (‘Without prejudice to the application of any rules set forth in the present Convention to which treaties would be subject under international law independently of the Convention …’).\n⁸ UN Charter Preamble (‘… to ensure, by the acceptance of principles and the institution of methods, that armed force shall not be used, save in the common interest…’) (emphasis added).\n⁹ Waxman (n 4) 428; Michael N Schmitt, ‘Computer Network Attack and the Use of Force in International Law: Thoughts on a Normative Framework’ (1999) 37 Columbia Journal of Transnational Law 885, 904.\n¹⁰ Schmitt (n 9) 904.\n¹¹ UN Charter art 44 (‘When the Security Council has decided to use force it shall, before calling upon a Member not represented on it to provide armed forces in fulfilment of the obligations assumed under Article 43, invite that Member, if the Member so desires, to participate in the decisions of the Security Council concerning the employment of contingents of that Member’s armed forces.’).\n¹² Schmitt (n 9) 904.\n¹³ Ibid 905; Michael Gervais, ‘Cyber Attacks and the Laws of War’  (Winter) 1 Journal of Law &lt;= Cyber Warfare 7, 26. For an interpretation to the contrary, see Ido Kilovaty, ‘Rethinking the Prohibition on the Use of Force in the Light of Economic Cyber Warfare: Towards a Broader Scope of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter’ (2015) 4(3) Journal of Law &lt;= Cyber Warfare 210, 230–231.\nAUSTRALIAN INTERNATIONAL LAW JOURNAL\nbut this expansion did not gain sufficient support in academia¹⁴ nor was it reflected in representative State practice.¹⁵ In 1970, international lawyer Thomas Franck even went so far as to declare that article 2(4) had been ‘killed’ due to its non-application (at the time) to the arming of insurgencies in proxy wars,¹⁶ which is an action more akin to traditional armed force than cyber attacks.\nFinally, for completeness, little guidance can be gleaned from the ‘against the territorial integrity or political independence’ qualifier to ‘use of force’ that is found in article 2(4). This is because the preparatory works of the UN Charter make it sufficiently clear that the qualifier is not meant to restrict the meaning of article 2(4).¹⁷ Moreover, the open-endedness of ‘or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations’ extends the scope of article 2(4) to virtually any ‘use of force’ that is not expressly authorised elsewhere in the UN Charter.¹⁸ It is thus clear that article 2(4) was considered — at least originally — to be limited to physical examples of force (indeed, only certain such examples), thus excluding cyber attacks.\n## III IS THE UN CHARTER A ‘LIVING INSTRUMENT’?\nDespite this clarity of original intent, article 2(4) has subsequently been treated as a ‘living instrument’ by two organs of the United Nations itself: the International Court of Justice and the United Nations General Assembly. Whilst neither of these organs has authority to amend the words of the UN Charter,¹⁹ their status within the United Nations accords them particularly authoritative weight in interpreting the UN Charter.²⁰\n14 Quincy Wright, ‘Subversive Intervention’ (1960) 54(3) The American Journal of International Law 521, 529 (‘It is clear that [its provisions] prohibit only the threat or use of armed force or an armed attack. They cannot be construed to include other hostile acts such as propaganda, infiltration or subversion.’), quoted in Waxman (n 4) 430.\n15 Waxman (n 4) 428–430, 449.\n16 Thomas M Franck, ‘Who Killed Article 2(4)? Or: Changing Norms Governing the Use of Force by States’ (1970) 64(4) The American Journal of International Law 809, 812, cited in Waxman (n 4) 441.\n17 James Crawford, *Brownlie’s Principles of Public International Law* (Oxford University Press, 8th ed, 2012) 747, citing Corfu Channel case (Judgment)  ICJ Rep 4, 35.\n18 Schmitt (n 9) 901. Of course, this does not answer what constitutes a ‘use of force’ in the first place.\n19 Amending the UN Charter effectively requires a two-thirds vote of the United Nations General Assembly, followed by ratification by two-thirds of Members (including the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council): UN Charter art 108 and 109.\n20 Under article 7 of the UN Charter, both the International Court of Justice and the General Assembly are ‘principal organs’ of the United Nations. The General Assembly comprises all members of the United Nations (article 9(1) of the UN Charter) and, in accordance with the customary rules of treaty interpretation enshrined in article 31(3)(a) and (b) of the 1969 Vienna Convention, practices or agreement amongst the United Nations members regarding the application of the UN Charter — such as United Nations General Assembly resolutions — can be relevant to the interpretation of the UN Charter. As for the authoritative weight of the International Court of Justice, the UN Charter states the Court to be the ‘principal judicial organ’ of the United Nations and every member to be a party to the Statute of the Court: articles 92 and 93(1) of the UN Charter. The US Department of Defense makes a similar point about the influence of the International Court of Justice and the United Nations General Assembly on customary international law: US Defense Report 1999 (n 3) 1 (‘…certain actions of some international institutions, such as the International Court of Justice and the UN General Assembly, are considered to be persuasive evidence of the existence of principles of customary international law’).\nNON-VIOLENT CYBER ATTACKS: A CONTRAVENTION OF ARTICLE 2(4)?\n95\nIn 1971, the International Court of Justice held that the UN Charter, as an international instrument, can — indeed, must — be:\ninterpreted and applied within the framework of the entire legal system prevailing at the time of the interpretation.²¹\nTherefore, by logical inference, the interpretation of the UN Charter must continuously change as the entire international legal system continuously changes around it.\nMore recently, the United Nations General Assembly has passed multiple Resolutions by considerable majority votes²² with the following preambulatory statement:\n… Confirming the conclusions of the Group of Governmental Experts, in its 2013 and 2015 reports, that international law, and in particular the Charter of the United Nations, is applicable and essential to maintaining peace and stability and promoting an open, secure, stable, accessible and peaceful information and communications technology environment …²³\nTherefore, one can see that the expansive ‘living instrument’ approach towards article 2(4), whilst by no means unanimous, has grounding in international legal discourse — including in the cyber context.²⁴ As a consequence, it may in fact be possible for the general prohibition contained in article 2(4) of the UN Charter to be interpreted to include cyber attacks.\n²¹ Legal Consequences for States of the Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia (South West Africa) notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276 (1970) (Advisory Opinion)  ICJ Rep 16, 31  (emphasis added). Similarly, the International Court of Justice has expansively applied article 31(3)(c) of the 1969 Vienna Convention, which enshines the customary rule of treaty interpretation that ‘any relevant rules of international law applicable in relations between the parties [to the treaty being interpreted]’ are to be taken into account: Oil Platforms (Islamic Republic of Iran v.

This is relevant because, according to the International Court of Justice's above quotation from Namibia (Advisory Opinion), the entire legal system — including customary international law — affects the contemporary interpretation of the term 'use of force' in article 2(4). Accordingly, if the equivalent principles regarding uses of force extend to non-violent cyber attacks under customary international law, then there is good reason to argue that article 2(4) must be given the same expansive interpretation.\nCustomary international law is difficult to delineate precisely, but it can be sourced from international legal discourse. Of particular relevance for this article are three such evidentiary sources: United Nations General Assembly Resolutions, treaty law, and other forms of State practice that signify a legal duty is believed to exist.²⁵\n## A. General Assembly Resolutions\nIn 1974, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Resolution on the Definition of Aggression,²⁶ to which was annexed the 'Definition of Aggression'. As recognised by the International Court of Justice in its 1986 judgment of Nicaragua v United States of America (Merits), the Resolution on the Definition of Aggression represents a significant source of customary international law concerning the use of force.²⁷ The Resolution on the Definition of Aggression was also adopted by consensus,²⁸ which enhances its potential influence on customary international law.²⁹\nWith a preambulatory statement that 'aggression' is the 'most serious and dangerous form of the illegal use of force' (a clear reflection of article 2(4) of the UN Charter), one of the non-exhaustive examples of aggression given in the Definition of Aggression annex to the Resolution on the Definition of Aggression is found in article 3(b) of the annex:\n²⁵ All three sources' relevance to customary international law is cited in Military and Paramilitary Activities In and Against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v.

In particular, the ICRC commentary states that ‘weapon’ is to be construed ‘in the widest sense’ with respect to the way in which it is used, and does not necessarily need to be lethal.³⁴ Thus, by linking the definition of ‘weapon’ contained in article 36 of the 1977 Additional Protocol I to the same word used in the Resolution on the Definition of Aggression, one could conclude that cyber attacks can be a ‘weapon’ of aggression and, therefore, capable of being an illegal use of force under customary international law.³⁵\nHowever, two important caveats must be made to this ‘weapon’ connection. First, the 1977 Additional Protocol I is a treaty concerning jus in bello (legality of conduct during conflict), whereas the Resolution on the Definition of Aggression and article 2(4) of the UN Charter concern jus ad bellum (legality of conflict commencement). As a result, the customary legal principles embodied in each are likely to be different from one another, thereby limiting their mutual applicability.\nSecondly, the existence of the same phrase in two different instruments of law does not necessarily mean that the same meaning is intended across both contexts. As a result, the term ‘weapon’ in the 1977 Additional Protocol I could well be denoting\n30 Resolution on the Definition of Aggression (n 26) annex Preamble (‘... Considering also that, since aggression is the most serious and dangerous form of the illegal use of force ...’ (emphasis original)), art 3(b) (emphasis added).\n31 Todd makes a similar argument in relation to ‘armed attack’ under article 51 of the UN Charter.

Indeed, Blake and Imburgia do not limit this conclusion to customary international law, but directly apply it by ipso facto reasoning to article 2(4) of the UN Charter.</https:>\nAUSTRALIAN INTERNATIONAL LAW JOURNAL\nsomething different to what is intended to be a ‘weapon’ under the Resolution on the Definition of Aggression.³⁶\nDue to these caveats to the application of the Resolution on the Definition of Aggression to non-violent cyber attacks, it is necessary to consider other sources of customary international law for greater clarity.\n## B. Treaty law\nThe second possible source of the illegality of cyber attacks comes from treaty law, which can both influence and codify principles of customary international law.³⁷ One treaty that is of incidental relevance to cyber warfare is the Constitution and Convention of the International Telecommunication Union.³⁸ Most relevantly, article 45 of the ITU Convention prohibits ‘harmful interference’ of radio services and communications of other members of the International Telecommunication Union. ‘Harmful interference’ is defined in the annex to the ITU Convention as:\nInterference which endangers the functioning of a radionavigation service or of other safety services or seriously degrades, obstructs or repeatedly interrupts a radio communication service . . .³⁹\nDespite containing no reference to ‘use of force’, article 45 of the ITU Convention is relevant in that it prohibits the blocking of telecommunication devices — a common effect of cyber attacks. Moreover, it is a treaty considered to apply primarily during peacetime,⁴⁰ which is when the jus ad bellum parameters of article 2(4) of the UN Charter are relevant. As such, with its near-unanimous adoption,⁴¹ the ITU Convention represents at least a minor indication that non-violent cyber attacks are capable of contravening customary international law regarding the use of force, and thus potentially article 2(4) of the UN Charter as well.\nConversely, the Convention Respecting the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers and Persons in Case of War on Land 1907⁴² is a treaty that could be shaping customary international law against a prohibition of non-violent cyber attacks. Under article 8 of the 1907 Neutrality Convention, a State’s neutrality is not violated by belligerents’ use of the State’s ‘telegraphy or telephone cables or … wireless telegraphy apparatus’.⁴³ By contrast, the Resolution on the Definition of Aggression includes a State ‘allowing its territory… to be used by [another] State for perpetrating an act of\n³⁶ Ibid 189.\n³⁷ Nicaragua (Merits) (n 25) 94–95 (177).\n³⁸ Constitution and Convention of the International Telecommunication Union, concluded 22 December 1992, 1825, 1826 UNTS (entered into force 1 July 1994) (‘ITU Constitution’ and ‘ITU Convention’).

Thus, this suggests that cyber attacks are not a use of force under customary international law.45\nHaving said this, though, it is worth noting that the 1907 Neutrality Convention is of considerable age and thus is less likely to reflect today's customary international law, especially in the fast-changing realm of technology. In addition, there is nothing in the 1907 Neutrality Convention to suggest that it applies to the many types of modern technological systems that generate electronic information (such as satellite imagery and navigation systems), rather than just to those that simply relay communications ('telegraphy').46 Thus, the indication in the 1907 Neutrality Convention that cyber attacks are not a use of force should be considered relevant to the slightest degree only.\nAccordingly, treaty law does not provide strong or consistent guidance either.\n## C. Other State practice\nThe third evidentiary source of customary international law that could signify the status of cyber attacks is the individual conduct of the States themselves (as opposed to the collective acts of passing General Assembly resolutions and entering treaties). This is a well-recognised notion in which the conduct — both proactive and passive — and statements of member States can, if widespread and consistent enough, develop and reflect customary international law.47\nGiven that customary international law is most readily interpreted from the actions of States whose interests are specially affected,48 three member States whose approaches to cyber attacks are likely particularly relevant are the People's Republic of China (as the State with the most Internet users),49 the United States of America (as the most populous State with over 90% of the population using the Internet),50\n44 Resolution on the Definition of Aggression (n 26) annex art 3(f) ('Any of the following acts, regardless of a declaration of war, shall, subject to and in accordance with the provisions of article 2, qualify as an act of aggression... The action of a State in allowing its territory, which it has placed at the disposal of another State, to be used by that other State for perpetrating an act of aggression against a third State').\n45 A similar conclusion is reached in Blake and Imburgia (n 28) 186–187 about the 1907 Neutrality Convention without reference to the Resolution on the Definition of Aggression.\n46 US Defense Report 1999 (n 3) 10.\n47 North Sea Continental Shelf (Federal Republic of Germany v Denmark; Federal Republic of Germany v Netherlands) (Judgment)  ICJ Rep 3 ('North Sea Continental Shelf'), 28–29 , 44 ; Nicaragua (Merits) (n 25) 98–100 –; Continental Shelf (Libyan Arab Jarnabiriya/Malta) (Judgment)  ICJ Rep 13, 29–30 ; Wood (n 25) 22–31 –.\n48 North Sea Continental Shelf (n 47) 41–42 –, partially cited in Scott J Shackelford, 'From nuclear war to net war: analogizing cyber attacks in international law' (2009) 27(1) Berkeley Journal of International Law 192, 218 and in ILC Draft Conclusions (n 23), 136–137.\n49 For a comparison of the total number of Internet users in different States in 2020, see Central Intelligence Agency, Field Listing — Internet Users (2022) <https: internet-users=\"\" file=\"\" file.=\"\" file.indd=\"\" www.cia.gov=\"\"></https:>. This estimates that there were 987 million Internet users in the People's Republic of China in 2020.\n50 The World Bank estimates that 90.9% of individuals in the United States of America were using the Internet in 2020, considerably higher than the percentages in the only two more populous States (70%\nAUSTRALIAN INTERNATIONAL LAW JOURNAL\nand the Republic of Estonia (as a pioneer of online government services). As such, their governments' public positions and actions would be particularly indicative.\nIn the case of the People's Republic of China, in 1999 the PLA Daily (the official media outlet for the State's army) publicly stated that 'internet warfare is of equal significance to land, sea and air power and requires its own military branch'. Subsequently, in 2006, the State's defence White Paper stated that the army had the strategic goal of 'building informationized armed forces and being capable of winning informationized wars by the mid-21st century'. Thus it seems the case that the People's Republic of China also views cyber attacks, like conventional military attacks, as having the potential to constitute a use of force.\nAs for the United States of America, in May 2012 the US Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta stated in an interview that the USA viewed a 'crippling' cyber attack as an 'act of war'. More recently, in 2018, the United States Cyber Command stated that its strategy in relation to the 'warfighting domain' of cyberspace is to:\n... invest in cyber defense, resilience, and the continued integration of cyber capabilities into the full spectrum of military operations...[to] enable us to provide attribution while defending against and holding accountable state or non-state actors during cyberattacks ...\nAs a result, the position of the USA appears also to be that cyber attacks can readily constitute a use of force under article 2(4) of the UN Charter.\nFinally, the Republic of Estonia represents a highly-connected State with the rare distinction of having suffered a significant non-violent cyber attack during peacetime, when 'denial-of-service' attacks over several days in 2007 shut down the country's online bank networks, media outlets, safety services, and government communication systems.

The Estonian Government even raised the prospect of invoking the collective self-defence mechanism of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (‘NATO’) in response to the cyber attacks.⁶¹ It is therefore clear from the Estonian Government’s actions that it, too, considers cyber attacks to be capable of constituting a use of force.\nIndeed, NATO — of which the USA and the Republic of Estonia are members⁶² — has itself made postures indicating that, as a collective regional organisation, it views cyber attacks as potentially constituting a use of force under article 2(4) of the UN Charter. In 2014, in its Wales Summit Declaration, NATO declared that:\n… international law, including international humanitarian law and the UN Charter, applies in cyberspace …. A decision as to when a cyber attack would lead to the invocation of Article 5 [of the North Atlantic Treaty] would be taken by the North Atlantic Council on a case-by-case basis.⁶³\nWhat is particularly pertinent here is that article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, which the Republic of Estonia sought to invoke in 2007, mirrors and expressly cites article 51 of the UN Charter.⁶⁴ Article 51 of the UN Charter is enlivened if one State commits an ‘armed attack’ against another State, and ‘armed attack’ is widely interpreted to mean more egregious uses of force than those contemplated in article 2(4) of the UN Charter.⁶⁵ In other words, by definition, any action that is an armed attack in article 51 must also be a use of force in article 2(4).\nAs such, the fact that NATO has publicly declared that the question is ‘when’ (not ‘if’) a cyber attack can enliven article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty is very strong evidence that the member States of NATO — all 30 of whom are also members of\n⁵⁸ Hinkle (n 56) 13.\n⁵⁹ Shackelford (n 48) 194.\n⁶⁰ NATO and Cyber Defence 2009 (n 53) 6 , 12 .\n⁶¹ Shackelford (n 48) 193; Schaap (n 3) 144; NATO and Cyber Defence 2009 (n 53) 12 –.\n⁶² North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Member countries (Webpage, 24 September 2020) <https: en=\"\" ntolive=\"\" nanolive=\"\" topics_52044.htm=\"\" topics_52044.html=\"\" www.nato.int=\"\"> (‘NATO Member Webpage’).\n⁶³ NATO, Wales Summit Declaration, 5 September 2014, 72, cited in Gray (n 29) 35.

This is because the building up of offensive cyber capabilities in a State’s military can also be construed as an implicit stance that cyber attacks do not contravene article 2(4) of the UN Charter. Not only would one presume that a State would publicly invest only in military technologies that the State considers legal, but there is also the international law doctrine of *tu quoque* — that is, a State has no standing to claim a practice is illegal when the State is itself engaged in that practice.⁶⁷\nFurthermore, with the exception of the Estonian Government’s reaction to the cyber attacks in 2007, the States’ behaviour cited above does not make clear if their stances cover non-violent cyber attacks, violent cyber attacks, or both. It is similarly unclear from the above People’s Republic of China defence White Paper and the United States Cyber Command defence strategy whether those States were speaking with the threshold of article 2(4) in mind or rather some lower legal threshold concerning State relations, such as the prohibition against coercive intervention in another State’s internal affairs.⁶⁸\nAs a result, whilst individual State practice does lend some support to there being a prohibition under customary international law against non-violent cyber attacks, the development of such a prohibition remains ambiguous.⁶⁹\n## D. Conclusion as to customary international law\nConsequently, it is unclear whether customary international law does prohibit non-violent cyber attacks as an unlawful use of force. In each of the three evidentiary sources of United Nations General Assembly Resolutions, treaty law, and other State practice, there are either caveats or contradictory indications. Given this inconclusive evidence, the final step in this article’s analysis is to determine whether non-violent cyber attacks should be considered a ‘use of force’ under customary international law by reason of analogy.\n66 NATO Member Webpage (n 62); United Nations, *Member States* (Webpage) <https: about-us=\"\" member-states=\"\" www.un.org=\"\">.\n67 US Defense Report 1999 (n 3) 46, speaking in the context of peacetime espionage.\n68 That coercive intervention is a lower legal threshold than use of force is made clear in Michael N. Schmitt (ed) *Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations* (Cambridge University Press, 2017) (‘Tallin 2.0’), 275 , 319,  323,  and in *Nicaragua (Morris)* (n 25) 119 , the latter cited in Gray (n 29) 36.\n69 After analysing the stances of several States, Gray concludes ‘It is apparent that the question of the application of the Charter scheme to cyber warfare is still at a very early stage. There is not yet any obvious mechanism for resolving the legal questions.’: Gray (n 29) 34–35.</https:>\nNON-VIOLENT CYBER ATTACKS: A CONTRAVENTION OF ARTICLE 2(4)?\n103\n# V ARE NON-VIOLENT CYBER ATTACKS ANALOGOUS TO ECONOMIC BLOCKADES?\nSince the shift in international legal discourse towards the 'living instrument' approach, it has become the accepted practice in international law to classify potential uses of force not on the basis of their mechanisms but on the effects directly caused.70 As a result, if the effects of non-violent cyber attacks can be shown to be comparable to the effects of other behaviour that is generally accepted to be a use of force, then one can legitimately conclude that these cyber attacks should also be considered a use of force under customary international law (and thus, potentially, under article 2(4) of the UN Charter).71\nOne particularly illustrative comparison is that of economic blockades, which are unilateral acts that interfere with trade between the victim State and all other parties (whether the other parties are willing and unwilling).72 Blockades are typically imposed through the presence of armed forces,73 and are considered an act of aggression (and thus an illegal use of force) under customary international law.74 For this reason, this article shall now compare the most egregious examples of non-violent cyber warfare to an economic blockade.\n## A. Similarity\nThe typical effects of a blockade on a victim State build gradually, and rarely involve immediate physical damage or human death. Instead, lack of access to materials and services in which the victim State previously traded (assuming it is not an economically-isolated State) typically leads to a slow degradation of production and economy. For example, if the victim State previously imported spare parts for its machinery, then its machines will continue to function as normal at the beginning of the blockade but eventually cease to function as the blockade continues, due to lack of spare parts.75 Thus, although the blockade has not directly inflicted any physical damage, over time it does so indirectly.\nIn these respects, non-violent cyber attacks can certainly create the same (indeed, even more pronounced) effects as an economic blockade. First, non-violent\n70 Resolution on the Definition of Aggression (n 26) annex art 2, cited in Todd (n 2) 76, 78 and in Blake and Imburgia (n 28) 188; Lin (n 4) 73; Nicaragua (Merits) (n 25) 103  ('... the prohibition of armed attacks may apply to the sending by a State of armed bands to the territory of another State, if such an operation, because of its scale and effects, would have been classified as an armed attack rather than as a mere frontier incident had it been carried out by regular armed forces ...' (emphasis added)).\n71 See also Tallinn 2.0 (n 68) 331 ('A cyber operation constitutes a use of force when its scale and effects are comparable to non-cyber operations rising to the level of a use of force') in relation to cyber attacks in general, the prior version of which is cited in Gray (n 29) 34.\n72 Lin (n 4) 80.\n73 As recognised in article 42 of the UN Charter, which describes a blockade as an example of 'action by air, sea, or land forces'.\n74 Lin (n 4) 81–82. Resolution on the Definition of Aggression (n 26) annex art 3(c) specifically lists blockading a port or coast as an act of aggression ('The blockade of the ports or coasts of a State by the armed forces of another State'). Indeed, articles 41 and 42 of the UN Charter imply that blockades are a use of force, by referring to blockades as an example of 'action by air, sea, or land forces' that is available for the Security Council to take if 'measures not involving the use of armed force' are inadequate.\n75 Lin (n 4) 81–82.\nAUSTRALIAN INTERNATIONAL LAW JOURNAL\ncyber attacks can clandestinely change a machine manufacturing process within a victim State such that the resulting products pass initial testing but then become physically unreliable a short time afterwards.76 This would not only damage the victim State's export trade but, if the victim State also creates machines for its own use, lead to a gradual decline in its local equipment as well. Thus, the effects are almost identical to a blockade — disrupted trade relationships and gradual physical damage. Moreover, if the victim State cannot detect or nullify the cyber attack due to its clandestine nature, the victim State has even less ability to avoid its deleterious effects as the State would in an economic blockade.\nSecondly, non-violent cyber attacks have the ability of cutting off a victim State from all computerised trade. For example, a victim State's stock exchange system or banking systems could be repeatedly overloaded or disabled, resulting in any computerised market transactions becoming impossible.77 Like with a traditional economic blockade, the victim State thus has its trade with all its partners prevented by the unilateral actions of an aggressor. Indeed, this type of cyber attack has an even stronger effect than a traditional blockade, in that the cyber attack is preventing trade within the victim State as well as interstate trade.\n## B. Differences\nHowever, an important feature of economic blockades that is not found in non-violent cyber attacks is the distinct possibility of direct physical damage and human death. Unlike in cyber blockades, where access is blocked electronically and the victim State can — and usually has to — defend itself electronically, traditional economic blockades involve physical constraints and physical military threats. As such, for a victim State to end an economic blockade, the State must itself resort to armed force that will cause physical damage and likely human death.\nFurthermore, the instigator of a traditional economic blockade typically will be enforcing it with military assets that could, if the instigator desired, also directly cause physical damage and death against the victim State.\nIn other words, traditional economic blockades are a much stronger precursor to armed conflicts than non-violent cyber attacks, which may justify why they are more widely considered to be contraventions of customary international law than cyber attacks.\n## C. Conclusion as to economic blockade analogy\nIn consequence, using an effects-based analogy with economic blockades, one can argue only with moderate justification that non-violent cyber attacks should be considered a use of force under customary international law and article 2(4) of the UN Charter.\n76 Ibid 75.\n77 Ibid 74.\nNON-VIOLENT CYBER ATTACKS: A CONTRAVENTION OF ARTICLE 2(4)?\n105\n# VI CONCLUSION\nIn 1999, legal scholar Anthony D'Amato predicted that ‘attacks on the Internet will soon be seen as clearly illegal under international law’.78 Yet, despite this prediction and the continued willingness of member States and legal scholars in recent decades towards expanding the ambit of the UN Charter, there has been little corresponding agreement as to whether non-violent cyber-based attacks can come under the prohibition in article 2(4).\nIn the area of customary international law, the answer remains mostly ambiguous. The public statements of some States suggest that they believe non-violent cyber attacks can contravene article 2(4), yet those States’ practice indicates otherwise. Similarly, treaty law and General Assembly Resolutions provide only incidental — or conflicting — jurisprudence on cyber warfare’s relationship with article 2(4).\nPerhaps the strongest argument in favour of non-violent cyber attacks being capable of being a ‘use of force’ under article 2(4) is the analogy between non-violent cyber attacks and economic blockades, given their respective effects can be so similar. However, in the absence of clear treaty law or uniform State conduct, it would be surprising if such indirect legal reasoning was enough to change the application of article 2(4), which the ICJ once called a ‘comerstone’ of the UN Charter.79\nAccordingly, as far as article 2(4) of the UN Charter is concerned, it would appear that the day of Professor D'Amato’s prediction is yet to arrive.\n78 Anthony D'Amato, ‘International Law, Cybernetics, and Cyberspace’ (1999) 76 International Law Studies 59, cited in Waxman (n 4) 425.\n79 Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo (Democratic Republic of the Congo v.

This article examines that open question. It argues that, whilst the international community has taken some incremental steps towards updating and extending the prohibition to non-violent cyber attacks, those steps have not yet been clear or widespread enough to change that original exclusion from scope.\n## INTRODUCTION When the *Charter of the United Nations*¹ came into force in 1945, the cyber world was not just yet to be militarised — it did not exist. It should therefore be of no surprise that the *UN Charter* does not include express regulation of cyber tools in military contexts. Yet, today, the advent of modern technology enables States to inflict major damage on one another without exhibiting the traditional hallmarks of conflict. The purpose of this article is therefore to examine whether the use of non-violent cyber attacks is included in the general prohibition on the ‘use of force’ by States in article 2(4) of the *UN Charter*.\nPart II of this article examines the original intent of article 2(4) and determines that cyber attacks were not within its original scope. Part III then contends that article 2(4) is a ‘living instrument’ capable of being given a modern interpretation beyond that of its 1940s origin. Part IV finds it unclear whether customary international law currently prohibits non-violent cyber attacks, which suggests that article 2(4) cannot be given an expansive interpretation to include non-violent cyber attacks. Finally, Part V determines that non-violent cyber attacks are not sufficiently similar to economic blockades, and therefore the same principles of customary international law cannot be extended to non-violent cyber attacks by analogy.\nFor the purposes of this article, ‘non-violent cyber attacks’ shall be taken to be States’ use of cyber-based tools to disrupt or corrupt other States’ computer networks in order to cause non-physical damage, such as widespread social or economic disruption. The reason this article will not focus on cyber attacks that --- * BA/LLB (UNSW) Assistant Director, Australian Government.

The mere fact that a military action can easily be concealed is of no relevance to whether it is theoretically a use of force — for example, a State’s use of unmarked planes in a clandestine bombing raid is unambiguously still a use of force, despite its hidden nature. Indeed, the legality of an action under article 2(4) can even be determined in the hypothetical,⁵ where there is no attribution (difficult or otherwise) to be had.\n## II THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF ARTICLE 2(4) To answer the question as to whether non-violent cyber attacks can be a ‘use of force’ for the purposes of article 2(4), it must first be determined what the drafters of the UN Charter originally intended by the phrase. To begin with, the full text of article 2(4) in the UN Charter is as follows: All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.⁶ Under the customary rule of treaty interpretation enshrined in article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, the terms of the UN Charter are generally to be interpreted in accordance with their ordinary meaning in light of their context, object, and purpose.⁷ A contextual interpretation suggests that the prohibition of NON-VIOLENT CYBER ATTACKS: A CONTRAVENTION OF ARTICLE 2(4)?\n\nFurthermore, article 44 in the UN Charter also implies that ‘use of force’ is simply shorthand for ‘armed force’. Article 44 provides that the United Nations Security Council shall invite certain member States to contribute ‘armed forces … under Article 43’ when the Security Council has resolved to ‘use force’.¹¹ If the phrase ‘use force’ is to include non-armed force like cyber attacks, then a logical inconsistency would arise in which the Security Council can resolve to use non-armed force but is empowered to ask member States to contribute armed force only. Again, on the reasonable presumption that the drafters did not intend such inconsistency, one must conclude that ‘use of force’ (with its close similarity to ‘use force’) refers only to armed force.¹² This confinement to armed force is reinforced when one has reference to the preparatory works of the UN Charter, in accordance with the customary rule enshrined in article 32 of the 1969 Vienna Convention. At the San Francisco Conference in which the UN Charter was drafted, the delegation from Brazil proposed the express insertion of economic measures into article 2(4). This proposal was rejected by twenty-six votes to two, indicating that the drafters consciously did not want to include economic coercion within the scope of ‘use of force’.¹³ Given that economic coercion was essentially the only non-armed means of inter-State antagonism in the 1940s, this reinforces that article 2(4) was originally intended to prohibit armed force only.\nIndeed, at various times during the early stages of the Cold War, member States of the United Nations raised the notion of article 2(4) applying beyond armed force, enshrined in the 1969 Vienna Convention can so apply (‘Without prejudice to the application of any rules set forth in the present Convention to which treaties would be subject under international law independently of the Convention …’).\n⁸ UN Charter Preamble (‘… to ensure, by the acceptance of principles and the institution of methods, that armed force shall not be used, save in the common interest…’) (emphasis added).\n⁹ Waxman (n 4) 428; Michael N Schmitt, ‘Computer Network Attack and the Use of Force in International Law: Thoughts on a Normative Framework’ (1999) 37 Columbia Journal of Transnational Law 885, 904.\n¹⁰ Schmitt (n 9) 904.\n¹¹ UN Charter art 44 (‘When the Security Council has decided to use force it shall, before calling upon a Member not represented on it to provide armed forces in fulfilment of the obligations assumed under Article 43, invite that Member, if the Member so desires, to participate in the decisions of the Security Council concerning the employment of contingents of that Member’s armed forces.’).\n¹² Schmitt (n 9) 904.\n¹³ Ibid 905; Michael Gervais, ‘Cyber Attacks and the Laws of War’ [2012] (Winter) 1 Journal of Law &lt;= Cyber Warfare 7, 26. For an interpretation to the contrary, see Ido Kilovaty, ‘Rethinking the Prohibition on the Use of Force in the Light of Economic Cyber Warfare: Towards a Broader Scope of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter’ (2015) 4(3) Journal of Law &lt;= Cyber Warfare 210, 230–231.\nAUSTRALIAN INTERNATIONAL LAW JOURNAL but this expansion did not gain sufficient support in academia¹⁴ nor was it reflected in representative State practice.¹⁵ In 1970, international lawyer Thomas Franck even went so far as to declare that article 2(4) had been ‘killed’ due to its non-application (at the time) to the arming of insurgencies in proxy wars,¹⁶ which is an action more akin to traditional armed force than cyber attacks.\nFinally, for completeness, little guidance can be gleaned from the ‘against the territorial integrity or political independence’ qualifier to ‘use of force’ that is found in article 2(4). This is because the preparatory works of the UN Charter make it sufficiently clear that the qualifier is not meant to restrict the meaning of article 2(4).¹⁷ Moreover, the open-endedness of ‘or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations’ extends the scope of article 2(4) to virtually any ‘use of force’ that is not expressly authorised elsewhere in the UN Charter.¹⁸ It is thus clear that article 2(4) was considered — at least originally — to be limited to physical examples of force (indeed, only certain such examples), thus excluding cyber attacks.\n## III IS THE UN CHARTER A ‘LIVING INSTRUMENT’?\nDespite this clarity of original intent, article 2(4) has subsequently been treated as a ‘living instrument’ by two organs of the United Nations itself: the International Court of Justice and the United Nations General Assembly. Whilst neither of these organs has authority to amend the words of the UN Charter,¹⁹ their status within the United Nations accords them particularly authoritative weight in interpreting the UN Charter.²⁰ NON-VIOLENT CYBER ATTACKS: A CONTRAVENTION OF ARTICLE 2(4)?\n\ninterpreted and applied within the framework of the entire legal system prevailing at the time of the interpretation.²¹ Therefore, by logical inference, the interpretation of the UN Charter must continuously change as the entire international legal system continuously changes around it.\nMore recently, the United Nations General Assembly has passed multiple Resolutions by considerable majority votes²² with the following preambulatory statement: … Confirming the conclusions of the Group of Governmental Experts, in its 2013 and 2015 reports, that international law, and in particular the Charter of the United Nations, is applicable and essential to maintaining peace and stability and promoting an open, secure, stable, accessible and peaceful information and communications technology environment …²³ Therefore, one can see that the expansive ‘living instrument’ approach towards article 2(4), whilst by no means unanimous, has grounding in international legal discourse — including in the cyber context.²⁴ As a consequence, it may in fact be possible for the general prohibition contained in article 2(4) of the UN Charter to be interpreted to include cyber attacks.\n²¹ Legal Consequences for States of the Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia (South West Africa) notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276 (1970) (Advisory Opinion) [1971] ICJ Rep 16, 31 [53] (emphasis added). Similarly, the International Court of Justice has expansively applied article 31(3)(c) of the 1969 Vienna Convention, which enshines the customary rule of treaty interpretation that ‘any relevant rules of international law applicable in relations between the parties [to the treaty being interpreted]’ are to be taken into account: Oil Platforms (Islamic Republic of Iran v.

This is relevant because, according to the International Court of Justice's above quotation from Namibia (Advisory Opinion), the entire legal system — including customary international law — affects the contemporary interpretation of the term 'use of force' in article 2(4). Accordingly, if the equivalent principles regarding uses of force extend to non-violent cyber attacks under customary international law, then there is good reason to argue that article 2(4) must be given the same expansive interpretation.\nCustomary international law is difficult to delineate precisely, but it can be sourced from international legal discourse. Of particular relevance for this article are three such evidentiary sources: United Nations General Assembly Resolutions, treaty law, and other forms of State practice that signify a legal duty is believed to exist.²⁵ ## A. General Assembly Resolutions In 1974, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Resolution on the Definition of Aggression,²⁶ to which was annexed the 'Definition of Aggression'. As recognised by the International Court of Justice in its 1986 judgment of Nicaragua v United States of America (Merits), the Resolution on the Definition of Aggression represents a significant source of customary international law concerning the use of force.²⁷ The Resolution on the Definition of Aggression was also adopted by consensus,²⁸ which enhances its potential influence on customary international law.²⁹ With a preambulatory statement that 'aggression' is the 'most serious and dangerous form of the illegal use of force' (a clear reflection of article 2(4) of the UN Charter), one of the non-exhaustive examples of aggression given in the Definition of Aggression annex to the Resolution on the Definition of Aggression is found in article 3(b) of the annex: ²⁵ All three sources' relevance to customary international law is cited in Military and Paramilitary Activities In and Against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States of America) (Merits) [1986] ICJ Rep 1986 ('Nicaragua (Merits)'), 99–100 [188].

In particular, the ICRC commentary states that ‘weapon’ is to be construed ‘in the widest sense’ with respect to the way in which it is used, and does not necessarily need to be lethal.³⁴ Thus, by linking the definition of ‘weapon’ contained in article 36 of the 1977 Additional Protocol I to the same word used in the Resolution on the Definition of Aggression, one could conclude that cyber attacks can be a ‘weapon’ of aggression and, therefore, capable of being an illegal use of force under customary international law.³⁵ However, two important caveats must be made to this ‘weapon’ connection. First, the 1977 Additional Protocol I is a treaty concerning jus in bello (legality of conduct during conflict), whereas the Resolution on the Definition of Aggression and article 2(4) of the UN Charter concern jus ad bellum (legality of conflict commencement). As a result, the customary legal principles embodied in each are likely to be different from one another, thereby limiting their mutual applicability.\nSecondly, the existence of the same phrase in two different instruments of law does not necessarily mean that the same meaning is intended across both contexts. As a result, the term ‘weapon’ in the 1977 Additional Protocol I could well be denoting AUSTRALIAN INTERNATIONAL LAW JOURNAL something different to what is intended to be a ‘weapon’ under the Resolution on the Definition of Aggression.³⁶ Due to these caveats to the application of the Resolution on the Definition of Aggression to non-violent cyber attacks, it is necessary to consider other sources of customary international law for greater clarity.\n## B. Treaty law The second possible source of the illegality of cyber attacks comes from treaty law, which can both influence and codify principles of customary international law.³⁷ One treaty that is of incidental relevance to cyber warfare is the Constitution and Convention of the International Telecommunication Union.³⁸ Most relevantly, article 45 of the ITU Convention prohibits ‘harmful interference’ of radio services and communications of other members of the International Telecommunication Union. ‘Harmful interference’ is defined in the annex to the ITU Convention as: Interference which endangers the functioning of a radionavigation service or of other safety services or seriously degrades, obstructs or repeatedly interrupts a radio communication service...³⁹ Despite containing no reference to ‘use of force’, article 45 of the ITU Convention is relevant in that it prohibits the blocking of telecommunication devices — a common effect of cyber attacks. Moreover, it is a treaty considered to apply primarily during peacetime,⁴⁰ which is when the jus ad bellum parameters of article 2(4) of the UN Charter are relevant. As such, with its near-unanimous adoption,⁴¹ the ITU Convention represents at least a minor indication that non-violent cyber attacks are capable of contravening customary international law regarding the use of force, and thus potentially article 2(4) of the UN Charter as well.\nConversely, the Convention Respecting the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers and Persons in Case of War on Land 1907⁴² is a treaty that could be shaping customary international law against a prohibition of non-violent cyber attacks. Under article 8 of the 1907 Neutrality Convention, a State’s neutrality is not violated by belligerents’ use of the State’s ‘telegraphy or telephone cables or … wireless telegraphy apparatus’.⁴³ By contrast, the Resolution on the Definition of Aggression includes a State ‘allowing its territory… to be used by [another] State for perpetrating an act of ³⁶ Ibid 189.\n³⁷ Nicaragua (Merits) (n 25) 94–95 (177).\n³⁸ Constitution and Convention of the International Telecommunication Union, concluded 22 December 1992, 1825, 1826 UNTS (entered into force 1 July 1994) (‘ITU Constitution’ and ‘ITU Convention’).

In addition, there is nothing in the 1907 Neutrality Convention to suggest that it applies to the many types of modern technological systems that generate electronic information (such as satellite imagery and navigation systems), rather than just to those that simply relay communications ('telegraphy').46 Thus, the indication in the 1907 Neutrality Convention that cyber attacks are not a use of force should be considered relevant to the slightest degree only.\nAccordingly, treaty law does not provide strong or consistent guidance either.\n## C. Other State practice The third evidentiary source of customary international law that could signify the status of cyber attacks is the individual conduct of the States themselves (as opposed to the collective acts of passing General Assembly resolutions and entering treaties). This is a well-recognised notion in which the conduct — both proactive and passive — and statements of member States can, if widespread and consistent enough, develop and reflect customary international law.47 Given that customary international law is most readily interpreted from the actions of States whose interests are specially affected,48 three member States whose approaches to cyber attacks are likely particularly relevant are the People's Republic of China (as the State with the most Internet users),49 the United States of America (as the most populous State with over 90% of the population using the Internet),50 AUSTRALIAN INTERNATIONAL LAW JOURNAL and the Republic of Estonia (as a pioneer of online government services).[51] As such, their governments' public positions and actions would be particularly indicative.\nIn the case of the People's Republic of China, in 1999 the PLA Daily (the official media outlet for the State's army) publicly stated that 'internet warfare is of equal significance to land, sea and air power and requires its own military branch'.[52] Subsequently, in 2006, the State's defence White Paper stated that the army had the strategic goal of 'building informationized armed forces and being capable of winning informationized wars by the mid-21st century'.[53] Thus it seems the case that the People's Republic of China also views cyber attacks, like conventional military attacks, as having the potential to constitute a use of force.\nAs for the United States of America, in May 2012 the US Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta stated in an interview that the USA viewed a 'crippling' cyber attack as an 'act of war'.[54] More recently, in 2018, the United States Cyber Command stated that its strategy in relation to the 'warfighting domain' of cyberspace is to:... invest in cyber defense, resilience, and the continued integration of cyber capabilities into the full spectrum of military operations...[to] enable us to provide attribution while defending against and holding accountable state or non-state actors during cyberattacks...[55] As a result, the position of the USA appears also to be that cyber attacks can readily constitute a use of force under article 2(4) of the UN Charter.\nFinally, the Republic of Estonia represents a highly-connected State with the rare distinction of having suffered a significant non-violent cyber attack during peacetime, when 'denial-of-service' attacks over several days in 2007 shut down the country's online bank networks, media outlets, safety services, and government communication systems.[56] In the aftermath of the attack, which was estimated to have caused tens of millions of euros' worth in economic losses[57] but no physical or in the People's Republic of China and 43% in the Republic of India): The World Bank, Individuals using the Internet (% of population) (2022) <https: int.net.userzs=\"\"indicator=\"\"data.worldbank.org=\"\">.\n\nNON-VIOLENT CYBER ATTACKS: A CONTRAVENTION OF ARTICLE 2(4)? 101 long-term economic damage,⁵⁸ the Speaker of the Estonian Parliament equated it with a nuclear explosion⁵⁹ and the Estonian Defense Minister stated that cyber war represents the equivalent threat to the blockading of a country’s ports two hundred years ago⁶⁰ (a blockade being a use of force under current international law — see Part IV below of this article). The Estonian Government even raised the prospect of invoking the collective self-defence mechanism of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (‘NATO’) in response to the cyber attacks.⁶¹ It is therefore clear from the Estonian Government’s actions that it, too, considers cyber attacks to be capable of constituting a use of force.\nIndeed, NATO — of which the USA and the Republic of Estonia are members⁶² — has itself made postures indicating that, as a collective regional organisation, it views cyber attacks as potentially constituting a use of force under article 2(4) of the UN Charter. In 2014, in its Wales Summit Declaration, NATO declared that: … international law, including international humanitarian law and the UN Charter, applies in cyberspace …. A decision as to when a cyber attack would lead to the invocation of Article 5 [of the North Atlantic Treaty] would be taken by the North Atlantic Council on a case-by-case basis.⁶³ What is particularly pertinent here is that article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, which the Republic of Estonia sought to invoke in 2007, mirrors and expressly cites article 51 of the UN Charter.⁶⁴ Article 51 of the UN Charter is enlivened if one State commits an ‘armed attack’ against another State, and ‘armed attack’ is widely interpreted to mean more egregious uses of force than those contemplated in article 2(4) of the UN Charter.⁶⁵ In other words, by definition, any action that is an armed attack in article 51 must also be a use of force in article 2(4).\nAs such, the fact that NATO has publicly declared that the question is ‘when’ (not ‘if’) a cyber attack can enliven article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty is very strong evidence that the member States of NATO — all 30 of whom are also members of ⁵⁸ Hinkle (n 56) 13.\n⁵⁹ Shackelford (n 48) 194.\n⁶⁰ NATO and Cyber Defence 2009 (n 53) 6 [25], 12 [59].\n⁶¹ Shackelford (n 48) 193; Schaap (n 3) 144; NATO and Cyber Defence 2009 (n 53) 12 [58]–[59].\n⁶² North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Member countries (Webpage, 24 September 2020) <https: en=\"\"ntolive=\"\"nanolive=\"\"topics_52044.htm=\"\"topics_52044.html=\"\"www.nato.int=\"\"> (‘NATO Member Webpage’).\n⁶³ NATO, Wales Summit Declaration, 5 September 2014, 72, cited in Gray (n 29) 35.

This is because the building up of offensive cyber capabilities in a State’s military can also be construed as an implicit stance that cyber attacks do not contravene article 2(4) of the UN Charter. Not only would one presume that a State would publicly invest only in military technologies that the State considers legal, but there is also the international law doctrine of *tu quoque* — that is, a State has no standing to claim a practice is illegal when the State is itself engaged in that practice.⁶⁷ Furthermore, with the exception of the Estonian Government’s reaction to the cyber attacks in 2007, the States’ behaviour cited above does not make clear if their stances cover non-violent cyber attacks, violent cyber attacks, or both. It is similarly unclear from the above People’s Republic of China defence White Paper and the United States Cyber Command defence strategy whether those States were speaking with the threshold of article 2(4) in mind or rather some lower legal threshold concerning State relations, such as the prohibition against coercive intervention in another State’s internal affairs.⁶⁸ As a result, whilst individual State practice does lend some support to there being a prohibition under customary international law against non-violent cyber attacks, the development of such a prohibition remains ambiguous.⁶⁹ ## D. Conclusion as to customary international law Consequently, it is unclear whether customary international law does prohibit non-violent cyber attacks as an unlawful use of force. In each of the three evidentiary sources of United Nations General Assembly Resolutions, treaty law, and other State practice, there are either caveats or contradictory indications. Given this inconclusive evidence, the final step in this article’s analysis is to determine whether non-violent cyber attacks should be considered a ‘use of force’ under customary international law by reason of analogy.\n\nNON-VIOLENT CYBER ATTACKS: A CONTRAVENTION OF ARTICLE 2(4)?\n\nSince the shift in international legal discourse towards the 'living instrument' approach, it has become the accepted practice in international law to classify potential uses of force not on the basis of their mechanisms but on the effects directly caused.70 As a result, if the effects of non-violent cyber attacks can be shown to be comparable to the effects of other behaviour that is generally accepted to be a use of force, then one can legitimately conclude that these cyber attacks should also be considered a use of force under customary international law (and thus, potentially, under article 2(4) of the UN Charter).71 One particularly illustrative comparison is that of economic blockades, which are unilateral acts that interfere with trade between the victim State and all other parties (whether the other parties are willing and unwilling).72 Blockades are typically imposed through the presence of armed forces,73 and are considered an act of aggression (and thus an illegal use of force) under customary international law.74 For this reason, this article shall now compare the most egregious examples of non-violent cyber warfare to an economic blockade.\n## A. Similarity The typical effects of a blockade on a victim State build gradually, and rarely involve immediate physical damage or human death. Instead, lack of access to materials and services in which the victim State previously traded (assuming it is not an economically-isolated State) typically leads to a slow degradation of production and economy. For example, if the victim State previously imported spare parts for its machinery, then its machines will continue to function as normal at the beginning of the blockade but eventually cease to function as the blockade continues, due to lack of spare parts.75 Thus, although the blockade has not directly inflicted any physical damage, over time it does so indirectly.\nIn these respects, non-violent cyber attacks can certainly create the same (indeed, even more pronounced) effects as an economic blockade. First, non-violent AUSTRALIAN INTERNATIONAL LAW JOURNAL cyber attacks can clandestinely change a machine manufacturing process within a victim State such that the resulting products pass initial testing but then become physically unreliable a short time afterwards.76 This would not only damage the victim State's export trade but, if the victim State also creates machines for its own use, lead to a gradual decline in its local equipment as well. Thus, the effects are almost identical to a blockade — disrupted trade relationships and gradual physical damage. Moreover, if the victim State cannot detect or nullify the cyber attack due to its clandestine nature, the victim State has even less ability to avoid its deleterious effects as the State would in an economic blockade.\nSecondly, non-violent cyber attacks have the ability of cutting off a victim State from all computerised trade. For example, a victim State's stock exchange system or banking systems could be repeatedly overloaded or disabled, resulting in any computerised market transactions becoming impossible.77 Like with a traditional economic blockade, the victim State thus has its trade with all its partners prevented by the unilateral actions of an aggressor. Indeed, this type of cyber attack has an even stronger effect than a traditional blockade, in that the cyber attack is preventing trade within the victim State as well as interstate trade.\n## B. Differences However, an important feature of economic blockades that is not found in non-violent cyber attacks is the distinct possibility of direct physical damage and human death. Unlike in cyber blockades, where access is blocked electronically and the victim State can — and usually has to — defend itself electronically, traditional economic blockades involve physical constraints and physical military threats. As such, for a victim State to end an economic blockade, the State must itself resort to armed force that will cause physical damage and likely human death.\nFurthermore, the instigator of a traditional economic blockade typically will be enforcing it with military assets that could, if the instigator desired, also directly cause physical damage and death against the victim State.\nIn other words, traditional economic blockades are a much stronger precursor to armed conflicts than non-violent cyber attacks, which may justify why they are more widely considered to be contraventions of customary international law than cyber attacks.\n## C. Conclusion as to economic blockade analogy In consequence, using an effects-based analogy with economic blockades, one can argue only with moderate justification that non-violent cyber attacks should be considered a use of force under customary international law and article 2(4) of the UN Charter.\n\nNON-VIOLENT CYBER ATTACKS: A CONTRAVENTION OF ARTICLE 2(4)?\n\nIn 1999, legal scholar Anthony D'Amato predicted that ‘attacks on the Internet will soon be seen as clearly illegal under international law’.78 Yet, despite this prediction and the continued willingness of member States and legal scholars in recent decades towards expanding the ambit of the UN Charter, there has been little corresponding agreement as to whether non-violent cyber-based attacks can come under the prohibition in article 2(4).\nIn the area of customary international law, the answer remains mostly ambiguous. The public statements of some States suggest that they believe non-violent cyber attacks can contravene article 2(4), yet those States’ practice indicates otherwise. Similarly, treaty law and General Assembly Resolutions provide only incidental — or conflicting — jurisprudence on cyber warfare’s relationship with article 2(4).\nPerhaps the strongest argument in favour of non-violent cyber attacks being capable of being a ‘use of force’ under article 2(4) is the analogy between non-violent cyber attacks and economic blockades, given their respective effects can be so similar. However, in the absence of clear treaty law or uniform State conduct, it would be surprising if such indirect legal reasoning was enough to change the application of article 2(4), which the ICJ once called a ‘comerstone’ of the UN Charter.79 Accordingly, as far as article 2(4) of the UN Charter is concerned, it would appear that the day of Professor D'Amato’s prediction is yet to arrive.\n\n^{}[]"

This article examines that open question. It argues that, whilst the international community has taken some incremental steps towards updating and extending the prohibition to non-violent cyber attacks, those steps have not yet been clear or widespread enough to change that original exclusion from scope.\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\nWhen the *Charter of the United Nations*¹ came into force in 1945, the cyber world was not just yet to be militarised — it did not exist.

To begin with, the full text of article 2(4) in the UN Charter is as follows:\n\nAll Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.⁶\n\nUnder the customary rule of treaty interpretation enshrined in article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, the terms of the UN Charter are generally to be interpreted in accordance with their ordinary meaning in light of their context, object, and purpose.⁷ A contextual interpretation suggests that the prohibition of\n\n2 This example being drawn from Major Graham H Todd, ‘Armed attack in cyberspace: deterring asymmetric warfare with an asymmetric definition’ [2009] (Winter) 64 Air Force Law Review 65, 96.\n\n3 For examples of academic support for such an effects-based approach to cyber attacks, see: United States Department of Defense, *An Assessment of International Legal Issues in Information Operations* (May 1999) (‘US Defense Report 1999’), 18; Major Arie J Schaap ‘Cyber warfare operations: development and use under international law’ (2009) (Winter) 64 Air Force Law Review 121, 147–148, 172, citing Michael N Schmitt, ‘Wired Warfare: Computer Network Attack and Jus in Bello’ (2002) 84 International Review of the Red Cross 365. See also n 70.\n\n4 Herbert S Lin, ‘Offensive cyber operations and the use of force’ (2010) 4(1) Journal of National Security Law &amp; Policy 63, 77; Matthew C Waxman, ‘Cyber-attacks and the use of force: back to the future of article 2(4)’ (2011) 36(2) The Yale Journal of International Law 421, 443–447; Anna Wortham, ‘Should cyber exploitation ever constitute a demonstration of hostile intent that may violate UN Charter provisions prohibiting the threat or use of force?’ (2012) 64(3) Federal Communications Law Journal 643, 654; US Defense Report 1999 (n 3) 20–21.\n\n5 As demonstrated by the International Court of Justice’s ability to reach a conclusion regarding article 2(4) of the UN Charter and the use of nuclear weapons in *Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons* (Advisory Opinion) [1996] ICJ Rep 1996 (‘Nuclear Weapons (Advisory Opinion)’), despite the absence of any use of nuclear weapons in conflict since the coming into effect of the UN Charter.\n\n6 UN Charter art 2(4).\n\n7 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, opened for signature 23 May 1969, 1155 UNTS 331 (entered into force 27 January 1980) (‘1969 Vienna Convention’) art 31. Whilst article 4 of the 1969 Vienna Convention provides that the 1969 Vienna Convention itself does not apply to the UN Charter (due to the UN Charter pre-dating the 1969 Vienna Convention), the article recognises that the customary international law",
    "NON-VIOLENT CYBER ATTACKS: A CONTRAVENTION OF ARTICLE 2(4)?\n93\n\nforce in article 2(4) is restricted to the traditional, kinetic types akin to those available in the WWII era. For instance, the Preamble to the UN Charter states that ‘armed force shall not be used, save in the common interest’⁸ — the term ‘armed’ implying a physical military dimension.⁹ Given that preambulatory statements are often conceptually more general than the articles that effectuate them, the inclusion of cyber attacks in article 2(4) would lead to an internal textual inconsistency in which a preambulatory term is narrower than its operative article. On the presumption that the drafters of the UN Charter did not intend to create such textual inconsistency, this suggests article 2(4) was not meant to include cyber attacks.¹⁰\n\nFurthermore, article 44 in the UN Charter also implies that ‘use of force’ is simply shorthand for ‘armed force’. Article 44 provides that the United Nations Security Council shall invite certain member States to contribute ‘armed forces … under Article 43’ when the Security Council has resolved to ‘use force’.¹¹ If the phrase ‘use force’ is to include non-armed force like cyber attacks, then a logical inconsistency would arise in which the Security Council can resolve to use non-armed force but is empowered to ask member States to contribute armed force only. Again, on the reasonable presumption that the drafters did not intend such inconsistency, one must conclude that ‘use of force’ (with its close similarity to ‘use force’) refers only to armed force.¹²\n\nThis confinement to armed force is reinforced when one has reference to the preparatory works of the UN Charter, in accordance with the customary rule enshrined in article 32 of the 1969 Vienna Convention. At the San Francisco Conference in which the UN Charter was drafted, the delegation from Brazil proposed the express insertion of economic measures into article 2(4). This proposal was rejected by twenty-six votes to two, indicating that the drafters consciously did not want to include economic coercion within the scope of ‘use of force’.¹³ Given that economic coercion was essentially the only non-armed means of inter-State antagonism in the 1940s, this reinforces that article 2(4) was originally intended to prohibit armed force only.\n\nIndeed, at various times during the early stages of the Cold War, member States of the United Nations raised the notion of article 2(4) applying beyond armed force,\n\nenshrined in the 1969 Vienna Convention can so apply (‘Without prejudice to the application of any rules set forth in the present Convention to which treaties would be subject under international law independently of the Convention …’).\n\n⁸ UN Charter Preamble (‘… to ensure, by the acceptance of principles and the institution of methods, that armed force shall not be used, save in the common interest…’) (emphasis added).\n\n⁹ Waxman (n 4) 428; Michael N Schmitt, ‘Computer Network Attack and the Use of Force in International Law: Thoughts on a Normative Framework’ (1999) 37 Columbia Journal of Transnational Law 885, 904.\n\n¹⁰ Schmitt (n 9) 904.\n\n¹¹ UN Charter art 44 (‘When the Security Council has decided to use force it shall, before calling upon a Member not represented on it to provide armed forces in fulfilment of the obligations assumed under Article 43, invite that Member, if the Member so desires, to participate in the decisions of the Security Council concerning the employment of contingents of that Member’s armed forces.’).\n\n¹² Schmitt (n 9) 904.\n\n¹³ Ibid 905; Michael Gervais, ‘Cyber Attacks and the Laws of War’ [2012] (Winter) 1 Journal of Law &lt;= Cyber Warfare 7, 26. For an interpretation to the contrary, see Ido Kilovaty, ‘Rethinking the Prohibition on the Use of Force in the Light of Economic Cyber Warfare: Towards a Broader Scope of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter’ (2015) 4(3) Journal of Law &lt;= Cyber Warfare 210, 230–231.",
    "AUSTRALIAN INTERNATIONAL LAW JOURNAL\n\nbut this expansion did not gain sufficient support in academia¹⁴ nor was it reflected in representative State practice.¹⁵ In 1970, international lawyer Thomas Franck even went so far as to declare that article 2(4) had been ‘killed’ due to its non-application (at the time) to the arming of insurgencies in proxy wars,¹⁶ which is an action more akin to traditional armed force than cyber attacks.\n\nFinally, for completeness, little guidance can be gleaned from the ‘against the territorial integrity or political independence’ qualifier to ‘use of force’ that is found in article 2(4). This is because the preparatory works of the UN Charter make it sufficiently clear that the qualifier is not meant to restrict the meaning of article 2(4).¹⁷ Moreover, the open-endedness of ‘or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations’ extends the scope of article 2(4) to virtually any ‘use of force’ that is not expressly authorised elsewhere in the UN Charter.¹⁸ It is thus clear that article 2(4) was considered — at least originally — to be limited to physical examples of force (indeed, only certain such examples), thus excluding cyber attacks.\n\n## III IS THE UN CHARTER A ‘LIVING INSTRUMENT’?\n\nDespite this clarity of original intent, article 2(4) has subsequently been treated as a ‘living instrument’ by two organs of the United Nations itself: the International Court of Justice and the United Nations General Assembly. Whilst neither of these organs has authority to amend the words of the UN Charter,¹⁹ their status within the United Nations accords them particularly authoritative weight in interpreting the UN Charter.²⁰\n\n14 Quincy Wright, ‘Subversive Intervention’ (1960) 54(3) The American Journal of International Law 521, 529 (‘It is clear that [its provisions] prohibit only the threat or use of armed force or an armed attack. They cannot be construed to include other hostile acts such as propaganda, infiltration or subversion.’), quoted in Waxman (n 4) 430.\n\n15 Waxman (n 4) 428–430, 449.\n\n16 Thomas M Franck, ‘Who Killed Article 2(4)? Or: Changing Norms Governing the Use of Force by States’ (1970) 64(4) The American Journal of International Law 809, 812, cited in Waxman (n 4) 441.\n\n17 James Crawford, *Brownlie’s Principles of Public International Law* (Oxford University Press, 8th ed, 2012) 747, citing Corfu Channel case (Judgment) [1949] ICJ Rep 4, 35.\n\n18 Schmitt (n 9) 901. Of course, this does not answer what constitutes a ‘use of force’ in the first place.\n\n19 Amending the UN Charter effectively requires a two-thirds vote of the United Nations General Assembly, followed by ratification by two-thirds of Members (including the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council): UN Charter art 108 and 109.\n\n20 Under article 7 of the UN Charter, both the International Court of Justice and the General Assembly are ‘principal organs’ of the United Nations. The General Assembly comprises all members of the United Nations (article 9(1) of the UN Charter) and, in accordance with the customary rules of treaty interpretation enshrined in article 31(3)(a) and (b) of the 1969 Vienna Convention, practices or agreement amongst the United Nations members regarding the application of the UN Charter — such as United Nations General Assembly resolutions — can be relevant to the interpretation of the UN Charter. As for the authoritative weight of the International Court of Justice, the UN Charter states the Court to be the ‘principal judicial organ’ of the United Nations and every member to be a party to the Statute of the Court: articles 92 and 93(1) of the UN Charter. The US Department of Defense makes a similar point about the influence of the International Court of Justice and the United Nations General Assembly on customary international law: US Defense Report 1999 (n 3) 1 (‘…certain actions of some international institutions, such as the International Court of Justice and the UN General Assembly, are considered to be persuasive evidence of the existence of principles of customary international law’).",
    "NON-VIOLENT CYBER ATTACKS: A CONTRAVENTION OF ARTICLE 2(4)?\n95\n\nIn 1971, the International Court of Justice held that the UN Charter, as an international instrument, can — indeed, must — be:\n\ninterpreted and applied within the framework of the entire legal system prevailing at the time of the interpretation.²¹\n\nTherefore, by logical inference, the interpretation of the UN Charter must continuously change as the entire international legal system continuously changes around it.\n\nMore recently, the United Nations General Assembly has passed multiple Resolutions by considerable majority votes²² with the following preambulatory statement:\n\n… Confirming the conclusions of the Group of Governmental Experts, in its 2013 and 2015 reports, that international law, and in particular the Charter of the United Nations, is applicable and essential to maintaining peace and stability and promoting an open, secure, stable, accessible and peaceful information and communications technology environment …²³\n\nTherefore, one can see that the expansive ‘living instrument’ approach towards article 2(4), whilst by no means unanimous, has grounding in international legal discourse — including in the cyber context.²⁴ As a consequence, it may in fact be possible for the general prohibition contained in article 2(4) of the UN Charter to be interpreted to include cyber attacks.\n\n²¹ Legal Consequences for States of the Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia (South West Africa) notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276 (1970) (Advisory Opinion) [1971] ICJ Rep 16, 31 [53] (emphasis added). Similarly, the International Court of Justice has expansively applied article 31(3)(c) of the 1969 Vienna Convention, which enshines the customary rule of treaty interpretation that ‘any relevant rules of international law applicable in relations between the parties [to the treaty being interpreted]’ are to be taken into account: Oil Platforms (Islamic Republic of Iran v.

    "AUSTRALIAN INTERNATIONAL LAW JOURNAL\n\n## IV DOES CUSTOMARY INTERNATIONAL LAW PROHIBIT NON-VIOLENT CYBER ATTACKS?\n\nNow that we can have some degree of certainty that article 2(4) of the UN Charter can be adapted to new modes of warfare, it becomes appropriate to ask whether customary international law has determined the legality of non-violent cyber attacks already. This is relevant because, according to the International Court of Justice's above quotation from Namibia (Advisory Opinion), the entire legal system — including customary international law — affects the contemporary interpretation of the term 'use of force' in article 2(4). Accordingly, if the equivalent principles regarding uses of force extend to non-violent cyber attacks under customary international law, then there is good reason to argue that article 2(4) must be given the same expansive interpretation.\n\nCustomary international law is difficult to delineate precisely, but it can be sourced from international legal discourse. Of particular relevance for this article are three such evidentiary sources: United Nations General Assembly Resolutions, treaty law, and other forms of State practice that signify a legal duty is believed to exist.²⁵\n\n## A. General Assembly Resolutions\n\nIn 1974, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Resolution on the Definition of Aggression,²⁶ to which was annexed the 'Definition of Aggression'. As recognised by the International Court of Justice in its 1986 judgment of Nicaragua v United States of America (Merits), the Resolution on the Definition of Aggression represents a significant source of customary international law concerning the use of force.²⁷ The Resolution on the Definition of Aggression was also adopted by consensus,²⁸ which enhances its potential influence on customary international law.²⁹\n\nWith a preambulatory statement that 'aggression' is the 'most serious and dangerous form of the illegal use of force' (a clear reflection of article 2(4) of the UN Charter), one of the non-exhaustive examples of aggression given in the Definition of Aggression annex to the Resolution on the Definition of Aggression is found in article 3(b) of the annex:\n\n²⁵ All three sources' relevance to customary international law is cited in Military and Paramilitary Activities In and Against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States of America) (Merits) [1986] ICJ Rep 1986 ('Nicaragua (Merits)'), 99–100 [188]. For a non-exhaustive, but detailed, list of sources of customary international law, see Michael Wood, Special Rapporteur, Second report on identification of customary international law, International Law Commission, 66th Session, UN Doc A/CN.4/672 (1 October 2014) 22–33 [41]–[46].\n\n²⁶ Resolution on the Definition of Aggression, GA Res 3314, UN GAOR, 34th sess, 2319th plen mtg, UN Doc A/Res/3314 (14 December 1974) ('Resolution on the Definition of Aggression').\n\n²⁷ Nicaragua (Merits) (n 25) 103–104 [195].\n\n²⁸ Wing Commander Duncan Blake and Lieutenant Colonel Joseph S Imburgia, “‘Bloodless weapons’?

    "NON-VIOLENT CYBER ATTACKS: A CONTRAVENTION OF ARTICLE 2(4)?\n97\n\nBombardment by the armed forces of a State against the territory of another State or the use of any weapons by a State against the territory of another State.³⁰\n\nWhat this example suggests is that, if non-violent cyber attacks can be classified as the use of a ‘weapon’, then a State’s use of non-violent cyber attacks against another State would most likely contravene the customary international legal principle that is equivalent to article 2(4) of the UN Charter.³¹ Unfortunately, however, since the Resolution on the Definition of Aggression does not define its use of the term ‘weapon’, one must instead turn to other sources to extrapolate its meaning.\n\nOne possible means of clarification of the term ‘weapon’ comes from article 36 of the Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (Protocol I), 8 June 1977,³² which also uses the term.³³ Although there is no definition of ‘weapon’ within the 1977 Additional Protocol I either, the accompanying official commentary from the International Committee of the Red Cross (‘ICRC’) puts ‘weapon’ so expansively that it appears almost certain to include cyber attacks. In particular, the ICRC commentary states that ‘weapon’ is to be construed ‘in the widest sense’ with respect to the way in which it is used, and does not necessarily need to be lethal.³⁴ Thus, by linking the definition of ‘weapon’ contained in article 36 of the 1977 Additional Protocol I to the same word used in the Resolution on the Definition of Aggression, one could conclude that cyber attacks can be a ‘weapon’ of aggression and, therefore, capable of being an illegal use of force under customary international law.³⁵\n\nHowever, two important caveats must be made to this ‘weapon’ connection. First, the 1977 Additional Protocol I is a treaty concerning jus in bello (legality of conduct during conflict), whereas the Resolution on the Definition of Aggression and article 2(4) of the UN Charter concern jus ad bellum (legality of conflict commencement). As a result, the customary legal principles embodied in each are likely to be different from one another, thereby limiting their mutual applicability.\n\nSecondly, the existence of the same phrase in two different instruments of law does not necessarily mean that the same meaning is intended across both contexts. As a result, the term ‘weapon’ in the 1977 Additional Protocol I could well be denoting\n\n30 Resolution on the Definition of Aggression (n 26) annex Preamble (‘... Considering also that, since aggression is the most serious and dangerous form of the illegal use of force ...’ (emphasis original)), art 3(b) (emphasis added).\n\n31 Todd makes a similar argument in relation to ‘armed attack’ under article 51 of the UN Charter.

Treaty law\n\nThe second possible source of the illegality of cyber attacks comes from treaty law, which can both influence and codify principles of customary international law.³⁷ One treaty that is of incidental relevance to cyber warfare is the Constitution and Convention of the International Telecommunication Union.³⁸ Most relevantly, article 45 of the ITU Convention prohibits ‘harmful interference’ of radio services and communications of other members of the International Telecommunication Union. ‘Harmful interference’ is defined in the annex to the ITU Convention as:\n\nInterference which endangers the functioning of a radionavigation service or of other safety services or seriously degrades, obstructs or repeatedly interrupts a radio communication service . . .³⁹\n\nDespite containing no reference to ‘use of force’, article 45 of the ITU Convention is relevant in that it prohibits the blocking of telecommunication devices — a common effect of cyber attacks. Moreover, it is a treaty considered to apply primarily during peacetime,⁴⁰ which is when the jus ad bellum parameters of article 2(4) of the UN Charter are relevant. As such, with its near-unanimous adoption,⁴¹ the ITU Convention represents at least a minor indication that non-violent cyber attacks are capable of contravening customary international law regarding the use of force, and thus potentially article 2(4) of the UN Charter as well.\n\nConversely, the Convention Respecting the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers and Persons in Case of War on Land 1907⁴² is a treaty that could be shaping customary international law against a prohibition of non-violent cyber attacks. Under article 8 of the 1907 Neutrality Convention, a State’s neutrality is not violated by belligerents’ use of the State’s ‘telegraphy or telephone cables or … wireless telegraphy apparatus’.⁴³ By contrast, the Resolution on the Definition of Aggression includes a State ‘allowing its territory… to be used by [another] State for perpetrating an act of\n\n³⁶ Ibid 189.\n\n³⁷ Nicaragua (Merits) (n 25) 94–95 (177).\n\n³⁸ Constitution and Convention of the International Telecommunication Union, concluded 22 December 1992, 1825, 1826 UNTS (entered into force 1 July 1994) (‘ITU Constitution’ and ‘ITU Convention’).

    "NON-VIOLENT CYBER ATTACKS: A CONTRAVENTION OF ARTICLE 2(4)?\n99\n\naggression' as an example of aggression.44 Therefore, if a cyber attack through telecommunications can be a use of force under customary international law, then a willing cyber-host State would be maintaining neutrality under the 1907 Neutrality Convention yet committing aggression under the Resolution on the Definition of Aggression — a contradiction in terms. Thus, this suggests that cyber attacks are not a use of force under customary international law.45\n\nHaving said this, though, it is worth noting that the 1907 Neutrality Convention is of considerable age and thus is less likely to reflect today's customary international law, especially in the fast-changing realm of technology. In addition, there is nothing in the 1907 Neutrality Convention to suggest that it applies to the many types of modern technological systems that generate electronic information (such as satellite imagery and navigation systems), rather than just to those that simply relay communications ('telegraphy').46 Thus, the indication in the 1907 Neutrality Convention that cyber attacks are not a use of force should be considered relevant to the slightest degree only.\n\nAccordingly, treaty law does not provide strong or consistent guidance either.\n\n## C. Other State practice\n\nThe third evidentiary source of customary international law that could signify the status of cyber attacks is the individual conduct of the States themselves (as opposed to the collective acts of passing General Assembly resolutions and entering treaties). This is a well-recognised notion in which the conduct — both proactive and passive — and statements of member States can, if widespread and consistent enough, develop and reflect customary international law.47\n\nGiven that customary international law is most readily interpreted from the actions of States whose interests are specially affected,48 three member States whose approaches to cyber attacks are likely particularly relevant are the People's Republic of China (as the State with the most Internet users),49 the United States of America (as the most populous State with over 90% of the population using the Internet),50\n\n44 Resolution on the Definition of Aggression (n 26) annex art 3(f) ('Any of the following acts, regardless of a declaration of war, shall, subject to and in accordance with the provisions of article 2, qualify as an act of aggression... The action of a State in allowing its territory, which it has placed at the disposal of another State, to be used by that other State for perpetrating an act of aggression against a third State').\n\n45 A similar conclusion is reached in Blake and Imburgia (n 28) 186–187 about the 1907 Neutrality Convention without reference to the Resolution on the Definition of Aggression.\n\n46 US Defense Report 1999 (n 3) 10.\n\n47 North Sea Continental Shelf (Federal Republic of Germany v Denmark; Federal Republic of Germany v Netherlands) (Judgment) [1969] ICJ Rep 3 ('North Sea Continental Shelf'), 28–29 [37], 44 [77]; Nicaragua (Merits) (n 25) 98–100 [186]–[188]; Continental Shelf (Libyan Arab Jarnabiriya/Malta) (Judgment) [1985] ICJ Rep 13, 29–30 [27]; Wood (n 25) 22–31 [41]–[44].\n\n48 North Sea Continental Shelf (n 47) 41–42 [73]–[74], partially cited in Scott J Shackelford, 'From nuclear war to net war: analogizing cyber attacks in international law' (2009) 27(1) Berkeley Journal of International Law 192, 218 and in ILC Draft Conclusions (n 23), 136–137.\n\n49 For a comparison of the total number of Internet users in different States in 2020, see Central Intelligence Agency, Field Listing — Internet Users (2022) <https: internet-users=\"\" file=\"\" file.=\"\" file.indd=\"\" www.cia.gov=\"\"></https:>.

The Estonian Government even raised the prospect of invoking the collective self-defence mechanism of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (‘NATO’) in response to the cyber attacks.⁶¹ It is therefore clear from the Estonian Government’s actions that it, too, considers cyber attacks to be capable of constituting a use of force.\n\nIndeed, NATO — of which the USA and the Republic of Estonia are members⁶² — has itself made postures indicating that, as a collective regional organisation, it views cyber attacks as potentially constituting a use of force under article 2(4) of the UN Charter. In 2014, in its Wales Summit Declaration, NATO declared that:\n\n… international law, including international humanitarian law and the UN Charter, applies in cyberspace …. A decision as to when a cyber attack would lead to the invocation of Article 5 [of the North Atlantic Treaty] would be taken by the North Atlantic Council on a case-by-case basis.⁶³\n\nWhat is particularly pertinent here is that article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, which the Republic of Estonia sought to invoke in 2007, mirrors and expressly cites article 51 of the UN Charter.⁶⁴ Article 51 of the UN Charter is enlivened if one State commits an ‘armed attack’ against another State, and ‘armed attack’ is widely interpreted to mean more egregious uses of force than those contemplated in article 2(4) of the UN Charter.⁶⁵ In other words, by definition, any action that is an armed attack in article 51 must also be a use of force in article 2(4).\n\nAs such, the fact that NATO has publicly declared that the question is ‘when’ (not ‘if’) a cyber attack can enliven article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty is very strong evidence that the member States of NATO — all 30 of whom are also members of\n\n⁵⁸ Hinkle (n 56) 13.\n\n⁵⁹ Shackelford (n 48) 194.\n\n⁶⁰ NATO and Cyber Defence 2009 (n 53) 6 [25], 12 [59].\n\n⁶¹ Shackelford (n 48) 193; Schaap (n 3) 144; NATO and Cyber Defence 2009 (n 53) 12 [58]–[59].\n\n⁶² North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Member countries (Webpage, 24 September 2020) <https: en=\"\" ntolive=\"\" nanolive=\"\" topics_52044.htm=\"\" topics_52044.html=\"\" www.nato.int=\"\"> (‘NATO Member Webpage’).\n\n⁶³ NATO, Wales Summit Declaration, 5 September 2014, 72, cited in Gray (n 29) 35.

This is because the building up of offensive cyber capabilities in a State’s military can also be construed as an implicit stance that cyber attacks do not contravene article 2(4) of the UN Charter. Not only would one presume that a State would publicly invest only in military technologies that the State considers legal, but there is also the international law doctrine of *tu quoque* — that is, a State has no standing to claim a practice is illegal when the State is itself engaged in that practice.⁶⁷\n\nFurthermore, with the exception of the Estonian Government’s reaction to the cyber attacks in 2007, the States’ behaviour cited above does not make clear if their stances cover non-violent cyber attacks, violent cyber attacks, or both. It is similarly unclear from the above People’s Republic of China defence White Paper and the United States Cyber Command defence strategy whether those States were speaking with the threshold of article 2(4) in mind or rather some lower legal threshold concerning State relations, such as the prohibition against coercive intervention in another State’s internal affairs.⁶⁸\n\nAs a result, whilst individual State practice does lend some support to there being a prohibition under customary international law against non-violent cyber attacks, the development of such a prohibition remains ambiguous.⁶⁹\n\n## D.

In each of the three evidentiary sources of United Nations General Assembly Resolutions, treaty law, and other State practice, there are either caveats or contradictory indications.

    "NON-VIOLENT CYBER ATTACKS: A CONTRAVENTION OF ARTICLE 2(4)?\n103\n\n# V ARE NON-VIOLENT CYBER ATTACKS ANALOGOUS TO ECONOMIC BLOCKADES?\n\nSince the shift in international legal discourse towards the 'living instrument' approach, it has become the accepted practice in international law to classify potential uses of force not on the basis of their mechanisms but on the effects directly caused.70 As a result, if the effects of non-violent cyber attacks can be shown to be comparable to the effects of other behaviour that is generally accepted to be a use of force, then one can legitimately conclude that these cyber attacks should also be considered a use of force under customary international law (and thus, potentially, under article 2(4) of the UN Charter).71\n\nOne particularly illustrative comparison is that of economic blockades, which are unilateral acts that interfere with trade between the victim State and all other parties (whether the other parties are willing and unwilling).72 Blockades are typically imposed through the presence of armed forces,73 and are considered an act of aggression (and thus an illegal use of force) under customary international law.74 For this reason, this article shall now compare the most egregious examples of non-violent cyber warfare to an economic blockade.\n\n## A. Similarity\n\nThe typical effects of a blockade on a victim State build gradually, and rarely involve immediate physical damage or human death. Instead, lack of access to materials and services in which the victim State previously traded (assuming it is not an economically-isolated State) typically leads to a slow degradation of production and economy. For example, if the victim State previously imported spare parts for its machinery, then its machines will continue to function as normal at the beginning of the blockade but eventually cease to function as the blockade continues, due to lack of spare parts.75 Thus, although the blockade has not directly inflicted any physical damage, over time it does so indirectly.\n\nIn these respects, non-violent cyber attacks can certainly create the same (indeed, even more pronounced) effects as an economic blockade. First, non-violent\n\n70 Resolution on the Definition of Aggression (n 26) annex art 2, cited in Todd (n 2) 76, 78 and in Blake and Imburgia (n 28) 188; Lin (n 4) 73; Nicaragua (Merits) (n 25) 103 [195] ('... the prohibition of armed attacks may apply to the sending by a State of armed bands to the territory of another State, if such an operation, because of its scale and effects, would have been classified as an armed attack rather than as a mere frontier incident had it been carried out by regular armed forces ...' (emphasis added)).\n\n71 See also Tallinn 2.0 (n 68) 331 ('A cyber operation constitutes a use of force when its scale and effects are comparable to non-cyber operations rising to the level of a use of force') in relation to cyber attacks in general, the prior version of which is cited in Gray (n 29) 34.\n\n72 Lin (n 4) 80.\n\n73 As recognised in article 42 of the UN Charter, which describes a blockade as an example of 'action by air, sea, or land forces'.\n\n74 Lin (n 4) 81–82. Resolution on the Definition of Aggression (n 26) annex art 3(c) specifically lists blockading a port or coast as an act of aggression ('The blockade of the ports or coasts of a State by the armed forces of another State'). Indeed, articles 41 and 42 of the UN Charter imply that blockades are a use of force, by referring to blockades as an example of 'action by air, sea, or land forces' that is available for the Security Council to take if 'measures not involving the use of armed force' are inadequate.\n\n75 Lin (n 4) 81–82.",
    "AUSTRALIAN INTERNATIONAL LAW JOURNAL\n\ncyber attacks can clandestinely change a machine manufacturing process within a victim State such that the resulting products pass initial testing but then become physically unreliable a short time afterwards.76 This would not only damage the victim State's export trade but, if the victim State also creates machines for its own use, lead to a gradual decline in its local equipment as well. Thus, the effects are almost identical to a blockade — disrupted trade relationships and gradual physical damage. Moreover, if the victim State cannot detect or nullify the cyber attack due to its clandestine nature, the victim State has even less ability to avoid its deleterious effects as the State would in an economic blockade.\n\nSecondly, non-violent cyber attacks have the ability of cutting off a victim State from all computerised trade. For example, a victim State's stock exchange system or banking systems could be repeatedly overloaded or disabled, resulting in any computerised market transactions becoming impossible.77 Like with a traditional economic blockade, the victim State thus has its trade with all its partners prevented by the unilateral actions of an aggressor. Indeed, this type of cyber attack has an even stronger effect than a traditional blockade, in that the cyber attack is preventing trade within the victim State as well as interstate trade.\n\n## B. Differences\n\nHowever, an important feature of economic blockades that is not found in non-violent cyber attacks is the distinct possibility of direct physical damage and human death. Unlike in cyber blockades, where access is blocked electronically and the victim State can — and usually has to — defend itself electronically, traditional economic blockades involve physical constraints and physical military threats. As such, for a victim State to end an economic blockade, the State must itself resort to armed force that will cause physical damage and likely human death.\n\nFurthermore, the instigator of a traditional economic blockade typically will be enforcing it with military assets that could, if the instigator desired, also directly cause physical damage and death against the victim State.\n\nIn other words, traditional economic blockades are a much stronger precursor to armed conflicts than non-violent cyber attacks, which may justify why they are more widely considered to be contraventions of customary international law than cyber attacks.\n\n## C. Conclusion as to economic blockade analogy\n\nIn consequence, using an effects-based analogy with economic blockades, one can argue only with moderate justification that non-violent cyber attacks should be considered a use of force under customary international law and article 2(4) of the UN Charter.\n\n76 Ibid 75.\n\n77 Ibid 74.",
    "NON-VIOLENT CYBER ATTACKS: A CONTRAVENTION OF ARTICLE 2(4)?\n105\n\n# VI CONCLUSION\n\nIn 1999, legal scholar Anthony D'Amato predicted that ‘attacks on the Internet will soon be seen as clearly illegal under international law’.78 Yet, despite this prediction and the continued willingness of member States and legal scholars in recent decades towards expanding the ambit of the UN Charter, there has been little corresponding agreement as to whether non-violent cyber-based attacks can come under the prohibition in article 2(4).\n\nIn the area of customary international law, the answer remains mostly ambiguous. The public statements of some States suggest that they believe non-violent cyber attacks can contravene article 2(4), yet those States’ practice indicates otherwise. Similarly, treaty law and General Assembly Resolutions provide only incidental — or conflicting — jurisprudence on cyber warfare’s relationship with article 2(4).\n\nPerhaps the strongest argument in favour of non-violent cyber attacks being capable of being a ‘use of force’ under article 2(4) is the analogy between non-violent cyber attacks and economic blockades, given their respective effects can be so similar. However, in the absence of clear treaty law or uniform State conduct, it would be surprising if such indirect legal reasoning was enough to change the application of article 2(4), which the ICJ once called a ‘comerstone’ of the UN Charter.79\n\nAccordingly, as far as article 2(4) of the UN Charter is concerned, it would appear that the day of Professor D'Amato’s prediction is yet to arrive.\n\n78 Anthony D'Amato, ‘International Law, Cybernetics, and Cyberspace’ (1999) 76 International Law Studies 59, cited in Waxman (n 4) 425.\n\n79 Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo (Democratic Republic of the Congo v.

This article examines that open question. It argues that, whilst the international community has taken some incremental steps towards updating and extending the prohibition to non-violent cyber attacks, those steps have not yet been clear or widespread enough to change that original exclusion from scope.",
