Studying cyber deterrence presents even greater challenges, as traditional deterrence challenges are exacerbated and interactions in the cyber domain create further difficulties. When studying cyber deterrence, scholars face uncertainty not only in identifying situations of deterrence success, but also—due to the secrecy surrounding cyber practices—in identifying situations of deterrence failure. Despite the many studies on cyber deterrence, methodological solutions to address these challenges still need to be developed. To this end, I suggest focusing on the adoption and employment of the strategy rather than on its success. I argue that since communicating threats is a core element of deterrence, it is easier to observe how the strategy is adopted and employed than whether it succeeds or fails. This focus provides a promising direction to study cyber deterrence and address these challenges.\n\nEl estudio de disuasión presenta una serie de desafíos, principalmente relacionados con la identificación de casos de éxito de disuasión y la definición de su funcionamiento. El estudio de la ciberdisuasión presenta desafíos aún mayores, ya que los desafíos tradicionales de la disuasión se ven exacerbados y las interacciones en el ámbito cibernético generan más dificultades. Al estudiar la ciberdisuasión, los académicos se enfrentan a la incertidumbre no solo a la hora de identificar situaciones de éxito de disuasión, sino también a la hora de identificar situaciones de fracaso de disuasión debido a la confidencialidad que gira en torno a las prácticas cibernéticas. A pesar de los numerosos estudios sobre la ciberdisuasión, todavía es necesario desarrollar soluciones metodológicas para abordar estos desafíos. Para lograrlo, sugiero enfocarse en la adopción e implementación de la estrategia más que en su éxito. Sostengo que, dado que comunicar amenazas es un elemento clave de la disuasión, es más fácil observar cómo se adopta e implementa la estrategia que identificar si tiene éxito o fracasa. Este enfoque marca un rumbo prometedor para estudiar la ciberdisuasión y abordar estos desafíos.\n\nL'étude de la dissuasion présente un certain nombre de défis qui sont principalement liés à l'identification de la réussite de la dissuasion et à la définition de la manière dont la dissuasion fonctionne.

Lorsqu'ils étudient la cyber-dissuasion, les chercheurs sont confrontés à de l'incertitude, non seulement dans l'identification des situations de réussite de la dissuasion, mais aussi—en raison du secret entourant les cyber-pratiques—dans l'identification de celles de son échec. Malgré les nombreuses études portant sur la cyber-dissuasion, des solutions méthodologiques doivent encore être développées pour aborder ces défis. À cette fin, je suggère une concentration sur l'adoption et l'emploi de la stratégie plutôt que sur son succès. Je soutiens qu'étant donné que la communication des menaces est un élément fondamental de la dissuasion, il est plus facile d'observer la façon dont la stratégie est adoptée et employée que d'observer si elle réussit ou échoue. Cette approche offre une orientation prometteuse pour étudier la cyber-dissuasion et aborder ces défis.\n\nKeywords: cyber, deterrence, methodology\nPalabras clave: cibernética, disuasión, metodología\nMots clés: cyber, dissuasion, méthodologie\n\n# Introduction\n\nResearch on cyber deterrence is rich and developing quickly. While scholars have pointed to the challenges of practicing cyber deterrence, their focus—like that of most deterrence scholars—has been on deterrence success. Most studies assess whether and how deterrence by punishment can be applied to the cyber domain (e.g., in Wilner 2020, 252–54), or whether and how it should be replaced with other strategies or types of deterrence, such as deterrence by denial (Iasiello 2013), or by cumulative deterrence (Tor 2017). These studies are part of the tendency Stevens (2016, 24) observes of cyber security studies to be “commonly oriented towards policy concerns.” Nonetheless, less attention is given to methodological challenges around studying cyber deterrence. This article aims to advance the methodology of studying (cyber) deterrence by offering a categorization of the methodological challenges concerning studying deterrence and by offering an alternative way to explore this strategy.\n\nInspired by the dog that did not bark problem—a bias in the study of deterrence toward cases of deterrence failure (Sauer 2016, 49)—I categorize three clusters of problems regarding the study of deterrence. Besides the dog that did not bark problem, I group additional challenges into two clusters of problems that I term the dog that did bark and the dog that should have barked problems. The former refers to challenges around interpreting cases of deterrence success and failure, and the latter to a bias that stems from the difficulty of identifying attacks and therefore seeing them as deterrence failures.\n\nBased on this categorization, I review and illustrate the challenges in studying cyber deterrence and the limited applicability of the current solutions offered to address them. These challenges include identifying deterrence success, selecting appropriate cases, and establishing causal connections between issuing the deterrent threat and deterrence success. While these problems generally characterize the study of deterrence, they are exacerbated in studying cyber deterrence, mainly because we cannot observe cyber deterrence successes and failures.\n\nI claim that one way to solve the challenges in studying cyber deterrence strategy is to shift focus from deterrence success to its adoption and employment. While this is\n\n¹Studying the adoption of cyber deterrence strategies overlaps with broader attempts to explore the motivation behind cyber strategies (e.g., Valeriano, Jensen, and Maness 2018; Gomez 2021).",

While I rely on this scholarship, I also aim to advance it. The main goal for most of these works is to describe the evolution of the strategy rather than to explain the phenomenon of adopting the strategy. I suggest that using the adoption and employment of the strategy as the explained phenomenon (i.e., *explanandum*) is a promising method because of the observability of these aspects of the strategy. Communicating threats is a core element of a deterrence strategy, which makes the strategy’s adoption and employment much more explicit than its success or failure. This allows me to offer a categorization of how actors diverge in adopting and applying deterrence strategies, based on the goal, type, means, and explicitness of the strategy. This in turn provides a useful framework to study deterrence, and especially cyber deterrence strategies. Furthermore, as I demonstrate below, the study of the adoption and employment of cyber deterrence strategies encourages methodological pluralism, open to both positivist and interpretative methods.\n\nThe article proceeds as follows: In the first section, I discuss the main problems in the study of deterrence and the main solutions scholars offer to address them. In the second part, I specify the increased pressure of these challenges when studying cyber deterrence and argue that most solutions are not sufficient to remedy the problems. The third section develops a methodology for studying cyber deterrence, based on different characteristics that concern the adoption of the strategy. The fourth section shows and illustrates the promise of focusing on the adoption and employment of cyber deterrence to address the challenges. Such focus provides new research questions, explanations, and hypotheses, and diversifies the research of this strategy. I conclude by discussing the implications of this study on deterrence research in general and on cyber security research.\n\n## Methodological Challenges in Studying Deterrence\n\nScholars studying deterrence have paid a great deal of attention to methodological issues.³ While it is beyond this paper’s scope to discuss all the methodological challenges in the study of deterrence, I group the main challenges into three clusters. The first is based on what scholars refer to as the dog that did not bark problem. Building on this, I introduce two further problems: the dog that did bark and the dog that should have barked (see table 1).\n\n## The Dog That Did Not Bark\n\nThe dog that did not bark problem revolves around selection bias in studying cases of deterrence failure. Scholars are referring to Sherlock Holmes’ ability to solve a murder mystery based on the fact that a dog, present at the night of the murder, did not bark. Key to solving the case is the idea that there is meaning in the fact that something did not happen. The dog did not bark because the dog knew the perpetrator (see also Sauer 2016, 49). Based on this analogy, scholars have pointed to the flawed tendency to focus only on cases of deterrence failure, which provide\n\n³For reviews and comparisons of cyber strategies of different countries, see Thomas (2009), Lewis and Neuneck (2013), Luiijf, Besseling, Spoelstra, and De Graaf (2013), Liveri and Sarri (2014), and Baezner and Cordey (2019). See also King and Gallagher (2020, 144–45).\n\n³The debates over how to study deterrence, advanced not only research on deterrence and security, but also, and more broadly, studies in international relations (IR) and political science (e.g., see in King, Keohane, and Verba 1994, 24,134–35).",

Positivist scholars use this analogy to challenge scholars' ability to provide a full coloration given that they focus on one possible value of the examined variable of deterrence success—that is, deterrence failure. Some scholars have even suggested the problem is deeper, since focusing on deterrence failures leads to exploration of much more resolute actors—those “who select themselves into crises” and therefore are less likely to be deterred (Danilovic 2002, 117–19; Fearon 2002, 6, 14; see also Wilner 2015, 190, footnote 4, p. 241).\n\nWhile the problematic tendency to focus on cases of deterrence failure clearly exists, it should be noted that lack of violence is not a nonoccurrence. As Tannenwald, emphasizes, \"[T]here is no such thing as explaining a non-event . . . What is actually being explained is a contrast between an actual event and a possible alternative counterfactual event.\" What we are in fact asking is not why the dog did not bark, but why the dog was silent, as we have a reasonable expectation that in such situations the counterfactual (e.g., barking) is a likely scenario (Tannenwald 2007, 30). From this perspective, when deterrence succeeds (and there is no violence) something does happen: policymakers decide that the cost of violence is too high for them to pursue the act the defender aims to prevent. Put differently, it is not that nothing happened, but rather that we cannot easily see it.\n\n## The Dog That Did Bark\n\nI use the phrase the dog that did bark to refer to difficulties around interpreting observations. We cannot deduce an occurrence from an event that correlates with another event. Usually dogs bark when they notice a suspicious person (e.g., a potential murderer); however, of course, we cannot deduce, just because a dog barked that a murder has taken place. Similarly, in the absence of suspicious activity, dogs do not bark. But the fact a dog did not bark does not mean no crime occurred. This analogy allows us to group a number of challenges around determining deterrence failure and success and their implications.\n\nNotably, the eruption of violence does not necessarily indicate deterrence failure. First, deterrence success is not a binary variable. For example, some scholars argue that, unlike nuclear deterrence, in cases of low(er) levels of violence, decreasing the amount of violence can be considered deterrence success even if it does not totally prevent the violence (Rid 2012; Wenger and Wilner 2012, 318). Second, paradoxically, in some cases, deterrence success increases the level of violence, as an opponent can execute a challenge to provoke retaliation in order to attain political gain.\n\nNonetheless, not only can we not deduce deterrence failure from violence, but, and more importantly, we cannot deduce deterrence success from observing lack of violence. For example, there may be no challenger. As Morgan (2003, 121) argues, if a state \"has no intention of attacking the case cannot tell us whether deterrence works and how.\" In addition, even if the challenger has motivation to attack the defender, it may refrain for reasons other than the deterrent posture of the defender.\n\n4 Basically, this challenge could also be termed the dog that did not bark problem. However, in order to avoid confusion, I group this challenge—concerning interpretation of events—as the dog that did bark problem, while I group the problem of bias in case selection as the dog that did not bark.\n\n5 For example, Mendelsohn (2003, 97–100) interprets the rockets Iraq launched over Israel during the Gulf War in 1992 as an attempt to erode the American-led coalition by provoking Israel to retaliate, assuming that given its credible deterrent posture it would not be able to contain such an attack.\n\n6 The struggle between Israel and Hizbullah clearly demonstrates this point. Many Israeli officials (e.g., Halutz 2009, 66; Olmert 2014, 15) and scholars (e.g., Aran 2012, 854; Rid 2012, 141) assert that Israel established a deterrent posture vis-à-vis Hizbullah, evident in Hizbullah’s restraint after the 2006 War. However, alternative explanations exist for Hizbullah’s relative restraint in different periods of time, including Hizbullah’s limited capability after the war, its",

The challenge of classifying cases is exacerbated by the fact that actors see themselves as the defender and their opponent as the challenger (Lebow and Stein 1989, 221, 223; Morgan 2003, 121–22).\n\n## The Dog That Should Have Barked\n\nWhile the two challenges presented above—the dog that did not bark and the dog that did bark—group and refer to known problems and biases in the study of deterrence, the dog that should have barked emphasizes a less-studied challenge. This problem stems from the expectation that the dog needs to bark if something suspicious is happening. As noted above, the counterfactual is that if the dog did not bark, it means something. However, inspired by this analogy we can also create a third cluster: a situation where the dog did not bark, but should have. While this can be seen as a subcategory of the dog that did not bark problem, the counterfactual here is different. Unlike the original, in which the dog had no reason to bark, in this situation, if the dog were aware of the occurrence, then it would definitely be barking. Nonetheless, the dog that should have barked problem also differs from the dog that did bark problem. The dog that did bark points to a situation in which the occurrence is known but its meaning is not. In the dog that should have barked, not only is the interpretation unclear, but what happened remains a mystery.\n\nFor the purpose of the study of deterrence, this analogy emphasizes situations in which practitioners are unaware of what happened, or at least of situations that have no public record.7 This means that scholars are limited in using these cases. Not only are they unaware of cases of deterrence success (as evident in the dog that did not bark problem), but they may also be unaware of cases of deterrence failure.\n\n## Current Solutions in Scholarship\n\nThe dog that did not bark and what I term the dog that did bark point to three main challenges in the study of deterrence: (1) bias in case selection; (2) difficulty of determining deterrence success and deterrence failure, and thus of classifying case studies; and (3) problems in establishing causality, that is, in showing that there is not only a correlation between the issuing of the threats and the avoidance of violence, but that the deterrent threat causes it (George and Smoke 1974, 90–93; Luke 1989, 214; Lebow and Stein 1990, 345; Freedman 2004, 13). Scholars offer a number of solutions to these challenges.\n\nFirst, scholars urge careful selection of case studies. Among other things, they recommend exploring critical case studies of deterrence failure (Lebow and Stein 1989, 221–22). In addition, Huth and Russett suggest focusing on immediate deterrence rather than on cases of general deterrence. Immediate deterrence is characterized by explicit threats or the movement of alerting military forces, and thus it provides the observer with “reasonable assessment of whether deterrence succeeded or failed” (Huth and Russett 1988, 30). Also, they suggest examining cases of both deterrence failure and deterrence success (Huth and Russett 1990,\n\ninvolvement in Syria since 2012 and especially since 2013, and the pressure from Iran not to waste resources (Lupovici 2016b, 183).\n\n7These situations usually result from what Baliga, Bueno De Mesquita, and Wolitzky (2020, 1055) refer to as detection failure, where defenders are unaware that an attack occurred.",

However, as Jervis asserts, this solution is limited, as the important question is why deterrence fails and not the frequency of deterrence failures (Jervis 1989, 194).\n\nSecond, scholars suggest examining the long-term dynamics of enduring rivals to address a number of challenges in the study of deterrence (Stein 1996; Lieberman 2013; Danilovic and Clare 2017, 14–15). This enables the exploration not only of immediate deterrence, but also of general deterrence. Morgan (2003, 82) suggests that focusing only on crises is problematic since it prevents studying the inter-crises periods, which are crucial because actors often attempt to employ general deterrence strategy. Focusing on enduring rivals also addresses the bias in studying mainly cases of deterrence failure. It helps to establish the causal connections by addressing questions around whether the challenger seriously considered war or, if the challenger backed down, whether it was affected by the defender’s deterrent strategy. In addition, it helps to establish a more focused comparison because the same actors are examined over time. Finally, studying enduring rivals also addresses the challenge of identifying the defender and the challenger, by revealing shifts in actors’ balance of interests (Lieberman 2013, 29–32; see also Stein 1996).\n\nThird, scholars suggest dealing with the challenge of identifying deterrence success by developing hypotheses about the defender, the challenger, and the conflict (Stern, Axelrod, Jervis, and Rander 1989, 6, 19–21, 33). While this solution complements some other solutions, it leads in practice to debates around results without necessarily providing convincing explanations. A prime example of these limitations is the study of whether the actual use of force contributes to enhancing a deterrent posture and demonstrating resolve (Schelling 1966, 116–25; Mercer 1996; Press 2005; Tang 2005; Rid 2012, 128; Lupton 2018, 61–66). This issue is highly debated, and scholars suggest the empirical findings on it are inconclusive and that further research is needed (Huth 1997; Sartori 2005, 9; Weisiger and Yarhi-Milo 2015, 479).\n\nFourth, scholars have advised relying on primary sources and detailed historical accounts to better determine the defender and challenger and to better establish deterrence success (or failure). This will also decrease selection bias in the study of deterrence (Lebow and Stein 1990, 346–51). Following these ideas, Wilner (2011, 32–33), for example, suggests that primary sources are crucial to establishing the putative challenger’s intentions and how they change. While use of primary sources is promising, a common problem is the difficulty of accessing the kind of evidence needed. Leaders’ statements may not be sincere, especially around the effect of the deterrent threat on behavior. As Morgan asserts, the challenger “won’t announce that it backed down because it was scared: instead, it never planned to attack” (Morgan 2003, 122; see also Huth and Russett 1990, 491). Even in private discussions, policymakers tend not to admit the effect of the opponent’s deterrence strategy (Lebow and Stein 1989, 222). The sources that help address this challenge come from closed meetings, classified policy analyses, and military orders and assessments, all of which are hard to trace (Huth and Russett 1990, 491). However, they do provide much stronger evidence of whether and how deterrent threat shapes a putative challenger’s behavior.\n\n## Challenges in Studying Cyber Deterrence\n\nThe challenges around studying conventional and nuclear deterrence are much more pressing in the context of cyber deterrence. Not only do interactions in the\n\n8 An example of using these materials is evident in Golov (2013), who explores the effectiveness of American and Israeli deterrence vis-à-vis Iraq during the Gulf War (1991–1992) based on captured documents.\n\n9 Huth and Russett (1990, 481–82, 491) admit that primary sources provide key evidence for establishing deterrence success. However, they warn that conducting studies based just on such evidence may bias the research, as they are accessible only in a very limited number of cases.",

Among other things, they argue that defending actors cannot easily pose a credible threat because of the difficulty of identifying the challenger, the large number of potential challengers, the asymmetry between the challengers and the defenders, the low entry costs, the limited public support to retaliate against cyberattacks, and the defenders’ difficulty exposing their capabilities (Harknett 1996; Molander, Riddle, and Wilson 1996, 87; Cordesman and Cordesman 2001, 7; Arquilla 2003, 210–13; Libicki 2007, 271–72; Libicki 2009, 1–3, 26, 44–45; Morgan 2010, 55–76; Geers 2011, 111–22; Fischerkeller and Harknett 2017, 386–87; Kreps and Schneider 2019; Fischerkeller, Harknett, and Vičić 2020, 25–30).\n\nIndeed, some scholars suggest various methods to enhance the effectiveness of deterrence strategy in dissuading cyberattacks. Recently, scholars have become more optimistic about achieving this goal. For example, scholars offer innovative ways to think about the implications of the attribution problem and how deterrence can work under imperfect attribution (Glaser 2011, 3; Baliga, Bueno De Mesquita, and Wolitzky 2020). Scholars also suggest that the attribution problem can be addressed in various, mainly technical and technological, ways (e.g., Rid and Buchanan 2014; Egloff and Dunn Cavelty 2021) and therefore should not necessarily prevent the execution of retaliation. Furthermore, the attribution problem is not a challenge for deterrence theory per se, but is shaped through social norms that might be changed over time (Lupovici 2016a).\n\nScholars suggest that, in addition to deterrence by punishment, actors also rely on tailored deterrence; serial and cumulative deterrence; deterrence by denial; deterrence by naming and shaming; deterrence through the development of international norms; and deterrence by detection. Scholars also note that actors could deter by punishment through the threat of using kinetic means, and not just through cyber means (Wheatley and Hayes 1996, 13, 19–20; Cordesman and Cordesman 2001, 7; Kugler 2009; Morgan 2010, 59, 68; Glaser 2011, 4; Stevens 2012; Tor 2017; Nye 2017; Lindsay and Gartzke 2018, 192; Schneider 2019a, 109; Wilner 2020, 253).¹¹ They have also suggested that cyber deterrence is more likely to be effective against a potential cyberattack that is equivalent to armed conflict. This is because in such situations, the impact of the unique characteristics of cyberspace on deterrence will be less pronounced (Fischerkeller, Harknett, and Vičić 2020, 29).\n\nWhile debates continue, these scholars emphasize the theoretical questions—whether and when cyber deterrence may work—and offer policy implications. Nonetheless, less attention is given to methodological questions and challenges around studying these issues, and to how evidence should be collected and analyzed.\n\n¹⁰ For a review of this scholarship, see Nye (2017); Mandel (2017, 43–64); Wilner (2020, 251–56).\n\n¹¹ Cooper (2012, 111–18) suggests the concept of *network deterrence*. He argues that the combination of means such as punishment, futility, and dependency could strengthen deterrence effectiveness when defenders and putative challengers share a network.",

In fact, the limited access to data and the limited evidence available to scholars result in greater research bias. This is not necessarily a problem for specific studies that focus on a small number of prominent case studies. However, it is a challenge to the scholarship as a whole. As Valeriano and Maness observe, “[c]omparative case studies are rare, given the tendency to focus on events that might be outliers,” such as Estonia (2007), Stuxnet (2010), and Sony Hack (2014), leaving aside typical cyber interactions (Valeriano and Maness 2018, 260). These overlooked interactions may include cases of deterrence success.\n\nThe research, then, not only tends to examine cases of deterrence failure, but also focuses on a limited number of cases. Methodologically, it is not clear to what extent these cases represent the general “population” of cases of cyber deterrence. For example, the reason that led to the availability of the case for deterrence scholars may also have affected the deterrence outcome. Given the secrecy that surrounds many cyberattack incidents, known cases of deterrence failures may indicate situations in which resolute actors chose to challenge.\n\n### The Dog That Did Bark\n\nThis problem concerns how scholars interpret observations: the challenge of establishing whether a certain case is a deterrence failure or success and thus of establishing the causal mechanism of deterrence failure/success. The secrecy around cyber incidents and the limited information available to scholars exacerbate the challenges in deterrence research (see also Burton 2018, 6; Healey and Jenkins 2019, 125). These challenges include actors’ tendency to see themselves as the defender (and not the challenger) and the difficulty of developing a more nuanced classification of deterrence success/failure: one that is not dichotomic but acknowledges that deterrence failure and deterrence success are on a continuum. In a similar way, a significant challenge is to determine what constitutes deterrence failure. While in the kinetic domains, scholars, practitioners, and law experts have over many years developed an understanding of this, it is still debated in the cyber domain (e.g., Schmitt 2017). This further complicates the academic community’s ability to interpret deterrence failure and success, and to classify cases.\n\nThe challenge of identifying relevant cases not only creates selection bias, but also complicates the ability to determine the impact of the deterrent threat on the putative challenger’s behavior. This difficulty is shaped by the combination of the limitation of available information on cyberattacks and the characteristics of cyberattacks, which make the temporality of the attack a key issue. In kinetic domains, the timing of the attack and of the damage is similar; and in most cases, damage follows shortly after the attack’s execution. For example, it takes a few minutes for an intercontinental missile to hit its target, and damage will follow and start impacting the defender usually less than an hour after the initiation of the attack. Because of the various modes and stages of executing cyberattacks, on the other hand, scholars have to distinguish between the timing of the attack and the timing of the damage (e.g., Brantly and Smeets forthcoming, 4–5). Challengers can better control the timing of the attack. They can predetermine the attack or use the original attack as a platform for future attacks. This increased difficulty in identifying the deterrent threat’s timing and its influence on the putative challenger’s behavior makes study of it much more onerous. Furthermore, it raises a crucial question about the meaning of deterrence success: that is, whether executing an attack can be considered deterrence failure if the damage has yet to occur. All of this inhibits our ability to interpret deterrence success or to classify cases of deterrence failure and success.",

While the dog that did not bark emphasizes the problems stemming from being unable to observe cases of deterrence success, this problem emphasizes problems stemming from being unable to clearly observe cases of deterrence failure.\n\nIn other domains, the execution of an attack leaves traces and evidence that scholars can use. These traces help scholars to determine the case as deterrence failure, as well as to examine aspects related to the execution of the challenge: for example, the damage, how it was done, and by whom. In contrast, cyberattacks usually leave fewer traces. In fact, even a significant cyberattack may not be easily traced. For example, a cyberattack may target the electricity grid but be masked as an accident or a failure of the system (see also Schneider 2019a, 114). Furthermore, in some cases, the effectiveness of cyberattacks requires that they will remain untraced. In the well-known case of Stuxnet, the worm aimed not only to damage Iranian centrifuges, but also to confuse the Iranian scientists regarding the sources of the problem (Farwell and Rohozinski 2012, 115).\n\nWhile the research on cyber deterrence focuses on the problem of attribution—a situation in which the source of an attack is unknown—a key difficulty concerns a more fundamental challenge: the ability to detect that there was an attack in the first place. Brantly, for example, notes that in the cyber domain it is more important “to identify that an attack is occurring . . . than to in the moment identify who is actually conducting the attack” (Brantly 2016, 87). Moreover, regardless of whether or not the victim is aware of the attack, it is a challenge for scholars, who often have limited access to such information. For this reason, some scholars state their main focus is to study compelling success rather than deterrence success. Valeriano, Jensen, and Maness (2018, 24) suggest that “[o]ur choice to focus on compelling is driven by the need to examine the efficacy of operations that seek to achieve demonstrable effects. Compreciency is about changing behavior, while deterrence is about preventing behaviors, the latter being difficult to observe empirically.”\n\n# The Limitations of Current Solutions\n\nThe solutions put forward to address challenges in studying deterrence have advanced deterrence research, but they have encountered some difficulties. Applying them to cyber deterrence studies, that focus on exploring deterrence success/failure, creates additional problems, given the unique characteristics of cyber deterrence and how knowledge around cyber incidents and cyber deterrence is produced. While common solutions may become more effective in the future, as technology changes and reliable information on cyber incidents increases, they are currently quite limited.\n\nOne direction for a solution is to acquire data and conduct quantitative studies based on it. While a few scholars have started to use these methods to examine cyber deterrence success or closely related behavior with interesting findings (e.g., Brantly 2016; Pytlak and Mitchell 2016),[12] they have also pointed to challenges in using data to this end (e.g., Valeriano, Jensen, and Maness 2018, 24). Others also indicate the need to develop new ways to use data given the challenges of studying this strategy (Pytlak and Mitchell 2016, 79).\n\nBecause of the challenges of studying cyber deterrence, it is difficult to employ the solutions discussed above based on careful selection of specific case studies—that is, focusing on critical case studies and immediate deterrence and exploring\n\n[12] For example, Brantly’s (2016, 143–49) findings support the assertions that actors’ ability to maintain anonymity enhances the chances for deterrence failure. Nonetheless, Pytlak and Mitchell are unable to establish significant correlation and in the end reach inconclusive interpretations of the evidence (Pytlak and Mitchell 2016, 73–79).",

These solutions cannot fully resolve the challenges of determining cyber incidents and identifying and classifying situations of cyber deterrence failure and success. Jervis (1989, 194) has warned that explaining deterrence failure and success is more important than explaining their frequency; this caution is even more important in studying cyber deterrence given that the cases scholars are able to examine are more biased. The challenges of case selection stem not only from the dog that did not bark problem, but also from the dog that did bark and the dog that should have barked problems—biasing cases both of deterrence success and of deterrence failure.\n\nLikewise, focusing on cases of immediate deterrence also becomes a challenge when studying cyber deterrence, mainly because of the lack of available information and the characteristics of cyberattacks themselves. Scholars must distinguish the time of the attack, the time of its damage, the time the defender acknowledges the attack (and the damage), and the time the attack becomes public knowledge.¹³ The defender itself may be unaware that it needs to employ an immediate deterrence threat. For example, in contrast to other domains, preparations for attacks in the cyber domain leave less traces compared to preparations of kinetic attacks and thus complicate the ability of deterrer actors to pose an immediate deterrent threat. This means that examining cases of immediate deterrence is of limited help in studying cyber deterrence: actors have fewer opportunities to perform this strategy, the existence of known cases of immediate cyber deterrence may be biased,¹⁴ and, most importantly, scholars may not have access to full information on these cases.\n\nSolutions put forward to better establish the causal connection between the deterrent threat and the challenger behavior face similar challenges. Along with the problems discussed (case selection and identification of deterrence failure and success, which also limit establishing the \"explanation\") is the limited available information on the case studies. This makes additional potential solutions impractical, such as the relying on primary sources. Likewise, while studying enduring rivals could address some of the challenges around establishing causal connections (as well as eliminating biases in case selection), it is questionable whether such enduring rivals and conflicts in the cyber domain exist, or whether scholars can acquire enough relevant information about them to allow such research. Cyber deterrence scholars, therefore, experience significant challenges because of difficulties identifying cases of deterrence success or failure. While these problems accompany the study of deterrence in general—both quantitative and qualitative works—they are worse in the study of cyber deterrence and intensify other challenges. Under these conditions, researchers need to go back to the same case studies, in this way possibly missing other important factors affecting the practices of deterrence.\n\n## Toward a Methodology for Studying Cyber Deterrence\n\nThe challenges discussed above, and the limited applicability of current solutions to address them, increase the attractiveness of an alternative methodological solution to explore cyber deterrence. While, it is impossible to fully resolve all the challenges in the study of cyber deterrence, this article provides some directions toward this goal. I advance a solution based on studying the adoption of cyber deterrence strategy. By the adoption of cyber deterrence strategy, I refer to one of two things: (1) a strategic change, in which an actor moves toward a decision to rely on at least one type of cyber deterrence strategy (e.g., punishment, denial, detection),\n\n¹³On policy decisions to reveal or conceal experiencing cyberattacks, see Baram and Sommer (2019).\n\n¹⁴Given how difficult it is for the defender to identify the need to issue an immediate cyber deterrence threat, the fact that a defender successfully identifies this need may itself affect its ability to issue a successful deterrent threat. Whereas in other domains the putative challenger may also attempt to disguise its attempt to attack, defender actors have more means to identify it prior to the attack.",

In both cases, the adoption of a cyber deterrence strategy can also refer to a shift in how the strategy of deterrence is practiced.\n\nStudying the adoption of deterrence strategies has not been given enough scholarly attention. Indeed, my exploration of this phenomenon overlaps with various studies on different types of deterrence strategies (e.g., nuclear, conventional).¹⁵ Some scholars, as noted above, have even started to specifically study cyber deterrence adoption (Kugler 2009, 311–13; Stevens 2012; Adamsky 2018; Healey 2019; Gold 2020, 8–21; Wilner 2020). Nonetheless, few of these studies theorize this adoption, being more interested in the historical process through which deterrence was embraced.¹⁶ Furthermore, these scholars do not see research on adoption of the strategy as a methodological solution to challenges in studying deterrence.\n\nIn contrast, I suggest focusing on the adoption of deterrence strategy as a way to address the methodological challenges of studying (cyber) deterrence. Such a focus allows scholars to explore the various ways actors adopt this strategy and to apply different methods to ascertain this phenomenon and explain it. But before detailing the advantages of studying the adoption and employment of deterrence strategies, it is useful to categorize them. For example, the various ways actors adopt cyber deterrence strategies can be categorized based on the threat they aim to dissuade and their types, means, and degrees of explicitness.\n\n## The Undesired Activity to Be Deterred\n\nActors can use cyber deterrence to deter threats not only in the cyber domain but also in other domains. In the former, the strategy of cyber deterrence can be used to deter different types of cyber threats that vary in intensity, complexity, and feasibility (e.g., Brantly 2016, 116–17; Burton 2018, 28–29). Brantly, for example, distinguishes three main categories of activities actors attempt to deter: cyberattacks, cyber espionage, and cyber theft (Brantly 2020, 8–9).¹⁷ Defending actors may also develop a cross-domain deterrence strategy to dissuade threats conducted through cyber space that target supply chains or critical infrastructures or that may affect military activities and effectiveness (Schneider 2019a, 103, 108–9).\n\nOther categories of employing cyber deterrence strategy concern the use of cyber means to dissuade attacks in kinetic domains (Lupovici 2016a, 325). For example, cyber means may bolster conventional deterrence (Schneider 2019a, 115–19, but see Libicki 2016, 281). In a similar way, cyber means may affect nuclear deterrence. Some scholars estimate that advances in artificial intelligence may undermine nuclear deterrence (Lieber and Press 2017, 10; Horowitz 2019, 782; Johnson 2020, 429–38). However, others who study developments in Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA), including the advancement of autonomous machines and computerized devices, point to how in some situations these systems may enhance deterrence vis-à-vis different kinds of kinetic attacks (Fortmann and Von Hlatky 2009, 309–12).\n\nA related question about the type of threat is the specific phase of the cyberattack defenders wish to deter. Brantly and Smeets (forthcoming, 4–5) distinguish among different stages of cyberattack, such as the penetration of the defender’s system to\n\n¹⁵ Some scholars indirectly refer to the adoption of the strategy while studying “deterrence success” as part of operationalizing deterrence threat. For example, in defining the issuing of an immediate extended deterrent threat, Huth and Russett argue that scholars need to focus on “observable behavioral indicators in the form of statements and military actions that signal the threat to use force if the protégé is attacked.” According to them, even if this is a bluff, it is part of practicing deterrence (Huth and Russett 1990, 488). However, their goal of operationalizing the issuing of the deterrent threat is to establish covariance as part of explaining deterrence success.\n\n¹⁶ This type of approach is clearly evident in Freedman and Michaels’ (2019) seminal book on the evolution of nuclear strategies in different periods of time and in different countries.\n\n¹⁷ In addition, scholars refer to more specific challenges, such as deterring the use of information warfare through cyber platforms (Whyte 2020b, 237–39).",

Currently, in addition to deterrence by punishment, scholars tend to emphasize the following types of cyber deterrence strategies: tailored deterrence (Kugler 2009), punctuated/cumulative deterrence (Kello 2017; Tor 2017, 205–11), deterrence by denial (Iasiello 2013; Libicki 2016, 268–70; Nye 2017, 56–7), deterrence by detection or by accusation (Lindsay and Gartzke 2018, 192; Finnemore and Hollis 2020, 980–81), and deterrence by naming and shaming and through development of international norms (Nye 2017, 60–62; Stevens 2012; see also Libicki 2009, 68).\n\n## The Deterrent Means\n\nNot only can actors adopt different types of cyber deterrence strategies, but they can also employ each strategy with different means. For example, deterrence by punishment may be based not only on the defender’s cyber means, but also on its economic, diplomatic, and kinetic means (e.g., Kugler 2009, 328; Jasper 2017, 95–96; Schneider 2019a). In a similar way, actors can employ deterrence by denial not only by communicating their defensive means, but also by communicating their means to avoid the damage, such as by establishing backup systems to ensure the resilience of the information infrastructures (see also Nye 2017, 57).\n\n## Degree of Explicitness\n\nWhether and how actors publicly declare they will respond to a challenge is fundamental to understanding these practices in any domain of conflict (Brantly 2016, 113). Given the fact that communicating threats is a core element of deterrence strategy, the degree of explicitness is a key characteristic of how cyber deterrence strategy is adopted and employed. Deterrent threats are communicated through a wide spectrum of expressions—ranging from full explicitness to lack of any reference to the deterrent threat—that contain three main elements:\n\nOne element is how the threat is articulated and directed at an opponent: for example, whether the threat is generally stated in a strategic document (e.g., Department of Defense 2011) or the defender targets specific opponents (e.g., Department of Defense 2018, 1).\n\nA second element is how explicitly the undesired activity the defender wants to prevent is communicated. Scholars have debated over this issue when studying deterrence in other domains, contemplating whether a red line should be clearly stated or not (e.g., Lockhart 1978, 548–51; Schelling 1981, 38–41).\n\nA third element is the extent to which the deterrent threat itself is communicated. Actors differ in how explicitly they present the consequences that will stem from the challenger’s undesired activity: whether, for example, the defender specifies the retaliatory punishment or only presents it generally. A number of US documents have stated that the United States preserves the right to retaliate against a cyberattack with all the means they hold (Department of Defense 2011, 2; Department of Defense 2013, 32, 41–42; see also in Healey 2019; and in Wilner 2020). While some argue that actors can achieve a deterrent effect by specifying what a retaliatory strike will include (to a specific challenger) (e.g., Kugler 2009, 331–32), others suggest that states often issue a more general threat, using ambiguity as a mechanism of deterrence (e.g., Brantly 2016, 114). Conversely, actors may refrain from explicitly",

They may choose to contain attacks in order to avoid further escalation and may consider a deterrent strategy as inadequate to address the challenges. Actors may also retaliate without issuing a deterrent threat prior to their response.\n\nOther possibilities exist between full explicitness and non-explicitness in communicating deterrent threats. Kugler (2009, 311–3), for example, reviews key US documents since 2003 and concludes that while they acknowledge the need to develop cyber deterrence strategy, they do not elaborate on how it can be attained.¹⁸ Likewise, actors, such as in the Israeli case, may discuss the need to adopt a strategy of cyber deterrence or wish to develop such a strategy but refrain from directly and explicitly issuing deterrent threats. In the last decade, senior Israeli policymakers have made the point that Israel should acquire a cyber deterrence strategy. For example, when serving as minister of defense, Ehud Barak suggested that in the uncertainty that cyber capabilities create, “leadership is required to show the way as to how to do the right thing for Israel and to establish a deterrent balance” (Barak 2012). Prime Minister Netanyahu also explained the need to develop a cyber deterrence strategy despite the fact that “[t]he ability to deter is more difficult because the source of such an attack is more anonymous. This is a problem we will certainly have to address” (Netanyahu 2011).\n\nInterestingly, in May 2020, it seems that Israel has moved to adopt an even more explicit cyber deterrence strategy when its retaliation against targets in Iran in response to a cyberattack on water infrastructures in Israel was reported (Warrick and Nakashima 2020). The publication of the Israeli retaliation, as well as other statements made by Israeli officials such as by Minister of Defense, Naftali Bennett, were interpreted as an attempt of Israel to send deterrent messages to the Iranians and to draw a red line (Siman Tov and Even 2020).\n\nSending deterrent messages through acts of retaliation is closely related to the concepts of punctuated deterrence and cumulative deterrence, where the actual use of force aims to punish and deliver a threatening message over a long period of time (Kello 2017, 205–11; Tor 2017). Even before the incidents of May 2020, some experts interpreted Israel’s offensive cyber capabilities in this context, claiming they aim in part to deter potential challengers and “show potential attackers what Israel is able to do if it chooses to respond to an attack” (Cohen, Freilich and Siboni 2016, 313).\n\nSome degree of explicitness—and thus communication and signaling—is a crucial aspect of these practices. According to Kello (2017, 209), “Diplomatic and signaling procedures will be required to demonstrate to adversaries that for the purpose of punishment, individual hostile actions are regarded as a comprehensive package of offensive activity rather than being disparate actions that merit isolated responses.” Likewise, as Tor (2017, 107) asserts, just the use of force is insufficient in creating a cumulative cyber deterrent strategy, as there is also a need to “to outline the ‘rules of the game’ in a clear way.”¹⁹\n\n## Advantages in Focusing on Adoption of Cyber Deterrence Strategy\n\nFocusing on the adoption and employment of cyber deterrence has a number of theoretical and methodological advantages: it diversifies research by highlighting an overlooked phenomenon, it invites plural approaches and methods that help to better explain and understand actors’ behavior, and it thus emphasizes\n\n¹⁸ In this respect, comparing US documents reveals a growing specification of cyber deterrence strategies over the years (e.g., in Kugler 2009, 311–13).\n\n¹⁹ Examples of less explicit messages that serve deterrent goals can be found in leaking of information around cyberattacks—such as Stuxnet, the corruption of Syria’s air defense system, the Chinese penetration of American health insurer files, and the Russian hack into the US Democratic Party files (Perkovich and Levite 2017, 273; see also Mazanec and Thayer 2014, 69).",

While to some extent these advantages could also be achieved by diverting the study around cyber deterrence failure/success to these directions, the main advantage lies in the observability that studying the adoption of the strategy allows. Not only does this advantage stand by its own in improving our understanding of the practices of cyber deterrence, but it also enhances the other advantages: diversification of the research and the use of plural methods.\n\n## Observability\n\nThe main advantage of studying the adoption and employment of deterrence strategy is the ability to trace empirical evidence of it. The idea behind a strategy of deterrence, as discussed above, is to issue and communicate threats. The communication can be more or less explicit—and can even be a bluff; however, it is a crucial part of practicing this strategy.\n\nEven if the deterrent threat is a bluff,²⁰ the methodological solution based on studying the adoption and employment of (cyber) deterrent strategy cannot be dismissed based on an assertion that issuing deterrent threats is cheap talk. Given the cult of reputation and practitioners' worry about resolve (e.g., Tang 2005; Kertzer 2016),²¹ a defender may find it costly to not execute the deterrent threat or retaliate in case the undesired attack has been made by the putative challenger. They may fear that other actors will challenge them in the future because of the alleged demonstration of weakness. Actors thus are likely to take the adoption of cyber deterrence strategy and the issuing of deterrent threat seriously; issuing deterrent threats, therefore, provides indications of an actor's strategy.\n\nFocusing on observable indications allows scholars to address challenges in the study of cyber deterrence that stem from limited access to details around practicing cyber deterrence that in many cases remain unknown, such as the attack, the damage, and when the defender identified it was attacked. First, the problem of the dog that did not bark and the problem of the dog that should have barked become less pressing. Focusing on strategy adoption and the issuing of deterrent threat involves observing changes in the behavior of the defender actor. From this perspective, and as further discussed below, scholars can study nuances in strategy adoption, conduct comparisons among actors and over time, and explain this phenomenon regardless of the putative challenger's behavior or of the deterrence strategy outcomes. In other words, the research will not be biased toward studying specific cases of deterrence failure.\n\nStudying cyber deterrence strategy adoption also addresses challenges around the dog that did bark problem. By focusing mainly on the behavior of the defender actor, scholars have much less difficulty in interpretation, as the outcome to be examined and explained is less ambiguous. Indeed, scholars may debate over whether an actor actually adopted a cyber deterrence strategy, how it differs from its previous strategies, and about its specific elements. However, because adopting and employing a strategy of deterrence requires some degree of explicitness—unlike deterrence successes and even cyber deterrence failures—scholars also have much more access to empirical evidence to discuss and dispute.\n\n²⁰ Likewise, as Libicki (2016, 227) and Tor (2017, 107) note actors may deliver their deterrent messages not only in public channels but also in secret ones. While for scholars the delivering of deterrent messages secretly poses difficulties of observing and studying the occurrences, actors have incentives to make some public manifestations of the deterrent threat they issue, even indirectly, in order to target larger audiences. In addition, the focus of the suggested methodology is on the strategy, and not necessarily on the communication of a specific threat to a certain opponent. For example, in theory, a cyber deterrence strategy may be adopted explicitly, but the explicit strategic document may also acknowledge that in some situations the communication of the deterrent threat will be delivered privately.\n\n²¹ For further discussion of costly signals, cheap talk, and deterrence, see Fearon (2002, 13–16), Lupton (2018, 64), but also see Danilovic (2002, 130–40).",

First, scholars have pointed in different ways to the need to selectively choose case studies, such as studying critical cases of deterrence failure, or studying enduring rivals. While the main solution this article offers is somewhat different—focusing on the adoption/employment of the strategy—in fact, these solutions complement each other: for example, exploring the adoption, changes, and abandoning of cyber deterrence strategies over time between enduring rivals.\n\nOther solutions have aimed to better establish the causal mechanism (of deterrence success). Because of the observability of both cyber deterrence adoption and the elements that may account for it, the solution of developing specific hypotheses about the defender, the challenger, and the situation is useful direction to take. Scholars can observe the characteristics of cyber deterrence strategy adoption (e.g. explicitness, timing, the type of the cyber deterrence, the means to establish it, and the kind of challenge it aims to dissuade). In a similar way, scholars can provide various factors affecting such adoption, including elements of perceptions, culture, and norms on the one hand, and the strategic utility of the strategy on the other. Likewise, as further discussed below, they may explore the social context in which the strategy is embedded.\n\nFocusing on the adoption of the strategy is closely related to another solution advised by traditional deterrence scholars—that is, to rely on primary sources. Strategy adoption, being observable, provides sources to empirically establish the study of cyber deterrence. However, focusing on adoption also opens up other types of sources. Strategic documents establish the employment of the strategy, such as the US Department of Defense Cyberspace Policy Report, Department of Defense Defense Science Board, and the Department of Defense Cyber Strategy. Other relevant sources help to understand and explain how actors adopt cyber deterrence strategy, in this way exploring the various elements presented above. For example, primary documents that trace how perceptions on cyber (domain) change over time and how the cyber (domain) is constructed (e.g. in Raymond 2019, 203--35) could provide an account of changes in actors' willingness to employ this strategy in the cyber domain.\n\nThe methodological solution I propose—focusing on the adoption and employment of the strategy rather on deterrence success—provides important indications of actors' perceptions of the strategy's effectiveness. Scholars can explore specific cases and conduct longitudinal and cross-sectional comparisons of actors who adopt (or refrain from adopting) cyber deterrence strategy. For example, a growing international tendency to rely on this strategy may imply increasing effectiveness of the strategy or at least an increase in the perception of its effectiveness. Indeed, there are different explanations as to why actors adopt and employ a strategy of (cyber) deterrence—and these should be explored. Nonetheless, given the limited access to information about deterrence success, solutions based on focusing on the strategy's adoption provide important alternatives.\n\nTechnological developments provide one explanation (or hypothesis) for the adoption of cyber deterrence strategy. For example, given the problem of attribution, technologies that help defenders trace the source of an attack may enhance this strategy's efficiency and hence its attractiveness. In a similar way, improvements in defensive measures, measures to increase resilience, and organization skills in operating these measures (Slayton 2017, 89--90, e.g. Matania and Tal-Shir 2020) may make strategies of deterrence by denial more attractive. While these are plausible hypotheses, we cannot reduce the adoption of (cyber) deterrence strategies to technological advancement. Other explanations could be developed, for example,",

            "markdown": "A Methodology for Cyber Deterrence Research\n\nbased on actors' (strategic) culture (e.g., Knopf 2013, 9–10).²³ A number of reviews of cyber security policies and strategies of different countries (e.g., Luijjf, Besseling, Spoelstra, and De Graaf 2013; Liveri and Sarri 2014; Baezner and Cordey 2019) provide not only the social context of cyber deterrence strategies, but also information to help explain their adoption (or lack thereof). The strategic, political, and cultural elements these reports review are useful points of departure toward that goal.\n\nInternational norms could also affect the adoption of cyber deterrence strategy. Nye, for example, suggests that deterrence through the establishment of international norms is one means of employing cyber deterrence. This strategy is based on creating taboos that increase the costs of attacking certain cyber targets (e.g., civilian cyber infrastructures) (Nye 20167, 60–62). From this perspective, the emergence of norms incentivizes actors to rely on practices of deterrence and adopt and employ them. Furthermore, the emergence of new norms can also affect other types of deterrence strategy, including deterrence by punishment. Actors may be more motivated to adopt such a strategy, for example, if cyberattacks are constructed as acts of violence. Seeing a challenge as “violent” increases an actor’s willingness to employ threats to dissuade it, thus enhancing deterrence effectiveness. The existence of a norm that portrays cyberattacks in this way legitimizes a retaliatory strike and thus the adoption of this strategy in the first place (Lupovici 2016a, 333–34).²⁴ In recent years, scholars have begun to explore how public perceptions of cyber conflicts and dynamics affect support for retaliation against cyberattacks (Kreps and Schneider 2019; Shandler, Gross, and Canetti 2021). Public attitudes open up a broad area for research connecting normative, political, and institutional factors that also affect the adoption of cyber deterrence strategies.\n\n## Diversifying Cyber Deterrence Research\n\nBy focusing on the strategy’s adoption, we can examine and compare various kinds of actors, especially actors other than those commonly examined. In particular, the United States is overrepresented in the research. There are a number of reasons for this—including that many scholars are American and aim to influence the US strategy, that the United States is considered a cyber power, and the greater availability of American documents. Therefore, US cyber deterrence will probably continue to be closely examined.\n\nHowever, the observability of the adoption and employment of the strategy makes information on other cases also relatively accessible, which may help to fill the gap and advance our understanding of other countries. One of the research puzzles concerns actors who have not adopted an explicit cyber deterrence strategy—Israel being a key example. Despite the fact that deterrence is a strategy Israel has adopted vis-à-vis various threats (Lupovici 2016b), so far Israel has refrained from issuing direct cyber deterrent threats.\n\nDiversifying the research to include other states is also intriguing given the differing views on the strategy of deterrence and cyber security. Studying whether and how these actors adopt and employ cyber deterrence strategies helps to develop a more nuanced understanding of what cyber deterrence is and why and how it is used.\n\nWe can also extend the study of cyber deterrence to explore non-state actors. In recent years, deterrence scholarship has started to acknowledge other actors involved in the practices of deterrence (Paul, Morgan, and Wirtz 2009). Scholars have explored not only how states attempt to deter non-states threats (e.g., Wilner 2015, 37–74), but also how different kinds of non-state actors, such as terrorist\n\n²³I discuss below some more specific cultural explanations for adopting a strategy of deterrence.\n\n²⁴For further discussion on the question of “violence,” use of force, cyberattacks, and legitimate retaliation, see Waxman (2011), Harrison Dinniss (2012, 63–75), Schmitt (2017, chapter 14, 16), and Schneider (2019a, 115).",

Emerging research on the cyber domain acknowledged the increasing importance of non-state actors in world politics, specifically in international security (Carr 2011; Valeriano and Maness 2015, 164–87; Maurer 2018). However, these notions have rarely been used to explore non-state cyber actors’ involvement in the practices of deterrence, especially their adoption of deterrent strategy and issuing of deterrent threats (but see Teplinsky 2013, 319–21; Burton 2018, 18–21, 23–25; Wilner 2020, 268, 272–73, Lilli 2021). It may be difficult to access this information; however, it will be more accessible than direct information on cases of cyber deterrence successes these actors are involved in.\n\n## Inviting Plural Research Methods\n\nThe study of the adoption and employment of cyber deterrence strategies invites positivist and interpretative methods. Positivist scholars can study causal mechanisms of this phenomenon through quantitative and qualitative methods. Scholars can focus on specific case studies or conduct longitudinal and cross-sectional comparative works on actors who adopted, were late to adopt, or did not adopt cyber deterrence strategy.\n\nFocusing on adoption is a promising direction for examining whether, how, and why an actor adopts and employs a certain type of cyber deterrence strategy. One option is to explore the evolution of the strategy: for example, by tracing a shift in a state’s cyber strategy. The changes in 2018 in US cyber policy provide a useful demonstration of these dynamics, illustrating the advantages of the suggested framework. In 2018, the United States adopted a cyber strategy based on *defend forward* and *persistent engagement* (e.g., compare Department of Defense 2011 with Department of Defense 2018; see also Healey 2019; Kosseff 2019, 5; Wilner 2020, 266–67). While there is debate over how far this strategy diverts from an emphasis on deterrence, experts ascribe the shift to the limited applicability of deterrence strategy in the cyber domain (e.g., Fischerkeller and Harknett 2017; see also King and Gallagher 2020, 27–28).²⁵\n\nThis policy change led to some interesting questions. Foremost, the timing of this shift is worth exploring. Doubts over the effectiveness of cyber deterrence strategy were expressed as early as the 1990s. This implies that the 2018 change was informed by notions beyond those of the limitations of cyber deterrence strategy—for example, by the acknowledgment that adversaries in cyber space are in constant contact (e.g., Fischerkeller and Harknet 2017; Fischerkeller, Harknett, and Vičić 2020, 25–30). This shows that acceptance of new ideas and their successful promotion by individuals and networks may also be crucial in accounting for this change. Healey suggests that the change “stems directly from this Goldman–Fischerkeller–Harknett lineage (and subsequently drove the DoD Cyber Strategy and parts of the White House National Cyber Strategy). This is perhaps unsurprising “as all three are international relations scholars who have worked at US Cyber Command” (Healey 2019, 5). Processes of learning, persuasion, and individual characteristics can all help to explain whether and how cyber deterrence strategy is shifting, accepted, and employed.²⁶\n\nLearning may be also seen as a result of cyberattacks experienced by the United States, which led practitioners to emphasize the need to shift to persistent engagement. Whyte (2020a, 210–11) summarizes this point: “[N]umerous commentators . . . note the significance of Russian political warfare in 2016 as a realisation mo\n\n²⁵ Likewise, Libicki concludes that the United States should not make cyber deterrence an explicit strategy and that it should not rely on it (Libicki 2016, 266).\n\n²⁶ For similar dynamics regarding learning nuclear deterrence, see Kaplan (1991), Adler (1992), and Evangelista (1999). These studies show, in different ways, that although technological developments are crucial, they are insufficient to account for the adoption of deterrence strategies.",

            "markdown": "A Methodology for Cyber Deterrence Research\n\nment prompting the development of the new, more assertive strategy.” Structural changes also allowed for and guided this shift. For example, comparing the 2018 cyber strategy with its predecessor (DoD 2015), Kollars and Schneider (2018) note “The 2018 Cyber Strategy reflects the changes in the political, technical, and institutional environment over the last three years.”\n\nAnother research direction that focuses on the adoption of the strategy could examine the exact nature, rather the efficiency, of the strategy²⁷: that is, examining whether and which type of deterrence strategy the new adopted policy aims to advance. Scholars have debated over whether the 2018 strategy emphasizes deterrence strategy (see, Healey 2019, 3–4). On the one hand, it was developed and justified based on the limits of cyber deterrence as discussed above. For example, Kreps and Schneider (2019, 9) assert that persistent engagement is better suited than deterrence. According to them, “[D]eterrence hinges on public resolve for overwhelming uses of force and a willingness to escalate, which appears lacking in the cyber domain, whereas persistent engagement can operate at a lower intensity of confrontation—albeit one that is relatively continuous—that gains legitimacy by virtue of the public support.”\n\nNonetheless, while experts acknowledge the shift in the US strategy, they also point to different types of deterrence strategy that the new policy emphasizes and to how it might actually enhance the US deterrent posture. For Whyte (2020a, 210), the new strategy marks a shift from deterrence by denial to a kind of deterrence by punishment. Likewise, Kollars and Schneider (2018) identify a specific shift in US strategy toward tailored deterrence against China and Russia, compared with a former comprehensive cyber deterrence strategy vis-à-vis a “wide array of actors and actions.” Furthermore, persistent engagement based on offensive action might strengthen deterrence strategy by signaling resolve and establishing escalation dominance (Kollars and Schneider 2018; Miller and Pollard 2019; Valeriano and Jensen 2019). In a similar way, the US Cyber Command Vision statement implements the idea of persistent engagement as a way to enhance the US deterrent posture. According to this document, “Through persistent action and competing more effectively below the level of armed conflict, we can influence the calculations of our adversaries, deter aggression, and clarify the distinction between acceptable and unacceptable behavior in cyberspace” (USCYBERCOM 2018, 6).\n\nThese discussions demonstrate not only the importance of looking into a cyber (deterrence) strategy, explaining it, and analyzing its components, but also the feasibility of conducting such research. Although, scholars can interpret the evidence differently, and the meaning and implications of the strategy may change over time, there is accessible and important evidence to work with. Furthermore, it helps to demonstrate how the suggested methodology provides an alternative to the challenges of studying deterrence success. While we still have little information about the outcomes of this strategy, we can start by considering the various aspects of its adoption.\n\nIn addition to focusing on one case study or on shifts in actors’ cyber deterrence strategy, such as the those discussed above (the case of Israel response in May 2020 and the 2018 US policy), scholars can also conduct broader comparisons. These can explore the reasons for the differences in how countries adopt and employ cyber deterrence strategies or compare an actor’s adoption and employment of cyber deterrence strategy with its adoption and employment of deterrence strategy\n\n²⁷ The idea of persistent engagement sparked a debate over whether and to what extent cyber operations are effective in attaining strategic goals, and specifically whether and how they contribute to cyber deterrence success. While scholars acknowledged a number of advantages of the new policy, they were also worried that the criteria for success of this new strategy are not entirely clear; that employing it might be too costly; that it might lead to escalation; and that it may deteriorate US relationships with its allies (Healey 2019, 7–11; Lin and Smeets 2019; Miller and Pollard 2019; Smeets 2019a; Schneider 2019b; Smeets 2019b; Valeriano and Jensen 2019).",

Scholars may also look into changes over time in how an actor adopts and employs its cyber deterrence strategy. The deterrent threat and the deterrent means may become more or less explicit, the putative challengers may be named (or not), and over time actors may remove or add means and different methods for practicing cyber deterrence.\n\nAn obvious advantage here is the access to comparable information and data. Scholars, thus, not only can conduct quantitative research that explores different aspects of the adoption of cyber deterrence strategies, but can also use data sets already available. This direction accords with Pytlak and Mitchell’s (2016, 79) recommendation to develop new techniques to address and use data in a way that overcomes the limited “amount of information publicly available.”\n\nBased on the data collected and analyzed by Brantly (2016), Valeriano, Jensen, and Maness (2018), and Kostyuk and Zhukov (2019), scholars are able to develop interesting notions about the adoption of deterrence strategy. For example, following these studies, it is possible to ask whether actors who absorbed significant cyberattacks tend to consider adopting cyber deterrence strategies to balance their insecurities, or whether more powerful actors tend to rely on this strategy, for example, based on long-term deterrence through previous execution of cyber means (i.e., cumulative cyber deterrence).²⁹ These notions fit some of the assertions Valeriano et al. make, such as those about credibility and signaling (Valeriano, Jensen, and Maness 2018, 46–47), as well as about the long-term aims of cyber operations (Valeriano, Jensen, and Maness 2018, 11). Similarly, the cyber power score Brantly (2016, 138–40, 169) develops enables some hypotheses about the adoption of cyber deterrence strategies: for example, whether weaker states tend to adopt deterrence strategies to balance their inferiority (e.g., explicitly adopt the strategy) or to avoid it, fearing that adopting it will contribute to escalation. Based on these data, scholars can also compare whether and why different actors adopt different types of cyber deterrence strategies: for example, whether weaker actors rely on strategies such as deterrence by naming and shaming or deterrence by detection.\n\nThe suggested methodology based on studying the adoption of the strategy not only enables positivistic studies, but may also fit well with interpretative frameworks and research on deterrence. Interpretative scholars who study deterrence have started to employ discourse analysis to examine the practices of deterrence (Cohn 1987; Luke 1989; Dauber 1993; Harrington 2016; Vuori 2016). While these methods have not been fully applied to study cyber deterrence, this could be done through focusing on the adoption and employment of the strategy and on the language used. One specific promising direction is to study the adoption and employment of deterrence as securitizing moves (Lupovici 2019). Scholars have started to explore different securitizing moves related to cyber (Bendrath, Eriksson, and Giacomello 2007; Dunn Cavelty 2008; Hansen and Nissenbaum 2009; Deibert and Rohozinski 2010; Dunn Cavelty 2013; Stevens 2016). Looking into the adoption of cyber deterrence strategy provides intriguing cases to further apply the theory of securitization to traditional security challenges. This direction may cover various securitizing moves: for example, the American attempt to securitize cyber challenges to justify various means of retaliation, including even nuclear weapons, in the case of an “existential cyber attack” (Department of Defense 2013, 42; see also Wilner 2020, 261).\n\nIn a similar way, interpretative approaches highlight the importance of the social context in which deterrence strategy is embedded. These notions can be also ap-\n\n²⁸ One goal of comparing cyber deterrence with deterrence in other domains is to validate the assertion that the adoption of cyber deterrence may indicate, even indirectly, deterrence success, as discussed above.\n\n²⁹ Likewise, reports that document cyber incidents may also prove useful in tracing previous cyber operations and their influence on actors’ adoption of cyber deterrence strategies; see, for example, the project of the Council on Foreign Relations at https://www.cfr.org/cyber-operations.",

This is important to better understand how and why actors adopt cyber deterrence strategies, but also because the way the strategy is adopted indicates and reflects political, normative, and cultural elements. Although scholars have not used these elements to study cyber deterrence adoption (but see Adamsky 2018), they have explained deterrence strategy adoption and employment in other domains by pointing to strategic culture (Basrur 2006, 49–79; Adamsky 2017, 166–71), norms (Tannenwald 2007, 45, 291–92), practices (Adler and Pouliot 2011, 9–15, 21–28), rituals (Mälksoo 2021), and actors' identity, emotions, and ontological security (Tannenwald 2007, 45–46; Lupovici 2016b). The adoption and employment of cyber deterrence strategy provide another arena to examine and employ these theories.\n\n# Conclusions\n\nThis article suggests that focusing on the adoption and employment of cyber deterrence strategy—rather than studying cyber deterrence success—promises to provide solutions to the methodological challenges associated with the study of this strategy. This article does not claim to advance the only way to explore cyber deterrence. On the contrary, scholars may well find methodological alternatives, as there is still need to collect and analyze data and case studies on deterrence failure/success. Nonetheless, based on clarifying methodological challenges and by offering a categorization of different characteristics of how (cyber) deterrence strategies are adopted, I point to a phenomenon that has received insufficient attention, and studying it carries a number of advantages. Among other things, it provides methodological solutions, it helps diversify the research of deterrence, and it invites plural approaches and methods. This paper thus should be seen as a point of departure for further research and as a call to focus on the adoption and employment of the strategy.\n\nMore generally, I suggest that elaborating on these issues contributes not only to the study of cyber deterrence, but also to the two fields of research: deterrence and cyber. For the former, the advantage lies in reframing methodological problems and challenges that may be relevant for scholars who explore not only cyber deterrence. Another advantage for deterrence research, in general, lies in studying an understudied phenomenon. More scholarly work has been done on the adoption and employment of deterrence strategies (mainly of nuclear deterrence, e.g., Kaplan 1991; Adler 1992; Evangelista 1999; Freedman and Michaels 2019) than on the adoption of cyber deterrence strategies. Nonetheless, while the study of deterrence strategy adoption lags behind the study of deterrence success, it may well complement it. From this perspective, this article provides a first step in developing a methodology to study the adoption and employment of different types of deterrence strategies in different domains and with different deterrent means.\n\nThis is, furthermore, an important phenomenon on its own. It may indicate various aspects about actors' strategic thinking, perceptions, culture, and identity. Understanding how, when, and why actors adopt and employ deterrence strategies (or change or abandon them) in various domains may also further the study of cyber deterrence adoption and employment. The study of more traditional strategies of deterrence may reveal additional explanations and possible characteristics to examine, explain, and compare. Conversely, studying the adoption of cyber deterrence may advance the study of more traditional strategies of deterrence. Most notably, studying cyber deterrence emphasizes that adoption of deterrence strategies cannot be taken as given but requires explanation. It also reveals our assumptions in studying deterrence. For example, traditional studies of deterrence take as given that the challenge is an act of violence or that the timing of the attack and the tim",

Studying cyber deterrence shows that these notions have implications for the practice of deterrence and for the study of it.\n\nRegarding cyber studies, exploring the strategy's adoption may account for changes in actors' behavior. In other words, studying cyber deterrence adoption demonstrates how technological and normative changes affect cyber strategies. In a similar way, we can study how culture, on the one hand, and rational calculations, on the other hand, affect behavior in the cyber domain. Studying cyber deterrence adoption makes cyber behavior more observable. Therefore, we can draw implications from it that go beyond those related solely to deterrence.\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nI would like to thank Patricia Greve, Gallia Lindenstrauss, and the three anonymous reviewers for their extremely helpful comments and suggestions on different drafts of this manuscript.

Studying cyber deterrence presents even greater challenges, as traditional deterrence challenges are exacerbated and interactions in the cyber domain create further difficulties. When studying cyber deterrence, scholars face uncertainty not only in identifying situations of deterrence success, but also—due to the secrecy surrounding cyber practices—in identifying situations of deterrence failure. Despite the many studies on cyber deterrence, methodological solutions to address these challenges still need to be developed. To this end, I suggest focusing on the adoption and employment of the strategy rather than on its success. I argue that since communicating threats is a core element of deterrence, it is easier to observe how the strategy is adopted and employed than whether it succeeds or fails. This focus provides a promising direction to study cyber deterrence and address these challenges.\nEl estudio de disuasión presenta una serie de desafíos, principalmente relacionados con la identificación de casos de éxito de disuasión y la definición de su funcionamiento. El estudio de la ciberdisuasión presenta desafíos aún mayores, ya que los desafíos tradicionales de la disuasión se ven exacerbados y las interacciones en el ámbito cibernético generan más dificultades. Al estudiar la ciberdisuasión, los académicos se enfrentan a la incertidumbre no solo a la hora de identificar situaciones de éxito de disuasión, sino también a la hora de identificar situaciones de fracaso de disuasión debido a la confidencialidad que gira en torno a las prácticas cibernéticas. A pesar de los numerosos estudios sobre la ciberdisuasión, todavía es necesario desarrollar soluciones metodológicas para abordar estos desafíos. Para lograrlo, sugiero enfocarse en la adopción e implementación de la estrategia más que en su éxito. Sostengo que, dado que comunicar amenazas es un elemento clave de la disuasión, es más fácil observar cómo se adopta e implementa la estrategia que identificar si tiene éxito o fracasa. Este enfoque marca un rumbo prometedor para estudiar la ciberdisuasión y abordar estos desafíos.\nL'étude de la dissuasion présente un certain nombre de défis qui sont principalement liés à l'identification de la réussite de la dissuasion et à la définition de la manière dont la dissuasion fonctionne.

Lorsqu'ils étudient la cyber-dissuasion, les chercheurs sont confrontés à de l'incertitude, non seulement dans l'identification des situations de réussite de la dissuasion, mais aussi—en raison du secret entourant les cyber-pratiques—dans l'identification de celles de son échec. Malgré les nombreuses études portant sur la cyber-dissuasion, des solutions méthodologiques doivent encore être développées pour aborder ces défis. À cette fin, je suggère une concentration sur l'adoption et l'emploi de la stratégie plutôt que sur son succès. Je soutiens qu'étant donné que la communication des menaces est un élément fondamental de la dissuasion, il est plus facile d'observer la façon dont la stratégie est adoptée et employée que d'observer si elle réussit ou échoue. Cette approche offre une orientation prometteuse pour étudier la cyber-dissuasion et aborder ces défis.\nKeywords: cyber, deterrence, methodology\nPalabras clave: cibernética, disuasión, metodología\nMots clés: cyber, dissuasion, méthodologie\n# Introduction\nResearch on cyber deterrence is rich and developing quickly. While scholars have pointed to the challenges of practicing cyber deterrence, their focus—like that of most deterrence scholars—has been on deterrence success. Most studies assess whether and how deterrence by punishment can be applied to the cyber domain (e.g., in Wilner 2020, 252–54), or whether and how it should be replaced with other strategies or types of deterrence, such as deterrence by denial (Iasiello 2013), or by cumulative deterrence (Tor 2017). These studies are part of the tendency Stevens (2016, 24) observes of cyber security studies to be “commonly oriented towards policy concerns.” Nonetheless, less attention is given to methodological challenges around studying cyber deterrence. This article aims to advance the methodology of studying (cyber) deterrence by offering a categorization of the methodological challenges concerning studying deterrence and by offering an alternative way to explore this strategy.\nInspired by the dog that did not bark problem—a bias in the study of deterrence toward cases of deterrence failure (Sauer 2016, 49)—I categorize three clusters of problems regarding the study of deterrence. Besides the dog that did not bark problem, I group additional challenges into two clusters of problems that I term the dog that did bark and the dog that should have barked problems. The former refers to challenges around interpreting cases of deterrence success and failure, and the latter to a bias that stems from the difficulty of identifying attacks and therefore seeing them as deterrence failures.\nBased on this categorization, I review and illustrate the challenges in studying cyber deterrence and the limited applicability of the current solutions offered to address them. These challenges include identifying deterrence success, selecting appropriate cases, and establishing causal connections between issuing the deterrent threat and deterrence success. While these problems generally characterize the study of deterrence, they are exacerbated in studying cyber deterrence, mainly because we cannot observe cyber deterrence successes and failures.\nI claim that one way to solve the challenges in studying cyber deterrence strategy is to shift focus from deterrence success to its adoption and employment. While this is\n¹Studying the adoption of cyber deterrence strategies overlaps with broader attempts to explore the motivation behind cyber strategies (e.g., Valeriano, Jensen, and Maness 2018; Gomez 2021).\nA Methodology for Cyber Deterrence Research\nnot the only solution—and indeed scholars still need to study deterrence success—I assert it provides a useful point of departure for thinking about and exploring this strategy.\nA number of scholars have begun to study the adoption of cyber deterrence strategies with illuminating insights (Kugler 2009, 311–13; Stevens 2012; Adamsky 2018; Healey 2019; Gold 2020, 8–21; Wilner 2020). While I rely on this scholarship, I also aim to advance it. The main goal for most of these works is to describe the evolution of the strategy rather than to explain the phenomenon of adopting the strategy. I suggest that using the adoption and employment of the strategy as the explained phenomenon (i.e., *explanandum*) is a promising method because of the observability of these aspects of the strategy. Communicating threats is a core element of a deterrence strategy, which makes the strategy’s adoption and employment much more explicit than its success or failure. This allows me to offer a categorization of how actors diverge in adopting and applying deterrence strategies, based on the goal, type, means, and explicitness of the strategy. This in turn provides a useful framework to study deterrence, and especially cyber deterrence strategies. Furthermore, as I demonstrate below, the study of the adoption and employment of cyber deterrence strategies encourages methodological pluralism, open to both positivist and interpretative methods.\nThe article proceeds as follows: In the first section, I discuss the main problems in the study of deterrence and the main solutions scholars offer to address them. In the second part, I specify the increased pressure of these challenges when studying cyber deterrence and argue that most solutions are not sufficient to remedy the problems. The third section develops a methodology for studying cyber deterrence, based on different characteristics that concern the adoption of the strategy. The fourth section shows and illustrates the promise of focusing on the adoption and employment of cyber deterrence to address the challenges. Such focus provides new research questions, explanations, and hypotheses, and diversifies the research of this strategy. I conclude by discussing the implications of this study on deterrence research in general and on cyber security research.\n## Methodological Challenges in Studying Deterrence\nScholars studying deterrence have paid a great deal of attention to methodological issues.³ While it is beyond this paper’s scope to discuss all the methodological challenges in the study of deterrence, I group the main challenges into three clusters. The first is based on what scholars refer to as the dog that did not bark problem. Building on this, I introduce two further problems: the dog that did bark and the dog that should have barked (see table 1).\n## The Dog That Did Not Bark\nThe dog that did not bark problem revolves around selection bias in studying cases of deterrence failure. Scholars are referring to Sherlock Holmes’ ability to solve a murder mystery based on the fact that a dog, present at the night of the murder, did not bark. Key to solving the case is the idea that there is meaning in the fact that something did not happen. The dog did not bark because the dog knew the perpetrator (see also Sauer 2016, 49). Based on this analogy, scholars have pointed to the flawed tendency to focus only on cases of deterrence failure, which provide\n³For reviews and comparisons of cyber strategies of different countries, see Thomas (2009), Lewis and Neuneck (2013), Luiijf, Besseling, Spoelstra, and De Graaf (2013), Liveri and Sarri (2014), and Baezner and Cordey (2019). See also King and Gallagher (2020, 144–45).\n³The debates over how to study deterrence, advanced not only research on deterrence and security, but also, and more broadly, studies in international relations (IR) and political science (e.g., see in King, Keohane, and Verba 1994, 24,134–35).\nAMIR LUPOVICI\n1675\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/isr/article/23/4/1672/6329772 by KIM Hohenheim user on 19 February 2024\nTable 1. Clusters of methodological challenges in the study of deterrence and cyber deterrence\n|  The problem | Description | Implications for the study of deterrence | Implications for the study of cyber deterrence  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  The dog that did not bark | The fact that the dog did not bark during a murder means something. In other words, it is important to analyze events that did not happen. | Scholars need to study not only cases of deterrence failure, but also cases of deterrence success (where allegedly nothing happens). However, the research suffers from a selection bias. Given the difficulties of studying cases of deterrence success, scholars tend to focus on studying cases of deterrence failure. | The selection bias is more challenging. Given the secrecy that surrounds interactions in the cyber domain, identifying cases of deterrence success is much more difficult, which further biases the study toward studying cases of deterrence failure.  |\n|  The dog that did bark | Interpreting events is very difficult. Dog’s barking does not necessarily mean that there was a murder, and vice versa (if the dog did not bark it does not mean that there was no murder). | Not only is the line between deterrence failure and success not clear-cut, but interpreting whether deterrence succeeded or failed based on the level of violence is problematic. Eruption of violence is not proof of deterrence failure, as lack of violence is not proof of deterrence success. | Interpreting events and concluding deterrence failure and success from observations is even more challenging given the secrecy surrounding cyber incidents and the ambiguity concerning what should be considered as violent attack (which constitute deterrence failure). Therefore, scholars face difficulties in classifying cases and in establishing (causal) explanations.  |\n|  The dog that should have barked | When the dog is not fully aware of the presence of a suspicious person, and therefore is not barking (e.g., in case of a murder, the dog is failing to notice or is noticing too late). | This challenge poses another sort of case selection bias, as obviously scholars are only able to study the cases they are aware of. | Scholars are not only biased toward studying cases of deterrence failure as indicated by the traditional challenge of studying deterrence. In cases of cyber deterrence, scholars are also not fully aware of cases of deterrence failure. This biases the research in different ways, including scholars’ tendency to focus on a limited number of known case studies of cyber deterrence failure for which relatively more information is available.  |\nA Methodology for Cyber Deterrence Research\nconsiderable observable traces to follow—the employment of violence by at least one of the parties (Achen and Snidal 1989, 161; Lebow and Stein 1990, 336, 347; King, Keohane, and Verba 1994, 24). Positivist scholars use this analogy to challenge scholars' ability to provide a full coloration given that they focus on one possible value of the examined variable of deterrence success—that is, deterrence failure. Some scholars have even suggested the problem is deeper, since focusing on deterrence failures leads to exploration of much more resolute actors—those “who select themselves into crises” and therefore are less likely to be deterred (Danilovic 2002, 117–19; Fearon 2002, 6, 14; see also Wilner 2015, 190, footnote 4, p. 241).\nWhile the problematic tendency to focus on cases of deterrence failure clearly exists, it should be noted that lack of violence is not a nonoccurrence. As Tannenwald, emphasizes, \"[T]here is no such thing as explaining a non-event . . . What is actually being explained is a contrast between an actual event and a possible alternative counterfactual event.\" What we are in fact asking is not why the dog did not bark, but why the dog was silent, as we have a reasonable expectation that in such situations the counterfactual (e.g., barking) is a likely scenario (Tannenwald 2007, 30). From this perspective, when deterrence succeeds (and there is no violence) something does happen: policymakers decide that the cost of violence is too high for them to pursue the act the defender aims to prevent. Put differently, it is not that nothing happened, but rather that we cannot easily see it.\n## The Dog That Did Bark\nI use the phrase the dog that did bark to refer to difficulties around interpreting observations. We cannot deduce an occurrence from an event that correlates with another event. Usually dogs bark when they notice a suspicious person (e.g., a potential murderer); however, of course, we cannot deduce, just because a dog barked that a murder has taken place. Similarly, in the absence of suspicious activity, dogs do not bark. But the fact a dog did not bark does not mean no crime occurred. This analogy allows us to group a number of challenges around determining deterrence failure and success and their implications.\nNotably, the eruption of violence does not necessarily indicate deterrence failure. First, deterrence success is not a binary variable. For example, some scholars argue that, unlike nuclear deterrence, in cases of low(er) levels of violence, decreasing the amount of violence can be considered deterrence success even if it does not totally prevent the violence (Rid 2012; Wenger and Wilner 2012, 318). Second, paradoxically, in some cases, deterrence success increases the level of violence, as an opponent can execute a challenge to provoke retaliation in order to attain political gain.\nNonetheless, not only can we not deduce deterrence failure from violence, but, and more importantly, we cannot deduce deterrence success from observing lack of violence. For example, there may be no challenger. As Morgan (2003, 121) argues, if a state \"has no intention of attacking the case cannot tell us whether deterrence works and how.\" In addition, even if the challenger has motivation to attack the defender, it may refrain for reasons other than the deterrent posture of the defender.\n4 Basically, this challenge could also be termed the dog that did not bark problem. However, in order to avoid confusion, I group this challenge—concerning interpretation of events—as the dog that did bark problem, while I group the problem of bias in case selection as the dog that did not bark.\n5 For example, Mendelsohn (2003, 97–100) interprets the rockets Iraq launched over Israel during the Gulf War in 1992 as an attempt to erode the American-led coalition by provoking Israel to retaliate, assuming that given its credible deterrent posture it would not be able to contain such an attack.\n6 The struggle between Israel and Hizbullah clearly demonstrates this point. Many Israeli officials (e.g., Halutz 2009, 66; Olmert 2014, 15) and scholars (e.g., Aran 2012, 854; Rid 2012, 141) assert that Israel established a deterrent posture vis-à-vis Hizbullah, evident in Hizbullah’s restraint after the 2006 War. However, alternative explanations exist for Hizbullah’s relative restraint in different periods of time, including Hizbullah’s limited capability after the war, its\nAMIR LUPOVICI\n1677\nFurthermore, as Lebow and Stein (1990, 345) clearly state, “[W]hen reliable evidence of a challenger’s calculations is lacking, no decision can be made about the coding of the outcome of a deterrence encounter.” Scholars, thus, disagree over whether cases should be classified as deterrence success or failure (Achen and Snidal 1989, 162; Morgan 2003, 121–22): for example, whether to use the number of causalities (see Lebow and Stein 1990, 344) or the level of violence as the line between deterrence failure and success. The challenge of classifying cases is exacerbated by the fact that actors see themselves as the defender and their opponent as the challenger (Lebow and Stein 1989, 221, 223; Morgan 2003, 121–22).\n## The Dog That Should Have Barked\nWhile the two challenges presented above—the dog that did not bark and the dog that did bark—group and refer to known problems and biases in the study of deterrence, the dog that should have barked emphasizes a less-studied challenge. This problem stems from the expectation that the dog needs to bark if something suspicious is happening. As noted above, the counterfactual is that if the dog did not bark, it means something. However, inspired by this analogy we can also create a third cluster: a situation where the dog did not bark, but should have. While this can be seen as a subcategory of the dog that did not bark problem, the counterfactual here is different. Unlike the original, in which the dog had no reason to bark, in this situation, if the dog were aware of the occurrence, then it would definitely be barking. Nonetheless, the dog that should have barked problem also differs from the dog that did bark problem. The dog that did bark points to a situation in which the occurrence is known but its meaning is not. In the dog that should have barked, not only is the interpretation unclear, but what happened remains a mystery.\nFor the purpose of the study of deterrence, this analogy emphasizes situations in which practitioners are unaware of what happened, or at least of situations that have no public record.7 This means that scholars are limited in using these cases. Not only are they unaware of cases of deterrence success (as evident in the dog that did not bark problem), but they may also be unaware of cases of deterrence failure.\n## Current Solutions in Scholarship\nThe dog that did not bark and what I term the dog that did bark point to three main challenges in the study of deterrence: (1) bias in case selection; (2) difficulty of determining deterrence success and deterrence failure, and thus of classifying case studies; and (3) problems in establishing causality, that is, in showing that there is not only a correlation between the issuing of the threats and the avoidance of violence, but that the deterrent threat causes it (George and Smoke 1974, 90–93; Luke 1989, 214; Lebow and Stein 1990, 345; Freedman 2004, 13). Scholars offer a number of solutions to these challenges.\nFirst, scholars urge careful selection of case studies. Among other things, they recommend exploring critical case studies of deterrence failure (Lebow and Stein 1989, 221–22). In addition, Huth and Russett suggest focusing on immediate deterrence rather than on cases of general deterrence. Immediate deterrence is characterized by explicit threats or the movement of alerting military forces, and thus it provides the observer with “reasonable assessment of whether deterrence succeeded or failed” (Huth and Russett 1988, 30). Also, they suggest examining cases of both deterrence failure and deterrence success (Huth and Russett 1990,\ninvolvement in Syria since 2012 and especially since 2013, and the pressure from Iran not to waste resources (Lupovici 2016b, 183).\n7These situations usually result from what Baliga, Bueno De Mesquita, and Wolitzky (2020, 1055) refer to as detection failure, where defenders are unaware that an attack occurred.\nA Methodology for Cyber Deterrence Research\n468–73). However, as Jervis asserts, this solution is limited, as the important question is why deterrence fails and not the frequency of deterrence failures (Jervis 1989, 194).\nSecond, scholars suggest examining the long-term dynamics of enduring rivals to address a number of challenges in the study of deterrence (Stein 1996; Lieberman 2013; Danilovic and Clare 2017, 14–15). This enables the exploration not only of immediate deterrence, but also of general deterrence. Morgan (2003, 82) suggests that focusing only on crises is problematic since it prevents studying the inter-crises periods, which are crucial because actors often attempt to employ general deterrence strategy. Focusing on enduring rivals also addresses the bias in studying mainly cases of deterrence failure. It helps to establish the causal connections by addressing questions around whether the challenger seriously considered war or, if the challenger backed down, whether it was affected by the defender’s deterrent strategy. In addition, it helps to establish a more focused comparison because the same actors are examined over time. Finally, studying enduring rivals also addresses the challenge of identifying the defender and the challenger, by revealing shifts in actors’ balance of interests (Lieberman 2013, 29–32; see also Stein 1996).\nThird, scholars suggest dealing with the challenge of identifying deterrence success by developing hypotheses about the defender, the challenger, and the conflict (Stern, Axelrod, Jervis, and Rander 1989, 6, 19–21, 33). While this solution complements some other solutions, it leads in practice to debates around results without necessarily providing convincing explanations. A prime example of these limitations is the study of whether the actual use of force contributes to enhancing a deterrent posture and demonstrating resolve (Schelling 1966, 116–25; Mercer 1996; Press 2005; Tang 2005; Rid 2012, 128; Lupton 2018, 61–66). This issue is highly debated, and scholars suggest the empirical findings on it are inconclusive and that further research is needed (Huth 1997; Sartori 2005, 9; Weisiger and Yarhi-Milo 2015, 479).\nFourth, scholars have advised relying on primary sources and detailed historical accounts to better determine the defender and challenger and to better establish deterrence success (or failure). This will also decrease selection bias in the study of deterrence (Lebow and Stein 1990, 346–51). Following these ideas, Wilner (2011, 32–33), for example, suggests that primary sources are crucial to establishing the putative challenger’s intentions and how they change. While use of primary sources is promising, a common problem is the difficulty of accessing the kind of evidence needed. Leaders’ statements may not be sincere, especially around the effect of the deterrent threat on behavior. As Morgan asserts, the challenger “won’t announce that it backed down because it was scared: instead, it never planned to attack” (Morgan 2003, 122; see also Huth and Russett 1990, 491). Even in private discussions, policymakers tend not to admit the effect of the opponent’s deterrence strategy (Lebow and Stein 1989, 222). The sources that help address this challenge come from closed meetings, classified policy analyses, and military orders and assessments, all of which are hard to trace (Huth and Russett 1990, 491). However, they do provide much stronger evidence of whether and how deterrent threat shapes a putative challenger’s behavior.\n## Challenges in Studying Cyber Deterrence\nThe challenges around studying conventional and nuclear deterrence are much more pressing in the context of cyber deterrence. Not only do interactions in the\n8 An example of using these materials is evident in Golov (2013), who explores the effectiveness of American and Israeli deterrence vis-à-vis Iraq during the Gulf War (1991–1992) based on captured documents.\n9 Huth and Russett (1990, 481–82, 491) admit that primary sources provide key evidence for establishing deterrence success. However, they warn that conducting studies based just on such evidence may bias the research, as they are accessible only in a very limited number of cases.\nAMIR LUPOVICI\n1679\ncyber domain aggravate these challenges, but some of the solutions suggested to address them are hard to employ.\n## Cyber Deterrence Research\nMost scholars acknowledge that cyber deterrence involves the use of threats to prevent cyberattacks or attacks on defender’s information systems (Stevens 2012, 149–52; Lupovici 2016a, 324–25).¹⁰ Many agree that successfully employing cyber deterrence strategy is difficult (in Morgan 2010; Stevens 2012, 149–53). Among other things, they argue that defending actors cannot easily pose a credible threat because of the difficulty of identifying the challenger, the large number of potential challengers, the asymmetry between the challengers and the defenders, the low entry costs, the limited public support to retaliate against cyberattacks, and the defenders’ difficulty exposing their capabilities (Harknett 1996; Molander, Riddle, and Wilson 1996, 87; Cordesman and Cordesman 2001, 7; Arquilla 2003, 210–13; Libicki 2007, 271–72; Libicki 2009, 1–3, 26, 44–45; Morgan 2010, 55–76; Geers 2011, 111–22; Fischerkeller and Harknett 2017, 386–87; Kreps and Schneider 2019; Fischerkeller, Harknett, and Vičić 2020, 25–30).\nIndeed, some scholars suggest various methods to enhance the effectiveness of deterrence strategy in dissuading cyberattacks. Recently, scholars have become more optimistic about achieving this goal. For example, scholars offer innovative ways to think about the implications of the attribution problem and how deterrence can work under imperfect attribution (Glaser 2011, 3; Baliga, Bueno De Mesquita, and Wolitzky 2020). Scholars also suggest that the attribution problem can be addressed in various, mainly technical and technological, ways (e.g., Rid and Buchanan 2014; Egloff and Dunn Cavelty 2021) and therefore should not necessarily prevent the execution of retaliation. Furthermore, the attribution problem is not a challenge for deterrence theory per se, but is shaped through social norms that might be changed over time (Lupovici 2016a).\nScholars suggest that, in addition to deterrence by punishment, actors also rely on tailored deterrence; serial and cumulative deterrence; deterrence by denial; deterrence by naming and shaming; deterrence through the development of international norms; and deterrence by detection. Scholars also note that actors could deter by punishment through the threat of using kinetic means, and not just through cyber means (Wheatley and Hayes 1996, 13, 19–20; Cordesman and Cordesman 2001, 7; Kugler 2009; Morgan 2010, 59, 68; Glaser 2011, 4; Stevens 2012; Tor 2017; Nye 2017; Lindsay and Gartzke 2018, 192; Schneider 2019a, 109; Wilner 2020, 253).¹¹ They have also suggested that cyber deterrence is more likely to be effective against a potential cyberattack that is equivalent to armed conflict. This is because in such situations, the impact of the unique characteristics of cyberspace on deterrence will be less pronounced (Fischerkeller, Harknett, and Vičić 2020, 29).\nWhile debates continue, these scholars emphasize the theoretical questions—whether and when cyber deterrence may work—and offer policy implications. Nonetheless, less attention is given to methodological questions and challenges around studying these issues, and to how evidence should be collected and analyzed.\n¹⁰ For a review of this scholarship, see Nye (2017); Mandel (2017, 43–64); Wilner (2020, 251–56).\n¹¹ Cooper (2012, 111–18) suggests the concept of *network deterrence*. He argues that the combination of means such as punishment, futility, and dependency could strengthen deterrence effectiveness when defenders and putative challengers share a network.\nA Methodology for Cyber Deterrence Research\n## The Impact of Problems in Studying Deterrence on the Research on Cyber Deterrence\n### The Dog That Did Not Bark\nLike other studies of deterrence, cyber deterrence scholarship is biased toward focusing on cases of deterrence failure. In fact, the limited access to data and the limited evidence available to scholars result in greater research bias. This is not necessarily a problem for specific studies that focus on a small number of prominent case studies. However, it is a challenge to the scholarship as a whole. As Valeriano and Maness observe, “[c]omparative case studies are rare, given the tendency to focus on events that might be outliers,” such as Estonia (2007), Stuxnet (2010), and Sony Hack (2014), leaving aside typical cyber interactions (Valeriano and Maness 2018, 260). These overlooked interactions may include cases of deterrence success.\nThe research, then, not only tends to examine cases of deterrence failure, but also focuses on a limited number of cases. Methodologically, it is not clear to what extent these cases represent the general “population” of cases of cyber deterrence. For example, the reason that led to the availability of the case for deterrence scholars may also have affected the deterrence outcome. Given the secrecy that surrounds many cyberattack incidents, known cases of deterrence failures may indicate situations in which resolute actors chose to challenge.\n### The Dog That Did Bark\nThis problem concerns how scholars interpret observations: the challenge of establishing whether a certain case is a deterrence failure or success and thus of establishing the causal mechanism of deterrence failure/success. The secrecy around cyber incidents and the limited information available to scholars exacerbate the challenges in deterrence research (see also Burton 2018, 6; Healey and Jenkins 2019, 125). These challenges include actors’ tendency to see themselves as the defender (and not the challenger) and the difficulty of developing a more nuanced classification of deterrence success/failure: one that is not dichotomic but acknowledges that deterrence failure and deterrence success are on a continuum. In a similar way, a significant challenge is to determine what constitutes deterrence failure. While in the kinetic domains, scholars, practitioners, and law experts have over many years developed an understanding of this, it is still debated in the cyber domain (e.g., Schmitt 2017). This further complicates the academic community’s ability to interpret deterrence failure and success, and to classify cases.\nThe challenge of identifying relevant cases not only creates selection bias, but also complicates the ability to determine the impact of the deterrent threat on the putative challenger’s behavior. This difficulty is shaped by the combination of the limitation of available information on cyberattacks and the characteristics of cyberattacks, which make the temporality of the attack a key issue. In kinetic domains, the timing of the attack and of the damage is similar; and in most cases, damage follows shortly after the attack’s execution. For example, it takes a few minutes for an intercontinental missile to hit its target, and damage will follow and start impacting the defender usually less than an hour after the initiation of the attack. Because of the various modes and stages of executing cyberattacks, on the other hand, scholars have to distinguish between the timing of the attack and the timing of the damage (e.g., Brantly and Smeets forthcoming, 4–5). Challengers can better control the timing of the attack. They can predetermine the attack or use the original attack as a platform for future attacks. This increased difficulty in identifying the deterrent threat’s timing and its influence on the putative challenger’s behavior makes study of it much more onerous. Furthermore, it raises a crucial question about the meaning of deterrence success: that is, whether executing an attack can be considered deterrence failure if the damage has yet to occur. All of this inhibits our ability to interpret deterrence success or to classify cases of deterrence failure and success.\nAMIR LUPOVICI\n1681\n# The Dog That Should Have Barked\nUnlike the previous two clusters of challenges, this problem mainly affects the study of cyber deterrence. While the dog that did not bark emphasizes the problems stemming from being unable to observe cases of deterrence success, this problem emphasizes problems stemming from being unable to clearly observe cases of deterrence failure.\nIn other domains, the execution of an attack leaves traces and evidence that scholars can use. These traces help scholars to determine the case as deterrence failure, as well as to examine aspects related to the execution of the challenge: for example, the damage, how it was done, and by whom. In contrast, cyberattacks usually leave fewer traces. In fact, even a significant cyberattack may not be easily traced. For example, a cyberattack may target the electricity grid but be masked as an accident or a failure of the system (see also Schneider 2019a, 114). Furthermore, in some cases, the effectiveness of cyberattacks requires that they will remain untraced. In the well-known case of Stuxnet, the worm aimed not only to damage Iranian centrifuges, but also to confuse the Iranian scientists regarding the sources of the problem (Farwell and Rohozinski 2012, 115).\nWhile the research on cyber deterrence focuses on the problem of attribution—a situation in which the source of an attack is unknown—a key difficulty concerns a more fundamental challenge: the ability to detect that there was an attack in the first place. Brantly, for example, notes that in the cyber domain it is more important “to identify that an attack is occurring . . . than to in the moment identify who is actually conducting the attack” (Brantly 2016, 87). Moreover, regardless of whether or not the victim is aware of the attack, it is a challenge for scholars, who often have limited access to such information. For this reason, some scholars state their main focus is to study compelling success rather than deterrence success. Valeriano, Jensen, and Maness (2018, 24) suggest that “[o]ur choice to focus on compelling is driven by the need to examine the efficacy of operations that seek to achieve demonstrable effects. Compreciency is about changing behavior, while deterrence is about preventing behaviors, the latter being difficult to observe empirically.”\n# The Limitations of Current Solutions\nThe solutions put forward to address challenges in studying deterrence have advanced deterrence research, but they have encountered some difficulties. Applying them to cyber deterrence studies, that focus on exploring deterrence success/failure, creates additional problems, given the unique characteristics of cyber deterrence and how knowledge around cyber incidents and cyber deterrence is produced. While common solutions may become more effective in the future, as technology changes and reliable information on cyber incidents increases, they are currently quite limited.\nOne direction for a solution is to acquire data and conduct quantitative studies based on it. While a few scholars have started to use these methods to examine cyber deterrence success or closely related behavior with interesting findings (e.g., Brantly 2016; Pytlak and Mitchell 2016),[12] they have also pointed to challenges in using data to this end (e.g., Valeriano, Jensen, and Maness 2018, 24). Others also indicate the need to develop new ways to use data given the challenges of studying this strategy (Pytlak and Mitchell 2016, 79).\nBecause of the challenges of studying cyber deterrence, it is difficult to employ the solutions discussed above based on careful selection of specific case studies—that is, focusing on critical case studies and immediate deterrence and exploring\n[12] For example, Brantly’s (2016, 143–49) findings support the assertions that actors’ ability to maintain anonymity enhances the chances for deterrence failure. Nonetheless, Pytlak and Mitchell are unable to establish significant correlation and in the end reach inconclusive interpretations of the evidence (Pytlak and Mitchell 2016, 73–79).\nA Methodology for Cyber Deterrence Research\ncases of deterrence failure as well as of deterrence success. These solutions cannot fully resolve the challenges of determining cyber incidents and identifying and classifying situations of cyber deterrence failure and success. Jervis (1989, 194) has warned that explaining deterrence failure and success is more important than explaining their frequency; this caution is even more important in studying cyber deterrence given that the cases scholars are able to examine are more biased. The challenges of case selection stem not only from the dog that did not bark problem, but also from the dog that did bark and the dog that should have barked problems—biasing cases both of deterrence success and of deterrence failure.\nLikewise, focusing on cases of immediate deterrence also becomes a challenge when studying cyber deterrence, mainly because of the lack of available information and the characteristics of cyberattacks themselves. Scholars must distinguish the time of the attack, the time of its damage, the time the defender acknowledges the attack (and the damage), and the time the attack becomes public knowledge.¹³ The defender itself may be unaware that it needs to employ an immediate deterrence threat. For example, in contrast to other domains, preparations for attacks in the cyber domain leave less traces compared to preparations of kinetic attacks and thus complicate the ability of deterrer actors to pose an immediate deterrent threat. This means that examining cases of immediate deterrence is of limited help in studying cyber deterrence: actors have fewer opportunities to perform this strategy, the existence of known cases of immediate cyber deterrence may be biased,¹⁴ and, most importantly, scholars may not have access to full information on these cases.\nSolutions put forward to better establish the causal connection between the deterrent threat and the challenger behavior face similar challenges. Along with the problems discussed (case selection and identification of deterrence failure and success, which also limit establishing the \"explanation\") is the limited available information on the case studies. This makes additional potential solutions impractical, such as the relying on primary sources. Likewise, while studying enduring rivals could address some of the challenges around establishing causal connections (as well as eliminating biases in case selection), it is questionable whether such enduring rivals and conflicts in the cyber domain exist, or whether scholars can acquire enough relevant information about them to allow such research. Cyber deterrence scholars, therefore, experience significant challenges because of difficulties identifying cases of deterrence success or failure. While these problems accompany the study of deterrence in general—both quantitative and qualitative works—they are worse in the study of cyber deterrence and intensify other challenges. Under these conditions, researchers need to go back to the same case studies, in this way possibly missing other important factors affecting the practices of deterrence.\n## Toward a Methodology for Studying Cyber Deterrence\nThe challenges discussed above, and the limited applicability of current solutions to address them, increase the attractiveness of an alternative methodological solution to explore cyber deterrence. While, it is impossible to fully resolve all the challenges in the study of cyber deterrence, this article provides some directions toward this goal. I advance a solution based on studying the adoption of cyber deterrence strategy. By the adoption of cyber deterrence strategy, I refer to one of two things: (1) a strategic change, in which an actor moves toward a decision to rely on at least one type of cyber deterrence strategy (e.g., punishment, denial, detection),\n¹³On policy decisions to reveal or conceal experiencing cyberattacks, see Baram and Sommer (2019).\n¹⁴Given how difficult it is for the defender to identify the need to issue an immediate cyber deterrence threat, the fact that a defender successfully identifies this need may itself affect its ability to issue a successful deterrent threat. Whereas in other domains the putative challenger may also attempt to disguise its attempt to attack, defender actors have more means to identify it prior to the attack.\nAMIR LUPOVICI\n1683\nor (2) the actual employment of such a strategy. In both cases, the adoption of a cyber deterrence strategy can also refer to a shift in how the strategy of deterrence is practiced.\nStudying the adoption of deterrence strategies has not been given enough scholarly attention. Indeed, my exploration of this phenomenon overlaps with various studies on different types of deterrence strategies (e.g., nuclear, conventional).¹⁵ Some scholars, as noted above, have even started to specifically study cyber deterrence adoption (Kugler 2009, 311–13; Stevens 2012; Adamsky 2018; Healey 2019; Gold 2020, 8–21; Wilner 2020). Nonetheless, few of these studies theorize this adoption, being more interested in the historical process through which deterrence was embraced.¹⁶ Furthermore, these scholars do not see research on adoption of the strategy as a methodological solution to challenges in studying deterrence.\nIn contrast, I suggest focusing on the adoption of deterrence strategy as a way to address the methodological challenges of studying (cyber) deterrence. Such a focus allows scholars to explore the various ways actors adopt this strategy and to apply different methods to ascertain this phenomenon and explain it. But before detailing the advantages of studying the adoption and employment of deterrence strategies, it is useful to categorize them. For example, the various ways actors adopt cyber deterrence strategies can be categorized based on the threat they aim to dissuade and their types, means, and degrees of explicitness.\n## The Undesired Activity to Be Deterred\nActors can use cyber deterrence to deter threats not only in the cyber domain but also in other domains. In the former, the strategy of cyber deterrence can be used to deter different types of cyber threats that vary in intensity, complexity, and feasibility (e.g., Brantly 2016, 116–17; Burton 2018, 28–29). Brantly, for example, distinguishes three main categories of activities actors attempt to deter: cyberattacks, cyber espionage, and cyber theft (Brantly 2020, 8–9).¹⁷ Defending actors may also develop a cross-domain deterrence strategy to dissuade threats conducted through cyber space that target supply chains or critical infrastructures or that may affect military activities and effectiveness (Schneider 2019a, 103, 108–9).\nOther categories of employing cyber deterrence strategy concern the use of cyber means to dissuade attacks in kinetic domains (Lupovici 2016a, 325). For example, cyber means may bolster conventional deterrence (Schneider 2019a, 115–19, but see Libicki 2016, 281). In a similar way, cyber means may affect nuclear deterrence. Some scholars estimate that advances in artificial intelligence may undermine nuclear deterrence (Lieber and Press 2017, 10; Horowitz 2019, 782; Johnson 2020, 429–38). However, others who study developments in Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA), including the advancement of autonomous machines and computerized devices, point to how in some situations these systems may enhance deterrence vis-à-vis different kinds of kinetic attacks (Fortmann and Von Hlatky 2009, 309–12).\nA related question about the type of threat is the specific phase of the cyberattack defenders wish to deter. Brantly and Smeets (forthcoming, 4–5) distinguish among different stages of cyberattack, such as the penetration of the defender’s system to\n¹⁵ Some scholars indirectly refer to the adoption of the strategy while studying “deterrence success” as part of operationalizing deterrence threat. For example, in defining the issuing of an immediate extended deterrent threat, Huth and Russett argue that scholars need to focus on “observable behavioral indicators in the form of statements and military actions that signal the threat to use force if the protégé is attacked.” According to them, even if this is a bluff, it is part of practicing deterrence (Huth and Russett 1990, 488). However, their goal of operationalizing the issuing of the deterrent threat is to establish covariance as part of explaining deterrence success.\n¹⁶ This type of approach is clearly evident in Freedman and Michaels’ (2019) seminal book on the evolution of nuclear strategies in different periods of time and in different countries.\n¹⁷ In addition, scholars refer to more specific challenges, such as deterring the use of information warfare through cyber platforms (Whyte 2020b, 237–39).\nA Methodology for Cyber Deterrence Research\ninstall the means of attack and the execution of the attack to actually generate the damage.\n## Types of Deterrent Strategies\nActors differ in what specific type of deterrent strategies, or combination of them, they adopt. Currently, in addition to deterrence by punishment, scholars tend to emphasize the following types of cyber deterrence strategies: tailored deterrence (Kugler 2009), punctuated/cumulative deterrence (Kello 2017; Tor 2017, 205–11), deterrence by denial (Iasiello 2013; Libicki 2016, 268–70; Nye 2017, 56–7), deterrence by detection or by accusation (Lindsay and Gartzke 2018, 192; Finnemore and Hollis 2020, 980–81), and deterrence by naming and shaming and through development of international norms (Nye 2017, 60–62; Stevens 2012; see also Libicki 2009, 68).\n## The Deterrent Means\nNot only can actors adopt different types of cyber deterrence strategies, but they can also employ each strategy with different means. For example, deterrence by punishment may be based not only on the defender’s cyber means, but also on its economic, diplomatic, and kinetic means (e.g., Kugler 2009, 328; Jasper 2017, 95–96; Schneider 2019a). In a similar way, actors can employ deterrence by denial not only by communicating their defensive means, but also by communicating their means to avoid the damage, such as by establishing backup systems to ensure the resilience of the information infrastructures (see also Nye 2017, 57).\n## Degree of Explicitness\nWhether and how actors publicly declare they will respond to a challenge is fundamental to understanding these practices in any domain of conflict (Brantly 2016, 113). Given the fact that communicating threats is a core element of deterrence strategy, the degree of explicitness is a key characteristic of how cyber deterrence strategy is adopted and employed. Deterrent threats are communicated through a wide spectrum of expressions—ranging from full explicitness to lack of any reference to the deterrent threat—that contain three main elements:\nOne element is how the threat is articulated and directed at an opponent: for example, whether the threat is generally stated in a strategic document (e.g., Department of Defense 2011) or the defender targets specific opponents (e.g., Department of Defense 2018, 1).\nA second element is how explicitly the undesired activity the defender wants to prevent is communicated. Scholars have debated over this issue when studying deterrence in other domains, contemplating whether a red line should be clearly stated or not (e.g., Lockhart 1978, 548–51; Schelling 1981, 38–41).\nA third element is the extent to which the deterrent threat itself is communicated. Actors differ in how explicitly they present the consequences that will stem from the challenger’s undesired activity: whether, for example, the defender specifies the retaliatory punishment or only presents it generally. A number of US documents have stated that the United States preserves the right to retaliate against a cyberattack with all the means they hold (Department of Defense 2011, 2; Department of Defense 2013, 32, 41–42; see also in Healey 2019; and in Wilner 2020). While some argue that actors can achieve a deterrent effect by specifying what a retaliatory strike will include (to a specific challenger) (e.g., Kugler 2009, 331–32), others suggest that states often issue a more general threat, using ambiguity as a mechanism of deterrence (e.g., Brantly 2016, 114). Conversely, actors may refrain from explicitly\nAMIR LUPOVICI\n1685\nadopting a cyber deterrence strategy and remain silent in this regard. They may choose to contain attacks in order to avoid further escalation and may consider a deterrent strategy as inadequate to address the challenges. Actors may also retaliate without issuing a deterrent threat prior to their response.\nOther possibilities exist between full explicitness and non-explicitness in communicating deterrent threats. Kugler (2009, 311–3), for example, reviews key US documents since 2003 and concludes that while they acknowledge the need to develop cyber deterrence strategy, they do not elaborate on how it can be attained.¹⁸ Likewise, actors, such as in the Israeli case, may discuss the need to adopt a strategy of cyber deterrence or wish to develop such a strategy but refrain from directly and explicitly issuing deterrent threats. In the last decade, senior Israeli policymakers have made the point that Israel should acquire a cyber deterrence strategy. For example, when serving as minister of defense, Ehud Barak suggested that in the uncertainty that cyber capabilities create, “leadership is required to show the way as to how to do the right thing for Israel and to establish a deterrent balance” (Barak 2012). Prime Minister Netanyahu also explained the need to develop a cyber deterrence strategy despite the fact that “[t]he ability to deter is more difficult because the source of such an attack is more anonymous. This is a problem we will certainly have to address” (Netanyahu 2011).\nInterestingly, in May 2020, it seems that Israel has moved to adopt an even more explicit cyber deterrence strategy when its retaliation against targets in Iran in response to a cyberattack on water infrastructures in Israel was reported (Warrick and Nakashima 2020). The publication of the Israeli retaliation, as well as other statements made by Israeli officials such as by Minister of Defense, Naftali Bennett, were interpreted as an attempt of Israel to send deterrent messages to the Iranians and to draw a red line (Siman Tov and Even 2020).\nSending deterrent messages through acts of retaliation is closely related to the concepts of punctuated deterrence and cumulative deterrence, where the actual use of force aims to punish and deliver a threatening message over a long period of time (Kello 2017, 205–11; Tor 2017). Even before the incidents of May 2020, some experts interpreted Israel’s offensive cyber capabilities in this context, claiming they aim in part to deter potential challengers and “show potential attackers what Israel is able to do if it chooses to respond to an attack” (Cohen, Freilich and Siboni 2016, 313).\nSome degree of explicitness—and thus communication and signaling—is a crucial aspect of these practices. According to Kello (2017, 209), “Diplomatic and signaling procedures will be required to demonstrate to adversaries that for the purpose of punishment, individual hostile actions are regarded as a comprehensive package of offensive activity rather than being disparate actions that merit isolated responses.” Likewise, as Tor (2017, 107) asserts, just the use of force is insufficient in creating a cumulative cyber deterrent strategy, as there is also a need to “to outline the ‘rules of the game’ in a clear way.”¹⁹\n## Advantages in Focusing on Adoption of Cyber Deterrence Strategy\nFocusing on the adoption and employment of cyber deterrence has a number of theoretical and methodological advantages: it diversifies research by highlighting an overlooked phenomenon, it invites plural approaches and methods that help to better explain and understand actors’ behavior, and it thus emphasizes\n¹⁸ In this respect, comparing US documents reveals a growing specification of cyber deterrence strategies over the years (e.g., in Kugler 2009, 311–13).\n¹⁹ Examples of less explicit messages that serve deterrent goals can be found in leaking of information around cyberattacks—such as Stuxnet, the corruption of Syria’s air defense system, the Chinese penetration of American health insurer files, and the Russian hack into the US Democratic Party files (Perkovich and Levite 2017, 273; see also Mazanec and Thayer 2014, 69).\nA Methodology for Cyber Deterrence Research\nthe importance of various strategic, normative, and cultural aspects related to this phenomenon. While to some extent these advantages could also be achieved by diverting the study around cyber deterrence failure/success to these directions, the main advantage lies in the observability that studying the adoption of the strategy allows. Not only does this advantage stand by its own in improving our understanding of the practices of cyber deterrence, but it also enhances the other advantages: diversification of the research and the use of plural methods.\n## Observability\nThe main advantage of studying the adoption and employment of deterrence strategy is the ability to trace empirical evidence of it. The idea behind a strategy of deterrence, as discussed above, is to issue and communicate threats. The communication can be more or less explicit—and can even be a bluff; however, it is a crucial part of practicing this strategy.\nEven if the deterrent threat is a bluff,²⁰ the methodological solution based on studying the adoption and employment of (cyber) deterrent strategy cannot be dismissed based on an assertion that issuing deterrent threats is cheap talk. Given the cult of reputation and practitioners' worry about resolve (e.g., Tang 2005; Kertzer 2016),²¹ a defender may find it costly to not execute the deterrent threat or retaliate in case the undesired attack has been made by the putative challenger. They may fear that other actors will challenge them in the future because of the alleged demonstration of weakness. Actors thus are likely to take the adoption of cyber deterrence strategy and the issuing of deterrent threat seriously; issuing deterrent threats, therefore, provides indications of an actor's strategy.\nFocusing on observable indications allows scholars to address challenges in the study of cyber deterrence that stem from limited access to details around practicing cyber deterrence that in many cases remain unknown, such as the attack, the damage, and when the defender identified it was attacked. First, the problem of the dog that did not bark and the problem of the dog that should have barked become less pressing. Focusing on strategy adoption and the issuing of deterrent threat involves observing changes in the behavior of the defender actor. From this perspective, and as further discussed below, scholars can study nuances in strategy adoption, conduct comparisons among actors and over time, and explain this phenomenon regardless of the putative challenger's behavior or of the deterrence strategy outcomes. In other words, the research will not be biased toward studying specific cases of deterrence failure.\nStudying cyber deterrence strategy adoption also addresses challenges around the dog that did bark problem. By focusing mainly on the behavior of the defender actor, scholars have much less difficulty in interpretation, as the outcome to be examined and explained is less ambiguous. Indeed, scholars may debate over whether an actor actually adopted a cyber deterrence strategy, how it differs from its previous strategies, and about its specific elements. However, because adopting and employing a strategy of deterrence requires some degree of explicitness—unlike deterrence successes and even cyber deterrence failures—scholars also have much more access to empirical evidence to discuss and dispute.\n²⁰ Likewise, as Libicki (2016, 227) and Tor (2017, 107) note actors may deliver their deterrent messages not only in public channels but also in secret ones. While for scholars the delivering of deterrent messages secretly poses difficulties of observing and studying the occurrences, actors have incentives to make some public manifestations of the deterrent threat they issue, even indirectly, in order to target larger audiences. In addition, the focus of the suggested methodology is on the strategy, and not necessarily on the communication of a specific threat to a certain opponent. For example, in theory, a cyber deterrence strategy may be adopted explicitly, but the explicit strategic document may also acknowledge that in some situations the communication of the deterrent threat will be delivered privately.\n²¹ For further discussion of costly signals, cheap talk, and deterrence, see Fearon (2002, 13–16), Lupton (2018, 64), but also see Danilovic (2002, 130–40).\nIn addition, studying cyber deterrence strategy adoption makes more effective use of the methodological solutions traditional deterrence scholars offer to the challenges of exploring this strategy. First, scholars have pointed in different ways to the need to selectively choose case studies, such as studying critical cases of deterrence failure, or studying enduring rivals. While the main solution this article offers is somewhat different—focusing on the adoption/employment of the strategy—in fact, these solutions complement each other: for example, exploring the adoption, changes, and abandoning of cyber deterrence strategies over time between enduring rivals.\nOther solutions have aimed to better establish the causal mechanism (of deterrence success). Because of the observability of both cyber deterrence adoption and the elements that may account for it, the solution of developing specific hypotheses about the defender, the challenger, and the situation is useful direction to take. Scholars can observe the characteristics of cyber deterrence strategy adoption (e.g. explicitness, timing, the type of the cyber deterrence, the means to establish it, and the kind of challenge it aims to dissuade). In a similar way, scholars can provide various factors affecting such adoption, including elements of perceptions, culture, and norms on the one hand, and the strategic utility of the strategy on the other. Likewise, as further discussed below, they may explore the social context in which the strategy is embedded.\nFocusing on the adoption of the strategy is closely related to another solution advised by traditional deterrence scholars—that is, to rely on primary sources. Strategy adoption, being observable, provides sources to empirically establish the study of cyber deterrence. However, focusing on adoption also opens up other types of sources. Strategic documents establish the employment of the strategy, such as the US Department of Defense Cyberspace Policy Report, Department of Defense Defense Science Board, and the Department of Defense Cyber Strategy. Other relevant sources help to understand and explain how actors adopt cyber deterrence strategy, in this way exploring the various elements presented above. For example, primary documents that trace how perceptions on cyber (domain) change over time and how the cyber (domain) is constructed (e.g. in Raymond 2019, 203--35) could provide an account of changes in actors' willingness to employ this strategy in the cyber domain.\nThe methodological solution I propose—focusing on the adoption and employment of the strategy rather on deterrence success—provides important indications of actors' perceptions of the strategy's effectiveness. Scholars can explore specific cases and conduct longitudinal and cross-sectional comparisons of actors who adopt (or refrain from adopting) cyber deterrence strategy. For example, a growing international tendency to rely on this strategy may imply increasing effectiveness of the strategy or at least an increase in the perception of its effectiveness. Indeed, there are different explanations as to why actors adopt and employ a strategy of (cyber) deterrence—and these should be explored. Nonetheless, given the limited access to information about deterrence success, solutions based on focusing on the strategy's adoption provide important alternatives.\nTechnological developments provide one explanation (or hypothesis) for the adoption of cyber deterrence strategy. For example, given the problem of attribution, technologies that help defenders trace the source of an attack may enhance this strategy's efficiency and hence its attractiveness. In a similar way, improvements in defensive measures, measures to increase resilience, and organization skills in operating these measures (Slayton 2017, 89--90, e.g. Matania and Tal-Shir 2020) may make strategies of deterrence by denial more attractive. While these are plausible hypotheses, we cannot reduce the adoption of (cyber) deterrence strategies to technological advancement. Other explanations could be developed, for example,\nA Methodology for Cyber Deterrence Research\nbased on actors' (strategic) culture (e.g., Knopf 2013, 9–10).²³ A number of reviews of cyber security policies and strategies of different countries (e.g., Luijjf, Besseling, Spoelstra, and De Graaf 2013; Liveri and Sarri 2014; Baezner and Cordey 2019) provide not only the social context of cyber deterrence strategies, but also information to help explain their adoption (or lack thereof). The strategic, political, and cultural elements these reports review are useful points of departure toward that goal.\nInternational norms could also affect the adoption of cyber deterrence strategy. Nye, for example, suggests that deterrence through the establishment of international norms is one means of employing cyber deterrence. This strategy is based on creating taboos that increase the costs of attacking certain cyber targets (e.g., civilian cyber infrastructures) (Nye 20167, 60–62). From this perspective, the emergence of norms incentivizes actors to rely on practices of deterrence and adopt and employ them. Furthermore, the emergence of new norms can also affect other types of deterrence strategy, including deterrence by punishment. Actors may be more motivated to adopt such a strategy, for example, if cyberattacks are constructed as acts of violence. Seeing a challenge as “violent” increases an actor’s willingness to employ threats to dissuade it, thus enhancing deterrence effectiveness. The existence of a norm that portrays cyberattacks in this way legitimizes a retaliatory strike and thus the adoption of this strategy in the first place (Lupovici 2016a, 333–34).²⁴ In recent years, scholars have begun to explore how public perceptions of cyber conflicts and dynamics affect support for retaliation against cyberattacks (Kreps and Schneider 2019; Shandler, Gross, and Canetti 2021). Public attitudes open up a broad area for research connecting normative, political, and institutional factors that also affect the adoption of cyber deterrence strategies.\n## Diversifying Cyber Deterrence Research\nBy focusing on the strategy’s adoption, we can examine and compare various kinds of actors, especially actors other than those commonly examined. In particular, the United States is overrepresented in the research. There are a number of reasons for this—including that many scholars are American and aim to influence the US strategy, that the United States is considered a cyber power, and the greater availability of American documents. Therefore, US cyber deterrence will probably continue to be closely examined.\nHowever, the observability of the adoption and employment of the strategy makes information on other cases also relatively accessible, which may help to fill the gap and advance our understanding of other countries. One of the research puzzles concerns actors who have not adopted an explicit cyber deterrence strategy—Israel being a key example. Despite the fact that deterrence is a strategy Israel has adopted vis-à-vis various threats (Lupovici 2016b), so far Israel has refrained from issuing direct cyber deterrent threats.\nDiversifying the research to include other states is also intriguing given the differing views on the strategy of deterrence and cyber security. Studying whether and how these actors adopt and employ cyber deterrence strategies helps to develop a more nuanced understanding of what cyber deterrence is and why and how it is used.\nWe can also extend the study of cyber deterrence to explore non-state actors. In recent years, deterrence scholarship has started to acknowledge other actors involved in the practices of deterrence (Paul, Morgan, and Wirtz 2009). Scholars have explored not only how states attempt to deter non-states threats (e.g., Wilner 2015, 37–74), but also how different kinds of non-state actors, such as terrorist\n²³I discuss below some more specific cultural explanations for adopting a strategy of deterrence.\n²⁴For further discussion on the question of “violence,” use of force, cyberattacks, and legitimate retaliation, see Waxman (2011), Harrison Dinniss (2012, 63–75), Schmitt (2017, chapter 14, 16), and Schneider (2019a, 115).\nAMIR LUPOVICI\n1689\norganizations, issue deterrent threats, including against state actors (e.g., Sobelman 2016). Emerging research on the cyber domain acknowledged the increasing importance of non-state actors in world politics, specifically in international security (Carr 2011; Valeriano and Maness 2015, 164–87; Maurer 2018). However, these notions have rarely been used to explore non-state cyber actors’ involvement in the practices of deterrence, especially their adoption of deterrent strategy and issuing of deterrent threats (but see Teplinsky 2013, 319–21; Burton 2018, 18–21, 23–25; Wilner 2020, 268, 272–73, Lilli 2021). It may be difficult to access this information; however, it will be more accessible than direct information on cases of cyber deterrence successes these actors are involved in.\n## Inviting Plural Research Methods\nThe study of the adoption and employment of cyber deterrence strategies invites positivist and interpretative methods. Positivist scholars can study causal mechanisms of this phenomenon through quantitative and qualitative methods. Scholars can focus on specific case studies or conduct longitudinal and cross-sectional comparative works on actors who adopted, were late to adopt, or did not adopt cyber deterrence strategy.\nFocusing on adoption is a promising direction for examining whether, how, and why an actor adopts and employs a certain type of cyber deterrence strategy. One option is to explore the evolution of the strategy: for example, by tracing a shift in a state’s cyber strategy. The changes in 2018 in US cyber policy provide a useful demonstration of these dynamics, illustrating the advantages of the suggested framework. In 2018, the United States adopted a cyber strategy based on *defend forward* and *persistent engagement* (e.g., compare Department of Defense 2011 with Department of Defense 2018; see also Healey 2019; Kosseff 2019, 5; Wilner 2020, 266–67). While there is debate over how far this strategy diverts from an emphasis on deterrence, experts ascribe the shift to the limited applicability of deterrence strategy in the cyber domain (e.g., Fischerkeller and Harknett 2017; see also King and Gallagher 2020, 27–28).²⁵\nThis policy change led to some interesting questions. Foremost, the timing of this shift is worth exploring. Doubts over the effectiveness of cyber deterrence strategy were expressed as early as the 1990s. This implies that the 2018 change was informed by notions beyond those of the limitations of cyber deterrence strategy—for example, by the acknowledgment that adversaries in cyber space are in constant contact (e.g., Fischerkeller and Harknet 2017; Fischerkeller, Harknett, and Vičić 2020, 25–30). This shows that acceptance of new ideas and their successful promotion by individuals and networks may also be crucial in accounting for this change. Healey suggests that the change “stems directly from this Goldman–Fischerkeller–Harknett lineage (and subsequently drove the DoD Cyber Strategy and parts of the White House National Cyber Strategy). This is perhaps unsurprising “as all three are international relations scholars who have worked at US Cyber Command” (Healey 2019, 5). Processes of learning, persuasion, and individual characteristics can all help to explain whether and how cyber deterrence strategy is shifting, accepted, and employed.²⁶\nLearning may be also seen as a result of cyberattacks experienced by the United States, which led practitioners to emphasize the need to shift to persistent engagement. Whyte (2020a, 210–11) summarizes this point: “[N]umerous commentators . . . note the significance of Russian political warfare in 2016 as a realisation mo\n²⁵ Likewise, Libicki concludes that the United States should not make cyber deterrence an explicit strategy and that it should not rely on it (Libicki 2016, 266).\n²⁶ For similar dynamics regarding learning nuclear deterrence, see Kaplan (1991), Adler (1992), and Evangelista (1999). These studies show, in different ways, that although technological developments are crucial, they are insufficient to account for the adoption of deterrence strategies.\nA Methodology for Cyber Deterrence Research\nment prompting the development of the new, more assertive strategy.” Structural changes also allowed for and guided this shift. For example, comparing the 2018 cyber strategy with its predecessor (DoD 2015), Kollars and Schneider (2018) note “The 2018 Cyber Strategy reflects the changes in the political, technical, and institutional environment over the last three years.”\nAnother research direction that focuses on the adoption of the strategy could examine the exact nature, rather the efficiency, of the strategy²⁷: that is, examining whether and which type of deterrence strategy the new adopted policy aims to advance. Scholars have debated over whether the 2018 strategy emphasizes deterrence strategy (see, Healey 2019, 3–4). On the one hand, it was developed and justified based on the limits of cyber deterrence as discussed above. For example, Kreps and Schneider (2019, 9) assert that persistent engagement is better suited than deterrence. According to them, “[D]eterrence hinges on public resolve for overwhelming uses of force and a willingness to escalate, which appears lacking in the cyber domain, whereas persistent engagement can operate at a lower intensity of confrontation—albeit one that is relatively continuous—that gains legitimacy by virtue of the public support.”\nNonetheless, while experts acknowledge the shift in the US strategy, they also point to different types of deterrence strategy that the new policy emphasizes and to how it might actually enhance the US deterrent posture. For Whyte (2020a, 210), the new strategy marks a shift from deterrence by denial to a kind of deterrence by punishment. Likewise, Kollars and Schneider (2018) identify a specific shift in US strategy toward tailored deterrence against China and Russia, compared with a former comprehensive cyber deterrence strategy vis-à-vis a “wide array of actors and actions.” Furthermore, persistent engagement based on offensive action might strengthen deterrence strategy by signaling resolve and establishing escalation dominance (Kollars and Schneider 2018; Miller and Pollard 2019; Valeriano and Jensen 2019). In a similar way, the US Cyber Command Vision statement implements the idea of persistent engagement as a way to enhance the US deterrent posture. According to this document, “Through persistent action and competing more effectively below the level of armed conflict, we can influence the calculations of our adversaries, deter aggression, and clarify the distinction between acceptable and unacceptable behavior in cyberspace” (USCYBERCOM 2018, 6).\nThese discussions demonstrate not only the importance of looking into a cyber (deterrence) strategy, explaining it, and analyzing its components, but also the feasibility of conducting such research. Although, scholars can interpret the evidence differently, and the meaning and implications of the strategy may change over time, there is accessible and important evidence to work with. Furthermore, it helps to demonstrate how the suggested methodology provides an alternative to the challenges of studying deterrence success. While we still have little information about the outcomes of this strategy, we can start by considering the various aspects of its adoption.\nIn addition to focusing on one case study or on shifts in actors’ cyber deterrence strategy, such as the those discussed above (the case of Israel response in May 2020 and the 2018 US policy), scholars can also conduct broader comparisons. These can explore the reasons for the differences in how countries adopt and employ cyber deterrence strategies or compare an actor’s adoption and employment of cyber deterrence strategy with its adoption and employment of deterrence strategy\n²⁷ The idea of persistent engagement sparked a debate over whether and to what extent cyber operations are effective in attaining strategic goals, and specifically whether and how they contribute to cyber deterrence success. While scholars acknowledged a number of advantages of the new policy, they were also worried that the criteria for success of this new strategy are not entirely clear; that employing it might be too costly; that it might lead to escalation; and that it may deteriorate US relationships with its allies (Healey 2019, 7–11; Lin and Smeets 2019; Miller and Pollard 2019; Smeets 2019a; Schneider 2019b; Smeets 2019b; Valeriano and Jensen 2019).\nAMIR LUPOVICI\n1691\nin other domains.²⁸ Likewise, we can study the diverse effects of the emergence of international norms on different actors. Scholars may also look into changes over time in how an actor adopts and employs its cyber deterrence strategy. The deterrent threat and the deterrent means may become more or less explicit, the putative challengers may be named (or not), and over time actors may remove or add means and different methods for practicing cyber deterrence.\nAn obvious advantage here is the access to comparable information and data. Scholars, thus, not only can conduct quantitative research that explores different aspects of the adoption of cyber deterrence strategies, but can also use data sets already available. This direction accords with Pytlak and Mitchell’s (2016, 79) recommendation to develop new techniques to address and use data in a way that overcomes the limited “amount of information publicly available.”\nBased on the data collected and analyzed by Brantly (2016), Valeriano, Jensen, and Maness (2018), and Kostyuk and Zhukov (2019), scholars are able to develop interesting notions about the adoption of deterrence strategy. For example, following these studies, it is possible to ask whether actors who absorbed significant cyberattacks tend to consider adopting cyber deterrence strategies to balance their insecurities, or whether more powerful actors tend to rely on this strategy, for example, based on long-term deterrence through previous execution of cyber means (i.e., cumulative cyber deterrence).²⁹ These notions fit some of the assertions Valeriano et al. make, such as those about credibility and signaling (Valeriano, Jensen, and Maness 2018, 46–47), as well as about the long-term aims of cyber operations (Valeriano, Jensen, and Maness 2018, 11). Similarly, the cyber power score Brantly (2016, 138–40, 169) develops enables some hypotheses about the adoption of cyber deterrence strategies: for example, whether weaker states tend to adopt deterrence strategies to balance their inferiority (e.g., explicitly adopt the strategy) or to avoid it, fearing that adopting it will contribute to escalation. Based on these data, scholars can also compare whether and why different actors adopt different types of cyber deterrence strategies: for example, whether weaker actors rely on strategies such as deterrence by naming and shaming or deterrence by detection.\nThe suggested methodology based on studying the adoption of the strategy not only enables positivistic studies, but may also fit well with interpretative frameworks and research on deterrence. Interpretative scholars who study deterrence have started to employ discourse analysis to examine the practices of deterrence (Cohn 1987; Luke 1989; Dauber 1993; Harrington 2016; Vuori 2016). While these methods have not been fully applied to study cyber deterrence, this could be done through focusing on the adoption and employment of the strategy and on the language used. One specific promising direction is to study the adoption and employment of deterrence as securitizing moves (Lupovici 2019). Scholars have started to explore different securitizing moves related to cyber (Bendrath, Eriksson, and Giacomello 2007; Dunn Cavelty 2008; Hansen and Nissenbaum 2009; Deibert and Rohozinski 2010; Dunn Cavelty 2013; Stevens 2016). Looking into the adoption of cyber deterrence strategy provides intriguing cases to further apply the theory of securitization to traditional security challenges. This direction may cover various securitizing moves: for example, the American attempt to securitize cyber challenges to justify various means of retaliation, including even nuclear weapons, in the case of an “existential cyber attack” (Department of Defense 2013, 42; see also Wilner 2020, 261).\nIn a similar way, interpretative approaches highlight the importance of the social context in which deterrence strategy is embedded. These notions can be also ap-\n²⁸ One goal of comparing cyber deterrence with deterrence in other domains is to validate the assertion that the adoption of cyber deterrence may indicate, even indirectly, deterrence success, as discussed above.\n²⁹ Likewise, reports that document cyber incidents may also prove useful in tracing previous cyber operations and their influence on actors’ adoption of cyber deterrence strategies; see, for example, the project of the Council on Foreign Relations at https://www.cfr.org/cyber-operations.\nA Methodology for Cyber Deterrence Research\nplied to study cyber deterrence: for example, in examining how the strategy's adoption and employment are shaped by international norms, (strategic) culture, and actors' identity. This is important to better understand how and why actors adopt cyber deterrence strategies, but also because the way the strategy is adopted indicates and reflects political, normative, and cultural elements. Although scholars have not used these elements to study cyber deterrence adoption (but see Adamsky 2018), they have explained deterrence strategy adoption and employment in other domains by pointing to strategic culture (Basrur 2006, 49–79; Adamsky 2017, 166–71), norms (Tannenwald 2007, 45, 291–92), practices (Adler and Pouliot 2011, 9–15, 21–28), rituals (Mälksoo 2021), and actors' identity, emotions, and ontological security (Tannenwald 2007, 45–46; Lupovici 2016b). The adoption and employment of cyber deterrence strategy provide another arena to examine and employ these theories.\n# Conclusions\nThis article suggests that focusing on the adoption and employment of cyber deterrence strategy—rather than studying cyber deterrence success—promises to provide solutions to the methodological challenges associated with the study of this strategy. This article does not claim to advance the only way to explore cyber deterrence. On the contrary, scholars may well find methodological alternatives, as there is still need to collect and analyze data and case studies on deterrence failure/success. Nonetheless, based on clarifying methodological challenges and by offering a categorization of different characteristics of how (cyber) deterrence strategies are adopted, I point to a phenomenon that has received insufficient attention, and studying it carries a number of advantages. Among other things, it provides methodological solutions, it helps diversify the research of deterrence, and it invites plural approaches and methods. This paper thus should be seen as a point of departure for further research and as a call to focus on the adoption and employment of the strategy.\nMore generally, I suggest that elaborating on these issues contributes not only to the study of cyber deterrence, but also to the two fields of research: deterrence and cyber. For the former, the advantage lies in reframing methodological problems and challenges that may be relevant for scholars who explore not only cyber deterrence. Another advantage for deterrence research, in general, lies in studying an understudied phenomenon. More scholarly work has been done on the adoption and employment of deterrence strategies (mainly of nuclear deterrence, e.g., Kaplan 1991; Adler 1992; Evangelista 1999; Freedman and Michaels 2019) than on the adoption of cyber deterrence strategies. Nonetheless, while the study of deterrence strategy adoption lags behind the study of deterrence success, it may well complement it. From this perspective, this article provides a first step in developing a methodology to study the adoption and employment of different types of deterrence strategies in different domains and with different deterrent means.\nThis is, furthermore, an important phenomenon on its own. It may indicate various aspects about actors' strategic thinking, perceptions, culture, and identity. Understanding how, when, and why actors adopt and employ deterrence strategies (or change or abandon them) in various domains may also further the study of cyber deterrence adoption and employment. The study of more traditional strategies of deterrence may reveal additional explanations and possible characteristics to examine, explain, and compare. Conversely, studying the adoption of cyber deterrence may advance the study of more traditional strategies of deterrence. Most notably, studying cyber deterrence emphasizes that adoption of deterrence strategies cannot be taken as given but requires explanation. It also reveals our assumptions in studying deterrence. For example, traditional studies of deterrence take as given that the challenge is an act of violence or that the timing of the attack and the tim\nAMIR LUPOVICI\n1693\ning of the damage for the defender are the same. Studying cyber deterrence shows that these notions have implications for the practice of deterrence and for the study of it.\nRegarding cyber studies, exploring the strategy's adoption may account for changes in actors' behavior. In other words, studying cyber deterrence adoption demonstrates how technological and normative changes affect cyber strategies. In a similar way, we can study how culture, on the one hand, and rational calculations, on the other hand, affect behavior in the cyber domain. Studying cyber deterrence adoption makes cyber behavior more observable. Therefore, we can draw implications from it that go beyond those related solely to deterrence.\n## Acknowledgments\nI would like to thank Patricia Greve, Gallia Lindenstrauss, and the three anonymous reviewers for their extremely helpful comments and suggestions on different drafts of this manuscript.

Studying cyber deterrence presents even greater challenges, as traditional deterrence challenges are exacerbated and interactions in the cyber domain create further difficulties. When studying cyber deterrence, scholars face uncertainty not only in identifying situations of deterrence success, but also—due to the secrecy surrounding cyber practices—in identifying situations of deterrence failure. Despite the many studies on cyber deterrence, methodological solutions to address these challenges still need to be developed. To this end, I suggest focusing on the adoption and employment of the strategy rather than on its success. I argue that since communicating threats is a core element of deterrence, it is easier to observe how the strategy is adopted and employed than whether it succeeds or fails. This focus provides a promising direction to study cyber deterrence and address these challenges.\nEl estudio de disuasión presenta una serie de desafíos, principalmente relacionados con la identificación de casos de éxito de disuasión y la definición de su funcionamiento. El estudio de la ciberdisuasión presenta desafíos aún mayores, ya que los desafíos tradicionales de la disuasión se ven exacerbados y las interacciones en el ámbito cibernético generan más dificultades. Al estudiar la ciberdisuasión, los académicos se enfrentan a la incertidumbre no solo a la hora de identificar situaciones de éxito de disuasión, sino también a la hora de identificar situaciones de fracaso de disuasión debido a la confidencialidad que gira en torno a las prácticas cibernéticas. A pesar de los numerosos estudios sobre la ciberdisuasión, todavía es necesario desarrollar soluciones metodológicas para abordar estos desafíos. Para lograrlo, sugiero enfocarse en la adopción e implementación de la estrategia más que en su éxito. Sostengo que, dado que comunicar amenazas es un elemento clave de la disuasión, es más fácil observar cómo se adopta e implementa la estrategia que identificar si tiene éxito o fracasa. Este enfoque marca un rumbo prometedor para estudiar la ciberdisuasión y abordar estos desafíos.\nL'étude de la dissuasion présente un certain nombre de défis qui sont principalement liés à l'identification de la réussite de la dissuasion et à la définition de la manière dont la dissuasion fonctionne.

While scholars have pointed to the challenges of practicing cyber deterrence, their focus—like that of most deterrence scholars—has been on deterrence success. Most studies assess whether and how deterrence by punishment can be applied to the cyber domain (e.g., in Wilner 2020, 252–54), or whether and how it should be replaced with other strategies or types of deterrence, such as deterrence by denial (Iasiello 2013), or by cumulative deterrence (Tor 2017). These studies are part of the tendency Stevens (2016, 24) observes of cyber security studies to be “commonly oriented towards policy concerns.” Nonetheless, less attention is given to methodological challenges around studying cyber deterrence. This article aims to advance the methodology of studying (cyber) deterrence by offering a categorization of the methodological challenges concerning studying deterrence and by offering an alternative way to explore this strategy.\nInspired by the dog that did not bark problem—a bias in the study of deterrence toward cases of deterrence failure (Sauer 2016, 49)—I categorize three clusters of problems regarding the study of deterrence. Besides the dog that did not bark problem, I group additional challenges into two clusters of problems that I term the dog that did bark and the dog that should have barked problems. The former refers to challenges around interpreting cases of deterrence success and failure, and the latter to a bias that stems from the difficulty of identifying attacks and therefore seeing them as deterrence failures.\nBased on this categorization, I review and illustrate the challenges in studying cyber deterrence and the limited applicability of the current solutions offered to address them. These challenges include identifying deterrence success, selecting appropriate cases, and establishing causal connections between issuing the deterrent threat and deterrence success. While these problems generally characterize the study of deterrence, they are exacerbated in studying cyber deterrence, mainly because we cannot observe cyber deterrence successes and failures.\nI claim that one way to solve the challenges in studying cyber deterrence strategy is to shift focus from deterrence success to its adoption and employment. While this is\nStudying the adoption of cyber deterrence strategies overlaps with broader attempts to explore the motivation behind cyber strategies (e.g., Valeriano, Jensen, and Maness 2018; Gomez 2021).\nA Methodology for Cyber Deterrence Research\nnot the only solution—and indeed scholars still need to study deterrence success—I assert it provides a useful point of departure for thinking about and exploring this strategy.\nA number of scholars have begun to study the adoption of cyber deterrence strategies with illuminating insights (Kugler 2009, 311–13; Stevens 2012; Adamsky 2018; Healey 2019; Gold 2020, 8–21; Wilner 2020). While I rely on this scholarship, I also aim to advance it. The main goal for most of these works is to describe the evolution of the strategy rather than to explain the phenomenon of adopting the strategy. I suggest that using the adoption and employment of the strategy as the explained phenomenon (i.e., *explanandum*) is a promising method because of the observability of these aspects of the strategy. Communicating threats is a core element of a deterrence strategy, which makes the strategy’s adoption and employment much more explicit than its success or failure. This allows me to offer a categorization of how actors diverge in adopting and applying deterrence strategies, based on the goal, type, means, and explicitness of the strategy. This in turn provides a useful framework to study deterrence, and especially cyber deterrence strategies. Furthermore, as I demonstrate below, the study of the adoption and employment of cyber deterrence strategies encourages methodological pluralism, open to both positivist and interpretative methods.\nThe article proceeds as follows: In the first section, I discuss the main problems in the study of deterrence and the main solutions scholars offer to address them. In the second part, I specify the increased pressure of these challenges when studying cyber deterrence and argue that most solutions are not sufficient to remedy the problems. The third section develops a methodology for studying cyber deterrence, based on different characteristics that concern the adoption of the strategy. The fourth section shows and illustrates the promise of focusing on the adoption and employment of cyber deterrence to address the challenges. Such focus provides new research questions, explanations, and hypotheses, and diversifies the research of this strategy. I conclude by discussing the implications of this study on deterrence research in general and on cyber security research.\n## Methodological Challenges in Studying Deterrence\nScholars studying deterrence have paid a great deal of attention to methodological issues. While it is beyond this paper’s scope to discuss all the methodological challenges in the study of deterrence, I group the main challenges into three clusters. The first is based on what scholars refer to as the dog that did not bark problem. Building on this, I introduce two further problems: the dog that did bark and the dog that should have barked (see table 1).\n## The Dog That Did Not Bark\nThe dog that did not bark problem revolves around selection bias in studying cases of deterrence failure. Scholars are referring to Sherlock Holmes’ ability to solve a murder mystery based on the fact that a dog, present at the night of the murder, did not bark. Key to solving the case is the idea that there is meaning in the fact that something did not happen. The dog did not bark because the dog knew the perpetrator (see also Sauer 2016, 49). Based on this analogy, scholars have pointed to the flawed tendency to focus only on cases of deterrence failure, which provide\nFor reviews and comparisons of cyber strategies of different countries, see Thomas (2009), Lewis and Neuneck (2013), Luiijf, Besseling, Spoelstra, and De Graaf (2013), Liveri and Sarri (2014), and Baezner and Cordey (2019). See also King and Gallagher (2020, 144–45).\nThe debates over how to study deterrence, advanced not only research on deterrence and security, but also, and more broadly, studies in international relations (IR) and political science (e.g., see in King, Keohane, and Verba 1994, 24,134–35).\nAMIR LUPOVICI\n\nTable 1. Clusters of methodological challenges in the study of deterrence and cyber deterrence\n|  The problem | Description | Implications for the study of deterrence | Implications for the study of cyber deterrence  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  The dog that did not bark | The fact that the dog did not bark during a murder means something. In other words, it is important to analyze events that did not happen. | Scholars need to study not only cases of deterrence failure, but also cases of deterrence success (where allegedly nothing happens). However, the research suffers from a selection bias. Given the difficulties of studying cases of deterrence success, scholars tend to focus on studying cases of deterrence failure. | The selection bias is more challenging. Given the secrecy that surrounds interactions in the cyber domain, identifying cases of deterrence success is much more difficult, which further biases the study toward studying cases of deterrence failure.  |\n|  The dog that did bark | Interpreting events is very difficult. Dog’s barking does not necessarily mean that there was a murder, and vice versa (if the dog did not bark it does not mean that there was no murder). | Not only is the line between deterrence failure and success not clear-cut, but interpreting whether deterrence succeeded or failed based on the level of violence is problematic. Eruption of violence is not proof of deterrence failure, as lack of violence is not proof of deterrence success. | Interpreting events and concluding deterrence failure and success from observations is even more challenging given the secrecy surrounding cyber incidents and the ambiguity concerning what should be considered as violent attack (which constitute deterrence failure). Therefore, scholars face difficulties in classifying cases and in establishing (causal) explanations.  |\n|  The dog that should have barked | When the dog is not fully aware of the presence of a suspicious person, and therefore is not barking (e.g., in case of a murder, the dog is failing to notice or is noticing too late). | This challenge poses another sort of case selection bias, as obviously scholars are only able to study the cases they are aware of. | Scholars are not only biased toward studying cases of deterrence failure as indicated by the traditional challenge of studying deterrence. In cases of cyber deterrence, scholars are also not fully aware of cases of deterrence failure. This biases the research in different ways, including scholars’ tendency to focus on a limited number of known case studies of cyber deterrence failure for which relatively more information is available.  |\nA Methodology for Cyber Deterrence Research\nconsiderable observable traces to follow—the employment of violence by at least one of the parties (Achen and Snidal 1989, 161; Lebow and Stein 1990, 336, 347; King, Keohane, and Verba 1994, 24). Positivist scholars use this analogy to challenge scholars' ability to provide a full coloration given that they focus on one possible value of the examined variable of deterrence success—that is, deterrence failure. Some scholars have even suggested the problem is deeper, since focusing on deterrence failures leads to exploration of much more resolute actors—those “who select themselves into crises” and therefore are less likely to be deterred (Danilovic 2002, 117–19; Fearon 2002, 6, 14; see also Wilner 2015, 190, footnote 4, p. 241).\nWhile the problematic tendency to focus on cases of deterrence failure clearly exists, it should be noted that lack of violence is not a nonoccurrence. As Tannenwald, emphasizes, \"[T]here is no such thing as explaining a non-event . . . What is actually being explained is a contrast between an actual event and a possible alternative counterfactual event.\" What we are in fact asking is not why the dog did not bark, but why the dog was silent, as we have a reasonable expectation that in such situations the counterfactual (e.g., barking) is a likely scenario (Tannenwald 2007, 30). From this perspective, when deterrence succeeds (and there is no violence) something does happen: policymakers decide that the cost of violence is too high for them to pursue the act the defender aims to prevent. Put differently, it is not that nothing happened, but rather that we cannot easily see it.\n## The Dog That Did Bark\nI use the phrase the dog that did bark to refer to difficulties around interpreting observations. We cannot deduce an occurrence from an event that correlates with another event. Usually dogs bark when they notice a suspicious person (e.g., a potential murderer); however, of course, we cannot deduce, just because a dog barked that a murder has taken place. Similarly, in the absence of suspicious activity, dogs do not bark. But the fact a dog did not bark does not mean no crime occurred. This analogy allows us to group a number of challenges around determining deterrence failure and success and their implications.\nNotably, the eruption of violence does not necessarily indicate deterrence failure. First, deterrence success is not a binary variable. For example, some scholars argue that, unlike nuclear deterrence, in cases of low(er) levels of violence, decreasing the amount of violence can be considered deterrence success even if it does not totally prevent the violence (Rid 2012; Wenger and Wilner 2012, 318). Second, paradoxically, in some cases, deterrence success increases the level of violence, as an opponent can execute a challenge to provoke retaliation in order to attain political gain.\nNonetheless, not only can we not deduce deterrence failure from violence, but, and more importantly, we cannot deduce deterrence success from observing lack of violence. For example, there may be no challenger. As Morgan (2003, 121) argues, if a state \"has no intention of attacking the case cannot tell us whether deterrence works and how.\" In addition, even if the challenger has motivation to attack the defender, it may refrain for reasons other than the deterrent posture of the defender.\n\nAMIR LUPOVICI\n\n## The Dog That Should Have Barked\nWhile the two challenges presented above—the dog that did not bark and the dog that did bark—group and refer to known problems and biases in the study of deterrence, the dog that should have barked emphasizes a less-studied challenge. This problem stems from the expectation that the dog needs to bark if something suspicious is happening. As noted above, the counterfactual is that if the dog did not bark, it means something. However, inspired by this analogy we can also create a third cluster: a situation where the dog did not bark, but should have. While this can be seen as a subcategory of the dog that did not bark problem, the counterfactual here is different. Unlike the original, in which the dog had no reason to bark, in this situation, if the dog were aware of the occurrence, then it would definitely be barking. Nonetheless, the dog that should have barked problem also differs from the dog that did bark problem. The dog that did bark points to a situation in which the occurrence is known but its meaning is not. In the dog that should have barked, not only is the interpretation unclear, but what happened remains a mystery.\nFor the purpose of the study of deterrence, this analogy emphasizes situations in which practitioners are unaware of what happened, or at least of situations that have no public record.7 This means that scholars are limited in using these cases. Not only are they unaware of cases of deterrence success (as evident in the dog that did not bark problem), but they may also be unaware of cases of deterrence failure.\n## Current Solutions in Scholarship\nThe dog that did not bark and what I term the dog that did bark point to three main challenges in the study of deterrence: (1) bias in case selection; (2) difficulty of determining deterrence success and deterrence failure, and thus of classifying case studies; and (3) problems in establishing causality, that is, in showing that there is not only a correlation between the issuing of the threats and the avoidance of violence, but that the deterrent threat causes it (George and Smoke 1974, 90–93; Luke 1989, 214; Lebow and Stein 1990, 345; Freedman 2004, 13). Scholars offer a number of solutions to these challenges.\nFirst, scholars urge careful selection of case studies. Among other things, they recommend exploring critical case studies of deterrence failure (Lebow and Stein 1989, 221–22). In addition, Huth and Russett suggest focusing on immediate deterrence rather than on cases of general deterrence. Immediate deterrence is characterized by explicit threats or the movement of alerting military forces, and thus it provides the observer with “reasonable assessment of whether deterrence succeeded or failed” (Huth and Russett 1988, 30). Also, they suggest examining cases of both deterrence failure and deterrence success (Huth and Russett 1990,\ninvolvement in Syria since 2012 and especially since 2013, and the pressure from Iran not to waste resources (Lupovici 2016b, 183).\n7These situations usually result from what Baliga, Bueno De Mesquita, and Wolitzky (2020, 1055) refer to as detection failure, where defenders are unaware that an attack occurred.\nA Methodology for Cyber Deterrence Research\n468–73). However, as Jervis asserts, this solution is limited, as the important question is why deterrence fails and not the frequency of deterrence failures (Jervis 1989, 194).\nSecond, scholars suggest examining the long-term dynamics of enduring rivals to address a number of challenges in the study of deterrence (Stein 1996; Lieberman 2013; Danilovic and Clare 2017, 14–15). This enables the exploration not only of immediate deterrence, but also of general deterrence. Morgan (2003, 82) suggests that focusing only on crises is problematic since it prevents studying the inter-crises periods, which are crucial because actors often attempt to employ general deterrence strategy. Focusing on enduring rivals also addresses the bias in studying mainly cases of deterrence failure. It helps to establish the causal connections by addressing questions around whether the challenger seriously considered war or, if the challenger backed down, whether it was affected by the defender’s deterrent strategy. In addition, it helps to establish a more focused comparison because the same actors are examined over time. Finally, studying enduring rivals also addresses the challenge of identifying the defender and the challenger, by revealing shifts in actors’ balance of interests (Lieberman 2013, 29–32; see also Stein 1996).\nThird, scholars suggest dealing with the challenge of identifying deterrence success by developing hypotheses about the defender, the challenger, and the conflict (Stern, Axelrod, Jervis, and Rander 1989, 6, 19–21, 33). While this solution complements some other solutions, it leads in practice to debates around results without necessarily providing convincing explanations. A prime example of these limitations is the study of whether the actual use of force contributes to enhancing a deterrent posture and demonstrating resolve (Schelling 1966, 116–25; Mercer 1996; Press 2005; Tang 2005; Rid 2012, 128; Lupton 2018, 61–66). This issue is highly debated, and scholars suggest the empirical findings on it are inconclusive and that further research is needed (Huth 1997; Sartori 2005, 9; Weisiger and Yarhi-Milo 2015, 479).\nFourth, scholars have advised relying on primary sources and detailed historical accounts to better determine the defender and challenger and to better establish deterrence success (or failure). This will also decrease selection bias in the study of deterrence (Lebow and Stein 1990, 346–51). Following these ideas, Wilner (2011, 32–33), for example, suggests that primary sources are crucial to establishing the putative challenger’s intentions and how they change. While use of primary sources is promising, a common problem is the difficulty of accessing the kind of evidence needed. Leaders’ statements may not be sincere, especially around the effect of the deterrent threat on behavior. As Morgan asserts, the challenger “won’t announce that it backed down because it was scared: instead, it never planned to attack” (Morgan 2003, 122; see also Huth and Russett 1990, 491). Even in private discussions, policymakers tend not to admit the effect of the opponent’s deterrence strategy (Lebow and Stein 1989, 222). The sources that help address this challenge come from closed meetings, classified policy analyses, and military orders and assessments, all of which are hard to trace (Huth and Russett 1990, 491). However, they do provide much stronger evidence of whether and how deterrent threat shapes a putative challenger’s behavior.\n## Challenges in Studying Cyber Deterrence\nThe challenges around studying conventional and nuclear deterrence are much more pressing in the context of cyber deterrence. Not only do interactions in the\n\nAMIR LUPOVICI\n\n## Cyber Deterrence Research\nMost scholars acknowledge that cyber deterrence involves the use of threats to prevent cyberattacks or attacks on defender’s information systems (Stevens 2012, 149–52; Lupovici 2016a, 324–25). Many agree that successfully employing cyber deterrence strategy is difficult (in Morgan 2010; Stevens 2012, 149–53). Among other things, they argue that defending actors cannot easily pose a credible threat because of the difficulty of identifying the challenger, the large number of potential challengers, the asymmetry between the challengers and the defenders, the low entry costs, the limited public support to retaliate against cyberattacks, and the defenders’ difficulty exposing their capabilities (Harknett 1996; Molander, Riddle, and Wilson 1996, 87; Cordesman and Cordesman 2001, 7; Arquilla 2003, 210–13; Libicki 2007, 271–72; Libicki 2009, 1–3, 26, 44–45; Morgan 2010, 55–76; Geers 2011, 111–22; Fischerkeller and Harknett 2017, 386–87; Kreps and Schneider 2019; Fischerkeller, Harknett, and Vičić 2020, 25–30).\nIndeed, some scholars suggest various methods to enhance the effectiveness of deterrence strategy in dissuading cyberattacks. Recently, scholars have become more optimistic about achieving this goal. For example, scholars offer innovative ways to think about the implications of the attribution problem and how deterrence can work under imperfect attribution (Glaser 2011, 3; Baliga, Bueno De Mesquita, and Wolitzky 2020). Scholars also suggest that the attribution problem can be addressed in various, mainly technical and technological, ways (e.g., Rid and Buchanan 2014; Egloff and Dunn Cavelty 2021) and therefore should not necessarily prevent the execution of retaliation. Furthermore, the attribution problem is not a challenge for deterrence theory per se, but is shaped through social norms that might be changed over time (Lupovici 2016a).\nScholars suggest that, in addition to deterrence by punishment, actors also rely on tailored deterrence; serial and cumulative deterrence; deterrence by denial; deterrence by naming and shaming; deterrence through the development of international norms; and deterrence by detection. Scholars also note that actors could deter by punishment through the threat of using kinetic means, and not just through cyber means (Wheatley and Hayes 1996, 13, 19–20; Cordesman and Cordesman 2001, 7; Kugler 2009; Morgan 2010, 59, 68; Glaser 2011, 4; Stevens 2012; Tor 2017; Nye 2017; Lindsay and Gartzke 2018, 192; Schneider 2019a, 109; Wilner 2020, 253). They have also suggested that cyber deterrence is more likely to be effective against a potential cyberattack that is equivalent to armed conflict. This is because in such situations, the impact of the unique characteristics of cyberspace on deterrence will be less pronounced (Fischerkeller, Harknett, and Vičić 2020, 29).\nWhile debates continue, these scholars emphasize the theoretical questions—whether and when cyber deterrence may work—and offer policy implications. Nonetheless, less attention is given to methodological questions and challenges around studying these issues, and to how evidence should be collected and analyzed.\n For a review of this scholarship, see Nye (2017); Mandel (2017, 43–64); Wilner (2020, 251–56).\n Cooper (2012, 111–18) suggests the concept of *network deterrence*. He argues that the combination of means such as punishment, futility, and dependency could strengthen deterrence effectiveness when defenders and putative challengers share a network.\nA Methodology for Cyber Deterrence Research\n## The Impact of Problems in Studying Deterrence on the Research on Cyber Deterrence\n### The Dog That Did Not Bark\nLike other studies of deterrence, cyber deterrence scholarship is biased toward focusing on cases of deterrence failure. In fact, the limited access to data and the limited evidence available to scholars result in greater research bias. This is not necessarily a problem for specific studies that focus on a small number of prominent case studies. However, it is a challenge to the scholarship as a whole. As Valeriano and Maness observe, “[c]omparative case studies are rare, given the tendency to focus on events that might be outliers,” such as Estonia (2007), Stuxnet (2010), and Sony Hack (2014), leaving aside typical cyber interactions (Valeriano and Maness 2018, 260). These overlooked interactions may include cases of deterrence success.\nThe research, then, not only tends to examine cases of deterrence failure, but also focuses on a limited number of cases. Methodologically, it is not clear to what extent these cases represent the general “population” of cases of cyber deterrence. For example, the reason that led to the availability of the case for deterrence scholars may also have affected the deterrence outcome. Given the secrecy that surrounds many cyberattack incidents, known cases of deterrence failures may indicate situations in which resolute actors chose to challenge.\n### The Dog That Did Bark\nThis problem concerns how scholars interpret observations: the challenge of establishing whether a certain case is a deterrence failure or success and thus of establishing the causal mechanism of deterrence failure/success. The secrecy around cyber incidents and the limited information available to scholars exacerbate the challenges in deterrence research (see also Burton 2018, 6; Healey and Jenkins 2019, 125). These challenges include actors’ tendency to see themselves as the defender (and not the challenger) and the difficulty of developing a more nuanced classification of deterrence success/failure: one that is not dichotomic but acknowledges that deterrence failure and deterrence success are on a continuum. In a similar way, a significant challenge is to determine what constitutes deterrence failure. While in the kinetic domains, scholars, practitioners, and law experts have over many years developed an understanding of this, it is still debated in the cyber domain (e.g., Schmitt 2017). This further complicates the academic community’s ability to interpret deterrence failure and success, and to classify cases.\nThe challenge of identifying relevant cases not only creates selection bias, but also complicates the ability to determine the impact of the deterrent threat on the putative challenger’s behavior. This difficulty is shaped by the combination of the limitation of available information on cyberattacks and the characteristics of cyberattacks, which make the temporality of the attack a key issue. In kinetic domains, the timing of the attack and of the damage is similar; and in most cases, damage follows shortly after the attack’s execution. For example, it takes a few minutes for an intercontinental missile to hit its target, and damage will follow and start impacting the defender usually less than an hour after the initiation of the attack. Because of the various modes and stages of executing cyberattacks, on the other hand, scholars have to distinguish between the timing of the attack and the timing of the damage (e.g., Brantly and Smeets forthcoming, 4–5). Challengers can better control the timing of the attack. They can predetermine the attack or use the original attack as a platform for future attacks. This increased difficulty in identifying the deterrent threat’s timing and its influence on the putative challenger’s behavior makes study of it much more onerous. Furthermore, it raises a crucial question about the meaning of deterrence success: that is, whether executing an attack can be considered deterrence failure if the damage has yet to occur. All of this inhibits our ability to interpret deterrence success or to classify cases of deterrence failure and success.\nAMIR LUPOVICI\n\nUnlike the previous two clusters of challenges, this problem mainly affects the study of cyber deterrence. While the dog that did not bark emphasizes the problems stemming from being unable to observe cases of deterrence success, this problem emphasizes problems stemming from being unable to clearly observe cases of deterrence failure.\nIn other domains, the execution of an attack leaves traces and evidence that scholars can use. These traces help scholars to determine the case as deterrence failure, as well as to examine aspects related to the execution of the challenge: for example, the damage, how it was done, and by whom. In contrast, cyberattacks usually leave fewer traces. In fact, even a significant cyberattack may not be easily traced. For example, a cyberattack may target the electricity grid but be masked as an accident or a failure of the system (see also Schneider 2019a, 114). Furthermore, in some cases, the effectiveness of cyberattacks requires that they will remain untraced. In the well-known case of Stuxnet, the worm aimed not only to damage Iranian centrifuges, but also to confuse the Iranian scientists regarding the sources of the problem (Farwell and Rohozinski 2012, 115).\nWhile the research on cyber deterrence focuses on the problem of attribution—a situation in which the source of an attack is unknown—a key difficulty concerns a more fundamental challenge: the ability to detect that there was an attack in the first place. Brantly, for example, notes that in the cyber domain it is more important “to identify that an attack is occurring . . . than to in the moment identify who is actually conducting the attack” (Brantly 2016, 87). Moreover, regardless of whether or not the victim is aware of the attack, it is a challenge for scholars, who often have limited access to such information. For this reason, some scholars state their main focus is to study compelling success rather than deterrence success. Valeriano, Jensen, and Maness (2018, 24) suggest that “[o]ur choice to focus on compelling is driven by the need to examine the efficacy of operations that seek to achieve demonstrable effects. Compreciency is about changing behavior, while deterrence is about preventing behaviors, the latter being difficult to observe empirically.”\n# The Limitations of Current Solutions\nThe solutions put forward to address challenges in studying deterrence have advanced deterrence research, but they have encountered some difficulties. Applying them to cyber deterrence studies, that focus on exploring deterrence success/failure, creates additional problems, given the unique characteristics of cyber deterrence and how knowledge around cyber incidents and cyber deterrence is produced. While common solutions may become more effective in the future, as technology changes and reliable information on cyber incidents increases, they are currently quite limited.\nOne direction for a solution is to acquire data and conduct quantitative studies based on it. While a few scholars have started to use these methods to examine cyber deterrence success or closely related behavior with interesting findings (e.g., Brantly 2016; Pytlak and Mitchell 2016),[12] they have also pointed to challenges in using data to this end (e.g., Valeriano, Jensen, and Maness 2018, 24). Others also indicate the need to develop new ways to use data given the challenges of studying this strategy (Pytlak and Mitchell 2016, 79).\nBecause of the challenges of studying cyber deterrence, it is difficult to employ the solutions discussed above based on careful selection of specific case studies—that is, focusing on critical case studies and immediate deterrence and exploring\n[12] For example, Brantly’s (2016, 143–49) findings support the assertions that actors’ ability to maintain anonymity enhances the chances for deterrence failure. Nonetheless, Pytlak and Mitchell are unable to establish significant correlation and in the end reach inconclusive interpretations of the evidence (Pytlak and Mitchell 2016, 73–79).\nA Methodology for Cyber Deterrence Research\ncases of deterrence failure as well as of deterrence success. These solutions cannot fully resolve the challenges of determining cyber incidents and identifying and classifying situations of cyber deterrence failure and success. Jervis (1989, 194) has warned that explaining deterrence failure and success is more important than explaining their frequency; this caution is even more important in studying cyber deterrence given that the cases scholars are able to examine are more biased. The challenges of case selection stem not only from the dog that did not bark problem, but also from the dog that did bark and the dog that should have barked problems—biasing cases both of deterrence success and of deterrence failure.\nLikewise, focusing on cases of immediate deterrence also becomes a challenge when studying cyber deterrence, mainly because of the lack of available information and the characteristics of cyberattacks themselves. Scholars must distinguish the time of the attack, the time of its damage, the time the defender acknowledges the attack (and the damage), and the time the attack becomes public knowledge. The defender itself may be unaware that it needs to employ an immediate deterrence threat. For example, in contrast to other domains, preparations for attacks in the cyber domain leave less traces compared to preparations of kinetic attacks and thus complicate the ability of deterrer actors to pose an immediate deterrent threat. This means that examining cases of immediate deterrence is of limited help in studying cyber deterrence: actors have fewer opportunities to perform this strategy, the existence of known cases of immediate cyber deterrence may be biased, and, most importantly, scholars may not have access to full information on these cases.\nSolutions put forward to better establish the causal connection between the deterrent threat and the challenger behavior face similar challenges. Along with the problems discussed (case selection and identification of deterrence failure and success, which also limit establishing the \"explanation\") is the limited available information on the case studies. This makes additional potential solutions impractical, such as the relying on primary sources. Likewise, while studying enduring rivals could address some of the challenges around establishing causal connections (as well as eliminating biases in case selection), it is questionable whether such enduring rivals and conflicts in the cyber domain exist, or whether scholars can acquire enough relevant information about them to allow such research. Cyber deterrence scholars, therefore, experience significant challenges because of difficulties identifying cases of deterrence success or failure. While these problems accompany the study of deterrence in general—both quantitative and qualitative works—they are worse in the study of cyber deterrence and intensify other challenges. Under these conditions, researchers need to go back to the same case studies, in this way possibly missing other important factors affecting the practices of deterrence.\n## Toward a Methodology for Studying Cyber Deterrence\nThe challenges discussed above, and the limited applicability of current solutions to address them, increase the attractiveness of an alternative methodological solution to explore cyber deterrence. While, it is impossible to fully resolve all the challenges in the study of cyber deterrence, this article provides some directions toward this goal. I advance a solution based on studying the adoption of cyber deterrence strategy. By the adoption of cyber deterrence strategy, I refer to one of two things: (1) a strategic change, in which an actor moves toward a decision to rely on at least one type of cyber deterrence strategy (e.g., punishment, denial, detection),\nOn policy decisions to reveal or conceal experiencing cyberattacks, see Baram and Sommer (2019).\nGiven how difficult it is for the defender to identify the need to issue an immediate cyber deterrence threat, the fact that a defender successfully identifies this need may itself affect its ability to issue a successful deterrent threat. Whereas in other domains the putative challenger may also attempt to disguise its attempt to attack, defender actors have more means to identify it prior to the attack.\nAMIR LUPOVICI\n\nStudying the adoption of deterrence strategies has not been given enough scholarly attention. Indeed, my exploration of this phenomenon overlaps with various studies on different types of deterrence strategies (e.g., nuclear, conventional). Some scholars, as noted above, have even started to specifically study cyber deterrence adoption (Kugler 2009, 311–13; Stevens 2012; Adamsky 2018; Healey 2019; Gold 2020, 8–21; Wilner 2020). Nonetheless, few of these studies theorize this adoption, being more interested in the historical process through which deterrence was embraced. Furthermore, these scholars do not see research on adoption of the strategy as a methodological solution to challenges in studying deterrence.\nIn contrast, I suggest focusing on the adoption of deterrence strategy as a way to address the methodological challenges of studying (cyber) deterrence. Such a focus allows scholars to explore the various ways actors adopt this strategy and to apply different methods to ascertain this phenomenon and explain it. But before detailing the advantages of studying the adoption and employment of deterrence strategies, it is useful to categorize them. For example, the various ways actors adopt cyber deterrence strategies can be categorized based on the threat they aim to dissuade and their types, means, and degrees of explicitness.\n## The Undesired Activity to Be Deterred\nActors can use cyber deterrence to deter threats not only in the cyber domain but also in other domains. In the former, the strategy of cyber deterrence can be used to deter different types of cyber threats that vary in intensity, complexity, and feasibility (e.g., Brantly 2016, 116–17; Burton 2018, 28–29). Brantly, for example, distinguishes three main categories of activities actors attempt to deter: cyberattacks, cyber espionage, and cyber theft (Brantly 2020, 8–9). Defending actors may also develop a cross-domain deterrence strategy to dissuade threats conducted through cyber space that target supply chains or critical infrastructures or that may affect military activities and effectiveness (Schneider 2019a, 103, 108–9).\nOther categories of employing cyber deterrence strategy concern the use of cyber means to dissuade attacks in kinetic domains (Lupovici 2016a, 325). For example, cyber means may bolster conventional deterrence (Schneider 2019a, 115–19, but see Libicki 2016, 281). In a similar way, cyber means may affect nuclear deterrence. Some scholars estimate that advances in artificial intelligence may undermine nuclear deterrence (Lieber and Press 2017, 10; Horowitz 2019, 782; Johnson 2020, 429–38). However, others who study developments in Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA), including the advancement of autonomous machines and computerized devices, point to how in some situations these systems may enhance deterrence vis-à-vis different kinds of kinetic attacks (Fortmann and Von Hlatky 2009, 309–12).\nA related question about the type of threat is the specific phase of the cyberattack defenders wish to deter. Brantly and Smeets (forthcoming, 4–5) distinguish among different stages of cyberattack, such as the penetration of the defender’s system to\n Some scholars indirectly refer to the adoption of the strategy while studying “deterrence success” as part of operationalizing deterrence threat. For example, in defining the issuing of an immediate extended deterrent threat, Huth and Russett argue that scholars need to focus on “observable behavioral indicators in the form of statements and military actions that signal the threat to use force if the protégé is attacked.” According to them, even if this is a bluff, it is part of practicing deterrence (Huth and Russett 1990, 488). However, their goal of operationalizing the issuing of the deterrent threat is to establish covariance as part of explaining deterrence success.\n This type of approach is clearly evident in Freedman and Michaels’ (2019) seminal book on the evolution of nuclear strategies in different periods of time and in different countries.\n In addition, scholars refer to more specific challenges, such as deterring the use of information warfare through cyber platforms (Whyte 2020b, 237–39).\nA Methodology for Cyber Deterrence Research\ninstall the means of attack and the execution of the attack to actually generate the damage.\n## Types of Deterrent Strategies\nActors differ in what specific type of deterrent strategies, or combination of them, they adopt. Currently, in addition to deterrence by punishment, scholars tend to emphasize the following types of cyber deterrence strategies: tailored deterrence (Kugler 2009), punctuated/cumulative deterrence (Kello 2017; Tor 2017, 205–11), deterrence by denial (Iasiello 2013; Libicki 2016, 268–70; Nye 2017, 56–7), deterrence by detection or by accusation (Lindsay and Gartzke 2018, 192; Finnemore and Hollis 2020, 980–81), and deterrence by naming and shaming and through development of international norms (Nye 2017, 60–62; Stevens 2012; see also Libicki 2009, 68).\n## The Deterrent Means\nNot only can actors adopt different types of cyber deterrence strategies, but they can also employ each strategy with different means. For example, deterrence by punishment may be based not only on the defender’s cyber means, but also on its economic, diplomatic, and kinetic means (e.g., Kugler 2009, 328; Jasper 2017, 95–96; Schneider 2019a). In a similar way, actors can employ deterrence by denial not only by communicating their defensive means, but also by communicating their means to avoid the damage, such as by establishing backup systems to ensure the resilience of the information infrastructures (see also Nye 2017, 57).\n## Degree of Explicitness\nWhether and how actors publicly declare they will respond to a challenge is fundamental to understanding these practices in any domain of conflict (Brantly 2016, 113). Given the fact that communicating threats is a core element of deterrence strategy, the degree of explicitness is a key characteristic of how cyber deterrence strategy is adopted and employed. Deterrent threats are communicated through a wide spectrum of expressions—ranging from full explicitness to lack of any reference to the deterrent threat—that contain three main elements:\nOne element is how the threat is articulated and directed at an opponent: for example, whether the threat is generally stated in a strategic document (e.g., Department of Defense 2011) or the defender targets specific opponents (e.g., Department of Defense 2018, 1).\nA second element is how explicitly the undesired activity the defender wants to prevent is communicated. Scholars have debated over this issue when studying deterrence in other domains, contemplating whether a red line should be clearly stated or not (e.g., Lockhart 1978, 548–51; Schelling 1981, 38–41).\nA third element is the extent to which the deterrent threat itself is communicated. Actors differ in how explicitly they present the consequences that will stem from the challenger’s undesired activity: whether, for example, the defender specifies the retaliatory punishment or only presents it generally. A number of US documents have stated that the United States preserves the right to retaliate against a cyberattack with all the means they hold (Department of Defense 2011, 2; Department of Defense 2013, 32, 41–42; see also in Healey 2019; and in Wilner 2020). While some argue that actors can achieve a deterrent effect by specifying what a retaliatory strike will include (to a specific challenger) (e.g., Kugler 2009, 331–32), others suggest that states often issue a more general threat, using ambiguity as a mechanism of deterrence (e.g., Brantly 2016, 114). Conversely, actors may refrain from explicitly\nAMIR LUPOVICI\n\nOther possibilities exist between full explicitness and non-explicitness in communicating deterrent threats. Kugler (2009, 311–3), for example, reviews key US documents since 2003 and concludes that while they acknowledge the need to develop cyber deterrence strategy, they do not elaborate on how it can be attained. Likewise, actors, such as in the Israeli case, may discuss the need to adopt a strategy of cyber deterrence or wish to develop such a strategy but refrain from directly and explicitly issuing deterrent threats. In the last decade, senior Israeli policymakers have made the point that Israel should acquire a cyber deterrence strategy. For example, when serving as minister of defense, Ehud Barak suggested that in the uncertainty that cyber capabilities create, “leadership is required to show the way as to how to do the right thing for Israel and to establish a deterrent balance” (Barak 2012). Prime Minister Netanyahu also explained the need to develop a cyber deterrence strategy despite the fact that “[t]he ability to deter is more difficult because the source of such an attack is more anonymous. This is a problem we will certainly have to address” (Netanyahu 2011).\nInterestingly, in May 2020, it seems that Israel has moved to adopt an even more explicit cyber deterrence strategy when its retaliation against targets in Iran in response to a cyberattack on water infrastructures in Israel was reported (Warrick and Nakashima 2020). The publication of the Israeli retaliation, as well as other statements made by Israeli officials such as by Minister of Defense, Naftali Bennett, were interpreted as an attempt of Israel to send deterrent messages to the Iranians and to draw a red line (Siman Tov and Even 2020).\nSending deterrent messages through acts of retaliation is closely related to the concepts of punctuated deterrence and cumulative deterrence, where the actual use of force aims to punish and deliver a threatening message over a long period of time (Kello 2017, 205–11; Tor 2017). Even before the incidents of May 2020, some experts interpreted Israel’s offensive cyber capabilities in this context, claiming they aim in part to deter potential challengers and “show potential attackers what Israel is able to do if it chooses to respond to an attack” (Cohen, Freilich and Siboni 2016, 313).\nSome degree of explicitness—and thus communication and signaling—is a crucial aspect of these practices. According to Kello (2017, 209), “Diplomatic and signaling procedures will be required to demonstrate to adversaries that for the purpose of punishment, individual hostile actions are regarded as a comprehensive package of offensive activity rather than being disparate actions that merit isolated responses.” Likewise, as Tor (2017, 107) asserts, just the use of force is insufficient in creating a cumulative cyber deterrent strategy, as there is also a need to “to outline the ‘rules of the game’ in a clear way.”\n## Advantages in Focusing on Adoption of Cyber Deterrence Strategy\nFocusing on the adoption and employment of cyber deterrence has a number of theoretical and methodological advantages: it diversifies research by highlighting an overlooked phenomenon, it invites plural approaches and methods that help to better explain and understand actors’ behavior, and it thus emphasizes\n In this respect, comparing US documents reveals a growing specification of cyber deterrence strategies over the years (e.g., in Kugler 2009, 311–13).\n Examples of less explicit messages that serve deterrent goals can be found in leaking of information around cyberattacks—such as Stuxnet, the corruption of Syria’s air defense system, the Chinese penetration of American health insurer files, and the Russian hack into the US Democratic Party files (Perkovich and Levite 2017, 273; see also Mazanec and Thayer 2014, 69).\nA Methodology for Cyber Deterrence Research\nthe importance of various strategic, normative, and cultural aspects related to this phenomenon. While to some extent these advantages could also be achieved by diverting the study around cyber deterrence failure/success to these directions, the main advantage lies in the observability that studying the adoption of the strategy allows. Not only does this advantage stand by its own in improving our understanding of the practices of cyber deterrence, but it also enhances the other advantages: diversification of the research and the use of plural methods.\n## Observability\nThe main advantage of studying the adoption and employment of deterrence strategy is the ability to trace empirical evidence of it. The idea behind a strategy of deterrence, as discussed above, is to issue and communicate threats. The communication can be more or less explicit—and can even be a bluff; however, it is a crucial part of practicing this strategy.\nEven if the deterrent threat is a bluff, the methodological solution based on studying the adoption and employment of (cyber) deterrent strategy cannot be dismissed based on an assertion that issuing deterrent threats is cheap talk. Given the cult of reputation and practitioners' worry about resolve (e.g., Tang 2005; Kertzer 2016), a defender may find it costly to not execute the deterrent threat or retaliate in case the undesired attack has been made by the putative challenger. They may fear that other actors will challenge them in the future because of the alleged demonstration of weakness. Actors thus are likely to take the adoption of cyber deterrence strategy and the issuing of deterrent threat seriously; issuing deterrent threats, therefore, provides indications of an actor's strategy.\nFocusing on observable indications allows scholars to address challenges in the study of cyber deterrence that stem from limited access to details around practicing cyber deterrence that in many cases remain unknown, such as the attack, the damage, and when the defender identified it was attacked. First, the problem of the dog that did not bark and the problem of the dog that should have barked become less pressing. Focusing on strategy adoption and the issuing of deterrent threat involves observing changes in the behavior of the defender actor. From this perspective, and as further discussed below, scholars can study nuances in strategy adoption, conduct comparisons among actors and over time, and explain this phenomenon regardless of the putative challenger's behavior or of the deterrence strategy outcomes. In other words, the research will not be biased toward studying specific cases of deterrence failure.\nStudying cyber deterrence strategy adoption also addresses challenges around the dog that did bark problem. By focusing mainly on the behavior of the defender actor, scholars have much less difficulty in interpretation, as the outcome to be examined and explained is less ambiguous. Indeed, scholars may debate over whether an actor actually adopted a cyber deterrence strategy, how it differs from its previous strategies, and about its specific elements. However, because adopting and employing a strategy of deterrence requires some degree of explicitness—unlike deterrence successes and even cyber deterrence failures—scholars also have much more access to empirical evidence to discuss and dispute.\n Likewise, as Libicki (2016, 227) and Tor (2017, 107) note actors may deliver their deterrent messages not only in public channels but also in secret ones. While for scholars the delivering of deterrent messages secretly poses difficulties of observing and studying the occurrences, actors have incentives to make some public manifestations of the deterrent threat they issue, even indirectly, in order to target larger audiences. In addition, the focus of the suggested methodology is on the strategy, and not necessarily on the communication of a specific threat to a certain opponent. For example, in theory, a cyber deterrence strategy may be adopted explicitly, but the explicit strategic document may also acknowledge that in some situations the communication of the deterrent threat will be delivered privately.\n For further discussion of costly signals, cheap talk, and deterrence, see Fearon (2002, 13–16), Lupton (2018, 64), but also see Danilovic (2002, 130–40).\nIn addition, studying cyber deterrence strategy adoption makes more effective use of the methodological solutions traditional deterrence scholars offer to the challenges of exploring this strategy. First, scholars have pointed in different ways to the need to selectively choose case studies, such as studying critical cases of deterrence failure, or studying enduring rivals. While the main solution this article offers is somewhat different—focusing on the adoption/employment of the strategy—in fact, these solutions complement each other: for example, exploring the adoption, changes, and abandoning of cyber deterrence strategies over time between enduring rivals.\nOther solutions have aimed to better establish the causal mechanism (of deterrence success). Because of the observability of both cyber deterrence adoption and the elements that may account for it, the solution of developing specific hypotheses about the defender, the challenger, and the situation is useful direction to take. Scholars can observe the characteristics of cyber deterrence strategy adoption (e.g. explicitness, timing, the type of the cyber deterrence, the means to establish it, and the kind of challenge it aims to dissuade). In a similar way, scholars can provide various factors affecting such adoption, including elements of perceptions, culture, and norms on the one hand, and the strategic utility of the strategy on the other. Likewise, as further discussed below, they may explore the social context in which the strategy is embedded.\nFocusing on the adoption of the strategy is closely related to another solution advised by traditional deterrence scholars—that is, to rely on primary sources. Strategy adoption, being observable, provides sources to empirically establish the study of cyber deterrence. However, focusing on adoption also opens up other types of sources. Strategic documents establish the employment of the strategy, such as the US Department of Defense Cyberspace Policy Report, Department of Defense Defense Science Board, and the Department of Defense Cyber Strategy. Other relevant sources help to understand and explain how actors adopt cyber deterrence strategy, in this way exploring the various elements presented above. For example, primary documents that trace how perceptions on cyber (domain) change over time and how the cyber (domain) is constructed (e.g. in Raymond 2019, 203--35) could provide an account of changes in actors' willingness to employ this strategy in the cyber domain.\nThe methodological solution I propose—focusing on the adoption and employment of the strategy rather on deterrence success—provides important indications of actors' perceptions of the strategy's effectiveness. Scholars can explore specific cases and conduct longitudinal and cross-sectional comparisons of actors who adopt (or refrain from adopting) cyber deterrence strategy. For example, a growing international tendency to rely on this strategy may imply increasing effectiveness of the strategy or at least an increase in the perception of its effectiveness. Indeed, there are different explanations as to why actors adopt and employ a strategy of (cyber) deterrence—and these should be explored. Nonetheless, given the limited access to information about deterrence success, solutions based on focusing on the strategy's adoption provide important alternatives.\nTechnological developments provide one explanation (or hypothesis) for the adoption of cyber deterrence strategy. For example, given the problem of attribution, technologies that help defenders trace the source of an attack may enhance this strategy's efficiency and hence its attractiveness. In a similar way, improvements in defensive measures, measures to increase resilience, and organization skills in operating these measures (Slayton 2017, 89--90, e.g. Matania and Tal-Shir 2020) may make strategies of deterrence by denial more attractive. While these are plausible hypotheses, we cannot reduce the adoption of (cyber) deterrence strategies to technological advancement. Other explanations could be developed, for example,\nA Methodology for Cyber Deterrence Research\nbased on actors' (strategic) culture (e.g., Knopf 2013, 9–10). A number of reviews of cyber security policies and strategies of different countries (e.g., Luijjf, Besseling, Spoelstra, and De Graaf 2013; Liveri and Sarri 2014; Baezner and Cordey 2019) provide not only the social context of cyber deterrence strategies, but also information to help explain their adoption (or lack thereof). The strategic, political, and cultural elements these reports review are useful points of departure toward that goal.\nInternational norms could also affect the adoption of cyber deterrence strategy. Nye, for example, suggests that deterrence through the establishment of international norms is one means of employing cyber deterrence. This strategy is based on creating taboos that increase the costs of attacking certain cyber targets (e.g., civilian cyber infrastructures) (Nye 20167, 60–62). From this perspective, the emergence of norms incentivizes actors to rely on practices of deterrence and adopt and employ them. Furthermore, the emergence of new norms can also affect other types of deterrence strategy, including deterrence by punishment. Actors may be more motivated to adopt such a strategy, for example, if cyberattacks are constructed as acts of violence. Seeing a challenge as “violent” increases an actor’s willingness to employ threats to dissuade it, thus enhancing deterrence effectiveness. The existence of a norm that portrays cyberattacks in this way legitimizes a retaliatory strike and thus the adoption of this strategy in the first place (Lupovici 2016a, 333–34). In recent years, scholars have begun to explore how public perceptions of cyber conflicts and dynamics affect support for retaliation against cyberattacks (Kreps and Schneider 2019; Shandler, Gross, and Canetti 2021). Public attitudes open up a broad area for research connecting normative, political, and institutional factors that also affect the adoption of cyber deterrence strategies.\n## Diversifying Cyber Deterrence Research\nBy focusing on the strategy’s adoption, we can examine and compare various kinds of actors, especially actors other than those commonly examined. In particular, the United States is overrepresented in the research. There are a number of reasons for this—including that many scholars are American and aim to influence the US strategy, that the United States is considered a cyber power, and the greater availability of American documents. Therefore, US cyber deterrence will probably continue to be closely examined.\nHowever, the observability of the adoption and employment of the strategy makes information on other cases also relatively accessible, which may help to fill the gap and advance our understanding of other countries. One of the research puzzles concerns actors who have not adopted an explicit cyber deterrence strategy—Israel being a key example. Despite the fact that deterrence is a strategy Israel has adopted vis-à-vis various threats (Lupovici 2016b), so far Israel has refrained from issuing direct cyber deterrent threats.\nDiversifying the research to include other states is also intriguing given the differing views on the strategy of deterrence and cyber security. Studying whether and how these actors adopt and employ cyber deterrence strategies helps to develop a more nuanced understanding of what cyber deterrence is and why and how it is used.\nWe can also extend the study of cyber deterrence to explore non-state actors. In recent years, deterrence scholarship has started to acknowledge other actors involved in the practices of deterrence (Paul, Morgan, and Wirtz 2009). Scholars have explored not only how states attempt to deter non-states threats (e.g., Wilner 2015, 37–74), but also how different kinds of non-state actors, such as terrorist\nI discuss below some more specific cultural explanations for adopting a strategy of deterrence.\nFor further discussion on the question of “violence,” use of force, cyberattacks, and legitimate retaliation, see Waxman (2011), Harrison Dinniss (2012, 63–75), Schmitt (2017, chapter 14, 16), and Schneider (2019a, 115).\nAMIR LUPOVICI\n\n## Inviting Plural Research Methods\nThe study of the adoption and employment of cyber deterrence strategies invites positivist and interpretative methods. Positivist scholars can study causal mechanisms of this phenomenon through quantitative and qualitative methods. Scholars can focus on specific case studies or conduct longitudinal and cross-sectional comparative works on actors who adopted, were late to adopt, or did not adopt cyber deterrence strategy.\nFocusing on adoption is a promising direction for examining whether, how, and why an actor adopts and employs a certain type of cyber deterrence strategy. One option is to explore the evolution of the strategy: for example, by tracing a shift in a state’s cyber strategy. The changes in 2018 in US cyber policy provide a useful demonstration of these dynamics, illustrating the advantages of the suggested framework. In 2018, the United States adopted a cyber strategy based on *defend forward* and *persistent engagement* (e.g., compare Department of Defense 2011 with Department of Defense 2018; see also Healey 2019; Kosseff 2019, 5; Wilner 2020, 266–67). While there is debate over how far this strategy diverts from an emphasis on deterrence, experts ascribe the shift to the limited applicability of deterrence strategy in the cyber domain (e.g., Fischerkeller and Harknett 2017; see also King and Gallagher 2020, 27–28).\nThis policy change led to some interesting questions. Foremost, the timing of this shift is worth exploring. Doubts over the effectiveness of cyber deterrence strategy were expressed as early as the 1990s. This implies that the 2018 change was informed by notions beyond those of the limitations of cyber deterrence strategy—for example, by the acknowledgment that adversaries in cyber space are in constant contact (e.g., Fischerkeller and Harknet 2017; Fischerkeller, Harknett, and Vičić 2020, 25–30). This shows that acceptance of new ideas and their successful promotion by individuals and networks may also be crucial in accounting for this change. Healey suggests that the change “stems directly from this Goldman–Fischerkeller–Harknett lineage (and subsequently drove the DoD Cyber Strategy and parts of the White House National Cyber Strategy). This is perhaps unsurprising “as all three are international relations scholars who have worked at US Cyber Command” (Healey 2019, 5). Processes of learning, persuasion, and individual characteristics can all help to explain whether and how cyber deterrence strategy is shifting, accepted, and employed.\nLearning may be also seen as a result of cyberattacks experienced by the United States, which led practitioners to emphasize the need to shift to persistent engagement. Whyte (2020a, 210–11) summarizes this point: “[N]umerous commentators . . . note the significance of Russian political warfare in 2016 as a realisation mo\n Likewise, Libicki concludes that the United States should not make cyber deterrence an explicit strategy and that it should not rely on it (Libicki 2016, 266).\n For similar dynamics regarding learning nuclear deterrence, see Kaplan (1991), Adler (1992), and Evangelista (1999). These studies show, in different ways, that although technological developments are crucial, they are insufficient to account for the adoption of deterrence strategies.\nA Methodology for Cyber Deterrence Research\nment prompting the development of the new, more assertive strategy.” Structural changes also allowed for and guided this shift. For example, comparing the 2018 cyber strategy with its predecessor (DoD 2015), Kollars and Schneider (2018) note “The 2018 Cyber Strategy reflects the changes in the political, technical, and institutional environment over the last three years.”\nAnother research direction that focuses on the adoption of the strategy could examine the exact nature, rather the efficiency, of the strategy: that is, examining whether and which type of deterrence strategy the new adopted policy aims to advance. Scholars have debated over whether the 2018 strategy emphasizes deterrence strategy (see, Healey 2019, 3–4). On the one hand, it was developed and justified based on the limits of cyber deterrence as discussed above. For example, Kreps and Schneider (2019, 9) assert that persistent engagement is better suited than deterrence. According to them, “[D]eterrence hinges on public resolve for overwhelming uses of force and a willingness to escalate, which appears lacking in the cyber domain, whereas persistent engagement can operate at a lower intensity of confrontation—albeit one that is relatively continuous—that gains legitimacy by virtue of the public support.”\nNonetheless, while experts acknowledge the shift in the US strategy, they also point to different types of deterrence strategy that the new policy emphasizes and to how it might actually enhance the US deterrent posture. For Whyte (2020a, 210), the new strategy marks a shift from deterrence by denial to a kind of deterrence by punishment. Likewise, Kollars and Schneider (2018) identify a specific shift in US strategy toward tailored deterrence against China and Russia, compared with a former comprehensive cyber deterrence strategy vis-à-vis a “wide array of actors and actions.” Furthermore, persistent engagement based on offensive action might strengthen deterrence strategy by signaling resolve and establishing escalation dominance (Kollars and Schneider 2018; Miller and Pollard 2019; Valeriano and Jensen 2019). In a similar way, the US Cyber Command Vision statement implements the idea of persistent engagement as a way to enhance the US deterrent posture. According to this document, “Through persistent action and competing more effectively below the level of armed conflict, we can influence the calculations of our adversaries, deter aggression, and clarify the distinction between acceptable and unacceptable behavior in cyberspace” (USCYBERCOM 2018, 6).\nThese discussions demonstrate not only the importance of looking into a cyber (deterrence) strategy, explaining it, and analyzing its components, but also the feasibility of conducting such research. Although, scholars can interpret the evidence differently, and the meaning and implications of the strategy may change over time, there is accessible and important evidence to work with. Furthermore, it helps to demonstrate how the suggested methodology provides an alternative to the challenges of studying deterrence success. While we still have little information about the outcomes of this strategy, we can start by considering the various aspects of its adoption.\nIn addition to focusing on one case study or on shifts in actors’ cyber deterrence strategy, such as the those discussed above (the case of Israel response in May 2020 and the 2018 US policy), scholars can also conduct broader comparisons. These can explore the reasons for the differences in how countries adopt and employ cyber deterrence strategies or compare an actor’s adoption and employment of cyber deterrence strategy with its adoption and employment of deterrence strategy\n The idea of persistent engagement sparked a debate over whether and to what extent cyber operations are effective in attaining strategic goals, and specifically whether and how they contribute to cyber deterrence success. While scholars acknowledged a number of advantages of the new policy, they were also worried that the criteria for success of this new strategy are not entirely clear; that employing it might be too costly; that it might lead to escalation; and that it may deteriorate US relationships with its allies (Healey 2019, 7–11; Lin and Smeets 2019; Miller and Pollard 2019; Smeets 2019a; Schneider 2019b; Smeets 2019b; Valeriano and Jensen 2019).\nAMIR LUPOVICI\n\nAn obvious advantage here is the access to comparable information and data. Scholars, thus, not only can conduct quantitative research that explores different aspects of the adoption of cyber deterrence strategies, but can also use data sets already available. This direction accords with Pytlak and Mitchell’s (2016, 79) recommendation to develop new techniques to address and use data in a way that overcomes the limited “amount of information publicly available.”\nBased on the data collected and analyzed by Brantly (2016), Valeriano, Jensen, and Maness (2018), and Kostyuk and Zhukov (2019), scholars are able to develop interesting notions about the adoption of deterrence strategy. For example, following these studies, it is possible to ask whether actors who absorbed significant cyberattacks tend to consider adopting cyber deterrence strategies to balance their insecurities, or whether more powerful actors tend to rely on this strategy, for example, based on long-term deterrence through previous execution of cyber means (i.e., cumulative cyber deterrence). These notions fit some of the assertions Valeriano et al. make, such as those about credibility and signaling (Valeriano, Jensen, and Maness 2018, 46–47), as well as about the long-term aims of cyber operations (Valeriano, Jensen, and Maness 2018, 11). Similarly, the cyber power score Brantly (2016, 138–40, 169) develops enables some hypotheses about the adoption of cyber deterrence strategies: for example, whether weaker states tend to adopt deterrence strategies to balance their inferiority (e.g., explicitly adopt the strategy) or to avoid it, fearing that adopting it will contribute to escalation. Based on these data, scholars can also compare whether and why different actors adopt different types of cyber deterrence strategies: for example, whether weaker actors rely on strategies such as deterrence by naming and shaming or deterrence by detection.\nThe suggested methodology based on studying the adoption of the strategy not only enables positivistic studies, but may also fit well with interpretative frameworks and research on deterrence. Interpretative scholars who study deterrence have started to employ discourse analysis to examine the practices of deterrence (Cohn 1987; Luke 1989; Dauber 1993; Harrington 2016; Vuori 2016). While these methods have not been fully applied to study cyber deterrence, this could be done through focusing on the adoption and employment of the strategy and on the language used. One specific promising direction is to study the adoption and employment of deterrence as securitizing moves (Lupovici 2019). Scholars have started to explore different securitizing moves related to cyber (Bendrath, Eriksson, and Giacomello 2007; Dunn Cavelty 2008; Hansen and Nissenbaum 2009; Deibert and Rohozinski 2010; Dunn Cavelty 2013; Stevens 2016). Looking into the adoption of cyber deterrence strategy provides intriguing cases to further apply the theory of securitization to traditional security challenges. This direction may cover various securitizing moves: for example, the American attempt to securitize cyber challenges to justify various means of retaliation, including even nuclear weapons, in the case of an “existential cyber attack” (Department of Defense 2013, 42; see also Wilner 2020, 261).\nIn a similar way, interpretative approaches highlight the importance of the social context in which deterrence strategy is embedded. These notions can be also ap-\n One goal of comparing cyber deterrence with deterrence in other domains is to validate the assertion that the adoption of cyber deterrence may indicate, even indirectly, deterrence success, as discussed above.\n Likewise, reports that document cyber incidents may also prove useful in tracing previous cyber operations and their influence on actors’ adoption of cyber deterrence strategies; see, for example, the project of the Council on Foreign Relations at https://www.cfr.org/cyber-operations.\nA Methodology for Cyber Deterrence Research\nplied to study cyber deterrence: for example, in examining how the strategy's adoption and employment are shaped by international norms, (strategic) culture, and actors' identity. This is important to better understand how and why actors adopt cyber deterrence strategies, but also because the way the strategy is adopted indicates and reflects political, normative, and cultural elements. Although scholars have not used these elements to study cyber deterrence adoption (but see Adamsky 2018), they have explained deterrence strategy adoption and employment in other domains by pointing to strategic culture (Basrur 2006, 49–79; Adamsky 2017, 166–71), norms (Tannenwald 2007, 45, 291–92), practices (Adler and Pouliot 2011, 9–15, 21–28), rituals (Mälksoo 2021), and actors' identity, emotions, and ontological security (Tannenwald 2007, 45–46; Lupovici 2016b). The adoption and employment of cyber deterrence strategy provide another arena to examine and employ these theories.\n# Conclusions\nThis article suggests that focusing on the adoption and employment of cyber deterrence strategy—rather than studying cyber deterrence success—promises to provide solutions to the methodological challenges associated with the study of this strategy. This article does not claim to advance the only way to explore cyber deterrence. On the contrary, scholars may well find methodological alternatives, as there is still need to collect and analyze data and case studies on deterrence failure/success. Nonetheless, based on clarifying methodological challenges and by offering a categorization of different characteristics of how (cyber) deterrence strategies are adopted, I point to a phenomenon that has received insufficient attention, and studying it carries a number of advantages. Among other things, it provides methodological solutions, it helps diversify the research of deterrence, and it invites plural approaches and methods. This paper thus should be seen as a point of departure for further research and as a call to focus on the adoption and employment of the strategy.\nMore generally, I suggest that elaborating on these issues contributes not only to the study of cyber deterrence, but also to the two fields of research: deterrence and cyber. For the former, the advantage lies in reframing methodological problems and challenges that may be relevant for scholars who explore not only cyber deterrence. Another advantage for deterrence research, in general, lies in studying an understudied phenomenon. More scholarly work has been done on the adoption and employment of deterrence strategies (mainly of nuclear deterrence, e.g., Kaplan 1991; Adler 1992; Evangelista 1999; Freedman and Michaels 2019) than on the adoption of cyber deterrence strategies. Nonetheless, while the study of deterrence strategy adoption lags behind the study of deterrence success, it may well complement it. From this perspective, this article provides a first step in developing a methodology to study the adoption and employment of different types of deterrence strategies in different domains and with different deterrent means.\nThis is, furthermore, an important phenomenon on its own. It may indicate various aspects about actors' strategic thinking, perceptions, culture, and identity. Understanding how, when, and why actors adopt and employ deterrence strategies (or change or abandon them) in various domains may also further the study of cyber deterrence adoption and employment. The study of more traditional strategies of deterrence may reveal additional explanations and possible characteristics to examine, explain, and compare. Conversely, studying the adoption of cyber deterrence may advance the study of more traditional strategies of deterrence. Most notably, studying cyber deterrence emphasizes that adoption of deterrence strategies cannot be taken as given but requires explanation. It also reveals our assumptions in studying deterrence. For example, traditional studies of deterrence take as given that the challenge is an act of violence or that the timing of the attack and the tim\nAMIR LUPOVICI\n\nRegarding cyber studies, exploring the strategy's adoption may account for changes in actors' behavior. In other words, studying cyber deterrence adoption demonstrates how technological and normative changes affect cyber strategies. In a similar way, we can study how culture, on the one hand, and rational calculations, on the other hand, affect behavior in the cyber domain. Studying cyber deterrence adoption makes cyber behavior more observable. Therefore, we can draw implications from it that go beyond those related solely to deterrence.\n## Acknowledgments\nI would like to thank Patricia Greve, Gallia Lindenstrauss, and the three anonymous reviewers for their extremely helpful comments and suggestions on different drafts of this manuscript.

Studying cyber deterrence presents even greater challenges, as traditional deterrence challenges are exacerbated and interactions in the cyber domain create further difficulties. When studying cyber deterrence, scholars face uncertainty not only in identifying situations of deterrence success, but also—due to the secrecy surrounding cyber practices—in identifying situations of deterrence failure. Despite the many studies on cyber deterrence, methodological solutions to address these challenges still need to be developed. To this end, I suggest focusing on the adoption and employment of the strategy rather than on its success. I argue that since communicating threats is a core element of deterrence, it is easier to observe how the strategy is adopted and employed than whether it succeeds or fails. This focus provides a promising direction to study cyber deterrence and address these challenges.\nEl estudio de disuasión presenta una serie de desafíos, principalmente relacionados con la identificación de casos de éxito de disuasión y la definición de su funcionamiento. El estudio de la ciberdisuasión presenta desafíos aún mayores, ya que los desafíos tradicionales de la disuasión se ven exacerbados y las interacciones en el ámbito cibernético generan más dificultades. Al estudiar la ciberdisuasión, los académicos se enfrentan a la incertidumbre no solo a la hora de identificar situaciones de éxito de disuasión, sino también a la hora de identificar situaciones de fracaso de disuasión debido a la confidencialidad que gira en torno a las prácticas cibernéticas. A pesar de los numerosos estudios sobre la ciberdisuasión, todavía es necesario desarrollar soluciones metodológicas para abordar estos desafíos. Para lograrlo, sugiero enfocarse en la adopción e implementación de la estrategia más que en su éxito. Sostengo que, dado que comunicar amenazas es un elemento clave de la disuasión, es más fácil observar cómo se adopta e implementa la estrategia que identificar si tiene éxito o fracasa. Este enfoque marca un rumbo prometedor para estudiar la ciberdisuasión y abordar estos desafíos.\nL'étude de la dissuasion présente un certain nombre de défis qui sont principalement liés à l'identification de la réussite de la dissuasion et à la définition de la manière dont la dissuasion fonctionne.

While scholars have pointed to the challenges of practicing cyber deterrence, their focus—like that of most deterrence scholars—has been on deterrence success. Most studies assess whether and how deterrence by punishment can be applied to the cyber domain (e.g., in Wilner 2020, 252–54), or whether and how it should be replaced with other strategies or types of deterrence, such as deterrence by denial (Iasiello 2013), or by cumulative deterrence (Tor 2017). These studies are part of the tendency Stevens (2016, 24) observes of cyber security studies to be “commonly oriented towards policy concerns.” Nonetheless, less attention is given to methodological challenges around studying cyber deterrence. This article aims to advance the methodology of studying (cyber) deterrence by offering a categorization of the methodological challenges concerning studying deterrence and by offering an alternative way to explore this strategy.\nInspired by the dog that did not bark problem—a bias in the study of deterrence toward cases of deterrence failure (Sauer 2016, 49)—I categorize three clusters of problems regarding the study of deterrence. Besides the dog that did not bark problem, I group additional challenges into two clusters of problems that I term the dog that did bark and the dog that should have barked problems. The former refers to challenges around interpreting cases of deterrence success and failure, and the latter to a bias that stems from the difficulty of identifying attacks and therefore seeing them as deterrence failures.\nBased on this categorization, I review and illustrate the challenges in studying cyber deterrence and the limited applicability of the current solutions offered to address them. These challenges include identifying deterrence success, selecting appropriate cases, and establishing causal connections between issuing the deterrent threat and deterrence success. While these problems generally characterize the study of deterrence, they are exacerbated in studying cyber deterrence, mainly because we cannot observe cyber deterrence successes and failures.\nI claim that one way to solve the challenges in studying cyber deterrence strategy is to shift focus from deterrence success to its adoption and employment. While this is\nStudying the adoption of cyber deterrence strategies overlaps with broader attempts to explore the motivation behind cyber strategies (e.g., Valeriano, Jensen, and Maness 2018; Gomez 2021).\nA Methodology for Cyber Deterrence Research\nnot the only solution—and indeed scholars still need to study deterrence success—I assert it provides a useful point of departure for thinking about and exploring this strategy.\nA number of scholars have begun to study the adoption of cyber deterrence strategies with illuminating insights (Kugler 2009, 311–13; Stevens 2012; Adamsky 2018; Healey 2019; Gold 2020, 8–21; Wilner 2020). While I rely on this scholarship, I also aim to advance it. The main goal for most of these works is to describe the evolution of the strategy rather than to explain the phenomenon of adopting the strategy. I suggest that using the adoption and employment of the strategy as the explained phenomenon (i.e., *explanandum*) is a promising method because of the observability of these aspects of the strategy. Communicating threats is a core element of a deterrence strategy, which makes the strategy’s adoption and employment much more explicit than its success or failure. This allows me to offer a categorization of how actors diverge in adopting and applying deterrence strategies, based on the goal, type, means, and explicitness of the strategy. This in turn provides a useful framework to study deterrence, and especially cyber deterrence strategies. Furthermore, as I demonstrate below, the study of the adoption and employment of cyber deterrence strategies encourages methodological pluralism, open to both positivist and interpretative methods.\nThe article proceeds as follows: In the first section, I discuss the main problems in the study of deterrence and the main solutions scholars offer to address them. In the second part, I specify the increased pressure of these challenges when studying cyber deterrence and argue that most solutions are not sufficient to remedy the problems. The third section develops a methodology for studying cyber deterrence, based on different characteristics that concern the adoption of the strategy. The fourth section shows and illustrates the promise of focusing on the adoption and employment of cyber deterrence to address the challenges. Such focus provides new research questions, explanations, and hypotheses, and diversifies the research of this strategy. I conclude by discussing the implications of this study on deterrence research in general and on cyber security research.\n## Methodological Challenges in Studying Deterrence\nScholars studying deterrence have paid a great deal of attention to methodological issues. While it is beyond this paper’s scope to discuss all the methodological challenges in the study of deterrence, I group the main challenges into three clusters. The first is based on what scholars refer to as the dog that did not bark problem. Building on this, I introduce two further problems: the dog that did bark and the dog that should have barked (see table 1).\n## The Dog That Did Not Bark\nThe dog that did not bark problem revolves around selection bias in studying cases of deterrence failure. Scholars are referring to Sherlock Holmes’ ability to solve a murder mystery based on the fact that a dog, present at the night of the murder, did not bark. Key to solving the case is the idea that there is meaning in the fact that something did not happen. The dog did not bark because the dog knew the perpetrator (see also Sauer 2016, 49). Based on this analogy, scholars have pointed to the flawed tendency to focus only on cases of deterrence failure, which provide\nFor reviews and comparisons of cyber strategies of different countries, see Thomas (2009), Lewis and Neuneck (2013), Luiijf, Besseling, Spoelstra, and De Graaf (2013), Liveri and Sarri (2014), and Baezner and Cordey (2019). See also King and Gallagher (2020, 144–45).\nThe debates over how to study deterrence, advanced not only research on deterrence and security, but also, and more broadly, studies in international relations (IR) and political science (e.g., see in King, Keohane, and Verba 1994, 24,134–35).\nAMIR LUPOVICI\n\nTable 1. Clusters of methodological challenges in the study of deterrence and cyber deterrence\n|  The problem | Description | Implications for the study of deterrence | Implications for the study of cyber deterrence  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  The dog that did not bark | The fact that the dog did not bark during a murder means something. In other words, it is important to analyze events that did not happen. | Scholars need to study not only cases of deterrence failure, but also cases of deterrence success (where allegedly nothing happens). However, the research suffers from a selection bias. Given the difficulties of studying cases of deterrence success, scholars tend to focus on studying cases of deterrence failure. | The selection bias is more challenging. Given the secrecy that surrounds interactions in the cyber domain, identifying cases of deterrence success is much more difficult, which further biases the study toward studying cases of deterrence failure.  |\n|  The dog that did bark | Interpreting events is very difficult. Dog’s barking does not necessarily mean that there was a murder, and vice versa (if the dog did not bark it does not mean that there was no murder). | Not only is the line between deterrence failure and success not clear-cut, but interpreting whether deterrence succeeded or failed based on the level of violence is problematic. Eruption of violence is not proof of deterrence failure, as lack of violence is not proof of deterrence success. | Interpreting events and concluding deterrence failure and success from observations is even more challenging given the secrecy surrounding cyber incidents and the ambiguity concerning what should be considered as violent attack (which constitute deterrence failure). Therefore, scholars face difficulties in classifying cases and in establishing (causal) explanations.  |\n|  The dog that should have barked | When the dog is not fully aware of the presence of a suspicious person, and therefore is not barking (e.g., in case of a murder, the dog is failing to notice or is noticing too late). | This challenge poses another sort of case selection bias, as obviously scholars are only able to study the cases they are aware of. | Scholars are not only biased toward studying cases of deterrence failure as indicated by the traditional challenge of studying deterrence. In cases of cyber deterrence, scholars are also not fully aware of cases of deterrence failure. This biases the research in different ways, including scholars’ tendency to focus on a limited number of known case studies of cyber deterrence failure for which relatively more information is available.  |\nA Methodology for Cyber Deterrence Research\nconsiderable observable traces to follow—the employment of violence by at least one of the parties (Achen and Snidal 1989, 161; Lebow and Stein 1990, 336, 347; King, Keohane, and Verba 1994, 24). Positivist scholars use this analogy to challenge scholars' ability to provide a full coloration given that they focus on one possible value of the examined variable of deterrence success—that is, deterrence failure. Some scholars have even suggested the problem is deeper, since focusing on deterrence failures leads to exploration of much more resolute actors—those “who select themselves into crises” and therefore are less likely to be deterred (Danilovic 2002, 117–19; Fearon 2002, 6, 14; see also Wilner 2015, 190, footnote 4, p. 241).\nWhile the problematic tendency to focus on cases of deterrence failure clearly exists, it should be noted that lack of violence is not a nonoccurrence. As Tannenwald, emphasizes, \"[T]here is no such thing as explaining a non-event . . . What is actually being explained is a contrast between an actual event and a possible alternative counterfactual event.\" What we are in fact asking is not why the dog did not bark, but why the dog was silent, as we have a reasonable expectation that in such situations the counterfactual (e.g., barking) is a likely scenario (Tannenwald 2007, 30). From this perspective, when deterrence succeeds (and there is no violence) something does happen: policymakers decide that the cost of violence is too high for them to pursue the act the defender aims to prevent. Put differently, it is not that nothing happened, but rather that we cannot easily see it.\n## The Dog That Did Bark\nI use the phrase the dog that did bark to refer to difficulties around interpreting observations. We cannot deduce an occurrence from an event that correlates with another event. Usually dogs bark when they notice a suspicious person (e.g., a potential murderer); however, of course, we cannot deduce, just because a dog barked that a murder has taken place. Similarly, in the absence of suspicious activity, dogs do not bark. But the fact a dog did not bark does not mean no crime occurred. This analogy allows us to group a number of challenges around determining deterrence failure and success and their implications.\nNotably, the eruption of violence does not necessarily indicate deterrence failure. First, deterrence success is not a binary variable. For example, some scholars argue that, unlike nuclear deterrence, in cases of low(er) levels of violence, decreasing the amount of violence can be considered deterrence success even if it does not totally prevent the violence (Rid 2012; Wenger and Wilner 2012, 318). Second, paradoxically, in some cases, deterrence success increases the level of violence, as an opponent can execute a challenge to provoke retaliation in order to attain political gain.\nNonetheless, not only can we not deduce deterrence failure from violence, but, and more importantly, we cannot deduce deterrence success from observing lack of violence. For example, there may be no challenger. As Morgan (2003, 121) argues, if a state \"has no intention of attacking the case cannot tell us whether deterrence works and how.\" In addition, even if the challenger has motivation to attack the defender, it may refrain for reasons other than the deterrent posture of the defender.\n\nAMIR LUPOVICI\n\n## The Dog That Should Have Barked\nWhile the two challenges presented above—the dog that did not bark and the dog that did bark—group and refer to known problems and biases in the study of deterrence, the dog that should have barked emphasizes a less-studied challenge. This problem stems from the expectation that the dog needs to bark if something suspicious is happening. As noted above, the counterfactual is that if the dog did not bark, it means something. However, inspired by this analogy we can also create a third cluster: a situation where the dog did not bark, but should have. While this can be seen as a subcategory of the dog that did not bark problem, the counterfactual here is different. Unlike the original, in which the dog had no reason to bark, in this situation, if the dog were aware of the occurrence, then it would definitely be barking. Nonetheless, the dog that should have barked problem also differs from the dog that did bark problem. The dog that did bark points to a situation in which the occurrence is known but its meaning is not. In the dog that should have barked, not only is the interpretation unclear, but what happened remains a mystery.\nFor the purpose of the study of deterrence, this analogy emphasizes situations in which practitioners are unaware of what happened, or at least of situations that have no public record.7 This means that scholars are limited in using these cases. Not only are they unaware of cases of deterrence success (as evident in the dog that did not bark problem), but they may also be unaware of cases of deterrence failure.\n## Current Solutions in Scholarship\nThe dog that did not bark and what I term the dog that did bark point to three main challenges in the study of deterrence: (1) bias in case selection; (2) difficulty of determining deterrence success and deterrence failure, and thus of classifying case studies; and (3) problems in establishing causality, that is, in showing that there is not only a correlation between the issuing of the threats and the avoidance of violence, but that the deterrent threat causes it (George and Smoke 1974, 90–93; Luke 1989, 214; Lebow and Stein 1990, 345; Freedman 2004, 13). Scholars offer a number of solutions to these challenges.\nFirst, scholars urge careful selection of case studies. Among other things, they recommend exploring critical case studies of deterrence failure (Lebow and Stein 1989, 221–22). In addition, Huth and Russett suggest focusing on immediate deterrence rather than on cases of general deterrence. Immediate deterrence is characterized by explicit threats or the movement of alerting military forces, and thus it provides the observer with “reasonable assessment of whether deterrence succeeded or failed” (Huth and Russett 1988, 30). Also, they suggest examining cases of both deterrence failure and deterrence success (Huth and Russett 1990,\ninvolvement in Syria since 2012 and especially since 2013, and the pressure from Iran not to waste resources (Lupovici 2016b, 183).\n7These situations usually result from what Baliga, Bueno De Mesquita, and Wolitzky (2020, 1055) refer to as detection failure, where defenders are unaware that an attack occurred.\nA Methodology for Cyber Deterrence Research\n468–73). However, as Jervis asserts, this solution is limited, as the important question is why deterrence fails and not the frequency of deterrence failures (Jervis 1989, 194).\nSecond, scholars suggest examining the long-term dynamics of enduring rivals to address a number of challenges in the study of deterrence (Stein 1996; Lieberman 2013; Danilovic and Clare 2017, 14–15). This enables the exploration not only of immediate deterrence, but also of general deterrence. Morgan (2003, 82) suggests that focusing only on crises is problematic since it prevents studying the inter-crises periods, which are crucial because actors often attempt to employ general deterrence strategy. Focusing on enduring rivals also addresses the bias in studying mainly cases of deterrence failure. It helps to establish the causal connections by addressing questions around whether the challenger seriously considered war or, if the challenger backed down, whether it was affected by the defender’s deterrent strategy. In addition, it helps to establish a more focused comparison because the same actors are examined over time. Finally, studying enduring rivals also addresses the challenge of identifying the defender and the challenger, by revealing shifts in actors’ balance of interests (Lieberman 2013, 29–32; see also Stein 1996).\nThird, scholars suggest dealing with the challenge of identifying deterrence success by developing hypotheses about the defender, the challenger, and the conflict (Stern, Axelrod, Jervis, and Rander 1989, 6, 19–21, 33). While this solution complements some other solutions, it leads in practice to debates around results without necessarily providing convincing explanations. A prime example of these limitations is the study of whether the actual use of force contributes to enhancing a deterrent posture and demonstrating resolve (Schelling 1966, 116–25; Mercer 1996; Press 2005; Tang 2005; Rid 2012, 128; Lupton 2018, 61–66). This issue is highly debated, and scholars suggest the empirical findings on it are inconclusive and that further research is needed (Huth 1997; Sartori 2005, 9; Weisiger and Yarhi-Milo 2015, 479).\nFourth, scholars have advised relying on primary sources and detailed historical accounts to better determine the defender and challenger and to better establish deterrence success (or failure). This will also decrease selection bias in the study of deterrence (Lebow and Stein 1990, 346–51). Following these ideas, Wilner (2011, 32–33), for example, suggests that primary sources are crucial to establishing the putative challenger’s intentions and how they change. While use of primary sources is promising, a common problem is the difficulty of accessing the kind of evidence needed. Leaders’ statements may not be sincere, especially around the effect of the deterrent threat on behavior. As Morgan asserts, the challenger “won’t announce that it backed down because it was scared: instead, it never planned to attack” (Morgan 2003, 122; see also Huth and Russett 1990, 491). Even in private discussions, policymakers tend not to admit the effect of the opponent’s deterrence strategy (Lebow and Stein 1989, 222). The sources that help address this challenge come from closed meetings, classified policy analyses, and military orders and assessments, all of which are hard to trace (Huth and Russett 1990, 491). However, they do provide much stronger evidence of whether and how deterrent threat shapes a putative challenger’s behavior.\n## Challenges in Studying Cyber Deterrence\nThe challenges around studying conventional and nuclear deterrence are much more pressing in the context of cyber deterrence. Not only do interactions in the\n\nAMIR LUPOVICI\n\n## Cyber Deterrence Research\nMost scholars acknowledge that cyber deterrence involves the use of threats to prevent cyberattacks or attacks on defender’s information systems (Stevens 2012, 149–52; Lupovici 2016a, 324–25). Many agree that successfully employing cyber deterrence strategy is difficult (in Morgan 2010; Stevens 2012, 149–53). Among other things, they argue that defending actors cannot easily pose a credible threat because of the difficulty of identifying the challenger, the large number of potential challengers, the asymmetry between the challengers and the defenders, the low entry costs, the limited public support to retaliate against cyberattacks, and the defenders’ difficulty exposing their capabilities (Harknett 1996; Molander, Riddle, and Wilson 1996, 87; Cordesman and Cordesman 2001, 7; Arquilla 2003, 210–13; Libicki 2007, 271–72; Libicki 2009, 1–3, 26, 44–45; Morgan 2010, 55–76; Geers 2011, 111–22; Fischerkeller and Harknett 2017, 386–87; Kreps and Schneider 2019; Fischerkeller, Harknett, and Vičić 2020, 25–30).\nIndeed, some scholars suggest various methods to enhance the effectiveness of deterrence strategy in dissuading cyberattacks. Recently, scholars have become more optimistic about achieving this goal. For example, scholars offer innovative ways to think about the implications of the attribution problem and how deterrence can work under imperfect attribution (Glaser 2011, 3; Baliga, Bueno De Mesquita, and Wolitzky 2020). Scholars also suggest that the attribution problem can be addressed in various, mainly technical and technological, ways (e.g., Rid and Buchanan 2014; Egloff and Dunn Cavelty 2021) and therefore should not necessarily prevent the execution of retaliation. Furthermore, the attribution problem is not a challenge for deterrence theory per se, but is shaped through social norms that might be changed over time (Lupovici 2016a).\nScholars suggest that, in addition to deterrence by punishment, actors also rely on tailored deterrence; serial and cumulative deterrence; deterrence by denial; deterrence by naming and shaming; deterrence through the development of international norms; and deterrence by detection. Scholars also note that actors could deter by punishment through the threat of using kinetic means, and not just through cyber means (Wheatley and Hayes 1996, 13, 19–20; Cordesman and Cordesman 2001, 7; Kugler 2009; Morgan 2010, 59, 68; Glaser 2011, 4; Stevens 2012; Tor 2017; Nye 2017; Lindsay and Gartzke 2018, 192; Schneider 2019a, 109; Wilner 2020, 253). They have also suggested that cyber deterrence is more likely to be effective against a potential cyberattack that is equivalent to armed conflict. This is because in such situations, the impact of the unique characteristics of cyberspace on deterrence will be less pronounced (Fischerkeller, Harknett, and Vičić 2020, 29).\nWhile debates continue, these scholars emphasize the theoretical questions—whether and when cyber deterrence may work—and offer policy implications. Nonetheless, less attention is given to methodological questions and challenges around studying these issues, and to how evidence should be collected and analyzed.\n For a review of this scholarship, see Nye (2017); Mandel (2017, 43–64); Wilner (2020, 251–56).\n Cooper (2012, 111–18) suggests the concept of *network deterrence*. He argues that the combination of means such as punishment, futility, and dependency could strengthen deterrence effectiveness when defenders and putative challengers share a network.\nA Methodology for Cyber Deterrence Research\n## The Impact of Problems in Studying Deterrence on the Research on Cyber Deterrence\n### The Dog That Did Not Bark\nLike other studies of deterrence, cyber deterrence scholarship is biased toward focusing on cases of deterrence failure. In fact, the limited access to data and the limited evidence available to scholars result in greater research bias. This is not necessarily a problem for specific studies that focus on a small number of prominent case studies. However, it is a challenge to the scholarship as a whole. As Valeriano and Maness observe, “[c]omparative case studies are rare, given the tendency to focus on events that might be outliers,” such as Estonia (2007), Stuxnet (2010), and Sony Hack (2014), leaving aside typical cyber interactions (Valeriano and Maness 2018, 260). These overlooked interactions may include cases of deterrence success.\nThe research, then, not only tends to examine cases of deterrence failure, but also focuses on a limited number of cases. Methodologically, it is not clear to what extent these cases represent the general “population” of cases of cyber deterrence. For example, the reason that led to the availability of the case for deterrence scholars may also have affected the deterrence outcome. Given the secrecy that surrounds many cyberattack incidents, known cases of deterrence failures may indicate situations in which resolute actors chose to challenge.\n### The Dog That Did Bark\nThis problem concerns how scholars interpret observations: the challenge of establishing whether a certain case is a deterrence failure or success and thus of establishing the causal mechanism of deterrence failure/success. The secrecy around cyber incidents and the limited information available to scholars exacerbate the challenges in deterrence research (see also Burton 2018, 6; Healey and Jenkins 2019, 125). These challenges include actors’ tendency to see themselves as the defender (and not the challenger) and the difficulty of developing a more nuanced classification of deterrence success/failure: one that is not dichotomic but acknowledges that deterrence failure and deterrence success are on a continuum. In a similar way, a significant challenge is to determine what constitutes deterrence failure. While in the kinetic domains, scholars, practitioners, and law experts have over many years developed an understanding of this, it is still debated in the cyber domain (e.g., Schmitt 2017). This further complicates the academic community’s ability to interpret deterrence failure and success, and to classify cases.\nThe challenge of identifying relevant cases not only creates selection bias, but also complicates the ability to determine the impact of the deterrent threat on the putative challenger’s behavior. This difficulty is shaped by the combination of the limitation of available information on cyberattacks and the characteristics of cyberattacks, which make the temporality of the attack a key issue. In kinetic domains, the timing of the attack and of the damage is similar; and in most cases, damage follows shortly after the attack’s execution. For example, it takes a few minutes for an intercontinental missile to hit its target, and damage will follow and start impacting the defender usually less than an hour after the initiation of the attack. Because of the various modes and stages of executing cyberattacks, on the other hand, scholars have to distinguish between the timing of the attack and the timing of the damage (e.g., Brantly and Smeets forthcoming, 4–5). Challengers can better control the timing of the attack. They can predetermine the attack or use the original attack as a platform for future attacks. This increased difficulty in identifying the deterrent threat’s timing and its influence on the putative challenger’s behavior makes study of it much more onerous. Furthermore, it raises a crucial question about the meaning of deterrence success: that is, whether executing an attack can be considered deterrence failure if the damage has yet to occur. All of this inhibits our ability to interpret deterrence success or to classify cases of deterrence failure and success.\nAMIR LUPOVICI\n\nUnlike the previous two clusters of challenges, this problem mainly affects the study of cyber deterrence. While the dog that did not bark emphasizes the problems stemming from being unable to observe cases of deterrence success, this problem emphasizes problems stemming from being unable to clearly observe cases of deterrence failure.\nIn other domains, the execution of an attack leaves traces and evidence that scholars can use. These traces help scholars to determine the case as deterrence failure, as well as to examine aspects related to the execution of the challenge: for example, the damage, how it was done, and by whom. In contrast, cyberattacks usually leave fewer traces. In fact, even a significant cyberattack may not be easily traced. For example, a cyberattack may target the electricity grid but be masked as an accident or a failure of the system (see also Schneider 2019a, 114). Furthermore, in some cases, the effectiveness of cyberattacks requires that they will remain untraced. In the well-known case of Stuxnet, the worm aimed not only to damage Iranian centrifuges, but also to confuse the Iranian scientists regarding the sources of the problem (Farwell and Rohozinski 2012, 115).\nWhile the research on cyber deterrence focuses on the problem of attribution—a situation in which the source of an attack is unknown—a key difficulty concerns a more fundamental challenge: the ability to detect that there was an attack in the first place. Brantly, for example, notes that in the cyber domain it is more important “to identify that an attack is occurring . . . than to in the moment identify who is actually conducting the attack” (Brantly 2016, 87). Moreover, regardless of whether or not the victim is aware of the attack, it is a challenge for scholars, who often have limited access to such information. For this reason, some scholars state their main focus is to study compelling success rather than deterrence success. Valeriano, Jensen, and Maness (2018, 24) suggest that “[o]ur choice to focus on compelling is driven by the need to examine the efficacy of operations that seek to achieve demonstrable effects. Compreciency is about changing behavior, while deterrence is about preventing behaviors, the latter being difficult to observe empirically.”\n# The Limitations of Current Solutions\nThe solutions put forward to address challenges in studying deterrence have advanced deterrence research, but they have encountered some difficulties. Applying them to cyber deterrence studies, that focus on exploring deterrence success/failure, creates additional problems, given the unique characteristics of cyber deterrence and how knowledge around cyber incidents and cyber deterrence is produced. While common solutions may become more effective in the future, as technology changes and reliable information on cyber incidents increases, they are currently quite limited.\nOne direction for a solution is to acquire data and conduct quantitative studies based on it. While a few scholars have started to use these methods to examine cyber deterrence success or closely related behavior with interesting findings (e.g., Brantly 2016; Pytlak and Mitchell 2016),[12] they have also pointed to challenges in using data to this end (e.g., Valeriano, Jensen, and Maness 2018, 24). Others also indicate the need to develop new ways to use data given the challenges of studying this strategy (Pytlak and Mitchell 2016, 79).\nBecause of the challenges of studying cyber deterrence, it is difficult to employ the solutions discussed above based on careful selection of specific case studies—that is, focusing on critical case studies and immediate deterrence and exploring\n[12] For example, Brantly’s (2016, 143–49) findings support the assertions that actors’ ability to maintain anonymity enhances the chances for deterrence failure. Nonetheless, Pytlak and Mitchell are unable to establish significant correlation and in the end reach inconclusive interpretations of the evidence (Pytlak and Mitchell 2016, 73–79).\nA Methodology for Cyber Deterrence Research\ncases of deterrence failure as well as of deterrence success. These solutions cannot fully resolve the challenges of determining cyber incidents and identifying and classifying situations of cyber deterrence failure and success. Jervis (1989, 194) has warned that explaining deterrence failure and success is more important than explaining their frequency; this caution is even more important in studying cyber deterrence given that the cases scholars are able to examine are more biased. The challenges of case selection stem not only from the dog that did not bark problem, but also from the dog that did bark and the dog that should have barked problems—biasing cases both of deterrence success and of deterrence failure.\nLikewise, focusing on cases of immediate deterrence also becomes a challenge when studying cyber deterrence, mainly because of the lack of available information and the characteristics of cyberattacks themselves. Scholars must distinguish the time of the attack, the time of its damage, the time the defender acknowledges the attack (and the damage), and the time the attack becomes public knowledge. The defender itself may be unaware that it needs to employ an immediate deterrence threat. For example, in contrast to other domains, preparations for attacks in the cyber domain leave less traces compared to preparations of kinetic attacks and thus complicate the ability of deterrer actors to pose an immediate deterrent threat. This means that examining cases of immediate deterrence is of limited help in studying cyber deterrence: actors have fewer opportunities to perform this strategy, the existence of known cases of immediate cyber deterrence may be biased, and, most importantly, scholars may not have access to full information on these cases.\nSolutions put forward to better establish the causal connection between the deterrent threat and the challenger behavior face similar challenges. Along with the problems discussed (case selection and identification of deterrence failure and success, which also limit establishing the \"explanation\") is the limited available information on the case studies. This makes additional potential solutions impractical, such as the relying on primary sources. Likewise, while studying enduring rivals could address some of the challenges around establishing causal connections (as well as eliminating biases in case selection), it is questionable whether such enduring rivals and conflicts in the cyber domain exist, or whether scholars can acquire enough relevant information about them to allow such research. Cyber deterrence scholars, therefore, experience significant challenges because of difficulties identifying cases of deterrence success or failure. While these problems accompany the study of deterrence in general—both quantitative and qualitative works—they are worse in the study of cyber deterrence and intensify other challenges. Under these conditions, researchers need to go back to the same case studies, in this way possibly missing other important factors affecting the practices of deterrence.\n## Toward a Methodology for Studying Cyber Deterrence\nThe challenges discussed above, and the limited applicability of current solutions to address them, increase the attractiveness of an alternative methodological solution to explore cyber deterrence. While, it is impossible to fully resolve all the challenges in the study of cyber deterrence, this article provides some directions toward this goal. I advance a solution based on studying the adoption of cyber deterrence strategy. By the adoption of cyber deterrence strategy, I refer to one of two things: (1) a strategic change, in which an actor moves toward a decision to rely on at least one type of cyber deterrence strategy (e.g., punishment, denial, detection),\nOn policy decisions to reveal or conceal experiencing cyberattacks, see Baram and Sommer (2019).\nGiven how difficult it is for the defender to identify the need to issue an immediate cyber deterrence threat, the fact that a defender successfully identifies this need may itself affect its ability to issue a successful deterrent threat. Whereas in other domains the putative challenger may also attempt to disguise its attempt to attack, defender actors have more means to identify it prior to the attack.\nAMIR LUPOVICI\n\nStudying the adoption of deterrence strategies has not been given enough scholarly attention. Indeed, my exploration of this phenomenon overlaps with various studies on different types of deterrence strategies (e.g., nuclear, conventional). Some scholars, as noted above, have even started to specifically study cyber deterrence adoption (Kugler 2009, 311–13; Stevens 2012; Adamsky 2018; Healey 2019; Gold 2020, 8–21; Wilner 2020). Nonetheless, few of these studies theorize this adoption, being more interested in the historical process through which deterrence was embraced. Furthermore, these scholars do not see research on adoption of the strategy as a methodological solution to challenges in studying deterrence.\nIn contrast, I suggest focusing on the adoption of deterrence strategy as a way to address the methodological challenges of studying (cyber) deterrence. Such a focus allows scholars to explore the various ways actors adopt this strategy and to apply different methods to ascertain this phenomenon and explain it. But before detailing the advantages of studying the adoption and employment of deterrence strategies, it is useful to categorize them. For example, the various ways actors adopt cyber deterrence strategies can be categorized based on the threat they aim to dissuade and their types, means, and degrees of explicitness.\n## The Undesired Activity to Be Deterred\nActors can use cyber deterrence to deter threats not only in the cyber domain but also in other domains. In the former, the strategy of cyber deterrence can be used to deter different types of cyber threats that vary in intensity, complexity, and feasibility (e.g., Brantly 2016, 116–17; Burton 2018, 28–29). Brantly, for example, distinguishes three main categories of activities actors attempt to deter: cyberattacks, cyber espionage, and cyber theft (Brantly 2020, 8–9). Defending actors may also develop a cross-domain deterrence strategy to dissuade threats conducted through cyber space that target supply chains or critical infrastructures or that may affect military activities and effectiveness (Schneider 2019a, 103, 108–9).\nOther categories of employing cyber deterrence strategy concern the use of cyber means to dissuade attacks in kinetic domains (Lupovici 2016a, 325). For example, cyber means may bolster conventional deterrence (Schneider 2019a, 115–19, but see Libicki 2016, 281). In a similar way, cyber means may affect nuclear deterrence. Some scholars estimate that advances in artificial intelligence may undermine nuclear deterrence (Lieber and Press 2017, 10; Horowitz 2019, 782; Johnson 2020, 429–38). However, others who study developments in Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA), including the advancement of autonomous machines and computerized devices, point to how in some situations these systems may enhance deterrence vis-à-vis different kinds of kinetic attacks (Fortmann and Von Hlatky 2009, 309–12).\nA related question about the type of threat is the specific phase of the cyberattack defenders wish to deter. Brantly and Smeets (forthcoming, 4–5) distinguish among different stages of cyberattack, such as the penetration of the defender’s system to\n Some scholars indirectly refer to the adoption of the strategy while studying “deterrence success” as part of operationalizing deterrence threat. For example, in defining the issuing of an immediate extended deterrent threat, Huth and Russett argue that scholars need to focus on “observable behavioral indicators in the form of statements and military actions that signal the threat to use force if the protégé is attacked.” According to them, even if this is a bluff, it is part of practicing deterrence (Huth and Russett 1990, 488). However, their goal of operationalizing the issuing of the deterrent threat is to establish covariance as part of explaining deterrence success.\n This type of approach is clearly evident in Freedman and Michaels’ (2019) seminal book on the evolution of nuclear strategies in different periods of time and in different countries.\n In addition, scholars refer to more specific challenges, such as deterring the use of information warfare through cyber platforms (Whyte 2020b, 237–39).\nA Methodology for Cyber Deterrence Research\ninstall the means of attack and the execution of the attack to actually generate the damage.\n## Types of Deterrent Strategies\nActors differ in what specific type of deterrent strategies, or combination of them, they adopt. Currently, in addition to deterrence by punishment, scholars tend to emphasize the following types of cyber deterrence strategies: tailored deterrence (Kugler 2009), punctuated/cumulative deterrence (Kello 2017; Tor 2017, 205–11), deterrence by denial (Iasiello 2013; Libicki 2016, 268–70; Nye 2017, 56–7), deterrence by detection or by accusation (Lindsay and Gartzke 2018, 192; Finnemore and Hollis 2020, 980–81), and deterrence by naming and shaming and through development of international norms (Nye 2017, 60–62; Stevens 2012; see also Libicki 2009, 68).\n## The Deterrent Means\nNot only can actors adopt different types of cyber deterrence strategies, but they can also employ each strategy with different means. For example, deterrence by punishment may be based not only on the defender’s cyber means, but also on its economic, diplomatic, and kinetic means (e.g., Kugler 2009, 328; Jasper 2017, 95–96; Schneider 2019a). In a similar way, actors can employ deterrence by denial not only by communicating their defensive means, but also by communicating their means to avoid the damage, such as by establishing backup systems to ensure the resilience of the information infrastructures (see also Nye 2017, 57).\n## Degree of Explicitness\nWhether and how actors publicly declare they will respond to a challenge is fundamental to understanding these practices in any domain of conflict (Brantly 2016, 113). Given the fact that communicating threats is a core element of deterrence strategy, the degree of explicitness is a key characteristic of how cyber deterrence strategy is adopted and employed. Deterrent threats are communicated through a wide spectrum of expressions—ranging from full explicitness to lack of any reference to the deterrent threat—that contain three main elements:\nOne element is how the threat is articulated and directed at an opponent: for example, whether the threat is generally stated in a strategic document (e.g., Department of Defense 2011) or the defender targets specific opponents (e.g., Department of Defense 2018, 1).\nA second element is how explicitly the undesired activity the defender wants to prevent is communicated. Scholars have debated over this issue when studying deterrence in other domains, contemplating whether a red line should be clearly stated or not (e.g., Lockhart 1978, 548–51; Schelling 1981, 38–41).\nA third element is the extent to which the deterrent threat itself is communicated. Actors differ in how explicitly they present the consequences that will stem from the challenger’s undesired activity: whether, for example, the defender specifies the retaliatory punishment or only presents it generally. A number of US documents have stated that the United States preserves the right to retaliate against a cyberattack with all the means they hold (Department of Defense 2011, 2; Department of Defense 2013, 32, 41–42; see also in Healey 2019; and in Wilner 2020). While some argue that actors can achieve a deterrent effect by specifying what a retaliatory strike will include (to a specific challenger) (e.g., Kugler 2009, 331–32), others suggest that states often issue a more general threat, using ambiguity as a mechanism of deterrence (e.g., Brantly 2016, 114). Conversely, actors may refrain from explicitly\nAMIR LUPOVICI\n\nOther possibilities exist between full explicitness and non-explicitness in communicating deterrent threats. Kugler (2009, 311–3), for example, reviews key US documents since 2003 and concludes that while they acknowledge the need to develop cyber deterrence strategy, they do not elaborate on how it can be attained. Likewise, actors, such as in the Israeli case, may discuss the need to adopt a strategy of cyber deterrence or wish to develop such a strategy but refrain from directly and explicitly issuing deterrent threats. In the last decade, senior Israeli policymakers have made the point that Israel should acquire a cyber deterrence strategy. For example, when serving as minister of defense, Ehud Barak suggested that in the uncertainty that cyber capabilities create, “leadership is required to show the way as to how to do the right thing for Israel and to establish a deterrent balance” (Barak 2012). Prime Minister Netanyahu also explained the need to develop a cyber deterrence strategy despite the fact that “[t]he ability to deter is more difficult because the source of such an attack is more anonymous. This is a problem we will certainly have to address” (Netanyahu 2011).\nInterestingly, in May 2020, it seems that Israel has moved to adopt an even more explicit cyber deterrence strategy when its retaliation against targets in Iran in response to a cyberattack on water infrastructures in Israel was reported (Warrick and Nakashima 2020). The publication of the Israeli retaliation, as well as other statements made by Israeli officials such as by Minister of Defense, Naftali Bennett, were interpreted as an attempt of Israel to send deterrent messages to the Iranians and to draw a red line (Siman Tov and Even 2020).\nSending deterrent messages through acts of retaliation is closely related to the concepts of punctuated deterrence and cumulative deterrence, where the actual use of force aims to punish and deliver a threatening message over a long period of time (Kello 2017, 205–11; Tor 2017). Even before the incidents of May 2020, some experts interpreted Israel’s offensive cyber capabilities in this context, claiming they aim in part to deter potential challengers and “show potential attackers what Israel is able to do if it chooses to respond to an attack” (Cohen, Freilich and Siboni 2016, 313).\nSome degree of explicitness—and thus communication and signaling—is a crucial aspect of these practices. According to Kello (2017, 209), “Diplomatic and signaling procedures will be required to demonstrate to adversaries that for the purpose of punishment, individual hostile actions are regarded as a comprehensive package of offensive activity rather than being disparate actions that merit isolated responses.” Likewise, as Tor (2017, 107) asserts, just the use of force is insufficient in creating a cumulative cyber deterrent strategy, as there is also a need to “to outline the ‘rules of the game’ in a clear way.”\n## Advantages in Focusing on Adoption of Cyber Deterrence Strategy\nFocusing on the adoption and employment of cyber deterrence has a number of theoretical and methodological advantages: it diversifies research by highlighting an overlooked phenomenon, it invites plural approaches and methods that help to better explain and understand actors’ behavior, and it thus emphasizes\n In this respect, comparing US documents reveals a growing specification of cyber deterrence strategies over the years (e.g., in Kugler 2009, 311–13).\n Examples of less explicit messages that serve deterrent goals can be found in leaking of information around cyberattacks—such as Stuxnet, the corruption of Syria’s air defense system, the Chinese penetration of American health insurer files, and the Russian hack into the US Democratic Party files (Perkovich and Levite 2017, 273; see also Mazanec and Thayer 2014, 69).\nA Methodology for Cyber Deterrence Research\nthe importance of various strategic, normative, and cultural aspects related to this phenomenon. While to some extent these advantages could also be achieved by diverting the study around cyber deterrence failure/success to these directions, the main advantage lies in the observability that studying the adoption of the strategy allows. Not only does this advantage stand by its own in improving our understanding of the practices of cyber deterrence, but it also enhances the other advantages: diversification of the research and the use of plural methods.\n## Observability\nThe main advantage of studying the adoption and employment of deterrence strategy is the ability to trace empirical evidence of it. The idea behind a strategy of deterrence, as discussed above, is to issue and communicate threats. The communication can be more or less explicit—and can even be a bluff; however, it is a crucial part of practicing this strategy.\nEven if the deterrent threat is a bluff, the methodological solution based on studying the adoption and employment of (cyber) deterrent strategy cannot be dismissed based on an assertion that issuing deterrent threats is cheap talk. Given the cult of reputation and practitioners' worry about resolve (e.g., Tang 2005; Kertzer 2016), a defender may find it costly to not execute the deterrent threat or retaliate in case the undesired attack has been made by the putative challenger. They may fear that other actors will challenge them in the future because of the alleged demonstration of weakness. Actors thus are likely to take the adoption of cyber deterrence strategy and the issuing of deterrent threat seriously; issuing deterrent threats, therefore, provides indications of an actor's strategy.\nFocusing on observable indications allows scholars to address challenges in the study of cyber deterrence that stem from limited access to details around practicing cyber deterrence that in many cases remain unknown, such as the attack, the damage, and when the defender identified it was attacked. First, the problem of the dog that did not bark and the problem of the dog that should have barked become less pressing. Focusing on strategy adoption and the issuing of deterrent threat involves observing changes in the behavior of the defender actor. From this perspective, and as further discussed below, scholars can study nuances in strategy adoption, conduct comparisons among actors and over time, and explain this phenomenon regardless of the putative challenger's behavior or of the deterrence strategy outcomes. In other words, the research will not be biased toward studying specific cases of deterrence failure.\nStudying cyber deterrence strategy adoption also addresses challenges around the dog that did bark problem. By focusing mainly on the behavior of the defender actor, scholars have much less difficulty in interpretation, as the outcome to be examined and explained is less ambiguous. Indeed, scholars may debate over whether an actor actually adopted a cyber deterrence strategy, how it differs from its previous strategies, and about its specific elements. However, because adopting and employing a strategy of deterrence requires some degree of explicitness—unlike deterrence successes and even cyber deterrence failures—scholars also have much more access to empirical evidence to discuss and dispute.\n Likewise, as Libicki (2016, 227) and Tor (2017, 107) note actors may deliver their deterrent messages not only in public channels but also in secret ones. While for scholars the delivering of deterrent messages secretly poses difficulties of observing and studying the occurrences, actors have incentives to make some public manifestations of the deterrent threat they issue, even indirectly, in order to target larger audiences. In addition, the focus of the suggested methodology is on the strategy, and not necessarily on the communication of a specific threat to a certain opponent. For example, in theory, a cyber deterrence strategy may be adopted explicitly, but the explicit strategic document may also acknowledge that in some situations the communication of the deterrent threat will be delivered privately.\n For further discussion of costly signals, cheap talk, and deterrence, see Fearon (2002, 13–16), Lupton (2018, 64), but also see Danilovic (2002, 130–40).\nIn addition, studying cyber deterrence strategy adoption makes more effective use of the methodological solutions traditional deterrence scholars offer to the challenges of exploring this strategy. First, scholars have pointed in different ways to the need to selectively choose case studies, such as studying critical cases of deterrence failure, or studying enduring rivals. While the main solution this article offers is somewhat different—focusing on the adoption/employment of the strategy—in fact, these solutions complement each other: for example, exploring the adoption, changes, and abandoning of cyber deterrence strategies over time between enduring rivals.\nOther solutions have aimed to better establish the causal mechanism (of deterrence success). Because of the observability of both cyber deterrence adoption and the elements that may account for it, the solution of developing specific hypotheses about the defender, the challenger, and the situation is useful direction to take. Scholars can observe the characteristics of cyber deterrence strategy adoption (e.g. explicitness, timing, the type of the cyber deterrence, the means to establish it, and the kind of challenge it aims to dissuade). In a similar way, scholars can provide various factors affecting such adoption, including elements of perceptions, culture, and norms on the one hand, and the strategic utility of the strategy on the other. Likewise, as further discussed below, they may explore the social context in which the strategy is embedded.\nFocusing on the adoption of the strategy is closely related to another solution advised by traditional deterrence scholars—that is, to rely on primary sources. Strategy adoption, being observable, provides sources to empirically establish the study of cyber deterrence. However, focusing on adoption also opens up other types of sources. Strategic documents establish the employment of the strategy, such as the US Department of Defense Cyberspace Policy Report, Department of Defense Defense Science Board, and the Department of Defense Cyber Strategy. Other relevant sources help to understand and explain how actors adopt cyber deterrence strategy, in this way exploring the various elements presented above. For example, primary documents that trace how perceptions on cyber (domain) change over time and how the cyber (domain) is constructed (e.g. in Raymond 2019, 203--35) could provide an account of changes in actors' willingness to employ this strategy in the cyber domain.\nThe methodological solution I propose—focusing on the adoption and employment of the strategy rather on deterrence success—provides important indications of actors' perceptions of the strategy's effectiveness. Scholars can explore specific cases and conduct longitudinal and cross-sectional comparisons of actors who adopt (or refrain from adopting) cyber deterrence strategy. For example, a growing international tendency to rely on this strategy may imply increasing effectiveness of the strategy or at least an increase in the perception of its effectiveness. Indeed, there are different explanations as to why actors adopt and employ a strategy of (cyber) deterrence—and these should be explored. Nonetheless, given the limited access to information about deterrence success, solutions based on focusing on the strategy's adoption provide important alternatives.\nTechnological developments provide one explanation (or hypothesis) for the adoption of cyber deterrence strategy. For example, given the problem of attribution, technologies that help defenders trace the source of an attack may enhance this strategy's efficiency and hence its attractiveness. In a similar way, improvements in defensive measures, measures to increase resilience, and organization skills in operating these measures (Slayton 2017, 89--90, e.g. Matania and Tal-Shir 2020) may make strategies of deterrence by denial more attractive. While these are plausible hypotheses, we cannot reduce the adoption of (cyber) deterrence strategies to technological advancement. Other explanations could be developed, for example,\nA Methodology for Cyber Deterrence Research\nbased on actors' (strategic) culture (e.g., Knopf 2013, 9–10). A number of reviews of cyber security policies and strategies of different countries (e.g., Luijjf, Besseling, Spoelstra, and De Graaf 2013; Liveri and Sarri 2014; Baezner and Cordey 2019) provide not only the social context of cyber deterrence strategies, but also information to help explain their adoption (or lack thereof). The strategic, political, and cultural elements these reports review are useful points of departure toward that goal.\nInternational norms could also affect the adoption of cyber deterrence strategy. Nye, for example, suggests that deterrence through the establishment of international norms is one means of employing cyber deterrence. This strategy is based on creating taboos that increase the costs of attacking certain cyber targets (e.g., civilian cyber infrastructures) (Nye 20167, 60–62). From this perspective, the emergence of norms incentivizes actors to rely on practices of deterrence and adopt and employ them. Furthermore, the emergence of new norms can also affect other types of deterrence strategy, including deterrence by punishment. Actors may be more motivated to adopt such a strategy, for example, if cyberattacks are constructed as acts of violence. Seeing a challenge as “violent” increases an actor’s willingness to employ threats to dissuade it, thus enhancing deterrence effectiveness. The existence of a norm that portrays cyberattacks in this way legitimizes a retaliatory strike and thus the adoption of this strategy in the first place (Lupovici 2016a, 333–34). In recent years, scholars have begun to explore how public perceptions of cyber conflicts and dynamics affect support for retaliation against cyberattacks (Kreps and Schneider 2019; Shandler, Gross, and Canetti 2021). Public attitudes open up a broad area for research connecting normative, political, and institutional factors that also affect the adoption of cyber deterrence strategies.\n## Diversifying Cyber Deterrence Research\nBy focusing on the strategy’s adoption, we can examine and compare various kinds of actors, especially actors other than those commonly examined. In particular, the United States is overrepresented in the research. There are a number of reasons for this—including that many scholars are American and aim to influence the US strategy, that the United States is considered a cyber power, and the greater availability of American documents. Therefore, US cyber deterrence will probably continue to be closely examined.\nHowever, the observability of the adoption and employment of the strategy makes information on other cases also relatively accessible, which may help to fill the gap and advance our understanding of other countries. One of the research puzzles concerns actors who have not adopted an explicit cyber deterrence strategy—Israel being a key example. Despite the fact that deterrence is a strategy Israel has adopted vis-à-vis various threats (Lupovici 2016b), so far Israel has refrained from issuing direct cyber deterrent threats.\nDiversifying the research to include other states is also intriguing given the differing views on the strategy of deterrence and cyber security. Studying whether and how these actors adopt and employ cyber deterrence strategies helps to develop a more nuanced understanding of what cyber deterrence is and why and how it is used.\nWe can also extend the study of cyber deterrence to explore non-state actors. In recent years, deterrence scholarship has started to acknowledge other actors involved in the practices of deterrence (Paul, Morgan, and Wirtz 2009). Scholars have explored not only how states attempt to deter non-states threats (e.g., Wilner 2015, 37–74), but also how different kinds of non-state actors, such as terrorist\nI discuss below some more specific cultural explanations for adopting a strategy of deterrence.\nFor further discussion on the question of “violence,” use of force, cyberattacks, and legitimate retaliation, see Waxman (2011), Harrison Dinniss (2012, 63–75), Schmitt (2017, chapter 14, 16), and Schneider (2019a, 115).\nAMIR LUPOVICI\n\n## Inviting Plural Research Methods\nThe study of the adoption and employment of cyber deterrence strategies invites positivist and interpretative methods. Positivist scholars can study causal mechanisms of this phenomenon through quantitative and qualitative methods. Scholars can focus on specific case studies or conduct longitudinal and cross-sectional comparative works on actors who adopted, were late to adopt, or did not adopt cyber deterrence strategy.\nFocusing on adoption is a promising direction for examining whether, how, and why an actor adopts and employs a certain type of cyber deterrence strategy. One option is to explore the evolution of the strategy: for example, by tracing a shift in a state’s cyber strategy. The changes in 2018 in US cyber policy provide a useful demonstration of these dynamics, illustrating the advantages of the suggested framework. In 2018, the United States adopted a cyber strategy based on *defend forward* and *persistent engagement* (e.g., compare Department of Defense 2011 with Department of Defense 2018; see also Healey 2019; Kosseff 2019, 5; Wilner 2020, 266–67). While there is debate over how far this strategy diverts from an emphasis on deterrence, experts ascribe the shift to the limited applicability of deterrence strategy in the cyber domain (e.g., Fischerkeller and Harknett 2017; see also King and Gallagher 2020, 27–28).\nThis policy change led to some interesting questions. Foremost, the timing of this shift is worth exploring. Doubts over the effectiveness of cyber deterrence strategy were expressed as early as the 1990s. This implies that the 2018 change was informed by notions beyond those of the limitations of cyber deterrence strategy—for example, by the acknowledgment that adversaries in cyber space are in constant contact (e.g., Fischerkeller and Harknet 2017; Fischerkeller, Harknett, and Vičić 2020, 25–30). This shows that acceptance of new ideas and their successful promotion by individuals and networks may also be crucial in accounting for this change. Healey suggests that the change “stems directly from this Goldman–Fischerkeller–Harknett lineage (and subsequently drove the DoD Cyber Strategy and parts of the White House National Cyber Strategy). This is perhaps unsurprising “as all three are international relations scholars who have worked at US Cyber Command” (Healey 2019, 5). Processes of learning, persuasion, and individual characteristics can all help to explain whether and how cyber deterrence strategy is shifting, accepted, and employed.\nLearning may be also seen as a result of cyberattacks experienced by the United States, which led practitioners to emphasize the need to shift to persistent engagement. Whyte (2020a, 210–11) summarizes this point: “[N]umerous commentators . . . note the significance of Russian political warfare in 2016 as a realisation mo\n Likewise, Libicki concludes that the United States should not make cyber deterrence an explicit strategy and that it should not rely on it (Libicki 2016, 266).\n For similar dynamics regarding learning nuclear deterrence, see Kaplan (1991), Adler (1992), and Evangelista (1999). These studies show, in different ways, that although technological developments are crucial, they are insufficient to account for the adoption of deterrence strategies.\nA Methodology for Cyber Deterrence Research\nment prompting the development of the new, more assertive strategy.” Structural changes also allowed for and guided this shift. For example, comparing the 2018 cyber strategy with its predecessor (DoD 2015), Kollars and Schneider (2018) note “The 2018 Cyber Strategy reflects the changes in the political, technical, and institutional environment over the last three years.”\nAnother research direction that focuses on the adoption of the strategy could examine the exact nature, rather the efficiency, of the strategy: that is, examining whether and which type of deterrence strategy the new adopted policy aims to advance. Scholars have debated over whether the 2018 strategy emphasizes deterrence strategy (see, Healey 2019, 3–4). On the one hand, it was developed and justified based on the limits of cyber deterrence as discussed above. For example, Kreps and Schneider (2019, 9) assert that persistent engagement is better suited than deterrence. According to them, “[D]eterrence hinges on public resolve for overwhelming uses of force and a willingness to escalate, which appears lacking in the cyber domain, whereas persistent engagement can operate at a lower intensity of confrontation—albeit one that is relatively continuous—that gains legitimacy by virtue of the public support.”\nNonetheless, while experts acknowledge the shift in the US strategy, they also point to different types of deterrence strategy that the new policy emphasizes and to how it might actually enhance the US deterrent posture. For Whyte (2020a, 210), the new strategy marks a shift from deterrence by denial to a kind of deterrence by punishment. Likewise, Kollars and Schneider (2018) identify a specific shift in US strategy toward tailored deterrence against China and Russia, compared with a former comprehensive cyber deterrence strategy vis-à-vis a “wide array of actors and actions.” Furthermore, persistent engagement based on offensive action might strengthen deterrence strategy by signaling resolve and establishing escalation dominance (Kollars and Schneider 2018; Miller and Pollard 2019; Valeriano and Jensen 2019). In a similar way, the US Cyber Command Vision statement implements the idea of persistent engagement as a way to enhance the US deterrent posture. According to this document, “Through persistent action and competing more effectively below the level of armed conflict, we can influence the calculations of our adversaries, deter aggression, and clarify the distinction between acceptable and unacceptable behavior in cyberspace” (USCYBERCOM 2018, 6).\nThese discussions demonstrate not only the importance of looking into a cyber (deterrence) strategy, explaining it, and analyzing its components, but also the feasibility of conducting such research. Although, scholars can interpret the evidence differently, and the meaning and implications of the strategy may change over time, there is accessible and important evidence to work with. Furthermore, it helps to demonstrate how the suggested methodology provides an alternative to the challenges of studying deterrence success. While we still have little information about the outcomes of this strategy, we can start by considering the various aspects of its adoption.\nIn addition to focusing on one case study or on shifts in actors’ cyber deterrence strategy, such as the those discussed above (the case of Israel response in May 2020 and the 2018 US policy), scholars can also conduct broader comparisons. These can explore the reasons for the differences in how countries adopt and employ cyber deterrence strategies or compare an actor’s adoption and employment of cyber deterrence strategy with its adoption and employment of deterrence strategy\n The idea of persistent engagement sparked a debate over whether and to what extent cyber operations are effective in attaining strategic goals, and specifically whether and how they contribute to cyber deterrence success. While scholars acknowledged a number of advantages of the new policy, they were also worried that the criteria for success of this new strategy are not entirely clear; that employing it might be too costly; that it might lead to escalation; and that it may deteriorate US relationships with its allies (Healey 2019, 7–11; Lin and Smeets 2019; Miller and Pollard 2019; Smeets 2019a; Schneider 2019b; Smeets 2019b; Valeriano and Jensen 2019).\nAMIR LUPOVICI\n\nAn obvious advantage here is the access to comparable information and data. Scholars, thus, not only can conduct quantitative research that explores different aspects of the adoption of cyber deterrence strategies, but can also use data sets already available. This direction accords with Pytlak and Mitchell’s (2016, 79) recommendation to develop new techniques to address and use data in a way that overcomes the limited “amount of information publicly available.”\nBased on the data collected and analyzed by Brantly (2016), Valeriano, Jensen, and Maness (2018), and Kostyuk and Zhukov (2019), scholars are able to develop interesting notions about the adoption of deterrence strategy. For example, following these studies, it is possible to ask whether actors who absorbed significant cyberattacks tend to consider adopting cyber deterrence strategies to balance their insecurities, or whether more powerful actors tend to rely on this strategy, for example, based on long-term deterrence through previous execution of cyber means (i.e., cumulative cyber deterrence). These notions fit some of the assertions Valeriano et al. make, such as those about credibility and signaling (Valeriano, Jensen, and Maness 2018, 46–47), as well as about the long-term aims of cyber operations (Valeriano, Jensen, and Maness 2018, 11). Similarly, the cyber power score Brantly (2016, 138–40, 169) develops enables some hypotheses about the adoption of cyber deterrence strategies: for example, whether weaker states tend to adopt deterrence strategies to balance their inferiority (e.g., explicitly adopt the strategy) or to avoid it, fearing that adopting it will contribute to escalation. Based on these data, scholars can also compare whether and why different actors adopt different types of cyber deterrence strategies: for example, whether weaker actors rely on strategies such as deterrence by naming and shaming or deterrence by detection.\nThe suggested methodology based on studying the adoption of the strategy not only enables positivistic studies, but may also fit well with interpretative frameworks and research on deterrence. Interpretative scholars who study deterrence have started to employ discourse analysis to examine the practices of deterrence (Cohn 1987; Luke 1989; Dauber 1993; Harrington 2016; Vuori 2016). While these methods have not been fully applied to study cyber deterrence, this could be done through focusing on the adoption and employment of the strategy and on the language used. One specific promising direction is to study the adoption and employment of deterrence as securitizing moves (Lupovici 2019). Scholars have started to explore different securitizing moves related to cyber (Bendrath, Eriksson, and Giacomello 2007; Dunn Cavelty 2008; Hansen and Nissenbaum 2009; Deibert and Rohozinski 2010; Dunn Cavelty 2013; Stevens 2016). Looking into the adoption of cyber deterrence strategy provides intriguing cases to further apply the theory of securitization to traditional security challenges. This direction may cover various securitizing moves: for example, the American attempt to securitize cyber challenges to justify various means of retaliation, including even nuclear weapons, in the case of an “existential cyber attack” (Department of Defense 2013, 42; see also Wilner 2020, 261).\nIn a similar way, interpretative approaches highlight the importance of the social context in which deterrence strategy is embedded. These notions can be also ap-\n One goal of comparing cyber deterrence with deterrence in other domains is to validate the assertion that the adoption of cyber deterrence may indicate, even indirectly, deterrence success, as discussed above.\n Likewise, reports that document cyber incidents may also prove useful in tracing previous cyber operations and their influence on actors’ adoption of cyber deterrence strategies; see, for example, the project of the Council on Foreign Relations at https://www.cfr.org/cyber-operations.\nA Methodology for Cyber Deterrence Research\nplied to study cyber deterrence: for example, in examining how the strategy's adoption and employment are shaped by international norms, (strategic) culture, and actors' identity. This is important to better understand how and why actors adopt cyber deterrence strategies, but also because the way the strategy is adopted indicates and reflects political, normative, and cultural elements. Although scholars have not used these elements to study cyber deterrence adoption (but see Adamsky 2018), they have explained deterrence strategy adoption and employment in other domains by pointing to strategic culture (Basrur 2006, 49–79; Adamsky 2017, 166–71), norms (Tannenwald 2007, 45, 291–92), practices (Adler and Pouliot 2011, 9–15, 21–28), rituals (Mälksoo 2021), and actors' identity, emotions, and ontological security (Tannenwald 2007, 45–46; Lupovici 2016b). The adoption and employment of cyber deterrence strategy provide another arena to examine and employ these theories.\n# Conclusions\nThis article suggests that focusing on the adoption and employment of cyber deterrence strategy—rather than studying cyber deterrence success—promises to provide solutions to the methodological challenges associated with the study of this strategy. This article does not claim to advance the only way to explore cyber deterrence. On the contrary, scholars may well find methodological alternatives, as there is still need to collect and analyze data and case studies on deterrence failure/success. Nonetheless, based on clarifying methodological challenges and by offering a categorization of different characteristics of how (cyber) deterrence strategies are adopted, I point to a phenomenon that has received insufficient attention, and studying it carries a number of advantages. Among other things, it provides methodological solutions, it helps diversify the research of deterrence, and it invites plural approaches and methods. This paper thus should be seen as a point of departure for further research and as a call to focus on the adoption and employment of the strategy.\nMore generally, I suggest that elaborating on these issues contributes not only to the study of cyber deterrence, but also to the two fields of research: deterrence and cyber. For the former, the advantage lies in reframing methodological problems and challenges that may be relevant for scholars who explore not only cyber deterrence. Another advantage for deterrence research, in general, lies in studying an understudied phenomenon. More scholarly work has been done on the adoption and employment of deterrence strategies (mainly of nuclear deterrence, e.g., Kaplan 1991; Adler 1992; Evangelista 1999; Freedman and Michaels 2019) than on the adoption of cyber deterrence strategies. Nonetheless, while the study of deterrence strategy adoption lags behind the study of deterrence success, it may well complement it. From this perspective, this article provides a first step in developing a methodology to study the adoption and employment of different types of deterrence strategies in different domains and with different deterrent means.\nThis is, furthermore, an important phenomenon on its own. It may indicate various aspects about actors' strategic thinking, perceptions, culture, and identity. Understanding how, when, and why actors adopt and employ deterrence strategies (or change or abandon them) in various domains may also further the study of cyber deterrence adoption and employment. The study of more traditional strategies of deterrence may reveal additional explanations and possible characteristics to examine, explain, and compare. Conversely, studying the adoption of cyber deterrence may advance the study of more traditional strategies of deterrence. Most notably, studying cyber deterrence emphasizes that adoption of deterrence strategies cannot be taken as given but requires explanation. It also reveals our assumptions in studying deterrence. For example, traditional studies of deterrence take as given that the challenge is an act of violence or that the timing of the attack and the tim\nAMIR LUPOVICI\n\nRegarding cyber studies, exploring the strategy's adoption may account for changes in actors' behavior. In other words, studying cyber deterrence adoption demonstrates how technological and normative changes affect cyber strategies. In a similar way, we can study how culture, on the one hand, and rational calculations, on the other hand, affect behavior in the cyber domain. Studying cyber deterrence adoption makes cyber behavior more observable. Therefore, we can draw implications from it that go beyond those related solely to deterrence.\n## Acknowledgments\nI would like to thank Patricia Greve, Gallia Lindenstrauss, and the three anonymous reviewers for their extremely helpful comments and suggestions on different drafts of this manuscript.

Studying cyber deterrence presents even greater challenges, as traditional deterrence challenges are exacerbated and interactions in the cyber domain create further difficulties. When studying cyber deterrence, scholars face uncertainty not only in identifying situations of deterrence success, but also—due to the secrecy surrounding cyber practices—in identifying situations of deterrence failure. Despite the many studies on cyber deterrence, methodological solutions to address these challenges still need to be developed. To this end, I suggest focusing on the adoption and employment of the strategy rather than on its success. I argue that since communicating threats is a core element of deterrence, it is easier to observe how the strategy is adopted and employed than whether it succeeds or fails. This focus provides a promising direction to study cyber deterrence and address these challenges.\nEl estudio de disuasión presenta una serie de desafíos, principalmente relacionados con la identificación de casos de éxito de disuasión y la definición de su funcionamiento. El estudio de la ciberdisuasión presenta desafíos aún mayores, ya que los desafíos tradicionales de la disuasión se ven exacerbados y las interacciones en el ámbito cibernético generan más dificultades. Al estudiar la ciberdisuasión, los académicos se enfrentan a la incertidumbre no solo a la hora de identificar situaciones de éxito de disuasión, sino también a la hora de identificar situaciones de fracaso de disuasión debido a la confidencialidad que gira en torno a las prácticas cibernéticas. A pesar de los numerosos estudios sobre la ciberdisuasión, todavía es necesario desarrollar soluciones metodológicas para abordar estos desafíos. Para lograrlo, sugiero enfocarse en la adopción e implementación de la estrategia más que en su éxito. Sostengo que, dado que comunicar amenazas es un elemento clave de la disuasión, es más fácil observar cómo se adopta e implementa la estrategia que identificar si tiene éxito o fracasa. Este enfoque marca un rumbo prometedor para estudiar la ciberdisuasión y abordar estos desafíos.\nL'étude de la dissuasion présente un certain nombre de défis qui sont principalement liés à l'identification de la réussite de la dissuasion et à la définition de la manière dont la dissuasion fonctionne.

While scholars have pointed to the challenges of practicing cyber deterrence, their focus—like that of most deterrence scholars—has been on deterrence success. Most studies assess whether and how deterrence by punishment can be applied to the cyber domain (e.g., in Wilner 2020, 252–54), or whether and how it should be replaced with other strategies or types of deterrence, such as deterrence by denial (Iasiello 2013), or by cumulative deterrence (Tor 2017). These studies are part of the tendency Stevens (2016, 24) observes of cyber security studies to be “commonly oriented towards policy concerns.” Nonetheless, less attention is given to methodological challenges around studying cyber deterrence. This article aims to advance the methodology of studying (cyber) deterrence by offering a categorization of the methodological challenges concerning studying deterrence and by offering an alternative way to explore this strategy.\nInspired by the dog that did not bark problem—a bias in the study of deterrence toward cases of deterrence failure (Sauer 2016, 49)—I categorize three clusters of problems regarding the study of deterrence. Besides the dog that did not bark problem, I group additional challenges into two clusters of problems that I term the dog that did bark and the dog that should have barked problems. The former refers to challenges around interpreting cases of deterrence success and failure, and the latter to a bias that stems from the difficulty of identifying attacks and therefore seeing them as deterrence failures.\nBased on this categorization, I review and illustrate the challenges in studying cyber deterrence and the limited applicability of the current solutions offered to address them. These challenges include identifying deterrence success, selecting appropriate cases, and establishing causal connections between issuing the deterrent threat and deterrence success. While these problems generally characterize the study of deterrence, they are exacerbated in studying cyber deterrence, mainly because we cannot observe cyber deterrence successes and failures.\nI claim that one way to solve the challenges in studying cyber deterrence strategy is to shift focus from deterrence success to its adoption and employment. While this is\nStudying the adoption of cyber deterrence strategies overlaps with broader attempts to explore the motivation behind cyber strategies (e.g., Valeriano, Jensen, and Maness 2018; Gomez 2021).\nA Methodology for Cyber Deterrence Research\nnot the only solution—and indeed scholars still need to study deterrence success—I assert it provides a useful point of departure for thinking about and exploring this strategy.\nA number of scholars have begun to study the adoption of cyber deterrence strategies with illuminating insights (Kugler 2009, 311–13; Stevens 2012; Adamsky 2018; Healey 2019; Gold 2020, 8–21; Wilner 2020). While I rely on this scholarship, I also aim to advance it. The main goal for most of these works is to describe the evolution of the strategy rather than to explain the phenomenon of adopting the strategy. I suggest that using the adoption and employment of the strategy as the explained phenomenon (i.e., *explanandum*) is a promising method because of the observability of these aspects of the strategy. Communicating threats is a core element of a deterrence strategy, which makes the strategy’s adoption and employment much more explicit than its success or failure. This allows me to offer a categorization of how actors diverge in adopting and applying deterrence strategies, based on the goal, type, means, and explicitness of the strategy. This in turn provides a useful framework to study deterrence, and especially cyber deterrence strategies. Furthermore, as I demonstrate below, the study of the adoption and employment of cyber deterrence strategies encourages methodological pluralism, open to both positivist and interpretative methods.\nThe article proceeds as follows: In the first section, I discuss the main problems in the study of deterrence and the main solutions scholars offer to address them. In the second part, I specify the increased pressure of these challenges when studying cyber deterrence and argue that most solutions are not sufficient to remedy the problems. The third section develops a methodology for studying cyber deterrence, based on different characteristics that concern the adoption of the strategy. The fourth section shows and illustrates the promise of focusing on the adoption and employment of cyber deterrence to address the challenges. Such focus provides new research questions, explanations, and hypotheses, and diversifies the research of this strategy. I conclude by discussing the implications of this study on deterrence research in general and on cyber security research.\n## Methodological Challenges in Studying Deterrence\nScholars studying deterrence have paid a great deal of attention to methodological issues. While it is beyond this paper’s scope to discuss all the methodological challenges in the study of deterrence, I group the main challenges into three clusters. The first is based on what scholars refer to as the dog that did not bark problem. Building on this, I introduce two further problems: the dog that did bark and the dog that should have barked (see table 1).\n## The Dog That Did Not Bark\nThe dog that did not bark problem revolves around selection bias in studying cases of deterrence failure. Scholars are referring to Sherlock Holmes’ ability to solve a murder mystery based on the fact that a dog, present at the night of the murder, did not bark. Key to solving the case is the idea that there is meaning in the fact that something did not happen. The dog did not bark because the dog knew the perpetrator (see also Sauer 2016, 49). Based on this analogy, scholars have pointed to the flawed tendency to focus only on cases of deterrence failure, which provide\nFor reviews and comparisons of cyber strategies of different countries, see Thomas (2009), Lewis and Neuneck (2013), Luiijf, Besseling, Spoelstra, and De Graaf (2013), Liveri and Sarri (2014), and Baezner and Cordey (2019). See also King and Gallagher (2020, 144–45).\nThe debates over how to study deterrence, advanced not only research on deterrence and security, but also, and more broadly, studies in international relations (IR) and political science (e.g., see in King, Keohane, and Verba 1994, 24,134–35).\nAMIR LUPOVICI\n\nTable 1. Clusters of methodological challenges in the study of deterrence and cyber deterrence\n|  The problem | Description | Implications for the study of deterrence | Implications for the study of cyber deterrence  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  The dog that did not bark | The fact that the dog did not bark during a murder means something. In other words, it is important to analyze events that did not happen. | Scholars need to study not only cases of deterrence failure, but also cases of deterrence success (where allegedly nothing happens). However, the research suffers from a selection bias. Given the difficulties of studying cases of deterrence success, scholars tend to focus on studying cases of deterrence failure. | The selection bias is more challenging. Given the secrecy that surrounds interactions in the cyber domain, identifying cases of deterrence success is much more difficult, which further biases the study toward studying cases of deterrence failure.  |\n|  The dog that did bark | Interpreting events is very difficult. Dog’s barking does not necessarily mean that there was a murder, and vice versa (if the dog did not bark it does not mean that there was no murder). | Not only is the line between deterrence failure and success not clear-cut, but interpreting whether deterrence succeeded or failed based on the level of violence is problematic. Eruption of violence is not proof of deterrence failure, as lack of violence is not proof of deterrence success. | Interpreting events and concluding deterrence failure and success from observations is even more challenging given the secrecy surrounding cyber incidents and the ambiguity concerning what should be considered as violent attack (which constitute deterrence failure). Therefore, scholars face difficulties in classifying cases and in establishing (causal) explanations.  |\n|  The dog that should have barked | When the dog is not fully aware of the presence of a suspicious person, and therefore is not barking (e.g., in case of a murder, the dog is failing to notice or is noticing too late). | This challenge poses another sort of case selection bias, as obviously scholars are only able to study the cases they are aware of. | Scholars are not only biased toward studying cases of deterrence failure as indicated by the traditional challenge of studying deterrence. In cases of cyber deterrence, scholars are also not fully aware of cases of deterrence failure. This biases the research in different ways, including scholars’ tendency to focus on a limited number of known case studies of cyber deterrence failure for which relatively more information is available.  |\nA Methodology for Cyber Deterrence Research\nconsiderable observable traces to follow—the employment of violence by at least one of the parties (Achen and Snidal 1989, 161; Lebow and Stein 1990, 336, 347; King, Keohane, and Verba 1994, 24). Positivist scholars use this analogy to challenge scholars' ability to provide a full coloration given that they focus on one possible value of the examined variable of deterrence success—that is, deterrence failure. Some scholars have even suggested the problem is deeper, since focusing on deterrence failures leads to exploration of much more resolute actors—those “who select themselves into crises” and therefore are less likely to be deterred (Danilovic 2002, 117–19; Fearon 2002, 6, 14; see also Wilner 2015, 190, footnote 4, p. 241).\nWhile the problematic tendency to focus on cases of deterrence failure clearly exists, it should be noted that lack of violence is not a nonoccurrence. As Tannenwald, emphasizes, \"[T]here is no such thing as explaining a non-event . . . What is actually being explained is a contrast between an actual event and a possible alternative counterfactual event.\" What we are in fact asking is not why the dog did not bark, but why the dog was silent, as we have a reasonable expectation that in such situations the counterfactual (e.g., barking) is a likely scenario (Tannenwald 2007, 30). From this perspective, when deterrence succeeds (and there is no violence) something does happen: policymakers decide that the cost of violence is too high for them to pursue the act the defender aims to prevent. Put differently, it is not that nothing happened, but rather that we cannot easily see it.\n## The Dog That Did Bark\nI use the phrase the dog that did bark to refer to difficulties around interpreting observations. We cannot deduce an occurrence from an event that correlates with another event. Usually dogs bark when they notice a suspicious person (e.g., a potential murderer); however, of course, we cannot deduce, just because a dog barked that a murder has taken place. Similarly, in the absence of suspicious activity, dogs do not bark. But the fact a dog did not bark does not mean no crime occurred. This analogy allows us to group a number of challenges around determining deterrence failure and success and their implications.\nNotably, the eruption of violence does not necessarily indicate deterrence failure. First, deterrence success is not a binary variable. For example, some scholars argue that, unlike nuclear deterrence, in cases of low(er) levels of violence, decreasing the amount of violence can be considered deterrence success even if it does not totally prevent the violence (Rid 2012; Wenger and Wilner 2012, 318). Second, paradoxically, in some cases, deterrence success increases the level of violence, as an opponent can execute a challenge to provoke retaliation in order to attain political gain.\nNonetheless, not only can we not deduce deterrence failure from violence, but, and more importantly, we cannot deduce deterrence success from observing lack of violence. For example, there may be no challenger. As Morgan (2003, 121) argues, if a state \"has no intention of attacking the case cannot tell us whether deterrence works and how.\" In addition, even if the challenger has motivation to attack the defender, it may refrain for reasons other than the deterrent posture of the defender.\n\nAMIR LUPOVICI\n\n## The Dog That Should Have Barked\nWhile the two challenges presented above—the dog that did not bark and the dog that did bark—group and refer to known problems and biases in the study of deterrence, the dog that should have barked emphasizes a less-studied challenge. This problem stems from the expectation that the dog needs to bark if something suspicious is happening. As noted above, the counterfactual is that if the dog did not bark, it means something. However, inspired by this analogy we can also create a third cluster: a situation where the dog did not bark, but should have. While this can be seen as a subcategory of the dog that did not bark problem, the counterfactual here is different. Unlike the original, in which the dog had no reason to bark, in this situation, if the dog were aware of the occurrence, then it would definitely be barking. Nonetheless, the dog that should have barked problem also differs from the dog that did bark problem. The dog that did bark points to a situation in which the occurrence is known but its meaning is not. In the dog that should have barked, not only is the interpretation unclear, but what happened remains a mystery.\nFor the purpose of the study of deterrence, this analogy emphasizes situations in which practitioners are unaware of what happened, or at least of situations that have no public record.7 This means that scholars are limited in using these cases. Not only are they unaware of cases of deterrence success (as evident in the dog that did not bark problem), but they may also be unaware of cases of deterrence failure.\n## Current Solutions in Scholarship\nThe dog that did not bark and what I term the dog that did bark point to three main challenges in the study of deterrence: (1) bias in case selection; (2) difficulty of determining deterrence success and deterrence failure, and thus of classifying case studies; and (3) problems in establishing causality, that is, in showing that there is not only a correlation between the issuing of the threats and the avoidance of violence, but that the deterrent threat causes it (George and Smoke 1974, 90–93; Luke 1989, 214; Lebow and Stein 1990, 345; Freedman 2004, 13). Scholars offer a number of solutions to these challenges.\nFirst, scholars urge careful selection of case studies. Among other things, they recommend exploring critical case studies of deterrence failure (Lebow and Stein 1989, 221–22). In addition, Huth and Russett suggest focusing on immediate deterrence rather than on cases of general deterrence. Immediate deterrence is characterized by explicit threats or the movement of alerting military forces, and thus it provides the observer with “reasonable assessment of whether deterrence succeeded or failed” (Huth and Russett 1988, 30). Also, they suggest examining cases of both deterrence failure and deterrence success (Huth and Russett 1990,\ninvolvement in Syria since 2012 and especially since 2013, and the pressure from Iran not to waste resources (Lupovici 2016b, 183).\n7These situations usually result from what Baliga, Bueno De Mesquita, and Wolitzky (2020, 1055) refer to as detection failure, where defenders are unaware that an attack occurred.\nA Methodology for Cyber Deterrence Research\n468–73). However, as Jervis asserts, this solution is limited, as the important question is why deterrence fails and not the frequency of deterrence failures (Jervis 1989, 194).\nSecond, scholars suggest examining the long-term dynamics of enduring rivals to address a number of challenges in the study of deterrence (Stein 1996; Lieberman 2013; Danilovic and Clare 2017, 14–15). This enables the exploration not only of immediate deterrence, but also of general deterrence. Morgan (2003, 82) suggests that focusing only on crises is problematic since it prevents studying the inter-crises periods, which are crucial because actors often attempt to employ general deterrence strategy. Focusing on enduring rivals also addresses the bias in studying mainly cases of deterrence failure. It helps to establish the causal connections by addressing questions around whether the challenger seriously considered war or, if the challenger backed down, whether it was affected by the defender’s deterrent strategy. In addition, it helps to establish a more focused comparison because the same actors are examined over time. Finally, studying enduring rivals also addresses the challenge of identifying the defender and the challenger, by revealing shifts in actors’ balance of interests (Lieberman 2013, 29–32; see also Stein 1996).\nThird, scholars suggest dealing with the challenge of identifying deterrence success by developing hypotheses about the defender, the challenger, and the conflict (Stern, Axelrod, Jervis, and Rander 1989, 6, 19–21, 33). While this solution complements some other solutions, it leads in practice to debates around results without necessarily providing convincing explanations. A prime example of these limitations is the study of whether the actual use of force contributes to enhancing a deterrent posture and demonstrating resolve (Schelling 1966, 116–25; Mercer 1996; Press 2005; Tang 2005; Rid 2012, 128; Lupton 2018, 61–66). This issue is highly debated, and scholars suggest the empirical findings on it are inconclusive and that further research is needed (Huth 1997; Sartori 2005, 9; Weisiger and Yarhi-Milo 2015, 479).\nFourth, scholars have advised relying on primary sources and detailed historical accounts to better determine the defender and challenger and to better establish deterrence success (or failure). This will also decrease selection bias in the study of deterrence (Lebow and Stein 1990, 346–51). Following these ideas, Wilner (2011, 32–33), for example, suggests that primary sources are crucial to establishing the putative challenger’s intentions and how they change. While use of primary sources is promising, a common problem is the difficulty of accessing the kind of evidence needed. Leaders’ statements may not be sincere, especially around the effect of the deterrent threat on behavior. As Morgan asserts, the challenger “won’t announce that it backed down because it was scared: instead, it never planned to attack” (Morgan 2003, 122; see also Huth and Russett 1990, 491). Even in private discussions, policymakers tend not to admit the effect of the opponent’s deterrence strategy (Lebow and Stein 1989, 222). The sources that help address this challenge come from closed meetings, classified policy analyses, and military orders and assessments, all of which are hard to trace (Huth and Russett 1990, 491). However, they do provide much stronger evidence of whether and how deterrent threat shapes a putative challenger’s behavior.\n## Challenges in Studying Cyber Deterrence\nThe challenges around studying conventional and nuclear deterrence are much more pressing in the context of cyber deterrence. Not only do interactions in the\n\nAMIR LUPOVICI\n\n## Cyber Deterrence Research\nMost scholars acknowledge that cyber deterrence involves the use of threats to prevent cyberattacks or attacks on defender’s information systems (Stevens 2012, 149–52; Lupovici 2016a, 324–25). Many agree that successfully employing cyber deterrence strategy is difficult (in Morgan 2010; Stevens 2012, 149–53). Among other things, they argue that defending actors cannot easily pose a credible threat because of the difficulty of identifying the challenger, the large number of potential challengers, the asymmetry between the challengers and the defenders, the low entry costs, the limited public support to retaliate against cyberattacks, and the defenders’ difficulty exposing their capabilities (Harknett 1996; Molander, Riddle, and Wilson 1996, 87; Cordesman and Cordesman 2001, 7; Arquilla 2003, 210–13; Libicki 2007, 271–72; Libicki 2009, 1–3, 26, 44–45; Morgan 2010, 55–76; Geers 2011, 111–22; Fischerkeller and Harknett 2017, 386–87; Kreps and Schneider 2019; Fischerkeller, Harknett, and Vičić 2020, 25–30).\nIndeed, some scholars suggest various methods to enhance the effectiveness of deterrence strategy in dissuading cyberattacks. Recently, scholars have become more optimistic about achieving this goal. For example, scholars offer innovative ways to think about the implications of the attribution problem and how deterrence can work under imperfect attribution (Glaser 2011, 3; Baliga, Bueno De Mesquita, and Wolitzky 2020). Scholars also suggest that the attribution problem can be addressed in various, mainly technical and technological, ways (e.g., Rid and Buchanan 2014; Egloff and Dunn Cavelty 2021) and therefore should not necessarily prevent the execution of retaliation. Furthermore, the attribution problem is not a challenge for deterrence theory per se, but is shaped through social norms that might be changed over time (Lupovici 2016a).\nScholars suggest that, in addition to deterrence by punishment, actors also rely on tailored deterrence; serial and cumulative deterrence; deterrence by denial; deterrence by naming and shaming; deterrence through the development of international norms; and deterrence by detection. Scholars also note that actors could deter by punishment through the threat of using kinetic means, and not just through cyber means (Wheatley and Hayes 1996, 13, 19–20; Cordesman and Cordesman 2001, 7; Kugler 2009; Morgan 2010, 59, 68; Glaser 2011, 4; Stevens 2012; Tor 2017; Nye 2017; Lindsay and Gartzke 2018, 192; Schneider 2019a, 109; Wilner 2020, 253). They have also suggested that cyber deterrence is more likely to be effective against a potential cyberattack that is equivalent to armed conflict. This is because in such situations, the impact of the unique characteristics of cyberspace on deterrence will be less pronounced (Fischerkeller, Harknett, and Vičić 2020, 29).\nWhile debates continue, these scholars emphasize the theoretical questions—whether and when cyber deterrence may work—and offer policy implications. Nonetheless, less attention is given to methodological questions and challenges around studying these issues, and to how evidence should be collected and analyzed.\n For a review of this scholarship, see Nye (2017); Mandel (2017, 43–64); Wilner (2020, 251–56).\n Cooper (2012, 111–18) suggests the concept of *network deterrence*. He argues that the combination of means such as punishment, futility, and dependency could strengthen deterrence effectiveness when defenders and putative challengers share a network.\nA Methodology for Cyber Deterrence Research\n## The Impact of Problems in Studying Deterrence on the Research on Cyber Deterrence\n### The Dog That Did Not Bark\nLike other studies of deterrence, cyber deterrence scholarship is biased toward focusing on cases of deterrence failure. In fact, the limited access to data and the limited evidence available to scholars result in greater research bias. This is not necessarily a problem for specific studies that focus on a small number of prominent case studies. However, it is a challenge to the scholarship as a whole. As Valeriano and Maness observe, “[c]omparative case studies are rare, given the tendency to focus on events that might be outliers,” such as Estonia (2007), Stuxnet (2010), and Sony Hack (2014), leaving aside typical cyber interactions (Valeriano and Maness 2018, 260). These overlooked interactions may include cases of deterrence success.\nThe research, then, not only tends to examine cases of deterrence failure, but also focuses on a limited number of cases. Methodologically, it is not clear to what extent these cases represent the general “population” of cases of cyber deterrence. For example, the reason that led to the availability of the case for deterrence scholars may also have affected the deterrence outcome. Given the secrecy that surrounds many cyberattack incidents, known cases of deterrence failures may indicate situations in which resolute actors chose to challenge.\n### The Dog That Did Bark\nThis problem concerns how scholars interpret observations: the challenge of establishing whether a certain case is a deterrence failure or success and thus of establishing the causal mechanism of deterrence failure/success. The secrecy around cyber incidents and the limited information available to scholars exacerbate the challenges in deterrence research (see also Burton 2018, 6; Healey and Jenkins 2019, 125). These challenges include actors’ tendency to see themselves as the defender (and not the challenger) and the difficulty of developing a more nuanced classification of deterrence success/failure: one that is not dichotomic but acknowledges that deterrence failure and deterrence success are on a continuum. In a similar way, a significant challenge is to determine what constitutes deterrence failure. While in the kinetic domains, scholars, practitioners, and law experts have over many years developed an understanding of this, it is still debated in the cyber domain (e.g., Schmitt 2017). This further complicates the academic community’s ability to interpret deterrence failure and success, and to classify cases.\nThe challenge of identifying relevant cases not only creates selection bias, but also complicates the ability to determine the impact of the deterrent threat on the putative challenger’s behavior. This difficulty is shaped by the combination of the limitation of available information on cyberattacks and the characteristics of cyberattacks, which make the temporality of the attack a key issue. In kinetic domains, the timing of the attack and of the damage is similar; and in most cases, damage follows shortly after the attack’s execution. For example, it takes a few minutes for an intercontinental missile to hit its target, and damage will follow and start impacting the defender usually less than an hour after the initiation of the attack. Because of the various modes and stages of executing cyberattacks, on the other hand, scholars have to distinguish between the timing of the attack and the timing of the damage (e.g., Brantly and Smeets forthcoming, 4–5). Challengers can better control the timing of the attack. They can predetermine the attack or use the original attack as a platform for future attacks. This increased difficulty in identifying the deterrent threat’s timing and its influence on the putative challenger’s behavior makes study of it much more onerous. Furthermore, it raises a crucial question about the meaning of deterrence success: that is, whether executing an attack can be considered deterrence failure if the damage has yet to occur. All of this inhibits our ability to interpret deterrence success or to classify cases of deterrence failure and success.\nAMIR LUPOVICI\n\nUnlike the previous two clusters of challenges, this problem mainly affects the study of cyber deterrence. While the dog that did not bark emphasizes the problems stemming from being unable to observe cases of deterrence success, this problem emphasizes problems stemming from being unable to clearly observe cases of deterrence failure.\nIn other domains, the execution of an attack leaves traces and evidence that scholars can use. These traces help scholars to determine the case as deterrence failure, as well as to examine aspects related to the execution of the challenge: for example, the damage, how it was done, and by whom. In contrast, cyberattacks usually leave fewer traces. In fact, even a significant cyberattack may not be easily traced. For example, a cyberattack may target the electricity grid but be masked as an accident or a failure of the system (see also Schneider 2019a, 114). Furthermore, in some cases, the effectiveness of cyberattacks requires that they will remain untraced. In the well-known case of Stuxnet, the worm aimed not only to damage Iranian centrifuges, but also to confuse the Iranian scientists regarding the sources of the problem (Farwell and Rohozinski 2012, 115).\nWhile the research on cyber deterrence focuses on the problem of attribution—a situation in which the source of an attack is unknown—a key difficulty concerns a more fundamental challenge: the ability to detect that there was an attack in the first place. Brantly, for example, notes that in the cyber domain it is more important “to identify that an attack is occurring . . . than to in the moment identify who is actually conducting the attack” (Brantly 2016, 87). Moreover, regardless of whether or not the victim is aware of the attack, it is a challenge for scholars, who often have limited access to such information. For this reason, some scholars state their main focus is to study compelling success rather than deterrence success. Valeriano, Jensen, and Maness (2018, 24) suggest that “[o]ur choice to focus on compelling is driven by the need to examine the efficacy of operations that seek to achieve demonstrable effects. Compreciency is about changing behavior, while deterrence is about preventing behaviors, the latter being difficult to observe empirically.”\n# The Limitations of Current Solutions\nThe solutions put forward to address challenges in studying deterrence have advanced deterrence research, but they have encountered some difficulties. Applying them to cyber deterrence studies, that focus on exploring deterrence success/failure, creates additional problems, given the unique characteristics of cyber deterrence and how knowledge around cyber incidents and cyber deterrence is produced. While common solutions may become more effective in the future, as technology changes and reliable information on cyber incidents increases, they are currently quite limited.\nOne direction for a solution is to acquire data and conduct quantitative studies based on it. While a few scholars have started to use these methods to examine cyber deterrence success or closely related behavior with interesting findings (e.g., Brantly 2016; Pytlak and Mitchell 2016),[12] they have also pointed to challenges in using data to this end (e.g., Valeriano, Jensen, and Maness 2018, 24). Others also indicate the need to develop new ways to use data given the challenges of studying this strategy (Pytlak and Mitchell 2016, 79).\nBecause of the challenges of studying cyber deterrence, it is difficult to employ the solutions discussed above based on careful selection of specific case studies—that is, focusing on critical case studies and immediate deterrence and exploring\n[12] For example, Brantly’s (2016, 143–49) findings support the assertions that actors’ ability to maintain anonymity enhances the chances for deterrence failure. Nonetheless, Pytlak and Mitchell are unable to establish significant correlation and in the end reach inconclusive interpretations of the evidence (Pytlak and Mitchell 2016, 73–79).\nA Methodology for Cyber Deterrence Research\ncases of deterrence failure as well as of deterrence success. These solutions cannot fully resolve the challenges of determining cyber incidents and identifying and classifying situations of cyber deterrence failure and success. Jervis (1989, 194) has warned that explaining deterrence failure and success is more important than explaining their frequency; this caution is even more important in studying cyber deterrence given that the cases scholars are able to examine are more biased. The challenges of case selection stem not only from the dog that did not bark problem, but also from the dog that did bark and the dog that should have barked problems—biasing cases both of deterrence success and of deterrence failure.\nLikewise, focusing on cases of immediate deterrence also becomes a challenge when studying cyber deterrence, mainly because of the lack of available information and the characteristics of cyberattacks themselves. Scholars must distinguish the time of the attack, the time of its damage, the time the defender acknowledges the attack (and the damage), and the time the attack becomes public knowledge. The defender itself may be unaware that it needs to employ an immediate deterrence threat. For example, in contrast to other domains, preparations for attacks in the cyber domain leave less traces compared to preparations of kinetic attacks and thus complicate the ability of deterrer actors to pose an immediate deterrent threat. This means that examining cases of immediate deterrence is of limited help in studying cyber deterrence: actors have fewer opportunities to perform this strategy, the existence of known cases of immediate cyber deterrence may be biased, and, most importantly, scholars may not have access to full information on these cases.\nSolutions put forward to better establish the causal connection between the deterrent threat and the challenger behavior face similar challenges. Along with the problems discussed (case selection and identification of deterrence failure and success, which also limit establishing the \"explanation\") is the limited available information on the case studies. This makes additional potential solutions impractical, such as the relying on primary sources. Likewise, while studying enduring rivals could address some of the challenges around establishing causal connections (as well as eliminating biases in case selection), it is questionable whether such enduring rivals and conflicts in the cyber domain exist, or whether scholars can acquire enough relevant information about them to allow such research. Cyber deterrence scholars, therefore, experience significant challenges because of difficulties identifying cases of deterrence success or failure. While these problems accompany the study of deterrence in general—both quantitative and qualitative works—they are worse in the study of cyber deterrence and intensify other challenges. Under these conditions, researchers need to go back to the same case studies, in this way possibly missing other important factors affecting the practices of deterrence.\n## Toward a Methodology for Studying Cyber Deterrence\nThe challenges discussed above, and the limited applicability of current solutions to address them, increase the attractiveness of an alternative methodological solution to explore cyber deterrence. While, it is impossible to fully resolve all the challenges in the study of cyber deterrence, this article provides some directions toward this goal. I advance a solution based on studying the adoption of cyber deterrence strategy. By the adoption of cyber deterrence strategy, I refer to one of two things: (1) a strategic change, in which an actor moves toward a decision to rely on at least one type of cyber deterrence strategy (e.g., punishment, denial, detection),\nOn policy decisions to reveal or conceal experiencing cyberattacks, see Baram and Sommer (2019).\nGiven how difficult it is for the defender to identify the need to issue an immediate cyber deterrence threat, the fact that a defender successfully identifies this need may itself affect its ability to issue a successful deterrent threat. Whereas in other domains the putative challenger may also attempt to disguise its attempt to attack, defender actors have more means to identify it prior to the attack.\nAMIR LUPOVICI\n\nStudying the adoption of deterrence strategies has not been given enough scholarly attention. Indeed, my exploration of this phenomenon overlaps with various studies on different types of deterrence strategies (e.g., nuclear, conventional). Some scholars, as noted above, have even started to specifically study cyber deterrence adoption (Kugler 2009, 311–13; Stevens 2012; Adamsky 2018; Healey 2019; Gold 2020, 8–21; Wilner 2020). Nonetheless, few of these studies theorize this adoption, being more interested in the historical process through which deterrence was embraced. Furthermore, these scholars do not see research on adoption of the strategy as a methodological solution to challenges in studying deterrence.\nIn contrast, I suggest focusing on the adoption of deterrence strategy as a way to address the methodological challenges of studying (cyber) deterrence. Such a focus allows scholars to explore the various ways actors adopt this strategy and to apply different methods to ascertain this phenomenon and explain it. But before detailing the advantages of studying the adoption and employment of deterrence strategies, it is useful to categorize them. For example, the various ways actors adopt cyber deterrence strategies can be categorized based on the threat they aim to dissuade and their types, means, and degrees of explicitness.\n## The Undesired Activity to Be Deterred\nActors can use cyber deterrence to deter threats not only in the cyber domain but also in other domains. In the former, the strategy of cyber deterrence can be used to deter different types of cyber threats that vary in intensity, complexity, and feasibility (e.g., Brantly 2016, 116–17; Burton 2018, 28–29). Brantly, for example, distinguishes three main categories of activities actors attempt to deter: cyberattacks, cyber espionage, and cyber theft (Brantly 2020, 8–9). Defending actors may also develop a cross-domain deterrence strategy to dissuade threats conducted through cyber space that target supply chains or critical infrastructures or that may affect military activities and effectiveness (Schneider 2019a, 103, 108–9).\nOther categories of employing cyber deterrence strategy concern the use of cyber means to dissuade attacks in kinetic domains (Lupovici 2016a, 325). For example, cyber means may bolster conventional deterrence (Schneider 2019a, 115–19, but see Libicki 2016, 281). In a similar way, cyber means may affect nuclear deterrence. Some scholars estimate that advances in artificial intelligence may undermine nuclear deterrence (Lieber and Press 2017, 10; Horowitz 2019, 782; Johnson 2020, 429–38). However, others who study developments in Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA), including the advancement of autonomous machines and computerized devices, point to how in some situations these systems may enhance deterrence vis-à-vis different kinds of kinetic attacks (Fortmann and Von Hlatky 2009, 309–12).\nA related question about the type of threat is the specific phase of the cyberattack defenders wish to deter. Brantly and Smeets (forthcoming, 4–5) distinguish among different stages of cyberattack, such as the penetration of the defender’s system to\n Some scholars indirectly refer to the adoption of the strategy while studying “deterrence success” as part of operationalizing deterrence threat. For example, in defining the issuing of an immediate extended deterrent threat, Huth and Russett argue that scholars need to focus on “observable behavioral indicators in the form of statements and military actions that signal the threat to use force if the protégé is attacked.” According to them, even if this is a bluff, it is part of practicing deterrence (Huth and Russett 1990, 488). However, their goal of operationalizing the issuing of the deterrent threat is to establish covariance as part of explaining deterrence success.\n This type of approach is clearly evident in Freedman and Michaels’ (2019) seminal book on the evolution of nuclear strategies in different periods of time and in different countries.\n In addition, scholars refer to more specific challenges, such as deterring the use of information warfare through cyber platforms (Whyte 2020b, 237–39).\nA Methodology for Cyber Deterrence Research\ninstall the means of attack and the execution of the attack to actually generate the damage.\n## Types of Deterrent Strategies\nActors differ in what specific type of deterrent strategies, or combination of them, they adopt. Currently, in addition to deterrence by punishment, scholars tend to emphasize the following types of cyber deterrence strategies: tailored deterrence (Kugler 2009), punctuated/cumulative deterrence (Kello 2017; Tor 2017, 205–11), deterrence by denial (Iasiello 2013; Libicki 2016, 268–70; Nye 2017, 56–7), deterrence by detection or by accusation (Lindsay and Gartzke 2018, 192; Finnemore and Hollis 2020, 980–81), and deterrence by naming and shaming and through development of international norms (Nye 2017, 60–62; Stevens 2012; see also Libicki 2009, 68).\n## The Deterrent Means\nNot only can actors adopt different types of cyber deterrence strategies, but they can also employ each strategy with different means. For example, deterrence by punishment may be based not only on the defender’s cyber means, but also on its economic, diplomatic, and kinetic means (e.g., Kugler 2009, 328; Jasper 2017, 95–96; Schneider 2019a). In a similar way, actors can employ deterrence by denial not only by communicating their defensive means, but also by communicating their means to avoid the damage, such as by establishing backup systems to ensure the resilience of the information infrastructures (see also Nye 2017, 57).\n## Degree of Explicitness\nWhether and how actors publicly declare they will respond to a challenge is fundamental to understanding these practices in any domain of conflict (Brantly 2016, 113). Given the fact that communicating threats is a core element of deterrence strategy, the degree of explicitness is a key characteristic of how cyber deterrence strategy is adopted and employed. Deterrent threats are communicated through a wide spectrum of expressions—ranging from full explicitness to lack of any reference to the deterrent threat—that contain three main elements:\nOne element is how the threat is articulated and directed at an opponent: for example, whether the threat is generally stated in a strategic document (e.g., Department of Defense 2011) or the defender targets specific opponents (e.g., Department of Defense 2018, 1).\nA second element is how explicitly the undesired activity the defender wants to prevent is communicated. Scholars have debated over this issue when studying deterrence in other domains, contemplating whether a red line should be clearly stated or not (e.g., Lockhart 1978, 548–51; Schelling 1981, 38–41).\nA third element is the extent to which the deterrent threat itself is communicated. Actors differ in how explicitly they present the consequences that will stem from the challenger’s undesired activity: whether, for example, the defender specifies the retaliatory punishment or only presents it generally. A number of US documents have stated that the United States preserves the right to retaliate against a cyberattack with all the means they hold (Department of Defense 2011, 2; Department of Defense 2013, 32, 41–42; see also in Healey 2019; and in Wilner 2020). While some argue that actors can achieve a deterrent effect by specifying what a retaliatory strike will include (to a specific challenger) (e.g., Kugler 2009, 331–32), others suggest that states often issue a more general threat, using ambiguity as a mechanism of deterrence (e.g., Brantly 2016, 114). Conversely, actors may refrain from explicitly\nAMIR LUPOVICI\n\nOther possibilities exist between full explicitness and non-explicitness in communicating deterrent threats. Kugler (2009, 311–3), for example, reviews key US documents since 2003 and concludes that while they acknowledge the need to develop cyber deterrence strategy, they do not elaborate on how it can be attained. Likewise, actors, such as in the Israeli case, may discuss the need to adopt a strategy of cyber deterrence or wish to develop such a strategy but refrain from directly and explicitly issuing deterrent threats. In the last decade, senior Israeli policymakers have made the point that Israel should acquire a cyber deterrence strategy. For example, when serving as minister of defense, Ehud Barak suggested that in the uncertainty that cyber capabilities create, “leadership is required to show the way as to how to do the right thing for Israel and to establish a deterrent balance” (Barak 2012). Prime Minister Netanyahu also explained the need to develop a cyber deterrence strategy despite the fact that “[t]he ability to deter is more difficult because the source of such an attack is more anonymous. This is a problem we will certainly have to address” (Netanyahu 2011).\nInterestingly, in May 2020, it seems that Israel has moved to adopt an even more explicit cyber deterrence strategy when its retaliation against targets in Iran in response to a cyberattack on water infrastructures in Israel was reported (Warrick and Nakashima 2020). The publication of the Israeli retaliation, as well as other statements made by Israeli officials such as by Minister of Defense, Naftali Bennett, were interpreted as an attempt of Israel to send deterrent messages to the Iranians and to draw a red line (Siman Tov and Even 2020).\nSending deterrent messages through acts of retaliation is closely related to the concepts of punctuated deterrence and cumulative deterrence, where the actual use of force aims to punish and deliver a threatening message over a long period of time (Kello 2017, 205–11; Tor 2017). Even before the incidents of May 2020, some experts interpreted Israel’s offensive cyber capabilities in this context, claiming they aim in part to deter potential challengers and “show potential attackers what Israel is able to do if it chooses to respond to an attack” (Cohen, Freilich and Siboni 2016, 313).\nSome degree of explicitness—and thus communication and signaling—is a crucial aspect of these practices. According to Kello (2017, 209), “Diplomatic and signaling procedures will be required to demonstrate to adversaries that for the purpose of punishment, individual hostile actions are regarded as a comprehensive package of offensive activity rather than being disparate actions that merit isolated responses.” Likewise, as Tor (2017, 107) asserts, just the use of force is insufficient in creating a cumulative cyber deterrent strategy, as there is also a need to “to outline the ‘rules of the game’ in a clear way.”\n## Advantages in Focusing on Adoption of Cyber Deterrence Strategy\nFocusing on the adoption and employment of cyber deterrence has a number of theoretical and methodological advantages: it diversifies research by highlighting an overlooked phenomenon, it invites plural approaches and methods that help to better explain and understand actors’ behavior, and it thus emphasizes\n In this respect, comparing US documents reveals a growing specification of cyber deterrence strategies over the years (e.g., in Kugler 2009, 311–13).\n Examples of less explicit messages that serve deterrent goals can be found in leaking of information around cyberattacks—such as Stuxnet, the corruption of Syria’s air defense system, the Chinese penetration of American health insurer files, and the Russian hack into the US Democratic Party files (Perkovich and Levite 2017, 273; see also Mazanec and Thayer 2014, 69).\nA Methodology for Cyber Deterrence Research\nthe importance of various strategic, normative, and cultural aspects related to this phenomenon. While to some extent these advantages could also be achieved by diverting the study around cyber deterrence failure/success to these directions, the main advantage lies in the observability that studying the adoption of the strategy allows. Not only does this advantage stand by its own in improving our understanding of the practices of cyber deterrence, but it also enhances the other advantages: diversification of the research and the use of plural methods.\n## Observability\nThe main advantage of studying the adoption and employment of deterrence strategy is the ability to trace empirical evidence of it. The idea behind a strategy of deterrence, as discussed above, is to issue and communicate threats. The communication can be more or less explicit—and can even be a bluff; however, it is a crucial part of practicing this strategy.\nEven if the deterrent threat is a bluff, the methodological solution based on studying the adoption and employment of (cyber) deterrent strategy cannot be dismissed based on an assertion that issuing deterrent threats is cheap talk. Given the cult of reputation and practitioners' worry about resolve (e.g., Tang 2005; Kertzer 2016), a defender may find it costly to not execute the deterrent threat or retaliate in case the undesired attack has been made by the putative challenger. They may fear that other actors will challenge them in the future because of the alleged demonstration of weakness. Actors thus are likely to take the adoption of cyber deterrence strategy and the issuing of deterrent threat seriously; issuing deterrent threats, therefore, provides indications of an actor's strategy.\nFocusing on observable indications allows scholars to address challenges in the study of cyber deterrence that stem from limited access to details around practicing cyber deterrence that in many cases remain unknown, such as the attack, the damage, and when the defender identified it was attacked. First, the problem of the dog that did not bark and the problem of the dog that should have barked become less pressing. Focusing on strategy adoption and the issuing of deterrent threat involves observing changes in the behavior of the defender actor. From this perspective, and as further discussed below, scholars can study nuances in strategy adoption, conduct comparisons among actors and over time, and explain this phenomenon regardless of the putative challenger's behavior or of the deterrence strategy outcomes. In other words, the research will not be biased toward studying specific cases of deterrence failure.\nStudying cyber deterrence strategy adoption also addresses challenges around the dog that did bark problem. By focusing mainly on the behavior of the defender actor, scholars have much less difficulty in interpretation, as the outcome to be examined and explained is less ambiguous. Indeed, scholars may debate over whether an actor actually adopted a cyber deterrence strategy, how it differs from its previous strategies, and about its specific elements. However, because adopting and employing a strategy of deterrence requires some degree of explicitness—unlike deterrence successes and even cyber deterrence failures—scholars also have much more access to empirical evidence to discuss and dispute.\n Likewise, as Libicki (2016, 227) and Tor (2017, 107) note actors may deliver their deterrent messages not only in public channels but also in secret ones. While for scholars the delivering of deterrent messages secretly poses difficulties of observing and studying the occurrences, actors have incentives to make some public manifestations of the deterrent threat they issue, even indirectly, in order to target larger audiences. In addition, the focus of the suggested methodology is on the strategy, and not necessarily on the communication of a specific threat to a certain opponent. For example, in theory, a cyber deterrence strategy may be adopted explicitly, but the explicit strategic document may also acknowledge that in some situations the communication of the deterrent threat will be delivered privately.\n For further discussion of costly signals, cheap talk, and deterrence, see Fearon (2002, 13–16), Lupton (2018, 64), but also see Danilovic (2002, 130–40).\nIn addition, studying cyber deterrence strategy adoption makes more effective use of the methodological solutions traditional deterrence scholars offer to the challenges of exploring this strategy. First, scholars have pointed in different ways to the need to selectively choose case studies, such as studying critical cases of deterrence failure, or studying enduring rivals. While the main solution this article offers is somewhat different—focusing on the adoption/employment of the strategy—in fact, these solutions complement each other: for example, exploring the adoption, changes, and abandoning of cyber deterrence strategies over time between enduring rivals.\nOther solutions have aimed to better establish the causal mechanism (of deterrence success). Because of the observability of both cyber deterrence adoption and the elements that may account for it, the solution of developing specific hypotheses about the defender, the challenger, and the situation is useful direction to take. Scholars can observe the characteristics of cyber deterrence strategy adoption (e.g. explicitness, timing, the type of the cyber deterrence, the means to establish it, and the kind of challenge it aims to dissuade). In a similar way, scholars can provide various factors affecting such adoption, including elements of perceptions, culture, and norms on the one hand, and the strategic utility of the strategy on the other. Likewise, as further discussed below, they may explore the social context in which the strategy is embedded.\nFocusing on the adoption of the strategy is closely related to another solution advised by traditional deterrence scholars—that is, to rely on primary sources. Strategy adoption, being observable, provides sources to empirically establish the study of cyber deterrence. However, focusing on adoption also opens up other types of sources. Strategic documents establish the employment of the strategy, such as the US Department of Defense Cyberspace Policy Report, Department of Defense Defense Science Board, and the Department of Defense Cyber Strategy. Other relevant sources help to understand and explain how actors adopt cyber deterrence strategy, in this way exploring the various elements presented above. For example, primary documents that trace how perceptions on cyber (domain) change over time and how the cyber (domain) is constructed (e.g. in Raymond 2019, 203--35) could provide an account of changes in actors' willingness to employ this strategy in the cyber domain.\nThe methodological solution I propose—focusing on the adoption and employment of the strategy rather on deterrence success—provides important indications of actors' perceptions of the strategy's effectiveness. Scholars can explore specific cases and conduct longitudinal and cross-sectional comparisons of actors who adopt (or refrain from adopting) cyber deterrence strategy. For example, a growing international tendency to rely on this strategy may imply increasing effectiveness of the strategy or at least an increase in the perception of its effectiveness. Indeed, there are different explanations as to why actors adopt and employ a strategy of (cyber) deterrence—and these should be explored. Nonetheless, given the limited access to information about deterrence success, solutions based on focusing on the strategy's adoption provide important alternatives.\nTechnological developments provide one explanation (or hypothesis) for the adoption of cyber deterrence strategy. For example, given the problem of attribution, technologies that help defenders trace the source of an attack may enhance this strategy's efficiency and hence its attractiveness. In a similar way, improvements in defensive measures, measures to increase resilience, and organization skills in operating these measures (Slayton 2017, 89--90, e.g. Matania and Tal-Shir 2020) may make strategies of deterrence by denial more attractive. While these are plausible hypotheses, we cannot reduce the adoption of (cyber) deterrence strategies to technological advancement. Other explanations could be developed, for example,\nA Methodology for Cyber Deterrence Research\nbased on actors' (strategic) culture (e.g., Knopf 2013, 9–10). A number of reviews of cyber security policies and strategies of different countries (e.g., Luijjf, Besseling, Spoelstra, and De Graaf 2013; Liveri and Sarri 2014; Baezner and Cordey 2019) provide not only the social context of cyber deterrence strategies, but also information to help explain their adoption (or lack thereof). The strategic, political, and cultural elements these reports review are useful points of departure toward that goal.\nInternational norms could also affect the adoption of cyber deterrence strategy. Nye, for example, suggests that deterrence through the establishment of international norms is one means of employing cyber deterrence. This strategy is based on creating taboos that increase the costs of attacking certain cyber targets (e.g., civilian cyber infrastructures) (Nye 20167, 60–62). From this perspective, the emergence of norms incentivizes actors to rely on practices of deterrence and adopt and employ them. Furthermore, the emergence of new norms can also affect other types of deterrence strategy, including deterrence by punishment. Actors may be more motivated to adopt such a strategy, for example, if cyberattacks are constructed as acts of violence. Seeing a challenge as “violent” increases an actor’s willingness to employ threats to dissuade it, thus enhancing deterrence effectiveness. The existence of a norm that portrays cyberattacks in this way legitimizes a retaliatory strike and thus the adoption of this strategy in the first place (Lupovici 2016a, 333–34). In recent years, scholars have begun to explore how public perceptions of cyber conflicts and dynamics affect support for retaliation against cyberattacks (Kreps and Schneider 2019; Shandler, Gross, and Canetti 2021). Public attitudes open up a broad area for research connecting normative, political, and institutional factors that also affect the adoption of cyber deterrence strategies.\n## Diversifying Cyber Deterrence Research\nBy focusing on the strategy’s adoption, we can examine and compare various kinds of actors, especially actors other than those commonly examined. In particular, the United States is overrepresented in the research. There are a number of reasons for this—including that many scholars are American and aim to influence the US strategy, that the United States is considered a cyber power, and the greater availability of American documents. Therefore, US cyber deterrence will probably continue to be closely examined.\nHowever, the observability of the adoption and employment of the strategy makes information on other cases also relatively accessible, which may help to fill the gap and advance our understanding of other countries. One of the research puzzles concerns actors who have not adopted an explicit cyber deterrence strategy—Israel being a key example. Despite the fact that deterrence is a strategy Israel has adopted vis-à-vis various threats (Lupovici 2016b), so far Israel has refrained from issuing direct cyber deterrent threats.\nDiversifying the research to include other states is also intriguing given the differing views on the strategy of deterrence and cyber security. Studying whether and how these actors adopt and employ cyber deterrence strategies helps to develop a more nuanced understanding of what cyber deterrence is and why and how it is used.\nWe can also extend the study of cyber deterrence to explore non-state actors. In recent years, deterrence scholarship has started to acknowledge other actors involved in the practices of deterrence (Paul, Morgan, and Wirtz 2009). Scholars have explored not only how states attempt to deter non-states threats (e.g., Wilner 2015, 37–74), but also how different kinds of non-state actors, such as terrorist\nI discuss below some more specific cultural explanations for adopting a strategy of deterrence.\nFor further discussion on the question of “violence,” use of force, cyberattacks, and legitimate retaliation, see Waxman (2011), Harrison Dinniss (2012, 63–75), Schmitt (2017, chapter 14, 16), and Schneider (2019a, 115).\nAMIR LUPOVICI\n\n## Inviting Plural Research Methods\nThe study of the adoption and employment of cyber deterrence strategies invites positivist and interpretative methods. Positivist scholars can study causal mechanisms of this phenomenon through quantitative and qualitative methods. Scholars can focus on specific case studies or conduct longitudinal and cross-sectional comparative works on actors who adopted, were late to adopt, or did not adopt cyber deterrence strategy.\nFocusing on adoption is a promising direction for examining whether, how, and why an actor adopts and employs a certain type of cyber deterrence strategy. One option is to explore the evolution of the strategy: for example, by tracing a shift in a state’s cyber strategy. The changes in 2018 in US cyber policy provide a useful demonstration of these dynamics, illustrating the advantages of the suggested framework. In 2018, the United States adopted a cyber strategy based on *defend forward* and *persistent engagement* (e.g., compare Department of Defense 2011 with Department of Defense 2018; see also Healey 2019; Kosseff 2019, 5; Wilner 2020, 266–67). While there is debate over how far this strategy diverts from an emphasis on deterrence, experts ascribe the shift to the limited applicability of deterrence strategy in the cyber domain (e.g., Fischerkeller and Harknett 2017; see also King and Gallagher 2020, 27–28).\nThis policy change led to some interesting questions. Foremost, the timing of this shift is worth exploring. Doubts over the effectiveness of cyber deterrence strategy were expressed as early as the 1990s. This implies that the 2018 change was informed by notions beyond those of the limitations of cyber deterrence strategy—for example, by the acknowledgment that adversaries in cyber space are in constant contact (e.g., Fischerkeller and Harknet 2017; Fischerkeller, Harknett, and Vičić 2020, 25–30). This shows that acceptance of new ideas and their successful promotion by individuals and networks may also be crucial in accounting for this change. Healey suggests that the change “stems directly from this Goldman–Fischerkeller–Harknett lineage (and subsequently drove the DoD Cyber Strategy and parts of the White House National Cyber Strategy). This is perhaps unsurprising “as all three are international relations scholars who have worked at US Cyber Command” (Healey 2019, 5). Processes of learning, persuasion, and individual characteristics can all help to explain whether and how cyber deterrence strategy is shifting, accepted, and employed.\nLearning may be also seen as a result of cyberattacks experienced by the United States, which led practitioners to emphasize the need to shift to persistent engagement. Whyte (2020a, 210–11) summarizes this point: “[N]umerous commentators . . . note the significance of Russian political warfare in 2016 as a realisation mo\n Likewise, Libicki concludes that the United States should not make cyber deterrence an explicit strategy and that it should not rely on it (Libicki 2016, 266).\n For similar dynamics regarding learning nuclear deterrence, see Kaplan (1991), Adler (1992), and Evangelista (1999). These studies show, in different ways, that although technological developments are crucial, they are insufficient to account for the adoption of deterrence strategies.\nA Methodology for Cyber Deterrence Research\nment prompting the development of the new, more assertive strategy.” Structural changes also allowed for and guided this shift. For example, comparing the 2018 cyber strategy with its predecessor (DoD 2015), Kollars and Schneider (2018) note “The 2018 Cyber Strategy reflects the changes in the political, technical, and institutional environment over the last three years.”\nAnother research direction that focuses on the adoption of the strategy could examine the exact nature, rather the efficiency, of the strategy: that is, examining whether and which type of deterrence strategy the new adopted policy aims to advance. Scholars have debated over whether the 2018 strategy emphasizes deterrence strategy (see, Healey 2019, 3–4). On the one hand, it was developed and justified based on the limits of cyber deterrence as discussed above. For example, Kreps and Schneider (2019, 9) assert that persistent engagement is better suited than deterrence. According to them, “[D]eterrence hinges on public resolve for overwhelming uses of force and a willingness to escalate, which appears lacking in the cyber domain, whereas persistent engagement can operate at a lower intensity of confrontation—albeit one that is relatively continuous—that gains legitimacy by virtue of the public support.”\nNonetheless, while experts acknowledge the shift in the US strategy, they also point to different types of deterrence strategy that the new policy emphasizes and to how it might actually enhance the US deterrent posture. For Whyte (2020a, 210), the new strategy marks a shift from deterrence by denial to a kind of deterrence by punishment. Likewise, Kollars and Schneider (2018) identify a specific shift in US strategy toward tailored deterrence against China and Russia, compared with a former comprehensive cyber deterrence strategy vis-à-vis a “wide array of actors and actions.” Furthermore, persistent engagement based on offensive action might strengthen deterrence strategy by signaling resolve and establishing escalation dominance (Kollars and Schneider 2018; Miller and Pollard 2019; Valeriano and Jensen 2019). In a similar way, the US Cyber Command Vision statement implements the idea of persistent engagement as a way to enhance the US deterrent posture. According to this document, “Through persistent action and competing more effectively below the level of armed conflict, we can influence the calculations of our adversaries, deter aggression, and clarify the distinction between acceptable and unacceptable behavior in cyberspace” (USCYBERCOM 2018, 6).\nThese discussions demonstrate not only the importance of looking into a cyber (deterrence) strategy, explaining it, and analyzing its components, but also the feasibility of conducting such research. Although, scholars can interpret the evidence differently, and the meaning and implications of the strategy may change over time, there is accessible and important evidence to work with. Furthermore, it helps to demonstrate how the suggested methodology provides an alternative to the challenges of studying deterrence success. While we still have little information about the outcomes of this strategy, we can start by considering the various aspects of its adoption.\nIn addition to focusing on one case study or on shifts in actors’ cyber deterrence strategy, such as the those discussed above (the case of Israel response in May 2020 and the 2018 US policy), scholars can also conduct broader comparisons. These can explore the reasons for the differences in how countries adopt and employ cyber deterrence strategies or compare an actor’s adoption and employment of cyber deterrence strategy with its adoption and employment of deterrence strategy\n The idea of persistent engagement sparked a debate over whether and to what extent cyber operations are effective in attaining strategic goals, and specifically whether and how they contribute to cyber deterrence success. While scholars acknowledged a number of advantages of the new policy, they were also worried that the criteria for success of this new strategy are not entirely clear; that employing it might be too costly; that it might lead to escalation; and that it may deteriorate US relationships with its allies (Healey 2019, 7–11; Lin and Smeets 2019; Miller and Pollard 2019; Smeets 2019a; Schneider 2019b; Smeets 2019b; Valeriano and Jensen 2019).\nAMIR LUPOVICI\n\nAn obvious advantage here is the access to comparable information and data. Scholars, thus, not only can conduct quantitative research that explores different aspects of the adoption of cyber deterrence strategies, but can also use data sets already available. This direction accords with Pytlak and Mitchell’s (2016, 79) recommendation to develop new techniques to address and use data in a way that overcomes the limited “amount of information publicly available.”\nBased on the data collected and analyzed by Brantly (2016), Valeriano, Jensen, and Maness (2018), and Kostyuk and Zhukov (2019), scholars are able to develop interesting notions about the adoption of deterrence strategy. For example, following these studies, it is possible to ask whether actors who absorbed significant cyberattacks tend to consider adopting cyber deterrence strategies to balance their insecurities, or whether more powerful actors tend to rely on this strategy, for example, based on long-term deterrence through previous execution of cyber means (i.e., cumulative cyber deterrence). These notions fit some of the assertions Valeriano et al. make, such as those about credibility and signaling (Valeriano, Jensen, and Maness 2018, 46–47), as well as about the long-term aims of cyber operations (Valeriano, Jensen, and Maness 2018, 11). Similarly, the cyber power score Brantly (2016, 138–40, 169) develops enables some hypotheses about the adoption of cyber deterrence strategies: for example, whether weaker states tend to adopt deterrence strategies to balance their inferiority (e.g., explicitly adopt the strategy) or to avoid it, fearing that adopting it will contribute to escalation. Based on these data, scholars can also compare whether and why different actors adopt different types of cyber deterrence strategies: for example, whether weaker actors rely on strategies such as deterrence by naming and shaming or deterrence by detection.\nThe suggested methodology based on studying the adoption of the strategy not only enables positivistic studies, but may also fit well with interpretative frameworks and research on deterrence. Interpretative scholars who study deterrence have started to employ discourse analysis to examine the practices of deterrence (Cohn 1987; Luke 1989; Dauber 1993; Harrington 2016; Vuori 2016). While these methods have not been fully applied to study cyber deterrence, this could be done through focusing on the adoption and employment of the strategy and on the language used. One specific promising direction is to study the adoption and employment of deterrence as securitizing moves (Lupovici 2019). Scholars have started to explore different securitizing moves related to cyber (Bendrath, Eriksson, and Giacomello 2007; Dunn Cavelty 2008; Hansen and Nissenbaum 2009; Deibert and Rohozinski 2010; Dunn Cavelty 2013; Stevens 2016). Looking into the adoption of cyber deterrence strategy provides intriguing cases to further apply the theory of securitization to traditional security challenges. This direction may cover various securitizing moves: for example, the American attempt to securitize cyber challenges to justify various means of retaliation, including even nuclear weapons, in the case of an “existential cyber attack” (Department of Defense 2013, 42; see also Wilner 2020, 261).\nIn a similar way, interpretative approaches highlight the importance of the social context in which deterrence strategy is embedded. These notions can be also ap-\n One goal of comparing cyber deterrence with deterrence in other domains is to validate the assertion that the adoption of cyber deterrence may indicate, even indirectly, deterrence success, as discussed above.\n Likewise, reports that document cyber incidents may also prove useful in tracing previous cyber operations and their influence on actors’ adoption of cyber deterrence strategies; see, for example, the project of the Council on Foreign Relations at https://www.cfr.org/cyber-operations.\nA Methodology for Cyber Deterrence Research\nplied to study cyber deterrence: for example, in examining how the strategy's adoption and employment are shaped by international norms, (strategic) culture, and actors' identity. This is important to better understand how and why actors adopt cyber deterrence strategies, but also because the way the strategy is adopted indicates and reflects political, normative, and cultural elements. Although scholars have not used these elements to study cyber deterrence adoption (but see Adamsky 2018), they have explained deterrence strategy adoption and employment in other domains by pointing to strategic culture (Basrur 2006, 49–79; Adamsky 2017, 166–71), norms (Tannenwald 2007, 45, 291–92), practices (Adler and Pouliot 2011, 9–15, 21–28), rituals (Mälksoo 2021), and actors' identity, emotions, and ontological security (Tannenwald 2007, 45–46; Lupovici 2016b). The adoption and employment of cyber deterrence strategy provide another arena to examine and employ these theories.\n# Conclusions\nThis article suggests that focusing on the adoption and employment of cyber deterrence strategy—rather than studying cyber deterrence success—promises to provide solutions to the methodological challenges associated with the study of this strategy. This article does not claim to advance the only way to explore cyber deterrence. On the contrary, scholars may well find methodological alternatives, as there is still need to collect and analyze data and case studies on deterrence failure/success. Nonetheless, based on clarifying methodological challenges and by offering a categorization of different characteristics of how (cyber) deterrence strategies are adopted, I point to a phenomenon that has received insufficient attention, and studying it carries a number of advantages. Among other things, it provides methodological solutions, it helps diversify the research of deterrence, and it invites plural approaches and methods. This paper thus should be seen as a point of departure for further research and as a call to focus on the adoption and employment of the strategy.\nMore generally, I suggest that elaborating on these issues contributes not only to the study of cyber deterrence, but also to the two fields of research: deterrence and cyber. For the former, the advantage lies in reframing methodological problems and challenges that may be relevant for scholars who explore not only cyber deterrence. Another advantage for deterrence research, in general, lies in studying an understudied phenomenon. More scholarly work has been done on the adoption and employment of deterrence strategies (mainly of nuclear deterrence, e.g., Kaplan 1991; Adler 1992; Evangelista 1999; Freedman and Michaels 2019) than on the adoption of cyber deterrence strategies. Nonetheless, while the study of deterrence strategy adoption lags behind the study of deterrence success, it may well complement it. From this perspective, this article provides a first step in developing a methodology to study the adoption and employment of different types of deterrence strategies in different domains and with different deterrent means.\nThis is, furthermore, an important phenomenon on its own. It may indicate various aspects about actors' strategic thinking, perceptions, culture, and identity. Understanding how, when, and why actors adopt and employ deterrence strategies (or change or abandon them) in various domains may also further the study of cyber deterrence adoption and employment. The study of more traditional strategies of deterrence may reveal additional explanations and possible characteristics to examine, explain, and compare. Conversely, studying the adoption of cyber deterrence may advance the study of more traditional strategies of deterrence. Most notably, studying cyber deterrence emphasizes that adoption of deterrence strategies cannot be taken as given but requires explanation. It also reveals our assumptions in studying deterrence. For example, traditional studies of deterrence take as given that the challenge is an act of violence or that the timing of the attack and the tim\nAMIR LUPOVICI\n\nRegarding cyber studies, exploring the strategy's adoption may account for changes in actors' behavior. In other words, studying cyber deterrence adoption demonstrates how technological and normative changes affect cyber strategies. In a similar way, we can study how culture, on the one hand, and rational calculations, on the other hand, affect behavior in the cyber domain. Studying cyber deterrence adoption makes cyber behavior more observable. Therefore, we can draw implications from it that go beyond those related solely to deterrence.\n## Acknowledgments\nI would like to thank Patricia Greve, Gallia Lindenstrauss, and the three anonymous reviewers for their extremely helpful comments and suggestions on different drafts of this manuscript.

Studying cyber deterrence presents even greater challenges, as traditional deterrence challenges are exacerbated and interactions in the cyber domain create further difficulties. When studying cyber deterrence, scholars face uncertainty not only in identifying situations of deterrence success, but also—due to the secrecy surrounding cyber practices—in identifying situations of deterrence failure. Despite the many studies on cyber deterrence, methodological solutions to address these challenges still need to be developed. To this end, I suggest focusing on the adoption and employment of the strategy rather than on its success. I argue that since communicating threats is a core element of deterrence, it is easier to observe how the strategy is adopted and employed than whether it succeeds or fails. This focus provides a promising direction to study cyber deterrence and address these challenges.\nEl estudio de disuasión presenta una serie de desafíos, principalmente relacionados con la identificación de casos de éxito de disuasión y la definición de su funcionamiento. El estudio de la ciberdisuasión presenta desafíos aún mayores, ya que los desafíos tradicionales de la disuasión se ven exacerbados y las interacciones en el ámbito cibernético generan más dificultades. Al estudiar la ciberdisuasión, los académicos se enfrentan a la incertidumbre no solo a la hora de identificar situaciones de éxito de disuasión, sino también a la hora de identificar situaciones de fracaso de disuasión debido a la confidencialidad que gira en torno a las prácticas cibernéticas. A pesar de los numerosos estudios sobre la ciberdisuasión, todavía es necesario desarrollar soluciones metodológicas para abordar estos desafíos. Para lograrlo, sugiero enfocarse en la adopción e implementación de la estrategia más que en su éxito. Sostengo que, dado que comunicar amenazas es un elemento clave de la disuasión, es más fácil observar cómo se adopta e implementa la estrategia que identificar si tiene éxito o fracasa. Este enfoque marca un rumbo prometedor para estudiar la ciberdisuasión y abordar estos desafíos.\nL'étude de la dissuasion présente un certain nombre de défis qui sont principalement liés à l'identification de la réussite de la dissuasion et à la définition de la manière dont la dissuasion fonctionne.

Lorsqu'ils étudient la cyber-dissuasion, les chercheurs sont confrontés à de l'incertitude, non seulement dans l'identification des situations de réussite de la dissuasion, mais aussi—en raison du secret entourant les cyber-pratiques—dans l'identification de celles de son échec. Malgré les nombreuses études portant sur la cyber-dissuasion, des solutions méthodologiques doivent encore être développées pour aborder ces défis. À cette fin, je suggère une concentration sur l'adoption et l'emploi de la stratégie plutôt que sur son succès. Je soutiens qu'étant donné que la communication des menaces est un élément fondamental de la dissuasion, il est plus facile d'observer la façon dont la stratégie est adoptée et employée que d'observer si elle réussit ou échoue. Cette approche offre une orientation prometteuse pour étudier la cyber-dissuasion et aborder ces défis.\nKeywords: cyber, deterrence, methodology\nPalabras clave: cibernética, disuasión, metodología\nMots clés: cyber, dissuasion, méthodologie\n# Introduction\nResearch on cyber deterrence is rich and developing quickly. While scholars have pointed to the challenges of practicing cyber deterrence, their focus—like that of most deterrence scholars—has been on deterrence success. Most studies assess whether and how deterrence by punishment can be applied to the cyber domain (e.g., in Wilner 2020, 252–54), or whether and how it should be replaced with other strategies or types of deterrence, such as deterrence by denial (Iasiello 2013), or by cumulative deterrence (Tor 2017). These studies are part of the tendency Stevens (2016, 24) observes of cyber security studies to be “commonly oriented towards policy concerns.” Nonetheless, less attention is given to methodological challenges around studying cyber deterrence. This article aims to advance the methodology of studying (cyber) deterrence by offering a categorization of the methodological challenges concerning studying deterrence and by offering an alternative way to explore this strategy.\nInspired by the dog that did not bark problem—a bias in the study of deterrence toward cases of deterrence failure (Sauer 2016, 49)—I categorize three clusters of problems regarding the study of deterrence. Besides the dog that did not bark problem, I group additional challenges into two clusters of problems that I term the dog that did bark and the dog that should have barked problems. The former refers to challenges around interpreting cases of deterrence success and failure, and the latter to a bias that stems from the difficulty of identifying attacks and therefore seeing them as deterrence failures.\nBased on this categorization, I review and illustrate the challenges in studying cyber deterrence and the limited applicability of the current solutions offered to address them. These challenges include identifying deterrence success, selecting appropriate cases, and establishing causal connections between issuing the deterrent threat and deterrence success. While these problems generally characterize the study of deterrence, they are exacerbated in studying cyber deterrence, mainly because we cannot observe cyber deterrence successes and failures.\nI claim that one way to solve the challenges in studying cyber deterrence strategy is to shift focus from deterrence success to its adoption and employment. While this is\n¹Studying the adoption of cyber deterrence strategies overlaps with broader attempts to explore the motivation behind cyber strategies (e.g., Valeriano, Jensen, and Maness 2018; Gomez 2021).\nA Methodology for Cyber Deterrence Research\nnot the only solution—and indeed scholars still need to study deterrence success—I assert it provides a useful point of departure for thinking about and exploring this strategy.\nA number of scholars have begun to study the adoption of cyber deterrence strategies with illuminating insights (Kugler 2009, 311–13; Stevens 2012; Adamsky 2018; Healey 2019; Gold 2020, 8–21; Wilner 2020). While I rely on this scholarship, I also aim to advance it. The main goal for most of these works is to describe the evolution of the strategy rather than to explain the phenomenon of adopting the strategy. I suggest that using the adoption and employment of the strategy as the explained phenomenon (i.e., *explanandum*) is a promising method because of the observability of these aspects of the strategy. Communicating threats is a core element of a deterrence strategy, which makes the strategy’s adoption and employment much more explicit than its success or failure. This allows me to offer a categorization of how actors diverge in adopting and applying deterrence strategies, based on the goal, type, means, and explicitness of the strategy. This in turn provides a useful framework to study deterrence, and especially cyber deterrence strategies. Furthermore, as I demonstrate below, the study of the adoption and employment of cyber deterrence strategies encourages methodological pluralism, open to both positivist and interpretative methods.\nThe article proceeds as follows: In the first section, I discuss the main problems in the study of deterrence and the main solutions scholars offer to address them. In the second part, I specify the increased pressure of these challenges when studying cyber deterrence and argue that most solutions are not sufficient to remedy the problems. The third section develops a methodology for studying cyber deterrence, based on different characteristics that concern the adoption of the strategy. The fourth section shows and illustrates the promise of focusing on the adoption and employment of cyber deterrence to address the challenges. Such focus provides new research questions, explanations, and hypotheses, and diversifies the research of this strategy. I conclude by discussing the implications of this study on deterrence research in general and on cyber security research.\n## Methodological Challenges in Studying Deterrence\nScholars studying deterrence have paid a great deal of attention to methodological issues.³ While it is beyond this paper’s scope to discuss all the methodological challenges in the study of deterrence, I group the main challenges into three clusters. The first is based on what scholars refer to as the dog that did not bark problem. Building on this, I introduce two further problems: the dog that did bark and the dog that should have barked (see table 1).\n## The Dog That Did Not Bark\nThe dog that did not bark problem revolves around selection bias in studying cases of deterrence failure. Scholars are referring to Sherlock Holmes’ ability to solve a murder mystery based on the fact that a dog, present at the night of the murder, did not bark. Key to solving the case is the idea that there is meaning in the fact that something did not happen. The dog did not bark because the dog knew the perpetrator (see also Sauer 2016, 49). Based on this analogy, scholars have pointed to the flawed tendency to focus only on cases of deterrence failure, which provide\n³For reviews and comparisons of cyber strategies of different countries, see Thomas (2009), Lewis and Neuneck (2013), Luiijf, Besseling, Spoelstra, and De Graaf (2013), Liveri and Sarri (2014), and Baezner and Cordey (2019). See also King and Gallagher (2020, 144–45).\n³The debates over how to study deterrence, advanced not only research on deterrence and security, but also, and more broadly, studies in international relations (IR) and political science (e.g., see in King, Keohane, and Verba 1994, 24,134–35).\nAMIR LUPOVICI\n1675\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/isr/article/23/4/1672/6329772 by KIM Hohenheim user on 19 February 2024\nTable 1. Clusters of methodological challenges in the study of deterrence and cyber deterrence\n|  The problem | Description | Implications for the study of deterrence | Implications for the study of cyber deterrence  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  The dog that did not bark | The fact that the dog did not bark during a murder means something. In other words, it is important to analyze events that did not happen. | Scholars need to study not only cases of deterrence failure, but also cases of deterrence success (where allegedly nothing happens). However, the research suffers from a selection bias. Given the difficulties of studying cases of deterrence success, scholars tend to focus on studying cases of deterrence failure. | The selection bias is more challenging. Given the secrecy that surrounds interactions in the cyber domain, identifying cases of deterrence success is much more difficult, which further biases the study toward studying cases of deterrence failure.  |\n|  The dog that did bark | Interpreting events is very difficult. Dog’s barking does not necessarily mean that there was a murder, and vice versa (if the dog did not bark it does not mean that there was no murder). | Not only is the line between deterrence failure and success not clear-cut, but interpreting whether deterrence succeeded or failed based on the level of violence is problematic. Eruption of violence is not proof of deterrence failure, as lack of violence is not proof of deterrence success. | Interpreting events and concluding deterrence failure and success from observations is even more challenging given the secrecy surrounding cyber incidents and the ambiguity concerning what should be considered as violent attack (which constitute deterrence failure). Therefore, scholars face difficulties in classifying cases and in establishing (causal) explanations.  |\n|  The dog that should have barked | When the dog is not fully aware of the presence of a suspicious person, and therefore is not barking (e.g., in case of a murder, the dog is failing to notice or is noticing too late). | This challenge poses another sort of case selection bias, as obviously scholars are only able to study the cases they are aware of. | Scholars are not only biased toward studying cases of deterrence failure as indicated by the traditional challenge of studying deterrence. In cases of cyber deterrence, scholars are also not fully aware of cases of deterrence failure. This biases the research in different ways, including scholars’ tendency to focus on a limited number of known case studies of cyber deterrence failure for which relatively more information is available.  |\nA Methodology for Cyber Deterrence Research\nconsiderable observable traces to follow—the employment of violence by at least one of the parties (Achen and Snidal 1989, 161; Lebow and Stein 1990, 336, 347; King, Keohane, and Verba 1994, 24). Positivist scholars use this analogy to challenge scholars' ability to provide a full coloration given that they focus on one possible value of the examined variable of deterrence success—that is, deterrence failure. Some scholars have even suggested the problem is deeper, since focusing on deterrence failures leads to exploration of much more resolute actors—those “who select themselves into crises” and therefore are less likely to be deterred (Danilovic 2002, 117–19; Fearon 2002, 6, 14; see also Wilner 2015, 190, footnote 4, p. 241).\nWhile the problematic tendency to focus on cases of deterrence failure clearly exists, it should be noted that lack of violence is not a nonoccurrence. As Tannenwald, emphasizes, \"[T]here is no such thing as explaining a non-event . . . What is actually being explained is a contrast between an actual event and a possible alternative counterfactual event.\" What we are in fact asking is not why the dog did not bark, but why the dog was silent, as we have a reasonable expectation that in such situations the counterfactual (e.g., barking) is a likely scenario (Tannenwald 2007, 30). From this perspective, when deterrence succeeds (and there is no violence) something does happen: policymakers decide that the cost of violence is too high for them to pursue the act the defender aims to prevent. Put differently, it is not that nothing happened, but rather that we cannot easily see it.\n## The Dog That Did Bark\nI use the phrase the dog that did bark to refer to difficulties around interpreting observations. We cannot deduce an occurrence from an event that correlates with another event. Usually dogs bark when they notice a suspicious person (e.g., a potential murderer); however, of course, we cannot deduce, just because a dog barked that a murder has taken place. Similarly, in the absence of suspicious activity, dogs do not bark. But the fact a dog did not bark does not mean no crime occurred. This analogy allows us to group a number of challenges around determining deterrence failure and success and their implications.\nNotably, the eruption of violence does not necessarily indicate deterrence failure. First, deterrence success is not a binary variable. For example, some scholars argue that, unlike nuclear deterrence, in cases of low(er) levels of violence, decreasing the amount of violence can be considered deterrence success even if it does not totally prevent the violence (Rid 2012; Wenger and Wilner 2012, 318). Second, paradoxically, in some cases, deterrence success increases the level of violence, as an opponent can execute a challenge to provoke retaliation in order to attain political gain.\nNonetheless, not only can we not deduce deterrence failure from violence, but, and more importantly, we cannot deduce deterrence success from observing lack of violence. For example, there may be no challenger. As Morgan (2003, 121) argues, if a state \"has no intention of attacking the case cannot tell us whether deterrence works and how.\" In addition, even if the challenger has motivation to attack the defender, it may refrain for reasons other than the deterrent posture of the defender.\n4 Basically, this challenge could also be termed the dog that did not bark problem. However, in order to avoid confusion, I group this challenge—concerning interpretation of events—as the dog that did bark problem, while I group the problem of bias in case selection as the dog that did not bark.\n5 For example, Mendelsohn (2003, 97–100) interprets the rockets Iraq launched over Israel during the Gulf War in 1992 as an attempt to erode the American-led coalition by provoking Israel to retaliate, assuming that given its credible deterrent posture it would not be able to contain such an attack.\n6 The struggle between Israel and Hizbullah clearly demonstrates this point. Many Israeli officials (e.g., Halutz 2009, 66; Olmert 2014, 15) and scholars (e.g., Aran 2012, 854; Rid 2012, 141) assert that Israel established a deterrent posture vis-à-vis Hizbullah, evident in Hizbullah’s restraint after the 2006 War. However, alternative explanations exist for Hizbullah’s relative restraint in different periods of time, including Hizbullah’s limited capability after the war, its\nAMIR LUPOVICI\n1677\nFurthermore, as Lebow and Stein (1990, 345) clearly state, “[W]hen reliable evidence of a challenger’s calculations is lacking, no decision can be made about the coding of the outcome of a deterrence encounter.” Scholars, thus, disagree over whether cases should be classified as deterrence success or failure (Achen and Snidal 1989, 162; Morgan 2003, 121–22): for example, whether to use the number of causalities (see Lebow and Stein 1990, 344) or the level of violence as the line between deterrence failure and success. The challenge of classifying cases is exacerbated by the fact that actors see themselves as the defender and their opponent as the challenger (Lebow and Stein 1989, 221, 223; Morgan 2003, 121–22).\n## The Dog That Should Have Barked\nWhile the two challenges presented above—the dog that did not bark and the dog that did bark—group and refer to known problems and biases in the study of deterrence, the dog that should have barked emphasizes a less-studied challenge. This problem stems from the expectation that the dog needs to bark if something suspicious is happening. As noted above, the counterfactual is that if the dog did not bark, it means something. However, inspired by this analogy we can also create a third cluster: a situation where the dog did not bark, but should have. While this can be seen as a subcategory of the dog that did not bark problem, the counterfactual here is different. Unlike the original, in which the dog had no reason to bark, in this situation, if the dog were aware of the occurrence, then it would definitely be barking. Nonetheless, the dog that should have barked problem also differs from the dog that did bark problem. The dog that did bark points to a situation in which the occurrence is known but its meaning is not. In the dog that should have barked, not only is the interpretation unclear, but what happened remains a mystery.\nFor the purpose of the study of deterrence, this analogy emphasizes situations in which practitioners are unaware of what happened, or at least of situations that have no public record.7 This means that scholars are limited in using these cases. Not only are they unaware of cases of deterrence success (as evident in the dog that did not bark problem), but they may also be unaware of cases of deterrence failure.\n## Current Solutions in Scholarship\nThe dog that did not bark and what I term the dog that did bark point to three main challenges in the study of deterrence: (1) bias in case selection; (2) difficulty of determining deterrence success and deterrence failure, and thus of classifying case studies; and (3) problems in establishing causality, that is, in showing that there is not only a correlation between the issuing of the threats and the avoidance of violence, but that the deterrent threat causes it (George and Smoke 1974, 90–93; Luke 1989, 214; Lebow and Stein 1990, 345; Freedman 2004, 13). Scholars offer a number of solutions to these challenges.\nFirst, scholars urge careful selection of case studies. Among other things, they recommend exploring critical case studies of deterrence failure (Lebow and Stein 1989, 221–22). In addition, Huth and Russett suggest focusing on immediate deterrence rather than on cases of general deterrence. Immediate deterrence is characterized by explicit threats or the movement of alerting military forces, and thus it provides the observer with “reasonable assessment of whether deterrence succeeded or failed” (Huth and Russett 1988, 30). Also, they suggest examining cases of both deterrence failure and deterrence success (Huth and Russett 1990,\ninvolvement in Syria since 2012 and especially since 2013, and the pressure from Iran not to waste resources (Lupovici 2016b, 183).\n7These situations usually result from what Baliga, Bueno De Mesquita, and Wolitzky (2020, 1055) refer to as detection failure, where defenders are unaware that an attack occurred.\nA Methodology for Cyber Deterrence Research\n468–73). However, as Jervis asserts, this solution is limited, as the important question is why deterrence fails and not the frequency of deterrence failures (Jervis 1989, 194).\nSecond, scholars suggest examining the long-term dynamics of enduring rivals to address a number of challenges in the study of deterrence (Stein 1996; Lieberman 2013; Danilovic and Clare 2017, 14–15). This enables the exploration not only of immediate deterrence, but also of general deterrence. Morgan (2003, 82) suggests that focusing only on crises is problematic since it prevents studying the inter-crises periods, which are crucial because actors often attempt to employ general deterrence strategy. Focusing on enduring rivals also addresses the bias in studying mainly cases of deterrence failure. It helps to establish the causal connections by addressing questions around whether the challenger seriously considered war or, if the challenger backed down, whether it was affected by the defender’s deterrent strategy. In addition, it helps to establish a more focused comparison because the same actors are examined over time. Finally, studying enduring rivals also addresses the challenge of identifying the defender and the challenger, by revealing shifts in actors’ balance of interests (Lieberman 2013, 29–32; see also Stein 1996).\nThird, scholars suggest dealing with the challenge of identifying deterrence success by developing hypotheses about the defender, the challenger, and the conflict (Stern, Axelrod, Jervis, and Rander 1989, 6, 19–21, 33). While this solution complements some other solutions, it leads in practice to debates around results without necessarily providing convincing explanations. A prime example of these limitations is the study of whether the actual use of force contributes to enhancing a deterrent posture and demonstrating resolve (Schelling 1966, 116–25; Mercer 1996; Press 2005; Tang 2005; Rid 2012, 128; Lupton 2018, 61–66). This issue is highly debated, and scholars suggest the empirical findings on it are inconclusive and that further research is needed (Huth 1997; Sartori 2005, 9; Weisiger and Yarhi-Milo 2015, 479).\nFourth, scholars have advised relying on primary sources and detailed historical accounts to better determine the defender and challenger and to better establish deterrence success (or failure). This will also decrease selection bias in the study of deterrence (Lebow and Stein 1990, 346–51). Following these ideas, Wilner (2011, 32–33), for example, suggests that primary sources are crucial to establishing the putative challenger’s intentions and how they change. While use of primary sources is promising, a common problem is the difficulty of accessing the kind of evidence needed. Leaders’ statements may not be sincere, especially around the effect of the deterrent threat on behavior. As Morgan asserts, the challenger “won’t announce that it backed down because it was scared: instead, it never planned to attack” (Morgan 2003, 122; see also Huth and Russett 1990, 491). Even in private discussions, policymakers tend not to admit the effect of the opponent’s deterrence strategy (Lebow and Stein 1989, 222). The sources that help address this challenge come from closed meetings, classified policy analyses, and military orders and assessments, all of which are hard to trace (Huth and Russett 1990, 491). However, they do provide much stronger evidence of whether and how deterrent threat shapes a putative challenger’s behavior.\n## Challenges in Studying Cyber Deterrence\nThe challenges around studying conventional and nuclear deterrence are much more pressing in the context of cyber deterrence. Not only do interactions in the\n8 An example of using these materials is evident in Golov (2013), who explores the effectiveness of American and Israeli deterrence vis-à-vis Iraq during the Gulf War (1991–1992) based on captured documents.\n9 Huth and Russett (1990, 481–82, 491) admit that primary sources provide key evidence for establishing deterrence success. However, they warn that conducting studies based just on such evidence may bias the research, as they are accessible only in a very limited number of cases.\nAMIR LUPOVICI\n1679\ncyber domain aggravate these challenges, but some of the solutions suggested to address them are hard to employ.\n## Cyber Deterrence Research\nMost scholars acknowledge that cyber deterrence involves the use of threats to prevent cyberattacks or attacks on defender’s information systems (Stevens 2012, 149–52; Lupovici 2016a, 324–25).¹⁰ Many agree that successfully employing cyber deterrence strategy is difficult (in Morgan 2010; Stevens 2012, 149–53). Among other things, they argue that defending actors cannot easily pose a credible threat because of the difficulty of identifying the challenger, the large number of potential challengers, the asymmetry between the challengers and the defenders, the low entry costs, the limited public support to retaliate against cyberattacks, and the defenders’ difficulty exposing their capabilities (Harknett 1996; Molander, Riddle, and Wilson 1996, 87; Cordesman and Cordesman 2001, 7; Arquilla 2003, 210–13; Libicki 2007, 271–72; Libicki 2009, 1–3, 26, 44–45; Morgan 2010, 55–76; Geers 2011, 111–22; Fischerkeller and Harknett 2017, 386–87; Kreps and Schneider 2019; Fischerkeller, Harknett, and Vičić 2020, 25–30).\nIndeed, some scholars suggest various methods to enhance the effectiveness of deterrence strategy in dissuading cyberattacks. Recently, scholars have become more optimistic about achieving this goal. For example, scholars offer innovative ways to think about the implications of the attribution problem and how deterrence can work under imperfect attribution (Glaser 2011, 3; Baliga, Bueno De Mesquita, and Wolitzky 2020). Scholars also suggest that the attribution problem can be addressed in various, mainly technical and technological, ways (e.g., Rid and Buchanan 2014; Egloff and Dunn Cavelty 2021) and therefore should not necessarily prevent the execution of retaliation. Furthermore, the attribution problem is not a challenge for deterrence theory per se, but is shaped through social norms that might be changed over time (Lupovici 2016a).\nScholars suggest that, in addition to deterrence by punishment, actors also rely on tailored deterrence; serial and cumulative deterrence; deterrence by denial; deterrence by naming and shaming; deterrence through the development of international norms; and deterrence by detection. Scholars also note that actors could deter by punishment through the threat of using kinetic means, and not just through cyber means (Wheatley and Hayes 1996, 13, 19–20; Cordesman and Cordesman 2001, 7; Kugler 2009; Morgan 2010, 59, 68; Glaser 2011, 4; Stevens 2012; Tor 2017; Nye 2017; Lindsay and Gartzke 2018, 192; Schneider 2019a, 109; Wilner 2020, 253).¹¹ They have also suggested that cyber deterrence is more likely to be effective against a potential cyberattack that is equivalent to armed conflict. This is because in such situations, the impact of the unique characteristics of cyberspace on deterrence will be less pronounced (Fischerkeller, Harknett, and Vičić 2020, 29).\nWhile debates continue, these scholars emphasize the theoretical questions—whether and when cyber deterrence may work—and offer policy implications. Nonetheless, less attention is given to methodological questions and challenges around studying these issues, and to how evidence should be collected and analyzed.\n¹⁰ For a review of this scholarship, see Nye (2017); Mandel (2017, 43–64); Wilner (2020, 251–56).\n¹¹ Cooper (2012, 111–18) suggests the concept of *network deterrence*. He argues that the combination of means such as punishment, futility, and dependency could strengthen deterrence effectiveness when defenders and putative challengers share a network.\nA Methodology for Cyber Deterrence Research\n## The Impact of Problems in Studying Deterrence on the Research on Cyber Deterrence\n### The Dog That Did Not Bark\nLike other studies of deterrence, cyber deterrence scholarship is biased toward focusing on cases of deterrence failure. In fact, the limited access to data and the limited evidence available to scholars result in greater research bias. This is not necessarily a problem for specific studies that focus on a small number of prominent case studies. However, it is a challenge to the scholarship as a whole. As Valeriano and Maness observe, “[c]omparative case studies are rare, given the tendency to focus on events that might be outliers,” such as Estonia (2007), Stuxnet (2010), and Sony Hack (2014), leaving aside typical cyber interactions (Valeriano and Maness 2018, 260). These overlooked interactions may include cases of deterrence success.\nThe research, then, not only tends to examine cases of deterrence failure, but also focuses on a limited number of cases. Methodologically, it is not clear to what extent these cases represent the general “population” of cases of cyber deterrence. For example, the reason that led to the availability of the case for deterrence scholars may also have affected the deterrence outcome. Given the secrecy that surrounds many cyberattack incidents, known cases of deterrence failures may indicate situations in which resolute actors chose to challenge.\n### The Dog That Did Bark\nThis problem concerns how scholars interpret observations: the challenge of establishing whether a certain case is a deterrence failure or success and thus of establishing the causal mechanism of deterrence failure/success. The secrecy around cyber incidents and the limited information available to scholars exacerbate the challenges in deterrence research (see also Burton 2018, 6; Healey and Jenkins 2019, 125). These challenges include actors’ tendency to see themselves as the defender (and not the challenger) and the difficulty of developing a more nuanced classification of deterrence success/failure: one that is not dichotomic but acknowledges that deterrence failure and deterrence success are on a continuum. In a similar way, a significant challenge is to determine what constitutes deterrence failure. While in the kinetic domains, scholars, practitioners, and law experts have over many years developed an understanding of this, it is still debated in the cyber domain (e.g., Schmitt 2017). This further complicates the academic community’s ability to interpret deterrence failure and success, and to classify cases.\nThe challenge of identifying relevant cases not only creates selection bias, but also complicates the ability to determine the impact of the deterrent threat on the putative challenger’s behavior. This difficulty is shaped by the combination of the limitation of available information on cyberattacks and the characteristics of cyberattacks, which make the temporality of the attack a key issue. In kinetic domains, the timing of the attack and of the damage is similar; and in most cases, damage follows shortly after the attack’s execution. For example, it takes a few minutes for an intercontinental missile to hit its target, and damage will follow and start impacting the defender usually less than an hour after the initiation of the attack. Because of the various modes and stages of executing cyberattacks, on the other hand, scholars have to distinguish between the timing of the attack and the timing of the damage (e.g., Brantly and Smeets forthcoming, 4–5). Challengers can better control the timing of the attack. They can predetermine the attack or use the original attack as a platform for future attacks. This increased difficulty in identifying the deterrent threat’s timing and its influence on the putative challenger’s behavior makes study of it much more onerous. Furthermore, it raises a crucial question about the meaning of deterrence success: that is, whether executing an attack can be considered deterrence failure if the damage has yet to occur. All of this inhibits our ability to interpret deterrence success or to classify cases of deterrence failure and success.\nAMIR LUPOVICI\n1681\n# The Dog That Should Have Barked\nUnlike the previous two clusters of challenges, this problem mainly affects the study of cyber deterrence. While the dog that did not bark emphasizes the problems stemming from being unable to observe cases of deterrence success, this problem emphasizes problems stemming from being unable to clearly observe cases of deterrence failure.\nIn other domains, the execution of an attack leaves traces and evidence that scholars can use. These traces help scholars to determine the case as deterrence failure, as well as to examine aspects related to the execution of the challenge: for example, the damage, how it was done, and by whom. In contrast, cyberattacks usually leave fewer traces. In fact, even a significant cyberattack may not be easily traced. For example, a cyberattack may target the electricity grid but be masked as an accident or a failure of the system (see also Schneider 2019a, 114). Furthermore, in some cases, the effectiveness of cyberattacks requires that they will remain untraced. In the well-known case of Stuxnet, the worm aimed not only to damage Iranian centrifuges, but also to confuse the Iranian scientists regarding the sources of the problem (Farwell and Rohozinski 2012, 115).\nWhile the research on cyber deterrence focuses on the problem of attribution—a situation in which the source of an attack is unknown—a key difficulty concerns a more fundamental challenge: the ability to detect that there was an attack in the first place. Brantly, for example, notes that in the cyber domain it is more important “to identify that an attack is occurring . . . than to in the moment identify who is actually conducting the attack” (Brantly 2016, 87). Moreover, regardless of whether or not the victim is aware of the attack, it is a challenge for scholars, who often have limited access to such information. For this reason, some scholars state their main focus is to study compelling success rather than deterrence success. Valeriano, Jensen, and Maness (2018, 24) suggest that “[o]ur choice to focus on compelling is driven by the need to examine the efficacy of operations that seek to achieve demonstrable effects. Compreciency is about changing behavior, while deterrence is about preventing behaviors, the latter being difficult to observe empirically.”\n# The Limitations of Current Solutions\nThe solutions put forward to address challenges in studying deterrence have advanced deterrence research, but they have encountered some difficulties. Applying them to cyber deterrence studies, that focus on exploring deterrence success/failure, creates additional problems, given the unique characteristics of cyber deterrence and how knowledge around cyber incidents and cyber deterrence is produced. While common solutions may become more effective in the future, as technology changes and reliable information on cyber incidents increases, they are currently quite limited.\nOne direction for a solution is to acquire data and conduct quantitative studies based on it. While a few scholars have started to use these methods to examine cyber deterrence success or closely related behavior with interesting findings (e.g., Brantly 2016; Pytlak and Mitchell 2016), they have also pointed to challenges in using data to this end (e.g., Valeriano, Jensen, and Maness 2018, 24). Others also indicate the need to develop new ways to use data given the challenges of studying this strategy (Pytlak and Mitchell 2016, 79).\nBecause of the challenges of studying cyber deterrence, it is difficult to employ the solutions discussed above based on careful selection of specific case studies—that is, focusing on critical case studies and immediate deterrence and exploring\n For example, Brantly’s (2016, 143–49) findings support the assertions that actors’ ability to maintain anonymity enhances the chances for deterrence failure. Nonetheless, Pytlak and Mitchell are unable to establish significant correlation and in the end reach inconclusive interpretations of the evidence (Pytlak and Mitchell 2016, 73–79).\nA Methodology for Cyber Deterrence Research\ncases of deterrence failure as well as of deterrence success. These solutions cannot fully resolve the challenges of determining cyber incidents and identifying and classifying situations of cyber deterrence failure and success. Jervis (1989, 194) has warned that explaining deterrence failure and success is more important than explaining their frequency; this caution is even more important in studying cyber deterrence given that the cases scholars are able to examine are more biased. The challenges of case selection stem not only from the dog that did not bark problem, but also from the dog that did bark and the dog that should have barked problems—biasing cases both of deterrence success and of deterrence failure.\nLikewise, focusing on cases of immediate deterrence also becomes a challenge when studying cyber deterrence, mainly because of the lack of available information and the characteristics of cyberattacks themselves. Scholars must distinguish the time of the attack, the time of its damage, the time the defender acknowledges the attack (and the damage), and the time the attack becomes public knowledge.¹³ The defender itself may be unaware that it needs to employ an immediate deterrence threat. For example, in contrast to other domains, preparations for attacks in the cyber domain leave less traces compared to preparations of kinetic attacks and thus complicate the ability of deterrer actors to pose an immediate deterrent threat. This means that examining cases of immediate deterrence is of limited help in studying cyber deterrence: actors have fewer opportunities to perform this strategy, the existence of known cases of immediate cyber deterrence may be biased,¹⁴ and, most importantly, scholars may not have access to full information on these cases.\nSolutions put forward to better establish the causal connection between the deterrent threat and the challenger behavior face similar challenges. Along with the problems discussed (case selection and identification of deterrence failure and success, which also limit establishing the \"explanation\") is the limited available information on the case studies. This makes additional potential solutions impractical, such as the relying on primary sources. Likewise, while studying enduring rivals could address some of the challenges around establishing causal connections (as well as eliminating biases in case selection), it is questionable whether such enduring rivals and conflicts in the cyber domain exist, or whether scholars can acquire enough relevant information about them to allow such research. Cyber deterrence scholars, therefore, experience significant challenges because of difficulties identifying cases of deterrence success or failure. While these problems accompany the study of deterrence in general—both quantitative and qualitative works—they are worse in the study of cyber deterrence and intensify other challenges. Under these conditions, researchers need to go back to the same case studies, in this way possibly missing other important factors affecting the practices of deterrence.\n## Toward a Methodology for Studying Cyber Deterrence\nThe challenges discussed above, and the limited applicability of current solutions to address them, increase the attractiveness of an alternative methodological solution to explore cyber deterrence. While, it is impossible to fully resolve all the challenges in the study of cyber deterrence, this article provides some directions toward this goal. I advance a solution based on studying the adoption of cyber deterrence strategy. By the adoption of cyber deterrence strategy, I refer to one of two things: (1) a strategic change, in which an actor moves toward a decision to rely on at least one type of cyber deterrence strategy (e.g., punishment, denial, detection),\n¹³On policy decisions to reveal or conceal experiencing cyberattacks, see Baram and Sommer (2019).\n¹⁴Given how difficult it is for the defender to identify the need to issue an immediate cyber deterrence threat, the fact that a defender successfully identifies this need may itself affect its ability to issue a successful deterrent threat. Whereas in other domains the putative challenger may also attempt to disguise its attempt to attack, defender actors have more means to identify it prior to the attack.\nAMIR LUPOVICI\n1683\nor (2) the actual employment of such a strategy. In both cases, the adoption of a cyber deterrence strategy can also refer to a shift in how the strategy of deterrence is practiced.\nStudying the adoption of deterrence strategies has not been given enough scholarly attention. Indeed, my exploration of this phenomenon overlaps with various studies on different types of deterrence strategies (e.g., nuclear, conventional).¹⁵ Some scholars, as noted above, have even started to specifically study cyber deterrence adoption (Kugler 2009, 311–13; Stevens 2012; Adamsky 2018; Healey 2019; Gold 2020, 8–21; Wilner 2020). Nonetheless, few of these studies theorize this adoption, being more interested in the historical process through which deterrence was embraced.¹⁶ Furthermore, these scholars do not see research on adoption of the strategy as a methodological solution to challenges in studying deterrence.\nIn contrast, I suggest focusing on the adoption of deterrence strategy as a way to address the methodological challenges of studying (cyber) deterrence. Such a focus allows scholars to explore the various ways actors adopt this strategy and to apply different methods to ascertain this phenomenon and explain it. But before detailing the advantages of studying the adoption and employment of deterrence strategies, it is useful to categorize them. For example, the various ways actors adopt cyber deterrence strategies can be categorized based on the threat they aim to dissuade and their types, means, and degrees of explicitness.\n## The Undesired Activity to Be Deterred\nActors can use cyber deterrence to deter threats not only in the cyber domain but also in other domains. In the former, the strategy of cyber deterrence can be used to deter different types of cyber threats that vary in intensity, complexity, and feasibility (e.g., Brantly 2016, 116–17; Burton 2018, 28–29). Brantly, for example, distinguishes three main categories of activities actors attempt to deter: cyberattacks, cyber espionage, and cyber theft (Brantly 2020, 8–9).¹⁷ Defending actors may also develop a cross-domain deterrence strategy to dissuade threats conducted through cyber space that target supply chains or critical infrastructures or that may affect military activities and effectiveness (Schneider 2019a, 103, 108–9).\nOther categories of employing cyber deterrence strategy concern the use of cyber means to dissuade attacks in kinetic domains (Lupovici 2016a, 325). For example, cyber means may bolster conventional deterrence (Schneider 2019a, 115–19, but see Libicki 2016, 281). In a similar way, cyber means may affect nuclear deterrence. Some scholars estimate that advances in artificial intelligence may undermine nuclear deterrence (Lieber and Press 2017, 10; Horowitz 2019, 782; Johnson 2020, 429–38). However, others who study developments in Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA), including the advancement of autonomous machines and computerized devices, point to how in some situations these systems may enhance deterrence vis-à-vis different kinds of kinetic attacks (Fortmann and Von Hlatky 2009, 309–12).\nA related question about the type of threat is the specific phase of the cyberattack defenders wish to deter. Brantly and Smeets (forthcoming, 4–5) distinguish among different stages of cyberattack, such as the penetration of the defender’s system to\n¹⁵ Some scholars indirectly refer to the adoption of the strategy while studying “deterrence success” as part of operationalizing deterrence threat. For example, in defining the issuing of an immediate extended deterrent threat, Huth and Russett argue that scholars need to focus on “observable behavioral indicators in the form of statements and military actions that signal the threat to use force if the protégé is attacked.” According to them, even if this is a bluff, it is part of practicing deterrence (Huth and Russett 1990, 488). However, their goal of operationalizing the issuing of the deterrent threat is to establish covariance as part of explaining deterrence success.\n¹⁶ This type of approach is clearly evident in Freedman and Michaels’ (2019) seminal book on the evolution of nuclear strategies in different periods of time and in different countries.\n¹⁷ In addition, scholars refer to more specific challenges, such as deterring the use of information warfare through cyber platforms (Whyte 2020b, 237–39).\nA Methodology for Cyber Deterrence Research\ninstall the means of attack and the execution of the attack to actually generate the damage.\n## Types of Deterrent Strategies\nActors differ in what specific type of deterrent strategies, or combination of them, they adopt. Currently, in addition to deterrence by punishment, scholars tend to emphasize the following types of cyber deterrence strategies: tailored deterrence (Kugler 2009), punctuated/cumulative deterrence (Kello 2017; Tor 2017, 205–11), deterrence by denial (Iasiello 2013; Libicki 2016, 268–70; Nye 2017, 56–7), deterrence by detection or by accusation (Lindsay and Gartzke 2018, 192; Finnemore and Hollis 2020, 980–81), and deterrence by naming and shaming and through development of international norms (Nye 2017, 60–62; Stevens 2012; see also Libicki 2009, 68).\n## The Deterrent Means\nNot only can actors adopt different types of cyber deterrence strategies, but they can also employ each strategy with different means. For example, deterrence by punishment may be based not only on the defender’s cyber means, but also on its economic, diplomatic, and kinetic means (e.g., Kugler 2009, 328; Jasper 2017, 95–96; Schneider 2019a). In a similar way, actors can employ deterrence by denial not only by communicating their defensive means, but also by communicating their means to avoid the damage, such as by establishing backup systems to ensure the resilience of the information infrastructures (see also Nye 2017, 57).\n## Degree of Explicitness\nWhether and how actors publicly declare they will respond to a challenge is fundamental to understanding these practices in any domain of conflict (Brantly 2016, 113). Given the fact that communicating threats is a core element of deterrence strategy, the degree of explicitness is a key characteristic of how cyber deterrence strategy is adopted and employed. Deterrent threats are communicated through a wide spectrum of expressions—ranging from full explicitness to lack of any reference to the deterrent threat—that contain three main elements:\nOne element is how the threat is articulated and directed at an opponent: for example, whether the threat is generally stated in a strategic document (e.g., Department of Defense 2011) or the defender targets specific opponents (e.g., Department of Defense 2018, 1).\nA second element is how explicitly the undesired activity the defender wants to prevent is communicated. Scholars have debated over this issue when studying deterrence in other domains, contemplating whether a red line should be clearly stated or not (e.g., Lockhart 1978, 548–51; Schelling 1981, 38–41).\nA third element is the extent to which the deterrent threat itself is communicated. Actors differ in how explicitly they present the consequences that will stem from the challenger’s undesired activity: whether, for example, the defender specifies the retaliatory punishment or only presents it generally. A number of US documents have stated that the United States preserves the right to retaliate against a cyberattack with all the means they hold (Department of Defense 2011, 2; Department of Defense 2013, 32, 41–42; see also in Healey 2019; and in Wilner 2020). While some argue that actors can achieve a deterrent effect by specifying what a retaliatory strike will include (to a specific challenger) (e.g., Kugler 2009, 331–32), others suggest that states often issue a more general threat, using ambiguity as a mechanism of deterrence (e.g., Brantly 2016, 114). Conversely, actors may refrain from explicitly\nAMIR LUPOVICI\n1685\nadopting a cyber deterrence strategy and remain silent in this regard. They may choose to contain attacks in order to avoid further escalation and may consider a deterrent strategy as inadequate to address the challenges. Actors may also retaliate without issuing a deterrent threat prior to their response.\nOther possibilities exist between full explicitness and non-explicitness in communicating deterrent threats. Kugler (2009, 311–3), for example, reviews key US documents since 2003 and concludes that while they acknowledge the need to develop cyber deterrence strategy, they do not elaborate on how it can be attained.¹⁸ Likewise, actors, such as in the Israeli case, may discuss the need to adopt a strategy of cyber deterrence or wish to develop such a strategy but refrain from directly and explicitly issuing deterrent threats. In the last decade, senior Israeli policymakers have made the point that Israel should acquire a cyber deterrence strategy. For example, when serving as minister of defense, Ehud Barak suggested that in the uncertainty that cyber capabilities create, “leadership is required to show the way as to how to do the right thing for Israel and to establish a deterrent balance” (Barak 2012). Prime Minister Netanyahu also explained the need to develop a cyber deterrence strategy despite the fact that “[t]he ability to deter is more difficult because the source of such an attack is more anonymous. This is a problem we will certainly have to address” (Netanyahu 2011).\nInterestingly, in May 2020, it seems that Israel has moved to adopt an even more explicit cyber deterrence strategy when its retaliation against targets in Iran in response to a cyberattack on water infrastructures in Israel was reported (Warrick and Nakashima 2020). The publication of the Israeli retaliation, as well as other statements made by Israeli officials such as by Minister of Defense, Naftali Bennett, were interpreted as an attempt of Israel to send deterrent messages to the Iranians and to draw a red line (Siman Tov and Even 2020).\nSending deterrent messages through acts of retaliation is closely related to the concepts of punctuated deterrence and cumulative deterrence, where the actual use of force aims to punish and deliver a threatening message over a long period of time (Kello 2017, 205–11; Tor 2017). Even before the incidents of May 2020, some experts interpreted Israel’s offensive cyber capabilities in this context, claiming they aim in part to deter potential challengers and “show potential attackers what Israel is able to do if it chooses to respond to an attack” (Cohen, Freilich and Siboni 2016, 313).\nSome degree of explicitness—and thus communication and signaling—is a crucial aspect of these practices. According to Kello (2017, 209), “Diplomatic and signaling procedures will be required to demonstrate to adversaries that for the purpose of punishment, individual hostile actions are regarded as a comprehensive package of offensive activity rather than being disparate actions that merit isolated responses.” Likewise, as Tor (2017, 107) asserts, just the use of force is insufficient in creating a cumulative cyber deterrent strategy, as there is also a need to “to outline the ‘rules of the game’ in a clear way.”¹⁹\n## Advantages in Focusing on Adoption of Cyber Deterrence Strategy\nFocusing on the adoption and employment of cyber deterrence has a number of theoretical and methodological advantages: it diversifies research by highlighting an overlooked phenomenon, it invites plural approaches and methods that help to better explain and understand actors’ behavior, and it thus emphasizes\n¹⁸ In this respect, comparing US documents reveals a growing specification of cyber deterrence strategies over the years (e.g., in Kugler 2009, 311–13).\n¹⁹ Examples of less explicit messages that serve deterrent goals can be found in leaking of information around cyberattacks—such as Stuxnet, the corruption of Syria’s air defense system, the Chinese penetration of American health insurer files, and the Russian hack into the US Democratic Party files (Perkovich and Levite 2017, 273; see also Mazanec and Thayer 2014, 69).\nA Methodology for Cyber Deterrence Research\nthe importance of various strategic, normative, and cultural aspects related to this phenomenon. While to some extent these advantages could also be achieved by diverting the study around cyber deterrence failure/success to these directions, the main advantage lies in the observability that studying the adoption of the strategy allows. Not only does this advantage stand by its own in improving our understanding of the practices of cyber deterrence, but it also enhances the other advantages: diversification of the research and the use of plural methods.\n## Observability\nThe main advantage of studying the adoption and employment of deterrence strategy is the ability to trace empirical evidence of it. The idea behind a strategy of deterrence, as discussed above, is to issue and communicate threats. The communication can be more or less explicit—and can even be a bluff; however, it is a crucial part of practicing this strategy.\nEven if the deterrent threat is a bluff,²⁰ the methodological solution based on studying the adoption and employment of (cyber) deterrent strategy cannot be dismissed based on an assertion that issuing deterrent threats is cheap talk. Given the cult of reputation and practitioners' worry about resolve (e.g., Tang 2005; Kertzer 2016),²¹ a defender may find it costly to not execute the deterrent threat or retaliate in case the undesired attack has been made by the putative challenger. They may fear that other actors will challenge them in the future because of the alleged demonstration of weakness. Actors thus are likely to take the adoption of cyber deterrence strategy and the issuing of deterrent threat seriously; issuing deterrent threats, therefore, provides indications of an actor's strategy.\nFocusing on observable indications allows scholars to address challenges in the study of cyber deterrence that stem from limited access to details around practicing cyber deterrence that in many cases remain unknown, such as the attack, the damage, and when the defender identified it was attacked. First, the problem of the dog that did not bark and the problem of the dog that should have barked become less pressing. Focusing on strategy adoption and the issuing of deterrent threat involves observing changes in the behavior of the defender actor. From this perspective, and as further discussed below, scholars can study nuances in strategy adoption, conduct comparisons among actors and over time, and explain this phenomenon regardless of the putative challenger's behavior or of the deterrence strategy outcomes. In other words, the research will not be biased toward studying specific cases of deterrence failure.\nStudying cyber deterrence strategy adoption also addresses challenges around the dog that did bark problem. By focusing mainly on the behavior of the defender actor, scholars have much less difficulty in interpretation, as the outcome to be examined and explained is less ambiguous. Indeed, scholars may debate over whether an actor actually adopted a cyber deterrence strategy, how it differs from its previous strategies, and about its specific elements. However, because adopting and employing a strategy of deterrence requires some degree of explicitness—unlike deterrence successes and even cyber deterrence failures—scholars also have much more access to empirical evidence to discuss and dispute.\n²⁰ Likewise, as Libicki (2016, 227) and Tor (2017, 107) note actors may deliver their deterrent messages not only in public channels but also in secret ones. While for scholars the delivering of deterrent messages secretly poses difficulties of observing and studying the occurrences, actors have incentives to make some public manifestations of the deterrent threat they issue, even indirectly, in order to target larger audiences. In addition, the focus of the suggested methodology is on the strategy, and not necessarily on the communication of a specific threat to a certain opponent. For example, in theory, a cyber deterrence strategy may be adopted explicitly, but the explicit strategic document may also acknowledge that in some situations the communication of the deterrent threat will be delivered privately.\n²¹ For further discussion of costly signals, cheap talk, and deterrence, see Fearon (2002, 13–16), Lupton (2018, 64), but also see Danilovic (2002, 130–40).\nIn addition, studying cyber deterrence strategy adoption makes more effective use of the methodological solutions traditional deterrence scholars offer to the challenges of exploring this strategy. First, scholars have pointed in different ways to the need to selectively choose case studies, such as studying critical cases of deterrence failure, or studying enduring rivals. While the main solution this article offers is somewhat different—focusing on the adoption/employment of the strategy—in fact, these solutions complement each other: for example, exploring the adoption, changes, and abandoning of cyber deterrence strategies over time between enduring rivals.\nOther solutions have aimed to better establish the causal mechanism (of deterrence success). Because of the observability of both cyber deterrence adoption and the elements that may account for it, the solution of developing specific hypotheses about the defender, the challenger, and the situation is useful direction to take. Scholars can observe the characteristics of cyber deterrence strategy adoption (e.g. explicitness, timing, the type of the cyber deterrence, the means to establish it, and the kind of challenge it aims to dissuade). In a similar way, scholars can provide various factors affecting such adoption, including elements of perceptions, culture, and norms on the one hand, and the strategic utility of the strategy on the other. Likewise, as further discussed below, they may explore the social context in which the strategy is embedded.\nFocusing on the adoption of the strategy is closely related to another solution advised by traditional deterrence scholars—that is, to rely on primary sources. Strategy adoption, being observable, provides sources to empirically establish the study of cyber deterrence. However, focusing on adoption also opens up other types of sources. Strategic documents establish the employment of the strategy, such as the US Department of Defense Cyberspace Policy Report, Department of Defense Defense Science Board, and the Department of Defense Cyber Strategy. Other relevant sources help to understand and explain how actors adopt cyber deterrence strategy, in this way exploring the various elements presented above. For example, primary documents that trace how perceptions on cyber (domain) change over time and how the cyber (domain) is constructed (e.g. in Raymond 2019, 203--35) could provide an account of changes in actors' willingness to employ this strategy in the cyber domain.\nThe methodological solution I propose—focusing on the adoption and employment of the strategy rather on deterrence success—provides important indications of actors' perceptions of the strategy's effectiveness. Scholars can explore specific cases and conduct longitudinal and cross-sectional comparisons of actors who adopt (or refrain from adopting) cyber deterrence strategy. For example, a growing international tendency to rely on this strategy may imply increasing effectiveness of the strategy or at least an increase in the perception of its effectiveness. Indeed, there are different explanations as to why actors adopt and employ a strategy of (cyber) deterrence—and these should be explored. Nonetheless, given the limited access to information about deterrence success, solutions based on focusing on the strategy's adoption provide important alternatives.\nTechnological developments provide one explanation (or hypothesis) for the adoption of cyber deterrence strategy. For example, given the problem of attribution, technologies that help defenders trace the source of an attack may enhance this strategy's efficiency and hence its attractiveness. In a similar way, improvements in defensive measures, measures to increase resilience, and organization skills in operating these measures (Slayton 2017, 89--90, e.g. Matania and Tal-Shir 2020) may make strategies of deterrence by denial more attractive. While these are plausible hypotheses, we cannot reduce the adoption of (cyber) deterrence strategies to technological advancement. Other explanations could be developed, for example,\nA Methodology for Cyber Deterrence Research\nbased on actors' (strategic) culture (e.g., Knopf 2013, 9–10).²³ A number of reviews of cyber security policies and strategies of different countries (e.g., Luijjf, Besseling, Spoelstra, and De Graaf 2013; Liveri and Sarri 2014; Baezner and Cordey 2019) provide not only the social context of cyber deterrence strategies, but also information to help explain their adoption (or lack thereof). The strategic, political, and cultural elements these reports review are useful points of departure toward that goal.\nInternational norms could also affect the adoption of cyber deterrence strategy. Nye, for example, suggests that deterrence through the establishment of international norms is one means of employing cyber deterrence. This strategy is based on creating taboos that increase the costs of attacking certain cyber targets (e.g., civilian cyber infrastructures) (Nye 20167, 60–62). From this perspective, the emergence of norms incentivizes actors to rely on practices of deterrence and adopt and employ them. Furthermore, the emergence of new norms can also affect other types of deterrence strategy, including deterrence by punishment. Actors may be more motivated to adopt such a strategy, for example, if cyberattacks are constructed as acts of violence. Seeing a challenge as “violent” increases an actor’s willingness to employ threats to dissuade it, thus enhancing deterrence effectiveness. The existence of a norm that portrays cyberattacks in this way legitimizes a retaliatory strike and thus the adoption of this strategy in the first place (Lupovici 2016a, 333–34).²⁴ In recent years, scholars have begun to explore how public perceptions of cyber conflicts and dynamics affect support for retaliation against cyberattacks (Kreps and Schneider 2019; Shandler, Gross, and Canetti 2021). Public attitudes open up a broad area for research connecting normative, political, and institutional factors that also affect the adoption of cyber deterrence strategies.\n## Diversifying Cyber Deterrence Research\nBy focusing on the strategy’s adoption, we can examine and compare various kinds of actors, especially actors other than those commonly examined. In particular, the United States is overrepresented in the research. There are a number of reasons for this—including that many scholars are American and aim to influence the US strategy, that the United States is considered a cyber power, and the greater availability of American documents. Therefore, US cyber deterrence will probably continue to be closely examined.\nHowever, the observability of the adoption and employment of the strategy makes information on other cases also relatively accessible, which may help to fill the gap and advance our understanding of other countries. One of the research puzzles concerns actors who have not adopted an explicit cyber deterrence strategy—Israel being a key example. Despite the fact that deterrence is a strategy Israel has adopted vis-à-vis various threats (Lupovici 2016b), so far Israel has refrained from issuing direct cyber deterrent threats.\nDiversifying the research to include other states is also intriguing given the differing views on the strategy of deterrence and cyber security. Studying whether and how these actors adopt and employ cyber deterrence strategies helps to develop a more nuanced understanding of what cyber deterrence is and why and how it is used.\nWe can also extend the study of cyber deterrence to explore non-state actors. In recent years, deterrence scholarship has started to acknowledge other actors involved in the practices of deterrence (Paul, Morgan, and Wirtz 2009). Scholars have explored not only how states attempt to deter non-states threats (e.g., Wilner 2015, 37–74), but also how different kinds of non-state actors, such as terrorist\n²³I discuss below some more specific cultural explanations for adopting a strategy of deterrence.\n²⁴For further discussion on the question of “violence,” use of force, cyberattacks, and legitimate retaliation, see Waxman (2011), Harrison Dinniss (2012, 63–75), Schmitt (2017, chapter 14, 16), and Schneider (2019a, 115).\nAMIR LUPOVICI\n1689\norganizations, issue deterrent threats, including against state actors (e.g., Sobelman 2016). Emerging research on the cyber domain acknowledged the increasing importance of non-state actors in world politics, specifically in international security (Carr 2011; Valeriano and Maness 2015, 164–87; Maurer 2018). However, these notions have rarely been used to explore non-state cyber actors’ involvement in the practices of deterrence, especially their adoption of deterrent strategy and issuing of deterrent threats (but see Teplinsky 2013, 319–21; Burton 2018, 18–21, 23–25; Wilner 2020, 268, 272–73, Lilli 2021). It may be difficult to access this information; however, it will be more accessible than direct information on cases of cyber deterrence successes these actors are involved in.\n## Inviting Plural Research Methods\nThe study of the adoption and employment of cyber deterrence strategies invites positivist and interpretative methods. Positivist scholars can study causal mechanisms of this phenomenon through quantitative and qualitative methods. Scholars can focus on specific case studies or conduct longitudinal and cross-sectional comparative works on actors who adopted, were late to adopt, or did not adopt cyber deterrence strategy.\nFocusing on adoption is a promising direction for examining whether, how, and why an actor adopts and employs a certain type of cyber deterrence strategy. One option is to explore the evolution of the strategy: for example, by tracing a shift in a state’s cyber strategy. The changes in 2018 in US cyber policy provide a useful demonstration of these dynamics, illustrating the advantages of the suggested framework. In 2018, the United States adopted a cyber strategy based on *defend forward* and *persistent engagement* (e.g., compare Department of Defense 2011 with Department of Defense 2018; see also Healey 2019; Kosseff 2019, 5; Wilner 2020, 266–67). While there is debate over how far this strategy diverts from an emphasis on deterrence, experts ascribe the shift to the limited applicability of deterrence strategy in the cyber domain (e.g., Fischerkeller and Harknett 2017; see also King and Gallagher 2020, 27–28).²⁵\nThis policy change led to some interesting questions. Foremost, the timing of this shift is worth exploring. Doubts over the effectiveness of cyber deterrence strategy were expressed as early as the 1990s. This implies that the 2018 change was informed by notions beyond those of the limitations of cyber deterrence strategy—for example, by the acknowledgment that adversaries in cyber space are in constant contact (e.g., Fischerkeller and Harknet 2017; Fischerkeller, Harknett, and Vičić 2020, 25–30). This shows that acceptance of new ideas and their successful promotion by individuals and networks may also be crucial in accounting for this change. Healey suggests that the change “stems directly from this Goldman–Fischerkeller–Harknett lineage (and subsequently drove the DoD Cyber Strategy and parts of the White House National Cyber Strategy). This is perhaps unsurprising “as all three are international relations scholars who have worked at US Cyber Command” (Healey 2019, 5). Processes of learning, persuasion, and individual characteristics can all help to explain whether and how cyber deterrence strategy is shifting, accepted, and employed.²⁶\nLearning may be also seen as a result of cyberattacks experienced by the United States, which led practitioners to emphasize the need to shift to persistent engagement. Whyte (2020a, 210–11) summarizes this point: “[N]umerous commentators . . . note the significance of Russian political warfare in 2016 as a realisation mo\n²⁵ Likewise, Libicki concludes that the United States should not make cyber deterrence an explicit strategy and that it should not rely on it (Libicki 2016, 266).\n²⁶ For similar dynamics regarding learning nuclear deterrence, see Kaplan (1991), Adler (1992), and Evangelista (1999). These studies show, in different ways, that although technological developments are crucial, they are insufficient to account for the adoption of deterrence strategies.\nA Methodology for Cyber Deterrence Research\nment prompting the development of the new, more assertive strategy.” Structural changes also allowed for and guided this shift. For example, comparing the 2018 cyber strategy with its predecessor (DoD 2015), Kollars and Schneider (2018) note “The 2018 Cyber Strategy reflects the changes in the political, technical, and institutional environment over the last three years.”\nAnother research direction that focuses on the adoption of the strategy could examine the exact nature, rather the efficiency, of the strategy²⁷: that is, examining whether and which type of deterrence strategy the new adopted policy aims to advance. Scholars have debated over whether the 2018 strategy emphasizes deterrence strategy (see, Healey 2019, 3–4). On the one hand, it was developed and justified based on the limits of cyber deterrence as discussed above. For example, Kreps and Schneider (2019, 9) assert that persistent engagement is better suited than deterrence. According to them, “[D]eterrence hinges on public resolve for overwhelming uses of force and a willingness to escalate, which appears lacking in the cyber domain, whereas persistent engagement can operate at a lower intensity of confrontation—albeit one that is relatively continuous—that gains legitimacy by virtue of the public support.”\nNonetheless, while experts acknowledge the shift in the US strategy, they also point to different types of deterrence strategy that the new policy emphasizes and to how it might actually enhance the US deterrent posture. For Whyte (2020a, 210), the new strategy marks a shift from deterrence by denial to a kind of deterrence by punishment. Likewise, Kollars and Schneider (2018) identify a specific shift in US strategy toward tailored deterrence against China and Russia, compared with a former comprehensive cyber deterrence strategy vis-à-vis a “wide array of actors and actions.” Furthermore, persistent engagement based on offensive action might strengthen deterrence strategy by signaling resolve and establishing escalation dominance (Kollars and Schneider 2018; Miller and Pollard 2019; Valeriano and Jensen 2019). In a similar way, the US Cyber Command Vision statement implements the idea of persistent engagement as a way to enhance the US deterrent posture. According to this document, “Through persistent action and competing more effectively below the level of armed conflict, we can influence the calculations of our adversaries, deter aggression, and clarify the distinction between acceptable and unacceptable behavior in cyberspace” (USCYBERCOM 2018, 6).\nThese discussions demonstrate not only the importance of looking into a cyber (deterrence) strategy, explaining it, and analyzing its components, but also the feasibility of conducting such research. Although, scholars can interpret the evidence differently, and the meaning and implications of the strategy may change over time, there is accessible and important evidence to work with. Furthermore, it helps to demonstrate how the suggested methodology provides an alternative to the challenges of studying deterrence success. While we still have little information about the outcomes of this strategy, we can start by considering the various aspects of its adoption.\nIn addition to focusing on one case study or on shifts in actors’ cyber deterrence strategy, such as the those discussed above (the case of Israel response in May 2020 and the 2018 US policy), scholars can also conduct broader comparisons. These can explore the reasons for the differences in how countries adopt and employ cyber deterrence strategies or compare an actor’s adoption and employment of cyber deterrence strategy with its adoption and employment of deterrence strategy\n²⁷ The idea of persistent engagement sparked a debate over whether and to what extent cyber operations are effective in attaining strategic goals, and specifically whether and how they contribute to cyber deterrence success. While scholars acknowledged a number of advantages of the new policy, they were also worried that the criteria for success of this new strategy are not entirely clear; that employing it might be too costly; that it might lead to escalation; and that it may deteriorate US relationships with its allies (Healey 2019, 7–11; Lin and Smeets 2019; Miller and Pollard 2019; Smeets 2019a; Schneider 2019b; Smeets 2019b; Valeriano and Jensen 2019).\nAMIR LUPOVICI\n1691\nin other domains.²⁸ Likewise, we can study the diverse effects of the emergence of international norms on different actors. Scholars may also look into changes over time in how an actor adopts and employs its cyber deterrence strategy. The deterrent threat and the deterrent means may become more or less explicit, the putative challengers may be named (or not), and over time actors may remove or add means and different methods for practicing cyber deterrence.\nAn obvious advantage here is the access to comparable information and data. Scholars, thus, not only can conduct quantitative research that explores different aspects of the adoption of cyber deterrence strategies, but can also use data sets already available. This direction accords with Pytlak and Mitchell’s (2016, 79) recommendation to develop new techniques to address and use data in a way that overcomes the limited “amount of information publicly available.”\nBased on the data collected and analyzed by Brantly (2016), Valeriano, Jensen, and Maness (2018), and Kostyuk and Zhukov (2019), scholars are able to develop interesting notions about the adoption of deterrence strategy. For example, following these studies, it is possible to ask whether actors who absorbed significant cyberattacks tend to consider adopting cyber deterrence strategies to balance their insecurities, or whether more powerful actors tend to rely on this strategy, for example, based on long-term deterrence through previous execution of cyber means (i.e., cumulative cyber deterrence).²⁹ These notions fit some of the assertions Valeriano et al. make, such as those about credibility and signaling (Valeriano, Jensen, and Maness 2018, 46–47), as well as about the long-term aims of cyber operations (Valeriano, Jensen, and Maness 2018, 11). Similarly, the cyber power score Brantly (2016, 138–40, 169) develops enables some hypotheses about the adoption of cyber deterrence strategies: for example, whether weaker states tend to adopt deterrence strategies to balance their inferiority (e.g., explicitly adopt the strategy) or to avoid it, fearing that adopting it will contribute to escalation. Based on these data, scholars can also compare whether and why different actors adopt different types of cyber deterrence strategies: for example, whether weaker actors rely on strategies such as deterrence by naming and shaming or deterrence by detection.\nThe suggested methodology based on studying the adoption of the strategy not only enables positivistic studies, but may also fit well with interpretative frameworks and research on deterrence. Interpretative scholars who study deterrence have started to employ discourse analysis to examine the practices of deterrence (Cohn 1987; Luke 1989; Dauber 1993; Harrington 2016; Vuori 2016). While these methods have not been fully applied to study cyber deterrence, this could be done through focusing on the adoption and employment of the strategy and on the language used. One specific promising direction is to study the adoption and employment of deterrence as securitizing moves (Lupovici 2019). Scholars have started to explore different securitizing moves related to cyber (Bendrath, Eriksson, and Giacomello 2007; Dunn Cavelty 2008; Hansen and Nissenbaum 2009; Deibert and Rohozinski 2010; Dunn Cavelty 2013; Stevens 2016). Looking into the adoption of cyber deterrence strategy provides intriguing cases to further apply the theory of securitization to traditional security challenges. This direction may cover various securitizing moves: for example, the American attempt to securitize cyber challenges to justify various means of retaliation, including even nuclear weapons, in the case of an “existential cyber attack” (Department of Defense 2013, 42; see also Wilner 2020, 261).\nIn a similar way, interpretative approaches highlight the importance of the social context in which deterrence strategy is embedded. These notions can be also ap-\n²⁸ One goal of comparing cyber deterrence with deterrence in other domains is to validate the assertion that the adoption of cyber deterrence may indicate, even indirectly, deterrence success, as discussed above.\n²⁹ Likewise, reports that document cyber incidents may also prove useful in tracing previous cyber operations and their influence on actors’ adoption of cyber deterrence strategies; see, for example, the project of the Council on Foreign Relations at https://www.cfr.org/cyber-operations.\nA Methodology for Cyber Deterrence Research\nplied to study cyber deterrence: for example, in examining how the strategy's adoption and employment are shaped by international norms, (strategic) culture, and actors' identity. This is important to better understand how and why actors adopt cyber deterrence strategies, but also because the way the strategy is adopted indicates and reflects political, normative, and cultural elements. Although scholars have not used these elements to study cyber deterrence adoption (but see Adamsky 2018), they have explained deterrence strategy adoption and employment in other domains by pointing to strategic culture (Basrur 2006, 49–79; Adamsky 2017, 166–71), norms (Tannenwald 2007, 45, 291–92), practices (Adler and Pouliot 2011, 9–15, 21–28), rituals (Mälksoo 2021), and actors' identity, emotions, and ontological security (Tannenwald 2007, 45–46; Lupovici 2016b). The adoption and employment of cyber deterrence strategy provide another arena to examine and employ these theories.\n# Conclusions\nThis article suggests that focusing on the adoption and employment of cyber deterrence strategy—rather than studying cyber deterrence success—promises to provide solutions to the methodological challenges associated with the study of this strategy. This article does not claim to advance the only way to explore cyber deterrence. On the contrary, scholars may well find methodological alternatives, as there is still need to collect and analyze data and case studies on deterrence failure/success. Nonetheless, based on clarifying methodological challenges and by offering a categorization of different characteristics of how (cyber) deterrence strategies are adopted, I point to a phenomenon that has received insufficient attention, and studying it carries a number of advantages. Among other things, it provides methodological solutions, it helps diversify the research of deterrence, and it invites plural approaches and methods. This paper thus should be seen as a point of departure for further research and as a call to focus on the adoption and employment of the strategy.\nMore generally, I suggest that elaborating on these issues contributes not only to the study of cyber deterrence, but also to the two fields of research: deterrence and cyber. For the former, the advantage lies in reframing methodological problems and challenges that may be relevant for scholars who explore not only cyber deterrence. Another advantage for deterrence research, in general, lies in studying an understudied phenomenon. More scholarly work has been done on the adoption and employment of deterrence strategies (mainly of nuclear deterrence, e.g., Kaplan 1991; Adler 1992; Evangelista 1999; Freedman and Michaels 2019) than on the adoption of cyber deterrence strategies. Nonetheless, while the study of deterrence strategy adoption lags behind the study of deterrence success, it may well complement it. From this perspective, this article provides a first step in developing a methodology to study the adoption and employment of different types of deterrence strategies in different domains and with different deterrent means.\nThis is, furthermore, an important phenomenon on its own. It may indicate various aspects about actors' strategic thinking, perceptions, culture, and identity. Understanding how, when, and why actors adopt and employ deterrence strategies (or change or abandon them) in various domains may also further the study of cyber deterrence adoption and employment. The study of more traditional strategies of deterrence may reveal additional explanations and possible characteristics to examine, explain, and compare. Conversely, studying the adoption of cyber deterrence may advance the study of more traditional strategies of deterrence. Most notably, studying cyber deterrence emphasizes that adoption of deterrence strategies cannot be taken as given but requires explanation. It also reveals our assumptions in studying deterrence. For example, traditional studies of deterrence take as given that the challenge is an act of violence or that the timing of the attack and the tim\nAMIR LUPOVICI\n1693\ning of the damage for the defender are the same. Studying cyber deterrence shows that these notions have implications for the practice of deterrence and for the study of it.\nRegarding cyber studies, exploring the strategy's adoption may account for changes in actors' behavior. In other words, studying cyber deterrence adoption demonstrates how technological and normative changes affect cyber strategies. In a similar way, we can study how culture, on the one hand, and rational calculations, on the other hand, affect behavior in the cyber domain. Studying cyber deterrence adoption makes cyber behavior more observable. Therefore, we can draw implications from it that go beyond those related solely to deterrence.\n## Acknowledgments\nI would like to thank Patricia Greve, Gallia Lindenstrauss, and the three anonymous reviewers for their extremely helpful comments and suggestions on different drafts of this manuscript.

Studying cyber deterrence presents even greater challenges, as traditional deterrence challenges are exacerbated and interactions in the cyber domain create further difficulties. When studying cyber deterrence, scholars face uncertainty not only in identifying situations of deterrence success, but also—due to the secrecy surrounding cyber practices—in identifying situations of deterrence failure. Despite the many studies on cyber deterrence, methodological solutions to address these challenges still need to be developed. To this end, I suggest focusing on the adoption and employment of the strategy rather than on its success. I argue that since communicating threats is a core element of deterrence, it is easier to observe how the strategy is adopted and employed than whether it succeeds or fails. This focus provides a promising direction to study cyber deterrence and address these challenges.\nEl estudio de disuasión presenta una serie de desafíos, principalmente relacionados con la identificación de casos de éxito de disuasión y la definición de su funcionamiento. El estudio de la ciberdisuasión presenta desafíos aún mayores, ya que los desafíos tradicionales de la disuasión se ven exacerbados y las interacciones en el ámbito cibernético generan más dificultades. Al estudiar la ciberdisuasión, los académicos se enfrentan a la incertidumbre no solo a la hora de identificar situaciones de éxito de disuasión, sino también a la hora de identificar situaciones de fracaso de disuasión debido a la confidencialidad que gira en torno a las prácticas cibernéticas. A pesar de los numerosos estudios sobre la ciberdisuasión, todavía es necesario desarrollar soluciones metodológicas para abordar estos desafíos. Para lograrlo, sugiero enfocarse en la adopción e implementación de la estrategia más que en su éxito. Sostengo que, dado que comunicar amenazas es un elemento clave de la disuasión, es más fácil observar cómo se adopta e implementa la estrategia que identificar si tiene éxito o fracasa. Este enfoque marca un rumbo prometedor para estudiar la ciberdisuasión y abordar estos desafíos.\nL'étude de la dissuasion présente un certain nombre de défis qui sont principalement liés à l'identification de la réussite de la dissuasion et à la définition de la manière dont la dissuasion fonctionne.

While scholars have pointed to the challenges of practicing cyber deterrence, their focus—like that of most deterrence scholars—has been on deterrence success. Most studies assess whether and how deterrence by punishment can be applied to the cyber domain (e.g., in Wilner 2020, 252–54), or whether and how it should be replaced with other strategies or types of deterrence, such as deterrence by denial, or by cumulative deterrence. These studies are part of the tendency Stevens (2016, 24) observes of cyber security studies to be “commonly oriented towards policy concerns.” Nonetheless, less attention is given to methodological challenges around studying cyber deterrence. This article aims to advance the methodology of studying (cyber) deterrence by offering a categorization of the methodological challenges concerning studying deterrence and by offering an alternative way to explore this strategy.\nInspired by the dog that did not bark problem—a bias in the study of deterrence toward cases of deterrence failure —I categorize three clusters of problems regarding the study of deterrence. Besides the dog that did not bark problem, I group additional challenges into two clusters of problems that I term the dog that did bark and the dog that should have barked problems. The former refers to challenges around interpreting cases of deterrence success and failure, and the latter to a bias that stems from the difficulty of identifying attacks and therefore seeing them as deterrence failures.\nBased on this categorization, I review and illustrate the challenges in studying cyber deterrence and the limited applicability of the current solutions offered to address them. These challenges include identifying deterrence success, selecting appropriate cases, and establishing causal connections between issuing the deterrent threat and deterrence success. While these problems generally characterize the study of deterrence, they are exacerbated in studying cyber deterrence, mainly because we cannot observe cyber deterrence successes and failures.\nI claim that one way to solve the challenges in studying cyber deterrence strategy is to shift focus from deterrence success to its adoption and employment. While this is ¹Studying the adoption of cyber deterrence strategies overlaps with broader attempts to explore the motivation behind cyber strategies (e.g., Valeriano, Jensen, and Maness 2018; Gomez 2021).\nA Methodology for Cyber Deterrence Research not the only solution—and indeed scholars still need to study deterrence success—I assert it provides a useful point of departure for thinking about and exploring this strategy.\nA number of scholars have begun to study the adoption of cyber deterrence strategies with illuminating insights. While I rely on this scholarship, I also aim to advance it. The main goal for most of these works is to describe the evolution of the strategy rather than to explain the phenomenon of adopting the strategy. I suggest that using the adoption and employment of the strategy as the explained phenomenon (i.e., *explanandum*) is a promising method because of the observability of these aspects of the strategy. Communicating threats is a core element of a deterrence strategy, which makes the strategy’s adoption and employment much more explicit than its success or failure. This allows me to offer a categorization of how actors diverge in adopting and applying deterrence strategies, based on the goal, type, means, and explicitness of the strategy. This in turn provides a useful framework to study deterrence, and especially cyber deterrence strategies. Furthermore, as I demonstrate below, the study of the adoption and employment of cyber deterrence strategies encourages methodological pluralism, open to both positivist and interpretative methods.\nThe article proceeds as follows: In the first section, I discuss the main problems in the study of deterrence and the main solutions scholars offer to address them. In the second part, I specify the increased pressure of these challenges when studying cyber deterrence and argue that most solutions are not sufficient to remedy the problems. The third section develops a methodology for studying cyber deterrence, based on different characteristics that concern the adoption of the strategy. The fourth section shows and illustrates the promise of focusing on the adoption and employment of cyber deterrence to address the challenges. Such focus provides new research questions, explanations, and hypotheses, and diversifies the research of this strategy. I conclude by discussing the implications of this study on deterrence research in general and on cyber security research.\n## Methodological Challenges in Studying Deterrence Scholars studying deterrence have paid a great deal of attention to methodological issues.³ While it is beyond this paper’s scope to discuss all the methodological challenges in the study of deterrence, I group the main challenges into three clusters. The first is based on what scholars refer to as the dog that did not bark problem. Building on this, I introduce two further problems: the dog that did bark and the dog that should have barked (see table 1).\n## The Dog That Did Not Bark The dog that did not bark problem revolves around selection bias in studying cases of deterrence failure. Scholars are referring to Sherlock Holmes’ ability to solve a murder mystery based on the fact that a dog, present at the night of the murder, did not bark. Key to solving the case is the idea that there is meaning in the fact that something did not happen. The dog did not bark because the dog knew the perpetrator (see also Sauer 2016, 49). Based on this analogy, scholars have pointed to the flawed tendency to focus only on cases of deterrence failure, which provide ³For reviews and comparisons of cyber strategies of different countries, see Thomas (2009), Lewis and Neuneck (2013), Luiijf, Besseling, Spoelstra, and De Graaf (2013), Liveri and Sarri (2014), and Baezner and Cordey (2019). See also King and Gallagher (2020, 144–45).\n³The debates over how to study deterrence, advanced not only research on deterrence and security, but also, and more broadly, studies in international relations (IR) and political science (e.g., see in King, Keohane, and Verba 1994, 24,134–35).\nAMIR LUPOVICI\n\nTable 1. Clusters of methodological challenges in the study of deterrence and cyber deterrence\n|  The problem | Description | Implications for the study of deterrence | Implications for the study of cyber deterrence  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  The dog that did not bark | The fact that the dog did not bark during a murder means something. In other words, it is important to analyze events that did not happen. | Scholars need to study not only cases of deterrence failure, but also cases of deterrence success (where allegedly nothing happens). However, the research suffers from a selection bias. Given the difficulties of studying cases of deterrence success, scholars tend to focus on studying cases of deterrence failure. | The selection bias is more challenging. Given the secrecy that surrounds interactions in the cyber domain, identifying cases of deterrence success is much more difficult, which further biases the study toward studying cases of deterrence failure.  |\n|  The dog that did bark | Interpreting events is very difficult. Dog’s barking does not necessarily mean that there was a murder, and vice versa (if the dog did not bark it does not mean that there was no murder). | Not only is the line between deterrence failure and success not clear-cut, but interpreting whether deterrence succeeded or failed based on the level of violence is problematic. Eruption of violence is not proof of deterrence failure, as lack of violence is not proof of deterrence success. | Interpreting events and concluding deterrence failure and success from observations is even more challenging given the secrecy surrounding cyber incidents and the ambiguity concerning what should be considered as violent attack (which constitute deterrence failure). Therefore, scholars face difficulties in classifying cases and in establishing (causal) explanations.  |\n|  The dog that should have barked | When the dog is not fully aware of the presence of a suspicious person, and therefore is not barking (e.g., in case of a murder, the dog is failing to notice or is noticing too late). | This challenge poses another sort of case selection bias, as obviously scholars are only able to study the cases they are aware of. | Scholars are not only biased toward studying cases of deterrence failure as indicated by the traditional challenge of studying deterrence. In cases of cyber deterrence, scholars are also not fully aware of cases of deterrence failure. This biases the research in different ways, including scholars’ tendency to focus on a limited number of known case studies of cyber deterrence failure for which relatively more information is available.  |\nA Methodology for Cyber Deterrence Research\nconsiderable observable traces to follow—the employment of violence by at least one of the parties . Positivist scholars use this analogy to challenge scholars' ability to provide a full coloration given that they focus on one possible value of the examined variable of deterrence success—that is, deterrence failure. Some scholars have even suggested the problem is deeper, since focusing on deterrence failures leads to exploration of much more resolute actors—those “who select themselves into crises” and therefore are less likely to be deterred .\nWhile the problematic tendency to focus on cases of deterrence failure clearly exists, it should be noted that lack of violence is not a nonoccurrence. As Tannenwald, emphasizes, \"[T]here is no such thing as explaining a non-event . . . What is actually being explained is a contrast between an actual event and a possible alternative counterfactual event.\" What we are in fact asking is not why the dog did not bark, but why the dog was silent, as we have a reasonable expectation that in such situations the counterfactual (e.g., barking) is a likely scenario . From this perspective, when deterrence succeeds (and there is no violence) something does happen: policymakers decide that the cost of violence is too high for them to pursue the act the defender aims to prevent. Put differently, it is not that nothing happened, but rather that we cannot easily see it.\n## The Dog That Did Bark\nI use the phrase the dog that did bark to refer to difficulties around interpreting observations. We cannot deduce an occurrence from an event that correlates with another event. Usually dogs bark when they notice a suspicious person (e.g., a potential murderer); however, of course, we cannot deduce, just because a dog barked that a murder has taken place. Similarly, in the absence of suspicious activity, dogs do not bark. But the fact a dog did not bark does not mean no crime occurred. This analogy allows us to group a number of challenges around determining deterrence failure and success and their implications.\nNotably, the eruption of violence does not necessarily indicate deterrence failure. First, deterrence success is not a binary variable. For example, some scholars argue that, unlike nuclear deterrence, in cases of low(er) levels of violence, decreasing the amount of violence can be considered deterrence success even if it does not totally prevent the violence . Second, paradoxically, in some cases, deterrence success increases the level of violence, as an opponent can execute a challenge to provoke retaliation in order to attain political gain.\nNonetheless, not only can we not deduce deterrence failure from violence, but, and more importantly, we cannot deduce deterrence success from observing lack of violence. For example, there may be no challenger. As Morgan (2003, 121) argues, if a state \"has no intention of attacking the case cannot tell us whether deterrence works and how.\" In addition, even if the challenger has motivation to attack the defender, it may refrain for reasons other than the deterrent posture of the defender.\n\nAMIR LUPOVICI\n\n## The Dog That Should Have Barked\nWhile the two challenges presented above—the dog that did not bark and the dog that did bark—group and refer to known problems and biases in the study of deterrence, the dog that should have barked emphasizes a less-studied challenge. This problem stems from the expectation that the dog needs to bark if something suspicious is happening. As noted above, the counterfactual is that if the dog did not bark, it means something. However, inspired by this analogy we can also create a third cluster: a situation where the dog did not bark, but should have. While this can be seen as a subcategory of the dog that did not bark problem, the counterfactual here is different. Unlike the original, in which the dog had no reason to bark, in this situation, if the dog were aware of the occurrence, then it would definitely be barking. Nonetheless, the dog that should have barked problem also differs from the dog that did bark problem. The dog that did bark points to a situation in which the occurrence is known but its meaning is not. In the dog that should have barked, not only is the interpretation unclear, but what happened remains a mystery.\nFor the purpose of the study of deterrence, this analogy emphasizes situations in which practitioners are unaware of what happened, or at least of situations that have no public record.7 This means that scholars are limited in using these cases. Not only are they unaware of cases of deterrence success (as evident in the dog that did not bark problem), but they may also be unaware of cases of deterrence failure.\n## Current Solutions in Scholarship\nThe dog that did not bark and what I term the dog that did bark point to three main challenges in the study of deterrence: (1) bias in case selection; (2) difficulty of determining deterrence success and deterrence failure, and thus of classifying case studies; and (3) problems in establishing causality, that is, in showing that there is not only a correlation between the issuing of the threats and the avoidance of violence, but that the deterrent threat causes it . Scholars offer a number of solutions to these challenges.\nFirst, scholars urge careful selection of case studies. Among other things, they recommend exploring critical case studies of deterrence failure . In addition, Huth and Russett suggest focusing on immediate deterrence rather than on cases of general deterrence. Immediate deterrence is characterized by explicit threats or the movement of alerting military forces, and thus it provides the observer with “reasonable assessment of whether deterrence succeeded or failed” . Also, they suggest examining cases of both deterrence failure and deterrence success .\n7These situations usually result from what Baliga, Bueno De Mesquita, and Wolitzky (2020, 1055) refer to as detection failure, where defenders are unaware that an attack occurred.\nA Methodology for Cyber Deterrence Research\n468–73). However, as Jervis asserts, this solution is limited, as the important question is why deterrence fails and not the frequency of deterrence failures .\nSecond, scholars suggest examining the long-term dynamics of enduring rivals to address a number of challenges in the study of deterrence . This enables the exploration not only of immediate deterrence, but also of general deterrence. Morgan (2003, 82) suggests that focusing only on crises is problematic since it prevents studying the inter-crises periods, which are crucial because actors often attempt to employ general deterrence strategy. Focusing on enduring rivals also addresses the bias in studying mainly cases of deterrence failure. It helps to establish the causal connections by addressing questions around whether the challenger seriously considered war or, if the challenger backed down, whether it was affected by the defender’s deterrent strategy. In addition, it helps to establish a more focused comparison because the same actors are examined over time. Finally, studying enduring rivals also addresses the challenge of identifying the defender and the challenger, by revealing shifts in actors’ balance of interests .\nThird, scholars suggest dealing with the challenge of identifying deterrence success by developing hypotheses about the defender, the challenger, and the conflict (Stern, Axelrod, Jervis, and Rander 1989, 6, 19–21, 33). While this solution complements some other solutions, it leads in practice to debates around results without necessarily providing convincing explanations. A prime example of these limitations is the study of whether the actual use of force contributes to enhancing a deterrent posture and demonstrating resolve . This issue is highly debated, and scholars suggest the empirical findings on it are inconclusive and that further research is needed .\nFourth, scholars have advised relying on primary sources and detailed historical accounts to better determine the defender and challenger and to better establish deterrence success (or failure). This will also decrease selection bias in the study of deterrence . Following these ideas, Wilner (2011, 32–33), for example, suggests that primary sources are crucial to establishing the putative challenger’s intentions and how they change. While use of primary sources is promising, a common problem is the difficulty of accessing the kind of evidence needed. Leaders’ statements may not be sincere, especially around the effect of the deterrent threat on behavior. As Morgan asserts, the challenger “won’t announce that it backed down because it was scared: instead, it never planned to attack” . Even in private discussions, policymakers tend not to admit the effect of the opponent’s deterrence strategy . The sources that help address this challenge come from closed meetings, classified policy analyses, and military orders and assessments, all of which are hard to trace . However, they do provide much stronger evidence of whether and how deterrent threat shapes a putative challenger’s behavior.\n## Challenges in Studying Cyber Deterrence\nThe challenges around studying conventional and nuclear deterrence are much more pressing in the context of cyber deterrence. Not only do interactions in the\n\nAMIR LUPOVICI\n\n## Cyber Deterrence Research\nMost scholars acknowledge that cyber deterrence involves the use of threats to prevent cyberattacks or attacks on defender’s information systems .¹⁰ Many agree that successfully employing cyber deterrence strategy is difficult (in Morgan 2010; Stevens 2012, 149–53). Among other things, they argue that defending actors cannot easily pose a credible threat because of the difficulty of identifying the challenger, the large number of potential challengers, the asymmetry between the challengers and the defenders, the low entry costs, the limited public support to retaliate against cyberattacks, and the defenders’ difficulty exposing their capabilities .\nIndeed, some scholars suggest various methods to enhance the effectiveness of deterrence strategy in dissuading cyberattacks. Recently, scholars have become more optimistic about achieving this goal. For example, scholars offer innovative ways to think about the implications of the attribution problem and how deterrence can work under imperfect attribution . Scholars also suggest that the attribution problem can be addressed in various, mainly technical and technological, ways (e.g., Rid and Buchanan 2014; Egloff and Dunn Cavelty 2021) and therefore should not necessarily prevent the execution of retaliation. Furthermore, the attribution problem is not a challenge for deterrence theory per se, but is shaped through social norms that might be changed over time .\nScholars suggest that, in addition to deterrence by punishment, actors also rely on tailored deterrence; serial and cumulative deterrence; deterrence by denial; deterrence by naming and shaming; deterrence through the development of international norms; and deterrence by detection. Scholars also note that actors could deter by punishment through the threat of using kinetic means, and not just through cyber means .¹¹ They have also suggested that cyber deterrence is more likely to be effective against a potential cyberattack that is equivalent to armed conflict. This is because in such situations, the impact of the unique characteristics of cyberspace on deterrence will be less pronounced (Fischerkeller, Harknett, and Vičić 2020, 29).\nWhile debates continue, these scholars emphasize the theoretical questions—whether and when cyber deterrence may work—and offer policy implications. Nonetheless, less attention is given to methodological questions and challenges around studying these issues, and to how evidence should be collected and analyzed.\n¹⁰ For a review of this scholarship, see Nye (2017); Mandel (2017, 43–64); Wilner (2020, 251–56).\n¹¹ Cooper (2012, 111–18) suggests the concept of *network deterrence*. He argues that the combination of means such as punishment, futility, and dependency could strengthen deterrence effectiveness when defenders and putative challengers share a network.\nA Methodology for Cyber Deterrence Research\n## The Impact of Problems in Studying Deterrence on the Research on Cyber Deterrence\n### The Dog That Did Not Bark\nLike other studies of deterrence, cyber deterrence scholarship is biased toward focusing on cases of deterrence failure. In fact, the limited access to data and the limited evidence available to scholars result in greater research bias. This is not necessarily a problem for specific studies that focus on a small number of prominent case studies. However, it is a challenge to the scholarship as a whole. As Valeriano and Maness observe, “[c]omparative case studies are rare, given the tendency to focus on events that might be outliers,” such as Estonia (2007), Stuxnet (2010), and Sony Hack (2014), leaving aside typical cyber interactions . These overlooked interactions may include cases of deterrence success.\nThe research, then, not only tends to examine cases of deterrence failure, but also focuses on a limited number of cases. Methodologically, it is not clear to what extent these cases represent the general “population” of cases of cyber deterrence. For example, the reason that led to the availability of the case for deterrence scholars may also have affected the deterrence outcome. Given the secrecy that surrounds many cyberattack incidents, known cases of deterrence failures may indicate situations in which resolute actors chose to challenge.\n### The Dog That Did Bark\nThis problem concerns how scholars interpret observations: the challenge of establishing whether a certain case is a deterrence failure or success and thus of establishing the causal mechanism of deterrence failure/success. The secrecy around cyber incidents and the limited information available to scholars exacerbate the challenges in deterrence research (see also Burton 2018, 6; Healey and Jenkins 2019, 125). These challenges include actors’ tendency to see themselves as the defender (and not the challenger) and the difficulty of developing a more nuanced classification of deterrence success/failure: one that is not dichotomic but acknowledges that deterrence failure and deterrence success are on a continuum. In a similar way, a significant challenge is to determine what constitutes deterrence failure. While in the kinetic domains, scholars, practitioners, and law experts have over many years developed an understanding of this, it is still debated in the cyber domain (e.g., Schmitt 2017). This further complicates the academic community’s ability to interpret deterrence failure and success, and to classify cases.\nThe challenge of identifying relevant cases not only creates selection bias, but also complicates the ability to determine the impact of the deterrent threat on the putative challenger’s behavior. This difficulty is shaped by the combination of the limitation of available information on cyberattacks and the characteristics of cyberattacks, which make the temporality of the attack a key issue. In kinetic domains, the timing of the attack and of the damage is similar; and in most cases, damage follows shortly after the attack’s execution. For example, it takes a few minutes for an intercontinental missile to hit its target, and damage will follow and start impacting the defender usually less than an hour after the initiation of the attack. Because of the various modes and stages of executing cyberattacks, on the other hand, scholars have to distinguish between the timing of the attack and the timing of the damage (e.g., Brantly and Smeets forthcoming, 4–5). Challengers can better control the timing of the attack. They can predetermine the attack or use the original attack as a platform for future attacks. This increased difficulty in identifying the deterrent threat’s timing and its influence on the putative challenger’s behavior makes study of it much more onerous. Furthermore, it raises a crucial question about the meaning of deterrence success: that is, whether executing an attack can be considered deterrence failure if the damage has yet to occur. All of this inhibits our ability to interpret deterrence success or to classify cases of deterrence failure and success.\nAMIR LUPOVICI\n\nUnlike the previous two clusters of challenges, this problem mainly affects the study of cyber deterrence. While the dog that did not bark emphasizes the problems stemming from being unable to observe cases of deterrence success, this problem emphasizes problems stemming from being unable to clearly observe cases of deterrence failure.\nIn other domains, the execution of an attack leaves traces and evidence that scholars can use. These traces help scholars to determine the case as deterrence failure, as well as to examine aspects related to the execution of the challenge: for example, the damage, how it was done, and by whom. In contrast, cyberattacks usually leave fewer traces. In fact, even a significant cyberattack may not be easily traced. For example, a cyberattack may target the electricity grid but be masked as an accident or a failure of the system (see also Schneider 2019a, 114). Furthermore, in some cases, the effectiveness of cyberattacks requires that they will remain untraced. In the well-known case of Stuxnet, the worm aimed not only to damage Iranian centrifuges, but also to confuse the Iranian scientists regarding the sources of the problem.\nWhile the research on cyber deterrence focuses on the problem of attribution—a situation in which the source of an attack is unknown—a key difficulty concerns a more fundamental challenge: the ability to detect that there was an attack in the first place. Brantly, for example, notes that in the cyber domain it is more important “to identify that an attack is occurring... than to in the moment identify who is actually conducting the attack”. Moreover, regardless of whether or not the victim is aware of the attack, it is a challenge for scholars, who often have limited access to such information. For this reason, some scholars state their main focus is to study compelling success rather than deterrence success. Valeriano, Jensen, and Maness (2018, 24) suggest that “[o]ur choice to focus on compelling is driven by the need to examine the efficacy of operations that seek to achieve demonstrable effects. Compreciency is about changing behavior, while deterrence is about preventing behaviors, the latter being difficult to observe empirically.”\n# The Limitations of Current Solutions The solutions put forward to address challenges in studying deterrence have advanced deterrence research, but they have encountered some difficulties. Applying them to cyber deterrence studies, that focus on exploring deterrence success/failure, creates additional problems, given the unique characteristics of cyber deterrence and how knowledge around cyber incidents and cyber deterrence is produced. While common solutions may become more effective in the future, as technology changes and reliable information on cyber incidents increases, they are currently quite limited.\nOne direction for a solution is to acquire data and conduct quantitative studies based on it. While a few scholars have started to use these methods to examine cyber deterrence success or closely related behavior with interesting findings (e.g., Brantly 2016; Pytlak and Mitchell 2016),[12] they have also pointed to challenges in using data to this end (e.g., Valeriano, Jensen, and Maness 2018, 24). Others also indicate the need to develop new ways to use data given the challenges of studying this strategy.\nBecause of the challenges of studying cyber deterrence, it is difficult to employ the solutions discussed above based on careful selection of specific case studies—that is, focusing on critical case studies and immediate deterrence and exploring [12] For example, Brantly’s (2016, 143–49) findings support the assertions that actors’ ability to maintain anonymity enhances the chances for deterrence failure. Nonetheless, Pytlak and Mitchell are unable to establish significant correlation and in the end reach inconclusive interpretations of the evidence.\nA Methodology for Cyber Deterrence Research cases of deterrence failure as well as of deterrence success. These solutions cannot fully resolve the challenges of determining cyber incidents and identifying and classifying situations of cyber deterrence failure and success. Jervis (1989, 194) has warned that explaining deterrence failure and success is more important than explaining their frequency; this caution is even more important in studying cyber deterrence given that the cases scholars are able to examine are more biased. The challenges of case selection stem not only from the dog that did not bark problem, but also from the dog that did bark and the dog that should have barked problems—biasing cases both of deterrence success and of deterrence failure.\nLikewise, focusing on cases of immediate deterrence also becomes a challenge when studying cyber deterrence, mainly because of the lack of available information and the characteristics of cyberattacks themselves. Scholars must distinguish the time of the attack, the time of its damage, the time the defender acknowledges the attack (and the damage), and the time the attack becomes public knowledge.¹³ The defender itself may be unaware that it needs to employ an immediate deterrence threat. For example, in contrast to other domains, preparations for attacks in the cyber domain leave less traces compared to preparations of kinetic attacks and thus complicate the ability of deterrer actors to pose an immediate deterrent threat. This means that examining cases of immediate deterrence is of limited help in studying cyber deterrence: actors have fewer opportunities to perform this strategy, the existence of known cases of immediate cyber deterrence may be biased,¹⁴ and, most importantly, scholars may not have access to full information on these cases.\nSolutions put forward to better establish the causal connection between the deterrent threat and the challenger behavior face similar challenges. Along with the problems discussed (case selection and identification of deterrence failure and success, which also limit establishing the\"explanation\") is the limited available information on the case studies. This makes additional potential solutions impractical, such as the relying on primary sources. Likewise, while studying enduring rivals could address some of the challenges around establishing causal connections (as well as eliminating biases in case selection), it is questionable whether such enduring rivals and conflicts in the cyber domain exist, or whether scholars can acquire enough relevant information about them to allow such research. Cyber deterrence scholars, therefore, experience significant challenges because of difficulties identifying cases of deterrence success or failure. While these problems accompany the study of deterrence in general—both quantitative and qualitative works—they are worse in the study of cyber deterrence and intensify other challenges. Under these conditions, researchers need to go back to the same case studies, in this way possibly missing other important factors affecting the practices of deterrence.\n## Toward a Methodology for Studying Cyber Deterrence The challenges discussed above, and the limited applicability of current solutions to address them, increase the attractiveness of an alternative methodological solution to explore cyber deterrence. While, it is impossible to fully resolve all the challenges in the study of cyber deterrence, this article provides some directions toward this goal. I advance a solution based on studying the adoption of cyber deterrence strategy. By the adoption of cyber deterrence strategy, I refer to one of two things: (1) a strategic change, in which an actor moves toward a decision to rely on at least one type of cyber deterrence strategy (e.g., punishment, denial, detection), ¹³On policy decisions to reveal or conceal experiencing cyberattacks, see Baram and Sommer (2019).\n¹⁴Given how difficult it is for the defender to identify the need to issue an immediate cyber deterrence threat, the fact that a defender successfully identifies this need may itself affect its ability to issue a successful deterrent threat. Whereas in other domains the putative challenger may also attempt to disguise its attempt to attack, defender actors have more means to identify it prior to the attack.\nAMIR LUPOVICI Studying the adoption of deterrence strategies has not been given enough scholarly attention. Indeed, my exploration of this phenomenon overlaps with various studies on different types of deterrence strategies (e.g., nuclear, conventional).¹⁵ Some scholars, as noted above, have even started to specifically study cyber deterrence adoption. Nonetheless, few of these studies theorize this adoption, being more interested in the historical process through which deterrence was embraced.¹⁶ Furthermore, these scholars do not see research on adoption of the strategy as a methodological solution to challenges in studying deterrence.\nIn contrast, I suggest focusing on the adoption of deterrence strategy as a way to address the methodological challenges of studying (cyber) deterrence. Such a focus allows scholars to explore the various ways actors adopt this strategy and to apply different methods to ascertain this phenomenon and explain it. But before detailing the advantages of studying the adoption and employment of deterrence strategies, it is useful to categorize them. For example, the various ways actors adopt cyber deterrence strategies can be categorized based on the threat they aim to dissuade and their types, means, and degrees of explicitness.\n## The Undesired Activity to Be Deterred Actors can use cyber deterrence to deter threats not only in the cyber domain but also in other domains. In the former, the strategy of cyber deterrence can be used to deter different types of cyber threats that vary in intensity, complexity, and feasibility (e.g., Brantly 2016, 116–17; Burton 2018, 28–29). Brantly, for example, distinguishes three main categories of activities actors attempt to deter: cyberattacks, cyber espionage, and cyber theft.¹⁷ Defending actors may also develop a cross-domain deterrence strategy to dissuade threats conducted through cyber space that target supply chains or critical infrastructures or that may affect military activities and effectiveness.\nOther categories of employing cyber deterrence strategy concern the use of cyber means to dissuade attacks in kinetic domains. For example, cyber means may bolster conventional deterrence. In a similar way, cyber means may affect nuclear deterrence. Some scholars estimate that advances in artificial intelligence may undermine nuclear deterrence. However, others who study developments in Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA), including the advancement of autonomous machines and computerized devices, point to how in some situations these systems may enhance deterrence vis-à-vis different kinds of kinetic attacks (Fortmann and Von Hlatky 2009, 309–12).\nA related question about the type of threat is the specific phase of the cyberattack defenders wish to deter. Brantly and Smeets (forthcoming, 4–5) distinguish among different stages of cyberattack, such as the penetration of the defender’s system to ¹⁵ Some scholars indirectly refer to the adoption of the strategy while studying “deterrence success” as part of operationalizing deterrence threat. For example, in defining the issuing of an immediate extended deterrent threat, Huth and Russett argue that scholars need to focus on “observable behavioral indicators in the form of statements and military actions that signal the threat to use force if the protégé is attacked.” According to them, even if this is a bluff, it is part of practicing deterrence. However, their goal of operationalizing the issuing of the deterrent threat is to establish covariance as part of explaining deterrence success.\n¹⁶ This type of approach is clearly evident in Freedman and Michaels’ (2019) seminal book on the evolution of nuclear strategies in different periods of time and in different countries.\n¹⁷ In addition, scholars refer to more specific challenges, such as deterring the use of information warfare through cyber platforms.\nA Methodology for Cyber Deterrence Research install the means of attack and the execution of the attack to actually generate the damage.\n## Types of Deterrent Strategies Actors differ in what specific type of deterrent strategies, or combination of them, they adopt. Currently, in addition to deterrence by punishment, scholars tend to emphasize the following types of cyber deterrence strategies: tailored deterrence, punctuated/cumulative deterrence, deterrence by denial, deterrence by detection or by accusation, and deterrence by naming and shaming and through development of international norms.\n## The Deterrent Means Not only can actors adopt different types of cyber deterrence strategies, but they can also employ each strategy with different means. For example, deterrence by punishment may be based not only on the defender’s cyber means, but also on its economic, diplomatic, and kinetic means (e.g., Kugler 2009, 328; Jasper 2017, 95–96; Schneider 2019a). In a similar way, actors can employ deterrence by denial not only by communicating their defensive means, but also by communicating their means to avoid the damage, such as by establishing backup systems to ensure the resilience of the information infrastructures (see also Nye 2017, 57).\n## Degree of Explicitness Whether and how actors publicly declare they will respond to a challenge is fundamental to understanding these practices in any domain of conflict. Given the fact that communicating threats is a core element of deterrence strategy, the degree of explicitness is a key characteristic of how cyber deterrence strategy is adopted and employed. Deterrent threats are communicated through a wide spectrum of expressions—ranging from full explicitness to lack of any reference to the deterrent threat—that contain three main elements: One element is how the threat is articulated and directed at an opponent: for example, whether the threat is generally stated in a strategic document (e.g., Department of Defense 2011) or the defender targets specific opponents (e.g., Department of Defense 2018, 1).\nA second element is how explicitly the undesired activity the defender wants to prevent is communicated. Scholars have debated over this issue when studying deterrence in other domains, contemplating whether a red line should be clearly stated or not (e.g., Lockhart 1978, 548–51; Schelling 1981, 38–41).\nA third element is the extent to which the deterrent threat itself is communicated. Actors differ in how explicitly they present the consequences that will stem from the challenger’s undesired activity: whether, for example, the defender specifies the retaliatory punishment or only presents it generally. A number of US documents have stated that the United States preserves the right to retaliate against a cyberattack with all the means they hold (Department of Defense 2011, 2; Department of Defense 2013, 32, 41–42; see also in Healey 2019; and in Wilner 2020). While some argue that actors can achieve a deterrent effect by specifying what a retaliatory strike will include (to a specific challenger) (e.g., Kugler 2009, 331–32), others suggest that states often issue a more general threat, using ambiguity as a mechanism of deterrence (e.g., Brantly 2016, 114). Conversely, actors may refrain from explicitly AMIR LUPOVICI Other possibilities exist between full explicitness and non-explicitness in communicating deterrent threats. Kugler (2009, 311–3), for example, reviews key US documents since 2003 and concludes that while they acknowledge the need to develop cyber deterrence strategy, they do not elaborate on how it can be attained.¹⁸ Likewise, actors, such as in the Israeli case, may discuss the need to adopt a strategy of cyber deterrence or wish to develop such a strategy but refrain from directly and explicitly issuing deterrent threats. In the last decade, senior Israeli policymakers have made the point that Israel should acquire a cyber deterrence strategy. For example, when serving as minister of defense, Ehud Barak suggested that in the uncertainty that cyber capabilities create, “leadership is required to show the way as to how to do the right thing for Israel and to establish a deterrent balance”. Prime Minister Netanyahu also explained the need to develop a cyber deterrence strategy despite the fact that “[t]he ability to deter is more difficult because the source of such an attack is more anonymous. This is a problem we will certainly have to address”.\nInterestingly, in May 2020, it seems that Israel has moved to adopt an even more explicit cyber deterrence strategy when its retaliation against targets in Iran in response to a cyberattack on water infrastructures in Israel was reported. The publication of the Israeli retaliation, as well as other statements made by Israeli officials such as by Minister of Defense, Naftali Bennett, were interpreted as an attempt of Israel to send deterrent messages to the Iranians and to draw a red line (Siman Tov and Even 2020).\nSending deterrent messages through acts of retaliation is closely related to the concepts of punctuated deterrence and cumulative deterrence, where the actual use of force aims to punish and deliver a threatening message over a long period of time. Even before the incidents of May 2020, some experts interpreted Israel’s offensive cyber capabilities in this context, claiming they aim in part to deter potential challengers and “show potential attackers what Israel is able to do if it chooses to respond to an attack” (Cohen, Freilich and Siboni 2016, 313).\nSome degree of explicitness—and thus communication and signaling—is a crucial aspect of these practices. According to Kello (2017, 209), “Diplomatic and signaling procedures will be required to demonstrate to adversaries that for the purpose of punishment, individual hostile actions are regarded as a comprehensive package of offensive activity rather than being disparate actions that merit isolated responses.” Likewise, as Tor (2017, 107) asserts, just the use of force is insufficient in creating a cumulative cyber deterrent strategy, as there is also a need to “to outline the ‘rules of the game’ in a clear way.”¹⁹ ## Advantages in Focusing on Adoption of Cyber Deterrence Strategy Focusing on the adoption and employment of cyber deterrence has a number of theoretical and methodological advantages: it diversifies research by highlighting an overlooked phenomenon, it invites plural approaches and methods that help to better explain and understand actors’ behavior, and it thus emphasizes ¹⁸ In this respect, comparing US documents reveals a growing specification of cyber deterrence strategies over the years (e.g., in Kugler 2009, 311–13).\n¹⁹ Examples of less explicit messages that serve deterrent goals can be found in leaking of information around cyberattacks—such as Stuxnet, the corruption of Syria’s air defense system, the Chinese penetration of American health insurer files, and the Russian hack into the US Democratic Party files.\nA Methodology for Cyber Deterrence Research the importance of various strategic, normative, and cultural aspects related to this phenomenon. While to some extent these advantages could also be achieved by diverting the study around cyber deterrence failure/success to these directions, the main advantage lies in the observability that studying the adoption of the strategy allows. Not only does this advantage stand by its own in improving our understanding of the practices of cyber deterrence, but it also enhances the other advantages: diversification of the research and the use of plural methods.\n## Observability The main advantage of studying the adoption and employment of deterrence strategy is the ability to trace empirical evidence of it. The idea behind a strategy of deterrence, as discussed above, is to issue and communicate threats. The communication can be more or less explicit—and can even be a bluff; however, it is a crucial part of practicing this strategy.\nEven if the deterrent threat is a bluff,²⁰ the methodological solution based on studying the adoption and employment of (cyber) deterrent strategy cannot be dismissed based on an assertion that issuing deterrent threats is cheap talk. Given the cult of reputation and practitioners' worry about resolve (e.g., Tang 2005; Kertzer 2016),²¹ a defender may find it costly to not execute the deterrent threat or retaliate in case the undesired attack has been made by the putative challenger. They may fear that other actors will challenge them in the future because of the alleged demonstration of weakness. Actors thus are likely to take the adoption of cyber deterrence strategy and the issuing of deterrent threat seriously; issuing deterrent threats, therefore, provides indications of an actor's strategy.\nFocusing on observable indications allows scholars to address challenges in the study of cyber deterrence that stem from limited access to details around practicing cyber deterrence that in many cases remain unknown, such as the attack, the damage, and when the defender identified it was attacked. First, the problem of the dog that did not bark and the problem of the dog that should have barked become less pressing. Focusing on strategy adoption and the issuing of deterrent threat involves observing changes in the behavior of the defender actor. From this perspective, and as further discussed below, scholars can study nuances in strategy adoption, conduct comparisons among actors and over time, and explain this phenomenon regardless of the putative challenger's behavior or of the deterrence strategy outcomes. In other words, the research will not be biased toward studying specific cases of deterrence failure.\nStudying cyber deterrence strategy adoption also addresses challenges around the dog that did bark problem. By focusing mainly on the behavior of the defender actor, scholars have much less difficulty in interpretation, as the outcome to be examined and explained is less ambiguous. Indeed, scholars may debate over whether an actor actually adopted a cyber deterrence strategy, how it differs from its previous strategies, and about its specific elements. However, because adopting and employing a strategy of deterrence requires some degree of explicitness—unlike deterrence successes and even cyber deterrence failures—scholars also have much more access to empirical evidence to discuss and dispute.\n²⁰ Likewise, as Libicki (2016, 227) and Tor (2017, 107) note actors may deliver their deterrent messages not only in public channels but also in secret ones. While for scholars the delivering of deterrent messages secretly poses difficulties of observing and studying the occurrences, actors have incentives to make some public manifestations of the deterrent threat they issue, even indirectly, in order to target larger audiences. In addition, the focus of the suggested methodology is on the strategy, and not necessarily on the communication of a specific threat to a certain opponent. For example, in theory, a cyber deterrence strategy may be adopted explicitly, but the explicit strategic document may also acknowledge that in some situations the communication of the deterrent threat will be delivered privately.\n²¹ For further discussion of costly signals, cheap talk, and deterrence, see Fearon (2002, 13–16), Lupton (2018, 64), but also see Danilovic (2002, 130–40).\nIn addition, studying cyber deterrence strategy adoption makes more effective use of the methodological solutions traditional deterrence scholars offer to the challenges of exploring this strategy. First, scholars have pointed in different ways to the need to selectively choose case studies, such as studying critical cases of deterrence failure, or studying enduring rivals. While the main solution this article offers is somewhat different—focusing on the adoption/employment of the strategy—in fact, these solutions complement each other: for example, exploring the adoption, changes, and abandoning of cyber deterrence strategies over time between enduring rivals.\nOther solutions have aimed to better establish the causal mechanism (of deterrence success). Because of the observability of both cyber deterrence adoption and the elements that may account for it, the solution of developing specific hypotheses about the defender, the challenger, and the situation is useful direction to take. Scholars can observe the characteristics of cyber deterrence strategy adoption (e.g. explicitness, timing, the type of the cyber deterrence, the means to establish it, and the kind of challenge it aims to dissuade). In a similar way, scholars can provide various factors affecting such adoption, including elements of perceptions, culture, and norms on the one hand, and the strategic utility of the strategy on the other. Likewise, as further discussed below, they may explore the social context in which the strategy is embedded.\nFocusing on the adoption of the strategy is closely related to another solution advised by traditional deterrence scholars—that is, to rely on primary sources. Strategy adoption, being observable, provides sources to empirically establish the study of cyber deterrence. However, focusing on adoption also opens up other types of sources. Strategic documents establish the employment of the strategy, such as the US Department of Defense Cyberspace Policy Report, Department of Defense Defense Science Board, and the Department of Defense Cyber Strategy. Other relevant sources help to understand and explain how actors adopt cyber deterrence strategy, in this way exploring the various elements presented above. For example, primary documents that trace how perceptions on cyber (domain) change over time and how the cyber (domain) is constructed (e.g. in Raymond 2019, 203--35) could provide an account of changes in actors' willingness to employ this strategy in the cyber domain.\nThe methodological solution I propose—focusing on the adoption and employment of the strategy rather on deterrence success—provides important indications of actors' perceptions of the strategy's effectiveness. Scholars can explore specific cases and conduct longitudinal and cross-sectional comparisons of actors who adopt (or refrain from adopting) cyber deterrence strategy. For example, a growing international tendency to rely on this strategy may imply increasing effectiveness of the strategy or at least an increase in the perception of its effectiveness. Indeed, there are different explanations as to why actors adopt and employ a strategy of (cyber) deterrence—and these should be explored. Nonetheless, given the limited access to information about deterrence success, solutions based on focusing on the strategy's adoption provide important alternatives.\nTechnological developments provide one explanation (or hypothesis) for the adoption of cyber deterrence strategy. For example, given the problem of attribution, technologies that help defenders trace the source of an attack may enhance this strategy's efficiency and hence its attractiveness. In a similar way, improvements in defensive measures, measures to increase resilience, and organization skills in operating these measures may make strategies of deterrence by denial more attractive. While these are plausible hypotheses, we cannot reduce the adoption of (cyber) deterrence strategies to technological advancement. Other explanations could be developed, for example, A Methodology for Cyber Deterrence Research based on actors' (strategic) culture (e.g., Knopf 2013, 9–10).²³ A number of reviews of cyber security policies and strategies of different countries (e.g., Luijjf, Besseling, Spoelstra, and De Graaf 2013; Liveri and Sarri 2014; Baezner and Cordey 2019) provide not only the social context of cyber deterrence strategies, but also information to help explain their adoption (or lack thereof). The strategic, political, and cultural elements these reports review are useful points of departure toward that goal.\nInternational norms could also affect the adoption of cyber deterrence strategy. Nye, for example, suggests that deterrence through the establishment of international norms is one means of employing cyber deterrence. This strategy is based on creating taboos that increase the costs of attacking certain cyber targets (e.g., civilian cyber infrastructures). From this perspective, the emergence of norms incentivizes actors to rely on practices of deterrence and adopt and employ them. Furthermore, the emergence of new norms can also affect other types of deterrence strategy, including deterrence by punishment. Actors may be more motivated to adopt such a strategy, for example, if cyberattacks are constructed as acts of violence. Seeing a challenge as “violent” increases an actor’s willingness to employ threats to dissuade it, thus enhancing deterrence effectiveness. The existence of a norm that portrays cyberattacks in this way legitimizes a retaliatory strike and thus the adoption of this strategy in the first place.²⁴ In recent years, scholars have begun to explore how public perceptions of cyber conflicts and dynamics affect support for retaliation against cyberattacks. Public attitudes open up a broad area for research connecting normative, political, and institutional factors that also affect the adoption of cyber deterrence strategies.\n## Diversifying Cyber Deterrence Research By focusing on the strategy’s adoption, we can examine and compare various kinds of actors, especially actors other than those commonly examined. In particular, the United States is overrepresented in the research. There are a number of reasons for this—including that many scholars are American and aim to influence the US strategy, that the United States is considered a cyber power, and the greater availability of American documents. Therefore, US cyber deterrence will probably continue to be closely examined.\nHowever, the observability of the adoption and employment of the strategy makes information on other cases also relatively accessible, which may help to fill the gap and advance our understanding of other countries. One of the research puzzles concerns actors who have not adopted an explicit cyber deterrence strategy—Israel being a key example. Despite the fact that deterrence is a strategy Israel has adopted vis-à-vis various threats, so far Israel has refrained from issuing direct cyber deterrent threats.\nDiversifying the research to include other states is also intriguing given the differing views on the strategy of deterrence and cyber security. Studying whether and how these actors adopt and employ cyber deterrence strategies helps to develop a more nuanced understanding of what cyber deterrence is and why and how it is used.\nWe can also extend the study of cyber deterrence to explore non-state actors. In recent years, deterrence scholarship has started to acknowledge other actors involved in the practices of deterrence (Paul, Morgan, and Wirtz 2009). Scholars have explored not only how states attempt to deter non-states threats (e.g., Wilner 2015, 37–74), but also how different kinds of non-state actors, such as terrorist ²³I discuss below some more specific cultural explanations for adopting a strategy of deterrence.\n²⁴For further discussion on the question of “violence,” use of force, cyberattacks, and legitimate retaliation, see Waxman (2011), Harrison Dinniss (2012, 63–75), Schmitt (2017, chapter 14, 16), and Schneider (2019a, 115).\nAMIR LUPOVICI\n\n## Inviting Plural Research Methods\nThe study of the adoption and employment of cyber deterrence strategies invites positivist and interpretative methods. Positivist scholars can study causal mechanisms of this phenomenon through quantitative and qualitative methods. Scholars can focus on specific case studies or conduct longitudinal and cross-sectional comparative works on actors who adopted, were late to adopt, or did not adopt cyber deterrence strategy.\nFocusing on adoption is a promising direction for examining whether, how, and why an actor adopts and employs a certain type of cyber deterrence strategy. One option is to explore the evolution of the strategy: for example, by tracing a shift in a state’s cyber strategy. The changes in 2018 in US cyber policy provide a useful demonstration of these dynamics, illustrating the advantages of the suggested framework. In 2018, the United States adopted a cyber strategy based on *defend forward* and *persistent engagement* (e.g., compare Department of Defense 2011 with Department of Defense 2018; see also Healey 2019; Kosseff 2019, 5; Wilner 2020, 266–67). While there is debate over how far this strategy diverts from an emphasis on deterrence, experts ascribe the shift to the limited applicability of deterrence strategy in the cyber domain (e.g., Fischerkeller and Harknett 2017; see also King and Gallagher 2020, 27–28).²⁵\nThis policy change led to some interesting questions. Foremost, the timing of this shift is worth exploring. Doubts over the effectiveness of cyber deterrence strategy were expressed as early as the 1990s. This implies that the 2018 change was informed by notions beyond those of the limitations of cyber deterrence strategy—for example, by the acknowledgment that adversaries in cyber space are in constant contact (e.g., Fischerkeller and Harknet 2017; Fischerkeller, Harknett, and Vičić 2020, 25–30). This shows that acceptance of new ideas and their successful promotion by individuals and networks may also be crucial in accounting for this change. Healey suggests that the change “stems directly from this Goldman–Fischerkeller–Harknett lineage (and subsequently drove the DoD Cyber Strategy and parts of the White House National Cyber Strategy). This is perhaps unsurprising “as all three are international relations scholars who have worked at US Cyber Command” . Processes of learning, persuasion, and individual characteristics can all help to explain whether and how cyber deterrence strategy is shifting, accepted, and employed.²⁶\nLearning may be also seen as a result of cyberattacks experienced by the United States, which led practitioners to emphasize the need to shift to persistent engagement. Whyte (2020a, 210–11) summarizes this point: “[N]umerous commentators . . . note the significance of Russian political warfare in 2016 as a realisation mo\n²⁵ Likewise, Libicki concludes that the United States should not make cyber deterrence an explicit strategy and that it should not rely on it .\n²⁶ For similar dynamics regarding learning nuclear deterrence, see Kaplan (1991), Adler (1992), and Evangelista (1999). These studies show, in different ways, that although technological developments are crucial, they are insufficient to account for the adoption of deterrence strategies.\nA Methodology for Cyber Deterrence Research\nment prompting the development of the new, more assertive strategy.” Structural changes also allowed for and guided this shift. For example, comparing the 2018 cyber strategy with its predecessor , Kollars and Schneider (2018) note “The 2018 Cyber Strategy reflects the changes in the political, technical, and institutional environment over the last three years.”\nAnother research direction that focuses on the adoption of the strategy could examine the exact nature, rather the efficiency, of the strategy²⁷: that is, examining whether and which type of deterrence strategy the new adopted policy aims to advance. Scholars have debated over whether the 2018 strategy emphasizes deterrence strategy (see, Healey 2019, 3–4). On the one hand, it was developed and justified based on the limits of cyber deterrence as discussed above. For example, Kreps and Schneider (2019, 9) assert that persistent engagement is better suited than deterrence. According to them, “[D]eterrence hinges on public resolve for overwhelming uses of force and a willingness to escalate, which appears lacking in the cyber domain, whereas persistent engagement can operate at a lower intensity of confrontation—albeit one that is relatively continuous—that gains legitimacy by virtue of the public support.”\nNonetheless, while experts acknowledge the shift in the US strategy, they also point to different types of deterrence strategy that the new policy emphasizes and to how it might actually enhance the US deterrent posture. For Whyte (2020a, 210), the new strategy marks a shift from deterrence by denial to a kind of deterrence by punishment. Likewise, Kollars and Schneider (2018) identify a specific shift in US strategy toward tailored deterrence against China and Russia, compared with a former comprehensive cyber deterrence strategy vis-à-vis a “wide array of actors and actions.” Furthermore, persistent engagement based on offensive action might strengthen deterrence strategy by signaling resolve and establishing escalation dominance . In a similar way, the US Cyber Command Vision statement implements the idea of persistent engagement as a way to enhance the US deterrent posture. According to this document, “Through persistent action and competing more effectively below the level of armed conflict, we can influence the calculations of our adversaries, deter aggression, and clarify the distinction between acceptable and unacceptable behavior in cyberspace” .\nThese discussions demonstrate not only the importance of looking into a cyber (deterrence) strategy, explaining it, and analyzing its components, but also the feasibility of conducting such research. Although, scholars can interpret the evidence differently, and the meaning and implications of the strategy may change over time, there is accessible and important evidence to work with. Furthermore, it helps to demonstrate how the suggested methodology provides an alternative to the challenges of studying deterrence success. While we still have little information about the outcomes of this strategy, we can start by considering the various aspects of its adoption.\nIn addition to focusing on one case study or on shifts in actors’ cyber deterrence strategy, such as the those discussed above (the case of Israel response in May 2020 and the 2018 US policy), scholars can also conduct broader comparisons. These can explore the reasons for the differences in how countries adopt and employ cyber deterrence strategies or compare an actor’s adoption and employment of cyber deterrence strategy with its adoption and employment of deterrence strategy\n²⁷ The idea of persistent engagement sparked a debate over whether and to what extent cyber operations are effective in attaining strategic goals, and specifically whether and how they contribute to cyber deterrence success. While scholars acknowledged a number of advantages of the new policy, they were also worried that the criteria for success of this new strategy are not entirely clear; that employing it might be too costly; that it might lead to escalation; and that it may deteriorate US relationships with its allies .\nAMIR LUPOVICI\n\nAn obvious advantage here is the access to comparable information and data. Scholars, thus, not only can conduct quantitative research that explores different aspects of the adoption of cyber deterrence strategies, but can also use data sets already available. This direction accords with Pytlak and Mitchell’s (2016, 79) recommendation to develop new techniques to address and use data in a way that overcomes the limited “amount of information publicly available.”\nBased on the data collected and analyzed by Brantly (2016), Valeriano, Jensen, and Maness (2018), and Kostyuk and Zhukov (2019), scholars are able to develop interesting notions about the adoption of deterrence strategy. For example, following these studies, it is possible to ask whether actors who absorbed significant cyberattacks tend to consider adopting cyber deterrence strategies to balance their insecurities, or whether more powerful actors tend to rely on this strategy, for example, based on long-term deterrence through previous execution of cyber means (i.e., cumulative cyber deterrence).²⁹ These notions fit some of the assertions Valeriano et al. make, such as those about credibility and signaling (Valeriano, Jensen, and Maness 2018, 46–47), as well as about the long-term aims of cyber operations (Valeriano, Jensen, and Maness 2018, 11). Similarly, the cyber power score Brantly (2016, 138–40, 169) develops enables some hypotheses about the adoption of cyber deterrence strategies: for example, whether weaker states tend to adopt deterrence strategies to balance their inferiority (e.g., explicitly adopt the strategy) or to avoid it, fearing that adopting it will contribute to escalation. Based on these data, scholars can also compare whether and why different actors adopt different types of cyber deterrence strategies: for example, whether weaker actors rely on strategies such as deterrence by naming and shaming or deterrence by detection.\nThe suggested methodology based on studying the adoption of the strategy not only enables positivistic studies, but may also fit well with interpretative frameworks and research on deterrence. Interpretative scholars who study deterrence have started to employ discourse analysis to examine the practices of deterrence. While these methods have not been fully applied to study cyber deterrence, this could be done through focusing on the adoption and employment of the strategy and on the language used. One specific promising direction is to study the adoption and employment of deterrence as securitizing moves. Scholars have started to explore different securitizing moves related to cyber (Bendrath, Eriksson, and Giacomello 2007; Dunn Cavelty 2008; Hansen and Nissenbaum 2009; Deibert and Rohozinski 2010; Dunn Cavelty 2013; Stevens 2016). Looking into the adoption of cyber deterrence strategy provides intriguing cases to further apply the theory of securitization to traditional security challenges. This direction may cover various securitizing moves: for example, the American attempt to securitize cyber challenges to justify various means of retaliation, including even nuclear weapons, in the case of an “existential cyber attack” (Department of Defense 2013, 42; see also Wilner 2020, 261).\nIn a similar way, interpretative approaches highlight the importance of the social context in which deterrence strategy is embedded. These notions can be also ap- ²⁸ One goal of comparing cyber deterrence with deterrence in other domains is to validate the assertion that the adoption of cyber deterrence may indicate, even indirectly, deterrence success, as discussed above.\n²⁹ Likewise, reports that document cyber incidents may also prove useful in tracing previous cyber operations and their influence on actors’ adoption of cyber deterrence strategies; see, for example, the project of the Council on Foreign Relations at https://www.cfr.org/cyber-operations.\nA Methodology for Cyber Deterrence Research plied to study cyber deterrence: for example, in examining how the strategy's adoption and employment are shaped by international norms, (strategic) culture, and actors' identity. This is important to better understand how and why actors adopt cyber deterrence strategies, but also because the way the strategy is adopted indicates and reflects political, normative, and cultural elements. Although scholars have not used these elements to study cyber deterrence adoption (but see Adamsky 2018), they have explained deterrence strategy adoption and employment in other domains by pointing to strategic culture, norms, practices, rituals (Mälksoo 2021), and actors' identity, emotions, and ontological security. The adoption and employment of cyber deterrence strategy provide another arena to examine and employ these theories.\n# Conclusions This article suggests that focusing on the adoption and employment of cyber deterrence strategy—rather than studying cyber deterrence success—promises to provide solutions to the methodological challenges associated with the study of this strategy. This article does not claim to advance the only way to explore cyber deterrence. On the contrary, scholars may well find methodological alternatives, as there is still need to collect and analyze data and case studies on deterrence failure/success. Nonetheless, based on clarifying methodological challenges and by offering a categorization of different characteristics of how (cyber) deterrence strategies are adopted, I point to a phenomenon that has received insufficient attention, and studying it carries a number of advantages. Among other things, it provides methodological solutions, it helps diversify the research of deterrence, and it invites plural approaches and methods. This paper thus should be seen as a point of departure for further research and as a call to focus on the adoption and employment of the strategy.\nMore generally, I suggest that elaborating on these issues contributes not only to the study of cyber deterrence, but also to the two fields of research: deterrence and cyber. For the former, the advantage lies in reframing methodological problems and challenges that may be relevant for scholars who explore not only cyber deterrence. Another advantage for deterrence research, in general, lies in studying an understudied phenomenon. More scholarly work has been done on the adoption and employment of deterrence strategies (mainly of nuclear deterrence, e.g., Kaplan 1991; Adler 1992; Evangelista 1999; Freedman and Michaels 2019) than on the adoption of cyber deterrence strategies. Nonetheless, while the study of deterrence strategy adoption lags behind the study of deterrence success, it may well complement it. From this perspective, this article provides a first step in developing a methodology to study the adoption and employment of different types of deterrence strategies in different domains and with different deterrent means.\nThis is, furthermore, an important phenomenon on its own. It may indicate various aspects about actors' strategic thinking, perceptions, culture, and identity. Understanding how, when, and why actors adopt and employ deterrence strategies (or change or abandon them) in various domains may also further the study of cyber deterrence adoption and employment. The study of more traditional strategies of deterrence may reveal additional explanations and possible characteristics to examine, explain, and compare. Conversely, studying the adoption of cyber deterrence may advance the study of more traditional strategies of deterrence. Most notably, studying cyber deterrence emphasizes that adoption of deterrence strategies cannot be taken as given but requires explanation. It also reveals our assumptions in studying deterrence. For example, traditional studies of deterrence take as given that the challenge is an act of violence or that the timing of the attack and the tim AMIR LUPOVICI Regarding cyber studies, exploring the strategy's adoption may account for changes in actors' behavior. In other words, studying cyber deterrence adoption demonstrates how technological and normative changes affect cyber strategies. In a similar way, we can study how culture, on the one hand, and rational calculations, on the other hand, affect behavior in the cyber domain. Studying cyber deterrence adoption makes cyber behavior more observable. Therefore, we can draw implications from it that go beyond those related solely to deterrence.\n## Acknowledgments I would like to thank Patricia Greve, Gallia Lindenstrauss, and the three anonymous reviewers for their extremely helpful comments and suggestions on different drafts of this manuscript.
