Specific and the Commitment of State Responsibility\nVasile COMAN\nTitu Maiorescu University, Romania\nFaculty of Law, Bucharest\nLaw Doctoral School\nPrahova Court, Romania\nCriminal section, Ploiești\nv.comann@yahoo.com\n# Abstract:\nDue to their worrying presence, cyber attacks pose new challenges to states, both nationally and between states, and are almost non-existent during recent military conflicts. Global peace requires at the legal and practical level a firm reaction against their use, but with the observance of rules and limits of the intensity of the force used, including the real need and proportionality.\nThe study seeks to establish some guidelines under the mentioned aspects, far from being widely accepted in current legal and political doctrines, and can be a starting point in developing a predictable legislative framework effective, effective in action and decisive in preserving the real sense of security individual and collective.\nKeywords: cyber attacks; war; armed conflict; responsibility; state.\n# I. Introduction\nThe presence of cybernetics in the modern life of states is a reality that can no longer be ignored, bringing undeniable benefits to people's well-being, but being accompanied by certain risks, the most important of which is the use of technological advantages for criminal or illicit purposes in general. The risk is real and it can already be seen empirically that in the case of recent armed conflicts (for example, the Russia-Ukraine conflict that began on February 24, 2022), the cyber component is not only used consistently, but is and targeted by attacks of the same nature by combatants.\nIt is important to note that, while the term \"cyber attack\" is often used in the literature, to date, all but a few effects of offensive cyber operations have remained below the level considered to be the use of force or armed attack, within the meaning of the provisions of the United Nations Charter. Moreover, malicious cyber activity can take place over an extended period of time - months, if not years - and is often not detected. For this reason, such activity is therefore better described as \"cyber operations\" than as \"attack.\"1.\nIn the military and international law, there are heated discussions about possible situations in which cyber attacks can be qualified as acts of war in themselves, especially when they take place during actual armed attacks. However, it is true that the increasing emergence of cyber attacks and the introduction of new technologies in the military and electronics industry have led to a fundamental change in the features that previously characterized acts of pure kinetic warfare, so it may seem necessary to adapt the law of war and international humanitarian law. which must evolve just as fast2.\nJournal of Law and Public Administration\nVolume VIII, Issue 15, 2022\n## II. Cyber Attacks. Specific and content\nIn order to keep the internet safe and peaceful, it is vital to establish the constitutive content of cyber attacks, the manner of manifestation and the targets primarily targeted, so that they can be recognized when they occur or, ideally, in time.\nIdentifying the real actors behind a cyber attack is a notoriously difficult task, which increases exponentially in the event of an armed conflict. Attributing attacks to individual actors (states or international organizations, or private actors) is traditionally seen as an acid test to determine whether an attack is assessed as an act of cyber warfare that complements kinetic warfare, or just an act. conjunctural of cyber terrorism (\"cyber hooliganism\").\nCyber attribution is the act of tying together cyber activities in such an aggression, based on their attributes, to determine if they come from the same actor, the most difficult part being determining the motivation of the latter³. The logical attribution process consists of 4 steps: a) Discovering the indicators of compromise of the attacked systems - by administering evidence of unauthorized activity in a network or organization, b) Associating them together as belonging to specific actors based on their attributes, c) Precise identification of the actor, d) determination of the actor's motivation⁴.\nThe assignment process can target a particular unit, organization, or even individual behind the cyber activity. The award process is particularly important in this situation, in which, without identity and motivation, it is not possible to know who the enemy is and, implicitly, how to be annihilated with an active or passive response, tactical or technical, from the victim state⁵.\nUnlike weapons of mass destruction, cyber attacks are \"weapons of mass iritation\"⁶ and can cause a \"computer pandemic,\" and in the event of an armed conflict, they are non-physical in nature.\nCyber attacks are generally non-public and usually target government or private institutions, usually major financial institutions affecting public confidence in Internet-mediated transactions, severely disrupting their critical infrastructure and security architecture⁷.\nAmong the most publicized in recent years are cyber attacks in the 2008 Russia-Georgia conflict⁸, cyber attacks on Estonia in 2007 (the most important recent cyber war, which was led by a group of young pro-Kremlin⁹), the military operation of Russia in Chechnya, which have shown that computer systems are an important component of future wars, so concrete legislative measures are needed to limit and eliminate attacks in this area.\nDuring an armed conflict, the cybernetic component unequivocally plays a key role, disrupting the electronic communication systems of combat units; it is a quasi-official part of the military war strategies developed by states.\nJens David; Govern, Kevin; Finkelstein, Claire (2015), Cyberwar. Law and Ethics for Virtual Conflicts, Oxford: Oxford University Press, United Kingdom, pp. 16-17.\n³ Oakley, Jacob G. (2019), Waging cyberwar. technical challenges and operational constraints, New York: Apress Publishing, USA, pp. 114.\n⁴ For details on the steps to be taken in cyber attack, see Oakley, Jacob G., op.cit., pp. 116-130.\n⁵ Moreover, the award decision must weigh operationally other concerns, political ramifications, strategic impacts and even moral dilemmas.\n⁶ Carr, Jeffrey (2012), Inside Cyber Warfare. Mapping the cyberunderworld, Sebastopol, California: O'Reilly Media Inc., p. 8.\n⁷ Covert cyber actions can be of two general types: (1) propaganda and misinformation that would be the subject of psychological operations to manipulate the evolution of the real armed conflict; and, (2) actions to shut down the computer networks of the target countries\n⁸ On the cyber side of the war in Georgia, coordinated by www.stopGeorgia.info (located in Germany) and www.stopGeorgia.ru (located in the USA), see, José Rios, Maria; Tenreiro de Magalhães, Sérgio; Santos, Leonel, The Georgia's cyberwar, available at www.researchgate.net. The attacks consisted mainly of SQL Injection and DDoS actions.\n⁹ The immediate cause of the cyber attacks on Estonia was the Estonian government's decision to move a war memorial of the Soviet Army from central Tallinn, the capital of Estonia. Many Estonians see the memorial as a harsh reminder of the former Soviet Union's \"occupation\" of Estonia, while many Russians see the statue as a memorial to the Red Army's sacrifices in liberating Estonia from Nazi Germany.\nJournal of Law and Public Administration\nVolume VIII, Issue 15, 2022\nThere are multi-national private hackers (nonstate hackers or patriotic hackers) secretly hired by states to move the real origin and responsibility for plausible deniability, while they enjoy the results of the attackers and support them. these by providing the necessary resources¹⁰.\nThus, in times of armed conflict or political tension between states, some members of a state's citizens may be motivated to support the country's war or political effort by taking direct action on the cyber component of the enemy involved in the conflict. Hackers (\"patriotic hackers\") are private citizens qualified in cyber attack capabilities, who can initiate a cyber attack against another state on their own. They may do so without the consent, direction or control of the State to which they belong or in whose territory they are located¹¹. However, there have been incidents in which it is suspected that hacktivists were encouraged and aided by the state, being used as proxies (eg the 2007 cyber attack on Estonia, attributed by the West to Russia)¹².\nRegardless of the origin of the perpetrator, cyber attacks in the context of an armed conflict can have the following objectives:\na) Exposing current realities (eg in 2008 in the context of the Israeli-led war against Palestine, Israeli hackers penetrated Palestinian TV and radio stations, inserting scenes with the death of Palestinian leaders).\nb) Implement malicious attack programs on unmanned military drones (eg Conficker C virus) frequently used in armed conflict, compared to the reality that military units understand the strategic and tactical need for unmanned aerial systems (UAS), making them an integral part of their arsenal of monitoring or even attacking the enemy¹³.\nb) The paralysis of the targeted websites for certain periods of time and the blocking of the normal activity of some critical institutions of the state, with indirect consequences on the public services, including of some smaller businesses / firms; attackers can change the language used by the attacked sites or the IP address (eg in the 2008 Gaza war - the \"cast lead\" operation), or post messages against the war or with the dead violence.\nc) indirectly causing material damage to the institutions or legal or even natural persons concerned - even by restricting regular access to the Internet, by attacks on governmental (political¹⁴) or commercial sites, or by silencing political opponents.\nFor example, in the 2009 elections in Iran, when the government decided to shut down the internet in the country in order to stop the massive protests of election fraud, carried out through Facebook and Twitter, in a context in which hackers from opposition parties would have launched DDoS attacks on government sites.\nd) collecting relevant data sought by penetrating networks, including by creating fictitious pages (phishing) or fictitious groups on social networks - communication (eg, Facebook, Telegram) to influence the mood of the population concerned.\nThe purpose is to shape and control public opinion about how events actually unfolded by DDoS, SQL Injection, or Crosssite scripting (XSS) attacks on government sites (Government, Banks, Parliament, Ministries, Lines). communication, embassy websites)\n¹⁰ We emphasize that international law presupposes that armed conflict is initiated only by states (as subjects of law) and not by groups or individuals.\n¹¹ Demonstrating a link between non-state actors, hacktivists and the beneficiary government can be difficult, sometimes impossible or takes too long to confirm that the competent legal authority of the target state can take swift response.\n¹² As we will see in the section on the attribution and imputability of cyber attacks, according to international law, if patriotic hackers carry out a cyber attack against another state that rises to the level of an \"armed attack\", the victim state has the legal right, acting inself-defense, to use force against those hackers.\n¹³ From missiles armed with missiles or bombs to so-called traditional ammunition drones (also known as kamikaze drones), this unmanned technology completes many new challenges and opens up a whole new set of possibilities for armed forces around the world.\n¹⁴ Politically motivated cyber attacks range in sophistication, from small-scale denial of simple attacks to well-organized and covert espionage attacks. The sophistication of a cyber attack depends on the skill of the attackers and the amount of reconnaissance performed before the attack. For considerations regarding cyber warfare capabilities in Australia, Brazil, Canada, North Korea, Estonia, Czech Republic, France, Germany, India, Iran, Israel, Italy, Kenya, NATO, China, Pakistan, etc. - see Carr, Jeffrey, op.cit., pp. 243 - 262. An example of a political attack is during the 2009 Nigerian elections to control election information.\nJournal of Law and Public Administration\nVolume VIII, Issue 15, 2022\ne) for recognizing and imposing a supremacy between cyber hackers, taking advantage of the context of kinetic conflict. For example, during the 2006-2008 Gaza war (eg Team Evil, Cold Zero, - formats for resistance to the Gaza war).\nThis notoriety can also occur through the acquisition of cyber attacks during major social crises or key moments in society (eg presidential elections, change of political regime). Among those known, Team Hell - a group of hackers with political or religious orientations, Agd_Scorp, Jurm Team, C-H Team, Gaza Hacker Team, DNS Team, DZ Team, etc. were mentioned in the literature¹⁵.\nf) to transmit signals of the cyber capacity of a state, to other states in conflict or competition (eg in 2009, on the day of the USA were attacked several strategic sites, of some government institutions and of some private companies - which carries out contracts with the state on military projects, in this sense being suspected North Korea).\ng) the insertion of sophisticated viruses in the target computers, for the exploitation of resources or the search for classified information, and if the compromised computer system is part of a larger network, the attacker obtains access to the main network; it takes advantage of the fact that antivirus technology simply cannot keep pace with known threats, much less those they are unaware of¹⁶.\nIn the case of armed (kinetic) conflicts, the targets of interest (cyber bullets) include hubs and other crucial links in the system that move enemy troops involved in the war, such as ports, airports, means of transport, battlefield facilities and communications. Targets could include computer systems located in the enemy state or abroad, command and control nodes, spatial information, surveillance, and means of recognition and communication, command, control and information systems.\nOne such example is cyber attacks on tanks used in a pending military operation, in which a state may have a cyber weapon capable of harming its enemy's tanks. Tanks are equipped with computerized weapon systems in today's armies and could be susceptible to cyber attacks¹⁷. A single cyber weapon may be able to stop the controls of the electric motor or the tank, virtually eliminating it from combat. Another cyber weapon can attack the warhead reinforcement system or the targeting system for the same purpose. Both effects are considered cyber attacks.\nPredictably, cyber attacks will target telecommunications infrastructure (e.g., a virus designed to shut off power to military installations), transportation infrastructure, secure networks, the economy, energy (generating blackouts), security breaches, and disabling security breaches. programs to protect the targeted systems, sometimes leaving graffiti behind in the attacked sites (containing information about certain exposed individuals) or on the main page, the online banking payment systems.\nAs a way of action, hack tek strategies are developed by organized crime in cyber underground labs and usually start by attacking individual servers or computers by infecting with Trojan viruses, such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)¹⁸ and SQL Injection.\nThe more advanced the technology, the more attacks appeared in forms not previously covered by official statements and state practices.\nCyber attacks come in many different forms, their destructive potential being limited only by the creativity and skill of the attackers behind them, and usually a kinetic attack is combined with a support cyber attack. Although it may seem intuitive that cyberattacks may constitute armed attacks, especially in light of their indirect ability to injure or kill, the legal\n¹⁵ For details on the profile of these groups of hackers and their guidelines, see Carr, Jeffrey, op.cit., pp. 22-27.\n¹⁶ Often, the selection of the target is given two main considerations: the value of the information that will be obtained and the difficulty of success in operation (to exclude the probability of detection).\n¹⁷ The same goes for intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). ICBM launchers are developed within the limits of state secrecy and can essentially hit anywhere in the world in the execution of an attack. Although countermeasures capable of intercepting ICBMs have been developed, some states, such as Russia and North Korea, have recently announced that they have developed models that cannot be intercepted at this time (eg Sarmat / Satan 2, in the case of Russia).\n¹⁸ DDoS attacks typically disrupt communications and computing capabilities by sending huge amounts of (sometimes malformed) traffic to devices to alter or deny their ability to function as originally intended. They are common on the Internet because they are relatively unsophisticated and can be targeted from an Internet presence point in the cyberspace of one state against one in another enemy state.\nJournal of Law and Public Administration\nVolume VIII, Issue 15, 2022\ncommunity has been reluctant to take this approach, as cyberattacks do not resemble traditional armed attacks with conventional weapons, having another specific manifestation¹⁹.\nThe exploitation of computer systems in cyber warfare is, in fact, an exploitation of the human errors of those who thought and built them into their elements - ways of exploiting, reconfiguring or overwriting computer programs (eg, a virtual gateway which uses facial recognition is altered, nullifying the image component, or a cyber attack that corrupts the hard disks of the surveillance cameras where their recordings are stored, or the steering systems of some devices engaged in kinetic warfare).\n## III. Establishing the responsibility of the state for cyber attacks carried out on its territory\nStates may not respond to a cross-border cyber attack by force without first establishing the State's responsibility for the attack. Although historically this has meant that an attack has taken place, to be attributed to a state or its agents, direct control of an attack is no longer a requirement of state responsibility. Today, international law is based on the responsibility of a state and only on the breach of its international obligations to prevent and combat it.\nThis change is particularly important for cyber attacks, as the prevailing view is that cross-border cyber attacks should be treated as a criminal matter rather than a national security issue, and this seems to be based on the historical view of state responsibility. This limited view of state responsibility blocks attacked states in the response crisis by requiring states to attribute cyber attacks to a state or its agents before responding through active defenses, even if the likelihood of successfully assigning a ranged attack is generally uncertain. Consequently, states in crisis in response to a cyber attack act under the false assumption that they must decide between effective but illegal active defenses and the less effective but legal path of passive defenses and the scope of domestic criminal law.\nGiven the perspective of state responsibility, states should first determine whether the cyber attack can be blamed on the home state. Once a cyber attack is blamed on a state and that state refuses to comply with its international obligations, the legal barriers to self-defense action disappear.\nWith regard to cyber attacks, the accepted principles of common *jus ad bellum* still support the imputation of state responsibility for armed attacks by non-state actors when the attacks come from a state that allows non-state actors to carry out criminal operations within their borders. States that allow non-state actors to carry out these operations are in breach of their duty to prevent attacks on other states and are known as \"sanctuary states\". This is extremely important for cyber-attack states because when a cyber-attack comes from a sanctuary state, a victim-state can use active defenses and avoid crisis response.\nTherefore, we need to understand the answers to two key questions:\n- What does a state's duty to prevent cyber attacks mean?\nThis obligation in fact includes several smaller tasks to prevent cyber attacks, including the adoption of strict criminal laws, the vigorous enforcement of investigative procedures, the prosecution of attackers and, during the investigation and prosecution, cooperation with cyber-attack states. These are the duties of all states and are binding as customary international law. The authority for these duties comes from all three sources of international tradition in the field of law - international conventions, international customs and general principles of law common to civilized nations, as evidenced by the judgments and teachings of the most qualified international lawyers.\nThe only international treaty analogous to cybernetics is the European Convention on Cybercrime in 2001²⁰. Although the treaty is only a regional agreement, it is still very influential on customary international law because of the importance of the states that have ratified it, originating from the doctrine of the states particularly affected.\n---\n¹⁹Unlike conventional warfare, an autonomous and exclusive act of warfare in the cyber realm is difficult to conceive.\n²⁰Available at www.eur-lex.europa.eu.The Cybercrime Convention requires its parties to establish \"criminal\" offences for almost every conceivable type of cyber attack, in accordance with their domestic law.\nJournal of Law and Public Administration\nVolume VIII, Issue 15, 2022\nIn addition, it demonstrates the recognition by states of both the need to criminalize cyber attacks and the obligation of states to prevent their territory from being used by non-state actors to conduct cyber attacks against other states. The convention is also significant because it recognizes that cyber attacks cannot be banned during an attack, and the only way to prevent them is through aggressive law enforcement, coupled with state cooperation.\nInternational Terrorist Terrorism Treaties provide additional, albeit indirect, support for the duty to prevent cyber attacks. The international community recognizes terrorism as a threat to international peace and security, but no agreement has been reached on a definition. As a result, states have increasingly taken the approach of outlawing certain acts of terrorism - terrorists are constantly developing new methods of attack, rather than outlawing terrorism itself.\nThese treaties impose on states several common requirements regarding terrorist attacks, such as taking all practicable measures to prevent such attacks, criminalizing attacks, referring cases to the competent authorities for prosecution, and obliging states to cooperate with each other during criminal proceedings[21]. Although these treaties do not address cyber attacks, the principles contained therein contribute to influencing state requirements under customary international law on terrorism. As there is growing evidence that cyberattacks will soon be an active weapon for terrorists, states should refer to the common principles found in these treaties as opinio juris when cyberattacks are used as a terrorist weapon.\n- What must a state do to avoid violating its duty to prevent?\nThe treatment of cyber attacks in accordance with their criminal law also proves the recognition of the duty of states to prevent cyber attacks. Many states criminalize such acts and prosecute cyber attacks to discourage attackers from committing law enforcement, which seems to be the only way to protect and prevent damage to their computer systems.\nThis gives credibility to the notion that, unlike a conventional attack, which can be stopped after detection, cyber attacks can only be stopped by setting ex ante barriers that attackers are trying to cross. Moreover, these practices demonstrate a growing acceptance among states that cyber attacks must be stopped and that the way to do this is to enforce the law[22].\nStates' responses to transnational terrorist attacks further support the recognition of a duty to prevent cyber attacks under customary international law. This involves the difficult task of analyzing data and clues about the existence and extent of such attacks[23].\nThe more cyber attacks resemble terrorism, the easier it will be to fit into the paradigm built to deal with transnational terrorism. However, regardless of their purpose, cyber attacks pose a threat to international peace and security and should be treated as a category of other recognized transnational threats.\nThe general principles of law common to civilized nations also support the recognition of the duty to prevent cyber attacks. It is a well-established principle in the domestic law of most states that individuals should be held liable for acts or omissions that have a causal link to the harm suffered by another person. While international law is not bound by the domestic laws of states, international law can be derived from the general principles common to the great legal systems of the world. Most states use causality as a principle for establishing individual responsibility, giving credibility to the idea that the responsibility of a state should also be based on causation[24].\nCyber attacks are extremely difficult for states to detect before committing a particular attack, and are often committed by individuals or groups who are not even on a state's radar. However, just because cyberattacks are difficult\n21Cyberspace, as a global electronic medium, cannot be dominated or controlled by a single nation.\n22Carr, Jeffrey, op. cit., p. 64.\n23For details on this issue and the analysis techniques that could be used, see Petersson, Gustav Jakob; Breul, Jonathan D. (2017), Cyber Society, Big Data, andxs Evaluation, Comparative Policy Evaluation, Volume 24 (colective papers), USA, pp. 47-75.\n24States's responsibility for negligence in taking all reasonable measures to prevent crime and to prosecute, prosecute and bring to justice transnational cybercriminals has also been recognized in international justice, such as the International Court of Justice. See, in this regard, Carr, Jeffrey, op.cit., p. 67.\nJournal of Law and Public Administration\nVolume VIII, Issue 15, 2022\nto prevent does not mean that states can breach their duty to prevent them, and by enforcing the law vigorously, they will deter cyberattacks. States that do not enact such laws do not fulfill their duty to prevent cyberattacks²⁵.\nA state's passivity and indifference to cyber attacks make it a sanctuary state, from which attackers can operate safely. When viewed in this light, it becomes clear that a state can be held indirectly responsible for cyber attacks in accordance with the established principles of customary international law.\nHost states will be judged on their efforts to catch and prosecute cyber-attackers, which is likely to be the main way in which states can deter and prevent future attacks. When victim states end up judging whether a host state has complied with its international obligations, the host states must cooperate with the former to ensure their transparency and good faith.\nOnce a host state proves that it is a sanctuary state by its inaction, the other states can blame it for cyber attacks originating in its territory. At that point, the host state becomes responsible for the cyber attack that triggered the initial investigation, as well as for all future cyber attacks that come from its borders. This opens the door for a victim state to use active defenses against the servers of the computers involved during a cyber attack.\nWhen attacks are carried out, most often by non-state actors, across state borders, attracting international responsibility (usually indirect), in this case, begins with an analysis of whether the armed attacks of non-state actors fall under the law of war continues with the duties that states have towards each other with regard to non-state actors on their territory²⁶, then moves on to ways of imputing state responsibility for the acts of non-state actors and ends with the legality of cross-border response operations against states²⁷.\nThus, a state's passivity or indifference to a non-state agent on its own territory could trigger its liability, possibly to the same extent, as if it had actively participated in the planning, an involvement that can be established by an analysis. post facto whether the state could have put more effort into preventing the cyber attack.\nBased on the above, it is clear that victim states can respond by force to armed attacks by non-state actors located in another state when host states violate their duty to prevent such attacks. If supplemented by cyber attacks, imputing state responsibility in this way gives states a legal way to use active defenses without the need to separately assign an attack to the state or its agents. In fact, imputation of liability is the equivalent of attributing the attack to the state or its agents.\nTherefore, in this case, it is essential to establish and explain why cyberattacks are armed attacks, which is the duty of a state to prevent cyberattacks, and the means and circumstances that would allow a victim state to respond by force to a cyber attack.\nMoreover, the attribution requirement perpetuates the \"response crisis\" because it is virtually impossible to attribute cyber attacks during the attack. Although states can track cyberattacks retroactively to the servers of computers in another state, conclusively establishing the identity of the attacker requires intensive investigation, which requires time and the help of the home state.\nGiven the ban on forcibly responding until an attack has been attributed to a state or its agents, coupled with the fact that the vast majority of cyber attacks are conducted by non-state actors, it should come as no surprise that states are reluctant to deal with cyber attacks as acts of war, thus risking violations of international law. This \"assignment issue\" blocks states in response²⁸.\n²⁵ Carr, Jeffrey, op.cit., p. 67.\n²⁶ It is a long-established principle of international law that a state is obliged to use diligence to prevent the commission of criminal acts against another nation or its people. Recognized in several international acts, the principle implies that a state cannot knowingly allow its territory to be used for actions contrary to the rights of other states. Of course, there is no absolute obligation on the host state to prevent all cyber attacks on its territory, but when a host state has the capacity to prevent an armed attack by non-state actors on its territory, it fails to do so. This violates its duty of prevention under international law.\n²⁷ For details on these stages, see Carr, Jeffrey, op.cit., p. 53 et seq.\n²⁸ For a graphic evolution, see Carr, Jeffrey, op.cit., p. 47.\nJournal of Law and Public Administration\nVolume VIII, Issue 15, 2022\nEarly detection and warning programs can help capture cyber attacks before they reach their climax, but even the best programs are not able to detect all cyber attacks.\nWhen an ongoing cyber attack has already caused a serious, immediate, invasive, direct, and measurable damage, it can be safely classified as an armed attack, even if it is still ongoing. On the other hand, when an attack did not cause such damage, the system administrator will have to consider: (1) a possible immediate future injury, (2) the likelihood of avoiding the attack with purely defensive measures, respectively (3) whether the attack should be classified as an imminent armed attack.\nAfter all, the state can avoid being the target of active defenses²⁹ from another state, even when the attacks come from its territory, by taking concrete measures to prevent cyber attacks, such as the implementation of cyber attacks. Of the legal framework on crime, the application of these laws and cooperation with victim states to bring the attackers to justice. In this endeavor, the human element, with all its strengths and weaknesses, is paramount.\nStates that violate their duty to prevent cyber attacks and refuse to change their practices should be held accountable - at least indirectly - for all subsequent attacks that come from within their borders, in accordance with the law of war. At a time when cyber attacks are threatening global security and states are struggling to find ways to improve their cyber defenses, there is no reason to protect sanctuary states from the legal use of active defenses by victim states, and there is every reason to increase the state's defense against cyber attacks.\nIn other words, states not only enjoy rights, but must also fulfill certain obligations under international law, among which the idea of \"due diligence\" occupies a central place - a state is obliged to use diligence to prevent the commission within the limits its criminal acts against other nations³⁰. This duty of states is continuous, compared to the need to protect other states against harmful acts of individuals - state or non-state actors, individuals or legal entities - launched from within their own jurisdictions (called \"sanctuary states\").\nIn this new age of cyber warfare, the Web is both a battlefield and an information space. Social services such as Twitter, Facebook, MySpace or LiveJournal are an essential part of the hacker's toolkit. Commonly known as the Social Web, these services provide an unprecedented repository of personal data, personal information about people, companies and governments, which can be used for financial crime, espionage and misinformation, both by state hackers and by non-state actors.\n## IV. Cyber espionage – an adjacent weapon in cyber warfare?\nCyber warfare - sometimes called \"bloodless war\" - is closely linked to cybercrime, cyber security, cyber terrorism, cyber espionage, cyberspace, the differentiation between these concepts being sensitive because they are largely intertwined. The armies of the world are struggling to cope with a new field of cyber battle, by delimiting and framing their actions in the sphere of practical applicability of these concepts.\nIt is often impossible to determine whether attempts to hack a computer in another state were acts of cyber warfare or cyber intelligence gathering. Unlike cyber attack activity, the collection of information is not always based on cyber exploitation as a facilitator³¹.\n²⁹ Active defense is the most appropriate type of force to use against cyber attacks in light of jus in bello principles. First of all, in terms of military necessity, active defense is probably the full force needed to carry out the mission of defending against a cyber attack. Active defense can track down an attack at the source and immediately annihilate it, while kinetic weapons will be slower and less effective than the speed of a hack-back. Therefore, the use of kinetic weapons to the detriment of active defense will not only be less effective, but will also violate the principle of necessity by employing force only for the sake of destruction. In addition, the choice between active defense versus kinetic weapons should reduce the possibility of escalating these situations on a large scale in armed conflicts between states.\n³⁰ Maurer, Tim (2018). Cyber mercenaries, The State, Hackers and Power, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, p. 130. The author refers to the jurisprudence of the International Court of Justice which stated that \"it is the obligation of each state not to knowingly allow the territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other states.\"\n³¹ For methods of collecting information in the virtual environment, see Oakley, Jacob G, op.cit., pp. 96 - 97. And for the relationship between cyber intelligence gathering, cyber reconnaissance and cyber attacks, broadly, op.cit., pp. 102-108.\nJournal of Law and Public Administration\nVolume VIII, Issue 15, 2022\nIn international law, cyberespionage has been defined as \"the practice of spying or using spies to obtain information about the plans and activities of a foreign government or a competing company\"³².\nAnother interesting thing about espionage is that it is not always sponsored or initiated by the enemy state. In fact, in many cases of espionage around the world, the person who collects information and transmits it to foreign powers has done so of his own free will, sometimes out of revenge and sometimes for reasons of financial compensation, or for other philosophical and ethical reasons.\nCyberespionage may seem similar, but it is different from a motivational point of view, with cyber manipulation activities. Manipulation, as a form of cyber attack, consists of controlling or modifying information, information systems and / or networks in cyberspace to create physical effects of denial, using deception, bait, conditioning, forgery, and other similar techniques. Use your opponent's information resources for the purpose of apparent friendship, to create clues that do not appear immediately in cyberspace. The targeted network may appear to be operating normally until side or tertiary effects occur, including proven physical effects of the attack³³.\n## V. Conclusions\nNo change in technology so far, however, seems to rival the potential for transformation as much as the development of offensive cyber capabilities. Indeed, this is demonstrated by the invention of a new label for the notion of war involving cyber attacks, namely \"cyber warfare\", as if it were not just a new type of weapon, but a whole new kind of war.\nIn the circumstances of the armed / classical war, the growing importance of both military and personal data or otherwise protected by law is obvious. In an age when individuals voluntarily understand how to transmit, store, and receive large amounts of personal data over the Internet, planting software in electronic devices to erase, modify, or approximate data is becoming a crucial new tactic of war: a \"fifth dimension battlefield\", as it is often said in doctrine, after air, sea, earth and outer space³⁴.\nThis change in staff has led to the merger of military and corporate espionage functions, and as a result, the militarization of cyberspace has created legal and moral ambiguity regarding privacy rights, as well as a personal responsibility to be targeted in cyberspace. virtue of the simple position it occupies in relation to an information network.\nThese tendencies contributed to the change in the structure of the war, with the result that the line distinction between the military and the civilian field blurred. Cyber warfare operations thus occupy a crucial position in the changing landscape of military conflict and require prompt response from the victim states, provided that the proportionality and correct identification of attackers and the international legal framework are respected.\nProportionality must be encouraged, for example, because it is a crucial issue in military ethics as well as in common criminal law. It requires that no more force be used than is necessary to repel an attack or to fulfill other legitimate objectives. But how do you determine what constitutes a necessary response to a cyber attack?

Specific and the Commitment of State Responsibility\nVasile COMAN\nTitu Maiorescu University, Romania\nFaculty of Law, Bucharest\nLaw Doctoral School\nPrahova Court, Romania\nCriminal section, Ploiești\nv.comann@yahoo.com\n# Abstract:\nDue to their worrying presence, cyber attacks pose new challenges to states, both nationally and between states, and are almost non-existent during recent military conflicts. Global peace requires at the legal and practical level a firm reaction against their use, but with the observance of rules and limits of the intensity of the force used, including the real need and proportionality.\nThe study seeks to establish some guidelines under the mentioned aspects, far from being widely accepted in current legal and political doctrines, and can be a starting point in developing a predictable legislative framework effective, effective in action and decisive in preserving the real sense of security individual and collective.\nKeywords: cyber attacks; war; armed conflict; responsibility; state.\n# I. Introduction\nThe presence of cybernetics in the modern life of states is a reality that can no longer be ignored, bringing undeniable benefits to people's well-being, but being accompanied by certain risks, the most important of which is the use of technological advantages for criminal or illicit purposes in general. The risk is real and it can already be seen empirically that in the case of recent armed conflicts (for example, the Russia-Ukraine conflict that began on February 24, 2022), the cyber component is not only used consistently, but is and targeted by attacks of the same nature by combatants.\nIt is important to note that, while the term \"cyber attack\" is often used in the literature, to date, all but a few effects of offensive cyber operations have remained below the level considered to be the use of force or armed attack, within the meaning of the provisions of the United Nations Charter. Moreover, malicious cyber activity can take place over an extended period of time - months, if not years - and is often not detected. For this reason, such activity is therefore better described as \"cyber operations\" than as \"attack.\"1.\nIn the military and international law, there are heated discussions about possible situations in which cyber attacks can be qualified as acts of war in themselves, especially when they take place during actual armed attacks. However, it is true that the increasing emergence of cyber attacks and the introduction of new technologies in the military and electronics industry have led to a fundamental change in the features that previously characterized acts of pure kinetic warfare, so it may seem necessary to adapt the law of war and international humanitarian law. which must evolve just as fast2.\nJournal of Law and Public Administration\nVolume VIII, Issue 15, 2022\n## II. Cyber Attacks. Specific and content\nIn order to keep the internet safe and peaceful, it is vital to establish the constitutive content of cyber attacks, the manner of manifestation and the targets primarily targeted, so that they can be recognized when they occur or, ideally, in time.\nIdentifying the real actors behind a cyber attack is a notoriously difficult task, which increases exponentially in the event of an armed conflict. Attributing attacks to individual actors (states or international organizations, or private actors) is traditionally seen as an acid test to determine whether an attack is assessed as an act of cyber warfare that complements kinetic warfare, or just an act. conjunctural of cyber terrorism (\"cyber hooliganism\").\nCyber attribution is the act of tying together cyber activities in such an aggression, based on their attributes, to determine if they come from the same actor, the most difficult part being determining the motivation of the latter. The logical attribution process consists of 4 steps: a) Discovering the indicators of compromise of the attacked systems - by administering evidence of unauthorized activity in a network or organization, b) Associating them together as belonging to specific actors based on their attributes, c) Precise identification of the actor, d) determination of the actor's motivation.\nThe assignment process can target a particular unit, organization, or even individual behind the cyber activity. The award process is particularly important in this situation, in which, without identity and motivation, it is not possible to know who the enemy is and, implicitly, how to be annihilated with an active or passive response, tactical or technical, from the victim state.\nUnlike weapons of mass destruction, cyber attacks are \"weapons of mass iritation\" and can cause a \"computer pandemic,\" and in the event of an armed conflict, they are non-physical in nature.\nCyber attacks are generally non-public and usually target government or private institutions, usually major financial institutions affecting public confidence in Internet-mediated transactions, severely disrupting their critical infrastructure and security architecture.\nAmong the most publicized in recent years are cyber attacks in the 2008 Russia-Georgia conflict, cyber attacks on Estonia in 2007 (the most important recent cyber war, which was led by a group of young pro-Kremlin), the military operation of Russia in Chechnya, which have shown that computer systems are an important component of future wars, so concrete legislative measures are needed to limit and eliminate attacks in this area.\nDuring an armed conflict, the cybernetic component unequivocally plays a key role, disrupting the electronic communication systems of combat units; it is a quasi-official part of the military war strategies developed by states.\nJens David; Govern, Kevin; Finkelstein, Claire (2015), Cyberwar. Law and Ethics for Virtual Conflicts, Oxford: Oxford University Press, United Kingdom, pp. 16-17.\n Oakley, Jacob G. (2019), Waging cyberwar. technical challenges and operational constraints, New York: Apress Publishing, USA, pp. 114.\n For details on the steps to be taken in cyber attack, see Oakley, Jacob G., op.cit., pp. 116-130.\n Moreover, the award decision must weigh operationally other concerns, political ramifications, strategic impacts and even moral dilemmas.\n Carr, Jeffrey (2012), Inside Cyber Warfare. Mapping the cyberunderworld, Sebastopol, California: O'Reilly Media Inc., p. 8.\n Covert cyber actions can be of two general types: (1) propaganda and misinformation that would be the subject of psychological operations to manipulate the evolution of the real armed conflict; and, (2) actions to shut down the computer networks of the target countries\n On the cyber side of the war in Georgia, coordinated by www.stopGeorgia.info (located in Germany) and www.stopGeorgia.ru (located in the USA), see, José Rios, Maria; Tenreiro de Magalhães, Sérgio; Santos, Leonel, The Georgia's cyberwar, available at www.researchgate.net. The attacks consisted mainly of SQL Injection and DDoS actions.\n The immediate cause of the cyber attacks on Estonia was the Estonian government's decision to move a war memorial of the Soviet Army from central Tallinn, the capital of Estonia. Many Estonians see the memorial as a harsh reminder of the former Soviet Union's \"occupation\" of Estonia, while many Russians see the statue as a memorial to the Red Army's sacrifices in liberating Estonia from Nazi Germany.\nJournal of Law and Public Administration\nVolume VIII, Issue 15, 2022\nThere are multi-national private hackers (nonstate hackers or patriotic hackers) secretly hired by states to move the real origin and responsibility for plausible deniability, while they enjoy the results of the attackers and support them. these by providing the necessary resources.\nThus, in times of armed conflict or political tension between states, some members of a state's citizens may be motivated to support the country's war or political effort by taking direct action on the cyber component of the enemy involved in the conflict. Hackers (\"patriotic hackers\") are private citizens qualified in cyber attack capabilities, who can initiate a cyber attack against another state on their own. They may do so without the consent, direction or control of the State to which they belong or in whose territory they are located. However, there have been incidents in which it is suspected that hacktivists were encouraged and aided by the state, being used as proxies (eg the 2007 cyber attack on Estonia, attributed by the West to Russia).\nRegardless of the origin of the perpetrator, cyber attacks in the context of an armed conflict can have the following objectives:\na) Exposing current realities (eg in 2008 in the context of the Israeli-led war against Palestine, Israeli hackers penetrated Palestinian TV and radio stations, inserting scenes with the death of Palestinian leaders).\nb) Implement malicious attack programs on unmanned military drones (eg Conficker C virus) frequently used in armed conflict, compared to the reality that military units understand the strategic and tactical need for unmanned aerial systems (UAS), making them an integral part of their arsenal of monitoring or even attacking the enemy.\nb) The paralysis of the targeted websites for certain periods of time and the blocking of the normal activity of some critical institutions of the state, with indirect consequences on the public services, including of some smaller businesses / firms; attackers can change the language used by the attacked sites or the IP address (eg in the 2008 Gaza war - the \"cast lead\" operation), or post messages against the war or with the dead violence.\nc) indirectly causing material damage to the institutions or legal or even natural persons concerned - even by restricting regular access to the Internet, by attacks on governmental (political) or commercial sites, or by silencing political opponents.\nFor example, in the 2009 elections in Iran, when the government decided to shut down the internet in the country in order to stop the massive protests of election fraud, carried out through Facebook and Twitter, in a context in which hackers from opposition parties would have launched DDoS attacks on government sites.\nd) collecting relevant data sought by penetrating networks, including by creating fictitious pages (phishing) or fictitious groups on social networks - communication (eg, Facebook, Telegram) to influence the mood of the population concerned.\nThe purpose is to shape and control public opinion about how events actually unfolded by DDoS, SQL Injection, or Crosssite scripting (XSS) attacks on government sites (Government, Banks, Parliament, Ministries, Lines). communication, embassy websites)\n We emphasize that international law presupposes that armed conflict is initiated only by states (as subjects of law) and not by groups or individuals.\n Demonstrating a link between non-state actors, hacktivists and the beneficiary government can be difficult, sometimes impossible or takes too long to confirm that the competent legal authority of the target state can take swift response.\n As we will see in the section on the attribution and imputability of cyber attacks, according to international law, if patriotic hackers carry out a cyber attack against another state that rises to the level of an \"armed attack\", the victim state has the legal right, acting inself-defense, to use force against those hackers.\n From missiles armed with missiles or bombs to so-called traditional ammunition drones (also known as kamikaze drones), this unmanned technology completes many new challenges and opens up a whole new set of possibilities for armed forces around the world.\n Politically motivated cyber attacks range in sophistication, from small-scale denial of simple attacks to well-organized and covert espionage attacks. The sophistication of a cyber attack depends on the skill of the attackers and the amount of reconnaissance performed before the attack. For considerations regarding cyber warfare capabilities in Australia, Brazil, Canada, North Korea, Estonia, Czech Republic, France, Germany, India, Iran, Israel, Italy, Kenya, NATO, China, Pakistan, etc. - see Carr, Jeffrey, op.cit., pp. 243 - 262. An example of a political attack is during the 2009 Nigerian elections to control election information.\nJournal of Law and Public Administration\nVolume VIII, Issue 15, 2022\ne) for recognizing and imposing a supremacy between cyber hackers, taking advantage of the context of kinetic conflict. For example, during the 2006-2008 Gaza war (eg Team Evil, Cold Zero, - formats for resistance to the Gaza war).\nThis notoriety can also occur through the acquisition of cyber attacks during major social crises or key moments in society (eg presidential elections, change of political regime). Among those known, Team Hell - a group of hackers with political or religious orientations, Agd_Scorp, Jurm Team, C-H Team, Gaza Hacker Team, DNS Team, DZ Team, etc. were mentioned in the literature.\nf) to transmit signals of the cyber capacity of a state, to other states in conflict or competition (eg in 2009, on the day of the USA were attacked several strategic sites, of some government institutions and of some private companies - which carries out contracts with the state on military projects, in this sense being suspected North Korea).\ng) the insertion of sophisticated viruses in the target computers, for the exploitation of resources or the search for classified information, and if the compromised computer system is part of a larger network, the attacker obtains access to the main network; it takes advantage of the fact that antivirus technology simply cannot keep pace with known threats, much less those they are unaware of.\nIn the case of armed (kinetic) conflicts, the targets of interest (cyber bullets) include hubs and other crucial links in the system that move enemy troops involved in the war, such as ports, airports, means of transport, battlefield facilities and communications. Targets could include computer systems located in the enemy state or abroad, command and control nodes, spatial information, surveillance, and means of recognition and communication, command, control and information systems.\nOne such example is cyber attacks on tanks used in a pending military operation, in which a state may have a cyber weapon capable of harming its enemy's tanks. Tanks are equipped with computerized weapon systems in today's armies and could be susceptible to cyber attacks. A single cyber weapon may be able to stop the controls of the electric motor or the tank, virtually eliminating it from combat. Another cyber weapon can attack the warhead reinforcement system or the targeting system for the same purpose. Both effects are considered cyber attacks.\nPredictably, cyber attacks will target telecommunications infrastructure (e.g., a virus designed to shut off power to military installations), transportation infrastructure, secure networks, the economy, energy (generating blackouts), security breaches, and disabling security breaches. programs to protect the targeted systems, sometimes leaving graffiti behind in the attacked sites (containing information about certain exposed individuals) or on the main page, the online banking payment systems.\nAs a way of action, hack tek strategies are developed by organized crime in cyber underground labs and usually start by attacking individual servers or computers by infecting with Trojan viruses, such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) and SQL Injection.\nThe more advanced the technology, the more attacks appeared in forms not previously covered by official statements and state practices.\nCyber attacks come in many different forms, their destructive potential being limited only by the creativity and skill of the attackers behind them, and usually a kinetic attack is combined with a support cyber attack. Although it may seem intuitive that cyberattacks may constitute armed attacks, especially in light of their indirect ability to injure or kill, the legal\n For details on the profile of these groups of hackers and their guidelines, see Carr, Jeffrey, op.cit., pp. 22-27.\n Often, the selection of the target is given two main considerations: the value of the information that will be obtained and the difficulty of success in operation (to exclude the probability of detection).\n The same goes for intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). ICBM launchers are developed within the limits of state secrecy and can essentially hit anywhere in the world in the execution of an attack. Although countermeasures capable of intercepting ICBMs have been developed, some states, such as Russia and North Korea, have recently announced that they have developed models that cannot be intercepted at this time (eg Sarmat / Satan 2, in the case of Russia).\n DDoS attacks typically disrupt communications and computing capabilities by sending huge amounts of (sometimes malformed) traffic to devices to alter or deny their ability to function as originally intended. They are common on the Internet because they are relatively unsophisticated and can be targeted from an Internet presence point in the cyberspace of one state against one in another enemy state.\nJournal of Law and Public Administration\nVolume VIII, Issue 15, 2022\ncommunity has been reluctant to take this approach, as cyberattacks do not resemble traditional armed attacks with conventional weapons, having another specific manifestation.\nThe exploitation of computer systems in cyber warfare is, in fact, an exploitation of the human errors of those who thought and built them into their elements - ways of exploiting, reconfiguring or overwriting computer programs (eg, a virtual gateway which uses facial recognition is altered, nullifying the image component, or a cyber attack that corrupts the hard disks of the surveillance cameras where their recordings are stored, or the steering systems of some devices engaged in kinetic warfare).\n## III. Establishing the responsibility of the state for cyber attacks carried out on its territory\nStates may not respond to a cross-border cyber attack by force without first establishing the State's responsibility for the attack. Although historically this has meant that an attack has taken place, to be attributed to a state or its agents, direct control of an attack is no longer a requirement of state responsibility. Today, international law is based on the responsibility of a state and only on the breach of its international obligations to prevent and combat it.\nThis change is particularly important for cyber attacks, as the prevailing view is that cross-border cyber attacks should be treated as a criminal matter rather than a national security issue, and this seems to be based on the historical view of state responsibility. This limited view of state responsibility blocks attacked states in the response crisis by requiring states to attribute cyber attacks to a state or its agents before responding through active defenses, even if the likelihood of successfully assigning a ranged attack is generally uncertain. Consequently, states in crisis in response to a cyber attack act under the false assumption that they must decide between effective but illegal active defenses and the less effective but legal path of passive defenses and the scope of domestic criminal law.\nGiven the perspective of state responsibility, states should first determine whether the cyber attack can be blamed on the home state. Once a cyber attack is blamed on a state and that state refuses to comply with its international obligations, the legal barriers to self-defense action disappear.\nWith regard to cyber attacks, the accepted principles of common *jus ad bellum* still support the imputation of state responsibility for armed attacks by non-state actors when the attacks come from a state that allows non-state actors to carry out criminal operations within their borders. States that allow non-state actors to carry out these operations are in breach of their duty to prevent attacks on other states and are known as \"sanctuary states\". This is extremely important for cyber-attack states because when a cyber-attack comes from a sanctuary state, a victim-state can use active defenses and avoid crisis response.\nTherefore, we need to understand the answers to two key questions:\n- What does a state's duty to prevent cyber attacks mean?\nThis obligation in fact includes several smaller tasks to prevent cyber attacks, including the adoption of strict criminal laws, the vigorous enforcement of investigative procedures, the prosecution of attackers and, during the investigation and prosecution, cooperation with cyber-attack states. These are the duties of all states and are binding as customary international law. The authority for these duties comes from all three sources of international tradition in the field of law - international conventions, international customs and general principles of law common to civilized nations, as evidenced by the judgments and teachings of the most qualified international lawyers.\nThe only international treaty analogous to cybernetics is the European Convention on Cybercrime in 2001. Although the treaty is only a regional agreement, it is still very influential on customary international law because of the importance of the states that have ratified it, originating from the doctrine of the states particularly affected.\n---\nUnlike conventional warfare, an autonomous and exclusive act of warfare in the cyber realm is difficult to conceive.\nAvailable at www.eur-lex.europa.eu.The Cybercrime Convention requires its parties to establish \"criminal\" offences for almost every conceivable type of cyber attack, in accordance with their domestic law.\nJournal of Law and Public Administration\nVolume VIII, Issue 15, 2022\nIn addition, it demonstrates the recognition by states of both the need to criminalize cyber attacks and the obligation of states to prevent their territory from being used by non-state actors to conduct cyber attacks against other states. The convention is also significant because it recognizes that cyber attacks cannot be banned during an attack, and the only way to prevent them is through aggressive law enforcement, coupled with state cooperation.\nInternational Terrorist Terrorism Treaties provide additional, albeit indirect, support for the duty to prevent cyber attacks. The international community recognizes terrorism as a threat to international peace and security, but no agreement has been reached on a definition. As a result, states have increasingly taken the approach of outlawing certain acts of terrorism - terrorists are constantly developing new methods of attack, rather than outlawing terrorism itself.\nThese treaties impose on states several common requirements regarding terrorist attacks, such as taking all practicable measures to prevent such attacks, criminalizing attacks, referring cases to the competent authorities for prosecution, and obliging states to cooperate with each other during criminal proceedings[21]. Although these treaties do not address cyber attacks, the principles contained therein contribute to influencing state requirements under customary international law on terrorism. As there is growing evidence that cyberattacks will soon be an active weapon for terrorists, states should refer to the common principles found in these treaties as opinio juris when cyberattacks are used as a terrorist weapon.\n- What must a state do to avoid violating its duty to prevent?\nThe treatment of cyber attacks in accordance with their criminal law also proves the recognition of the duty of states to prevent cyber attacks. Many states criminalize such acts and prosecute cyber attacks to discourage attackers from committing law enforcement, which seems to be the only way to protect and prevent damage to their computer systems.\nThis gives credibility to the notion that, unlike a conventional attack, which can be stopped after detection, cyber attacks can only be stopped by setting ex ante barriers that attackers are trying to cross. Moreover, these practices demonstrate a growing acceptance among states that cyber attacks must be stopped and that the way to do this is to enforce the law[22].\nStates' responses to transnational terrorist attacks further support the recognition of a duty to prevent cyber attacks under customary international law. This involves the difficult task of analyzing data and clues about the existence and extent of such attacks[23].\nThe more cyber attacks resemble terrorism, the easier it will be to fit into the paradigm built to deal with transnational terrorism. However, regardless of their purpose, cyber attacks pose a threat to international peace and security and should be treated as a category of other recognized transnational threats.\nThe general principles of law common to civilized nations also support the recognition of the duty to prevent cyber attacks. It is a well-established principle in the domestic law of most states that individuals should be held liable for acts or omissions that have a causal link to the harm suffered by another person. While international law is not bound by the domestic laws of states, international law can be derived from the general principles common to the great legal systems of the world. Most states use causality as a principle for establishing individual responsibility, giving credibility to the idea that the responsibility of a state should also be based on causation[24].\nCyber attacks are extremely difficult for states to detect before committing a particular attack, and are often committed by individuals or groups who are not even on a state's radar. However, just because cyberattacks are difficult\n21Cyberspace, as a global electronic medium, cannot be dominated or controlled by a single nation.\n22Carr, Jeffrey, op. cit., p. 64.\n23For details on this issue and the analysis techniques that could be used, see Petersson, Gustav Jakob; Breul, Jonathan D. (2017), Cyber Society, Big Data, andxs Evaluation, Comparative Policy Evaluation, Volume 24 (colective papers), USA, pp. 47-75.\n24States's responsibility for negligence in taking all reasonable measures to prevent crime and to prosecute, prosecute and bring to justice transnational cybercriminals has also been recognized in international justice, such as the International Court of Justice. See, in this regard, Carr, Jeffrey, op.cit., p. 67.\nJournal of Law and Public Administration\nVolume VIII, Issue 15, 2022\nto prevent does not mean that states can breach their duty to prevent them, and by enforcing the law vigorously, they will deter cyberattacks. States that do not enact such laws do not fulfill their duty to prevent cyberattacks.\nA state's passivity and indifference to cyber attacks make it a sanctuary state, from which attackers can operate safely. When viewed in this light, it becomes clear that a state can be held indirectly responsible for cyber attacks in accordance with the established principles of customary international law.\nHost states will be judged on their efforts to catch and prosecute cyber-attackers, which is likely to be the main way in which states can deter and prevent future attacks. When victim states end up judging whether a host state has complied with its international obligations, the host states must cooperate with the former to ensure their transparency and good faith.\nOnce a host state proves that it is a sanctuary state by its inaction, the other states can blame it for cyber attacks originating in its territory. At that point, the host state becomes responsible for the cyber attack that triggered the initial investigation, as well as for all future cyber attacks that come from its borders. This opens the door for a victim state to use active defenses against the servers of the computers involved during a cyber attack.\nWhen attacks are carried out, most often by non-state actors, across state borders, attracting international responsibility (usually indirect), in this case, begins with an analysis of whether the armed attacks of non-state actors fall under the law of war continues with the duties that states have towards each other with regard to non-state actors on their territory, then moves on to ways of imputing state responsibility for the acts of non-state actors and ends with the legality of cross-border response operations against states.\nThus, a state's passivity or indifference to a non-state agent on its own territory could trigger its liability, possibly to the same extent, as if it had actively participated in the planning, an involvement that can be established by an analysis. post facto whether the state could have put more effort into preventing the cyber attack.\nBased on the above, it is clear that victim states can respond by force to armed attacks by non-state actors located in another state when host states violate their duty to prevent such attacks. If supplemented by cyber attacks, imputing state responsibility in this way gives states a legal way to use active defenses without the need to separately assign an attack to the state or its agents. In fact, imputation of liability is the equivalent of attributing the attack to the state or its agents.\nTherefore, in this case, it is essential to establish and explain why cyberattacks are armed attacks, which is the duty of a state to prevent cyberattacks, and the means and circumstances that would allow a victim state to respond by force to a cyber attack.\nMoreover, the attribution requirement perpetuates the \"response crisis\" because it is virtually impossible to attribute cyber attacks during the attack. Although states can track cyberattacks retroactively to the servers of computers in another state, conclusively establishing the identity of the attacker requires intensive investigation, which requires time and the help of the home state.\nGiven the ban on forcibly responding until an attack has been attributed to a state or its agents, coupled with the fact that the vast majority of cyber attacks are conducted by non-state actors, it should come as no surprise that states are reluctant to deal with cyber attacks as acts of war, thus risking violations of international law. This \"assignment issue\" blocks states in response.\n Carr, Jeffrey, op.cit., p. 67.\n It is a long-established principle of international law that a state is obliged to use diligence to prevent the commission of criminal acts against another nation or its people. Recognized in several international acts, the principle implies that a state cannot knowingly allow its territory to be used for actions contrary to the rights of other states. Of course, there is no absolute obligation on the host state to prevent all cyber attacks on its territory, but when a host state has the capacity to prevent an armed attack by non-state actors on its territory, it fails to do so. This violates its duty of prevention under international law.\n For details on these stages, see Carr, Jeffrey, op.cit., p. 53 et seq.\n For a graphic evolution, see Carr, Jeffrey, op.cit., p. 47.\nJournal of Law and Public Administration\nVolume VIII, Issue 15, 2022\nEarly detection and warning programs can help capture cyber attacks before they reach their climax, but even the best programs are not able to detect all cyber attacks.\nWhen an ongoing cyber attack has already caused a serious, immediate, invasive, direct, and measurable damage, it can be safely classified as an armed attack, even if it is still ongoing. On the other hand, when an attack did not cause such damage, the system administrator will have to consider: (1) a possible immediate future injury, (2) the likelihood of avoiding the attack with purely defensive measures, respectively (3) whether the attack should be classified as an imminent armed attack.\nAfter all, the state can avoid being the target of active defenses from another state, even when the attacks come from its territory, by taking concrete measures to prevent cyber attacks, such as the implementation of cyber attacks. Of the legal framework on crime, the application of these laws and cooperation with victim states to bring the attackers to justice. In this endeavor, the human element, with all its strengths and weaknesses, is paramount.\nStates that violate their duty to prevent cyber attacks and refuse to change their practices should be held accountable - at least indirectly - for all subsequent attacks that come from within their borders, in accordance with the law of war. At a time when cyber attacks are threatening global security and states are struggling to find ways to improve their cyber defenses, there is no reason to protect sanctuary states from the legal use of active defenses by victim states, and there is every reason to increase the state's defense against cyber attacks.\nIn other words, states not only enjoy rights, but must also fulfill certain obligations under international law, among which the idea of \"due diligence\" occupies a central place - a state is obliged to use diligence to prevent the commission within the limits its criminal acts against other nations. This duty of states is continuous, compared to the need to protect other states against harmful acts of individuals - state or non-state actors, individuals or legal entities - launched from within their own jurisdictions (called \"sanctuary states\").\nIn this new age of cyber warfare, the Web is both a battlefield and an information space. Social services such as Twitter, Facebook, MySpace or LiveJournal are an essential part of the hacker's toolkit. Commonly known as the Social Web, these services provide an unprecedented repository of personal data, personal information about people, companies and governments, which can be used for financial crime, espionage and misinformation, both by state hackers and by non-state actors.\n## IV. Cyber espionage – an adjacent weapon in cyber warfare?\nCyber warfare - sometimes called \"bloodless war\" - is closely linked to cybercrime, cyber security, cyber terrorism, cyber espionage, cyberspace, the differentiation between these concepts being sensitive because they are largely intertwined. The armies of the world are struggling to cope with a new field of cyber battle, by delimiting and framing their actions in the sphere of practical applicability of these concepts.\nIt is often impossible to determine whether attempts to hack a computer in another state were acts of cyber warfare or cyber intelligence gathering. Unlike cyber attack activity, the collection of information is not always based on cyber exploitation as a facilitator.\n Active defense is the most appropriate type of force to use against cyber attacks in light of jus in bello principles. First of all, in terms of military necessity, active defense is probably the full force needed to carry out the mission of defending against a cyber attack. Active defense can track down an attack at the source and immediately annihilate it, while kinetic weapons will be slower and less effective than the speed of a hack-back. Therefore, the use of kinetic weapons to the detriment of active defense will not only be less effective, but will also violate the principle of necessity by employing force only for the sake of destruction. In addition, the choice between active defense versus kinetic weapons should reduce the possibility of escalating these situations on a large scale in armed conflicts between states.\n Maurer, Tim (2018). Cyber mercenaries, The State, Hackers and Power, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, p. 130. The author refers to the jurisprudence of the International Court of Justice which stated that \"it is the obligation of each state not to knowingly allow the territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other states.\"\n For methods of collecting information in the virtual environment, see Oakley, Jacob G, op.cit., pp. 96 - 97. And for the relationship between cyber intelligence gathering, cyber reconnaissance and cyber attacks, broadly, op.cit., pp. 102-108.\nJournal of Law and Public Administration\nVolume VIII, Issue 15, 2022\nIn international law, cyberespionage has been defined as \"the practice of spying or using spies to obtain information about the plans and activities of a foreign government or a competing company\".\nAnother interesting thing about espionage is that it is not always sponsored or initiated by the enemy state. In fact, in many cases of espionage around the world, the person who collects information and transmits it to foreign powers has done so of his own free will, sometimes out of revenge and sometimes for reasons of financial compensation, or for other philosophical and ethical reasons.\nCyberespionage may seem similar, but it is different from a motivational point of view, with cyber manipulation activities. Manipulation, as a form of cyber attack, consists of controlling or modifying information, information systems and / or networks in cyberspace to create physical effects of denial, using deception, bait, conditioning, forgery, and other similar techniques. Use your opponent's information resources for the purpose of apparent friendship, to create clues that do not appear immediately in cyberspace. The targeted network may appear to be operating normally until side or tertiary effects occur, including proven physical effects of the attack.\n## V. Conclusions\nNo change in technology so far, however, seems to rival the potential for transformation as much as the development of offensive cyber capabilities. Indeed, this is demonstrated by the invention of a new label for the notion of war involving cyber attacks, namely \"cyber warfare\", as if it were not just a new type of weapon, but a whole new kind of war.\nIn the circumstances of the armed / classical war, the growing importance of both military and personal data or otherwise protected by law is obvious. In an age when individuals voluntarily understand how to transmit, store, and receive large amounts of personal data over the Internet, planting software in electronic devices to erase, modify, or approximate data is becoming a crucial new tactic of war: a \"fifth dimension battlefield\", as it is often said in doctrine, after air, sea, earth and outer space.\nThis change in staff has led to the merger of military and corporate espionage functions, and as a result, the militarization of cyberspace has created legal and moral ambiguity regarding privacy rights, as well as a personal responsibility to be targeted in cyberspace. virtue of the simple position it occupies in relation to an information network.\nThese tendencies contributed to the change in the structure of the war, with the result that the line distinction between the military and the civilian field blurred. Cyber warfare operations thus occupy a crucial position in the changing landscape of military conflict and require prompt response from the victim states, provided that the proportionality and correct identification of attackers and the international legal framework are respected.\nProportionality must be encouraged, for example, because it is a crucial issue in military ethics as well as in common criminal law. It requires that no more force be used than is necessary to repel an attack or to fulfill other legitimate objectives. But how do you determine what constitutes a necessary response to a cyber attack? More importantly, how should we determine if it is ever proportionate to launch an offensive cyber warfare counterattack? There are open-ended questions raised in the relevant literature, to which the practice is to be answered, being undoubtedly that the legitimate collective defense requires a more precise and responsible action against the dangers arising with the evolution of technology and its malicious use for which run counter to individual or collective safety.",

    "# I. Introduction The presence of cybernetics in the modern life of states is a reality that can no longer be ignored, bringing undeniable benefits to people's well-being, but being accompanied by certain risks, the most important of which is the use of technological advantages for criminal or illicit purposes in general. The risk is real and it can already be seen empirically that in the case of recent armed conflicts (for example, the Russia-Ukraine conflict that began on February 24, 2022), the cyber component is not only used consistently, but is and targeted by attacks of the same nature by combatants.": "It is important to note that, while the term\"cyber attack\"is often used in the literature, to date, all but a few effects of offensive cyber operations have remained below the level considered to be the use of force or armed attack, within the meaning of the provisions of the United Nations Charter. Moreover, malicious cyber activity can take place over an extended period of time - months, if not years - and is often not detected. For this reason, such activity is therefore better described as\"cyber operations\"than as\"attack.\"1.\nIn the military and international law, there are heated discussions about possible situations in which cyber attacks can be qualified as acts of war in themselves, especially when they take place during actual armed attacks. However, it is true that the increasing emergence of cyber attacks and the introduction of new technologies in the military and electronics industry have led to a fundamental change in the features that previously characterized acts of pure kinetic warfare, so it may seem necessary to adapt the law of war and international humanitarian law. which must evolve just as fast2.\nJournal of Law and Public Administration Volume VIII, Issue 15, 2022 ## II. Cyber Attacks. Specific and content In order to keep the internet safe and peaceful, it is vital to establish the constitutive content of cyber attacks, the manner of manifestation and the targets primarily targeted, so that they can be recognized when they occur or, ideally, in time.\nIdentifying the real actors behind a cyber attack is a notoriously difficult task, which increases exponentially in the event of an armed conflict. Attributing attacks to individual actors (states or international organizations, or private actors) is traditionally seen as an acid test to determine whether an attack is assessed as an act of cyber warfare that complements kinetic warfare, or just an act. conjunctural of cyber terrorism (\"cyber hooliganism\").\nCyber attribution is the act of tying together cyber activities in such an aggression, based on their attributes, to determine if they come from the same actor, the most difficult part being determining the motivation of the latter³. The logical attribution process consists of 4 steps: a) Discovering the indicators of compromise of the attacked systems - by administering evidence of unauthorized activity in a network or organization, b) Associating them together as belonging to specific actors based on their attributes, c) Precise identification of the actor, d) determination of the actor's motivation⁴.\nThe assignment process can target a particular unit, organization, or even individual behind the cyber activity. The award process is particularly important in this situation, in which, without identity and motivation, it is not possible to know who the enemy is and, implicitly, how to be annihilated with an active or passive response, tactical or technical, from the victim state⁵.\nUnlike weapons of mass destruction, cyber attacks are\"weapons of mass iritation\"⁶ and can cause a\"computer pandemic,\"and in the event of an armed conflict, they are non-physical in nature.\nCyber attacks are generally non-public and usually target government or private institutions, usually major financial institutions affecting public confidence in Internet-mediated transactions, severely disrupting their critical infrastructure and security architecture⁷.\nAmong the most publicized in recent years are cyber attacks in the 2008 Russia-Georgia conflict⁸, cyber attacks on Estonia in 2007 (the most important recent cyber war, which was led by a group of young pro-Kremlin⁹), the military operation of Russia in Chechnya, which have shown that computer systems are an important component of future wars, so concrete legislative measures are needed to limit and eliminate attacks in this area.\nDuring an armed conflict, the cybernetic component unequivocally plays a key role, disrupting the electronic communication systems of combat units; it is a quasi-official part of the military war strategies developed by states.\nJens David; Govern, Kevin; Finkelstein, Claire (2015), Cyberwar. Law and Ethics for Virtual Conflicts, Oxford: Oxford University Press, United Kingdom, pp. 16-17.\n³ Oakley, Jacob G. (2019), Waging cyberwar. technical challenges and operational constraints, New York: Apress Publishing, USA, pp. 114.\n⁴ For details on the steps to be taken in cyber attack, see Oakley, Jacob G., op.cit., pp. 116-130.\n⁵ Moreover, the award decision must weigh operationally other concerns, political ramifications, strategic impacts and even moral dilemmas.\n⁶ Carr, Jeffrey (2012), Inside Cyber Warfare. Mapping the cyberunderworld, Sebastopol, California: O'Reilly Media Inc., p. 8.\n⁷ Covert cyber actions can be of two general types: (1) propaganda and misinformation that would be the subject of psychological operations to manipulate the evolution of the real armed conflict; and, (2) actions to shut down the computer networks of the target countries ⁸ On the cyber side of the war in Georgia, coordinated by www.stopGeorgia.info (located in Germany) and www.stopGeorgia.ru (located in the USA), see, José Rios, Maria; Tenreiro de Magalhães, Sérgio; Santos, Leonel, The Georgia's cyberwar, available at www.researchgate.net. The attacks consisted mainly of SQL Injection and DDoS actions.\n⁹ The immediate cause of the cyber attacks on Estonia was the Estonian government's decision to move a war memorial of the Soviet Army from central Tallinn, the capital of Estonia. Many Estonians see the memorial as a harsh reminder of the former Soviet Union's\"occupation\"of Estonia, while many Russians see the statue as a memorial to the Red Army's sacrifices in liberating Estonia from Nazi Germany.\nJournal of Law and Public Administration Volume VIII, Issue 15, 2022 There are multi-national private hackers (nonstate hackers or patriotic hackers) secretly hired by states to move the real origin and responsibility for plausible deniability, while they enjoy the results of the attackers and support them. these by providing the necessary resources¹⁰.\nThus, in times of armed conflict or political tension between states, some members of a state's citizens may be motivated to support the country's war or political effort by taking direct action on the cyber component of the enemy involved in the conflict. Hackers (\"patriotic hackers\") are private citizens qualified in cyber attack capabilities, who can initiate a cyber attack against another state on their own. They may do so without the consent, direction or control of the State to which they belong or in whose territory they are located¹¹. However, there have been incidents in which it is suspected that hacktivists were encouraged and aided by the state, being used as proxies (eg the 2007 cyber attack on Estonia, attributed by the West to Russia)¹².\nRegardless of the origin of the perpetrator, cyber attacks in the context of an armed conflict can have the following objectives: a) Exposing current realities (eg in 2008 in the context of the Israeli-led war against Palestine, Israeli hackers penetrated Palestinian TV and radio stations, inserting scenes with the death of Palestinian leaders).\nb) Implement malicious attack programs on unmanned military drones (eg Conficker C virus) frequently used in armed conflict, compared to the reality that military units understand the strategic and tactical need for unmanned aerial systems (UAS), making them an integral part of their arsenal of monitoring or even attacking the enemy¹³.\nb) The paralysis of the targeted websites for certain periods of time and the blocking of the normal activity of some critical institutions of the state, with indirect consequences on the public services, including of some smaller businesses / firms; attackers can change the language used by the attacked sites or the IP address (eg in the 2008 Gaza war - the\"cast lead\"operation), or post messages against the war or with the dead violence.\nc) indirectly causing material damage to the institutions or legal or even natural persons concerned - even by restricting regular access to the Internet, by attacks on governmental (political¹⁴) or commercial sites, or by silencing political opponents.\nFor example, in the 2009 elections in Iran, when the government decided to shut down the internet in the country in order to stop the massive protests of election fraud, carried out through Facebook and Twitter, in a context in which hackers from opposition parties would have launched DDoS attacks on government sites.\nd) collecting relevant data sought by penetrating networks, including by creating fictitious pages (phishing) or fictitious groups on social networks - communication (eg, Facebook, Telegram) to influence the mood of the population concerned.\nThe purpose is to shape and control public opinion about how events actually unfolded by DDoS, SQL Injection, or Crosssite scripting (XSS) attacks on government sites (Government, Banks, Parliament, Ministries, Lines). communication, embassy websites) ¹⁰ We emphasize that international law presupposes that armed conflict is initiated only by states (as subjects of law) and not by groups or individuals.\n¹¹ Demonstrating a link between non-state actors, hacktivists and the beneficiary government can be difficult, sometimes impossible or takes too long to confirm that the competent legal authority of the target state can take swift response.\n¹² As we will see in the section on the attribution and imputability of cyber attacks, according to international law, if patriotic hackers carry out a cyber attack against another state that rises to the level of an\"armed attack\", the victim state has the legal right, acting inself-defense, to use force against those hackers.\n¹³ From missiles armed with missiles or bombs to so-called traditional ammunition drones (also known as kamikaze drones), this unmanned technology completes many new challenges and opens up a whole new set of possibilities for armed forces around the world.\n¹⁴ Politically motivated cyber attacks range in sophistication, from small-scale denial of simple attacks to well-organized and covert espionage attacks. The sophistication of a cyber attack depends on the skill of the attackers and the amount of reconnaissance performed before the attack. For considerations regarding cyber warfare capabilities in Australia, Brazil, Canada, North Korea, Estonia, Czech Republic, France, Germany, India, Iran, Israel, Italy, Kenya, NATO, China, Pakistan, etc. - see Carr, Jeffrey, op.cit., pp. 243 - 262. An example of a political attack is during the 2009 Nigerian elections to control election information.\nJournal of Law and Public Administration Volume VIII, Issue 15, 2022 e) for recognizing and imposing a supremacy between cyber hackers, taking advantage of the context of kinetic conflict. For example, during the 2006-2008 Gaza war (eg Team Evil, Cold Zero, - formats for resistance to the Gaza war).\nThis notoriety can also occur through the acquisition of cyber attacks during major social crises or key moments in society (eg presidential elections, change of political regime). Among those known, Team Hell - a group of hackers with political or religious orientations, Agd_Scorp, Jurm Team, C-H Team, Gaza Hacker Team, DNS Team, DZ Team, etc. were mentioned in the literature¹⁵.\nf) to transmit signals of the cyber capacity of a state, to other states in conflict or competition (eg in 2009, on the day of the USA were attacked several strategic sites, of some government institutions and of some private companies - which carries out contracts with the state on military projects, in this sense being suspected North Korea).\ng) the insertion of sophisticated viruses in the target computers, for the exploitation of resources or the search for classified information, and if the compromised computer system is part of a larger network, the attacker obtains access to the main network; it takes advantage of the fact that antivirus technology simply cannot keep pace with known threats, much less those they are unaware of¹⁶.\nIn the case of armed (kinetic) conflicts, the targets of interest (cyber bullets) include hubs and other crucial links in the system that move enemy troops involved in the war, such as ports, airports, means of transport, battlefield facilities and communications. Targets could include computer systems located in the enemy state or abroad, command and control nodes, spatial information, surveillance, and means of recognition and communication, command, control and information systems.\nOne such example is cyber attacks on tanks used in a pending military operation, in which a state may have a cyber weapon capable of harming its enemy's tanks. Tanks are equipped with computerized weapon systems in today's armies and could be susceptible to cyber attacks¹⁷. A single cyber weapon may be able to stop the controls of the electric motor or the tank, virtually eliminating it from combat. Another cyber weapon can attack the warhead reinforcement system or the targeting system for the same purpose. Both effects are considered cyber attacks.\nPredictably, cyber attacks will target telecommunications infrastructure (e.g., a virus designed to shut off power to military installations), transportation infrastructure, secure networks, the economy, energy (generating blackouts), security breaches, and disabling security breaches. programs to protect the targeted systems, sometimes leaving graffiti behind in the attacked sites (containing information about certain exposed individuals) or on the main page, the online banking payment systems.\nAs a way of action, hack tek strategies are developed by organized crime in cyber underground labs and usually start by attacking individual servers or computers by infecting with Trojan viruses, such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)¹⁸ and SQL Injection.\nThe more advanced the technology, the more attacks appeared in forms not previously covered by official statements and state practices.\nCyber attacks come in many different forms, their destructive potential being limited only by the creativity and skill of the attackers behind them, and usually a kinetic attack is combined with a support cyber attack. Although it may seem intuitive that cyberattacks may constitute armed attacks, especially in light of their indirect ability to injure or kill, the legal ¹⁵ For details on the profile of these groups of hackers and their guidelines, see Carr, Jeffrey, op.cit., pp. 22-27.\n¹⁶ Often, the selection of the target is given two main considerations: the value of the information that will be obtained and the difficulty of success in operation (to exclude the probability of detection).\n¹⁷ The same goes for intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). ICBM launchers are developed within the limits of state secrecy and can essentially hit anywhere in the world in the execution of an attack. Although countermeasures capable of intercepting ICBMs have been developed, some states, such as Russia and North Korea, have recently announced that they have developed models that cannot be intercepted at this time (eg Sarmat / Satan 2, in the case of Russia).\n¹⁸ DDoS attacks typically disrupt communications and computing capabilities by sending huge amounts of (sometimes malformed) traffic to devices to alter or deny their ability to function as originally intended. They are common on the Internet because they are relatively unsophisticated and can be targeted from an Internet presence point in the cyberspace of one state against one in another enemy state.\nJournal of Law and Public Administration Volume VIII, Issue 15, 2022 community has been reluctant to take this approach, as cyberattacks do not resemble traditional armed attacks with conventional weapons, having another specific manifestation¹⁹.\nThe exploitation of computer systems in cyber warfare is, in fact, an exploitation of the human errors of those who thought and built them into their elements - ways of exploiting, reconfiguring or overwriting computer programs (eg, a virtual gateway which uses facial recognition is altered, nullifying the image component, or a cyber attack that corrupts the hard disks of the surveillance cameras where their recordings are stored, or the steering systems of some devices engaged in kinetic warfare).",
    "## III. Establishing the responsibility of the state for cyber attacks carried out on its territory States may not respond to a cross-border cyber attack by force without first establishing the State's responsibility for the attack. Although historically this has meant that an attack has taken place, to be attributed to a state or its agents, direct control of an attack is no longer a requirement of state responsibility. Today, international law is based on the responsibility of a state and only on the breach of its international obligations to prevent and combat it.": "This change is particularly important for cyber attacks, as the prevailing view is that cross-border cyber attacks should be treated as a criminal matter rather than a national security issue, and this seems to be based on the historical view of state responsibility. This limited view of state responsibility blocks attacked states in the response crisis by requiring states to attribute cyber attacks to a state or its agents before responding through active defenses, even if the likelihood of successfully assigning a ranged attack is generally uncertain. Consequently, states in crisis in response to a cyber attack act under the false assumption that they must decide between effective but illegal active defenses and the less effective but legal path of passive defenses and the scope of domestic criminal law.\nGiven the perspective of state responsibility, states should first determine whether the cyber attack can be blamed on the home state. Once a cyber attack is blamed on a state and that state refuses to comply with its international obligations, the legal barriers to self-defense action disappear.\nWith regard to cyber attacks, the accepted principles of common *jus ad bellum* still support the imputation of state responsibility for armed attacks by non-state actors when the attacks come from a state that allows non-state actors to carry out criminal operations within their borders. States that allow non-state actors to carry out these operations are in breach of their duty to prevent attacks on other states and are known as\"sanctuary states\". This is extremely important for cyber-attack states because when a cyber-attack comes from a sanctuary state, a victim-state can use active defenses and avoid crisis response.\nTherefore, we need to understand the answers to two key questions: - What does a state's duty to prevent cyber attacks mean?\nThis obligation in fact includes several smaller tasks to prevent cyber attacks, including the adoption of strict criminal laws, the vigorous enforcement of investigative procedures, the prosecution of attackers and, during the investigation and prosecution, cooperation with cyber-attack states. These are the duties of all states and are binding as customary international law. The authority for these duties comes from all three sources of international tradition in the field of law - international conventions, international customs and general principles of law common to civilized nations, as evidenced by the judgments and teachings of the most qualified international lawyers.\nThe only international treaty analogous to cybernetics is the European Convention on Cybercrime in 2001²⁰. Although the treaty is only a regional agreement, it is still very influential on customary international law because of the importance of the states that have ratified it, originating from the doctrine of the states particularly affected.\n--- ¹⁹Unlike conventional warfare, an autonomous and exclusive act of warfare in the cyber realm is difficult to conceive.\n²⁰Available at www.eur-lex.europa.eu.The Cybercrime Convention requires its parties to establish\"criminal\"offences for almost every conceivable type of cyber attack, in accordance with their domestic law.\nJournal of Law and Public Administration Volume VIII, Issue 15, 2022 In addition, it demonstrates the recognition by states of both the need to criminalize cyber attacks and the obligation of states to prevent their territory from being used by non-state actors to conduct cyber attacks against other states. The convention is also significant because it recognizes that cyber attacks cannot be banned during an attack, and the only way to prevent them is through aggressive law enforcement, coupled with state cooperation.\nInternational Terrorist Terrorism Treaties provide additional, albeit indirect, support for the duty to prevent cyber attacks. The international community recognizes terrorism as a threat to international peace and security, but no agreement has been reached on a definition. As a result, states have increasingly taken the approach of outlawing certain acts of terrorism - terrorists are constantly developing new methods of attack, rather than outlawing terrorism itself.\nThese treaties impose on states several common requirements regarding terrorist attacks, such as taking all practicable measures to prevent such attacks, criminalizing attacks, referring cases to the competent authorities for prosecution, and obliging states to cooperate with each other during criminal proceedings[21]. Although these treaties do not address cyber attacks, the principles contained therein contribute to influencing state requirements under customary international law on terrorism. As there is growing evidence that cyberattacks will soon be an active weapon for terrorists, states should refer to the common principles found in these treaties as opinio juris when cyberattacks are used as a terrorist weapon.\n- What must a state do to avoid violating its duty to prevent?\nThe treatment of cyber attacks in accordance with their criminal law also proves the recognition of the duty of states to prevent cyber attacks. Many states criminalize such acts and prosecute cyber attacks to discourage attackers from committing law enforcement, which seems to be the only way to protect and prevent damage to their computer systems.\nThis gives credibility to the notion that, unlike a conventional attack, which can be stopped after detection, cyber attacks can only be stopped by setting ex ante barriers that attackers are trying to cross. Moreover, these practices demonstrate a growing acceptance among states that cyber attacks must be stopped and that the way to do this is to enforce the law[22].\nStates' responses to transnational terrorist attacks further support the recognition of a duty to prevent cyber attacks under customary international law. This involves the difficult task of analyzing data and clues about the existence and extent of such attacks[23].\nThe more cyber attacks resemble terrorism, the easier it will be to fit into the paradigm built to deal with transnational terrorism. However, regardless of their purpose, cyber attacks pose a threat to international peace and security and should be treated as a category of other recognized transnational threats.\nThe general principles of law common to civilized nations also support the recognition of the duty to prevent cyber attacks. It is a well-established principle in the domestic law of most states that individuals should be held liable for acts or omissions that have a causal link to the harm suffered by another person. While international law is not bound by the domestic laws of states, international law can be derived from the general principles common to the great legal systems of the world. Most states use causality as a principle for establishing individual responsibility, giving credibility to the idea that the responsibility of a state should also be based on causation[24].\nCyber attacks are extremely difficult for states to detect before committing a particular attack, and are often committed by individuals or groups who are not even on a state's radar. However, just because cyberattacks are difficult 21Cyberspace, as a global electronic medium, cannot be dominated or controlled by a single nation.\n22Carr, Jeffrey, op. cit., p. 64.\n23For details on this issue and the analysis techniques that could be used, see Petersson, Gustav Jakob; Breul, Jonathan D. (2017), Cyber Society, Big Data, andxs Evaluation, Comparative Policy Evaluation, Volume 24 (colective papers), USA, pp. 47-75.\n24States's responsibility for negligence in taking all reasonable measures to prevent crime and to prosecute, prosecute and bring to justice transnational cybercriminals has also been recognized in international justice, such as the International Court of Justice. See, in this regard, Carr, Jeffrey, op.cit., p. 67.\nJournal of Law and Public Administration Volume VIII, Issue 15, 2022 to prevent does not mean that states can breach their duty to prevent them, and by enforcing the law vigorously, they will deter cyberattacks. States that do not enact such laws do not fulfill their duty to prevent cyberattacks²⁵.\nA state's passivity and indifference to cyber attacks make it a sanctuary state, from which attackers can operate safely. When viewed in this light, it becomes clear that a state can be held indirectly responsible for cyber attacks in accordance with the established principles of customary international law.\nHost states will be judged on their efforts to catch and prosecute cyber-attackers, which is likely to be the main way in which states can deter and prevent future attacks. When victim states end up judging whether a host state has complied with its international obligations, the host states must cooperate with the former to ensure their transparency and good faith.\nOnce a host state proves that it is a sanctuary state by its inaction, the other states can blame it for cyber attacks originating in its territory. At that point, the host state becomes responsible for the cyber attack that triggered the initial investigation, as well as for all future cyber attacks that come from its borders. This opens the door for a victim state to use active defenses against the servers of the computers involved during a cyber attack.\nWhen attacks are carried out, most often by non-state actors, across state borders, attracting international responsibility (usually indirect), in this case, begins with an analysis of whether the armed attacks of non-state actors fall under the law of war continues with the duties that states have towards each other with regard to non-state actors on their territory²⁶, then moves on to ways of imputing state responsibility for the acts of non-state actors and ends with the legality of cross-border response operations against states²⁷.\nThus, a state's passivity or indifference to a non-state agent on its own territory could trigger its liability, possibly to the same extent, as if it had actively participated in the planning, an involvement that can be established by an analysis. post facto whether the state could have put more effort into preventing the cyber attack.\nBased on the above, it is clear that victim states can respond by force to armed attacks by non-state actors located in another state when host states violate their duty to prevent such attacks. If supplemented by cyber attacks, imputing state responsibility in this way gives states a legal way to use active defenses without the need to separately assign an attack to the state or its agents. In fact, imputation of liability is the equivalent of attributing the attack to the state or its agents.\nTherefore, in this case, it is essential to establish and explain why cyberattacks are armed attacks, which is the duty of a state to prevent cyberattacks, and the means and circumstances that would allow a victim state to respond by force to a cyber attack.\nMoreover, the attribution requirement perpetuates the\"response crisis\"because it is virtually impossible to attribute cyber attacks during the attack. Although states can track cyberattacks retroactively to the servers of computers in another state, conclusively establishing the identity of the attacker requires intensive investigation, which requires time and the help of the home state.\nGiven the ban on forcibly responding until an attack has been attributed to a state or its agents, coupled with the fact that the vast majority of cyber attacks are conducted by non-state actors, it should come as no surprise that states are reluctant to deal with cyber attacks as acts of war, thus risking violations of international law. This\"assignment issue\"blocks states in response²⁸.\n²⁵ Carr, Jeffrey, op.cit., p. 67.\n²⁶ It is a long-established principle of international law that a state is obliged to use diligence to prevent the commission of criminal acts against another nation or its people. Recognized in several international acts, the principle implies that a state cannot knowingly allow its territory to be used for actions contrary to the rights of other states. Of course, there is no absolute obligation on the host state to prevent all cyber attacks on its territory, but when a host state has the capacity to prevent an armed attack by non-state actors on its territory, it fails to do so. This violates its duty of prevention under international law.\n²⁷ For details on these stages, see Carr, Jeffrey, op.cit., p. 53 et seq.\n²⁸ For a graphic evolution, see Carr, Jeffrey, op.cit., p. 47.\nJournal of Law and Public Administration Volume VIII, Issue 15, 2022 Early detection and warning programs can help capture cyber attacks before they reach their climax, but even the best programs are not able to detect all cyber attacks.\nWhen an ongoing cyber attack has already caused a serious, immediate, invasive, direct, and measurable damage, it can be safely classified as an armed attack, even if it is still ongoing. On the other hand, when an attack did not cause such damage, the system administrator will have to consider: (1) a possible immediate future injury, (2) the likelihood of avoiding the attack with purely defensive measures, respectively (3) whether the attack should be classified as an imminent armed attack.\nAfter all, the state can avoid being the target of active defenses²⁹ from another state, even when the attacks come from its territory, by taking concrete measures to prevent cyber attacks, such as the implementation of cyber attacks. Of the legal framework on crime, the application of these laws and cooperation with victim states to bring the attackers to justice. In this endeavor, the human element, with all its strengths and weaknesses, is paramount.\nStates that violate their duty to prevent cyber attacks and refuse to change their practices should be held accountable - at least indirectly - for all subsequent attacks that come from within their borders, in accordance with the law of war. At a time when cyber attacks are threatening global security and states are struggling to find ways to improve their cyber defenses, there is no reason to protect sanctuary states from the legal use of active defenses by victim states, and there is every reason to increase the state's defense against cyber attacks.\nIn other words, states not only enjoy rights, but must also fulfill certain obligations under international law, among which the idea of\"due diligence\"occupies a central place - a state is obliged to use diligence to prevent the commission within the limits its criminal acts against other nations³⁰. This duty of states is continuous, compared to the need to protect other states against harmful acts of individuals - state or non-state actors, individuals or legal entities - launched from within their own jurisdictions (called\"sanctuary states\").\nIn this new age of cyber warfare, the Web is both a battlefield and an information space. Social services such as Twitter, Facebook, MySpace or LiveJournal are an essential part of the hacker's toolkit. Commonly known as the Social Web, these services provide an unprecedented repository of personal data, personal information about people, companies and governments, which can be used for financial crime, espionage and misinformation, both by state hackers and by non-state actors.",
    "## IV. Cyber espionage – an adjacent weapon in cyber warfare?": "Cyber warfare - sometimes called\"bloodless war\"- is closely linked to cybercrime, cyber security, cyber terrorism, cyber espionage, cyberspace, the differentiation between these concepts being sensitive because they are largely intertwined. The armies of the world are struggling to cope with a new field of cyber battle, by delimiting and framing their actions in the sphere of practical applicability of these concepts.\nIt is often impossible to determine whether attempts to hack a computer in another state were acts of cyber warfare or cyber intelligence gathering. Unlike cyber attack activity, the collection of information is not always based on cyber exploitation as a facilitator³¹.\n²⁹ Active defense is the most appropriate type of force to use against cyber attacks in light of jus in bello principles. First of all, in terms of military necessity, active defense is probably the full force needed to carry out the mission of defending against a cyber attack. Active defense can track down an attack at the source and immediately annihilate it, while kinetic weapons will be slower and less effective than the speed of a hack-back. Therefore, the use of kinetic weapons to the detriment of active defense will not only be less effective, but will also violate the principle of necessity by employing force only for the sake of destruction. In addition, the choice between active defense versus kinetic weapons should reduce the possibility of escalating these situations on a large scale in armed conflicts between states.\n³⁰ Maurer, Tim (2018). Cyber mercenaries, The State, Hackers and Power, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, p. 130. The author refers to the jurisprudence of the International Court of Justice which stated that\"it is the obligation of each state not to knowingly allow the territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other states.\"³¹ For methods of collecting information in the virtual environment, see Oakley, Jacob G, op.cit., pp. 96 - 97. And for the relationship between cyber intelligence gathering, cyber reconnaissance and cyber attacks, broadly, op.cit., pp. 102-108.\nJournal of Law and Public Administration Volume VIII, Issue 15, 2022 In international law, cyberespionage has been defined as\"the practice of spying or using spies to obtain information about the plans and activities of a foreign government or a competing company\"³².\nAnother interesting thing about espionage is that it is not always sponsored or initiated by the enemy state. In fact, in many cases of espionage around the world, the person who collects information and transmits it to foreign powers has done so of his own free will, sometimes out of revenge and sometimes for reasons of financial compensation, or for other philosophical and ethical reasons.\nCyberespionage may seem similar, but it is different from a motivational point of view, with cyber manipulation activities. Manipulation, as a form of cyber attack, consists of controlling or modifying information, information systems and / or networks in cyberspace to create physical effects of denial, using deception, bait, conditioning, forgery, and other similar techniques. Use your opponent's information resources for the purpose of apparent friendship, to create clues that do not appear immediately in cyberspace. The targeted network may appear to be operating normally until side or tertiary effects occur, including proven physical effects of the attack³³.",
    "## V. Conclusions No change in technology so far, however, seems to rival the potential for transformation as much as the development of offensive cyber capabilities. Indeed, this is demonstrated by the invention of a new label for the notion of war involving cyber attacks, namely\"cyber warfare\", as if it were not just a new type of weapon, but a whole new kind of war.": "In the circumstances of the armed / classical war, the growing importance of both military and personal data or otherwise protected by law is obvious. In an age when individuals voluntarily understand how to transmit, store, and receive large amounts of personal data over the Internet, planting software in electronic devices to erase, modify, or approximate data is becoming a crucial new tactic of war: a\"fifth dimension battlefield\", as it is often said in doctrine, after air, sea, earth and outer space³⁴.\nThis change in staff has led to the merger of military and corporate espionage functions, and as a result, the militarization of cyberspace has created legal and moral ambiguity regarding privacy rights, as well as a personal responsibility to be targeted in cyberspace. virtue of the simple position it occupies in relation to an information network.\nThese tendencies contributed to the change in the structure of the war, with the result that the line distinction between the military and the civilian field blurred. Cyber warfare operations thus occupy a crucial position in the changing landscape of military conflict and require prompt response from the victim states, provided that the proportionality and correct identification of attackers and the international legal framework are respected.\nProportionality must be encouraged, for example, because it is a crucial issue in military ethics as well as in common criminal law. It requires that no more force be used than is necessary to repel an attack or to fulfill other legitimate objectives. But how do you determine what constitutes a necessary response to a cyber attack? More importantly, how should we determine if it is ever proportionate to launch an offensive cyber warfare counterattack? There are open-ended questions raised in the relevant literature, to which the practice is to be answered, being undoubtedly that the legitimate collective defense requires a more precise and responsible action against the dangers arising with the evolution of technology and its malicious use for which run counter to individual or collective safety."

Global peace requires at the legal and practical level a firm reaction against their use, but with the observance of rules and limits of the intensity of the force used, including the real need and proportionality.\nThe study seeks to establish some guidelines under the mentioned aspects, far from being widely accepted in current legal and political doctrines, and can be a starting point in developing a predictable legislative framework effective, effective in action and decisive in preserving the real sense of security individual and collective.\nKeywords: cyber attacks; war; armed conflict; responsibility; state.\n# I. Introduction\nThe presence of cybernetics in the modern life of states is a reality that can no longer be ignored, bringing undeniable benefits to people's well-being, but being accompanied by certain risks, the most important of which is the use of technological advantages for criminal or illicit purposes in general. The risk is real and it can already be seen empirically that in the case of recent armed conflicts (for example, the Russia-Ukraine conflict that began on February 24, 2022), the cyber component is not only used consistently, but is and targeted by attacks of the same nature by combatants.\nIt is important to note that, while the term \"cyber attack\" is often used in the literature, to date, all but a few effects of offensive cyber operations have remained below the level considered to be the use of force or armed attack, within the meaning of the provisions of the United Nations Charter. Moreover, malicious cyber activity can take place over an extended period of time - months, if not years - and is often not detected. For this reason, such activity is therefore better described as \"cyber operations\" than as \"attack.\"1.\nIn the military and international law, there are heated discussions about possible situations in which cyber attacks can be qualified as acts of war in themselves, especially when they take place during actual armed attacks. However, it is true that the increasing emergence of cyber attacks and the introduction of new technologies in the military and electronics industry have led to a fundamental change in the features that previously characterized acts of pure kinetic warfare, so it may seem necessary to adapt the law of war and international humanitarian law. which must evolve just as fast2.\nJournal of Law and Public Administration\nVolume VIII, Issue 15, 2022\n## II. Cyber Attacks. Specific and content\nIn order to keep the internet safe and peaceful, it is vital to establish the constitutive content of cyber attacks, the manner of manifestation and the targets primarily targeted, so that they can be recognized when they occur or, ideally, in time.\nIdentifying the real actors behind a cyber attack is a notoriously difficult task, which increases exponentially in the event of an armed conflict. Attributing attacks to individual actors (states or international organizations, or private actors) is traditionally seen as an acid test to determine whether an attack is assessed as an act of cyber warfare that complements kinetic warfare, or just an act. conjunctural of cyber terrorism (\"cyber hooliganism\").\nCyber attribution is the act of tying together cyber activities in such an aggression, based on their attributes, to determine if they come from the same actor, the most difficult part being determining the motivation of the latter. The logical attribution process consists of 4 steps: a) Discovering the indicators of compromise of the attacked systems - by administering evidence of unauthorized activity in a network or organization, b) Associating them together as belonging to specific actors based on their attributes, c) Precise identification of the actor, d) determination of the actor's motivation.\nThe assignment process can target a particular unit, organization, or even individual behind the cyber activity. The award process is particularly important in this situation, in which, without identity and motivation, it is not possible to know who the enemy is and, implicitly, how to be annihilated with an active or passive response, tactical or technical, from the victim state.\nUnlike weapons of mass destruction, cyber attacks are \"weapons of mass iritation\" and can cause a \"computer pandemic,\" and in the event of an armed conflict, they are non-physical in nature.\nCyber attacks are generally non-public and usually target government or private institutions, usually major financial institutions affecting public confidence in Internet-mediated transactions, severely disrupting their critical infrastructure and security architecture.\nAmong the most publicized in recent years are cyber attacks in the 2008 Russia-Georgia conflict, cyber attacks on Estonia in 2007 (the most important recent cyber war, which was led by a group of young pro-Kremlin), the military operation of Russia in Chechnya, which have shown that computer systems are an important component of future wars, so concrete legislative measures are needed to limit and eliminate attacks in this area.\nDuring an armed conflict, the cybernetic component unequivocally plays a key role, disrupting the electronic communication systems of combat units; it is a quasi-official part of the military war strategies developed by states.\nJens David; Govern, Kevin; Finkelstein, Claire (2015), Cyberwar. Law and Ethics for Virtual Conflicts, Oxford: Oxford University Press, United Kingdom, pp. 16-17.\n Oakley, Jacob G. (2019), Waging cyberwar. technical challenges and operational constraints, New York: Apress Publishing, USA, pp. 114.\n For details on the steps to be taken in cyber attack, see Oakley, Jacob G., op.cit., pp. 116-130.\n Moreover, the award decision must weigh operationally other concerns, political ramifications, strategic impacts and even moral dilemmas.\n Carr, Jeffrey (2012), Inside Cyber Warfare. Mapping the cyberunderworld, Sebastopol, California: O'Reilly Media Inc., p. 8.\n Covert cyber actions can be of two general types: (1) propaganda and misinformation that would be the subject of psychological operations to manipulate the evolution of the real armed conflict; and, (2) actions to shut down the computer networks of the target countries\n On the cyber side of the war in Georgia, coordinated by www.stopGeorgia.info (located in Germany) and www.stopGeorgia.ru (located in the USA), see, José Rios, Maria; Tenreiro de Magalhães, Sérgio; Santos, Leonel, The Georgia's cyberwar, available at www.researchgate.net. The attacks consisted mainly of SQL Injection and DDoS actions.\n The immediate cause of the cyber attacks on Estonia was the Estonian government's decision to move a war memorial of the Soviet Army from central Tallinn, the capital of Estonia. Many Estonians see the memorial as a harsh reminder of the former Soviet Union's \"occupation\" of Estonia, while many Russians see the statue as a memorial to the Red Army's sacrifices in liberating Estonia from Nazi Germany.\nJournal of Law and Public Administration\nVolume VIII, Issue 15, 2022\nThere are multi-national private hackers (nonstate hackers or patriotic hackers) secretly hired by states to move the real origin and responsibility for plausible deniability, while they enjoy the results of the attackers and support them. these by providing the necessary resources.\nThus, in times of armed conflict or political tension between states, some members of a state's citizens may be motivated to support the country's war or political effort by taking direct action on the cyber component of the enemy involved in the conflict. Hackers (\"patriotic hackers\") are private citizens qualified in cyber attack capabilities, who can initiate a cyber attack against another state on their own. They may do so without the consent, direction or control of the State to which they belong or in whose territory they are located. However, there have been incidents in which it is suspected that hacktivists were encouraged and aided by the state, being used as proxies (eg the 2007 cyber attack on Estonia, attributed by the West to Russia).\nRegardless of the origin of the perpetrator, cyber attacks in the context of an armed conflict can have the following objectives:\na) Exposing current realities (eg in 2008 in the context of the Israeli-led war against Palestine, Israeli hackers penetrated Palestinian TV and radio stations, inserting scenes with the death of Palestinian leaders).\nb) Implement malicious attack programs on unmanned military drones (eg Conficker C virus) frequently used in armed conflict, compared to the reality that military units understand the strategic and tactical need for unmanned aerial systems (UAS), making them an integral part of their arsenal of monitoring or even attacking the enemy.\nb) The paralysis of the targeted websites for certain periods of time and the blocking of the normal activity of some critical institutions of the state, with indirect consequences on the public services, including of some smaller businesses / firms; attackers can change the language used by the attacked sites or the IP address (eg in the 2008 Gaza war - the \"cast lead\" operation), or post messages against the war or with the dead violence.\nc) indirectly causing material damage to the institutions or legal or even natural persons concerned - even by restricting regular access to the Internet, by attacks on governmental (political) or commercial sites, or by silencing political opponents.\nFor example, in the 2009 elections in Iran, when the government decided to shut down the internet in the country in order to stop the massive protests of election fraud, carried out through Facebook and Twitter, in a context in which hackers from opposition parties would have launched DDoS attacks on government sites.\nd) collecting relevant data sought by penetrating networks, including by creating fictitious pages (phishing) or fictitious groups on social networks - communication (eg, Facebook, Telegram) to influence the mood of the population concerned.\nThe purpose is to shape and control public opinion about how events actually unfolded by DDoS, SQL Injection, or Crosssite scripting (XSS) attacks on government sites (Government, Banks, Parliament, Ministries, Lines). communication, embassy websites)\n We emphasize that international law presupposes that armed conflict is initiated only by states (as subjects of law) and not by groups or individuals.\n Demonstrating a link between non-state actors, hacktivists and the beneficiary government can be difficult, sometimes impossible or takes too long to confirm that the competent legal authority of the target state can take swift response.\n As we will see in the section on the attribution and imputability of cyber attacks, according to international law, if patriotic hackers carry out a cyber attack against another state that rises to the level of an \"armed attack\", the victim state has the legal right, acting inself-defense, to use force against those hackers.\n From missiles armed with missiles or bombs to so-called traditional ammunition drones (also known as kamikaze drones), this unmanned technology completes many new challenges and opens up a whole new set of possibilities for armed forces around the world.\n Politically motivated cyber attacks range in sophistication, from small-scale denial of simple attacks to well-organized and covert espionage attacks. The sophistication of a cyber attack depends on the skill of the attackers and the amount of reconnaissance performed before the attack. For considerations regarding cyber warfare capabilities in Australia, Brazil, Canada, North Korea, Estonia, Czech Republic, France, Germany, India, Iran, Israel, Italy, Kenya, NATO, China, Pakistan, etc. - see Carr, Jeffrey, op.cit., pp. 243 - 262. An example of a political attack is during the 2009 Nigerian elections to control election information.\nJournal of Law and Public Administration\nVolume VIII, Issue 15, 2022\ne) for recognizing and imposing a supremacy between cyber hackers, taking advantage of the context of kinetic conflict. For example, during the 2006-2008 Gaza war (eg Team Evil, Cold Zero, - formats for resistance to the Gaza war).\nThis notoriety can also occur through the acquisition of cyber attacks during major social crises or key moments in society (eg presidential elections, change of political regime). Among those known, Team Hell - a group of hackers with political or religious orientations, Agd_Scorp, Jurm Team, C-H Team, Gaza Hacker Team, DNS Team, DZ Team, etc. were mentioned in the literature.\nf) to transmit signals of the cyber capacity of a state, to other states in conflict or competition (eg in 2009, on the day of the USA were attacked several strategic sites, of some government institutions and of some private companies - which carries out contracts with the state on military projects, in this sense being suspected North Korea).\ng) the insertion of sophisticated viruses in the target computers, for the exploitation of resources or the search for classified information, and if the compromised computer system is part of a larger network, the attacker obtains access to the main network; it takes advantage of the fact that antivirus technology simply cannot keep pace with known threats, much less those they are unaware of.\nIn the case of armed (kinetic) conflicts, the targets of interest (cyber bullets) include hubs and other crucial links in the system that move enemy troops involved in the war, such as ports, airports, means of transport, battlefield facilities and communications. Targets could include computer systems located in the enemy state or abroad, command and control nodes, spatial information, surveillance, and means of recognition and communication, command, control and information systems.\nOne such example is cyber attacks on tanks used in a pending military operation, in which a state may have a cyber weapon capable of harming its enemy's tanks. Tanks are equipped with computerized weapon systems in today's armies and could be susceptible to cyber attacks. A single cyber weapon may be able to stop the controls of the electric motor or the tank, virtually eliminating it from combat. Another cyber weapon can attack the warhead reinforcement system or the targeting system for the same purpose. Both effects are considered cyber attacks.\nPredictably, cyber attacks will target telecommunications infrastructure (e.g., a virus designed to shut off power to military installations), transportation infrastructure, secure networks, the economy, energy (generating blackouts), security breaches, and disabling security breaches. programs to protect the targeted systems, sometimes leaving graffiti behind in the attacked sites (containing information about certain exposed individuals) or on the main page, the online banking payment systems.\nAs a way of action, hack tek strategies are developed by organized crime in cyber underground labs and usually start by attacking individual servers or computers by infecting with Trojan viruses, such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) and SQL Injection.\nThe more advanced the technology, the more attacks appeared in forms not previously covered by official statements and state practices.\nCyber attacks come in many different forms, their destructive potential being limited only by the creativity and skill of the attackers behind them, and usually a kinetic attack is combined with a support cyber attack. Although it may seem intuitive that cyberattacks may constitute armed attacks, especially in light of their indirect ability to injure or kill, the legal\n For details on the profile of these groups of hackers and their guidelines, see Carr, Jeffrey, op.cit., pp. 22-27.\n Often, the selection of the target is given two main considerations: the value of the information that will be obtained and the difficulty of success in operation (to exclude the probability of detection).\n The same goes for intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). ICBM launchers are developed within the limits of state secrecy and can essentially hit anywhere in the world in the execution of an attack. Although countermeasures capable of intercepting ICBMs have been developed, some states, such as Russia and North Korea, have recently announced that they have developed models that cannot be intercepted at this time (eg Sarmat / Satan 2, in the case of Russia).\n DDoS attacks typically disrupt communications and computing capabilities by sending huge amounts of (sometimes malformed) traffic to devices to alter or deny their ability to function as originally intended. They are common on the Internet because they are relatively unsophisticated and can be targeted from an Internet presence point in the cyberspace of one state against one in another enemy state.\nJournal of Law and Public Administration\nVolume VIII, Issue 15, 2022\ncommunity has been reluctant to take this approach, as cyberattacks do not resemble traditional armed attacks with conventional weapons, having another specific manifestation.\nThe exploitation of computer systems in cyber warfare is, in fact, an exploitation of the human errors of those who thought and built them into their elements - ways of exploiting, reconfiguring or overwriting computer programs (eg, a virtual gateway which uses facial recognition is altered, nullifying the image component, or a cyber attack that corrupts the hard disks of the surveillance cameras where their recordings are stored, or the steering systems of some devices engaged in kinetic warfare).\n## III. Establishing the responsibility of the state for cyber attacks carried out on its territory\nStates may not respond to a cross-border cyber attack by force without first establishing the State's responsibility for the attack. Although historically this has meant that an attack has taken place, to be attributed to a state or its agents, direct control of an attack is no longer a requirement of state responsibility. Today, international law is based on the responsibility of a state and only on the breach of its international obligations to prevent and combat it.\nThis change is particularly important for cyber attacks, as the prevailing view is that cross-border cyber attacks should be treated as a criminal matter rather than a national security issue, and this seems to be based on the historical view of state responsibility. This limited view of state responsibility blocks attacked states in the response crisis by requiring states to attribute cyber attacks to a state or its agents before responding through active defenses, even if the likelihood of successfully assigning a ranged attack is generally uncertain. Consequently, states in crisis in response to a cyber attack act under the false assumption that they must decide between effective but illegal active defenses and the less effective but legal path of passive defenses and the scope of domestic criminal law.\nGiven the perspective of state responsibility, states should first determine whether the cyber attack can be blamed on the home state. Once a cyber attack is blamed on a state and that state refuses to comply with its international obligations, the legal barriers to self-defense action disappear.\nWith regard to cyber attacks, the accepted principles of common *jus ad bellum* still support the imputation of state responsibility for armed attacks by non-state actors when the attacks come from a state that allows non-state actors to carry out criminal operations within their borders. States that allow non-state actors to carry out these operations are in breach of their duty to prevent attacks on other states and are known as \"sanctuary states\". This is extremely important for cyber-attack states because when a cyber-attack comes from a sanctuary state, a victim-state can use active defenses and avoid crisis response.\nTherefore, we need to understand the answers to two key questions:\n- What does a state's duty to prevent cyber attacks mean?\nThis obligation in fact includes several smaller tasks to prevent cyber attacks, including the adoption of strict criminal laws, the vigorous enforcement of investigative procedures, the prosecution of attackers and, during the investigation and prosecution, cooperation with cyber-attack states. These are the duties of all states and are binding as customary international law. The authority for these duties comes from all three sources of international tradition in the field of law - international conventions, international customs and general principles of law common to civilized nations, as evidenced by the judgments and teachings of the most qualified international lawyers.\nThe only international treaty analogous to cybernetics is the European Convention on Cybercrime in 2001. Although the treaty is only a regional agreement, it is still very influential on customary international law because of the importance of the states that have ratified it, originating from the doctrine of the states particularly affected.\n---\nUnlike conventional warfare, an autonomous and exclusive act of warfare in the cyber realm is difficult to conceive.\nAvailable at www.eur-lex.europa.eu.The Cybercrime Convention requires its parties to establish \"criminal\" offences for almost every conceivable type of cyber attack, in accordance with their domestic law.\nJournal of Law and Public Administration\nVolume VIII, Issue 15, 2022\nIn addition, it demonstrates the recognition by states of both the need to criminalize cyber attacks and the obligation of states to prevent their territory from being used by non-state actors to conduct cyber attacks against other states. The convention is also significant because it recognizes that cyber attacks cannot be banned during an attack, and the only way to prevent them is through aggressive law enforcement, coupled with state cooperation.\nInternational Terrorist Terrorism Treaties provide additional, albeit indirect, support for the duty to prevent cyber attacks. The international community recognizes terrorism as a threat to international peace and security, but no agreement has been reached on a definition. As a result, states have increasingly taken the approach of outlawing certain acts of terrorism - terrorists are constantly developing new methods of attack, rather than outlawing terrorism itself.\nThese treaties impose on states several common requirements regarding terrorist attacks, such as taking all practicable measures to prevent such attacks, criminalizing attacks, referring cases to the competent authorities for prosecution, and obliging states to cooperate with each other during criminal proceedings[21]. Although these treaties do not address cyber attacks, the principles contained therein contribute to influencing state requirements under customary international law on terrorism. As there is growing evidence that cyberattacks will soon be an active weapon for terrorists, states should refer to the common principles found in these treaties as opinio juris when cyberattacks are used as a terrorist weapon.\n- What must a state do to avoid violating its duty to prevent?\nThe treatment of cyber attacks in accordance with their criminal law also proves the recognition of the duty of states to prevent cyber attacks. Many states criminalize such acts and prosecute cyber attacks to discourage attackers from committing law enforcement, which seems to be the only way to protect and prevent damage to their computer systems.\nThis gives credibility to the notion that, unlike a conventional attack, which can be stopped after detection, cyber attacks can only be stopped by setting ex ante barriers that attackers are trying to cross. Moreover, these practices demonstrate a growing acceptance among states that cyber attacks must be stopped and that the way to do this is to enforce the law[22].\nStates' responses to transnational terrorist attacks further support the recognition of a duty to prevent cyber attacks under customary international law. This involves the difficult task of analyzing data and clues about the existence and extent of such attacks[23].\nThe more cyber attacks resemble terrorism, the easier it will be to fit into the paradigm built to deal with transnational terrorism. However, regardless of their purpose, cyber attacks pose a threat to international peace and security and should be treated as a category of other recognized transnational threats.\nThe general principles of law common to civilized nations also support the recognition of the duty to prevent cyber attacks. It is a well-established principle in the domestic law of most states that individuals should be held liable for acts or omissions that have a causal link to the harm suffered by another person. While international law is not bound by the domestic laws of states, international law can be derived from the general principles common to the great legal systems of the world. Most states use causality as a principle for establishing individual responsibility, giving credibility to the idea that the responsibility of a state should also be based on causation[24].\nCyber attacks are extremely difficult for states to detect before committing a particular attack, and are often committed by individuals or groups who are not even on a state's radar. However, just because cyberattacks are difficult\n21Cyberspace, as a global electronic medium, cannot be dominated or controlled by a single nation.\n22Carr, Jeffrey, op. cit., p. 64.\n23For details on this issue and the analysis techniques that could be used, see Petersson, Gustav Jakob; Breul, Jonathan D. (2017), Cyber Society, Big Data, andxs Evaluation, Comparative Policy Evaluation, Volume 24 (colective papers), USA, pp. 47-75.\n24States's responsibility for negligence in taking all reasonable measures to prevent crime and to prosecute, prosecute and bring to justice transnational cybercriminals has also been recognized in international justice, such as the International Court of Justice. See, in this regard, Carr, Jeffrey, op.cit., p. 67.\nJournal of Law and Public Administration\nVolume VIII, Issue 15, 2022\nto prevent does not mean that states can breach their duty to prevent them, and by enforcing the law vigorously, they will deter cyberattacks. States that do not enact such laws do not fulfill their duty to prevent cyberattacks.\nA state's passivity and indifference to cyber attacks make it a sanctuary state, from which attackers can operate safely. When viewed in this light, it becomes clear that a state can be held indirectly responsible for cyber attacks in accordance with the established principles of customary international law.\nHost states will be judged on their efforts to catch and prosecute cyber-attackers, which is likely to be the main way in which states can deter and prevent future attacks. When victim states end up judging whether a host state has complied with its international obligations, the host states must cooperate with the former to ensure their transparency and good faith.\nOnce a host state proves that it is a sanctuary state by its inaction, the other states can blame it for cyber attacks originating in its territory. At that point, the host state becomes responsible for the cyber attack that triggered the initial investigation, as well as for all future cyber attacks that come from its borders. This opens the door for a victim state to use active defenses against the servers of the computers involved during a cyber attack.\nWhen attacks are carried out, most often by non-state actors, across state borders, attracting international responsibility (usually indirect), in this case, begins with an analysis of whether the armed attacks of non-state actors fall under the law of war continues with the duties that states have towards each other with regard to non-state actors on their territory, then moves on to ways of imputing state responsibility for the acts of non-state actors and ends with the legality of cross-border response operations against states.\nThus, a state's passivity or indifference to a non-state agent on its own territory could trigger its liability, possibly to the same extent, as if it had actively participated in the planning, an involvement that can be established by an analysis. post facto whether the state could have put more effort into preventing the cyber attack.\nBased on the above, it is clear that victim states can respond by force to armed attacks by non-state actors located in another state when host states violate their duty to prevent such attacks. If supplemented by cyber attacks, imputing state responsibility in this way gives states a legal way to use active defenses without the need to separately assign an attack to the state or its agents. In fact, imputation of liability is the equivalent of attributing the attack to the state or its agents.\nTherefore, in this case, it is essential to establish and explain why cyberattacks are armed attacks, which is the duty of a state to prevent cyberattacks, and the means and circumstances that would allow a victim state to respond by force to a cyber attack.\nMoreover, the attribution requirement perpetuates the \"response crisis\" because it is virtually impossible to attribute cyber attacks during the attack. Although states can track cyberattacks retroactively to the servers of computers in another state, conclusively establishing the identity of the attacker requires intensive investigation, which requires time and the help of the home state.\nGiven the ban on forcibly responding until an attack has been attributed to a state or its agents, coupled with the fact that the vast majority of cyber attacks are conducted by non-state actors, it should come as no surprise that states are reluctant to deal with cyber attacks as acts of war, thus risking violations of international law. This \"assignment issue\" blocks states in response.\n Carr, Jeffrey, op.cit., p. 67.\n It is a long-established principle of international law that a state is obliged to use diligence to prevent the commission of criminal acts against another nation or its people. Recognized in several international acts, the principle implies that a state cannot knowingly allow its territory to be used for actions contrary to the rights of other states. Of course, there is no absolute obligation on the host state to prevent all cyber attacks on its territory, but when a host state has the capacity to prevent an armed attack by non-state actors on its territory, it fails to do so. This violates its duty of prevention under international law.\n For details on these stages, see Carr, Jeffrey, op.cit., p. 53 et seq.\n For a graphic evolution, see Carr, Jeffrey, op.cit., p. 47.\nJournal of Law and Public Administration\nVolume VIII, Issue 15, 2022\nEarly detection and warning programs can help capture cyber attacks before they reach their climax, but even the best programs are not able to detect all cyber attacks.\nWhen an ongoing cyber attack has already caused a serious, immediate, invasive, direct, and measurable damage, it can be safely classified as an armed attack, even if it is still ongoing. On the other hand, when an attack did not cause such damage, the system administrator will have to consider: (1) a possible immediate future injury, (2) the likelihood of avoiding the attack with purely defensive measures, respectively (3) whether the attack should be classified as an imminent armed attack.\nAfter all, the state can avoid being the target of active defenses from another state, even when the attacks come from its territory, by taking concrete measures to prevent cyber attacks, such as the implementation of cyber attacks. Of the legal framework on crime, the application of these laws and cooperation with victim states to bring the attackers to justice. In this endeavor, the human element, with all its strengths and weaknesses, is paramount.\nStates that violate their duty to prevent cyber attacks and refuse to change their practices should be held accountable - at least indirectly - for all subsequent attacks that come from within their borders, in accordance with the law of war. At a time when cyber attacks are threatening global security and states are struggling to find ways to improve their cyber defenses, there is no reason to protect sanctuary states from the legal use of active defenses by victim states, and there is every reason to increase the state's defense against cyber attacks.\nIn other words, states not only enjoy rights, but must also fulfill certain obligations under international law, among which the idea of \"due diligence\" occupies a central place - a state is obliged to use diligence to prevent the commission within the limits its criminal acts against other nations. This duty of states is continuous, compared to the need to protect other states against harmful acts of individuals - state or non-state actors, individuals or legal entities - launched from within their own jurisdictions (called \"sanctuary states\").\nIn this new age of cyber warfare, the Web is both a battlefield and an information space. Social services such as Twitter, Facebook, MySpace or LiveJournal are an essential part of the hacker's toolkit. Commonly known as the Social Web, these services provide an unprecedented repository of personal data, personal information about people, companies and governments, which can be used for financial crime, espionage and misinformation, both by state hackers and by non-state actors.\n## IV. Cyber espionage – an adjacent weapon in cyber warfare?\nCyber warfare - sometimes called \"bloodless war\" - is closely linked to cybercrime, cyber security, cyber terrorism, cyber espionage, cyberspace, the differentiation between these concepts being sensitive because they are largely intertwined. The armies of the world are struggling to cope with a new field of cyber battle, by delimiting and framing their actions in the sphere of practical applicability of these concepts.\nIt is often impossible to determine whether attempts to hack a computer in another state were acts of cyber warfare or cyber intelligence gathering. Unlike cyber attack activity, the collection of information is not always based on cyber exploitation as a facilitator.\n Active defense is the most appropriate type of force to use against cyber attacks in light of jus in bello principles. First of all, in terms of military necessity, active defense is probably the full force needed to carry out the mission of defending against a cyber attack. Active defense can track down an attack at the source and immediately annihilate it, while kinetic weapons will be slower and less effective than the speed of a hack-back. Therefore, the use of kinetic weapons to the detriment of active defense will not only be less effective, but will also violate the principle of necessity by employing force only for the sake of destruction. In addition, the choice between active defense versus kinetic weapons should reduce the possibility of escalating these situations on a large scale in armed conflicts between states.\n Maurer, Tim (2018). Cyber mercenaries, The State, Hackers and Power, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, p. 130. The author refers to the jurisprudence of the International Court of Justice which stated that \"it is the obligation of each state not to knowingly allow the territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other states.\"\n For methods of collecting information in the virtual environment, see Oakley, Jacob G, op.cit., pp. 96 - 97. And for the relationship between cyber intelligence gathering, cyber reconnaissance and cyber attacks, broadly, op.cit., pp. 102-108.\nJournal of Law and Public Administration\nVolume VIII, Issue 15, 2022\nIn international law, cyberespionage has been defined as \"the practice of spying or using spies to obtain information about the plans and activities of a foreign government or a competing company\".\nAnother interesting thing about espionage is that it is not always sponsored or initiated by the enemy state. In fact, in many cases of espionage around the world, the person who collects information and transmits it to foreign powers has done so of his own free will, sometimes out of revenge and sometimes for reasons of financial compensation, or for other philosophical and ethical reasons.\nCyberespionage may seem similar, but it is different from a motivational point of view, with cyber manipulation activities. Manipulation, as a form of cyber attack, consists of controlling or modifying information, information systems and / or networks in cyberspace to create physical effects of denial, using deception, bait, conditioning, forgery, and other similar techniques. Use your opponent's information resources for the purpose of apparent friendship, to create clues that do not appear immediately in cyberspace. The targeted network may appear to be operating normally until side or tertiary effects occur, including proven physical effects of the attack.\n## V. Conclusions\nNo change in technology so far, however, seems to rival the potential for transformation as much as the development of offensive cyber capabilities. Indeed, this is demonstrated by the invention of a new label for the notion of war involving cyber attacks, namely \"cyber warfare\", as if it were not just a new type of weapon, but a whole new kind of war.\nIn the circumstances of the armed / classical war, the growing importance of both military and personal data or otherwise protected by law is obvious. In an age when individuals voluntarily understand how to transmit, store, and receive large amounts of personal data over the Internet, planting software in electronic devices to erase, modify, or approximate data is becoming a crucial new tactic of war: a \"fifth dimension battlefield\", as it is often said in doctrine, after air, sea, earth and outer space.\nThis change in staff has led to the merger of military and corporate espionage functions, and as a result, the militarization of cyberspace has created legal and moral ambiguity regarding privacy rights, as well as a personal responsibility to be targeted in cyberspace. virtue of the simple position it occupies in relation to an information network.\nThese tendencies contributed to the change in the structure of the war, with the result that the line distinction between the military and the civilian field blurred. Cyber warfare operations thus occupy a crucial position in the changing landscape of military conflict and require prompt response from the victim states, provided that the proportionality and correct identification of attackers and the international legal framework are respected.\nProportionality must be encouraged, for example, because it is a crucial issue in military ethics as well as in common criminal law. It requires that no more force be used than is necessary to repel an attack or to fulfill other legitimate objectives. But how do you determine what constitutes a necessary response to a cyber attack? More importantly, how should we determine if it is ever proportionate to launch an offensive cyber warfare counterattack? There are open-ended questions raised in the relevant literature, to which the practice is to be answered, being undoubtedly that the legitimate collective defense requires a more precise and responsible action against the dangers arising with the evolution of technology and its malicious use for which run counter to individual or collective safety.",

Specific and the Commitment of State Responsibility\nVasile COMAN\nTitu Maiorescu University, Romania\nFaculty of Law, Bucharest\nLaw Doctoral School\nPrahova Court, Romania\nCriminal section, Ploiești\nv.comann@yahoo.com\n# Abstract:\nDue to their worrying presence, cyber attacks pose new challenges to states, both nationally and between states, and are almost non-existent during recent military conflicts. Global peace requires at the legal and practical level a firm reaction against their use, but with the observance of rules and limits of the intensity of the force used, including the real need and proportionality.\nThe study seeks to establish some guidelines under the mentioned aspects, far from being widely accepted in current legal and political doctrines, and can be a starting point in developing a predictable legislative framework effective, effective in action and decisive in preserving the real sense of security individual and collective.\nKeywords: cyber attacks; war; armed conflict; responsibility; state.\n# I. Introduction\nThe presence of cybernetics in the modern life of states is a reality that can no longer be ignored, bringing undeniable benefits to people's well-being, but being accompanied by certain risks, the most important of which is the use of technological advantages for criminal or illicit purposes in general. The risk is real and it can already be seen empirically that in the case of recent armed conflicts (for example, the Russia-Ukraine conflict that began on February 24, 2022), the cyber component is not only used consistently, but is and targeted by attacks of the same nature by combatants.\nIt is important to note that, while the term \"cyber attack\" is often used in the literature, to date, all but a few effects of offensive cyber operations have remained below the level considered to be the use of force or armed attack, within the meaning of the provisions of the United Nations Charter. Moreover, malicious cyber activity can take place over an extended period of time - months, if not years - and is often not detected. For this reason, such activity is therefore better described as \"cyber operations\" than as \"attack.\"1.\nIn the military and international law, there are heated discussions about possible situations in which cyber attacks can be qualified as acts of war in themselves, especially when they take place during actual armed attacks. However, it is true that the increasing emergence of cyber attacks and the introduction of new technologies in the military and electronics industry have led to a fundamental change in the features that previously characterized acts of pure kinetic warfare, so it may seem necessary to adapt the law of war and international humanitarian law. which must evolve just as fast2.\nJournal of Law and Public Administration\nVolume VIII, Issue 15, 2022\n## II. Cyber Attacks. Specific and content\nIn order to keep the internet safe and peaceful, it is vital to establish the constitutive content of cyber attacks, the manner of manifestation and the targets primarily targeted, so that they can be recognized when they occur or, ideally, in time.\nIdentifying the real actors behind a cyber attack is a notoriously difficult task, which increases exponentially in the event of an armed conflict. Attributing attacks to individual actors (states or international organizations, or private actors) is traditionally seen as an acid test to determine whether an attack is assessed as an act of cyber warfare that complements kinetic warfare, or just an act. conjunctural of cyber terrorism (\"cyber hooliganism\").\nCyber attribution is the act of tying together cyber activities in such an aggression, based on their attributes, to determine if they come from the same actor, the most difficult part being determining the motivation of the latter. The logical attribution process consists of 4 steps: a) Discovering the indicators of compromise of the attacked systems - by administering evidence of unauthorized activity in a network or organization, b) Associating them together as belonging to specific actors based on their attributes, c) Precise identification of the actor, d) determination of the actor's motivation.\nThe assignment process can target a particular unit, organization, or even individual behind the cyber activity. The award process is particularly important in this situation, in which, without identity and motivation, it is not possible to know who the enemy is and, implicitly, how to be annihilated with an active or passive response, tactical or technical, from the victim state.\nUnlike weapons of mass destruction, cyber attacks are \"weapons of mass iritation\" and can cause a \"computer pandemic,\" and in the event of an armed conflict, they are non-physical in nature.\nCyber attacks are generally non-public and usually target government or private institutions, usually major financial institutions affecting public confidence in Internet-mediated transactions, severely disrupting their critical infrastructure and security architecture.\nAmong the most publicized in recent years are cyber attacks in the 2008 Russia-Georgia conflict, cyber attacks on Estonia in 2007 (the most important recent cyber war, which was led by a group of young pro-Kremlin), the military operation of Russia in Chechnya, which have shown that computer systems are an important component of future wars, so concrete legislative measures are needed to limit and eliminate attacks in this area.\nDuring an armed conflict, the cybernetic component unequivocally plays a key role, disrupting the electronic communication systems of combat units; it is a quasi-official part of the military war strategies developed by states.\nJens David; Govern, Kevin; Finkelstein, Claire (2015), Cyberwar. Law and Ethics for Virtual Conflicts, Oxford: Oxford University Press, United Kingdom, pp. 16-17.\n Oakley, Jacob G. (2019), Waging cyberwar. technical challenges and operational constraints, New York: Apress Publishing, USA, pp. 114.\n For details on the steps to be taken in cyber attack, see Oakley, Jacob G., op.cit., pp. 116-130.\n Moreover, the award decision must weigh operationally other concerns, political ramifications, strategic impacts and even moral dilemmas.\n Carr, Jeffrey (2012), Inside Cyber Warfare. Mapping the cyberunderworld, Sebastopol, California: O'Reilly Media Inc., p. 8.\n Covert cyber actions can be of two general types: (1) propaganda and misinformation that would be the subject of psychological operations to manipulate the evolution of the real armed conflict; and, (2) actions to shut down the computer networks of the target countries\n On the cyber side of the war in Georgia, coordinated by www.stopGeorgia.info (located in Germany) and www.stopGeorgia.ru (located in the USA), see, José Rios, Maria; Tenreiro de Magalhães, Sérgio; Santos, Leonel, The Georgia's cyberwar, available at www.researchgate.net. The attacks consisted mainly of SQL Injection and DDoS actions.\n The immediate cause of the cyber attacks on Estonia was the Estonian government's decision to move a war memorial of the Soviet Army from central Tallinn, the capital of Estonia. Many Estonians see the memorial as a harsh reminder of the former Soviet Union's \"occupation\" of Estonia, while many Russians see the statue as a memorial to the Red Army's sacrifices in liberating Estonia from Nazi Germany.\nJournal of Law and Public Administration\nVolume VIII, Issue 15, 2022\nThere are multi-national private hackers (nonstate hackers or patriotic hackers) secretly hired by states to move the real origin and responsibility for plausible deniability, while they enjoy the results of the attackers and support them. these by providing the necessary resources.\nThus, in times of armed conflict or political tension between states, some members of a state's citizens may be motivated to support the country's war or political effort by taking direct action on the cyber component of the enemy involved in the conflict. Hackers (\"patriotic hackers\") are private citizens qualified in cyber attack capabilities, who can initiate a cyber attack against another state on their own. They may do so without the consent, direction or control of the State to which they belong or in whose territory they are located. However, there have been incidents in which it is suspected that hacktivists were encouraged and aided by the state, being used as proxies (eg the 2007 cyber attack on Estonia, attributed by the West to Russia).\nRegardless of the origin of the perpetrator, cyber attacks in the context of an armed conflict can have the following objectives:\na) Exposing current realities (eg in 2008 in the context of the Israeli-led war against Palestine, Israeli hackers penetrated Palestinian TV and radio stations, inserting scenes with the death of Palestinian leaders).\nb) Implement malicious attack programs on unmanned military drones (eg Conficker C virus) frequently used in armed conflict, compared to the reality that military units understand the strategic and tactical need for unmanned aerial systems (UAS), making them an integral part of their arsenal of monitoring or even attacking the enemy.\nb) The paralysis of the targeted websites for certain periods of time and the blocking of the normal activity of some critical institutions of the state, with indirect consequences on the public services, including of some smaller businesses / firms; attackers can change the language used by the attacked sites or the IP address (eg in the 2008 Gaza war - the \"cast lead\" operation), or post messages against the war or with the dead violence.\nc) indirectly causing material damage to the institutions or legal or even natural persons concerned - even by restricting regular access to the Internet, by attacks on governmental (political) or commercial sites, or by silencing political opponents.\nFor example, in the 2009 elections in Iran, when the government decided to shut down the internet in the country in order to stop the massive protests of election fraud, carried out through Facebook and Twitter, in a context in which hackers from opposition parties would have launched DDoS attacks on government sites.\nd) collecting relevant data sought by penetrating networks, including by creating fictitious pages (phishing) or fictitious groups on social networks - communication (eg, Facebook, Telegram) to influence the mood of the population concerned.\nThe purpose is to shape and control public opinion about how events actually unfolded by DDoS, SQL Injection, or Crosssite scripting (XSS) attacks on government sites (Government, Banks, Parliament, Ministries, Lines). communication, embassy websites)\n We emphasize that international law presupposes that armed conflict is initiated only by states (as subjects of law) and not by groups or individuals.\n Demonstrating a link between non-state actors, hacktivists and the beneficiary government can be difficult, sometimes impossible or takes too long to confirm that the competent legal authority of the target state can take swift response.\n As we will see in the section on the attribution and imputability of cyber attacks, according to international law, if patriotic hackers carry out a cyber attack against another state that rises to the level of an \"armed attack\", the victim state has the legal right, acting inself-defense, to use force against those hackers.\n From missiles armed with missiles or bombs to so-called traditional ammunition drones (also known as kamikaze drones), this unmanned technology completes many new challenges and opens up a whole new set of possibilities for armed forces around the world.\n Politically motivated cyber attacks range in sophistication, from small-scale denial of simple attacks to well-organized and covert espionage attacks. The sophistication of a cyber attack depends on the skill of the attackers and the amount of reconnaissance performed before the attack. For considerations regarding cyber warfare capabilities in Australia, Brazil, Canada, North Korea, Estonia, Czech Republic, France, Germany, India, Iran, Israel, Italy, Kenya, NATO, China, Pakistan, etc. - see Carr, Jeffrey, op.cit., pp. 243 - 262. An example of a political attack is during the 2009 Nigerian elections to control election information.\nJournal of Law and Public Administration\nVolume VIII, Issue 15, 2022\ne) for recognizing and imposing a supremacy between cyber hackers, taking advantage of the context of kinetic conflict. For example, during the 2006-2008 Gaza war (eg Team Evil, Cold Zero, - formats for resistance to the Gaza war).\nThis notoriety can also occur through the acquisition of cyber attacks during major social crises or key moments in society (eg presidential elections, change of political regime). Among those known, Team Hell - a group of hackers with political or religious orientations, Agd_Scorp, Jurm Team, C-H Team, Gaza Hacker Team, DNS Team, DZ Team, etc. were mentioned in the literature.\nf) to transmit signals of the cyber capacity of a state, to other states in conflict or competition (eg in 2009, on the day of the USA were attacked several strategic sites, of some government institutions and of some private companies - which carries out contracts with the state on military projects, in this sense being suspected North Korea).\ng) the insertion of sophisticated viruses in the target computers, for the exploitation of resources or the search for classified information, and if the compromised computer system is part of a larger network, the attacker obtains access to the main network; it takes advantage of the fact that antivirus technology simply cannot keep pace with known threats, much less those they are unaware of.\nIn the case of armed (kinetic) conflicts, the targets of interest (cyber bullets) include hubs and other crucial links in the system that move enemy troops involved in the war, such as ports, airports, means of transport, battlefield facilities and communications. Targets could include computer systems located in the enemy state or abroad, command and control nodes, spatial information, surveillance, and means of recognition and communication, command, control and information systems.\nOne such example is cyber attacks on tanks used in a pending military operation, in which a state may have a cyber weapon capable of harming its enemy's tanks. Tanks are equipped with computerized weapon systems in today's armies and could be susceptible to cyber attacks. A single cyber weapon may be able to stop the controls of the electric motor or the tank, virtually eliminating it from combat. Another cyber weapon can attack the warhead reinforcement system or the targeting system for the same purpose. Both effects are considered cyber attacks.\nPredictably, cyber attacks will target telecommunications infrastructure (e.g., a virus designed to shut off power to military installations), transportation infrastructure, secure networks, the economy, energy (generating blackouts), security breaches, and disabling security breaches. programs to protect the targeted systems, sometimes leaving graffiti behind in the attacked sites (containing information about certain exposed individuals) or on the main page, the online banking payment systems.\nAs a way of action, hack tek strategies are developed by organized crime in cyber underground labs and usually start by attacking individual servers or computers by infecting with Trojan viruses, such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) and SQL Injection.\nThe more advanced the technology, the more attacks appeared in forms not previously covered by official statements and state practices.\nCyber attacks come in many different forms, their destructive potential being limited only by the creativity and skill of the attackers behind them, and usually a kinetic attack is combined with a support cyber attack. Although it may seem intuitive that cyberattacks may constitute armed attacks, especially in light of their indirect ability to injure or kill, the legal\n For details on the profile of these groups of hackers and their guidelines, see Carr, Jeffrey, op.cit., pp. 22-27.\n Often, the selection of the target is given two main considerations: the value of the information that will be obtained and the difficulty of success in operation (to exclude the probability of detection).\n The same goes for intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). ICBM launchers are developed within the limits of state secrecy and can essentially hit anywhere in the world in the execution of an attack. Although countermeasures capable of intercepting ICBMs have been developed, some states, such as Russia and North Korea, have recently announced that they have developed models that cannot be intercepted at this time (eg Sarmat / Satan 2, in the case of Russia).\n DDoS attacks typically disrupt communications and computing capabilities by sending huge amounts of (sometimes malformed) traffic to devices to alter or deny their ability to function as originally intended. They are common on the Internet because they are relatively unsophisticated and can be targeted from an Internet presence point in the cyberspace of one state against one in another enemy state.\nJournal of Law and Public Administration\nVolume VIII, Issue 15, 2022\ncommunity has been reluctant to take this approach, as cyberattacks do not resemble traditional armed attacks with conventional weapons, having another specific manifestation.\nThe exploitation of computer systems in cyber warfare is, in fact, an exploitation of the human errors of those who thought and built them into their elements - ways of exploiting, reconfiguring or overwriting computer programs (eg, a virtual gateway which uses facial recognition is altered, nullifying the image component, or a cyber attack that corrupts the hard disks of the surveillance cameras where their recordings are stored, or the steering systems of some devices engaged in kinetic warfare).\n## III. Establishing the responsibility of the state for cyber attacks carried out on its territory\nStates may not respond to a cross-border cyber attack by force without first establishing the State's responsibility for the attack. Although historically this has meant that an attack has taken place, to be attributed to a state or its agents, direct control of an attack is no longer a requirement of state responsibility. Today, international law is based on the responsibility of a state and only on the breach of its international obligations to prevent and combat it.\nThis change is particularly important for cyber attacks, as the prevailing view is that cross-border cyber attacks should be treated as a criminal matter rather than a national security issue, and this seems to be based on the historical view of state responsibility. This limited view of state responsibility blocks attacked states in the response crisis by requiring states to attribute cyber attacks to a state or its agents before responding through active defenses, even if the likelihood of successfully assigning a ranged attack is generally uncertain. Consequently, states in crisis in response to a cyber attack act under the false assumption that they must decide between effective but illegal active defenses and the less effective but legal path of passive defenses and the scope of domestic criminal law.\nGiven the perspective of state responsibility, states should first determine whether the cyber attack can be blamed on the home state. Once a cyber attack is blamed on a state and that state refuses to comply with its international obligations, the legal barriers to self-defense action disappear.\nWith regard to cyber attacks, the accepted principles of common *jus ad bellum* still support the imputation of state responsibility for armed attacks by non-state actors when the attacks come from a state that allows non-state actors to carry out criminal operations within their borders. States that allow non-state actors to carry out these operations are in breach of their duty to prevent attacks on other states and are known as \"sanctuary states\". This is extremely important for cyber-attack states because when a cyber-attack comes from a sanctuary state, a victim-state can use active defenses and avoid crisis response.\nTherefore, we need to understand the answers to two key questions:\n- What does a state's duty to prevent cyber attacks mean?\nThis obligation in fact includes several smaller tasks to prevent cyber attacks, including the adoption of strict criminal laws, the vigorous enforcement of investigative procedures, the prosecution of attackers and, during the investigation and prosecution, cooperation with cyber-attack states. These are the duties of all states and are binding as customary international law. The authority for these duties comes from all three sources of international tradition in the field of law - international conventions, international customs and general principles of law common to civilized nations, as evidenced by the judgments and teachings of the most qualified international lawyers.\nThe only international treaty analogous to cybernetics is the European Convention on Cybercrime in 2001. Although the treaty is only a regional agreement, it is still very influential on customary international law because of the importance of the states that have ratified it, originating from the doctrine of the states particularly affected.\n---\nUnlike conventional warfare, an autonomous and exclusive act of warfare in the cyber realm is difficult to conceive.\nAvailable at www.eur-lex.europa.eu.The Cybercrime Convention requires its parties to establish \"criminal\" offences for almost every conceivable type of cyber attack, in accordance with their domestic law.\nJournal of Law and Public Administration\nVolume VIII, Issue 15, 2022\nIn addition, it demonstrates the recognition by states of both the need to criminalize cyber attacks and the obligation of states to prevent their territory from being used by non-state actors to conduct cyber attacks against other states. The convention is also significant because it recognizes that cyber attacks cannot be banned during an attack, and the only way to prevent them is through aggressive law enforcement, coupled with state cooperation.\nInternational Terrorist Terrorism Treaties provide additional, albeit indirect, support for the duty to prevent cyber attacks. The international community recognizes terrorism as a threat to international peace and security, but no agreement has been reached on a definition. As a result, states have increasingly taken the approach of outlawing certain acts of terrorism - terrorists are constantly developing new methods of attack, rather than outlawing terrorism itself.\nThese treaties impose on states several common requirements regarding terrorist attacks, such as taking all practicable measures to prevent such attacks, criminalizing attacks, referring cases to the competent authorities for prosecution, and obliging states to cooperate with each other during criminal proceedings[21]. Although these treaties do not address cyber attacks, the principles contained therein contribute to influencing state requirements under customary international law on terrorism. As there is growing evidence that cyberattacks will soon be an active weapon for terrorists, states should refer to the common principles found in these treaties as opinio juris when cyberattacks are used as a terrorist weapon.\n- What must a state do to avoid violating its duty to prevent?\nThe treatment of cyber attacks in accordance with their criminal law also proves the recognition of the duty of states to prevent cyber attacks. Many states criminalize such acts and prosecute cyber attacks to discourage attackers from committing law enforcement, which seems to be the only way to protect and prevent damage to their computer systems.\nThis gives credibility to the notion that, unlike a conventional attack, which can be stopped after detection, cyber attacks can only be stopped by setting ex ante barriers that attackers are trying to cross. Moreover, these practices demonstrate a growing acceptance among states that cyber attacks must be stopped and that the way to do this is to enforce the law[22].\nStates' responses to transnational terrorist attacks further support the recognition of a duty to prevent cyber attacks under customary international law. This involves the difficult task of analyzing data and clues about the existence and extent of such attacks[23].\nThe more cyber attacks resemble terrorism, the easier it will be to fit into the paradigm built to deal with transnational terrorism. However, regardless of their purpose, cyber attacks pose a threat to international peace and security and should be treated as a category of other recognized transnational threats.\nThe general principles of law common to civilized nations also support the recognition of the duty to prevent cyber attacks. It is a well-established principle in the domestic law of most states that individuals should be held liable for acts or omissions that have a causal link to the harm suffered by another person. While international law is not bound by the domestic laws of states, international law can be derived from the general principles common to the great legal systems of the world. Most states use causality as a principle for establishing individual responsibility, giving credibility to the idea that the responsibility of a state should also be based on causation[24].\nCyber attacks are extremely difficult for states to detect before committing a particular attack, and are often committed by individuals or groups who are not even on a state's radar. However, just because cyberattacks are difficult\n21Cyberspace, as a global electronic medium, cannot be dominated or controlled by a single nation.\n22Carr, Jeffrey, op. cit., p. 64.\n23For details on this issue and the analysis techniques that could be used, see Petersson, Gustav Jakob; Breul, Jonathan D. (2017), Cyber Society, Big Data, andxs Evaluation, Comparative Policy Evaluation, Volume 24 (colective papers), USA, pp. 47-75.\n24States's responsibility for negligence in taking all reasonable measures to prevent crime and to prosecute, prosecute and bring to justice transnational cybercriminals has also been recognized in international justice, such as the International Court of Justice. See, in this regard, Carr, Jeffrey, op.cit., p. 67.\nJournal of Law and Public Administration\nVolume VIII, Issue 15, 2022\nto prevent does not mean that states can breach their duty to prevent them, and by enforcing the law vigorously, they will deter cyberattacks. States that do not enact such laws do not fulfill their duty to prevent cyberattacks.\nA state's passivity and indifference to cyber attacks make it a sanctuary state, from which attackers can operate safely. When viewed in this light, it becomes clear that a state can be held indirectly responsible for cyber attacks in accordance with the established principles of customary international law.\nHost states will be judged on their efforts to catch and prosecute cyber-attackers, which is likely to be the main way in which states can deter and prevent future attacks. When victim states end up judging whether a host state has complied with its international obligations, the host states must cooperate with the former to ensure their transparency and good faith.\nOnce a host state proves that it is a sanctuary state by its inaction, the other states can blame it for cyber attacks originating in its territory. At that point, the host state becomes responsible for the cyber attack that triggered the initial investigation, as well as for all future cyber attacks that come from its borders. This opens the door for a victim state to use active defenses against the servers of the computers involved during a cyber attack.\nWhen attacks are carried out, most often by non-state actors, across state borders, attracting international responsibility (usually indirect), in this case, begins with an analysis of whether the armed attacks of non-state actors fall under the law of war continues with the duties that states have towards each other with regard to non-state actors on their territory, then moves on to ways of imputing state responsibility for the acts of non-state actors and ends with the legality of cross-border response operations against states.\nThus, a state's passivity or indifference to a non-state agent on its own territory could trigger its liability, possibly to the same extent, as if it had actively participated in the planning, an involvement that can be established by an analysis. post facto whether the state could have put more effort into preventing the cyber attack.\nBased on the above, it is clear that victim states can respond by force to armed attacks by non-state actors located in another state when host states violate their duty to prevent such attacks. If supplemented by cyber attacks, imputing state responsibility in this way gives states a legal way to use active defenses without the need to separately assign an attack to the state or its agents. In fact, imputation of liability is the equivalent of attributing the attack to the state or its agents.\nTherefore, in this case, it is essential to establish and explain why cyberattacks are armed attacks, which is the duty of a state to prevent cyberattacks, and the means and circumstances that would allow a victim state to respond by force to a cyber attack.\nMoreover, the attribution requirement perpetuates the \"response crisis\" because it is virtually impossible to attribute cyber attacks during the attack. Although states can track cyberattacks retroactively to the servers of computers in another state, conclusively establishing the identity of the attacker requires intensive investigation, which requires time and the help of the home state.\nGiven the ban on forcibly responding until an attack has been attributed to a state or its agents, coupled with the fact that the vast majority of cyber attacks are conducted by non-state actors, it should come as no surprise that states are reluctant to deal with cyber attacks as acts of war, thus risking violations of international law. This \"assignment issue\" blocks states in response.\n Carr, Jeffrey, op.cit., p. 67.\n It is a long-established principle of international law that a state is obliged to use diligence to prevent the commission of criminal acts against another nation or its people. Recognized in several international acts, the principle implies that a state cannot knowingly allow its territory to be used for actions contrary to the rights of other states. Of course, there is no absolute obligation on the host state to prevent all cyber attacks on its territory, but when a host state has the capacity to prevent an armed attack by non-state actors on its territory, it fails to do so. This violates its duty of prevention under international law.\n For details on these stages, see Carr, Jeffrey, op.cit., p. 53 et seq.\n For a graphic evolution, see Carr, Jeffrey, op.cit., p. 47.\nJournal of Law and Public Administration\nVolume VIII, Issue 15, 2022\nEarly detection and warning programs can help capture cyber attacks before they reach their climax, but even the best programs are not able to detect all cyber attacks.\nWhen an ongoing cyber attack has already caused a serious, immediate, invasive, direct, and measurable damage, it can be safely classified as an armed attack, even if it is still ongoing. On the other hand, when an attack did not cause such damage, the system administrator will have to consider: (1) a possible immediate future injury, (2) the likelihood of avoiding the attack with purely defensive measures, respectively (3) whether the attack should be classified as an imminent armed attack.\nAfter all, the state can avoid being the target of active defenses from another state, even when the attacks come from its territory, by taking concrete measures to prevent cyber attacks, such as the implementation of cyber attacks. Of the legal framework on crime, the application of these laws and cooperation with victim states to bring the attackers to justice. In this endeavor, the human element, with all its strengths and weaknesses, is paramount.\nStates that violate their duty to prevent cyber attacks and refuse to change their practices should be held accountable - at least indirectly - for all subsequent attacks that come from within their borders, in accordance with the law of war. At a time when cyber attacks are threatening global security and states are struggling to find ways to improve their cyber defenses, there is no reason to protect sanctuary states from the legal use of active defenses by victim states, and there is every reason to increase the state's defense against cyber attacks.\nIn other words, states not only enjoy rights, but must also fulfill certain obligations under international law, among which the idea of \"due diligence\" occupies a central place - a state is obliged to use diligence to prevent the commission within the limits its criminal acts against other nations. This duty of states is continuous, compared to the need to protect other states against harmful acts of individuals - state or non-state actors, individuals or legal entities - launched from within their own jurisdictions (called \"sanctuary states\").\nIn this new age of cyber warfare, the Web is both a battlefield and an information space. Social services such as Twitter, Facebook, MySpace or LiveJournal are an essential part of the hacker's toolkit. Commonly known as the Social Web, these services provide an unprecedented repository of personal data, personal information about people, companies and governments, which can be used for financial crime, espionage and misinformation, both by state hackers and by non-state actors.\n## IV. Cyber espionage – an adjacent weapon in cyber warfare?\nCyber warfare - sometimes called \"bloodless war\" - is closely linked to cybercrime, cyber security, cyber terrorism, cyber espionage, cyberspace, the differentiation between these concepts being sensitive because they are largely intertwined. The armies of the world are struggling to cope with a new field of cyber battle, by delimiting and framing their actions in the sphere of practical applicability of these concepts.\nIt is often impossible to determine whether attempts to hack a computer in another state were acts of cyber warfare or cyber intelligence gathering. Unlike cyber attack activity, the collection of information is not always based on cyber exploitation as a facilitator.\n Active defense is the most appropriate type of force to use against cyber attacks in light of jus in bello principles. First of all, in terms of military necessity, active defense is probably the full force needed to carry out the mission of defending against a cyber attack. Active defense can track down an attack at the source and immediately annihilate it, while kinetic weapons will be slower and less effective than the speed of a hack-back. Therefore, the use of kinetic weapons to the detriment of active defense will not only be less effective, but will also violate the principle of necessity by employing force only for the sake of destruction. In addition, the choice between active defense versus kinetic weapons should reduce the possibility of escalating these situations on a large scale in armed conflicts between states.\n Maurer, Tim (2018). Cyber mercenaries, The State, Hackers and Power, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, p. 130. The author refers to the jurisprudence of the International Court of Justice which stated that \"it is the obligation of each state not to knowingly allow the territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other states.\"\n For methods of collecting information in the virtual environment, see Oakley, Jacob G, op.cit., pp. 96 - 97. And for the relationship between cyber intelligence gathering, cyber reconnaissance and cyber attacks, broadly, op.cit., pp. 102-108.\nJournal of Law and Public Administration\nVolume VIII, Issue 15, 2022\nIn international law, cyberespionage has been defined as \"the practice of spying or using spies to obtain information about the plans and activities of a foreign government or a competing company\".\nAnother interesting thing about espionage is that it is not always sponsored or initiated by the enemy state. In fact, in many cases of espionage around the world, the person who collects information and transmits it to foreign powers has done so of his own free will, sometimes out of revenge and sometimes for reasons of financial compensation, or for other philosophical and ethical reasons.\nCyberespionage may seem similar, but it is different from a motivational point of view, with cyber manipulation activities. Manipulation, as a form of cyber attack, consists of controlling or modifying information, information systems and / or networks in cyberspace to create physical effects of denial, using deception, bait, conditioning, forgery, and other similar techniques. Use your opponent's information resources for the purpose of apparent friendship, to create clues that do not appear immediately in cyberspace. The targeted network may appear to be operating normally until side or tertiary effects occur, including proven physical effects of the attack.\n## V. Conclusions\nNo change in technology so far, however, seems to rival the potential for transformation as much as the development of offensive cyber capabilities. Indeed, this is demonstrated by the invention of a new label for the notion of war involving cyber attacks, namely \"cyber warfare\", as if it were not just a new type of weapon, but a whole new kind of war.\nIn the circumstances of the armed / classical war, the growing importance of both military and personal data or otherwise protected by law is obvious. In an age when individuals voluntarily understand how to transmit, store, and receive large amounts of personal data over the Internet, planting software in electronic devices to erase, modify, or approximate data is becoming a crucial new tactic of war: a \"fifth dimension battlefield\", as it is often said in doctrine, after air, sea, earth and outer space.\nThis change in staff has led to the merger of military and corporate espionage functions, and as a result, the militarization of cyberspace has created legal and moral ambiguity regarding privacy rights, as well as a personal responsibility to be targeted in cyberspace. virtue of the simple position it occupies in relation to an information network.\nThese tendencies contributed to the change in the structure of the war, with the result that the line distinction between the military and the civilian field blurred. Cyber warfare operations thus occupy a crucial position in the changing landscape of military conflict and require prompt response from the victim states, provided that the proportionality and correct identification of attackers and the international legal framework are respected.\nProportionality must be encouraged, for example, because it is a crucial issue in military ethics as well as in common criminal law. It requires that no more force be used than is necessary to repel an attack or to fulfill other legitimate objectives. But how do you determine what constitutes a necessary response to a cyber attack? More importantly, how should we determine if it is ever proportionate to launch an offensive cyber warfare counterattack? There are open-ended questions raised in the relevant literature, to which the practice is to be answered, being undoubtedly that the legitimate collective defense requires a more precise and responsible action against the dangers arising with the evolution of technology and its malicious use for which run counter to individual or collective safety."

Specific and the Commitment of State Responsibility\nVasile COMAN\nTitu Maiorescu University, Romania\nFaculty of Law, Bucharest\nLaw Doctoral School\nPrahova Court, Romania\nCriminal section, Ploiești\nv.comann@yahoo.com\n# Abstract:\nDue to their worrying presence, cyber attacks pose new challenges to states, both nationally and between states, and are almost non-existent during recent military conflicts. Global peace requires at the legal and practical level a firm reaction against their use, but with the observance of rules and limits of the intensity of the force used, including the real need and proportionality.\nThe study seeks to establish some guidelines under the mentioned aspects, far from being widely accepted in current legal and political doctrines, and can be a starting point in developing a predictable legislative framework effective, effective in action and decisive in preserving the real sense of security individual and collective.\nKeywords: cyber attacks; war; armed conflict; responsibility; state.\n# I. Introduction\nThe presence of cybernetics in the modern life of states is a reality that can no longer be ignored, bringing undeniable benefits to people's well-being, but being accompanied by certain risks, the most important of which is the use of technological advantages for criminal or illicit purposes in general. The risk is real and it can already be seen empirically that in the case of recent armed conflicts (for example, the Russia-Ukraine conflict that began on February 24, 2022), the cyber component is not only used consistently, but is and targeted by attacks of the same nature by combatants.\nIt is important to note that, while the term \"cyber attack\" is often used in the literature, to date, all but a few effects of offensive cyber operations have remained below the level considered to be the use of force or armed attack, within the meaning of the provisions of the United Nations Charter. Moreover, malicious cyber activity can take place over an extended period of time - months, if not years - and is often not detected. For this reason, such activity is therefore better described as \"cyber operations\" than as \"attack.\"1.\nIn the military and international law, there are heated discussions about possible situations in which cyber attacks can be qualified as acts of war in themselves, especially when they take place during actual armed attacks. However, it is true that the increasing emergence of cyber attacks and the introduction of new technologies in the military and electronics industry have led to a fundamental change in the features that previously characterized acts of pure kinetic warfare, so it may seem necessary to adapt the law of war and international humanitarian law. which must evolve just as fast2.\nJournal of Law and Public Administration\nVolume VIII, Issue 15, 2022\n## II. Cyber Attacks. Specific and content\nIn order to keep the internet safe and peaceful, it is vital to establish the constitutive content of cyber attacks, the manner of manifestation and the targets primarily targeted, so that they can be recognized when they occur or, ideally, in time.\nIdentifying the real actors behind a cyber attack is a notoriously difficult task, which increases exponentially in the event of an armed conflict. Attributing attacks to individual actors (states or international organizations, or private actors) is traditionally seen as an acid test to determine whether an attack is assessed as an act of cyber warfare that complements kinetic warfare, or just an act. conjunctural of cyber terrorism (\"cyber hooliganism\").\nCyber attribution is the act of tying together cyber activities in such an aggression, based on their attributes, to determine if they come from the same actor, the most difficult part being determining the motivation of the latter³. The logical attribution process consists of 4 steps: a) Discovering the indicators of compromise of the attacked systems - by administering evidence of unauthorized activity in a network or organization, b) Associating them together as belonging to specific actors based on their attributes, c) Precise identification of the actor, d) determination of the actor's motivation⁴.\nThe assignment process can target a particular unit, organization, or even individual behind the cyber activity. The award process is particularly important in this situation, in which, without identity and motivation, it is not possible to know who the enemy is and, implicitly, how to be annihilated with an active or passive response, tactical or technical, from the victim state⁵.\nUnlike weapons of mass destruction, cyber attacks are \"weapons of mass iritation\"⁶ and can cause a \"computer pandemic,\" and in the event of an armed conflict, they are non-physical in nature.\nCyber attacks are generally non-public and usually target government or private institutions, usually major financial institutions affecting public confidence in Internet-mediated transactions, severely disrupting their critical infrastructure and security architecture⁷.\nAmong the most publicized in recent years are cyber attacks in the 2008 Russia-Georgia conflict⁸, cyber attacks on Estonia in 2007 (the most important recent cyber war, which was led by a group of young pro-Kremlin⁹), the military operation of Russia in Chechnya, which have shown that computer systems are an important component of future wars, so concrete legislative measures are needed to limit and eliminate attacks in this area.\nDuring an armed conflict, the cybernetic component unequivocally plays a key role, disrupting the electronic communication systems of combat units; it is a quasi-official part of the military war strategies developed by states.\nJens David; Govern, Kevin; Finkelstein, Claire (2015), Cyberwar. Law and Ethics for Virtual Conflicts, Oxford: Oxford University Press, United Kingdom, pp. 16-17.\n³ Oakley, Jacob G. (2019), Waging cyberwar. technical challenges and operational constraints, New York: Apress Publishing, USA, pp. 114.\n⁴ For details on the steps to be taken in cyber attack, see Oakley, Jacob G., op.cit., pp. 116-130.\n⁵ Moreover, the award decision must weigh operationally other concerns, political ramifications, strategic impacts and even moral dilemmas.\n⁶ Carr, Jeffrey (2012), Inside Cyber Warfare. Mapping the cyberunderworld, Sebastopol, California: O'Reilly Media Inc., p. 8.\n⁷ Covert cyber actions can be of two general types: (1) propaganda and misinformation that would be the subject of psychological operations to manipulate the evolution of the real armed conflict; and, (2) actions to shut down the computer networks of the target countries\n⁸ On the cyber side of the war in Georgia, coordinated by www.stopGeorgia.info (located in Germany) and www.stopGeorgia.ru (located in the USA), see, José Rios, Maria; Tenreiro de Magalhães, Sérgio; Santos, Leonel, The Georgia's cyberwar, available at www.researchgate.net. The attacks consisted mainly of SQL Injection and DDoS actions.\n⁹ The immediate cause of the cyber attacks on Estonia was the Estonian government's decision to move a war memorial of the Soviet Army from central Tallinn, the capital of Estonia. Many Estonians see the memorial as a harsh reminder of the former Soviet Union's \"occupation\" of Estonia, while many Russians see the statue as a memorial to the Red Army's sacrifices in liberating Estonia from Nazi Germany.\nJournal of Law and Public Administration\nVolume VIII, Issue 15, 2022\nThere are multi-national private hackers (nonstate hackers or patriotic hackers) secretly hired by states to move the real origin and responsibility for plausible deniability, while they enjoy the results of the attackers and support them. these by providing the necessary resources¹⁰.\nThus, in times of armed conflict or political tension between states, some members of a state's citizens may be motivated to support the country's war or political effort by taking direct action on the cyber component of the enemy involved in the conflict. Hackers (\"patriotic hackers\") are private citizens qualified in cyber attack capabilities, who can initiate a cyber attack against another state on their own. They may do so without the consent, direction or control of the State to which they belong or in whose territory they are located¹¹. However, there have been incidents in which it is suspected that hacktivists were encouraged and aided by the state, being used as proxies (eg the 2007 cyber attack on Estonia, attributed by the West to Russia)¹².\nRegardless of the origin of the perpetrator, cyber attacks in the context of an armed conflict can have the following objectives:\na) Exposing current realities (eg in 2008 in the context of the Israeli-led war against Palestine, Israeli hackers penetrated Palestinian TV and radio stations, inserting scenes with the death of Palestinian leaders).\nb) Implement malicious attack programs on unmanned military drones (eg Conficker C virus) frequently used in armed conflict, compared to the reality that military units understand the strategic and tactical need for unmanned aerial systems (UAS), making them an integral part of their arsenal of monitoring or even attacking the enemy¹³.\nb) The paralysis of the targeted websites for certain periods of time and the blocking of the normal activity of some critical institutions of the state, with indirect consequences on the public services, including of some smaller businesses / firms; attackers can change the language used by the attacked sites or the IP address (eg in the 2008 Gaza war - the \"cast lead\" operation), or post messages against the war or with the dead violence.\nc) indirectly causing material damage to the institutions or legal or even natural persons concerned - even by restricting regular access to the Internet, by attacks on governmental (political¹⁴) or commercial sites, or by silencing political opponents.\nFor example, in the 2009 elections in Iran, when the government decided to shut down the internet in the country in order to stop the massive protests of election fraud, carried out through Facebook and Twitter, in a context in which hackers from opposition parties would have launched DDoS attacks on government sites.\nd) collecting relevant data sought by penetrating networks, including by creating fictitious pages (phishing) or fictitious groups on social networks - communication (eg, Facebook, Telegram) to influence the mood of the population concerned.\nThe purpose is to shape and control public opinion about how events actually unfolded by DDoS, SQL Injection, or Crosssite scripting (XSS) attacks on government sites (Government, Banks, Parliament, Ministries, Lines). communication, embassy websites)\n¹⁰ We emphasize that international law presupposes that armed conflict is initiated only by states (as subjects of law) and not by groups or individuals.\n¹¹ Demonstrating a link between non-state actors, hacktivists and the beneficiary government can be difficult, sometimes impossible or takes too long to confirm that the competent legal authority of the target state can take swift response.\n¹² As we will see in the section on the attribution and imputability of cyber attacks, according to international law, if patriotic hackers carry out a cyber attack against another state that rises to the level of an \"armed attack\", the victim state has the legal right, acting inself-defense, to use force against those hackers.\n¹³ From missiles armed with missiles or bombs to so-called traditional ammunition drones (also known as kamikaze drones), this unmanned technology completes many new challenges and opens up a whole new set of possibilities for armed forces around the world.\n¹⁴ Politically motivated cyber attacks range in sophistication, from small-scale denial of simple attacks to well-organized and covert espionage attacks. The sophistication of a cyber attack depends on the skill of the attackers and the amount of reconnaissance performed before the attack. For considerations regarding cyber warfare capabilities in Australia, Brazil, Canada, North Korea, Estonia, Czech Republic, France, Germany, India, Iran, Israel, Italy, Kenya, NATO, China, Pakistan, etc. - see Carr, Jeffrey, op.cit., pp. 243 - 262. An example of a political attack is during the 2009 Nigerian elections to control election information.\nJournal of Law and Public Administration\nVolume VIII, Issue 15, 2022\ne) for recognizing and imposing a supremacy between cyber hackers, taking advantage of the context of kinetic conflict. For example, during the 2006-2008 Gaza war (eg Team Evil, Cold Zero, - formats for resistance to the Gaza war).\nThis notoriety can also occur through the acquisition of cyber attacks during major social crises or key moments in society (eg presidential elections, change of political regime). Among those known, Team Hell - a group of hackers with political or religious orientations, Agd_Scorp, Jurm Team, C-H Team, Gaza Hacker Team, DNS Team, DZ Team, etc. were mentioned in the literature¹⁵.\nf) to transmit signals of the cyber capacity of a state, to other states in conflict or competition (eg in 2009, on the day of the USA were attacked several strategic sites, of some government institutions and of some private companies - which carries out contracts with the state on military projects, in this sense being suspected North Korea).\ng) the insertion of sophisticated viruses in the target computers, for the exploitation of resources or the search for classified information, and if the compromised computer system is part of a larger network, the attacker obtains access to the main network; it takes advantage of the fact that antivirus technology simply cannot keep pace with known threats, much less those they are unaware of¹⁶.\nIn the case of armed (kinetic) conflicts, the targets of interest (cyber bullets) include hubs and other crucial links in the system that move enemy troops involved in the war, such as ports, airports, means of transport, battlefield facilities and communications. Targets could include computer systems located in the enemy state or abroad, command and control nodes, spatial information, surveillance, and means of recognition and communication, command, control and information systems.\nOne such example is cyber attacks on tanks used in a pending military operation, in which a state may have a cyber weapon capable of harming its enemy's tanks. Tanks are equipped with computerized weapon systems in today's armies and could be susceptible to cyber attacks¹⁷. A single cyber weapon may be able to stop the controls of the electric motor or the tank, virtually eliminating it from combat. Another cyber weapon can attack the warhead reinforcement system or the targeting system for the same purpose. Both effects are considered cyber attacks.\nPredictably, cyber attacks will target telecommunications infrastructure (e.g., a virus designed to shut off power to military installations), transportation infrastructure, secure networks, the economy, energy (generating blackouts), security breaches, and disabling security breaches. programs to protect the targeted systems, sometimes leaving graffiti behind in the attacked sites (containing information about certain exposed individuals) or on the main page, the online banking payment systems.\nAs a way of action, hack tek strategies are developed by organized crime in cyber underground labs and usually start by attacking individual servers or computers by infecting with Trojan viruses, such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)¹⁸ and SQL Injection.\nThe more advanced the technology, the more attacks appeared in forms not previously covered by official statements and state practices.\nCyber attacks come in many different forms, their destructive potential being limited only by the creativity and skill of the attackers behind them, and usually a kinetic attack is combined with a support cyber attack. Although it may seem intuitive that cyberattacks may constitute armed attacks, especially in light of their indirect ability to injure or kill, the legal\n¹⁵ For details on the profile of these groups of hackers and their guidelines, see Carr, Jeffrey, op.cit., pp. 22-27.\n¹⁶ Often, the selection of the target is given two main considerations: the value of the information that will be obtained and the difficulty of success in operation (to exclude the probability of detection).\n¹⁷ The same goes for intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). ICBM launchers are developed within the limits of state secrecy and can essentially hit anywhere in the world in the execution of an attack. Although countermeasures capable of intercepting ICBMs have been developed, some states, such as Russia and North Korea, have recently announced that they have developed models that cannot be intercepted at this time (eg Sarmat / Satan 2, in the case of Russia).\n¹⁸ DDoS attacks typically disrupt communications and computing capabilities by sending huge amounts of (sometimes malformed) traffic to devices to alter or deny their ability to function as originally intended. They are common on the Internet because they are relatively unsophisticated and can be targeted from an Internet presence point in the cyberspace of one state against one in another enemy state.\nJournal of Law and Public Administration\nVolume VIII, Issue 15, 2022\ncommunity has been reluctant to take this approach, as cyberattacks do not resemble traditional armed attacks with conventional weapons, having another specific manifestation¹⁹.\nThe exploitation of computer systems in cyber warfare is, in fact, an exploitation of the human errors of those who thought and built them into their elements - ways of exploiting, reconfiguring or overwriting computer programs (eg, a virtual gateway which uses facial recognition is altered, nullifying the image component, or a cyber attack that corrupts the hard disks of the surveillance cameras where their recordings are stored, or the steering systems of some devices engaged in kinetic warfare).\n## III. Establishing the responsibility of the state for cyber attacks carried out on its territory\nStates may not respond to a cross-border cyber attack by force without first establishing the State's responsibility for the attack. Although historically this has meant that an attack has taken place, to be attributed to a state or its agents, direct control of an attack is no longer a requirement of state responsibility. Today, international law is based on the responsibility of a state and only on the breach of its international obligations to prevent and combat it.\nThis change is particularly important for cyber attacks, as the prevailing view is that cross-border cyber attacks should be treated as a criminal matter rather than a national security issue, and this seems to be based on the historical view of state responsibility. This limited view of state responsibility blocks attacked states in the response crisis by requiring states to attribute cyber attacks to a state or its agents before responding through active defenses, even if the likelihood of successfully assigning a ranged attack is generally uncertain. Consequently, states in crisis in response to a cyber attack act under the false assumption that they must decide between effective but illegal active defenses and the less effective but legal path of passive defenses and the scope of domestic criminal law.\nGiven the perspective of state responsibility, states should first determine whether the cyber attack can be blamed on the home state. Once a cyber attack is blamed on a state and that state refuses to comply with its international obligations, the legal barriers to self-defense action disappear.\nWith regard to cyber attacks, the accepted principles of common *jus ad bellum* still support the imputation of state responsibility for armed attacks by non-state actors when the attacks come from a state that allows non-state actors to carry out criminal operations within their borders. States that allow non-state actors to carry out these operations are in breach of their duty to prevent attacks on other states and are known as \"sanctuary states\". This is extremely important for cyber-attack states because when a cyber-attack comes from a sanctuary state, a victim-state can use active defenses and avoid crisis response.\nTherefore, we need to understand the answers to two key questions:\n- What does a state's duty to prevent cyber attacks mean?\nThis obligation in fact includes several smaller tasks to prevent cyber attacks, including the adoption of strict criminal laws, the vigorous enforcement of investigative procedures, the prosecution of attackers and, during the investigation and prosecution, cooperation with cyber-attack states. These are the duties of all states and are binding as customary international law. The authority for these duties comes from all three sources of international tradition in the field of law - international conventions, international customs and general principles of law common to civilized nations, as evidenced by the judgments and teachings of the most qualified international lawyers.\nThe only international treaty analogous to cybernetics is the European Convention on Cybercrime in 2001²⁰. Although the treaty is only a regional agreement, it is still very influential on customary international law because of the importance of the states that have ratified it, originating from the doctrine of the states particularly affected.\n---\n¹⁹Unlike conventional warfare, an autonomous and exclusive act of warfare in the cyber realm is difficult to conceive.\n²⁰Available at www.eur-lex.europa.eu.The Cybercrime Convention requires its parties to establish \"criminal\" offences for almost every conceivable type of cyber attack, in accordance with their domestic law.\nJournal of Law and Public Administration\nVolume VIII, Issue 15, 2022\nIn addition, it demonstrates the recognition by states of both the need to criminalize cyber attacks and the obligation of states to prevent their territory from being used by non-state actors to conduct cyber attacks against other states. The convention is also significant because it recognizes that cyber attacks cannot be banned during an attack, and the only way to prevent them is through aggressive law enforcement, coupled with state cooperation.\nInternational Terrorist Terrorism Treaties provide additional, albeit indirect, support for the duty to prevent cyber attacks. The international community recognizes terrorism as a threat to international peace and security, but no agreement has been reached on a definition. As a result, states have increasingly taken the approach of outlawing certain acts of terrorism - terrorists are constantly developing new methods of attack, rather than outlawing terrorism itself.\nThese treaties impose on states several common requirements regarding terrorist attacks, such as taking all practicable measures to prevent such attacks, criminalizing attacks, referring cases to the competent authorities for prosecution, and obliging states to cooperate with each other during criminal proceedings. Although these treaties do not address cyber attacks, the principles contained therein contribute to influencing state requirements under customary international law on terrorism. As there is growing evidence that cyberattacks will soon be an active weapon for terrorists, states should refer to the common principles found in these treaties as opinio juris when cyberattacks are used as a terrorist weapon.\n- What must a state do to avoid violating its duty to prevent?\nThe treatment of cyber attacks in accordance with their criminal law also proves the recognition of the duty of states to prevent cyber attacks. Many states criminalize such acts and prosecute cyber attacks to discourage attackers from committing law enforcement, which seems to be the only way to protect and prevent damage to their computer systems.\nThis gives credibility to the notion that, unlike a conventional attack, which can be stopped after detection, cyber attacks can only be stopped by setting ex ante barriers that attackers are trying to cross. Moreover, these practices demonstrate a growing acceptance among states that cyber attacks must be stopped and that the way to do this is to enforce the law.\nStates' responses to transnational terrorist attacks further support the recognition of a duty to prevent cyber attacks under customary international law. This involves the difficult task of analyzing data and clues about the existence and extent of such attacks.\nThe more cyber attacks resemble terrorism, the easier it will be to fit into the paradigm built to deal with transnational terrorism. However, regardless of their purpose, cyber attacks pose a threat to international peace and security and should be treated as a category of other recognized transnational threats.\nThe general principles of law common to civilized nations also support the recognition of the duty to prevent cyber attacks. It is a well-established principle in the domestic law of most states that individuals should be held liable for acts or omissions that have a causal link to the harm suffered by another person. While international law is not bound by the domestic laws of states, international law can be derived from the general principles common to the great legal systems of the world. Most states use causality as a principle for establishing individual responsibility, giving credibility to the idea that the responsibility of a state should also be based on causation.\nCyber attacks are extremely difficult for states to detect before committing a particular attack, and are often committed by individuals or groups who are not even on a state's radar. However, just because cyberattacks are difficult\n21Cyberspace, as a global electronic medium, cannot be dominated or controlled by a single nation.\n22Carr, Jeffrey, op. cit., p. 64.\n23For details on this issue and the analysis techniques that could be used, see Petersson, Gustav Jakob; Breul, Jonathan D. (2017), Cyber Society, Big Data, andxs Evaluation, Comparative Policy Evaluation, Volume 24 (colective papers), USA, pp. 47-75.\n24States's responsibility for negligence in taking all reasonable measures to prevent crime and to prosecute, prosecute and bring to justice transnational cybercriminals has also been recognized in international justice, such as the International Court of Justice. See, in this regard, Carr, Jeffrey, op.cit., p. 67.\nJournal of Law and Public Administration\nVolume VIII, Issue 15, 2022\nto prevent does not mean that states can breach their duty to prevent them, and by enforcing the law vigorously, they will deter cyberattacks. States that do not enact such laws do not fulfill their duty to prevent cyberattacks²⁵.\nA state's passivity and indifference to cyber attacks make it a sanctuary state, from which attackers can operate safely. When viewed in this light, it becomes clear that a state can be held indirectly responsible for cyber attacks in accordance with the established principles of customary international law.\nHost states will be judged on their efforts to catch and prosecute cyber-attackers, which is likely to be the main way in which states can deter and prevent future attacks. When victim states end up judging whether a host state has complied with its international obligations, the host states must cooperate with the former to ensure their transparency and good faith.\nOnce a host state proves that it is a sanctuary state by its inaction, the other states can blame it for cyber attacks originating in its territory. At that point, the host state becomes responsible for the cyber attack that triggered the initial investigation, as well as for all future cyber attacks that come from its borders. This opens the door for a victim state to use active defenses against the servers of the computers involved during a cyber attack.\nWhen attacks are carried out, most often by non-state actors, across state borders, attracting international responsibility (usually indirect), in this case, begins with an analysis of whether the armed attacks of non-state actors fall under the law of war continues with the duties that states have towards each other with regard to non-state actors on their territory²⁶, then moves on to ways of imputing state responsibility for the acts of non-state actors and ends with the legality of cross-border response operations against states²⁷.\nThus, a state's passivity or indifference to a non-state agent on its own territory could trigger its liability, possibly to the same extent, as if it had actively participated in the planning, an involvement that can be established by an analysis. post facto whether the state could have put more effort into preventing the cyber attack.\nBased on the above, it is clear that victim states can respond by force to armed attacks by non-state actors located in another state when host states violate their duty to prevent such attacks. If supplemented by cyber attacks, imputing state responsibility in this way gives states a legal way to use active defenses without the need to separately assign an attack to the state or its agents. In fact, imputation of liability is the equivalent of attributing the attack to the state or its agents.\nTherefore, in this case, it is essential to establish and explain why cyberattacks are armed attacks, which is the duty of a state to prevent cyberattacks, and the means and circumstances that would allow a victim state to respond by force to a cyber attack.\nMoreover, the attribution requirement perpetuates the \"response crisis\" because it is virtually impossible to attribute cyber attacks during the attack. Although states can track cyberattacks retroactively to the servers of computers in another state, conclusively establishing the identity of the attacker requires intensive investigation, which requires time and the help of the home state.\nGiven the ban on forcibly responding until an attack has been attributed to a state or its agents, coupled with the fact that the vast majority of cyber attacks are conducted by non-state actors, it should come as no surprise that states are reluctant to deal with cyber attacks as acts of war, thus risking violations of international law. This \"assignment issue\" blocks states in response²⁸.\n²⁵ Carr, Jeffrey, op.cit., p. 67.\n²⁶ It is a long-established principle of international law that a state is obliged to use diligence to prevent the commission of criminal acts against another nation or its people. Recognized in several international acts, the principle implies that a state cannot knowingly allow its territory to be used for actions contrary to the rights of other states. Of course, there is no absolute obligation on the host state to prevent all cyber attacks on its territory, but when a host state has the capacity to prevent an armed attack by non-state actors on its territory, it fails to do so. This violates its duty of prevention under international law.\n²⁷ For details on these stages, see Carr, Jeffrey, op.cit., p. 53 et seq.\n²⁸ For a graphic evolution, see Carr, Jeffrey, op.cit., p. 47.\nJournal of Law and Public Administration\nVolume VIII, Issue 15, 2022\nEarly detection and warning programs can help capture cyber attacks before they reach their climax, but even the best programs are not able to detect all cyber attacks.\nWhen an ongoing cyber attack has already caused a serious, immediate, invasive, direct, and measurable damage, it can be safely classified as an armed attack, even if it is still ongoing. On the other hand, when an attack did not cause such damage, the system administrator will have to consider: (1) a possible immediate future injury, (2) the likelihood of avoiding the attack with purely defensive measures, respectively (3) whether the attack should be classified as an imminent armed attack.\nAfter all, the state can avoid being the target of active defenses²⁹ from another state, even when the attacks come from its territory, by taking concrete measures to prevent cyber attacks, such as the implementation of cyber attacks. Of the legal framework on crime, the application of these laws and cooperation with victim states to bring the attackers to justice. In this endeavor, the human element, with all its strengths and weaknesses, is paramount.\nStates that violate their duty to prevent cyber attacks and refuse to change their practices should be held accountable - at least indirectly - for all subsequent attacks that come from within their borders, in accordance with the law of war. At a time when cyber attacks are threatening global security and states are struggling to find ways to improve their cyber defenses, there is no reason to protect sanctuary states from the legal use of active defenses by victim states, and there is every reason to increase the state's defense against cyber attacks.\nIn other words, states not only enjoy rights, but must also fulfill certain obligations under international law, among which the idea of \"due diligence\" occupies a central place - a state is obliged to use diligence to prevent the commission within the limits its criminal acts against other nations³⁰. This duty of states is continuous, compared to the need to protect other states against harmful acts of individuals - state or non-state actors, individuals or legal entities - launched from within their own jurisdictions (called \"sanctuary states\").\nIn this new age of cyber warfare, the Web is both a battlefield and an information space. Social services such as Twitter, Facebook, MySpace or LiveJournal are an essential part of the hacker's toolkit. Commonly known as the Social Web, these services provide an unprecedented repository of personal data, personal information about people, companies and governments, which can be used for financial crime, espionage and misinformation, both by state hackers and by non-state actors.\n## IV. Cyber espionage – an adjacent weapon in cyber warfare?\nCyber warfare - sometimes called \"bloodless war\" - is closely linked to cybercrime, cyber security, cyber terrorism, cyber espionage, cyberspace, the differentiation between these concepts being sensitive because they are largely intertwined. The armies of the world are struggling to cope with a new field of cyber battle, by delimiting and framing their actions in the sphere of practical applicability of these concepts.\nIt is often impossible to determine whether attempts to hack a computer in another state were acts of cyber warfare or cyber intelligence gathering. Unlike cyber attack activity, the collection of information is not always based on cyber exploitation as a facilitator³¹.\n²⁹ Active defense is the most appropriate type of force to use against cyber attacks in light of jus in bello principles. First of all, in terms of military necessity, active defense is probably the full force needed to carry out the mission of defending against a cyber attack. Active defense can track down an attack at the source and immediately annihilate it, while kinetic weapons will be slower and less effective than the speed of a hack-back. Therefore, the use of kinetic weapons to the detriment of active defense will not only be less effective, but will also violate the principle of necessity by employing force only for the sake of destruction. In addition, the choice between active defense versus kinetic weapons should reduce the possibility of escalating these situations on a large scale in armed conflicts between states.\n³⁰ Maurer, Tim (2018). Cyber mercenaries, The State, Hackers and Power, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, p. 130. The author refers to the jurisprudence of the International Court of Justice which stated that \"it is the obligation of each state not to knowingly allow the territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other states.\"\n³¹ For methods of collecting information in the virtual environment, see Oakley, Jacob G, op.cit., pp. 96 - 97. And for the relationship between cyber intelligence gathering, cyber reconnaissance and cyber attacks, broadly, op.cit., pp. 102-108.\nJournal of Law and Public Administration\nVolume VIII, Issue 15, 2022\nIn international law, cyberespionage has been defined as \"the practice of spying or using spies to obtain information about the plans and activities of a foreign government or a competing company\"³².\nAnother interesting thing about espionage is that it is not always sponsored or initiated by the enemy state. In fact, in many cases of espionage around the world, the person who collects information and transmits it to foreign powers has done so of his own free will, sometimes out of revenge and sometimes for reasons of financial compensation, or for other philosophical and ethical reasons.\nCyberespionage may seem similar, but it is different from a motivational point of view, with cyber manipulation activities. Manipulation, as a form of cyber attack, consists of controlling or modifying information, information systems and / or networks in cyberspace to create physical effects of denial, using deception, bait, conditioning, forgery, and other similar techniques. Use your opponent's information resources for the purpose of apparent friendship, to create clues that do not appear immediately in cyberspace. The targeted network may appear to be operating normally until side or tertiary effects occur, including proven physical effects of the attack³³.\n## V. Conclusions\nNo change in technology so far, however, seems to rival the potential for transformation as much as the development of offensive cyber capabilities. Indeed, this is demonstrated by the invention of a new label for the notion of war involving cyber attacks, namely \"cyber warfare\", as if it were not just a new type of weapon, but a whole new kind of war.\nIn the circumstances of the armed / classical war, the growing importance of both military and personal data or otherwise protected by law is obvious. In an age when individuals voluntarily understand how to transmit, store, and receive large amounts of personal data over the Internet, planting software in electronic devices to erase, modify, or approximate data is becoming a crucial new tactic of war: a \"fifth dimension battlefield\", as it is often said in doctrine, after air, sea, earth and outer space³⁴.\nThis change in staff has led to the merger of military and corporate espionage functions, and as a result, the militarization of cyberspace has created legal and moral ambiguity regarding privacy rights, as well as a personal responsibility to be targeted in cyberspace. virtue of the simple position it occupies in relation to an information network.\nThese tendencies contributed to the change in the structure of the war, with the result that the line distinction between the military and the civilian field blurred. Cyber warfare operations thus occupy a crucial position in the changing landscape of military conflict and require prompt response from the victim states, provided that the proportionality and correct identification of attackers and the international legal framework are respected.\nProportionality must be encouraged, for example, because it is a crucial issue in military ethics as well as in common criminal law. It requires that no more force be used than is necessary to repel an attack or to fulfill other legitimate objectives. But how do you determine what constitutes a necessary response to a cyber attack? More importantly, how should we determine if it is ever proportionate to launch an offensive cyber warfare counterattack? There are open-ended questions raised in the relevant literature, to which the practice is to be answered, being undoubtedly that the legitimate collective defense requires a more precise and responsible action against the dangers arising with the evolution of technology and its malicious use for which run counter to individual or collective safety."

Specific and the Commitment of State Responsibility Vasile COMAN Titu Maiorescu University, Romania Faculty of Law, Bucharest Law Doctoral School Prahova Court, Romania Criminal section, Ploiești v.comann@yahoo.com # Abstract: Due to their worrying presence, cyber attacks pose new challenges to states, both nationally and between states, and are almost non-existent during recent military conflicts. Global peace requires at the legal and practical level a firm reaction against their use, but with the observance of rules and limits of the intensity of the force used, including the real need and proportionality.\nThe study seeks to establish some guidelines under the mentioned aspects, far from being widely accepted in current legal and political doctrines, and can be a starting point in developing a predictable legislative framework effective, effective in action and decisive in preserving the real sense of security individual and collective.\nKeywords: cyber attacks; war; armed conflict; responsibility; state.\n# I. Introduction The presence of cybernetics in the modern life of states is a reality that can no longer be ignored, bringing undeniable benefits to people's well-being, but being accompanied by certain risks, the most important of which is the use of technological advantages for criminal or illicit purposes in general. The risk is real and it can already be seen empirically that in the case of recent armed conflicts (for example, the Russia-Ukraine conflict that began on February 24, 2022), the cyber component is not only used consistently, but is and targeted by attacks of the same nature by combatants.\nIt is important to note that, while the term\"cyber attack\"is often used in the literature, to date, all but a few effects of offensive cyber operations have remained below the level considered to be the use of force or armed attack, within the meaning of the provisions of the United Nations Charter. Moreover, malicious cyber activity can take place over an extended period of time - months, if not years - and is often not detected. For this reason, such activity is therefore better described as\"cyber operations\"than as\"attack.\"1.\nIn the military and international law, there are heated discussions about possible situations in which cyber attacks can be qualified as acts of war in themselves, especially when they take place during actual armed attacks. However, it is true that the increasing emergence of cyber attacks and the introduction of new technologies in the military and electronics industry have led to a fundamental change in the features that previously characterized acts of pure kinetic warfare, so it may seem necessary to adapt the law of war and international humanitarian law. which must evolve just as fast2.\nJournal of Law and Public Administration Volume VIII, Issue 15, 2022 ## II. Cyber Attacks. Specific and content In order to keep the internet safe and peaceful, it is vital to establish the constitutive content of cyber attacks, the manner of manifestation and the targets primarily targeted, so that they can be recognized when they occur or, ideally, in time.\nIdentifying the real actors behind a cyber attack is a notoriously difficult task, which increases exponentially in the event of an armed conflict. Attributing attacks to individual actors (states or international organizations, or private actors) is traditionally seen as an acid test to determine whether an attack is assessed as an act of cyber warfare that complements kinetic warfare, or just an act. conjunctural of cyber terrorism (\"cyber hooliganism\").\nCyber attribution is the act of tying together cyber activities in such an aggression, based on their attributes, to determine if they come from the same actor, the most difficult part being determining the motivation of the latter³. The logical attribution process consists of 4 steps: a) Discovering the indicators of compromise of the attacked systems - by administering evidence of unauthorized activity in a network or organization, b) Associating them together as belonging to specific actors based on their attributes, c) Precise identification of the actor, d) determination of the actor's motivation⁴.\nThe assignment process can target a particular unit, organization, or even individual behind the cyber activity. The award process is particularly important in this situation, in which, without identity and motivation, it is not possible to know who the enemy is and, implicitly, how to be annihilated with an active or passive response, tactical or technical, from the victim state⁵.\nUnlike weapons of mass destruction, cyber attacks are\"weapons of mass iritation\"⁶ and can cause a\"computer pandemic,\"and in the event of an armed conflict, they are non-physical in nature.\nCyber attacks are generally non-public and usually target government or private institutions, usually major financial institutions affecting public confidence in Internet-mediated transactions, severely disrupting their critical infrastructure and security architecture⁷.\nAmong the most publicized in recent years are cyber attacks in the 2008 Russia-Georgia conflict⁸, cyber attacks on Estonia in 2007 (the most important recent cyber war, which was led by a group of young pro-Kremlin⁹), the military operation of Russia in Chechnya, which have shown that computer systems are an important component of future wars, so concrete legislative measures are needed to limit and eliminate attacks in this area.\nDuring an armed conflict, the cybernetic component unequivocally plays a key role, disrupting the electronic communication systems of combat units; it is a quasi-official part of the military war strategies developed by states.\nJens David; Govern, Kevin; Finkelstein, Claire (2015), Cyberwar. Law and Ethics for Virtual Conflicts, Oxford: Oxford University Press, United Kingdom, pp. 16-17.\n³ Oakley, Jacob G. (2019), Waging cyberwar. technical challenges and operational constraints, New York: Apress Publishing, USA, pp. 114.\n⁴ For details on the steps to be taken in cyber attack, see Oakley, Jacob G., op.cit., pp. 116-130.\n⁵ Moreover, the award decision must weigh operationally other concerns, political ramifications, strategic impacts and even moral dilemmas.\n⁶ Carr, Jeffrey (2012), Inside Cyber Warfare. Mapping the cyberunderworld, Sebastopol, California: O'Reilly Media Inc., p. 8.\n⁷ Covert cyber actions can be of two general types: (1) propaganda and misinformation that would be the subject of psychological operations to manipulate the evolution of the real armed conflict; and, (2) actions to shut down the computer networks of the target countries ⁸ On the cyber side of the war in Georgia, coordinated by www.stopGeorgia.info (located in Germany) and www.stopGeorgia.ru (located in the USA), see, José Rios, Maria; Tenreiro de Magalhães, Sérgio; Santos, Leonel, The Georgia's cyberwar, available at www.researchgate.net. The attacks consisted mainly of SQL Injection and DDoS actions.\n⁹ The immediate cause of the cyber attacks on Estonia was the Estonian government's decision to move a war memorial of the Soviet Army from central Tallinn, the capital of Estonia. Many Estonians see the memorial as a harsh reminder of the former Soviet Union's\"occupation\"of Estonia, while many Russians see the statue as a memorial to the Red Army's sacrifices in liberating Estonia from Nazi Germany.\nJournal of Law and Public Administration Volume VIII, Issue 15, 2022 There are multi-national private hackers (nonstate hackers or patriotic hackers) secretly hired by states to move the real origin and responsibility for plausible deniability, while they enjoy the results of the attackers and support them. these by providing the necessary resources¹⁰.\nThus, in times of armed conflict or political tension between states, some members of a state's citizens may be motivated to support the country's war or political effort by taking direct action on the cyber component of the enemy involved in the conflict. Hackers (\"patriotic hackers\") are private citizens qualified in cyber attack capabilities, who can initiate a cyber attack against another state on their own. They may do so without the consent, direction or control of the State to which they belong or in whose territory they are located¹¹. However, there have been incidents in which it is suspected that hacktivists were encouraged and aided by the state, being used as proxies (eg the 2007 cyber attack on Estonia, attributed by the West to Russia)¹².\nRegardless of the origin of the perpetrator, cyber attacks in the context of an armed conflict can have the following objectives: a) Exposing current realities (eg in 2008 in the context of the Israeli-led war against Palestine, Israeli hackers penetrated Palestinian TV and radio stations, inserting scenes with the death of Palestinian leaders).\nb) Implement malicious attack programs on unmanned military drones (eg Conficker C virus) frequently used in armed conflict, compared to the reality that military units understand the strategic and tactical need for unmanned aerial systems (UAS), making them an integral part of their arsenal of monitoring or even attacking the enemy¹³.\nb) The paralysis of the targeted websites for certain periods of time and the blocking of the normal activity of some critical institutions of the state, with indirect consequences on the public services, including of some smaller businesses / firms; attackers can change the language used by the attacked sites or the IP address (eg in the 2008 Gaza war - the\"cast lead\"operation), or post messages against the war or with the dead violence.\nc) indirectly causing material damage to the institutions or legal or even natural persons concerned - even by restricting regular access to the Internet, by attacks on governmental (political¹⁴) or commercial sites, or by silencing political opponents.\nFor example, in the 2009 elections in Iran, when the government decided to shut down the internet in the country in order to stop the massive protests of election fraud, carried out through Facebook and Twitter, in a context in which hackers from opposition parties would have launched DDoS attacks on government sites.\nd) collecting relevant data sought by penetrating networks, including by creating fictitious pages (phishing) or fictitious groups on social networks - communication (eg, Facebook, Telegram) to influence the mood of the population concerned.\nThe purpose is to shape and control public opinion about how events actually unfolded by DDoS, SQL Injection, or Crosssite scripting (XSS) attacks on government sites (Government, Banks, Parliament, Ministries, Lines). communication, embassy websites) ¹⁰ We emphasize that international law presupposes that armed conflict is initiated only by states (as subjects of law) and not by groups or individuals.\n¹¹ Demonstrating a link between non-state actors, hacktivists and the beneficiary government can be difficult, sometimes impossible or takes too long to confirm that the competent legal authority of the target state can take swift response.\n¹² As we will see in the section on the attribution and imputability of cyber attacks, according to international law, if patriotic hackers carry out a cyber attack against another state that rises to the level of an\"armed attack\", the victim state has the legal right, acting inself-defense, to use force against those hackers.\n¹³ From missiles armed with missiles or bombs to so-called traditional ammunition drones (also known as kamikaze drones), this unmanned technology completes many new challenges and opens up a whole new set of possibilities for armed forces around the world.\n¹⁴ Politically motivated cyber attacks range in sophistication, from small-scale denial of simple attacks to well-organized and covert espionage attacks. The sophistication of a cyber attack depends on the skill of the attackers and the amount of reconnaissance performed before the attack. For considerations regarding cyber warfare capabilities in Australia, Brazil, Canada, North Korea, Estonia, Czech Republic, France, Germany, India, Iran, Israel, Italy, Kenya, NATO, China, Pakistan, etc. - see Carr, Jeffrey, op.cit., pp. 243 - 262. An example of a political attack is during the 2009 Nigerian elections to control election information.\nJournal of Law and Public Administration Volume VIII, Issue 15, 2022 e) for recognizing and imposing a supremacy between cyber hackers, taking advantage of the context of kinetic conflict. For example, during the 2006-2008 Gaza war (eg Team Evil, Cold Zero, - formats for resistance to the Gaza war).\nThis notoriety can also occur through the acquisition of cyber attacks during major social crises or key moments in society (eg presidential elections, change of political regime). Among those known, Team Hell - a group of hackers with political or religious orientations, Agd_Scorp, Jurm Team, C-H Team, Gaza Hacker Team, DNS Team, DZ Team, etc. were mentioned in the literature¹⁵.\nf) to transmit signals of the cyber capacity of a state, to other states in conflict or competition (eg in 2009, on the day of the USA were attacked several strategic sites, of some government institutions and of some private companies - which carries out contracts with the state on military projects, in this sense being suspected North Korea).\ng) the insertion of sophisticated viruses in the target computers, for the exploitation of resources or the search for classified information, and if the compromised computer system is part of a larger network, the attacker obtains access to the main network; it takes advantage of the fact that antivirus technology simply cannot keep pace with known threats, much less those they are unaware of¹⁶.\nIn the case of armed (kinetic) conflicts, the targets of interest (cyber bullets) include hubs and other crucial links in the system that move enemy troops involved in the war, such as ports, airports, means of transport, battlefield facilities and communications. Targets could include computer systems located in the enemy state or abroad, command and control nodes, spatial information, surveillance, and means of recognition and communication, command, control and information systems.\nOne such example is cyber attacks on tanks used in a pending military operation, in which a state may have a cyber weapon capable of harming its enemy's tanks. Tanks are equipped with computerized weapon systems in today's armies and could be susceptible to cyber attacks¹⁷. A single cyber weapon may be able to stop the controls of the electric motor or the tank, virtually eliminating it from combat. Another cyber weapon can attack the warhead reinforcement system or the targeting system for the same purpose. Both effects are considered cyber attacks.\nPredictably, cyber attacks will target telecommunications infrastructure (e.g., a virus designed to shut off power to military installations), transportation infrastructure, secure networks, the economy, energy (generating blackouts), security breaches, and disabling security breaches. programs to protect the targeted systems, sometimes leaving graffiti behind in the attacked sites (containing information about certain exposed individuals) or on the main page, the online banking payment systems.\nAs a way of action, hack tek strategies are developed by organized crime in cyber underground labs and usually start by attacking individual servers or computers by infecting with Trojan viruses, such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)¹⁸ and SQL Injection.\nThe more advanced the technology, the more attacks appeared in forms not previously covered by official statements and state practices.\nCyber attacks come in many different forms, their destructive potential being limited only by the creativity and skill of the attackers behind them, and usually a kinetic attack is combined with a support cyber attack. Although it may seem intuitive that cyberattacks may constitute armed attacks, especially in light of their indirect ability to injure or kill, the legal ¹⁵ For details on the profile of these groups of hackers and their guidelines, see Carr, Jeffrey, op.cit., pp. 22-27.\n¹⁶ Often, the selection of the target is given two main considerations: the value of the information that will be obtained and the difficulty of success in operation (to exclude the probability of detection).\n¹⁷ The same goes for intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). ICBM launchers are developed within the limits of state secrecy and can essentially hit anywhere in the world in the execution of an attack. Although countermeasures capable of intercepting ICBMs have been developed, some states, such as Russia and North Korea, have recently announced that they have developed models that cannot be intercepted at this time (eg Sarmat / Satan 2, in the case of Russia).\n¹⁸ DDoS attacks typically disrupt communications and computing capabilities by sending huge amounts of (sometimes malformed) traffic to devices to alter or deny their ability to function as originally intended. They are common on the Internet because they are relatively unsophisticated and can be targeted from an Internet presence point in the cyberspace of one state against one in another enemy state.\nJournal of Law and Public Administration Volume VIII, Issue 15, 2022 community has been reluctant to take this approach, as cyberattacks do not resemble traditional armed attacks with conventional weapons, having another specific manifestation¹⁹.\nThe exploitation of computer systems in cyber warfare is, in fact, an exploitation of the human errors of those who thought and built them into their elements - ways of exploiting, reconfiguring or overwriting computer programs (eg, a virtual gateway which uses facial recognition is altered, nullifying the image component, or a cyber attack that corrupts the hard disks of the surveillance cameras where their recordings are stored, or the steering systems of some devices engaged in kinetic warfare).\n## III. Establishing the responsibility of the state for cyber attacks carried out on its territory States may not respond to a cross-border cyber attack by force without first establishing the State's responsibility for the attack. Although historically this has meant that an attack has taken place, to be attributed to a state or its agents, direct control of an attack is no longer a requirement of state responsibility. Today, international law is based on the responsibility of a state and only on the breach of its international obligations to prevent and combat it.\nThis change is particularly important for cyber attacks, as the prevailing view is that cross-border cyber attacks should be treated as a criminal matter rather than a national security issue, and this seems to be based on the historical view of state responsibility. This limited view of state responsibility blocks attacked states in the response crisis by requiring states to attribute cyber attacks to a state or its agents before responding through active defenses, even if the likelihood of successfully assigning a ranged attack is generally uncertain. Consequently, states in crisis in response to a cyber attack act under the false assumption that they must decide between effective but illegal active defenses and the less effective but legal path of passive defenses and the scope of domestic criminal law.\nGiven the perspective of state responsibility, states should first determine whether the cyber attack can be blamed on the home state. Once a cyber attack is blamed on a state and that state refuses to comply with its international obligations, the legal barriers to self-defense action disappear.\nWith regard to cyber attacks, the accepted principles of common *jus ad bellum* still support the imputation of state responsibility for armed attacks by non-state actors when the attacks come from a state that allows non-state actors to carry out criminal operations within their borders. States that allow non-state actors to carry out these operations are in breach of their duty to prevent attacks on other states and are known as\"sanctuary states\". This is extremely important for cyber-attack states because when a cyber-attack comes from a sanctuary state, a victim-state can use active defenses and avoid crisis response.\nTherefore, we need to understand the answers to two key questions: - What does a state's duty to prevent cyber attacks mean?\nThis obligation in fact includes several smaller tasks to prevent cyber attacks, including the adoption of strict criminal laws, the vigorous enforcement of investigative procedures, the prosecution of attackers and, during the investigation and prosecution, cooperation with cyber-attack states. These are the duties of all states and are binding as customary international law. The authority for these duties comes from all three sources of international tradition in the field of law - international conventions, international customs and general principles of law common to civilized nations, as evidenced by the judgments and teachings of the most qualified international lawyers.\nThe only international treaty analogous to cybernetics is the European Convention on Cybercrime in 2001²⁰. Although the treaty is only a regional agreement, it is still very influential on customary international law because of the importance of the states that have ratified it, originating from the doctrine of the states particularly affected.\n--- ¹⁹Unlike conventional warfare, an autonomous and exclusive act of warfare in the cyber realm is difficult to conceive.\n²⁰Available at www.eur-lex.europa.eu.The Cybercrime Convention requires its parties to establish\"criminal\"offences for almost every conceivable type of cyber attack, in accordance with their domestic law.\nJournal of Law and Public Administration Volume VIII, Issue 15, 2022 In addition, it demonstrates the recognition by states of both the need to criminalize cyber attacks and the obligation of states to prevent their territory from being used by non-state actors to conduct cyber attacks against other states. The convention is also significant because it recognizes that cyber attacks cannot be banned during an attack, and the only way to prevent them is through aggressive law enforcement, coupled with state cooperation.\nInternational Terrorist Terrorism Treaties provide additional, albeit indirect, support for the duty to prevent cyber attacks. The international community recognizes terrorism as a threat to international peace and security, but no agreement has been reached on a definition. As a result, states have increasingly taken the approach of outlawing certain acts of terrorism - terrorists are constantly developing new methods of attack, rather than outlawing terrorism itself.\nThese treaties impose on states several common requirements regarding terrorist attacks, such as taking all practicable measures to prevent such attacks, criminalizing attacks, referring cases to the competent authorities for prosecution, and obliging states to cooperate with each other during criminal proceedings[21]. Although these treaties do not address cyber attacks, the principles contained therein contribute to influencing state requirements under customary international law on terrorism. As there is growing evidence that cyberattacks will soon be an active weapon for terrorists, states should refer to the common principles found in these treaties as opinio juris when cyberattacks are used as a terrorist weapon.\n- What must a state do to avoid violating its duty to prevent?\nThe treatment of cyber attacks in accordance with their criminal law also proves the recognition of the duty of states to prevent cyber attacks. Many states criminalize such acts and prosecute cyber attacks to discourage attackers from committing law enforcement, which seems to be the only way to protect and prevent damage to their computer systems.\nThis gives credibility to the notion that, unlike a conventional attack, which can be stopped after detection, cyber attacks can only be stopped by setting ex ante barriers that attackers are trying to cross. Moreover, these practices demonstrate a growing acceptance among states that cyber attacks must be stopped and that the way to do this is to enforce the law[22].\nStates' responses to transnational terrorist attacks further support the recognition of a duty to prevent cyber attacks under customary international law. This involves the difficult task of analyzing data and clues about the existence and extent of such attacks[23].\nThe more cyber attacks resemble terrorism, the easier it will be to fit into the paradigm built to deal with transnational terrorism. However, regardless of their purpose, cyber attacks pose a threat to international peace and security and should be treated as a category of other recognized transnational threats.\nThe general principles of law common to civilized nations also support the recognition of the duty to prevent cyber attacks. It is a well-established principle in the domestic law of most states that individuals should be held liable for acts or omissions that have a causal link to the harm suffered by another person. While international law is not bound by the domestic laws of states, international law can be derived from the general principles common to the great legal systems of the world. Most states use causality as a principle for establishing individual responsibility, giving credibility to the idea that the responsibility of a state should also be based on causation[24].\nCyber attacks are extremely difficult for states to detect before committing a particular attack, and are often committed by individuals or groups who are not even on a state's radar. However, just because cyberattacks are difficult 21Cyberspace, as a global electronic medium, cannot be dominated or controlled by a single nation.\n22Carr, Jeffrey, op. cit., p. 64.\n23For details on this issue and the analysis techniques that could be used, see Petersson, Gustav Jakob; Breul, Jonathan D. (2017), Cyber Society, Big Data, andxs Evaluation, Comparative Policy Evaluation, Volume 24 (colective papers), USA, pp. 47-75.\n24States's responsibility for negligence in taking all reasonable measures to prevent crime and to prosecute, prosecute and bring to justice transnational cybercriminals has also been recognized in international justice, such as the International Court of Justice. See, in this regard, Carr, Jeffrey, op.cit., p. 67.\nJournal of Law and Public Administration Volume VIII, Issue 15, 2022 to prevent does not mean that states can breach their duty to prevent them, and by enforcing the law vigorously, they will deter cyberattacks. States that do not enact such laws do not fulfill their duty to prevent cyberattacks²⁵.\nA state's passivity and indifference to cyber attacks make it a sanctuary state, from which attackers can operate safely. When viewed in this light, it becomes clear that a state can be held indirectly responsible for cyber attacks in accordance with the established principles of customary international law.\nHost states will be judged on their efforts to catch and prosecute cyber-attackers, which is likely to be the main way in which states can deter and prevent future attacks. When victim states end up judging whether a host state has complied with its international obligations, the host states must cooperate with the former to ensure their transparency and good faith.\nOnce a host state proves that it is a sanctuary state by its inaction, the other states can blame it for cyber attacks originating in its territory. At that point, the host state becomes responsible for the cyber attack that triggered the initial investigation, as well as for all future cyber attacks that come from its borders. This opens the door for a victim state to use active defenses against the servers of the computers involved during a cyber attack.\nWhen attacks are carried out, most often by non-state actors, across state borders, attracting international responsibility (usually indirect), in this case, begins with an analysis of whether the armed attacks of non-state actors fall under the law of war continues with the duties that states have towards each other with regard to non-state actors on their territory²⁶, then moves on to ways of imputing state responsibility for the acts of non-state actors and ends with the legality of cross-border response operations against states²⁷.\nThus, a state's passivity or indifference to a non-state agent on its own territory could trigger its liability, possibly to the same extent, as if it had actively participated in the planning, an involvement that can be established by an analysis. post facto whether the state could have put more effort into preventing the cyber attack.\nBased on the above, it is clear that victim states can respond by force to armed attacks by non-state actors located in another state when host states violate their duty to prevent such attacks. If supplemented by cyber attacks, imputing state responsibility in this way gives states a legal way to use active defenses without the need to separately assign an attack to the state or its agents. In fact, imputation of liability is the equivalent of attributing the attack to the state or its agents.\nTherefore, in this case, it is essential to establish and explain why cyberattacks are armed attacks, which is the duty of a state to prevent cyberattacks, and the means and circumstances that would allow a victim state to respond by force to a cyber attack.\nMoreover, the attribution requirement perpetuates the\"response crisis\"because it is virtually impossible to attribute cyber attacks during the attack. Although states can track cyberattacks retroactively to the servers of computers in another state, conclusively establishing the identity of the attacker requires intensive investigation, which requires time and the help of the home state.\nGiven the ban on forcibly responding until an attack has been attributed to a state or its agents, coupled with the fact that the vast majority of cyber attacks are conducted by non-state actors, it should come as no surprise that states are reluctant to deal with cyber attacks as acts of war, thus risking violations of international law. This\"assignment issue\"blocks states in response²⁸.\n²⁵ Carr, Jeffrey, op.cit., p. 67.\n²⁶ It is a long-established principle of international law that a state is obliged to use diligence to prevent the commission of criminal acts against another nation or its people. Recognized in several international acts, the principle implies that a state cannot knowingly allow its territory to be used for actions contrary to the rights of other states. Of course, there is no absolute obligation on the host state to prevent all cyber attacks on its territory, but when a host state has the capacity to prevent an armed attack by non-state actors on its territory, it fails to do so. This violates its duty of prevention under international law.\n²⁷ For details on these stages, see Carr, Jeffrey, op.cit., p. 53 et seq.\n²⁸ For a graphic evolution, see Carr, Jeffrey, op.cit., p. 47.\nJournal of Law and Public Administration Volume VIII, Issue 15, 2022 Early detection and warning programs can help capture cyber attacks before they reach their climax, but even the best programs are not able to detect all cyber attacks.\nWhen an ongoing cyber attack has already caused a serious, immediate, invasive, direct, and measurable damage, it can be safely classified as an armed attack, even if it is still ongoing. On the other hand, when an attack did not cause such damage, the system administrator will have to consider: (1) a possible immediate future injury, (2) the likelihood of avoiding the attack with purely defensive measures, respectively (3) whether the attack should be classified as an imminent armed attack.\nAfter all, the state can avoid being the target of active defenses²⁹ from another state, even when the attacks come from its territory, by taking concrete measures to prevent cyber attacks, such as the implementation of cyber attacks. Of the legal framework on crime, the application of these laws and cooperation with victim states to bring the attackers to justice. In this endeavor, the human element, with all its strengths and weaknesses, is paramount.\nStates that violate their duty to prevent cyber attacks and refuse to change their practices should be held accountable - at least indirectly - for all subsequent attacks that come from within their borders, in accordance with the law of war. At a time when cyber attacks are threatening global security and states are struggling to find ways to improve their cyber defenses, there is no reason to protect sanctuary states from the legal use of active defenses by victim states, and there is every reason to increase the state's defense against cyber attacks.\nIn other words, states not only enjoy rights, but must also fulfill certain obligations under international law, among which the idea of\"due diligence\"occupies a central place - a state is obliged to use diligence to prevent the commission within the limits its criminal acts against other nations³⁰. This duty of states is continuous, compared to the need to protect other states against harmful acts of individuals - state or non-state actors, individuals or legal entities - launched from within their own jurisdictions (called\"sanctuary states\").\nIn this new age of cyber warfare, the Web is both a battlefield and an information space. Social services such as Twitter, Facebook, MySpace or LiveJournal are an essential part of the hacker's toolkit. Commonly known as the Social Web, these services provide an unprecedented repository of personal data, personal information about people, companies and governments, which can be used for financial crime, espionage and misinformation, both by state hackers and by non-state actors.\n## IV. Cyber espionage – an adjacent weapon in cyber warfare?\nCyber warfare - sometimes called\"bloodless war\"- is closely linked to cybercrime, cyber security, cyber terrorism, cyber espionage, cyberspace, the differentiation between these concepts being sensitive because they are largely intertwined. The armies of the world are struggling to cope with a new field of cyber battle, by delimiting and framing their actions in the sphere of practical applicability of these concepts.\nIt is often impossible to determine whether attempts to hack a computer in another state were acts of cyber warfare or cyber intelligence gathering. Unlike cyber attack activity, the collection of information is not always based on cyber exploitation as a facilitator³¹.\n²⁹ Active defense is the most appropriate type of force to use against cyber attacks in light of jus in bello principles. First of all, in terms of military necessity, active defense is probably the full force needed to carry out the mission of defending against a cyber attack. Active defense can track down an attack at the source and immediately annihilate it, while kinetic weapons will be slower and less effective than the speed of a hack-back. Therefore, the use of kinetic weapons to the detriment of active defense will not only be less effective, but will also violate the principle of necessity by employing force only for the sake of destruction. In addition, the choice between active defense versus kinetic weapons should reduce the possibility of escalating these situations on a large scale in armed conflicts between states.\n³⁰ Maurer, Tim (2018). Cyber mercenaries, The State, Hackers and Power, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, p. 130. The author refers to the jurisprudence of the International Court of Justice which stated that\"it is the obligation of each state not to knowingly allow the territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other states.\"³¹ For methods of collecting information in the virtual environment, see Oakley, Jacob G, op.cit., pp. 96 - 97. And for the relationship between cyber intelligence gathering, cyber reconnaissance and cyber attacks, broadly, op.cit., pp. 102-108.\nJournal of Law and Public Administration Volume VIII, Issue 15, 2022 In international law, cyberespionage has been defined as\"the practice of spying or using spies to obtain information about the plans and activities of a foreign government or a competing company\"³².\nAnother interesting thing about espionage is that it is not always sponsored or initiated by the enemy state. In fact, in many cases of espionage around the world, the person who collects information and transmits it to foreign powers has done so of his own free will, sometimes out of revenge and sometimes for reasons of financial compensation, or for other philosophical and ethical reasons.\nCyberespionage may seem similar, but it is different from a motivational point of view, with cyber manipulation activities. Manipulation, as a form of cyber attack, consists of controlling or modifying information, information systems and / or networks in cyberspace to create physical effects of denial, using deception, bait, conditioning, forgery, and other similar techniques. Use your opponent's information resources for the purpose of apparent friendship, to create clues that do not appear immediately in cyberspace. The targeted network may appear to be operating normally until side or tertiary effects occur, including proven physical effects of the attack³³.\n## V. Conclusions No change in technology so far, however, seems to rival the potential for transformation as much as the development of offensive cyber capabilities. Indeed, this is demonstrated by the invention of a new label for the notion of war involving cyber attacks, namely\"cyber warfare\", as if it were not just a new type of weapon, but a whole new kind of war.\nIn the circumstances of the armed / classical war, the growing importance of both military and personal data or otherwise protected by law is obvious. In an age when individuals voluntarily understand how to transmit, store, and receive large amounts of personal data over the Internet, planting software in electronic devices to erase, modify, or approximate data is becoming a crucial new tactic of war: a\"fifth dimension battlefield\", as it is often said in doctrine, after air, sea, earth and outer space³⁴.\nThis change in staff has led to the merger of military and corporate espionage functions, and as a result, the militarization of cyberspace has created legal and moral ambiguity regarding privacy rights, as well as a personal responsibility to be targeted in cyberspace. virtue of the simple position it occupies in relation to an information network.\nThese tendencies contributed to the change in the structure of the war, with the result that the line distinction between the military and the civilian field blurred. Cyber warfare operations thus occupy a crucial position in the changing landscape of military conflict and require prompt response from the victim states, provided that the proportionality and correct identification of attackers and the international legal framework are respected.\nProportionality must be encouraged, for example, because it is a crucial issue in military ethics as well as in common criminal law. It requires that no more force be used than is necessary to repel an attack or to fulfill other legitimate objectives. But how do you determine what constitutes a necessary response to a cyber attack? More importantly, how should we determine if it is ever proportionate to launch an offensive cyber warfare counterattack? There are open-ended questions raised in the relevant literature, to which the practice is to be answered, being undoubtedly that the legitimate collective defense requires a more precise and responsible action against the dangers arising with the evolution of technology and its malicious use for which run counter to individual or collective safety."

Introduction The presence of cybernetics in the modern life of states is a reality that can no longer be ignored, bringing undeniable benefits to people's well-being, but being accompanied by certain risks, the most important of which is the use of technological advantages for criminal or illicit purposes in general. The risk is real and it can already be seen empirically that in the case of recent armed conflicts (for example, the Russia-Ukraine conflict that began on February 24, 2022), the cyber component is not only used consistently, but is and targeted by attacks of the same nature by combatants.\n\nIt is important to note that, while the term\"cyber attack\"is often used in the literature, to date, all but a few effects of offensive cyber operations have remained below the level considered to be the use of force or armed attack, within the meaning of the provisions of the United Nations Charter. Moreover, malicious cyber activity can take place over an extended period of time - months, if not years - and is often not detected. For this reason, such activity is therefore better described as\"cyber operations\"than as\"attack.\"1.\nIn the military and international law, there are heated discussions about possible situations in which cyber attacks can be qualified as acts of war in themselves, especially when they take place during actual armed attacks. However, it is true that the increasing emergence of cyber attacks and the introduction of new technologies in the military and electronics industry have led to a fundamental change in the features that previously characterized acts of pure kinetic warfare, so it may seem necessary to adapt the law of war and international humanitarian law. which must evolve just as fast2.\nJournal of Law and Public Administration Volume VIII, Issue 15, 2022 ## II. Cyber Attacks. Specific and content In order to keep the internet safe and peaceful, it is vital to establish the constitutive content of cyber attacks, the manner of manifestation and the targets primarily targeted, so that they can be recognized when they occur or, ideally, in time.\nIdentifying the real actors behind a cyber attack is a notoriously difficult task, which increases exponentially in the event of an armed conflict. Attributing attacks to individual actors (states or international organizations, or private actors) is traditionally seen as an acid test to determine whether an attack is assessed as an act of cyber warfare that complements kinetic warfare, or just an act. conjunctural of cyber terrorism (\"cyber hooliganism\").\nCyber attribution is the act of tying together cyber activities in such an aggression, based on their attributes, to determine if they come from the same actor, the most difficult part being determining the motivation of the latter³. The logical attribution process consists of 4 steps: a) Discovering the indicators of compromise of the attacked systems - by administering evidence of unauthorized activity in a network or organization, b) Associating them together as belonging to specific actors based on their attributes, c) Precise identification of the actor, d) determination of the actor's motivation⁴.\nThe assignment process can target a particular unit, organization, or even individual behind the cyber activity. The award process is particularly important in this situation, in which, without identity and motivation, it is not possible to know who the enemy is and, implicitly, how to be annihilated with an active or passive response, tactical or technical, from the victim state⁵.\nUnlike weapons of mass destruction, cyber attacks are\"weapons of mass iritation\"⁶ and can cause a\"computer pandemic,\"and in the event of an armed conflict, they are non-physical in nature.\nCyber attacks are generally non-public and usually target government or private institutions, usually major financial institutions affecting public confidence in Internet-mediated transactions, severely disrupting their critical infrastructure and security architecture⁷.\nAmong the most publicized in recent years are cyber attacks in the 2008 Russia-Georgia conflict⁸, cyber attacks on Estonia in 2007 (the most important recent cyber war, which was led by a group of young pro-Kremlin⁹), the military operation of Russia in Chechnya, which have shown that computer systems are an important component of future wars, so concrete legislative measures are needed to limit and eliminate attacks in this area.\nDuring an armed conflict, the cybernetic component unequivocally plays a key role, disrupting the electronic communication systems of combat units; it is a quasi-official part of the military war strategies developed by states.\nJens David; Govern, Kevin; Finkelstein, Claire (2015), Cyberwar. Law and Ethics for Virtual Conflicts, Oxford: Oxford University Press, United Kingdom, pp. 16-17.\n³ Oakley, Jacob G. (2019), Waging cyberwar. technical challenges and operational constraints, New York: Apress Publishing, USA, pp. 114.\n⁴ For details on the steps to be taken in cyber attack, see Oakley, Jacob G., op.cit., pp. 116-130.\n⁵ Moreover, the award decision must weigh operationally other concerns, political ramifications, strategic impacts and even moral dilemmas.\n⁶ Carr, Jeffrey (2012), Inside Cyber Warfare. Mapping the cyberunderworld, Sebastopol, California: O'Reilly Media Inc., p. 8.\n⁷ Covert cyber actions can be of two general types: (1) propaganda and misinformation that would be the subject of psychological operations to manipulate the evolution of the real armed conflict; and, (2) actions to shut down the computer networks of the target countries ⁸ On the cyber side of the war in Georgia, coordinated by www.stopGeorgia.info (located in Germany) and www.stopGeorgia.ru (located in the USA), see, José Rios, Maria; Tenreiro de Magalhães, Sérgio; Santos, Leonel, The Georgia's cyberwar, available at www.researchgate.net. The attacks consisted mainly of SQL Injection and DDoS actions.\n⁹ The immediate cause of the cyber attacks on Estonia was the Estonian government's decision to move a war memorial of the Soviet Army from central Tallinn, the capital of Estonia. Many Estonians see the memorial as a harsh reminder of the former Soviet Union's\"occupation\"of Estonia, while many Russians see the statue as a memorial to the Red Army's sacrifices in liberating Estonia from Nazi Germany.\nJournal of Law and Public Administration Volume VIII, Issue 15, 2022 There are multi-national private hackers (nonstate hackers or patriotic hackers) secretly hired by states to move the real origin and responsibility for plausible deniability, while they enjoy the results of the attackers and support them. these by providing the necessary resources¹⁰.\nThus, in times of armed conflict or political tension between states, some members of a state's citizens may be motivated to support the country's war or political effort by taking direct action on the cyber component of the enemy involved in the conflict. Hackers (\"patriotic hackers\") are private citizens qualified in cyber attack capabilities, who can initiate a cyber attack against another state on their own. They may do so without the consent, direction or control of the State to which they belong or in whose territory they are located¹¹. However, there have been incidents in which it is suspected that hacktivists were encouraged and aided by the state, being used as proxies (eg the 2007 cyber attack on Estonia, attributed by the West to Russia)¹².\nRegardless of the origin of the perpetrator, cyber attacks in the context of an armed conflict can have the following objectives: a) Exposing current realities (eg in 2008 in the context of the Israeli-led war against Palestine, Israeli hackers penetrated Palestinian TV and radio stations, inserting scenes with the death of Palestinian leaders).\nb) Implement malicious attack programs on unmanned military drones (eg Conficker C virus) frequently used in armed conflict, compared to the reality that military units understand the strategic and tactical need for unmanned aerial systems (UAS), making them an integral part of their arsenal of monitoring or even attacking the enemy¹³.\nb) The paralysis of the targeted websites for certain periods of time and the blocking of the normal activity of some critical institutions of the state, with indirect consequences on the public services, including of some smaller businesses / firms; attackers can change the language used by the attacked sites or the IP address (eg in the 2008 Gaza war - the\"cast lead\"operation), or post messages against the war or with the dead violence.\nc) indirectly causing material damage to the institutions or legal or even natural persons concerned - even by restricting regular access to the Internet, by attacks on governmental (political¹⁴) or commercial sites, or by silencing political opponents.\nFor example, in the 2009 elections in Iran, when the government decided to shut down the internet in the country in order to stop the massive protests of election fraud, carried out through Facebook and Twitter, in a context in which hackers from opposition parties would have launched DDoS attacks on government sites.\nd) collecting relevant data sought by penetrating networks, including by creating fictitious pages (phishing) or fictitious groups on social networks - communication (eg, Facebook, Telegram) to influence the mood of the population concerned.\nThe purpose is to shape and control public opinion about how events actually unfolded by DDoS, SQL Injection, or Crosssite scripting (XSS) attacks on government sites (Government, Banks, Parliament, Ministries, Lines). communication, embassy websites) ¹⁰ We emphasize that international law presupposes that armed conflict is initiated only by states (as subjects of law) and not by groups or individuals.\n¹¹ Demonstrating a link between non-state actors, hacktivists and the beneficiary government can be difficult, sometimes impossible or takes too long to confirm that the competent legal authority of the target state can take swift response.\n¹² As we will see in the section on the attribution and imputability of cyber attacks, according to international law, if patriotic hackers carry out a cyber attack against another state that rises to the level of an\"armed attack\", the victim state has the legal right, acting inself-defense, to use force against those hackers.\n¹³ From missiles armed with missiles or bombs to so-called traditional ammunition drones (also known as kamikaze drones), this unmanned technology completes many new challenges and opens up a whole new set of possibilities for armed forces around the world.\n¹⁴ Politically motivated cyber attacks range in sophistication, from small-scale denial of simple attacks to well-organized and covert espionage attacks. The sophistication of a cyber attack depends on the skill of the attackers and the amount of reconnaissance performed before the attack. For considerations regarding cyber warfare capabilities in Australia, Brazil, Canada, North Korea, Estonia, Czech Republic, France, Germany, India, Iran, Israel, Italy, Kenya, NATO, China, Pakistan, etc. - see Carr, Jeffrey, op.cit., pp. 243 - 262. An example of a political attack is during the 2009 Nigerian elections to control election information.\nJournal of Law and Public Administration Volume VIII, Issue 15, 2022 e) for recognizing and imposing a supremacy between cyber hackers, taking advantage of the context of kinetic conflict. For example, during the 2006-2008 Gaza war (eg Team Evil, Cold Zero, - formats for resistance to the Gaza war).\nThis notoriety can also occur through the acquisition of cyber attacks during major social crises or key moments in society (eg presidential elections, change of political regime). Among those known, Team Hell - a group of hackers with political or religious orientations, Agd_Scorp, Jurm Team, C-H Team, Gaza Hacker Team, DNS Team, DZ Team, etc. were mentioned in the literature¹⁵.\nf) to transmit signals of the cyber capacity of a state, to other states in conflict or competition (eg in 2009, on the day of the USA were attacked several strategic sites, of some government institutions and of some private companies - which carries out contracts with the state on military projects, in this sense being suspected North Korea).\ng) the insertion of sophisticated viruses in the target computers, for the exploitation of resources or the search for classified information, and if the compromised computer system is part of a larger network, the attacker obtains access to the main network; it takes advantage of the fact that antivirus technology simply cannot keep pace with known threats, much less those they are unaware of¹⁶.\nIn the case of armed (kinetic) conflicts, the targets of interest (cyber bullets) include hubs and other crucial links in the system that move enemy troops involved in the war, such as ports, airports, means of transport, battlefield facilities and communications. Targets could include computer systems located in the enemy state or abroad, command and control nodes, spatial information, surveillance, and means of recognition and communication, command, control and information systems.\nOne such example is cyber attacks on tanks used in a pending military operation, in which a state may have a cyber weapon capable of harming its enemy's tanks. Tanks are equipped with computerized weapon systems in today's armies and could be susceptible to cyber attacks¹⁷. A single cyber weapon may be able to stop the controls of the electric motor or the tank, virtually eliminating it from combat. Another cyber weapon can attack the warhead reinforcement system or the targeting system for the same purpose. Both effects are considered cyber attacks.\nPredictably, cyber attacks will target telecommunications infrastructure (e.g., a virus designed to shut off power to military installations), transportation infrastructure, secure networks, the economy, energy (generating blackouts), security breaches, and disabling security breaches. programs to protect the targeted systems, sometimes leaving graffiti behind in the attacked sites (containing information about certain exposed individuals) or on the main page, the online banking payment systems.\nAs a way of action, hack tek strategies are developed by organized crime in cyber underground labs and usually start by attacking individual servers or computers by infecting with Trojan viruses, such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)¹⁸ and SQL Injection.\nThe more advanced the technology, the more attacks appeared in forms not previously covered by official statements and state practices.\nCyber attacks come in many different forms, their destructive potential being limited only by the creativity and skill of the attackers behind them, and usually a kinetic attack is combined with a support cyber attack. Although it may seem intuitive that cyberattacks may constitute armed attacks, especially in light of their indirect ability to injure or kill, the legal ¹⁵ For details on the profile of these groups of hackers and their guidelines, see Carr, Jeffrey, op.cit., pp. 22-27.\n¹⁶ Often, the selection of the target is given two main considerations: the value of the information that will be obtained and the difficulty of success in operation (to exclude the probability of detection).\n¹⁷ The same goes for intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). ICBM launchers are developed within the limits of state secrecy and can essentially hit anywhere in the world in the execution of an attack. Although countermeasures capable of intercepting ICBMs have been developed, some states, such as Russia and North Korea, have recently announced that they have developed models that cannot be intercepted at this time (eg Sarmat / Satan 2, in the case of Russia).\n¹⁸ DDoS attacks typically disrupt communications and computing capabilities by sending huge amounts of (sometimes malformed) traffic to devices to alter or deny their ability to function as originally intended. They are common on the Internet because they are relatively unsophisticated and can be targeted from an Internet presence point in the cyberspace of one state against one in another enemy state.\nJournal of Law and Public Administration Volume VIII, Issue 15, 2022 community has been reluctant to take this approach, as cyberattacks do not resemble traditional armed attacks with conventional weapons, having another specific manifestation¹⁹.\nThe exploitation of computer systems in cyber warfare is, in fact, an exploitation of the human errors of those who thought and built them into their elements - ways of exploiting, reconfiguring or overwriting computer programs (eg, a virtual gateway which uses facial recognition is altered, nullifying the image component, or a cyber attack that corrupts the hard disks of the surveillance cameras where their recordings are stored, or the steering systems of some devices engaged in kinetic warfare).\n\n---\n\n## ## V.

The risk is real and it can already be seen empirically that in the case of recent armed conflicts (for example, the Russia-Ukraine conflict that began on February 24, 2022), the cyber component is not only used consistently, but is and targeted by attacks of the same nature by combatants.\n\nIt is important to note that, while the term \"cyber attack\" is often used in the literature, to date, all but a few effects of offensive cyber operations have remained below the level considered to be the use of force or armed attack, within the meaning of the provisions of the United Nations Charter. Moreover, malicious cyber activity can take place over an extended period of time - months, if not years - and is often not detected. For this reason, such activity is therefore better described as \"cyber operations\" than as \"attack.\"1.\n\nIn the military and international law, there are heated discussions about possible situations in which cyber attacks can be qualified as acts of war in themselves, especially when they take place during actual armed attacks. However, it is true that the increasing emergence of cyber attacks and the introduction of new technologies in the military and electronics industry have led to a fundamental change in the features that previously characterized acts of pure kinetic warfare, so it may seem necessary to adapt the law of war and international humanitarian law. which must evolve just as fast2.",

Specific and content\n\nIn order to keep the internet safe and peaceful, it is vital to establish the constitutive content of cyber attacks, the manner of manifestation and the targets primarily targeted, so that they can be recognized when they occur or, ideally, in time.\n\nIdentifying the real actors behind a cyber attack is a notoriously difficult task, which increases exponentially in the event of an armed conflict. Attributing attacks to individual actors (states or international organizations, or private actors) is traditionally seen as an acid test to determine whether an attack is assessed as an act of cyber warfare that complements kinetic warfare, or just an act. conjunctural of cyber terrorism (\"cyber hooliganism\").\n\nCyber attribution is the act of tying together cyber activities in such an aggression, based on their attributes, to determine if they come from the same actor, the most difficult part being determining the motivation of the latter³. The logical attribution process consists of 4 steps: a) Discovering the indicators of compromise of the attacked systems - by administering evidence of unauthorized activity in a network or organization, b) Associating them together as belonging to specific actors based on their attributes, c) Precise identification of the actor, d) determination of the actor's motivation⁴.\n\nThe assignment process can target a particular unit, organization, or even individual behind the cyber activity. The award process is particularly important in this situation, in which, without identity and motivation, it is not possible to know who the enemy is and, implicitly, how to be annihilated with an active or passive response, tactical or technical, from the victim state⁵.\n\nUnlike weapons of mass destruction, cyber attacks are \"weapons of mass iritation\"⁶ and can cause a \"computer pandemic,\" and in the event of an armed conflict, they are non-physical in nature.\n\nCyber attacks are generally non-public and usually target government or private institutions, usually major financial institutions affecting public confidence in Internet-mediated transactions, severely disrupting their critical infrastructure and security architecture⁷.\n\nAmong the most publicized in recent years are cyber attacks in the 2008 Russia-Georgia conflict⁸, cyber attacks on Estonia in 2007 (the most important recent cyber war, which was led by a group of young pro-Kremlin⁹), the military operation of Russia in Chechnya, which have shown that computer systems are an important component of future wars, so concrete legislative measures are needed to limit and eliminate attacks in this area.\n\nDuring an armed conflict, the cybernetic component unequivocally plays a key role, disrupting the electronic communication systems of combat units; it is a quasi-official part of the military war strategies developed by states.\n\nJens David; Govern, Kevin; Finkelstein, Claire (2015), Cyberwar.

Mapping the cyberunderworld, Sebastopol, California: O'Reilly Media Inc., p. 8.\n\n⁷ Covert cyber actions can be of two general types: (1) propaganda and misinformation that would be the subject of psychological operations to manipulate the evolution of the real armed conflict; and, (2) actions to shut down the computer networks of the target countries\n\n⁸ On the cyber side of the war in Georgia, coordinated by www.stopGeorgia.info (located in Germany) and www.stopGeorgia.ru (located in the USA), see, José Rios, Maria; Tenreiro de Magalhães, Sérgio; Santos, Leonel, The Georgia's cyberwar, available at www.researchgate.net. The attacks consisted mainly of SQL Injection and DDoS actions.\n\n⁹ The immediate cause of the cyber attacks on Estonia was the Estonian government's decision to move a war memorial of the Soviet Army from central Tallinn, the capital of Estonia. Many Estonians see the memorial as a harsh reminder of the former Soviet Union's \"occupation\" of Estonia, while many Russians see the statue as a memorial to the Red Army's sacrifices in liberating Estonia from Nazi Germany.",
    "Journal of Law and Public Administration\n\nVolume VIII, Issue 15, 2022\n\nThere are multi-national private hackers (nonstate hackers or patriotic hackers) secretly hired by states to move the real origin and responsibility for plausible deniability, while they enjoy the results of the attackers and support them. these by providing the necessary resources¹⁰.\n\nThus, in times of armed conflict or political tension between states, some members of a state's citizens may be motivated to support the country's war or political effort by taking direct action on the cyber component of the enemy involved in the conflict. Hackers (\"patriotic hackers\") are private citizens qualified in cyber attack capabilities, who can initiate a cyber attack against another state on their own. They may do so without the consent, direction or control of the State to which they belong or in whose territory they are located¹¹. However, there have been incidents in which it is suspected that hacktivists were encouraged and aided by the state, being used as proxies (eg the 2007 cyber attack on Estonia, attributed by the West to Russia)¹².\n\nRegardless of the origin of the perpetrator, cyber attacks in the context of an armed conflict can have the following objectives:\n\na) Exposing current realities (eg in 2008 in the context of the Israeli-led war against Palestine, Israeli hackers penetrated Palestinian TV and radio stations, inserting scenes with the death of Palestinian leaders).\n\nb) Implement malicious attack programs on unmanned military drones (eg Conficker C virus) frequently used in armed conflict, compared to the reality that military units understand the strategic and tactical need for unmanned aerial systems (UAS), making them an integral part of their arsenal of monitoring or even attacking the enemy¹³.\n\nb) The paralysis of the targeted websites for certain periods of time and the blocking of the normal activity of some critical institutions of the state, with indirect consequences on the public services, including of some smaller businesses / firms; attackers can change the language used by the attacked sites or the IP address (eg in the 2008 Gaza war - the \"cast lead\" operation), or post messages against the war or with the dead violence.\n\nc) indirectly causing material damage to the institutions or legal or even natural persons concerned - even by restricting regular access to the Internet, by attacks on governmental (political¹⁴) or commercial sites, or by silencing political opponents.\n\nFor example, in the 2009 elections in Iran, when the government decided to shut down the internet in the country in order to stop the massive protests of election fraud, carried out through Facebook and Twitter, in a context in which hackers from opposition parties would have launched DDoS attacks on government sites.\n\nd) collecting relevant data sought by penetrating networks, including by creating fictitious pages (phishing) or fictitious groups on social networks - communication (eg, Facebook, Telegram) to influence the mood of the population concerned.\n\nThe purpose is to shape and control public opinion about how events actually unfolded by DDoS, SQL Injection, or Crosssite scripting (XSS) attacks on government sites (Government, Banks, Parliament, Ministries, Lines). communication, embassy websites)\n\n¹⁰ We emphasize that international law presupposes that armed conflict is initiated only by states (as subjects of law) and not by groups or individuals.\n\n¹¹ Demonstrating a link between non-state actors, hacktivists and the beneficiary government can be difficult, sometimes impossible or takes too long to confirm that the competent legal authority of the target state can take swift response.\n\n¹² As we will see in the section on the attribution and imputability of cyber attacks, according to international law, if patriotic hackers carry out a cyber attack against another state that rises to the level of an \"armed attack\", the victim state has the legal right, acting inself-defense, to use force against those hackers.\n\n¹³ From missiles armed with missiles or bombs to so-called traditional ammunition drones (also known as kamikaze drones), this unmanned technology completes many new challenges and opens up a whole new set of possibilities for armed forces around the world.\n\n¹⁴ Politically motivated cyber attacks range in sophistication, from small-scale denial of simple attacks to well-organized and covert espionage attacks. The sophistication of a cyber attack depends on the skill of the attackers and the amount of reconnaissance performed before the attack. For considerations regarding cyber warfare capabilities in Australia, Brazil, Canada, North Korea, Estonia, Czech Republic, France, Germany, India, Iran, Israel, Italy, Kenya, NATO, China, Pakistan, etc. - see Carr, Jeffrey, op.cit., pp. 243 - 262. An example of a political attack is during the 2009 Nigerian elections to control election information.",

For example, during the 2006-2008 Gaza war (eg Team Evil, Cold Zero, - formats for resistance to the Gaza war).\n\nThis notoriety can also occur through the acquisition of cyber attacks during major social crises or key moments in society (eg presidential elections, change of political regime). Among those known, Team Hell - a group of hackers with political or religious orientations, Agd_Scorp, Jurm Team, C-H Team, Gaza Hacker Team, DNS Team, DZ Team, etc. were mentioned in the literature¹⁵.\n\nf) to transmit signals of the cyber capacity of a state, to other states in conflict or competition (eg in 2009, on the day of the USA were attacked several strategic sites, of some government institutions and of some private companies - which carries out contracts with the state on military projects, in this sense being suspected North Korea).\n\ng) the insertion of sophisticated viruses in the target computers, for the exploitation of resources or the search for classified information, and if the compromised computer system is part of a larger network, the attacker obtains access to the main network; it takes advantage of the fact that antivirus technology simply cannot keep pace with known threats, much less those they are unaware of¹⁶.\n\nIn the case of armed (kinetic) conflicts, the targets of interest (cyber bullets) include hubs and other crucial links in the system that move enemy troops involved in the war, such as ports, airports, means of transport, battlefield facilities and communications. Targets could include computer systems located in the enemy state or abroad, command and control nodes, spatial information, surveillance, and means of recognition and communication, command, control and information systems.\n\nOne such example is cyber attacks on tanks used in a pending military operation, in which a state may have a cyber weapon capable of harming its enemy's tanks. Tanks are equipped with computerized weapon systems in today's armies and could be susceptible to cyber attacks¹⁷. A single cyber weapon may be able to stop the controls of the electric motor or the tank, virtually eliminating it from combat. Another cyber weapon can attack the warhead reinforcement system or the targeting system for the same purpose. Both effects are considered cyber attacks.\n\nPredictably, cyber attacks will target telecommunications infrastructure (e.g., a virus designed to shut off power to military installations), transportation infrastructure, secure networks, the economy, energy (generating blackouts), security breaches, and disabling security breaches. programs to protect the targeted systems, sometimes leaving graffiti behind in the attacked sites (containing information about certain exposed individuals) or on the main page, the online banking payment systems.\n\nAs a way of action, hack tek strategies are developed by organized crime in cyber underground labs and usually start by attacking individual servers or computers by infecting with Trojan viruses, such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)¹⁸ and SQL Injection.\n\nThe more advanced the technology, the more attacks appeared in forms not previously covered by official statements and state practices.\n\nCyber attacks come in many different forms, their destructive potential being limited only by the creativity and skill of the attackers behind them, and usually a kinetic attack is combined with a support cyber attack. Although it may seem intuitive that cyberattacks may constitute armed attacks, especially in light of their indirect ability to injure or kill, the legal\n\n¹⁵ For details on the profile of these groups of hackers and their guidelines, see Carr, Jeffrey, op.cit., pp. 22-27.\n\n¹⁶ Often, the selection of the target is given two main considerations: the value of the information that will be obtained and the difficulty of success in operation (to exclude the probability of detection).\n\n¹⁷ The same goes for intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). ICBM launchers are developed within the limits of state secrecy and can essentially hit anywhere in the world in the execution of an attack. Although countermeasures capable of intercepting ICBMs have been developed, some states, such as Russia and North Korea, have recently announced that they have developed models that cannot be intercepted at this time (eg Sarmat / Satan 2, in the case of Russia).\n\n¹⁸ DDoS attacks typically disrupt communications and computing capabilities by sending huge amounts of (sometimes malformed) traffic to devices to alter or deny their ability to function as originally intended. They are common on the Internet because they are relatively unsophisticated and can be targeted from an Internet presence point in the cyberspace of one state against one in another enemy state.",
    "Journal of Law and Public Administration\n\nVolume VIII, Issue 15, 2022\n\ncommunity has been reluctant to take this approach, as cyberattacks do not resemble traditional armed attacks with conventional weapons, having another specific manifestation¹⁹.\n\nThe exploitation of computer systems in cyber warfare is, in fact, an exploitation of the human errors of those who thought and built them into their elements - ways of exploiting, reconfiguring or overwriting computer programs (eg, a virtual gateway which uses facial recognition is altered, nullifying the image component, or a cyber attack that corrupts the hard disks of the surveillance cameras where their recordings are stored, or the steering systems of some devices engaged in kinetic warfare).\n\n## III. Establishing the responsibility of the state for cyber attacks carried out on its territory\n\nStates may not respond to a cross-border cyber attack by force without first establishing the State's responsibility for the attack. Although historically this has meant that an attack has taken place, to be attributed to a state or its agents, direct control of an attack is no longer a requirement of state responsibility. Today, international law is based on the responsibility of a state and only on the breach of its international obligations to prevent and combat it.\n\nThis change is particularly important for cyber attacks, as the prevailing view is that cross-border cyber attacks should be treated as a criminal matter rather than a national security issue, and this seems to be based on the historical view of state responsibility. This limited view of state responsibility blocks attacked states in the response crisis by requiring states to attribute cyber attacks to a state or its agents before responding through active defenses, even if the likelihood of successfully assigning a ranged attack is generally uncertain. Consequently, states in crisis in response to a cyber attack act under the false assumption that they must decide between effective but illegal active defenses and the less effective but legal path of passive defenses and the scope of domestic criminal law.\n\nGiven the perspective of state responsibility, states should first determine whether the cyber attack can be blamed on the home state. Once a cyber attack is blamed on a state and that state refuses to comply with its international obligations, the legal barriers to self-defense action disappear.\n\nWith regard to cyber attacks, the accepted principles of common *jus ad bellum* still support the imputation of state responsibility for armed attacks by non-state actors when the attacks come from a state that allows non-state actors to carry out criminal operations within their borders. States that allow non-state actors to carry out these operations are in breach of their duty to prevent attacks on other states and are known as \"sanctuary states\". This is extremely important for cyber-attack states because when a cyber-attack comes from a sanctuary state, a victim-state can use active defenses and avoid crisis response.\n\nTherefore, we need to understand the answers to two key questions:\n\n- What does a state's duty to prevent cyber attacks mean?\n\nThis obligation in fact includes several smaller tasks to prevent cyber attacks, including the adoption of strict criminal laws, the vigorous enforcement of investigative procedures, the prosecution of attackers and, during the investigation and prosecution, cooperation with cyber-attack states. These are the duties of all states and are binding as customary international law. The authority for these duties comes from all three sources of international tradition in the field of law - international conventions, international customs and general principles of law common to civilized nations, as evidenced by the judgments and teachings of the most qualified international lawyers.\n\nThe only international treaty analogous to cybernetics is the European Convention on Cybercrime in 2001²⁰. Although the treaty is only a regional agreement, it is still very influential on customary international law because of the importance of the states that have ratified it, originating from the doctrine of the states particularly affected.\n\n---\n\n¹⁹Unlike conventional warfare, an autonomous and exclusive act of warfare in the cyber realm is difficult to conceive.\n\n²⁰Available at www.eur-lex.europa.eu.The Cybercrime Convention requires its parties to establish \"criminal\" offences for almost every conceivable type of cyber attack, in accordance with their domestic law.",
    "Journal of Law and Public Administration\n\nVolume VIII, Issue 15, 2022\n\nIn addition, it demonstrates the recognition by states of both the need to criminalize cyber attacks and the obligation of states to prevent their territory from being used by non-state actors to conduct cyber attacks against other states. The convention is also significant because it recognizes that cyber attacks cannot be banned during an attack, and the only way to prevent them is through aggressive law enforcement, coupled with state cooperation.\n\nInternational Terrorist Terrorism Treaties provide additional, albeit indirect, support for the duty to prevent cyber attacks. The international community recognizes terrorism as a threat to international peace and security, but no agreement has been reached on a definition. As a result, states have increasingly taken the approach of outlawing certain acts of terrorism - terrorists are constantly developing new methods of attack, rather than outlawing terrorism itself.\n\nThese treaties impose on states several common requirements regarding terrorist attacks, such as taking all practicable measures to prevent such attacks, criminalizing attacks, referring cases to the competent authorities for prosecution, and obliging states to cooperate with each other during criminal proceedings[21]. Although these treaties do not address cyber attacks, the principles contained therein contribute to influencing state requirements under customary international law on terrorism. As there is growing evidence that cyberattacks will soon be an active weapon for terrorists, states should refer to the common principles found in these treaties as opinio juris when cyberattacks are used as a terrorist weapon.\n\n- What must a state do to avoid violating its duty to prevent?\n\nThe treatment of cyber attacks in accordance with their criminal law also proves the recognition of the duty of states to prevent cyber attacks. Many states criminalize such acts and prosecute cyber attacks to discourage attackers from committing law enforcement, which seems to be the only way to protect and prevent damage to their computer systems.\n\nThis gives credibility to the notion that, unlike a conventional attack, which can be stopped after detection, cyber attacks can only be stopped by setting ex ante barriers that attackers are trying to cross. Moreover, these practices demonstrate a growing acceptance among states that cyber attacks must be stopped and that the way to do this is to enforce the law[22].\n\nStates' responses to transnational terrorist attacks further support the recognition of a duty to prevent cyber attacks under customary international law. This involves the difficult task of analyzing data and clues about the existence and extent of such attacks[23].\n\nThe more cyber attacks resemble terrorism, the easier it will be to fit into the paradigm built to deal with transnational terrorism. However, regardless of their purpose, cyber attacks pose a threat to international peace and security and should be treated as a category of other recognized transnational threats.\n\nThe general principles of law common to civilized nations also support the recognition of the duty to prevent cyber attacks. It is a well-established principle in the domestic law of most states that individuals should be held liable for acts or omissions that have a causal link to the harm suffered by another person. While international law is not bound by the domestic laws of states, international law can be derived from the general principles common to the great legal systems of the world. Most states use causality as a principle for establishing individual responsibility, giving credibility to the idea that the responsibility of a state should also be based on causation[24].\n\nCyber attacks are extremely difficult for states to detect before committing a particular attack, and are often committed by individuals or groups who are not even on a state's radar. However, just because cyberattacks are difficult\n\n21Cyberspace, as a global electronic medium, cannot be dominated or controlled by a single nation.\n\n22Carr, Jeffrey, op. cit., p. 64.\n\n23For details on this issue and the analysis techniques that could be used, see Petersson, Gustav Jakob; Breul, Jonathan D. (2017), Cyber Society, Big Data, andxs Evaluation, Comparative Policy Evaluation, Volume 24 (colective papers), USA, pp. 47-75.\n\n24States's responsibility for negligence in taking all reasonable measures to prevent crime and to prosecute, prosecute and bring to justice transnational cybercriminals has also been recognized in international justice, such as the International Court of Justice. See, in this regard, Carr, Jeffrey, op.cit., p. 67.",
    "Journal of Law and Public Administration\n\nVolume VIII, Issue 15, 2022\n\nto prevent does not mean that states can breach their duty to prevent them, and by enforcing the law vigorously, they will deter cyberattacks. States that do not enact such laws do not fulfill their duty to prevent cyberattacks²⁵.\n\nA state's passivity and indifference to cyber attacks make it a sanctuary state, from which attackers can operate safely. When viewed in this light, it becomes clear that a state can be held indirectly responsible for cyber attacks in accordance with the established principles of customary international law.\n\nHost states will be judged on their efforts to catch and prosecute cyber-attackers, which is likely to be the main way in which states can deter and prevent future attacks. When victim states end up judging whether a host state has complied with its international obligations, the host states must cooperate with the former to ensure their transparency and good faith.\n\nOnce a host state proves that it is a sanctuary state by its inaction, the other states can blame it for cyber attacks originating in its territory. At that point, the host state becomes responsible for the cyber attack that triggered the initial investigation, as well as for all future cyber attacks that come from its borders. This opens the door for a victim state to use active defenses against the servers of the computers involved during a cyber attack.\n\nWhen attacks are carried out, most often by non-state actors, across state borders, attracting international responsibility (usually indirect), in this case, begins with an analysis of whether the armed attacks of non-state actors fall under the law of war continues with the duties that states have towards each other with regard to non-state actors on their territory²⁶, then moves on to ways of imputing state responsibility for the acts of non-state actors and ends with the legality of cross-border response operations against states²⁷.\n\nThus, a state's passivity or indifference to a non-state agent on its own territory could trigger its liability, possibly to the same extent, as if it had actively participated in the planning, an involvement that can be established by an analysis. post facto whether the state could have put more effort into preventing the cyber attack.\n\nBased on the above, it is clear that victim states can respond by force to armed attacks by non-state actors located in another state when host states violate their duty to prevent such attacks. If supplemented by cyber attacks, imputing state responsibility in this way gives states a legal way to use active defenses without the need to separately assign an attack to the state or its agents. In fact, imputation of liability is the equivalent of attributing the attack to the state or its agents.\n\nTherefore, in this case, it is essential to establish and explain why cyberattacks are armed attacks, which is the duty of a state to prevent cyberattacks, and the means and circumstances that would allow a victim state to respond by force to a cyber attack.\n\nMoreover, the attribution requirement perpetuates the \"response crisis\" because it is virtually impossible to attribute cyber attacks during the attack. Although states can track cyberattacks retroactively to the servers of computers in another state, conclusively establishing the identity of the attacker requires intensive investigation, which requires time and the help of the home state.\n\nGiven the ban on forcibly responding until an attack has been attributed to a state or its agents, coupled with the fact that the vast majority of cyber attacks are conducted by non-state actors, it should come as no surprise that states are reluctant to deal with cyber attacks as acts of war, thus risking violations of international law. This \"assignment issue\" blocks states in response²⁸.\n\n²⁵ Carr, Jeffrey, op.cit., p. 67.\n\n²⁶ It is a long-established principle of international law that a state is obliged to use diligence to prevent the commission of criminal acts against another nation or its people. Recognized in several international acts, the principle implies that a state cannot knowingly allow its territory to be used for actions contrary to the rights of other states. Of course, there is no absolute obligation on the host state to prevent all cyber attacks on its territory, but when a host state has the capacity to prevent an armed attack by non-state actors on its territory, it fails to do so. This violates its duty of prevention under international law.\n\n²⁷ For details on these stages, see Carr, Jeffrey, op.cit., p. 53 et seq.\n\n²⁸ For a graphic evolution, see Carr, Jeffrey, op.cit., p. 47.",
    "Journal of Law and Public Administration\n\nVolume VIII, Issue 15, 2022\n\nEarly detection and warning programs can help capture cyber attacks before they reach their climax, but even the best programs are not able to detect all cyber attacks.\n\nWhen an ongoing cyber attack has already caused a serious, immediate, invasive, direct, and measurable damage, it can be safely classified as an armed attack, even if it is still ongoing. On the other hand, when an attack did not cause such damage, the system administrator will have to consider: (1) a possible immediate future injury, (2) the likelihood of avoiding the attack with purely defensive measures, respectively (3) whether the attack should be classified as an imminent armed attack.\n\nAfter all, the state can avoid being the target of active defenses²⁹ from another state, even when the attacks come from its territory, by taking concrete measures to prevent cyber attacks, such as the implementation of cyber attacks. Of the legal framework on crime, the application of these laws and cooperation with victim states to bring the attackers to justice. In this endeavor, the human element, with all its strengths and weaknesses, is paramount.\n\nStates that violate their duty to prevent cyber attacks and refuse to change their practices should be held accountable - at least indirectly - for all subsequent attacks that come from within their borders, in accordance with the law of war. At a time when cyber attacks are threatening global security and states are struggling to find ways to improve their cyber defenses, there is no reason to protect sanctuary states from the legal use of active defenses by victim states, and there is every reason to increase the state's defense against cyber attacks.\n\nIn other words, states not only enjoy rights, but must also fulfill certain obligations under international law, among which the idea of \"due diligence\" occupies a central place - a state is obliged to use diligence to prevent the commission within the limits its criminal acts against other nations³⁰. This duty of states is continuous, compared to the need to protect other states against harmful acts of individuals - state or non-state actors, individuals or legal entities - launched from within their own jurisdictions (called \"sanctuary states\").\n\nIn this new age of cyber warfare, the Web is both a battlefield and an information space. Social services such as Twitter, Facebook, MySpace or LiveJournal are an essential part of the hacker's toolkit. Commonly known as the Social Web, these services provide an unprecedented repository of personal data, personal information about people, companies and governments, which can be used for financial crime, espionage and misinformation, both by state hackers and by non-state actors.\n\n## IV. Cyber espionage – an adjacent weapon in cyber warfare?\n\nCyber warfare - sometimes called \"bloodless war\" - is closely linked to cybercrime, cyber security, cyber terrorism, cyber espionage, cyberspace, the differentiation between these concepts being sensitive because they are largely intertwined. The armies of the world are struggling to cope with a new field of cyber battle, by delimiting and framing their actions in the sphere of practical applicability of these concepts.\n\nIt is often impossible to determine whether attempts to hack a computer in another state were acts of cyber warfare or cyber intelligence gathering. Unlike cyber attack activity, the collection of information is not always based on cyber exploitation as a facilitator³¹.\n\n²⁹ Active defense is the most appropriate type of force to use against cyber attacks in light of jus in bello principles. First of all, in terms of military necessity, active defense is probably the full force needed to carry out the mission of defending against a cyber attack. Active defense can track down an attack at the source and immediately annihilate it, while kinetic weapons will be slower and less effective than the speed of a hack-back. Therefore, the use of kinetic weapons to the detriment of active defense will not only be less effective, but will also violate the principle of necessity by employing force only for the sake of destruction. In addition, the choice between active defense versus kinetic weapons should reduce the possibility of escalating these situations on a large scale in armed conflicts between states.\n\n³⁰ Maurer, Tim (2018). Cyber mercenaries, The State, Hackers and Power, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, p. 130. The author refers to the jurisprudence of the International Court of Justice which stated that \"it is the obligation of each state not to knowingly allow the territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other states.\"\n\n³¹ For methods of collecting information in the virtual environment, see Oakley, Jacob G, op.cit., pp. 96 - 97. And for the relationship between cyber intelligence gathering, cyber reconnaissance and cyber attacks, broadly, op.cit., pp. 102-108.",
    "Journal of Law and Public Administration\n\nVolume VIII, Issue 15, 2022\n\nIn international law, cyberespionage has been defined as \"the practice of spying or using spies to obtain information about the plans and activities of a foreign government or a competing company\"³².\n\nAnother interesting thing about espionage is that it is not always sponsored or initiated by the enemy state. In fact, in many cases of espionage around the world, the person who collects information and transmits it to foreign powers has done so of his own free will, sometimes out of revenge and sometimes for reasons of financial compensation, or for other philosophical and ethical reasons.\n\nCyberespionage may seem similar, but it is different from a motivational point of view, with cyber manipulation activities. Manipulation, as a form of cyber attack, consists of controlling or modifying information, information systems and / or networks in cyberspace to create physical effects of denial, using deception, bait, conditioning, forgery, and other similar techniques. Use your opponent's information resources for the purpose of apparent friendship, to create clues that do not appear immediately in cyberspace. The targeted network may appear to be operating normally until side or tertiary effects occur, including proven physical effects of the attack³³.\n\n## V. Conclusions\n\nNo change in technology so far, however, seems to rival the potential for transformation as much as the development of offensive cyber capabilities. Indeed, this is demonstrated by the invention of a new label for the notion of war involving cyber attacks, namely \"cyber warfare\", as if it were not just a new type of weapon, but a whole new kind of war.\n\nIn the circumstances of the armed / classical war, the growing importance of both military and personal data or otherwise protected by law is obvious. In an age when individuals voluntarily understand how to transmit, store, and receive large amounts of personal data over the Internet, planting software in electronic devices to erase, modify, or approximate data is becoming a crucial new tactic of war: a \"fifth dimension battlefield\", as it is often said in doctrine, after air, sea, earth and outer space³⁴.\n\nThis change in staff has led to the merger of military and corporate espionage functions, and as a result, the militarization of cyberspace has created legal and moral ambiguity regarding privacy rights, as well as a personal responsibility to be targeted in cyberspace. virtue of the simple position it occupies in relation to an information network.\n\nThese tendencies contributed to the change in the structure of the war, with the result that the line distinction between the military and the civilian field blurred. Cyber warfare operations thus occupy a crucial position in the changing landscape of military conflict and require prompt response from the victim states, provided that the proportionality and correct identification of attackers and the international legal framework are respected.\n\nProportionality must be encouraged, for example, because it is a crucial issue in military ethics as well as in common criminal law. It requires that no more force be used than is necessary to repel an attack or to fulfill other legitimate objectives. But how do you determine what constitutes a necessary response to a cyber attack? More importantly, how should we determine if it is ever proportionate to launch an offensive cyber warfare counterattack? There are open-ended questions raised in the relevant literature, to which the practice is to be answered, being undoubtedly that the legitimate collective defense requires a more precise and responsible action against the dangers arising with the evolution of technology and its malicious use for which run counter to individual or collective safety.\n\n## References\n\n³² Oakley, Jacob G.

    "abstract": "Due to their worrying presence, cyber attacks pose new challenges to states, both nationally and between states, and are almost non-existent during recent military conflicts. Global peace requires at the legal and practical level a firm reaction against their use, but with the observance of rules and limits of the intensity of the force used, including the real need and proportionality. The study seeks to establish some guidelines under the mentioned aspects, far from being widely accepted in current legal and political doctrines, and can be a starting point in developing a predictable legislative framework effective, effective in action and decisive in preserving the real sense of security individual and collective. Keywords: cyber attacks; war; armed conflict; responsibility; state.",
