The UN Charter system admits only two exceptions to the prohibition on the use of force: collective measures authorised by the Security Council acting under Chapter VII of the Charter; or the inherent right of collective or individual self-defence provided for in Article 51.\n\nThe exact scope of the right of self-defence remains one of the divisive issues in international law, so it is not surprising that its application to the topic of computer network attacks is particularly complex. First, it is difficult to identify the point at which a computer network attack will rise to the level of an 'armed attack', the threshold that triggers a state's right to self-defence. As seen in the previous chapter, traditional international law focuses on personal injury, fatality and damage to physical property as measures of the seriousness of an attack. This approach is favoured by most commentators writing on the subject to date;¹ however, many catastrophically damaging computer network attacks will not cause any of these deleterious consequences. Further, it is likely that many attacks using computer network operations will not come as a single instance, but rather as a series of events which, taken separately, may not be sufficient to qualify as an armed attack. This raises the issue of the right to respond to 'pin-prick' attacks with a single use of force, a concept which has had a chequered history in international law. The likelihood that computer network attacks will\n\n¹ See Horace B. Robertson, 'Self-Defense against Computer Network Attack under International Law' in M. N. Schmitt and B. T.

For example, will intrusion into an air defence network be sufficient evidence of an imminent attack following the 2007 Israeli raid on the alleged Syrian nuclear site.\n\nThe second major difficulty with computer network attacks, as opposed to traditional kinetic attacks, is the difficulty of attributing an attack to its original perpetrator. The length of time required to trace an attack makes questions of the necessity of force to repel a computer network attack difficult to satisfy. Questions of proportionality also arise in determining whether it would ever be proportionate to use armed force in response to a computer network attack. This chapter examines these questions in light of current international law, the definition of armed attack and considers in what circumstances force may be used in self-defence against a computer network attack.\n\nThe final sections address the authorisation to use force under the auspices of Chapter VII Security Council resolutions, and what measures might be taken by states in response to computer network attacks which fail to meet the threshold for lawful self-defence.\n\n# 1. Armed attack\n\nThe right of self-defence is a customary law right, inherent in the sovereignty of states; it has been codified for the most part by Article 51 of the UN Charter as follows:\n\nNothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security. Measures taken by Members in the exercise of this right of self-defence shall be immediately reported to the Security Council and shall not in any way affect the authority and responsibility of the Security Council under the present Charter to take at any time such action as it deems necessary in order to maintain or restore international peace and security.\n\nThe customary status of the right has been confirmed by the Nicaragua (Merits) case.² Article 51 of the Charter allows self-defence in response to an 'armed attack' and the International Court of Justice has\n\n² Nicaragua (Merits), para. 176.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press",

Further, the historical predecessors to the Charter system do not offer any interpretive assistance. Neither the Kellogg-Briand Pact nor the Covenant of the League of Nations refer to the term. Both formulate self-defence as a response to aggression; hence all attempts at definition were focused on that term.⁵ The drafting history of the Charter provides evidence that discussions took place on the difference between an attack and an armed attack (based on the fact that the United States draft of 11 May 1945 contained both terms) and although no definitive conclusion was reached, the term was replaced by armed attack only.⁶ Professor Ian Brownlie has pointed out that it is likely that the records of the San Francisco conference contain no definition of the phrase ‘armed attack’ because the term was considered ‘sufficiently clear’ and ‘self-evident’.⁷ That was certainly the case in the drafting of the North Atlantic Treaty around the same time, as evidenced by the comments of the Foreign Relations Committee of the United States Senate which noted that the phrase ‘armed attack’ in Article 5 ‘is ordinarily self evident’ and ‘there is rarely, if ever, any doubt as to whether it has occurred or by whom it was launched’.⁸ The decision of the International Court of Justice in the Nicaragua (Merits) case made clear that armed attacks form a subset of the term ‘force’ in Article 2(4); therefore those actions which have been discussed in the previous chapter as falling outside the ambit of the definition of armed force will subsequently also fail to meet the threshold of an armed attack.

The Court sees no reason to deny that, in customary law, the prohibition of armed attacks may apply to the sending by a State of armed bands to the territory of another State, if such an operation, because of its scale and effects, would have been classified as an armed attack rather than as a mere frontier incident had it been carried out by regular armed forces.\n\nThe Court goes on to consider that acts such as ‘assistance to rebels in the form of the provision of weapons or logistical or other support’ do not constitute an armed attack, but might nonetheless constitute a threat or use of force, or amount to intervention in the internal or external affairs of other states.¹¹ Despite being the subject of much criticism and discussion, the Court’s decision makes clear that under current international law the definition of ‘armed attack’ is dependent on the ‘scale and effects’ of an attack which must be of sufficient gravity to elevate such actions beyond ‘mere frontier incidents’.¹² The view that an armed attack must be of ‘relatively large scale and with substantial effect’ is reiterated by several leading scholars,¹³ and is in\n\n⁹ Nicaragua (Merits), para. 195. ¹⁰ Ibid.\n¹¹ Ibid., para. 195, 231.

However, the thresholds of each of these concepts, and the responses which each allows, are yet to be established with any certainty.\n\nThis uncertainty makes the classification of any computer network attack particularly difficult. As noted previously, the possible effects of computer network attacks 'span the spectrum of consequentiality',[21] thus making classification based on the type of computer network attack impossible; each attack must be assessed on its merits. It seems certain, however, that where a computer network attack causes destruction and fatalities on a par with a conventional attack, a state will have a right to respond in self-defence. This is the conclusion reached in a report by the Office of General Counsel of the US Department of Defense, which concluded:[22]\n\n[I]f a coordinated computer network attack shuts down a nation's air traffic control system along with its banking and financial systems and public utilities, and opens the floodgates of several dams resulting in general flooding that causes widespread civilian deaths and property damage, it may well be that no-one would challenge a victim nation if it concluded that it was the victim of an armed attack, or of an act equivalent to an armed attack.\n\nWhile undoubtedly correct, the report fails to separate and analyse the attack in its component parts, combining those components which directly cause death and destruction with less severe attacks. Schmitt focuses on the consequences of the attack rather than on the object of the attack or on the intentions of the attacker; the exception being where the intentions of the attacker are specifically to cause physical damage to tangible objects or injury to human beings, in which case Schmitt considers the resort to armed force is permitted.[23] He argues that self-defence should be limited to operations which are de facto armed attacks, or imminently preparatory thereto; the net result being a limitation on both sides to resort to computer network attack techniques which might threaten global stability and on individual responses which might themselves prove destabilising.[24]\n\n21 Schmitt, 'Normative Framework', 912.\n22 Office of General Counsel, An Assessment on International Legal Issues in Information Operations, United States Department of Defense (1999) www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/dod-io-legal/dod-io-legal.pdf (last accessed 5 July 2011).\n23 Schmitt, 'Normative Framework', 928.\n24 Ibid., 886.

A state is therefore permitted to respond in self-defence when it is the victim of a computer network attack causing damage to property or persons of sufficient scale and effect to elevate it beyond the equivalent of a frontier incident. The denial of service attacks against Estonia in 2007, disruptive as they were, did not reach this level; neither did the attacks launched the following year against Georgia, although the analysis of that incident is complicated by the subsequent conventional attacks by Russia.²⁷ No loss of life, physical injury or destruction of property was suffered as a result of the computer network operations launched against either state. In contrast, the 2010 Stuxnet worm has purportedly resulted in significant destruction of property. At the time of writing, reports indicate that the worm may be responsible for Iran having to replace 1,000 of the 9,000 IR-1 centrifuges at the Natanz nuclear fuel enrichment facility. While reports of the effect of the worm on the facility and the resulting impact on Iran’s nuclear programme have differed wildly, a report by the Institute for Science and International Security detailing the effect of Stuxnet has concluded that while the effects of the worm were significant, the effect on Iran’s nuclear programme was only moderate:²⁸\n\n²⁵ Sharp, Cyberspace and the Use of Force, 129.\n²⁶ Ibid., 101–2.\n²⁷ The question of the cyber attacks acting as an indication of imminent armed attacks is addressed in the following section on anticipatory self-defence.\n²⁸ David Albright, Paul Brannan and Christina Walrond, Stuxnet Malware and Natanz: Update of ISIS December 22, 2010 Report, Institute for Science and International Security (2011) 3.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press",

Anticipatory self-defence\n\nIt is likely that computer network attacks will be used in conjunction with, or as a prelude to, a traditional armed attack. Such attacks designed to 'prepare the battle space' can come in a myriad of forms, including the disablement of intelligence-gathering sensors such as satellites and radar posts via computer network attack, disruption of military communications networks leaving units isolated and unable to be scrambled, or, on the civilian level, disablement of emergency response networks may be launched in anticipation of more traditional kinetic action to follow. It is certainly clear that states are considering how a combination of electronic and traditional attacks might be used in the future. For example, the US actively looked for computer network solutions prior to the 2003 invasion of Iraq and China is openly looking for an 'assassin's mace' to address the perceived asymmetry of the Chinese military against the US in conventional conflicts, widely believed to incorporate computer network attacks.²⁹ As Robertson points out, in modern warfare the electronic battlefield will play a crucial role, and any steps that a prospective attacker can take to neutralise or destroy its enemy's command and control, intelligence, communications, or weapons-control networks prior to a traditional attack would gain an enormous advantage.³⁰ This advantage was seen in the 2007 Israeli attack on the suspected Syrian nuclear site where the air defence radar did not detect the attacking planes until they were disappearing back over the border.³¹ One might also look to the role of the distributed denial of service attacks against Georgia in 2008 which preceded the physical invasion by Russia.

Doctrinal debate and imminent attacks\n\nThere is no consensus in international legal doctrine over the point in time from which measures of self-defence against an armed attack may be taken.³² In particular, states and commentators are divided over whether a right of anticipatory self-defence exists in international law. The debate centres on whether anticipatory self-defence survived the implementation of Article 51 of the UN Charter, which states that nothing in the Charter ‘shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs’. Those arguing for a restrictive interpretation of the clause interpret this to mean that the right of self-defence is now only available to member states who are the object of an actual armed attack. Gray, Kelsen and Brownlie are some of the leading proponents of this view, which is based on the premise that the Charter forbids any use of force on the part of individual members except for the right of self-defence against an armed attack.³³\n\nThose arguing for a more expansive approach point out that Article 51 specifically reserves the ‘inherent right’ of self-defence, and the customary right includes the right to respond to an imminent armed attack.³⁴ Although ultimately disagreeing with the position, Bothe points out that many authors acknowledge that a threat may be so direct and overwhelming that it is just not feasible to require the victim to wait to act in self-defence until the act has actually started.³⁵ Other authors have addressed this problem by adopting a broader notion\n\n³² Randelzhofer, ‘Article 51’, 803.\n³³ Bowett, *Self-Defence*, 188.

For example, while expressly rejecting the notion of anticipatory self-defence, Yoram Dinstein nevertheless incorporates actions taken in advance of an actual attack by moving the timing of the beginning of the attack, a concept he calls ‘interceptive’ self-defence.³⁶ Dinstein argues that the beginning of an armed attack is not linked to the first shot but rather to the moment of irrevocable commitment to the attack. Once the die has been cast, the armed attack can be said to have commenced and the victim state need not ‘wait impotently for the inescapable blow’.³⁷ This concept has echoes in the ‘target locking’ arguments of some states in respect of modern precision-guided missiles. For example, the US argues that an armed attack begins when the radar guiding the missile is locked on and ready to fire, and the rules of engagement of their armed forces reflect this approach.³⁸ Although, as Lindsay Moir points out, whether such an approach truly distinguishes between an armed attack which has begun but not yet reached the target state, and an armed attack that has not begun but is imminent, is open to question.³⁹\n\nThe standard to be applied for taking action in anticipation of an attack was set out by US Secretary of State Daniel Webster in his letter regarding the Caroline incident of 1837. In his now classic formulation, he stated that the right of self-defence only arises where there is ‘a necessity of self-defence, instant, overwhelming, leaving no choice of means, and no moment for deliberation’.⁴⁰ Christopher Greenwood\n\n³⁶ Dinstein, War, Aggression, and Self-Defense, 187.\n³⁷ Dinstein, ‘CNA and Self-Defense’, 111.\n³⁸ Gray, Use of Force (2nd edn), 108, n. 48. For example, in 1998 US aircraft in the no-fly zone over Iraq fired at a missile battery when its radar had locked on to the planes patrolling the zone.

One of the British officers, Lieutenant McLeod, was later arrested in the United States on charges of murder arising out of the incident.

In response to these actions Israel launched strikes against Egypt's airbases, completely destroying the Egyptian air force.⁴⁷ Israel justified its actions in the Security Council by claiming that it had been attacked first, but also by reference to a series of acts of sabotage from Syria, and stressed both the character of the Egyptian blockade as an act of war and ‘perhaps more imminent than anything else, this vast and purposeful encirclement movement’ caused by the transfer of large numbers of Egyptian forces to their ‘very gates’.⁴⁸ Gray rejects this incident as evidence of an acceptance of anticipatory self-defence, stating that ‘whatever position is taken on the facts of the outbreak of the Six Day War, the point of importance here is that Israel did not claim to be acting in anticipatory self-defence’.⁴⁹ However, Franck notes that Israel’s ‘words and actions clearly asserted a right of anticipatory self-defence against an imminent armed attack’.⁵⁰ In emphasising the fact that neither the Security Council nor the General Assembly condemned Israel’s actions, Franck comments:⁵¹\n\nMost states, on the basis of the evidence available to them, did however conclude that such an armed attack was imminent, that Israel had reasonably surmised that it stood a better chance of survival if the attack were pre-empted, and that, therefore, in the circumstances, it had not acted unreasonably. This does not amount to an open-ended endorsement of a general right to anticipatory self-defense, but it does recognize that, in demonstrable circumstances of extreme necessity, anticipatory self-defense may be a legitimate exercise of a State’s right to ensure its survival.\n\nThis accords with the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice in the Nuclear Weapons case, which indirectly commented on the situation when the majority of judges were unable to conclude that the first use of nuclear weapons would invariably be unlawful if the very existence of the state were threatened.⁵²\n\n⁴⁷ For a full exposition of the facts of this incident see generally A.

In most cases the reaction was based on a conclusion that Israel had failed to demonstrate that there was an imminent threat from Iraq and had thus failed to satisfy the Caroline requirements for anticipatory self-defence rather than a general dismissal of a right of anticipatory self-defence.54 As Greenwood points out, the emphasis on this failure to demonstrate the existence of the imminent threat tends, if anything, to confirm the existence of a right of self-defence in cases where such an imminent threat was shown to exist.55 He goes on to cite Rosalyn Higgins, who notes:56\n\n[I]n a nuclear age, common sense cannot require one to interpret an ambiguous provision in a text in a way that requires a state passively to accept its fate before it can defend itself. And, even in the face of conventional warfare, this would also seem the only realistic interpretation of the contemporary right of self-defence. It is the potentially devastating consequences of prohibiting self-defence unless an armed attack has already occurred that leads one to prefer this interpretation – although it has to be said that, as a matter of simple construction of the words alone, another conclusion might be reached.\n\nIn assessing what will constitute an imminent attack, Greenwood argues that there are two additional factors which must be taken into account which did not exist at the time of the Caroline incident:57\n\nThe first is the gravity of the threat. The threat posed by a nuclear weapon, or a biological or chemical weapon, if used against a city, is so horrific that it is in a different league from the threats posed (as in the Caroline) by cross-border raids conducted by men armed only with rifles. Where the threat is an attack by weapons of mass destruction, the risk imposed upon a State by waiting until that attack actually takes place compounded by the impossibility for that State to afford its population any effective protection once the attack has been launched, mean that such an attack can reasonably be treated as imminent in circumstances where an attack by conventional means would not be so regarded. The second consideration is the method of delivery of the threat.

These would be material considerations in assessing whether, in any particular case, an attack should be treated as imminent.\n\nAlthough the existence of a right of anticipatory self-defence remains controversial, it is the view of the present author that a right of self-defence against an imminent attack is established in customary international law. The idea of computer network attacks as an indicator of an imminent attack is discussed in the following section.\n\n### 1.1.3. Computer network attacks and anticipatory self-defence\n\nThere are two situations where anticipatory self-defence may be implicated in the information warfare context: first, where a computer network attack serves as an imminent threat of a conventional attack; and secondly, where electronic activity indicates a severe computer network attack (which rises to the level of an armed attack) is imminent.\n\nAs with any assessment of an imminent attack the context of a computer network attack must be taken into account. Where a computer network attack is launched as a precursor to conventional attack, the target will be important. If an attack targets early warning systems, radar posts or satellite feeds, military communications, or emergency response systems it is likely that a state will judge a traditional attack to be imminent. The Israeli attack against the Syrian air-defence network is a case in point. Had Syria become aware of the intrusion and manipulation of its air-defence radar prior to the attack, they would have been entitled to use force in response. Indeed most military forces would claim that the neutralisation of the air-defence network was the beginning of the attack itself, and would certainly be included under Dinstein’s interceptive self-defence analysis.\n\nThe disruption of electrical power grids or financial systems, on the other hand, is unlikely to be sufficiently indicative of a subsequent conventional attack when viewed in isolation. Thus when Estonia was subject to distributed denial of service attacks against its banking, media and governmental sites, there were no realistic fears that this signalled the beginning of a traditional armed attack. The additional variables, such as positive attribution to a particular actor and possible motivation, are too many and too varied. However, when such attacks are viewed in conjunction with other contextual indicators, states may be more likely to conclude that a conventional attack is imminent.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press",

That conflict took place in an atmosphere of increased tensions between the states and in the face of skirmishes between separatist forces and the Georgian military. Prior to the physical invasion, a series of distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks were launched against the Georgian government, and media targets and commentators have noted the close coordination between the targets of the computer network attacks in specific areas and the later physical strikes.58 While it is tempting to conclude that the computer network attacks were indicative of the imminent physical invasion, analysts agree that there is no link evident between the Russian government and the attacks, and that patriotic hackers were behind the electronic disruptions.59 Given the increasing frequency with which hacktivist groups launch such denial of service attacks to further their causes or protest political decisions, it seems unlikely that states will be able to rely on such attacks as indicators even, and perhaps especially, in times of increased political tension.\n\nThe second instance where a computer network attack may be evidence of an imminent armed attack is the use of computer network intrusions to prepare an electronic battlespace. Viruses, worms, Trojan horses and other forms of malware routinely infect unprotected computers with malicious code which may corrupt data, cause a malfunction, record keystrokes, disable virus protection and collect other information such as passwords and other access codes, feeding them back to a remote attacker. One of the most common features of these types of malware is some form of backdoor payload which allows the attacker to access and control the computer at a later date. Such malware is most often used to 'recruit' unprotected computers to vast networks of compromised computers called botnets. Usually used for spam or criminal enterprise, the controllers of the botnet can also use the command and control servers of the botnet to direct the sending of large amounts of traffic to particular IP addresses, bringing them, and\n\n58 See, for example, US Cyber Consequences Unit, Overview by the US-CCU of the Cyber Campaign against Georgia in August of 2008, US Cyber Consequences Unit (2009) www.registan.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/US-CCU-Georgia-Cyber-Campaign-Overview.pdf (last accessed 25 February 2011); Project Grey Goose, Phase I Report: Russia/Georgia Cyber War – Findings and Analysis (2008).\n\n59 US Cyber Consequences Unit, Overview; Project Grey Goose, Phase I Report; Tikk, Kaska and Vihul, Cyber Incidents, 66–79.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press",

Botnets have been utilised in most major DDoS attacks reported to date, including against Estonia in 2007 and Georgia in 2008.⁶⁰\n\nThe inclusion of backdoor payloads in malware raises interesting questions in relation to anticipatory self-defence.⁶¹ It is clear that a backdoor has no other purpose than to allow an intruder control over the infected computer (whether by direct intrusion or remote control) at a later date. A question which must then be addressed is whether a state has the right to respond in anticipatory self-defence against the perpetrators of a computer network attack with a backdoor payload. Although a backdoor can be used for attacks at any point until it is discovered and removed, and such attacks may have far more serious consequences, including those which would qualify as an armed attack, in most cases, the later use is to send spam or launch DDoS attacks causing inconvenience and only economic damage. Without further information about the purpose or target of any later attack, the mere creation of a backdoor by a state adversary is not indicative of the type or gravity of the attack to follow; indeed the creation of a backdoor may merely be evidence of espionage.⁶² Most importantly from a legal perspective, the existence of a backdoor would not meet the ‘imminent’ criteria for lawful self-defence, as the timescale for any subsequent attack is variable; the attack could be launched within days or years.\n\nOther network intrusions may more indicative, but they will be highly dependent on the circumstances. Two points deserve comment. First, the method of delivery means that there may be little warning of an impending computer network attack; this was one of Greenwood’s additional factors to be considered when determining whether an attack is imminent.⁶³ However, Greenwood’s second factor, the gravity of threat, will depend entirely on the individual threat; as pointed out in the previous chapter, one of the difficulties with assessing computer\n\n⁶⁰ See, for example, Gadi Evron, ‘Battling Botnets and Online Mobs’ (2008) 9(1) GJIA 121, 124; Tikk, Kaska and Vihul, Cyber Incidents.\n⁶¹ A backdoor is a piece of code which opens a hidden or undocumented access point to the compromised computer or system, bypassing the authentication and security protocols and allowing remote access.\n⁶² Backdoors have been found on computers allegedly compromised by Chinese hackers.\n⁶³ Greenwood, ‘Pre-Emptive Use of Force’, 16.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press",

In this regard, with the very survival of the state not in question, it is unlikely that the threat would be assessed as imminent.\n\n## 1.1.4. The ‘Bush doctrine’ of pre-emptive self-defence65\n\nIn 2002 and 2006 the United States released two security strategy documents containing what appears to be a highly controversial attempt at enlarging the right to self-defence to include the use of force to preempt an attack which is merely threatened, but is not imminent. As Gray points out, there is some uncertainty as to the exact scope of the US claims; however, international criticism of the ‘Bush doctrine’ was both widespread and fierce.66 The 2002 National Security Strategy provided that:67\n\nWe must be prepared to stop rogue states and their terrorist clients before they are able to threaten or use weapons of mass destruction against the United States and our allies ...\n\n... Legal scholars and international jurists often conditioned the legitimacy of pre-emption on the existence of an imminent threat – most often a visible mobilization of armies, navies, and air forces preparing to attack.\n\nWe must adapt the concept of imminent threat to the capabilities and objectives of today’s adversaries ... The greater the threat, the greater is the risk of inaction – and the more compelling the case for taking anticipatory action to defend ourselves, even if uncertainty remains as to the time and place of the enemy’s attack. To forestall or prevent such hostile acts by our adversaries, the United States will, if necessary, act pre-emptively.\n\n64 Schmitt, ‘Normative Framework’, 912.\n\n65 This is also known as preventative or predictive self-defence in security studies circles. There is also much confusion in the legal literature regarding what exactly is being referred to by the terms anticipatory, pre-emptive and preventative self-defence.\n\n66 Gray, Use of Force (3rd edn), 211; Moir, Resort to Force, 79.\n\n67 White House, The National Security Strategy of the United States of America, White House, 2002), 15, www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/nss/nss_sep2002.pdf (last accessed 5 July 2011).\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press",

Greenwood has noted, far from removing the requirement of imminence ‘... practice also shows that the right of anticipatory self-defence is confined to instances where the armed attack is imminent’.⁶⁹ As noted above, while Greenwood accepts that the notion of imminence must take into account the gravity of the threat and its method of deliverance, he goes on to state: ‘In so far as talk of a doctrine of “pre-emption” is intended to refer to a broader right of self-defence to respond to threats that might materialize at some time in the future, such a doctrine has no basis in law.’⁷⁰ The issue has been debated extensively in the legal literature and will not be repeated here, save to say that state practice has not indicated widespread support for the doctrine, and both UN reports on security have rejected any wider right of pre-emptive self-defence, indicating it is for the Security Council to take pre-emptive action.⁷¹ In 2010 legal commentators watched with interest to see what the policy of the new US administration would be. However they were to be disappointed; while downplaying the idea of pre-emption, the Obama administration’s National Security Strategy 2010 does not dismiss it, merely stating that states must ‘adhere to standards that govern the use of force’ without elaborating further on what those standards might be.⁷² The relevance of this apparent\n\n⁶⁸ White House, National Security Strategy of the United States of America (White House, 2006), 23.

Pinprick attacks or accumulation of events theory\n\nComputer network attacks falling below the armed attack threshold may still trigger a forcible response by states. The most likely strategy utilising computer network attacks is to launch a swarm of lesser attacks, rather than a single large strike qualifying as an armed attack. In a short story published in 1998, John Arquilla detailed what a sustained cyber attack might look like:77 power blackouts, followed by weekly virus attacks of the magnitude of the Nimda, Slammer or Mydoom viruses, oil pipeline ruptures all launched within a matter of days of one another. While some of these attacks may cross the threshold of uses of force under Article 2(4), it is unlikely that any taken on their own would be considered an armed attack under current international law. An analogy may be drawn with cases of repeated cross-border incursions.

The ‘pinprick’ or ‘accumulation of events’ theory has been unsuccessfully argued in the past by several states, including the United Kingdom,⁷⁸ the United States,⁷⁹ South Africa and Israel,⁸⁰ in an attempt to justify actions purportedly taken in self-defence, that might otherwise be disproportionate. Although the Security Council rejected the claims by these states, each time it has done so on the specific facts of the case and on grounds that such actions were disproportionate. In each instance the condemnation by the Security Council suggested that the actions were unlawful reprisals, rather than commenting on the doctrinal issue of the scope of self-defence.⁸¹ Likewise, the International Court of Justice has avoided expressly discussing the issue, although it appears willing to contemplate the possibility of an accumulation of events amounting to an armed attack. The Court in the Nicaragua (Merits) case commented with regard to the incursions by Nicaragua into the territory of Honduras and Costa Rica:⁸²\n\nVery little information is available to the Court as to the circumstances of these incursions or to their possible motivations, which renders it difficult to decide whether they may be treated for legal purposes as amounting, singly or collectively, to an ‘armed attack’ by Nicaragua on either or both States.\n\n⁷⁸ In 1964 the Southern Arab Federation (SAF) which had military links with the United Kingdom, complained of an armed attack by the Yemen which consisted of a ‘series of aggressions’; invoking collective self-defence at the SAF’s request, the UK launched an air strike and destroyed a fort. The Security Council did not accept the reasoning and issued a statement condemning reprisals as ‘incompatible with the principles and purposes of the UN’.

This view is reiterated in the Oil Platforms, Cameroon/Nigeria and Armed Activities (DRC v. Uganda) cases.⁸³ In all three cases, while not expressly discussing the doctrine, the Court appears to permit the concept of an armed attack through cumulative attacks; however, the Court found that neither the United States, Cameroon nor Uganda respectively had sufficiently proved the facts or imputability to the other party.⁸⁴ This doctrine has obvious application for the victims of protracted campaigns involving low-intensity computer network attacks. However, as with their conventional equivalents, the devil will be in the detail, conclusively proving that the attribution of computer network attacks is a notoriously difficult and time-consuming task.⁸⁵\n\nOne final point should be noted: not all attacks which are launched from multiple computers will require a cumulative approach to qualify as an armed attack. A DDoS attack of sufficient scale and effect to elevate it above a ‘mere frontier incident’ would be considered a single attack as the attack originates from a single controller.⁸⁶ That is, although the attack appears to come from large numbers of computers in disparate locations, the compromised computers all receive their attack and targeting instructions via command and control servers manipulated from a single controlling ‘master’ which directs the botnet.⁸⁷ This is merely the electronic equivalent of an attack using more than one soldier, or a wave of bombers in an air strike.\n\n## 2.

Those arguing for a restricted right point to Article 51’s role as an exception to the prohibition contained in Article 2(4) to argue that it should likewise be constrained to armed attacks by states. Those, including the present author, who consider there is a broader right of self-defence point to state practice, the fact that Article 51 reflects an ‘inherent right’ rather than establishing one, and the recognition by the International Court of Justice in the Nicaragua (Merits) case that the Charter by no means reflects the whole of the body of law governing force.⁸⁹\n\nAs noted above, the International Court of Justice in its controversial decision in the Nicaragua (Merits) case, has addressed the issue of when a state might be held responsible for indirect military action by rebels acting ‘on behalf’ of a foreign state, establishing the test of ‘effective control’.⁹⁰ For computer network attacks, where attribution is one of the major problems, this test will prove particularly difficult to satisfy and commentators have been quick to point out the advantages that such plausible deniability will offer to sending states. However, the question of whether a state has a right to respond with force to an armed attack by a non-state actor absent a degree of state complicity has proved a far more difficult question, and one on which the International Court of Justice has been reluctant to comment. The issue has been covered extensively in recent legal literature, and it is not proposed to conduct a full survey of the arguments here, other than to note that there appears to be a divergence between the limited jurisprudence of the Court and emerging state practice on the issue.⁹¹\n\nIt is safe to say that the Court’s treatment of the matter has caused more confusion than clarification.

However Israel does not claim that the attacks against it are imputable to a foreign State.’93 The Court goes on to note that the threat to which Israel is responding emanates from territory which is controlled by Israel. Although some commentators have taken this to mean that there is no right of self-defence against non-state actors, Gray has argued that this is merely a statement of the basic right of self-defence and that the Court does not say this is the only time there is a right to self-defence.94 The Court once again had an opportunity to consider the right of states to use force against attacks by non-state actors in the Armed Activities case between DRC and Uganda. The Court, however, chose to limit itself strictly to a discussion of the attributability of the acts complained of to a state – applying the Nicaragua test – and expressly declined to discuss the issue of ‘whether and under what conditions contemporary international law provides for a right of self defence against large-scale attacks by irregular forces’.95 However, as Moir has pointed out, by deciding that Uganda’s actions could not amount to self-defence as the attacks complained of could not be attributed to the DRC, they effectively answered the question in the negative in any case.96\n\nSurveys of state practice, on the other hand, tend to suggest a much greater willingness on the part of the international community to accept the possibility of self-defence against armed attacks by non-state actors without attribution to a state.97 Moir notes, however, that a certain level of support and involvement on the part of the state is required, and is consistently asserted by states claiming the right.98 Thomas Franck suggests that measures taken in self-defence against non-state actors will be accepted by the international community where victim states have identified correctly the place from where it was attacked, that the authorities in that place deliberately, knowingly\n\n92 Gray, Use of Force (3rd edn); Sean D.

First, as discussed in section 3 below, correctly identifying and attributing an attack to a particular perpetrator in a timely manner is one of the most difficult problems in the field of computer network attacks, both from a technical standpoint and a legal one. To be able to do so in a manner that is clear and verifiable by the international community so as to back a claim for the legitimate exercise of self-defence will be an added level of difficulty. Second, even once computer forensics have established the origins of the attacks, proving a sufficient level of support and involvement by a state will be difficult. For example, the computer network attacks against Georgia demonstrated a high level of coordination between the cyber attacks launched by ‘patriotic hackers’ and the military operations carried out by Russia. Russia has denied any involvement with the attacks, and no evidence has been found of state organisations guiding or directing the attacks ‘be it because there was none, because the collection efforts were not far-reaching or deep enough to identify those connections, or because involvement by state organisations was conducted in a way to purposefully avoid attribution’.¹⁰⁰ There was certainly not enough to prove involvement of the Russian authorities in any official capacity,¹⁰¹ particularly absent the context of the military operations.¹⁰² In addition, states will find it very difficult to prevent or even be aware of computer network attacks emanating from their territory, particularly given the high prevalence of technologies such as proxy servers.\n\nThe final factor raised by Franck in determining whether the international community is likely to accept a claim by a state acting in self-defence against a non-state actor is the proportionality of the response. The question of proportionality is discussed in section 4 below; however, there are a few issues which pertain specifically to non-state actors. First, states have been quick to condemn actions\n\n⁹⁹ Franck, Recourse to Force, 68.\n¹⁰⁰ Project Grey Goose, Phase I Report, 3.\n¹⁰¹ Some investigators provided circumstantial evidence of possible involvement by individual officials within the Russian administration; however, many experts remain sceptical of these claims.

Secondly, the dispersed nature of many computer network attacks means that the non-state actors responsible for the attack may be resident in several different host states, complicating the proportionality assessment of any forcible response. It should be noted, however, that the most obvious example of such a dispersed attack, the DDoS attack, would rarely rise to the level of gravity required for an armed attack, absent involvement in a wider programme of attacks that could be responded to under the doctrine of accumulation of events.\n\nOne final point deserves comment: computer network attacks may also provide a unique opportunity for states to take action against non-state actors without violating the territorial integrity of the state from which they are acting; however, non-state actors are less likely to have infrastructure that would provide viable targets for forcible computer network attacks.¹⁰⁴\n\n# 3. Attribution\n\nOne of the major problems with any computer network attack is the attribution of the attack to a particular actor. While the origin of some attacks becomes immediately evident, either because the attacker identifies themselves,¹⁰⁵ or because they precede traditional attacks that are easily attributed to a particular source,¹⁰⁶ other attacks will be launched anonymously. Given the common use of botnets and the frequency of IP spoofing that takes place in computer network attacks,¹⁰⁷\n\n¹⁰³ See, for example, the international condemnation of the Israeli attacks against Lebanon in 2006 in response to attacks by Hezbollah, and also the comment of the ICJ in the Armed Activities case that the taking of airports and towns many kilometres away from the site of the series of transborder attacks complained of did not seem proportionate: Armed Activities Case, para. 147.\n\n¹⁰⁴ See, for example, the opinion of Judge Higgins in the Wall case, dissenting on the grounds that non-forcible measures such as the construction of a wall do not really fall within the concept of self-defence.\n\n¹⁰⁵ For example, the 'I Love You' virus source code contained the 'signature' of the author.\n\n¹⁰⁶ For example, the Israeli attack on the Syrian air-defences in advance of an air strike.\n\n¹⁰⁷ IP spoofing essentially forges the data identifying the sending computer in the header of a data packet so that it appears to originate from a different IP address, thus any response is sent to the forged computer.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press",

An early example of the latter problem occurred in 1999 when a denial of service attack was launched against the US Department of Transport. The attack appeared to emanate from a server in Maryland run by followers of the Falun Gong movement; in fact, the attack was designed to take down both the Maryland server and the Department of Transport network server, leaving the Falun Gong bearing the blame. However, the attackers had blundered and the attack was traced to a computer located at the address of China's Ministry of Public Security. No information is publicly available regarding the US response to this attack; however, in 2002 Richard Clarke, then White House technology advisor, stated before a Senate Judiciary subcommittee hearing on cyber terrorism that the government had never been able to prove to their satisfaction that a particular government was responsible for a specific unauthorised intrusion.[108]\n\nThe proliferation of botnets also makes attribution difficult. As the 2007 denial of service attacks against Estonia proved, it can be very difficult to differentiate between attacks that originate from a particular address and those which are merely utilising a compromised computer. Although some of the IP addresses involved in the attacks against Estonia were traced to official IP addresses of Russian state authorities, Russia denied any involvement and claimed that these computers had been compromised and were being manipulated from outside the Kremlin. Subsequent reports by cyber security analysts tend to back this claim, pointing to the lack of evidence and also noting the possibility of spoofing the IP address of the attacker.[109]\n\nOf course, problems of attribution aren't restricted to cyberspace. Armed attacks following more conventional patterns are often carried out anonymously, or responsibility is claimed by armed groups which appear unlikely to have the resources required for such an attack. Further, in the case of state-sponsored terrorism, it is unlikely that any state will step forward to take responsibility for kinetic acts, let alone electronic ones.

For example, when Russia moved troops into South Ossetia following the Georgian offensive in 2008, the air strikes and ground forces were accompanied by a series of computer network attacks against Georgian servers. While these attacks were certainly not serious enough to amount to armed attacks, given Georgia's limited internet connectivity, they illustrate the capacity for other actors to effectively 'join-in' a conflict with or without state authorisation. Several security analysts reported botnets allegedly controlled by the Russian Business Network, a group known to be linked to cyber crime, launching denial of service attacks at Georgian servers. However, software was also freely available for download to individual computers from Russian language websites such as 'stopgeorgia.ru' along with a list of targets, making joining the cyber offensive as simple as a few mouse clicks.¹¹¹ As noted previously, the Russian government denies any involvement with the attacks;¹¹² however, the issue raises the difficult question of state responsibility for non-state actors and the necessity or degree of state involvement or complicity required before force can be used in self-defence against the state. This book does not address this issue in depth; suffice it to note that there is little agreement in the international community on the issue in relation to conventional attacks, let alone computer network attacks.¹¹³ However, it is clear that a state must not knowingly allow its territory to be used as a sanctuary for terrorists or armed bands bent on attacking military targets or civilian objects in another country.¹¹⁴\n\nThe difficulty of attribution also affects the victim state's ability to engage in forcible countermeasures in self-defence.¹¹⁵ The Court in the\n\n¹¹⁰ Dinstein, 'CNA and Self-Defense', 112.\n¹¹¹ John Markoff, 'Before the Gunfire, Cyberattacks', New York Times, 13 August 2008; Evgeny Morozov, 'An Army of Ones and Zeroes: How I Became a Soldier in the Georgia-Russia Cyberwar', Slate, 14 August 2008, www.slate.com/id/2197514/ (last accessed 12 April 2011).\n¹¹² Siobhan Gorman, 'Georgia States Computers Hit by Cyberattack', Wall Street Journal (New York), 12 August 2008, A9.\n¹¹³ For a discussion of legal attribution and state responsibility for non-state actors' use of force see generally Gray, Use of Force (2nd edn).\n¹¹⁴ Ian Brownlie, 'International Law and the Activities of Armed Bands' (1958) 7 International and Comparative Law Quarterly 712, 734, cited in Dinstein, War, Aggression, and Self-Defense, 206.\n¹¹⁵ Sharp, Cyberspace and the Use of Force, 133, cited in Dinstein, 'CNA and Self-Defense', 111.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press",

Roberts* had been sufficiently imputed to Iran, the US had not complained to Iran of the military activities of the platforms, which suggested that the attacks on the platforms was not seen as a necessary act.¹²⁵\n\nThe principle of necessity also gives rise to a related principle, namely that actions taken in self-defence must generally be taken without undue delay.¹²⁶ In the case of computer network attacks, this may make successful claims of self-defence more difficult. Where the origins of a computer network attack are not obvious, the time taken to conduct computer forensics and establish hard evidence of the identity of the perpetrator may militate against a finding that any subsequent action by the victim state is in self-defence. Similar criticisms were levelled at the United States after a delay of several weeks between the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon and subsequent action in Afghanistan.¹²⁷ Likewise, the Court in the *Nicaragua (Merits)* case also criticised the US for commencing activities purportedly in self-defence several months after the major offensive of the opposition against the government of El Salvador had been completely repulsed, although ultimately dismissing the claim of self-defence on other grounds.¹²⁸ However, Dinstein notes that this requirement must not be construed too strictly; he points to the delay of approximately five months between the invasion of Kuwait and the authorisation of all necessary means by the Security Council.¹²⁹\n\nThe principle of proportionality requires the weighing of the response against its permitted purpose of halting and repelling the attack, or, in the case of anticipatory self-defence, preventing it from\n\n¹²³ Dinstein, ‘CNA and Self-Defense’, 109.\n¹²⁴ Roberto Ago, ‘Addendum to the Eighth Report on State Responsibility’ (1980) II UN Y.B.

Whether or not an act is proportionate will necessarily be dependent on the facts of the situation; however, the action must not be retaliatory or punitive, its lawfulness cannot be measured ‘except by its capacity for achieving the desired result’.¹³⁰ This raises an interesting question with respect to computer network attacks; namely whether it would ever be proportionate to use traditional armed force against an electronic attack. The answer must surely be in the affirmative. Proportionality does not restrict the defending state to the same weapons or the same numbers of armed forces as the attacking state; nor is it necessarily limited to action on its own territory.¹³¹ Therefore it would be open to the victim of a computer network attack to use whatever weapons it has at its disposal to repel the attack, as long as the response is proportionate to that purpose. As Ago notes:¹³²\n\nIn the case of self-defence, it was essential to avoid the error of thinking that there should be some proportionality between the action of the aggressor and the action of the state defending itself. Proportionality could be judged only in terms of the objective of the action, which was to repel an attack and prevent it from succeeding. No limitations that might prejudice the success of a response to attack could be placed on the State suffering the attack. The concept of reasonable action must of course enter into the matter, since self-defence could not justify a genuine act of aggression committed in response to an armed attack of limited proportions.\n\nThus, if a computer network attack is being used to prepare the battlespace for a conventional attack, the use of military force in response must be proportionate in relation to the need to repel the attack as a whole. However, it should be noted that while physically bombing the attacking computers and their owners may be legal, it is not necessarily the preferred method of response.¹³³ Only a few examples of state intrusion have been made public to date, and no large-scale attacks as would justify a forcible response have been reported.

For example, the attack on the US Department of Transport that was attributed to the Falun Gong originated elsewhere, and despite initial accusations against Russia, the attacks on Estonia and Georgia are now widely believed to be the work of independent ‘patriotic hackers’. As noted, routing attacks through other actors, or spoofing their IP addresses to cast blame may serve as a political end in itself.\n\n## 5. Countermeasures against unlawful acts\n\nWhere a computer network attack does not rise to the level of an armed attack, a state may still respond with proportionate countermeasures. However, where forcible countermeasures are taken in response to an ordinary breach of international law, not constituting an armed attack, they are unlawful.¹³⁶\n\nHowever, an alternate line of reasoning, arising out of the controversial gap theory put forward by the majority of the International Court of Justice in the Nicaragua (Merits) decision, appears to have muddied the waters somewhat. The Court held that acts committed by Nicaragua against El Salvador, Honduras and Costa Rica amounted to less grave forms of ‘illegal military intervention’.¹³⁷ The Court held that that ‘proportionate counter-measures’ were permissible on the part of the victim state; however, they did not create any entitlement by any third state to take collective countermeasures involving the use\n\nHezbollah telecommunications network.

Either the Court was saying:¹³⁹\n\n(a) that there are some acts of force that nobody, not even the victim, may resist by proportionate measures of force; or it was saying (b) that the victim may resist with force provided that it does so alone. There is little to be said in explanation of the latter proposition other than it is simply a[n] ... arbitrary announcement of the Court.\n\nHargrove argues that allowing forcible countermeasures ‘would in one remarkable stroke manage both to impair the right of self-defense, and to weaken fundamentally the prohibition on the use of force by creating an open-ended and wholly new category of exceptions to Article 2(4) of the Charter, of unknown content and limit.’¹⁴⁰ However, Judge Simma in his separate opinion in the *Oil Platforms* case has argued that the Court in the *Nicaragua (Merits)* case cannot, in the context of that case, have understood that to mean mere pacific reprisals.¹⁴¹ He argues that the Court can only have meant ‘defensive military action “short of” full-scale self-defence’.¹⁴²\n\nBut we may encounter also a lower level of hostile military action, not reaching the threshold of an ‘armed attack’ within the meaning of Article 51 of the United Nations Charter. Against such hostile acts, a state may of course defend itself, but only within a more limited range and quality of responses (the main difference being that the possibility of collective self-defence does not arise, cf. *Nicaragua*) and bound to necessity, proportionality and immediacy in time in a particularly strict way.\n\nSimma’s treatment of the conditions in respect of forcible countermeasures is clearly linked to the classic self-defence analysis, rather\n\n¹³⁸ ‘[A] use of force of a lesser degree of gravity cannot ... produce any entitlement to take collective counter-measures involving the use of force.

This argument may prove beneficial to a state which is subjected to computer network attacks that rise to the level of force, particularly where it is unsure whether its planned proportionate response might likewise be considered an illegal use of force. It should be noted, however, that this is a minority view and that most commentators maintain that forcible countermeasures are prohibited under international law as armed reprisals.\n\nWhere a computer network attack does not amount to an armed attack (or a use of force), any countermeasures taken by the victim state will be conditional on, and limited by, the law relating to countermeasures.¹⁴³ In the Case Concerning the Gabcikovo-Nagymaros Project, the International Court of Justice set out a three-part test justifying proportionate countermeasures. First, the action must be taken in response to an internationally wrongful act of another state and be directed against that state. Second, the victim state must have called upon the offending state to discontinue its wrongful conduct or to make reparation for it. And finally, the effects of the countermeasure must be commensurate with the injury suffered, taking account of the rights in question.¹⁴⁴ In this regard the test for proportionality differs between countermeasures and self-defence, where the response must be proportional to the threat, rather than the actual harm suffered. However, the Court also stated that the purpose of the countermeasures must be to induce the wrongdoing state to comply with its obligations under international law, and that the measure must therefore be reversible.¹⁴⁵ In respect of a computer network attack this would seem to fit with current state practice; most attacks to date have merely resulted in states requesting the alleged perpetrator of the attack to cease their actions.¹⁴⁶ However, the nature of computer network attacks, including the type of attacks they make possible and, most importantly, their ability to be reversed, makes computer network attacks particularly useful as a countermeasure against a previous wrongful act of a state.

US Department of Defense specialists created a program that would recognise the Floodnet applet installed on computers trying to access the Department of Defense website.¹⁴⁷ Once the applet was identified, a program was sent back to the activist’s computer to shut down their web browser, thus ending the attack.¹⁴⁸ Although criticisms were levelled at the Department for not thoroughly considering the legal ramifications of such a response,¹⁴⁹ the United States’ decision to respond electronically, in this instance, against an attack which they had been expecting, must be considered a proportionate countermeasure, particularly against a demonstrably non-violent protest group. There was some speculation that this approach was being renewed by the US Department of Defense in its ‘active defence’ policy released in 2011;¹⁵⁰ statements made by Lynn prior to release of the policy indicated that the US intended to stop threats before they reached Department of Defense networks.

Security Council authorisation and collective measures\n\nOther than self-defence under Article 51, the only other exception to the prohibition on the use of force under the UN Charter is the authorisation of collective security measures under Chapter VII. The Security Council has ‘primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security’ and may recommend or authorise member states to engage in measures, which may include the use of force, in order to pursue this aim. Article 39 provides:\n\nThe Security Council shall determine the existence of any threat to the peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression and shall make recommendations, or decide what measures shall be taken in accordance with Articles 41 and 42, to maintain or restore international peace and security.\n\nThis raises two separate issues for the use of computer network attacks. First, when will the Security Council consider computer network attacks to be a ‘threat to the peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression’; and second, under what circumstances might measures authorised by the Security Council under Chapter VII include computer network attacks?\n\nAs noted, prior to the Security Council recommending action, it must determine that a ‘threat to the peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression’ exists under Article 39. In practice, the Council has almost exclusively exercised its powers by finding a ‘threat to international peace and security’, even in situations where a breach of the peace or act of aggression is obvious;¹⁵² thus the analysis will concentrate on this broader standard. Whether or not there are any limits on the Security Council’s ability to determine a threat to the peace is the subject of debate amongst legal scholars;¹⁵³ however, it is generally accepted that the Council possesses considerable discretion in this respect. The resulting range of situations in which the Security Council has found a threat to the peace is increasingly broad and includes the danger of violent countermeasures by states to violations of international law, regardless of their admissibility.¹⁵⁴ The Council has also\n\n¹⁵² Jochen Frowein, ‘Article 39’ in B.

He argues that a threat to the peace exists when, in a particular situation, a danger of the use of force on a considerable scale arises.[160] Although the Security Council has not considered any computer network attacks to date,[161] based on this assessment it would certainly appear that a computer network attack would constitute a threat to the peace where it is of sufficient gravity that a state is likely to respond to it with force, regardless of whether it is categorised as an armed attack, or where the type of attack indicates further violence to follow, whether electronically or by kinetic means.\n\nOnce the Security Council has determined a threat to the peace, the Council may make recommendations, or require states to take action under Articles 40, 41 and 42 of the Charter, for the restoration or maintenance of international peace and security.

As noted earlier, force is not necessarily the preferred means of countering a cyber attack because of the distributed nature of many methods of attack.\n\nA more interesting scenario is the possibility of the Security Council authorising computer network attacks of sufficient gravity to amount to a use of force in response to a threat to the peace. For example, in the past few years the Security Council has passed a series of resolutions expressing its concern over the proliferation risks presented by the Iranian nuclear programme.¹⁶⁸ Although the Council has not explicitly stated that it considers that the programme represents a threat to international peace and security, this is far from unusual; it is clear from the practice of the Council that no formal pronouncement with an express reference to Article 39 is necessary; the use of the language is apparently sufficient.¹⁶⁹ The Council does, however, explicitly state that it is acting under Article 41 of Chapter VII of the Charter, and each resolution calls for member states to implement a series of specific non-forceful measures against Iran.

Although Resolution 1929 (2010) specifically stresses that it does not authorise any measures exceeding the scope of the resolution,¹⁷⁰ or the threat or use of force, had the measures decided on been taken under Article 42 with its usual phraseology ‘all necessary means’, the Stuxnet worm would have proved an efficient way to achieve one of the aims of the resolution, namely the suspension of enrichment-related activities.\n\n## 7. Conclusion\n\nAs with the discussion in the previous chapter relating to the use of force, the classification of computer network attacks as armed attacks sits on top of a deep doctrinal divide between those who would argue for a wide interpretation of the right to self-defence and those who would restrict it. The present author believes that in regard to computer network attacks, a restrictive view of the armed attack threshold and the subsequent right to self-defence is preferable. Classification of computer network attacks which would amount to armed attacks should therefore be restricted to those attacks which cause physical damage to property or persons of a sufficient scale and effect. Given the particular difficulties and length of time involved in accurately attributing attacks and the fact that states acting in self-defence are not restricted to responding in kind, the danger of computer network attacks escalating into traditional conflict is apparent. That is not to say that states cannot respond to computer network attacks that do not rise to the level of an armed attack; a state may still respond with proportionate countermeasures or appeal to the Security Council for a finding that the attacks amount to a threat to the peace.\n\n¹⁷⁰ Thus even if Stuxnet had not resulted in physical damage but merely stopped the enrichment facility from working it could not have fallen within the terms of the Security Council authorisations.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press",

  "full_text": "# 3 Armed attack and response in the digital age\nHaving looked at computer network attacks as a prohibited act in the previous chapter, this chapter will look at the exceptions to the prohibition; the permissible response to the prohibited act. The UN Charter system admits only two exceptions to the prohibition on the use of force: collective measures authorised by the Security Council acting under Chapter VII of the Charter; or the inherent right of collective or individual self-defence provided for in Article 51.\nThe exact scope of the right of self-defence remains one of the divisive issues in international law, so it is not surprising that its application to the topic of computer network attacks is particularly complex. First, it is difficult to identify the point at which a computer network attack will rise to the level of an 'armed attack', the threshold that triggers a state's right to self-defence. As seen in the previous chapter, traditional international law focuses on personal injury, fatality and damage to physical property as measures of the seriousness of an attack. This approach is favoured by most commentators writing on the subject to date;¹ however, many catastrophically damaging computer network attacks will not cause any of these deleterious consequences. Further, it is likely that many attacks using computer network operations will not come as a single instance, but rather as a series of events which, taken separately, may not be sufficient to qualify as an armed attack. This raises the issue of the right to respond to 'pin-prick' attacks with a single use of force, a concept which has had a chequered history in international law. The likelihood that computer network attacks will\n¹ See Horace B. Robertson, 'Self-Defense against Computer Network Attack under International Law' in M. N. Schmitt and B. T. O'Donnell (eds.), Computer Network Attack and International Law (Naval War College, Newport, RI, 2002) 122–45, 136, for examples of authors adopting the consequence-based approach.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nARMED ATTACK AND RESPONSE IN THE DIGITAL AGE\nbe used in conjunction with, or as a precursor to, a conventional attack may also raise a right to respond to such attacks under the auspices of the controversial doctrine of anticipatory self-defence. For example, will intrusion into an air defence network be sufficient evidence of an imminent attack following the 2007 Israeli raid on the alleged Syrian nuclear site.\nThe second major difficulty with computer network attacks, as opposed to traditional kinetic attacks, is the difficulty of attributing an attack to its original perpetrator. The length of time required to trace an attack makes questions of the necessity of force to repel a computer network attack difficult to satisfy. Questions of proportionality also arise in determining whether it would ever be proportionate to use armed force in response to a computer network attack. This chapter examines these questions in light of current international law, the definition of armed attack and considers in what circumstances force may be used in self-defence against a computer network attack.\nThe final sections address the authorisation to use force under the auspices of Chapter VII Security Council resolutions, and what measures might be taken by states in response to computer network attacks which fail to meet the threshold for lawful self-defence.\n# 1. Armed attack\nThe right of self-defence is a customary law right, inherent in the sovereignty of states; it has been codified for the most part by Article 51 of the UN Charter as follows:\nNothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security. Measures taken by Members in the exercise of this right of self-defence shall be immediately reported to the Security Council and shall not in any way affect the authority and responsibility of the Security Council under the present Charter to take at any time such action as it deems necessary in order to maintain or restore international peace and security.\nThe customary status of the right has been confirmed by the Nicaragua (Merits) case.² Article 51 of the Charter allows self-defence in response to an 'armed attack' and the International Court of Justice has\n² Nicaragua (Merits), para. 176.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nARMED ATTACK\nconfirmed in both the Nicaragua (Merits) and Oil Platforms decisions that nothing short of an armed attack (with the possible exception of an anticipated armed attack) will be sufficient to trigger the right of self-defence under international law.³ The Oil Platforms case also established that it is for the state using force in self-defence to prove that it has been subjected to an armed attack.⁴ However, as with the term ‘force’, the Charter does not provide a definition of ‘armed attack’. Further, the historical predecessors to the Charter system do not offer any interpretive assistance. Neither the Kellogg-Briand Pact nor the Covenant of the League of Nations refer to the term. Both formulate self-defence as a response to aggression; hence all attempts at definition were focused on that term.⁵ The drafting history of the Charter provides evidence that discussions took place on the difference between an attack and an armed attack (based on the fact that the United States draft of 11 May 1945 contained both terms) and although no definitive conclusion was reached, the term was replaced by armed attack only.⁶ Professor Ian Brownlie has pointed out that it is likely that the records of the San Francisco conference contain no definition of the phrase ‘armed attack’ because the term was considered ‘sufficiently clear’ and ‘self-evident’.⁷ That was certainly the case in the drafting of the North Atlantic Treaty around the same time, as evidenced by the comments of the Foreign Relations Committee of the United States Senate which noted that the phrase ‘armed attack’ in Article 5 ‘is ordinarily self evident’ and ‘there is rarely, if ever, any doubt as to whether it has occurred or by whom it was launched’.⁸ The decision of the International Court of Justice in the Nicaragua (Merits) case made clear that armed attacks form a subset of the term ‘force’ in Article 2(4); therefore those actions which have been discussed in the previous chapter as falling outside the ambit of the definition of armed force will subsequently also fail to meet the threshold of an armed attack. However, not every use of force will be an armed attack,\n³ Ibid.; Case Concerning Oil Platforms (Islamic Republic of Iran v. United States of America) (2003), International Court of Justice, para. 51.\n⁴ Oil Platforms Case, para. 57.\n⁵ Stanimir A.

The Court sees no reason to deny that, in customary law, the prohibition of armed attacks may apply to the sending by a State of armed bands to the territory of another State, if such an operation, because of its scale and effects, would have been classified as an armed attack rather than as a mere frontier incident had it been carried out by regular armed forces.\nThe Court goes on to consider that acts such as ‘assistance to rebels in the form of the provision of weapons or logistical or other support’ do not constitute an armed attack, but might nonetheless constitute a threat or use of force, or amount to intervention in the internal or external affairs of other states.¹¹ Despite being the subject of much criticism and discussion, the Court’s decision makes clear that under current international law the definition of ‘armed attack’ is dependent on the ‘scale and effects’ of an attack which must be of sufficient gravity to elevate such actions beyond ‘mere frontier incidents’.¹² The view that an armed attack must be of ‘relatively large scale and with substantial effect’ is reiterated by several leading scholars,¹³ and is in\n⁹ Nicaragua (Merits), para. 195. ¹⁰ Ibid.\n¹¹ Ibid., para. 195, 231. This position was strongly criticised by Judges Schwebel and Jennings in their dissenting opinions, Schwebel holding that the term substantial involvement in the Definition of Aggression meant that an armed attack could include financial and logistical support.\n¹² Ibid., para. 195.\n¹³ See, for example, Randelzhofer, ‘Article 51’, 796 (with accompanying citations). See also Dinstein, ‘CNA and Self-Defense’, 100, noting that the use of force must be of sufficient gravity before armed attack is in progress, no matter that it be of small magnitude.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nARMED ATTACK\nagreement with the de minimis rule for small-scale attacks set out in Article 2 of the Definition of Aggression adopted by the UN General Assembly, an example also given by the Court in the Nicaragua (Merits) case.^[14]\nThe Court's distinction between 'the most grave forms of the use of force (those constituting an armed attack)' and 'other less grave forms',^[15] and the resultant gap between force and armed attack, results in the peculiar situation where an illegal use of force not tantamount to an armed attack may be launched by one state against another, leaving the victim state unable to respond in self-defence. Logically and pragmatically the gap has to be quite narrow, inasmuch as 'there is very little effective protection against states violating the prohibition on the use of force, as long as they do not resort to an armed attack'.^[16] Michael Schmitt has commented that this distinction makes sense in light of the Charter's central purpose to 'maintain international peace and security' as it creates a rebuttable presumption against the resort by states to violence.^[17] Thus he notes 'it is logical to interpret the prohibition on the use of force expansively, but characterize exceptions that lie outside the community decisional architecture, such as self-defense, narrowly'.^[18]\nOther commentators, including Judge Simma in a separate opinion in the Oil Platforms case, have argued, however, that it makes no logical sense to prohibit a state from forcibly defending itself or permitting its allies to come to the state's defence where it is the subject of an unlawful use of force.^[19] Any fears of an unwarranted escalation of an incident can be dealt with under the existing rules pertaining to proportionality.^[20] Despite such debate, following the Nicaragua (Merits) and\n^[14] The Security Council may determine whether actions falling under the examples given in Article 3 do not constitute 'acts of aggression' owing to their lack of gravity.

However, the thresholds of each of these concepts, and the responses which each allows, are yet to be established with any certainty.\nThis uncertainty makes the classification of any computer network attack particularly difficult. As noted previously, the possible effects of computer network attacks 'span the spectrum of consequentiality',[21] thus making classification based on the type of computer network attack impossible; each attack must be assessed on its merits. It seems certain, however, that where a computer network attack causes destruction and fatalities on a par with a conventional attack, a state will have a right to respond in self-defence. This is the conclusion reached in a report by the Office of General Counsel of the US Department of Defense, which concluded:[22]\n[I]f a coordinated computer network attack shuts down a nation's air traffic control system along with its banking and financial systems and public utilities, and opens the floodgates of several dams resulting in general flooding that causes widespread civilian deaths and property damage, it may well be that no-one would challenge a victim nation if it concluded that it was the victim of an armed attack, or of an act equivalent to an armed attack.\nWhile undoubtedly correct, the report fails to separate and analyse the attack in its component parts, combining those components which directly cause death and destruction with less severe attacks. Schmitt focuses on the consequences of the attack rather than on the object of the attack or on the intentions of the attacker; the exception being where the intentions of the attacker are specifically to cause physical damage to tangible objects or injury to human beings, in which case Schmitt considers the resort to armed force is permitted.[23] He argues that self-defence should be limited to operations which are de facto armed attacks, or imminently preparatory thereto; the net result being a limitation on both sides to resort to computer network attack techniques which might threaten global stability and on individual responses which might themselves prove destabilising.[24]\n21 Schmitt, 'Normative Framework', 912.\n22 Office of General Counsel, An Assessment on International Legal Issues in Information Operations, United States Department of Defense (1999) www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/dod-io-legal/dod-io-legal.pdf (last accessed 5 July 2011).\n23 Schmitt, 'Normative Framework', 928.\n24 Ibid., 886. This is in accord with his generally contextualist analysis discussed in Chapter 2.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nARMED ATTACK\nIn contrast, Walter Sharp, one of the early authors on the subject, argues that any intrusion into systems containing information which is critical to the national security of the victim state should be considered an armed attack capable of triggering the right to respond with force.²⁵ This idea is premised on the notion that the features of modern society and its reliance on information systems are such that non-military means can often cause more harm than military ones.²⁶ However Sharp’s ‘strict liability’ approach has not been borne out by state practice, which to date has recognised such intrusions as simple espionage, an act not prohibited under international law.\nThe present author considers that the threshold for an armed attack conducted by computer network attack must be set in line with current international law regulating the right of self-defence. A state is therefore permitted to respond in self-defence when it is the victim of a computer network attack causing damage to property or persons of sufficient scale and effect to elevate it beyond the equivalent of a frontier incident. The denial of service attacks against Estonia in 2007, disruptive as they were, did not reach this level; neither did the attacks launched the following year against Georgia, although the analysis of that incident is complicated by the subsequent conventional attacks by Russia.²⁷ No loss of life, physical injury or destruction of property was suffered as a result of the computer network operations launched against either state. In contrast, the 2010 Stuxnet worm has purportedly resulted in significant destruction of property. At the time of writing, reports indicate that the worm may be responsible for Iran having to replace 1,000 of the 9,000 IR-1 centrifuges at the Natanz nuclear fuel enrichment facility. While reports of the effect of the worm on the facility and the resulting impact on Iran’s nuclear programme have differed wildly, a report by the Institute for Science and International Security detailing the effect of Stuxnet has concluded that while the effects of the worm were significant, the effect on Iran’s nuclear programme was only moderate:²⁸\n²⁵ Sharp, Cyberspace and the Use of Force, 129.\n²⁶ Ibid., 101–2.\n²⁷ The question of the cyber attacks acting as an indication of imminent armed attacks is addressed in the following section on anticipatory self-defence.\n²⁸ David Albright, Paul Brannan and Christina Walrond, Stuxnet Malware and Natanz: Update of ISIS December 22, 2010 Report, Institute for Science and International Security (2011) 3.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nARMED ATTACK AND RESPONSE IN THE DIGITAL AGE\nWhile it has delayed the Iranian Centrifuge program at the Natanz plant in 2010 and contributed to slowing its expansion, it did not stop it or even delay the continued build up of [low enriched uranium]\nThat being the case, it would appear that while the Stuxnet worm would undoubtedly amount to a use of force, the scale and effects of the attack do not appear to have sufficient gravity to amount to an armed attack.\n## 1.1. Anticipatory self-defence\nIt is likely that computer network attacks will be used in conjunction with, or as a prelude to, a traditional armed attack. Such attacks designed to 'prepare the battle space' can come in a myriad of forms, including the disablement of intelligence-gathering sensors such as satellites and radar posts via computer network attack, disruption of military communications networks leaving units isolated and unable to be scrambled, or, on the civilian level, disablement of emergency response networks may be launched in anticipation of more traditional kinetic action to follow. It is certainly clear that states are considering how a combination of electronic and traditional attacks might be used in the future. For example, the US actively looked for computer network solutions prior to the 2003 invasion of Iraq and China is openly looking for an 'assassin's mace' to address the perceived asymmetry of the Chinese military against the US in conventional conflicts, widely believed to incorporate computer network attacks.²⁹ As Robertson points out, in modern warfare the electronic battlefield will play a crucial role, and any steps that a prospective attacker can take to neutralise or destroy its enemy's command and control, intelligence, communications, or weapons-control networks prior to a traditional attack would gain an enormous advantage.³⁰ This advantage was seen in the 2007 Israeli attack on the suspected Syrian nuclear site where the air defence radar did not detect the attacking planes until they were disappearing back over the border.³¹ One might also look to the role of the distributed denial of service attacks against Georgia in 2008 which preceded the physical invasion by Russia. While such attacks may not be sufficient\n²⁹ David A. Fulghum, ‘Frustrations and Backlogs’, *Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology* 10, 10 March 2003, 33. According to reports these attempts were never put into action due to the interconnectedness of the target systems with foreign-owned networks.\n³⁰ Robertson, ‘Self-Defense against CNA’, 139.\n³¹ See Fulghum, Wall and Butler, ‘Israel Shows Electronic Prowess’.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nARMED ATTACK\nto amount to an armed attack in and of themselves, as preparatory moves in a conventional attack they may be sufficient to justify the use of force under the doctrine of anticipatory self-defence.\n## 1.1.1. Doctrinal debate and imminent attacks\nThere is no consensus in international legal doctrine over the point in time from which measures of self-defence against an armed attack may be taken.³² In particular, states and commentators are divided over whether a right of anticipatory self-defence exists in international law. The debate centres on whether anticipatory self-defence survived the implementation of Article 51 of the UN Charter, which states that nothing in the Charter ‘shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs’. Those arguing for a restrictive interpretation of the clause interpret this to mean that the right of self-defence is now only available to member states who are the object of an actual armed attack. Gray, Kelsen and Brownlie are some of the leading proponents of this view, which is based on the premise that the Charter forbids any use of force on the part of individual members except for the right of self-defence against an armed attack.³³\nThose arguing for a more expansive approach point out that Article 51 specifically reserves the ‘inherent right’ of self-defence, and the customary right includes the right to respond to an imminent armed attack.³⁴ Although ultimately disagreeing with the position, Bothe points out that many authors acknowledge that a threat may be so direct and overwhelming that it is just not feasible to require the victim to wait to act in self-defence until the act has actually started.³⁵ Other authors have addressed this problem by adopting a broader notion\n³² Randelzhofer, ‘Article 51’, 803.\n³³ Bowett, *Self-Defence*, 188. See also Brownlie, *Use of Force by States*, 275; Ian Brownlie, *International Law and the Use of Force by States: Revisited* (Europaeum, Oxford, 2001); Randelzhofer, ‘Article 51’, 803–4; Christine D. Gray, *International Law and the Use of Force* (3rd edn, Oxford University Press, 2008), 160; Dinstein, *War, Aggression, and Self-Defense*, 183.\n³⁴ Authors subscribing to this expansive view include Thomas M. Franck, *Recourse to Force: State Action against Threats and Armed Attacks* (Cambridge University Press, 2002), 97; Bowett, *Self-Defence*, 187–92; Christopher Greenwood, ‘International Law and the Pre-Emptive Use of Force: Afganistan, Al-Qaida, and Iraq’ (2003) 4 San Diego Int’l L.J. 7; Robert Y. Jennings and C. Arthur H. Watts (eds.), *Oppenheim’s International Law* (9th edn, Longman, Harlow, 1992), 421.\n³⁵ Michael Bothe, ‘Terrorism and the Legality of Pre-Emptive Force’ (2003) 14(2) EJIL 227, 231.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nARMED ATTACK AND RESPONSE IN THE DIGITAL AGE\nof when an armed attack has occurred in the context of Article 51. For example, while expressly rejecting the notion of anticipatory self-defence, Yoram Dinstein nevertheless incorporates actions taken in advance of an actual attack by moving the timing of the beginning of the attack, a concept he calls ‘interceptive’ self-defence.³⁶ Dinstein argues that the beginning of an armed attack is not linked to the first shot but rather to the moment of irrevocable commitment to the attack. Once the die has been cast, the armed attack can be said to have commenced and the victim state need not ‘wait impotently for the inescapable blow’.³⁷ This concept has echoes in the ‘target locking’ arguments of some states in respect of modern precision-guided missiles. For example, the US argues that an armed attack begins when the radar guiding the missile is locked on and ready to fire, and the rules of engagement of their armed forces reflect this approach.³⁸ Although, as Lindsay Moir points out, whether such an approach truly distinguishes between an armed attack which has begun but not yet reached the target state, and an armed attack that has not begun but is imminent, is open to question.³⁹\nThe standard to be applied for taking action in anticipation of an attack was set out by US Secretary of State Daniel Webster in his letter regarding the Caroline incident of 1837. In his now classic formulation, he stated that the right of self-defence only arises where there is ‘a necessity of self-defence, instant, overwhelming, leaving no choice of means, and no moment for deliberation’.⁴⁰ Christopher Greenwood\n³⁶ Dinstein, War, Aggression, and Self-Defense, 187.\n³⁷ Dinstein, ‘CNA and Self-Defense’, 111.\n³⁸ Gray, Use of Force (2nd edn), 108, n. 48. For example, in 1998 US aircraft in the no-fly zone over Iraq fired at a missile battery when its radar had locked on to the planes patrolling the zone. Although there was controversy over whether the radar had locked on, the idea that the armed attack had started when the radar locked on was apparently accepted by Iraq and other states: Keesings (1998) 42368.\n³⁹ Lindsay Moir, Reappraising the Resort to Force: International Law, Jus Ad Bellum and the War on Terror (Hart, Oxford, 2010), 16.\n⁴⁰ In that incident, UK forces captured, fired and sent over the Niagara Falls a merchant vessel called the Caroline which was being used by Canadian rebels and their American forces in attacks against passing British ships. At the time of the UK attack the ship was moored in an American port and two US nationals were killed. One of the British officers, Lieutenant McLeod, was later arrested in the United States on charges of murder arising out of the incident. The British government, seeking McLeod’s release, maintained that its forces had acted in self-defence, to which US Secretary of State Daniel Webster replied in what has become the accepted statement of self-defence doctrine at the time. The Caroline Case (1837) 29 BFSP 1137-8.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nARMED ATTACK\npoints out that the Caroline test was applied by the international military tribunals at Nuremburg and Tokyo, suggesting that the right to respond in self-defence against imminent attacks was part of the customary law right preserved by Article 51 of the Charter.⁴¹ The preservation of an inherent right of self-defence and the existence of customary rights outside the Charter wording is also recognised by the Court in the Nicaragua (Merits) case, which noted that the Charter does not contain all the rules pertaining to self-defence, notably a definition of armed attack and the requirement of necessity and proportionality in any response.⁴² The Court expressly did not comment on the lawfulness of an anticipatory response to an imminent armed attack as it was not required on the facts of the case.⁴³ The Court’s approach in avoiding the difficult questions of self-defence and expressly stating no view on anticipatory self-defence has been followed in both the Wall and Armed Activities cases.⁴⁴ Two recent UN reports have not been so reluctant, however. The 2004 report of the UN Secretary-General’s High Level Panel concluded that there was an existing right of anticipatory self-defence against imminent attacks, basing their conclusion on customary international law.⁴⁵ Likewise the Report of the Secretary-General the following year expresses the view that responses to imminent threats are fully covered by Article 51 of the Charter.⁴⁶\n## 1.1.2. State practice\nThe content of any customary right of anticipatory self-defence must be examined in light of state practice since the inception of the Charter. While state practice is far from conclusive on the matter, two instances in particular tend to indicate that the doctrine has survived. The first is the Israeli-Arab war of 1967. In the wake of escalating tensions between Syria and Israel, Egypt requested the removal of a United Nations emergency force from Egyptian territory, reinforced troops in the Sinai and dispatched troops to Jordan. Egyptian President Nasser also closed the Straits of Tiran to Israeli shipping (an act that Israel had\n⁴¹ Greenwood, ‘Pre-Emptive Use of Force’, 13.\n⁴² Nicaragua (Merits), para. 176.\n⁴³ Ibid., para. 194.\n⁴⁴ The Wall Case; Armed Activities Case, para. 143.\n⁴⁵ United Nations, A More Secure World: Our Shared Responsibility.

In response to these actions Israel launched strikes against Egypt's airbases, completely destroying the Egyptian air force.⁴⁷ Israel justified its actions in the Security Council by claiming that it had been attacked first, but also by reference to a series of acts of sabotage from Syria, and stressed both the character of the Egyptian blockade as an act of war and ‘perhaps more imminent than anything else, this vast and purposeful encirclement movement’ caused by the transfer of large numbers of Egyptian forces to their ‘very gates’.⁴⁸ Gray rejects this incident as evidence of an acceptance of anticipatory self-defence, stating that ‘whatever position is taken on the facts of the outbreak of the Six Day War, the point of importance here is that Israel did not claim to be acting in anticipatory self-defence’.⁴⁹ However, Franck notes that Israel’s ‘words and actions clearly asserted a right of anticipatory self-defence against an imminent armed attack’.⁵⁰ In emphasising the fact that neither the Security Council nor the General Assembly condemned Israel’s actions, Franck comments:⁵¹\nMost states, on the basis of the evidence available to them, did however conclude that such an armed attack was imminent, that Israel had reasonably surmised that it stood a better chance of survival if the attack were pre-empted, and that, therefore, in the circumstances, it had not acted unreasonably. This does not amount to an open-ended endorsement of a general right to anticipatory self-defense, but it does recognize that, in demonstrable circumstances of extreme necessity, anticipatory self-defense may be a legitimate exercise of a State’s right to ensure its survival.\nThis accords with the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice in the Nuclear Weapons case, which indirectly commented on the situation when the majority of judges were unable to conclude that the first use of nuclear weapons would invariably be unlawful if the very existence of the state were threatened.⁵²\n⁴⁷ For a full exposition of the facts of this incident see generally A.

In most cases the reaction was based on a conclusion that Israel had failed to demonstrate that there was an imminent threat from Iraq and had thus failed to satisfy the Caroline requirements for anticipatory self-defence rather than a general dismissal of a right of anticipatory self-defence.54 As Greenwood points out, the emphasis on this failure to demonstrate the existence of the imminent threat tends, if anything, to confirm the existence of a right of self-defence in cases where such an imminent threat was shown to exist.55 He goes on to cite Rosalyn Higgins, who notes:56\n[I]n a nuclear age, common sense cannot require one to interpret an ambiguous provision in a text in a way that requires a state passively to accept its fate before it can defend itself. And, even in the face of conventional warfare, this would also seem the only realistic interpretation of the contemporary right of self-defence. It is the potentially devastating consequences of prohibiting self-defence unless an armed attack has already occurred that leads one to prefer this interpretation – although it has to be said that, as a matter of simple construction of the words alone, another conclusion might be reached.\nIn assessing what will constitute an imminent attack, Greenwood argues that there are two additional factors which must be taken into account which did not exist at the time of the Caroline incident:57\nThe first is the gravity of the threat. The threat posed by a nuclear weapon, or a biological or chemical weapon, if used against a city, is so horrific that it is in a different league from the threats posed (as in the Caroline) by cross-border raids conducted by men armed only with rifles. Where the threat is an attack by weapons of mass destruction, the risk imposed upon a State by waiting until that attack actually takes place compounded by the impossibility for that State to afford its population any effective protection once the attack has been launched, mean that such an attack can reasonably be treated as imminent in circumstances where an attack by conventional means would not be so regarded. The second consideration is the method of delivery of the threat. It is far more difficult to determine the time scale within which a threat of\n53 SC Res 487, UN SCOR, 2288th Meeting, 19 June 1981, UN Doc.

These would be material considerations in assessing whether, in any particular case, an attack should be treated as imminent.\nAlthough the existence of a right of anticipatory self-defence remains controversial, it is the view of the present author that a right of self-defence against an imminent attack is established in customary international law. The idea of computer network attacks as an indicator of an imminent attack is discussed in the following section.\n### 1.1.3. Computer network attacks and anticipatory self-defence\nThere are two situations where anticipatory self-defence may be implicated in the information warfare context: first, where a computer network attack serves as an imminent threat of a conventional attack; and secondly, where electronic activity indicates a severe computer network attack (which rises to the level of an armed attack) is imminent.\nAs with any assessment of an imminent attack the context of a computer network attack must be taken into account. Where a computer network attack is launched as a precursor to conventional attack, the target will be important. If an attack targets early warning systems, radar posts or satellite feeds, military communications, or emergency response systems it is likely that a state will judge a traditional attack to be imminent. The Israeli attack against the Syrian air-defence network is a case in point. Had Syria become aware of the intrusion and manipulation of its air-defence radar prior to the attack, they would have been entitled to use force in response. Indeed most military forces would claim that the neutralisation of the air-defence network was the beginning of the attack itself, and would certainly be included under Dinstein’s interceptive self-defence analysis.\nThe disruption of electrical power grids or financial systems, on the other hand, is unlikely to be sufficiently indicative of a subsequent conventional attack when viewed in isolation. Thus when Estonia was subject to distributed denial of service attacks against its banking, media and governmental sites, there were no realistic fears that this signalled the beginning of a traditional armed attack. The additional variables, such as positive attribution to a particular actor and possible motivation, are too many and too varied. However, when such attacks are viewed in conjunction with other contextual indicators, states may be more likely to conclude that a conventional attack is imminent.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nARMED ATTACK\nThe 2008 conflict between Russia and Georgia over South Ossetia illustrates the dangers associated with such an attribution, however. That conflict took place in an atmosphere of increased tensions between the states and in the face of skirmishes between separatist forces and the Georgian military. Prior to the physical invasion, a series of distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks were launched against the Georgian government, and media targets and commentators have noted the close coordination between the targets of the computer network attacks in specific areas and the later physical strikes.58 While it is tempting to conclude that the computer network attacks were indicative of the imminent physical invasion, analysts agree that there is no link evident between the Russian government and the attacks, and that patriotic hackers were behind the electronic disruptions.59 Given the increasing frequency with which hacktivist groups launch such denial of service attacks to further their causes or protest political decisions, it seems unlikely that states will be able to rely on such attacks as indicators even, and perhaps especially, in times of increased political tension.\nThe second instance where a computer network attack may be evidence of an imminent armed attack is the use of computer network intrusions to prepare an electronic battlespace. Viruses, worms, Trojan horses and other forms of malware routinely infect unprotected computers with malicious code which may corrupt data, cause a malfunction, record keystrokes, disable virus protection and collect other information such as passwords and other access codes, feeding them back to a remote attacker. One of the most common features of these types of malware is some form of backdoor payload which allows the attacker to access and control the computer at a later date. Such malware is most often used to 'recruit' unprotected computers to vast networks of compromised computers called botnets. Usually used for spam or criminal enterprise, the controllers of the botnet can also use the command and control servers of the botnet to direct the sending of large amounts of traffic to particular IP addresses, bringing them, and\n58 See, for example, US Cyber Consequences Unit, Overview by the US-CCU of the Cyber Campaign against Georgia in August of 2008, US Cyber Consequences Unit (2009) www.registan.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/US-CCU-Georgia-Cyber-Campaign-Overview.pdf (last accessed 25 February 2011); Project Grey Goose, Phase I Report: Russia/Georgia Cyber War – Findings and Analysis (2008).\n59 US Cyber Consequences Unit, Overview; Project Grey Goose, Phase I Report; Tikk, Kaska and Vihul, Cyber Incidents, 66–79.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nARMED ATTACK AND RESPONSE IN THE DIGITAL AGE\nin some cases the transmission routes, to a standstill in a DDoS attack. Botnets have been utilised in most major DDoS attacks reported to date, including against Estonia in 2007 and Georgia in 2008.⁶⁰\nThe inclusion of backdoor payloads in malware raises interesting questions in relation to anticipatory self-defence.⁶¹ It is clear that a backdoor has no other purpose than to allow an intruder control over the infected computer (whether by direct intrusion or remote control) at a later date. A question which must then be addressed is whether a state has the right to respond in anticipatory self-defence against the perpetrators of a computer network attack with a backdoor payload. Although a backdoor can be used for attacks at any point until it is discovered and removed, and such attacks may have far more serious consequences, including those which would qualify as an armed attack, in most cases, the later use is to send spam or launch DDoS attacks causing inconvenience and only economic damage. Without further information about the purpose or target of any later attack, the mere creation of a backdoor by a state adversary is not indicative of the type or gravity of the attack to follow; indeed the creation of a backdoor may merely be evidence of espionage.⁶² Most importantly from a legal perspective, the existence of a backdoor would not meet the ‘imminent’ criteria for lawful self-defence, as the timescale for any subsequent attack is variable; the attack could be launched within days or years.\nOther network intrusions may more indicative, but they will be highly dependent on the circumstances. Two points deserve comment. First, the method of delivery means that there may be little warning of an impending computer network attack; this was one of Greenwood’s additional factors to be considered when determining whether an attack is imminent.⁶³ However, Greenwood’s second factor, the gravity of threat, will depend entirely on the individual threat; as pointed out in the previous chapter, one of the difficulties with assessing computer\n⁶⁰ See, for example, Gadi Evron, ‘Battling Botnets and Online Mobs’ (2008) 9(1) GJIA 121, 124; Tikk, Kaska and Vihul, Cyber Incidents.\n⁶¹ A backdoor is a piece of code which opens a hidden or undocumented access point to the compromised computer or system, bypassing the authentication and security protocols and allowing remote access.\n⁶² Backdoors have been found on computers allegedly compromised by Chinese hackers.\n⁶³ Greenwood, ‘Pre-Emptive Use of Force’, 16.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nARMED ATTACK\n91\nnetwork attacks is that they span the ‘spectrum of consequentiality’.64 While computer network attacks against critical infrastructure such as electricity grids, dams and oil pipelines would be devastating to modern society, and may result in death and property damage, to date no computer network attack has been launched that would be comparable to the threat posed by a nuclear, biological or chemical weapon. In this regard, with the very survival of the state not in question, it is unlikely that the threat would be assessed as imminent.\n## 1.1.4. The ‘Bush doctrine’ of pre-emptive self-defence65\nIn 2002 and 2006 the United States released two security strategy documents containing what appears to be a highly controversial attempt at enlarging the right to self-defence to include the use of force to preempt an attack which is merely threatened, but is not imminent. As Gray points out, there is some uncertainty as to the exact scope of the US claims; however, international criticism of the ‘Bush doctrine’ was both widespread and fierce.66 The 2002 National Security Strategy provided that:67\nWe must be prepared to stop rogue states and their terrorist clients before they are able to threaten or use weapons of mass destruction against the United States and our allies ...\n... Legal scholars and international jurists often conditioned the legitimacy of pre-emption on the existence of an imminent threat – most often a visible mobilization of armies, navies, and air forces preparing to attack.\nWe must adapt the concept of imminent threat to the capabilities and objectives of today’s adversaries ... The greater the threat, the greater is the risk of inaction – and the more compelling the case for taking anticipatory action to defend ourselves, even if uncertainty remains as to the time and place of the enemy’s attack. To forestall or prevent such hostile acts by our adversaries, the United States will, if necessary, act pre-emptively.\n64 Schmitt, ‘Normative Framework’, 912.\n65 This is also known as preventative or predictive self-defence in security studies circles. There is also much confusion in the legal literature regarding what exactly is being referred to by the terms anticipatory, pre-emptive and preventative self-defence.\n66 Gray, Use of Force (3rd edn), 211; Moir, Resort to Force, 79.\n67 White House, The National Security Strategy of the United States of America, White House, 2002), 15, www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/nss/nss_sep2002.pdf (last accessed 5 July 2011).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nARMED ATTACK AND RESPONSE IN THE DIGITAL AGE\nThe sentiments of the 2002 report are repeated in the National Security Strategy 2006.⁶⁸ While at first glance, this may appear to extrapolate logically based on the contingencies of modern weaponry, it compromises the basic premise of anticipatory self-defence laid down in the Caroline case and the evidence of state practice which has evolved the doctrine since. Greenwood has noted, far from removing the requirement of imminence ‘... practice also shows that the right of anticipatory self-defence is confined to instances where the armed attack is imminent’.⁶⁹ As noted above, while Greenwood accepts that the notion of imminence must take into account the gravity of the threat and its method of deliverance, he goes on to state: ‘In so far as talk of a doctrine of “pre-emption” is intended to refer to a broader right of self-defence to respond to threats that might materialize at some time in the future, such a doctrine has no basis in law.’⁷⁰ The issue has been debated extensively in the legal literature and will not be repeated here, save to say that state practice has not indicated widespread support for the doctrine, and both UN reports on security have rejected any wider right of pre-emptive self-defence, indicating it is for the Security Council to take pre-emptive action.⁷¹ In 2010 legal commentators watched with interest to see what the policy of the new US administration would be. However they were to be disappointed; while downplaying the idea of pre-emption, the Obama administration’s National Security Strategy 2010 does not dismiss it, merely stating that states must ‘adhere to standards that govern the use of force’ without elaborating further on what those standards might be.⁷² The relevance of this apparent\n⁶⁸ White House, National Security Strategy of the United States of America (White House, 2006), 23. Although Gray notes the striking absence of any express reference to international law, the 2006 report does state that ‘the United States will, if necessary, act pre-emptively in exercising our inherent right of self-defense’, most likely an implicit reference to Art. 51 of the Charter: Christine D.

Pinprick attacks or accumulation of events theory\nComputer network attacks falling below the armed attack threshold may still trigger a forcible response by states. The most likely strategy utilising computer network attacks is to launch a swarm of lesser attacks, rather than a single large strike qualifying as an armed attack. In a short story published in 1998, John Arquilla detailed what a sustained cyber attack might look like:77 power blackouts, followed by weekly virus attacks of the magnitude of the Nimda, Slammer or Mydoom viruses, oil pipeline ruptures all launched within a matter of days of one another. While some of these attacks may cross the threshold of uses of force under Article 2(4), it is unlikely that any taken on their own would be considered an armed attack under current international law. An analogy may be drawn with cases of repeated cross-border incursions. States have claimed a right to act in self-defence\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nARMED ATTACK AND RESPONSE IN THE DIGITAL AGE\nagainst a series of small-scale incursions or attacks as collectively amounting to a single armed attack. The ‘pinprick’ or ‘accumulation of events’ theory has been unsuccessfully argued in the past by several states, including the United Kingdom,⁷⁸ the United States,⁷⁹ South Africa and Israel,⁸⁰ in an attempt to justify actions purportedly taken in self-defence, that might otherwise be disproportionate. Although the Security Council rejected the claims by these states, each time it has done so on the specific facts of the case and on grounds that such actions were disproportionate. In each instance the condemnation by the Security Council suggested that the actions were unlawful reprisals, rather than commenting on the doctrinal issue of the scope of self-defence.⁸¹ Likewise, the International Court of Justice has avoided expressly discussing the issue, although it appears willing to contemplate the possibility of an accumulation of events amounting to an armed attack. The Court in the Nicaragua (Merits) case commented with regard to the incursions by Nicaragua into the territory of Honduras and Costa Rica:⁸²\nVery little information is available to the Court as to the circumstances of these incursions or to their possible motivations, which renders it difficult to decide whether they may be treated for legal purposes as amounting, singly or collectively, to an ‘armed attack’ by Nicaragua on either or both States.\n⁷⁸ In 1964 the Southern Arab Federation (SAF) which had military links with the United Kingdom, complained of an armed attack by the Yemen which consisted of a ‘series of aggressions’; invoking collective self-defence at the SAF’s request, the UK launched an air strike and destroyed a fort. The Security Council did not accept the reasoning and issued a statement condemning reprisals as ‘incompatible with the principles and purposes of the UN’. SC Res 188, 9 April 1964, as cited in Jean Combacau, ‘The Exception of Self Defence in U.N Practice’ in A. Cassese (ed.), The Current Legal Regulation of the Use of Force (Martinus Nijhoff, Dordrecht, 1986) 9–38, 27.\n⁷⁹ The US claimed it was acting in self-defence against alleged attacks by North Vietnamese naval vessels in the Gulf of Tonkin.

See ibid.\n⁸¹ Gray, Use of Force (3rd edn), 155.\n⁸² Nicaragua (Merits), para. 231. It should be noted that the Court found that there had not been an armed attack by Nicaragua based on additional circumstances.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSELF-DEFENCE AGAINST NON-STATE ACTORS\n95\nThis statement would seem to indicate a willingness on the part of the Court to consider that a series of small-scale attacks on a target may amount to an armed attack when viewed collectively. This view is reiterated in the Oil Platforms, Cameroon/Nigeria and Armed Activities (DRC v. Uganda) cases.⁸³ In all three cases, while not expressly discussing the doctrine, the Court appears to permit the concept of an armed attack through cumulative attacks; however, the Court found that neither the United States, Cameroon nor Uganda respectively had sufficiently proved the facts or imputability to the other party.⁸⁴ This doctrine has obvious application for the victims of protracted campaigns involving low-intensity computer network attacks. However, as with their conventional equivalents, the devil will be in the detail, conclusively proving that the attribution of computer network attacks is a notoriously difficult and time-consuming task.⁸⁵\nOne final point should be noted: not all attacks which are launched from multiple computers will require a cumulative approach to qualify as an armed attack. A DDoS attack of sufficient scale and effect to elevate it above a ‘mere frontier incident’ would be considered a single attack as the attack originates from a single controller.⁸⁶ That is, although the attack appears to come from large numbers of computers in disparate locations, the compromised computers all receive their attack and targeting instructions via command and control servers manipulated from a single controlling ‘master’ which directs the botnet.⁸⁷ This is merely the electronic equivalent of an attack using more than one soldier, or a wave of bombers in an air strike.\n## 2. Self-defence against non-state actors\nOne of the most difficult issues in contemporary jus ad bellum is the permitted response of states to attacks by non-state actors. The difficulty\n⁸³ Case Concerning the Land and Maritime Boundary between Cameroon and Nigeria (Cameroon v. Nigeria: Equatorial Guinea Invervening) (2002) ICJ Reports, International Court of Justice, para. 323; Oil Platforms Case, para. 64; Armed Activities Case, para. 146.\n⁸⁴ Oil Platforms Case, para. 64.\n⁸⁵ See section 3, below.\n⁸⁶ For a detailed description of DDoS attacks, see Bennett Todd, Distributed Denial of Service Attacks (2000), www.linuxsecurity.com/resource_files/intrusion_detection/ddos-faq.html (last accessed 12 April 2011).\n⁸⁷ In traditional botnets this is generally through an Internet Relay Chat (IRC) Server. In newer peer-to-peer based botnets, such as the Storm worm, the controller publishes commands at specific keys in the network to be found by infected machines. However, the net result is the same.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nARMED ATTACK AND RESPONSE IN THE DIGITAL AGE\nstems in part from the fact that Article 2(4) and Article 51 do not entirely correspond in their wording.⁸⁸ As has been noted above, Article 2(4) applies only in the international relations between states and thus does not apply to non-state actors; conversely, Article 51 refers to an inherent right of self-defence which is triggered ‘if an armed attack occurs’, with no mention of by whom the attack has been launched. Those arguing for a restricted right point to Article 51’s role as an exception to the prohibition contained in Article 2(4) to argue that it should likewise be constrained to armed attacks by states. Those, including the present author, who consider there is a broader right of self-defence point to state practice, the fact that Article 51 reflects an ‘inherent right’ rather than establishing one, and the recognition by the International Court of Justice in the Nicaragua (Merits) case that the Charter by no means reflects the whole of the body of law governing force.⁸⁹\nAs noted above, the International Court of Justice in its controversial decision in the Nicaragua (Merits) case, has addressed the issue of when a state might be held responsible for indirect military action by rebels acting ‘on behalf’ of a foreign state, establishing the test of ‘effective control’.⁹⁰ For computer network attacks, where attribution is one of the major problems, this test will prove particularly difficult to satisfy and commentators have been quick to point out the advantages that such plausible deniability will offer to sending states. However, the question of whether a state has a right to respond with force to an armed attack by a non-state actor absent a degree of state complicity has proved a far more difficult question, and one on which the International Court of Justice has been reluctant to comment. The issue has been covered extensively in recent legal literature, and it is not proposed to conduct a full survey of the arguments here, other than to note that there appears to be a divergence between the limited jurisprudence of the Court and emerging state practice on the issue.⁹¹\nIt is safe to say that the Court’s treatment of the matter has caused more confusion than clarification. In its advisory opinion on the Wall, in a statement described as both ‘opaque’ and ‘startling in its\n⁸⁸ Moir, Resort to Force, 22.\n⁸⁹ For the latter point see Nicaragua (Merits), para. 176.\n⁹⁰ Although note also the alternate test established by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia in the Tadic case which specified an ‘effective control’ test.\n⁹¹ For a full discussion of the issues, see, for example, Gray, Use of Force (3rd edn); Moir, Resort to Force.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSELF-DEFENCE AGAINST NON-STATE ACTORS\n97\nbrevity',92 the Court stated that ‘Article 51 of the Charter thus recognises the existence of an inherent right of self-defence in the case of armed attack by one State against another State. However Israel does not claim that the attacks against it are imputable to a foreign State.’93 The Court goes on to note that the threat to which Israel is responding emanates from territory which is controlled by Israel. Although some commentators have taken this to mean that there is no right of self-defence against non-state actors, Gray has argued that this is merely a statement of the basic right of self-defence and that the Court does not say this is the only time there is a right to self-defence.94 The Court once again had an opportunity to consider the right of states to use force against attacks by non-state actors in the Armed Activities case between DRC and Uganda. The Court, however, chose to limit itself strictly to a discussion of the attributability of the acts complained of to a state – applying the Nicaragua test – and expressly declined to discuss the issue of ‘whether and under what conditions contemporary international law provides for a right of self defence against large-scale attacks by irregular forces’.95 However, as Moir has pointed out, by deciding that Uganda’s actions could not amount to self-defence as the attacks complained of could not be attributed to the DRC, they effectively answered the question in the negative in any case.96\nSurveys of state practice, on the other hand, tend to suggest a much greater willingness on the part of the international community to accept the possibility of self-defence against armed attacks by non-state actors without attribution to a state.97 Moir notes, however, that a certain level of support and involvement on the part of the state is required, and is consistently asserted by states claiming the right.98 Thomas Franck suggests that measures taken in self-defence against non-state actors will be accepted by the international community where victim states have identified correctly the place from where it was attacked, that the authorities in that place deliberately, knowingly\n92 Gray, Use of Force (3rd edn); Sean D.

First, as discussed in section 3 below, correctly identifying and attributing an attack to a particular perpetrator in a timely manner is one of the most difficult problems in the field of computer network attacks, both from a technical standpoint and a legal one. To be able to do so in a manner that is clear and verifiable by the international community so as to back a claim for the legitimate exercise of self-defence will be an added level of difficulty. Second, even once computer forensics have established the origins of the attacks, proving a sufficient level of support and involvement by a state will be difficult. For example, the computer network attacks against Georgia demonstrated a high level of coordination between the cyber attacks launched by ‘patriotic hackers’ and the military operations carried out by Russia. Russia has denied any involvement with the attacks, and no evidence has been found of state organisations guiding or directing the attacks ‘be it because there was none, because the collection efforts were not far-reaching or deep enough to identify those connections, or because involvement by state organisations was conducted in a way to purposefully avoid attribution’.¹⁰⁰ There was certainly not enough to prove involvement of the Russian authorities in any official capacity,¹⁰¹ particularly absent the context of the military operations.¹⁰² In addition, states will find it very difficult to prevent or even be aware of computer network attacks emanating from their territory, particularly given the high prevalence of technologies such as proxy servers.\nThe final factor raised by Franck in determining whether the international community is likely to accept a claim by a state acting in self-defence against a non-state actor is the proportionality of the response. The question of proportionality is discussed in section 4 below; however, there are a few issues which pertain specifically to non-state actors. First, states have been quick to condemn actions\n⁹⁹ Franck, Recourse to Force, 68.\n¹⁰⁰ Project Grey Goose, Phase I Report, 3.\n¹⁰¹ Some investigators provided circumstantial evidence of possible involvement by individual officials within the Russian administration; however, many experts remain sceptical of these claims. See generally Tikk, Kaska and Vihul, Cyber Incidents, 74–6.\n¹⁰² It will be recalled that the computer network attacks began prior to the physical invasion and continued after the ceasefire.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nATTRIBUTION\npurportedly taken in self-defence which have targeted the infrastructure of the host state.¹⁰³ Given that most computer network attacks by non-state actors utilise this infrastructure, it may prove difficult for victim states to find an acceptable target. Secondly, the dispersed nature of many computer network attacks means that the non-state actors responsible for the attack may be resident in several different host states, complicating the proportionality assessment of any forcible response. It should be noted, however, that the most obvious example of such a dispersed attack, the DDoS attack, would rarely rise to the level of gravity required for an armed attack, absent involvement in a wider programme of attacks that could be responded to under the doctrine of accumulation of events.\nOne final point deserves comment: computer network attacks may also provide a unique opportunity for states to take action against non-state actors without violating the territorial integrity of the state from which they are acting; however, non-state actors are less likely to have infrastructure that would provide viable targets for forcible computer network attacks.¹⁰⁴\n# 3. Attribution\nOne of the major problems with any computer network attack is the attribution of the attack to a particular actor. While the origin of some attacks becomes immediately evident, either because the attacker identifies themselves,¹⁰⁵ or because they precede traditional attacks that are easily attributed to a particular source,¹⁰⁶ other attacks will be launched anonymously. Given the common use of botnets and the frequency of IP spoofing that takes place in computer network attacks,¹⁰⁷\n¹⁰³ See, for example, the international condemnation of the Israeli attacks against Lebanon in 2006 in response to attacks by Hezbollah, and also the comment of the ICJ in the Armed Activities case that the taking of airports and towns many kilometres away from the site of the series of transborder attacks complained of did not seem proportionate: Armed Activities Case, para. 147.\n¹⁰⁴ See, for example, the opinion of Judge Higgins in the Wall case, dissenting on the grounds that non-forcible measures such as the construction of a wall do not really fall within the concept of self-defence.\n¹⁰⁵ For example, the 'I Love You' virus source code contained the 'signature' of the author.\n¹⁰⁶ For example, the Israeli attack on the Syrian air-defences in advance of an air strike.\n¹⁰⁷ IP spoofing essentially forges the data identifying the sending computer in the header of a data packet so that it appears to originate from a different IP address, thus any response is sent to the forged computer.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nARMED ATTACK AND RESPONSE IN THE DIGITAL AGE\nit is difficult to state with any certainty that the entity that appears to be the perpetrator of the attack is in fact the ultimate attacker.\nIP spoofing can be used either to simply mask the origin of an attack, or in a deliberate attempt to place the blame for an attack on another party. An early example of the latter problem occurred in 1999 when a denial of service attack was launched against the US Department of Transport. The attack appeared to emanate from a server in Maryland run by followers of the Falun Gong movement; in fact, the attack was designed to take down both the Maryland server and the Department of Transport network server, leaving the Falun Gong bearing the blame. However, the attackers had blundered and the attack was traced to a computer located at the address of China's Ministry of Public Security. No information is publicly available regarding the US response to this attack; however, in 2002 Richard Clarke, then White House technology advisor, stated before a Senate Judiciary subcommittee hearing on cyber terrorism that the government had never been able to prove to their satisfaction that a particular government was responsible for a specific unauthorised intrusion.[108]\nThe proliferation of botnets also makes attribution difficult. As the 2007 denial of service attacks against Estonia proved, it can be very difficult to differentiate between attacks that originate from a particular address and those which are merely utilising a compromised computer. Although some of the IP addresses involved in the attacks against Estonia were traced to official IP addresses of Russian state authorities, Russia denied any involvement and claimed that these computers had been compromised and were being manipulated from outside the Kremlin. Subsequent reports by cyber security analysts tend to back this claim, pointing to the lack of evidence and also noting the possibility of spoofing the IP address of the attacker.[109]\nOf course, problems of attribution aren't restricted to cyberspace. Armed attacks following more conventional patterns are often carried out anonymously, or responsibility is claimed by armed groups which appear unlikely to have the resources required for such an attack. Further, in the case of state-sponsored terrorism, it is unlikely that any state will step forward to take responsibility for kinetic acts, let alone electronic ones. Those factors aside, a victim state must still establish\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nATTRIBUTION\na link between the attacking group and the sponsoring state, the same approach must be taken with electronic attacks.¹¹⁰ This may be particularly difficult to prove where attacks are launched by groups or loose affiliations of individuals in conjunction with traditional state action. For example, when Russia moved troops into South Ossetia following the Georgian offensive in 2008, the air strikes and ground forces were accompanied by a series of computer network attacks against Georgian servers. While these attacks were certainly not serious enough to amount to armed attacks, given Georgia's limited internet connectivity, they illustrate the capacity for other actors to effectively 'join-in' a conflict with or without state authorisation. Several security analysts reported botnets allegedly controlled by the Russian Business Network, a group known to be linked to cyber crime, launching denial of service attacks at Georgian servers. However, software was also freely available for download to individual computers from Russian language websites such as 'stopgeorgia.ru' along with a list of targets, making joining the cyber offensive as simple as a few mouse clicks.¹¹¹ As noted previously, the Russian government denies any involvement with the attacks;¹¹² however, the issue raises the difficult question of state responsibility for non-state actors and the necessity or degree of state involvement or complicity required before force can be used in self-defence against the state. This book does not address this issue in depth; suffice it to note that there is little agreement in the international community on the issue in relation to conventional attacks, let alone computer network attacks.¹¹³ However, it is clear that a state must not knowingly allow its territory to be used as a sanctuary for terrorists or armed bands bent on attacking military targets or civilian objects in another country.¹¹⁴\nThe difficulty of attribution also affects the victim state's ability to engage in forcible countermeasures in self-defence.¹¹⁵ The Court in the\n¹¹⁰ Dinstein, 'CNA and Self-Defense', 112.\n¹¹¹ John Markoff, 'Before the Gunfire, Cyberattacks', New York Times, 13 August 2008; Evgeny Morozov, 'An Army of Ones and Zeroes: How I Became a Soldier in the Georgia-Russia Cyberwar', Slate, 14 August 2008, www.slate.com/id/2197514/ (last accessed 12 April 2011).\n¹¹² Siobhan Gorman, 'Georgia States Computers Hit by Cyberattack', Wall Street Journal (New York), 12 August 2008, A9.\n¹¹³ For a discussion of legal attribution and state responsibility for non-state actors' use of force see generally Gray, Use of Force (2nd edn).\n¹¹⁴ Ian Brownlie, 'International Law and the Activities of Armed Bands' (1958) 7 International and Comparative Law Quarterly 712, 734, cited in Dinstein, War, Aggression, and Self-Defense, 206.\n¹¹⁵ Sharp, Cyberspace and the Use of Force, 133, cited in Dinstein, 'CNA and Self-Defense', 111.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nARMED ATTACK AND RESPONSE IN THE DIGITAL AGE\nOil Platforms case held that the burden of proof rests on the state invoking the right of self-defence and that the United States had failed to prove that it had been subject to an armed attack by a particular state, vis Iran.¹¹⁶ ‘[A victim state] must not rush headlong into hasty action predicated on reflexive impulses and unfounded suspicions; it has no choice but to withhold forcible response until hard evidence is collated and the state of affairs is clarified, lest the innocent be endangered.’¹¹⁷ Such hasty reactions could lead to the escalation of hostilities, something the ban on force was intended to prevent. However, the necessity of waiting for hard evidence of responsibility also opens the possibility that any action taken against a perpetrator once responsibility has been confirmed will be classified as an armed reprisal rather than an action taken in self-defence. Armed reprisals are prohibited under international law.¹¹⁸\n## 4. Necessity and proportionality\nAll responses to attacks, whether their means of delivery are kinetic or electronic, are subject to the underlying principles of necessity and proportionality. The International Court of Justice has repeatedly confirmed that self-defence, whether individual or collective, warrants only those measures which are ‘proportional to the armed attack and necessary to respond to it’ as a principle well established in customary international law.¹¹⁹ The principles are not stated in UN Charter but are often traced back to the Webster formulation in the Caroline incident.¹²⁰\nThe principle of necessity requires that any measures taken avowedly in self-defence must have been necessary for that purpose; the principle is strict and objective ‘leaving no room for any measure of discretion’.¹²¹ That is, it is not sufficient that force is used after an armed attack; it must be necessary to repel that attack,¹²² and non-forcible remedies must either prove futile in limine or have in fact been exhausted in an\n¹¹⁶ Oil Platforms Case, paras 57, 61.\n¹¹⁷ Dinstein, ‘CNA and Self-Defense’, 111.\n¹¹⁸ Declaration on Friendly Relations, Principle on the Use of Force, para. 6.\n¹¹⁹ Nicaragua (Merits), paras 176 and 194; Nuclear Weapons Case, para. 41; Oil Platforms Case, para. 74; Armed Activities Case, para. 147.\n¹²⁰ There must be ‘a necessity of defence, instant, overwhelming, leaving no choice of means and no moment for deliberation’.\n¹²¹ Oil Platforms Case, para. 73.\n¹²² Greenwood, ‘Pre-Emptive Use of Force’, 23.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nNECESSITY AND PROPORTIONALITY\n103\nunsatisfactory manner.¹²³ As Roberto Ago notes, ‘had [the state] been able to achieve the same result by measures not involving the use of armed force, it would have no justification for adopting conduct which contravened the general prohibition against the use of armed force’.¹²⁴ For example, in the *Oil Platforms Case* the Court noted that even if the attacks on the *Sea Isle City* and mining of the *Samuel B. Roberts* had been sufficiently imputed to Iran, the US had not complained to Iran of the military activities of the platforms, which suggested that the attacks on the platforms was not seen as a necessary act.¹²⁵\nThe principle of necessity also gives rise to a related principle, namely that actions taken in self-defence must generally be taken without undue delay.¹²⁶ In the case of computer network attacks, this may make successful claims of self-defence more difficult. Where the origins of a computer network attack are not obvious, the time taken to conduct computer forensics and establish hard evidence of the identity of the perpetrator may militate against a finding that any subsequent action by the victim state is in self-defence. Similar criticisms were levelled at the United States after a delay of several weeks between the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon and subsequent action in Afghanistan.¹²⁷ Likewise, the Court in the *Nicaragua (Merits)* case also criticised the US for commencing activities purportedly in self-defence several months after the major offensive of the opposition against the government of El Salvador had been completely repulsed, although ultimately dismissing the claim of self-defence on other grounds.¹²⁸ However, Dinstein notes that this requirement must not be construed too strictly; he points to the delay of approximately five months between the invasion of Kuwait and the authorisation of all necessary means by the Security Council.¹²⁹\nThe principle of proportionality requires the weighing of the response against its permitted purpose of halting and repelling the attack, or, in the case of anticipatory self-defence, preventing it from\n¹²³ Dinstein, ‘CNA and Self-Defense’, 109.\n¹²⁴ Roberto Ago, ‘Addendum to the Eighth Report on State Responsibility’ (1980) II UN Y.B.

Whether or not an act is proportionate will necessarily be dependent on the facts of the situation; however, the action must not be retaliatory or punitive, its lawfulness cannot be measured ‘except by its capacity for achieving the desired result’.¹³⁰ This raises an interesting question with respect to computer network attacks; namely whether it would ever be proportionate to use traditional armed force against an electronic attack. The answer must surely be in the affirmative. Proportionality does not restrict the defending state to the same weapons or the same numbers of armed forces as the attacking state; nor is it necessarily limited to action on its own territory.¹³¹ Therefore it would be open to the victim of a computer network attack to use whatever weapons it has at its disposal to repel the attack, as long as the response is proportionate to that purpose. As Ago notes:¹³²\nIn the case of self-defence, it was essential to avoid the error of thinking that there should be some proportionality between the action of the aggressor and the action of the state defending itself. Proportionality could be judged only in terms of the objective of the action, which was to repel an attack and prevent it from succeeding. No limitations that might prejudice the success of a response to attack could be placed on the State suffering the attack. The concept of reasonable action must of course enter into the matter, since self-defence could not justify a genuine act of aggression committed in response to an armed attack of limited proportions.\nThus, if a computer network attack is being used to prepare the battlespace for a conventional attack, the use of military force in response must be proportionate in relation to the need to repel the attack as a whole. However, it should be noted that while physically bombing the attacking computers and their owners may be legal, it is not necessarily the preferred method of response.¹³³ Only a few examples of state intrusion have been made public to date, and no large-scale attacks as would justify a forcible response have been reported. Further, state practice in response to electronic probes emanating from other states have not resulted in forcible responses.¹³⁴\n¹³⁰ Ago, ‘Addendum’, 69 para. 121.\n¹³¹ Gray, *Use of Force* (3rd edn), 150.\n¹³² Roberto Ago, ‘State Responsibility’ (1980) Vol. 1 *UN Y.B.

For example, the attack on the US Department of Transport that was attributed to the Falun Gong originated elsewhere, and despite initial accusations against Russia, the attacks on Estonia and Georgia are now widely believed to be the work of independent ‘patriotic hackers’. As noted, routing attacks through other actors, or spoofing their IP addresses to cast blame may serve as a political end in itself.\n## 5. Countermeasures against unlawful acts\nWhere a computer network attack does not rise to the level of an armed attack, a state may still respond with proportionate countermeasures. However, where forcible countermeasures are taken in response to an ordinary breach of international law, not constituting an armed attack, they are unlawful.¹³⁶\nHowever, an alternate line of reasoning, arising out of the controversial gap theory put forward by the majority of the International Court of Justice in the Nicaragua (Merits) decision, appears to have muddied the waters somewhat. The Court held that acts committed by Nicaragua against El Salvador, Honduras and Costa Rica amounted to less grave forms of ‘illegal military intervention’.¹³⁷ The Court held that that ‘proportionate counter-measures’ were permissible on the part of the victim state; however, they did not create any entitlement by any third state to take collective countermeasures involving the use\nHezbollah telecommunications network. The response was condemned by states; however, given the non-international nature of the dispute, it does not provide any useful indication of state practice in this regard. See generally ‘Hezbollah Takes over West Beirut’, BBC News, 9 May 2008, http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/7391600.stm (last accessed 15 July 2011).\n¹³⁵ Jensen, ‘Computer Attacks’, 231.\n¹³⁶ Dinstein, War, Aggression, and Self-Defense, 226.\n¹³⁷ The Court held that Nicaragua did supply aid to rebels in the territories of El Salvador, but had insufficient evidence of the nature, scale and continuance of such aid. The Court further held that Nicaragua was responsible for certain transborder military incursions into Honduras and Costa Rica. Nicaragua (Merits), paras 152, 164.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nARMED ATTACK AND RESPONSE IN THE DIGITAL AGE\nof force.¹³⁸ The Court did not venture an opinion as to what form the individual countermeasures by the victim state might take, or whether they could include the use of force.\nJohn Hargrove has suggested that there are two possible interpretations of the Court’s statement. Either the Court was saying:¹³⁹\n(a) that there are some acts of force that nobody, not even the victim, may resist by proportionate measures of force; or it was saying (b) that the victim may resist with force provided that it does so alone. There is little to be said in explanation of the latter proposition other than it is simply a[n] ... arbitrary announcement of the Court.\nHargrove argues that allowing forcible countermeasures ‘would in one remarkable stroke manage both to impair the right of self-defense, and to weaken fundamentally the prohibition on the use of force by creating an open-ended and wholly new category of exceptions to Article 2(4) of the Charter, of unknown content and limit.’¹⁴⁰ However, Judge Simma in his separate opinion in the *Oil Platforms* case has argued that the Court in the *Nicaragua (Merits)* case cannot, in the context of that case, have understood that to mean mere pacific reprisals.¹⁴¹ He argues that the Court can only have meant ‘defensive military action “short of” full-scale self-defence’.¹⁴²\nBut we may encounter also a lower level of hostile military action, not reaching the threshold of an ‘armed attack’ within the meaning of Article 51 of the United Nations Charter. Against such hostile acts, a state may of course defend itself, but only within a more limited range and quality of responses (the main difference being that the possibility of collective self-defence does not arise, cf. *Nicaragua*) and bound to necessity, proportionality and immediacy in time in a particularly strict way.\nSimma’s treatment of the conditions in respect of forcible countermeasures is clearly linked to the classic self-defence analysis, rather\n¹³⁸ ‘[A] use of force of a lesser degree of gravity cannot ... produce any entitlement to take collective counter-measures involving the use of force. The acts of which Nicaragua is accused ... could only have justified proportionate counter-measures on the part of the state which had been the victim of these acts, namely El Salvador, Honduras or Costa Rica. They could not justify counter-measures taken by a third state, the United States, and particularly could not justify intervention involving the use of force.’ *Ibid.*, para. 249.\n¹³⁹ Hargrove, *Nicaragua Judgement*, 141.\n¹⁴⁰ *Ibid.*, 142.\n¹⁴¹ *Oil Platforms Case* (per Judge Simma), para. 12.\n¹⁴² *Ibid.*, per Judge Simma, paras 12–13.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOUNTERMEASURES AGAINST UNLAWFUL ACTS\n107\nthan the criteria for non-forcible countermeasures set out below. This argument may prove beneficial to a state which is subjected to computer network attacks that rise to the level of force, particularly where it is unsure whether its planned proportionate response might likewise be considered an illegal use of force. It should be noted, however, that this is a minority view and that most commentators maintain that forcible countermeasures are prohibited under international law as armed reprisals.\nWhere a computer network attack does not amount to an armed attack (or a use of force), any countermeasures taken by the victim state will be conditional on, and limited by, the law relating to countermeasures.¹⁴³ In the Case Concerning the Gabcikovo-Nagymaros Project, the International Court of Justice set out a three-part test justifying proportionate countermeasures. First, the action must be taken in response to an internationally wrongful act of another state and be directed against that state. Second, the victim state must have called upon the offending state to discontinue its wrongful conduct or to make reparation for it. And finally, the effects of the countermeasure must be commensurate with the injury suffered, taking account of the rights in question.¹⁴⁴ In this regard the test for proportionality differs between countermeasures and self-defence, where the response must be proportional to the threat, rather than the actual harm suffered. However, the Court also stated that the purpose of the countermeasures must be to induce the wrongdoing state to comply with its obligations under international law, and that the measure must therefore be reversible.¹⁴⁵ In respect of a computer network attack this would seem to fit with current state practice; most attacks to date have merely resulted in states requesting the alleged perpetrator of the attack to cease their actions.¹⁴⁶ However, the nature of computer network attacks, including the type of attacks they make possible and, most importantly, their ability to be reversed, makes computer network attacks particularly useful as a countermeasure against a previous wrongful act of a state. For example, a series\n¹⁴³ See generally United Nations, International Law Commission and James Crawford, The International Law Commission's Articles on State Responsibility: Introduction, Text, and Commentaries (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, New York, 2002).\n¹⁴⁴ Case Concerning the Gabcikovo-Nagymaros Project (1997) ICJ Reports 3, International Court of Justice, para. 85.\n¹⁴⁵ Ibid., para. 87.\n¹⁴⁶ Although it should be noted that in all reported cases to date the suspected perpetrator has denied any involvement with the attack.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nARMED ATTACK AND RESPONSE IN THE DIGITAL AGE\nof blackouts in response to an internationally wrongful act may be a useful coercive measure.\nThe 1998 Zapatista ‘Floodnet’ attacks on the Pentagon’s website by the Electronic Disturbance Theatre also provide a model for how electronic countermeasures might work against non-state actors. US Department of Defense specialists created a program that would recognise the Floodnet applet installed on computers trying to access the Department of Defense website.¹⁴⁷ Once the applet was identified, a program was sent back to the activist’s computer to shut down their web browser, thus ending the attack.¹⁴⁸ Although criticisms were levelled at the Department for not thoroughly considering the legal ramifications of such a response,¹⁴⁹ the United States’ decision to respond electronically, in this instance, against an attack which they had been expecting, must be considered a proportionate countermeasure, particularly against a demonstrably non-violent protest group. There was some speculation that this approach was being renewed by the US Department of Defense in its ‘active defence’ policy released in 2011;¹⁵⁰ statements made by Lynn prior to release of the policy indicated that the US intended to stop threats before they reached Department of Defense networks. However, the unclassified version of the Pentagon’s cyber-security strategy appears to focus the concept of active defence on network speed hunting for malicious activity within Department of Defense networks and systems, rather than pushing back beyond the network boundaries.¹⁵¹ The danger with adopting the push-back approach against states is the risk of escalation of such countermeasures into forcible responses, a situation which the Security Council would be likely to determine a threat to international peace and security, as seen in the following section.\n¹⁴⁷ An applet is a small piece of code designed to perform one specific task within another application.\n¹⁴⁸ Brian Friel, ‘DoD Launches Internet Counterattack’, Government Executive, 18 September 1998, http://govexec.com/dailyfed/0998/091898b1.htm (last accessed 12 April 2011).\n¹⁴⁹ George I.

Security Council authorisation and collective measures\nOther than self-defence under Article 51, the only other exception to the prohibition on the use of force under the UN Charter is the authorisation of collective security measures under Chapter VII. The Security Council has ‘primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security’ and may recommend or authorise member states to engage in measures, which may include the use of force, in order to pursue this aim. Article 39 provides:\nThe Security Council shall determine the existence of any threat to the peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression and shall make recommendations, or decide what measures shall be taken in accordance with Articles 41 and 42, to maintain or restore international peace and security.\nThis raises two separate issues for the use of computer network attacks. First, when will the Security Council consider computer network attacks to be a ‘threat to the peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression’; and second, under what circumstances might measures authorised by the Security Council under Chapter VII include computer network attacks?\nAs noted, prior to the Security Council recommending action, it must determine that a ‘threat to the peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression’ exists under Article 39. In practice, the Council has almost exclusively exercised its powers by finding a ‘threat to international peace and security’, even in situations where a breach of the peace or act of aggression is obvious;¹⁵² thus the analysis will concentrate on this broader standard. Whether or not there are any limits on the Security Council’s ability to determine a threat to the peace is the subject of debate amongst legal scholars;¹⁵³ however, it is generally accepted that the Council possesses considerable discretion in this respect. The resulting range of situations in which the Security Council has found a threat to the peace is increasingly broad and includes the danger of violent countermeasures by states to violations of international law, regardless of their admissibility.¹⁵⁴ The Council has also\n¹⁵² Jochen Frowein, ‘Article 39’ in B.

All instances in which the Security Council has found an act of aggression or breach of the peace have involved inter-state conflicts.\n¹⁵³ See generally Erika De Wet, The Chapter VII Powers of the United Nations Security Council (Hart, Oxford, 2004), 133-4.\n¹⁵⁴ Frowein, ‘Article 39’, 722.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nARMED ATTACK AND RESPONSE IN THE DIGITAL AGE\nfound threats to the peace in internal conflicts such as those in Liberia, Rwanda, Sierra Leone and East Timor;[155] violations of human rights and humanitarian law in Somalia, Rwanda and Eastern Zaire;[156] violations of democratic principles in Haiti and Sierra Leone;[157] terrorism;[158] nuclear proliferation and even failure to cooperate with international prosecutions.[159] These examples illustrate the broad discretion that the Security Council has to determine that a threat to the peace exists; however, Frowein has argued that this does not mean that the notion of a threat to the peace has become limitless. He argues that a threat to the peace exists when, in a particular situation, a danger of the use of force on a considerable scale arises.[160] Although the Security Council has not considered any computer network attacks to date,[161] based on this assessment it would certainly appear that a computer network attack would constitute a threat to the peace where it is of sufficient gravity that a state is likely to respond to it with force, regardless of whether it is categorised as an armed attack, or where the type of attack indicates further violence to follow, whether electronically or by kinetic means.\nOnce the Security Council has determined a threat to the peace, the Council may make recommendations, or require states to take action under Articles 40, 41 and 42 of the Charter, for the restoration or maintenance of international peace and security. Interestingly, once the Security Council has deemed a situation a threat to the peace, it 'is free to take measures against any entity which it considers to be an obstructive factor in the restoration of peace'.[162] Thus, having determined the\n155 See SC Res 788, 19 November 1993 on Liberia; SC Res 918, 17 May 1994, SC Res 929, 22 June 1994 on Rwanda; SC Res 1132, 8 Oct 1997, SC Res 1289, 7 Feb 2000, SC Res 1306, 5 July 2000 on Sierra Leone; SC Res 1264, 15 September 1999 on East Timor.\n156 SC Res 794, 3 December 1992 on Somalia; SC Res 929, 22 June 1994 on Rwanda; SC Res 1078, 9 November 1996 on Zaire.\n157 For Haiti: SC Res 841, 16 June 1993; SC Res 917, 6 May 1994; SC Res 940, 31 July 1994 and most recently SC Res 1529, 29 February 2004.

Provisional measures are made without prejudice to the rights, claims or position of the parties, but failure to comply with them will be taken into account by the Security Council.\nArticle 41 allows the Security Council to decide:\n[W]hat measures not involving the use of armed force are to be employed to give effect to its decisions, and it may call upon the Members of the United Nations to apply such measures. These may include complete or partial interruption of economic relations and of rail, sea, air, postal, telegraphic, radio, and other means of communication, and the severance of diplomatic relations. (emphasis added)\nThis would also allow for the disruption of individual internet access, such as that demonstrated by the United States in response to the 1998 attack by the Electronic Disturbance Theatre, and may also allow for the total disconnection of a country from the internet by a third party, in the same manner as the self-imposed internet blackouts attempted internally by regimes in Egypt, Myanmar and Libya.¹⁶⁴ Some attempts have been made to argue that such a measure would be the electronic equivalent of a blockade (which would fall within the forceful measures provided for in Article 42);¹⁶⁵ however, the present author does not consider that this is an appropriate classification, despite the\n¹⁶³ SC Res 1127, 1997, cited in ibid.\n¹⁶⁴ James Cowie, ‘What Libya Learned from Egypt’, *Renesys Blog*, 5 March 2011, www.renesys.com/blog/2011/03/what-libya-learned-from-egypt.shtml (last accessed 12 April 2011); Jordan Robertson, ‘The Day Part of the Internet Died: Egypt Goes Dark’, *The Washington Times* 28 January 2011, www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/jan/28/day-part-internet-died-egypt-goes-dark/ (last accessed 12 April 2011); OpenNet Initiative, *Pulling the Plug: A Technical Review of the Internet Shutdown in Burma*, OpenNet Initiative (2007), http://opennet.net/sites/opennet.net/files/ONI_Bulletin_Burma_2007.pdf (last accessed 12 April 2011).\n¹⁶⁵ See media reports following both the Estonian and Georgian denial of service attacks.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nARMED ATTACK AND RESPONSE IN THE DIGITAL AGE\nsevere economic effects that this would undoubtedly have on highly technologically dependent states.¹⁶⁶ Electronic measures under Article 41 could arguably also encompass denial of service attacks launched against the media, banking and telecommunications infrastructure of a state, although the shaping of the response to the threat may prove difficult in practice.\nWhere non-forceful measures have been unsuccessful, or if the Security Council determines that such measures would be inadequate, the Council may authorise action under Article 42 by such air, sea or land forces as may be necessary to maintain or restore international peace and security; examples include demonstrations, blockade and other operations by air, sea or land forces of Members of the United Nations.¹⁶⁷ It appears unlikely that the Security Council would consider it necessary to authorise force against a computer network attack; however, where an attack or ongoing series of attacks cannot be prevented or stopped by electronic means, it is within their purview to do so. As noted earlier, force is not necessarily the preferred means of countering a cyber attack because of the distributed nature of many methods of attack.\nA more interesting scenario is the possibility of the Security Council authorising computer network attacks of sufficient gravity to amount to a use of force in response to a threat to the peace. For example, in the past few years the Security Council has passed a series of resolutions expressing its concern over the proliferation risks presented by the Iranian nuclear programme.¹⁶⁸ Although the Council has not explicitly stated that it considers that the programme represents a threat to international peace and security, this is far from unusual; it is clear from the practice of the Council that no formal pronouncement with an express reference to Article 39 is necessary; the use of the language is apparently sufficient.¹⁶⁹ The Council does, however, explicitly state that it is acting under Article 41 of Chapter VII of the Charter, and each resolution calls for member states to implement a series of specific non-forceful measures against Iran. The author has previously concluded that the Stuxnet worm amounts to a use of force as it is\n¹⁶⁶ For example, the OECD estimates the economic impact of shutting down internet and mobile phone services in Egypt for five days in 2011 at US$90 million in direct costs alone.\n¹⁶⁷ Art. 42, UN Charter.\n¹⁶⁸ SC Res 1929 (2010); SC Res 1803 (2008); SC Res 1747 (2007); SC Res 1737 (2006).\n¹⁶⁹ Gray, Use of Force (3rd edn), 256.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCONCLUSION\n113\ngenerally believed to have caused physical damage to approximately 1,000 nuclear centrifuges at the Natanz enrichment facility. Although Resolution 1929 (2010) specifically stresses that it does not authorise any measures exceeding the scope of the resolution,¹⁷⁰ or the threat or use of force, had the measures decided on been taken under Article 42 with its usual phraseology ‘all necessary means’, the Stuxnet worm would have proved an efficient way to achieve one of the aims of the resolution, namely the suspension of enrichment-related activities.\n## 7. Conclusion\nAs with the discussion in the previous chapter relating to the use of force, the classification of computer network attacks as armed attacks sits on top of a deep doctrinal divide between those who would argue for a wide interpretation of the right to self-defence and those who would restrict it. The present author believes that in regard to computer network attacks, a restrictive view of the armed attack threshold and the subsequent right to self-defence is preferable. Classification of computer network attacks which would amount to armed attacks should therefore be restricted to those attacks which cause physical damage to property or persons of a sufficient scale and effect. Given the particular difficulties and length of time involved in accurately attributing attacks and the fact that states acting in self-defence are not restricted to responding in kind, the danger of computer network attacks escalating into traditional conflict is apparent. That is not to say that states cannot respond to computer network attacks that do not rise to the level of an armed attack; a state may still respond with proportionate countermeasures or appeal to the Security Council for a finding that the attacks amount to a threat to the peace.\n¹⁷⁰ Thus even if Stuxnet had not resulted in physical damage but merely stopped the enrichment facility from working it could not have fallen within the terms of the Security Council authorisations.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press",

  "flat_text": "# 3 Armed attack and response in the digital age\nHaving looked at computer network attacks as a prohibited act in the previous chapter, this chapter will look at the exceptions to the prohibition; the permissible response to the prohibited act. The UN Charter system admits only two exceptions to the prohibition on the use of force: collective measures authorised by the Security Council acting under Chapter VII of the Charter; or the inherent right of collective or individual self-defence provided for in Article 51.\nThe exact scope of the right of self-defence remains one of the divisive issues in international law, so it is not surprising that its application to the topic of computer network attacks is particularly complex. First, it is difficult to identify the point at which a computer network attack will rise to the level of an 'armed attack', the threshold that triggers a state's right to self-defence. As seen in the previous chapter, traditional international law focuses on personal injury, fatality and damage to physical property as measures of the seriousness of an attack. This approach is favoured by most commentators writing on the subject to date; however, many catastrophically damaging computer network attacks will not cause any of these deleterious consequences. Further, it is likely that many attacks using computer network operations will not come as a single instance, but rather as a series of events which, taken separately, may not be sufficient to qualify as an armed attack. This raises the issue of the right to respond to 'pin-prick' attacks with a single use of force, a concept which has had a chequered history in international law. The likelihood that computer network attacks will\n See Horace B. Robertson, 'Self-Defense against Computer Network Attack under International Law' in M. N. Schmitt and B. T. O'Donnell (eds.), Computer Network Attack and International Law (Naval War College, Newport, RI, 2002) 122–45, 136, for examples of authors adopting the consequence-based approach.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nARMED ATTACK AND RESPONSE IN THE DIGITAL AGE\nbe used in conjunction with, or as a precursor to, a conventional attack may also raise a right to respond to such attacks under the auspices of the controversial doctrine of anticipatory self-defence. For example, will intrusion into an air defence network be sufficient evidence of an imminent attack following the 2007 Israeli raid on the alleged Syrian nuclear site.\nThe second major difficulty with computer network attacks, as opposed to traditional kinetic attacks, is the difficulty of attributing an attack to its original perpetrator. The length of time required to trace an attack makes questions of the necessity of force to repel a computer network attack difficult to satisfy. Questions of proportionality also arise in determining whether it would ever be proportionate to use armed force in response to a computer network attack. This chapter examines these questions in light of current international law, the definition of armed attack and considers in what circumstances force may be used in self-defence against a computer network attack.\nThe final sections address the authorisation to use force under the auspices of Chapter VII Security Council resolutions, and what measures might be taken by states in response to computer network attacks which fail to meet the threshold for lawful self-defence.\n# 1. Armed attack\nThe right of self-defence is a customary law right, inherent in the sovereignty of states; it has been codified for the most part by Article 51 of the UN Charter as follows:\nNothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security. Measures taken by Members in the exercise of this right of self-defence shall be immediately reported to the Security Council and shall not in any way affect the authority and responsibility of the Security Council under the present Charter to take at any time such action as it deems necessary in order to maintain or restore international peace and security.\nThe customary status of the right has been confirmed by the Nicaragua (Merits) case. Article 51 of the Charter allows self-defence in response to an 'armed attack' and the International Court of Justice has\n Nicaragua (Merits), para. 176.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nARMED ATTACK\nconfirmed in both the Nicaragua (Merits) and Oil Platforms decisions that nothing short of an armed attack (with the possible exception of an anticipated armed attack) will be sufficient to trigger the right of self-defence under international law. The Oil Platforms case also established that it is for the state using force in self-defence to prove that it has been subjected to an armed attack. However, as with the term ‘force’, the Charter does not provide a definition of ‘armed attack’. Further, the historical predecessors to the Charter system do not offer any interpretive assistance. Neither the Kellogg-Briand Pact nor the Covenant of the League of Nations refer to the term. Both formulate self-defence as a response to aggression; hence all attempts at definition were focused on that term. The drafting history of the Charter provides evidence that discussions took place on the difference between an attack and an armed attack (based on the fact that the United States draft of 11 May 1945 contained both terms) and although no definitive conclusion was reached, the term was replaced by armed attack only. Professor Ian Brownlie has pointed out that it is likely that the records of the San Francisco conference contain no definition of the phrase ‘armed attack’ because the term was considered ‘sufficiently clear’ and ‘self-evident’. That was certainly the case in the drafting of the North Atlantic Treaty around the same time, as evidenced by the comments of the Foreign Relations Committee of the United States Senate which noted that the phrase ‘armed attack’ in Article 5 ‘is ordinarily self evident’ and ‘there is rarely, if ever, any doubt as to whether it has occurred or by whom it was launched’. The decision of the International Court of Justice in the Nicaragua (Merits) case made clear that armed attacks form a subset of the term ‘force’ in Article 2(4); therefore those actions which have been discussed in the previous chapter as falling outside the ambit of the definition of armed force will subsequently also fail to meet the threshold of an armed attack. However, not every use of force will be an armed attack,\n Ibid.; Case Concerning Oil Platforms (Islamic Republic of Iran v. United States of America) (2003), International Court of Justice, para. 51.\n Oil Platforms Case, para. 57.\n Stanimir A.

However, the Court fails to specify what that agreement might be, confining itself to citing the following example:\nIn particular, it may be considered to be agreed that an armed attack must be understood as including not merely action by regular armed forces across an international border, but also ‘the sending by or on behalf of a State of armed bands, groups, irregulars or mercenaries, which carry out acts of armed force against another State of such gravity as to amount to’ (inter alia) an actual armed attack conducted by regular forces, ‘or its substantial involvement therein’ ... The Court sees no reason to deny that, in customary law, the prohibition of armed attacks may apply to the sending by a State of armed bands to the territory of another State, if such an operation, because of its scale and effects, would have been classified as an armed attack rather than as a mere frontier incident had it been carried out by regular armed forces.\nThe Court goes on to consider that acts such as ‘assistance to rebels in the form of the provision of weapons or logistical or other support’ do not constitute an armed attack, but might nonetheless constitute a threat or use of force, or amount to intervention in the internal or external affairs of other states. Despite being the subject of much criticism and discussion, the Court’s decision makes clear that under current international law the definition of ‘armed attack’ is dependent on the ‘scale and effects’ of an attack which must be of sufficient gravity to elevate such actions beyond ‘mere frontier incidents’. The view that an armed attack must be of ‘relatively large scale and with substantial effect’ is reiterated by several leading scholars, and is in\n Nicaragua (Merits), para. 195.  Ibid.\n Ibid., para. 195, 231.

See also Dinstein, ‘CNA and Self-Defense’, 100, noting that the use of force must be of sufficient gravity before armed attack is in progress, no matter that it be of small magnitude.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nARMED ATTACK\nagreement with the de minimis rule for small-scale attacks set out in Article 2 of the Definition of Aggression adopted by the UN General Assembly, an example also given by the Court in the Nicaragua (Merits) case.^[14]\nThe Court's distinction between 'the most grave forms of the use of force (those constituting an armed attack)' and 'other less grave forms',^[15] and the resultant gap between force and armed attack, results in the peculiar situation where an illegal use of force not tantamount to an armed attack may be launched by one state against another, leaving the victim state unable to respond in self-defence. Logically and pragmatically the gap has to be quite narrow, inasmuch as 'there is very little effective protection against states violating the prohibition on the use of force, as long as they do not resort to an armed attack'.^[16] Michael Schmitt has commented that this distinction makes sense in light of the Charter's central purpose to 'maintain international peace and security' as it creates a rebuttable presumption against the resort by states to violence.^[17] Thus he notes 'it is logical to interpret the prohibition on the use of force expansively, but characterize exceptions that lie outside the community decisional architecture, such as self-defense, narrowly'.^[18]\nOther commentators, including Judge Simma in a separate opinion in the Oil Platforms case, have argued, however, that it makes no logical sense to prohibit a state from forcibly defending itself or permitting its allies to come to the state's defence where it is the subject of an unlawful use of force.^[19] Any fears of an unwarranted escalation of an incident can be dealt with under the existing rules pertaining to proportionality.^[20] Despite such debate, following the Nicaragua (Merits) and\n^[14] The Security Council may determine whether actions falling under the examples given in Article 3 do not constitute 'acts of aggression' owing to their lack of gravity.

However, the thresholds of each of these concepts, and the responses which each allows, are yet to be established with any certainty.\nThis uncertainty makes the classification of any computer network attack particularly difficult. As noted previously, the possible effects of computer network attacks 'span the spectrum of consequentiality',[21] thus making classification based on the type of computer network attack impossible; each attack must be assessed on its merits. It seems certain, however, that where a computer network attack causes destruction and fatalities on a par with a conventional attack, a state will have a right to respond in self-defence. This is the conclusion reached in a report by the Office of General Counsel of the US Department of Defense, which concluded:[22]\n[I]f a coordinated computer network attack shuts down a nation's air traffic control system along with its banking and financial systems and public utilities, and opens the floodgates of several dams resulting in general flooding that causes widespread civilian deaths and property damage, it may well be that no-one would challenge a victim nation if it concluded that it was the victim of an armed attack, or of an act equivalent to an armed attack.\nWhile undoubtedly correct, the report fails to separate and analyse the attack in its component parts, combining those components which directly cause death and destruction with less severe attacks. Schmitt focuses on the consequences of the attack rather than on the object of the attack or on the intentions of the attacker; the exception being where the intentions of the attacker are specifically to cause physical damage to tangible objects or injury to human beings, in which case Schmitt considers the resort to armed force is permitted.[23] He argues that self-defence should be limited to operations which are de facto armed attacks, or imminently preparatory thereto; the net result being a limitation on both sides to resort to computer network attack techniques which might threaten global stability and on individual responses which might themselves prove destabilising.[24]\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nARMED ATTACK\nIn contrast, Walter Sharp, one of the early authors on the subject, argues that any intrusion into systems containing information which is critical to the national security of the victim state should be considered an armed attack capable of triggering the right to respond with force. This idea is premised on the notion that the features of modern society and its reliance on information systems are such that non-military means can often cause more harm than military ones. However Sharp’s ‘strict liability’ approach has not been borne out by state practice, which to date has recognised such intrusions as simple espionage, an act not prohibited under international law.\nThe present author considers that the threshold for an armed attack conducted by computer network attack must be set in line with current international law regulating the right of self-defence. A state is therefore permitted to respond in self-defence when it is the victim of a computer network attack causing damage to property or persons of sufficient scale and effect to elevate it beyond the equivalent of a frontier incident. The denial of service attacks against Estonia in 2007, disruptive as they were, did not reach this level; neither did the attacks launched the following year against Georgia, although the analysis of that incident is complicated by the subsequent conventional attacks by Russia. No loss of life, physical injury or destruction of property was suffered as a result of the computer network operations launched against either state. In contrast, the 2010 Stuxnet worm has purportedly resulted in significant destruction of property. At the time of writing, reports indicate that the worm may be responsible for Iran having to replace 1,000 of the 9,000 IR-1 centrifuges at the Natanz nuclear fuel enrichment facility. While reports of the effect of the worm on the facility and the resulting impact on Iran’s nuclear programme have differed wildly, a report by the Institute for Science and International Security detailing the effect of Stuxnet has concluded that while the effects of the worm were significant, the effect on Iran’s nuclear programme was only moderate:\n Sharp, Cyberspace and the Use of Force, 129.\n Ibid., 101–2.\n The question of the cyber attacks acting as an indication of imminent armed attacks is addressed in the following section on anticipatory self-defence.\n David Albright, Paul Brannan and Christina Walrond, Stuxnet Malware and Natanz: Update of ISIS December 22, 2010 Report, Institute for Science and International Security (2011) 3.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nARMED ATTACK AND RESPONSE IN THE DIGITAL AGE\nWhile it has delayed the Iranian Centrifuge program at the Natanz plant in 2010 and contributed to slowing its expansion, it did not stop it or even delay the continued build up of [low enriched uranium]\nThat being the case, it would appear that while the Stuxnet worm would undoubtedly amount to a use of force, the scale and effects of the attack do not appear to have sufficient gravity to amount to an armed attack.\n## 1.1. Anticipatory self-defence\nIt is likely that computer network attacks will be used in conjunction with, or as a prelude to, a traditional armed attack. Such attacks designed to 'prepare the battle space' can come in a myriad of forms, including the disablement of intelligence-gathering sensors such as satellites and radar posts via computer network attack, disruption of military communications networks leaving units isolated and unable to be scrambled, or, on the civilian level, disablement of emergency response networks may be launched in anticipation of more traditional kinetic action to follow. It is certainly clear that states are considering how a combination of electronic and traditional attacks might be used in the future. For example, the US actively looked for computer network solutions prior to the 2003 invasion of Iraq and China is openly looking for an 'assassin's mace' to address the perceived asymmetry of the Chinese military against the US in conventional conflicts, widely believed to incorporate computer network attacks. As Robertson points out, in modern warfare the electronic battlefield will play a crucial role, and any steps that a prospective attacker can take to neutralise or destroy its enemy's command and control, intelligence, communications, or weapons-control networks prior to a traditional attack would gain an enormous advantage. This advantage was seen in the 2007 Israeli attack on the suspected Syrian nuclear site where the air defence radar did not detect the attacking planes until they were disappearing back over the border. One might also look to the role of the distributed denial of service attacks against Georgia in 2008 which preceded the physical invasion by Russia. While such attacks may not be sufficient\n David A. Fulghum, ‘Frustrations and Backlogs’, *Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology* 10, 10 March 2003, 33. According to reports these attempts were never put into action due to the interconnectedness of the target systems with foreign-owned networks.\n Robertson, ‘Self-Defense against CNA’, 139.\n See Fulghum, Wall and Butler, ‘Israel Shows Electronic Prowess’.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nARMED ATTACK\nto amount to an armed attack in and of themselves, as preparatory moves in a conventional attack they may be sufficient to justify the use of force under the doctrine of anticipatory self-defence.\n## 1.1.1. Doctrinal debate and imminent attacks\nThere is no consensus in international legal doctrine over the point in time from which measures of self-defence against an armed attack may be taken. In particular, states and commentators are divided over whether a right of anticipatory self-defence exists in international law. The debate centres on whether anticipatory self-defence survived the implementation of Article 51 of the UN Charter, which states that nothing in the Charter ‘shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs’. Those arguing for a restrictive interpretation of the clause interpret this to mean that the right of self-defence is now only available to member states who are the object of an actual armed attack. Gray, Kelsen and Brownlie are some of the leading proponents of this view, which is based on the premise that the Charter forbids any use of force on the part of individual members except for the right of self-defence against an armed attack.\nThose arguing for a more expansive approach point out that Article 51 specifically reserves the ‘inherent right’ of self-defence, and the customary right includes the right to respond to an imminent armed attack. Although ultimately disagreeing with the position, Bothe points out that many authors acknowledge that a threat may be so direct and overwhelming that it is just not feasible to require the victim to wait to act in self-defence until the act has actually started. Other authors have addressed this problem by adopting a broader notion\n Randelzhofer, ‘Article 51’, 803.\n Bowett, *Self-Defence*, 188.

For example, while expressly rejecting the notion of anticipatory self-defence, Yoram Dinstein nevertheless incorporates actions taken in advance of an actual attack by moving the timing of the beginning of the attack, a concept he calls ‘interceptive’ self-defence. Dinstein argues that the beginning of an armed attack is not linked to the first shot but rather to the moment of irrevocable commitment to the attack. Once the die has been cast, the armed attack can be said to have commenced and the victim state need not ‘wait impotently for the inescapable blow’. This concept has echoes in the ‘target locking’ arguments of some states in respect of modern precision-guided missiles. For example, the US argues that an armed attack begins when the radar guiding the missile is locked on and ready to fire, and the rules of engagement of their armed forces reflect this approach. Although, as Lindsay Moir points out, whether such an approach truly distinguishes between an armed attack which has begun but not yet reached the target state, and an armed attack that has not begun but is imminent, is open to question.\nThe standard to be applied for taking action in anticipation of an attack was set out by US Secretary of State Daniel Webster in his letter regarding the Caroline incident of 1837. In his now classic formulation, he stated that the right of self-defence only arises where there is ‘a necessity of self-defence, instant, overwhelming, leaving no choice of means, and no moment for deliberation’. Christopher Greenwood\n Dinstein, War, Aggression, and Self-Defense, 187.\n Dinstein, ‘CNA and Self-Defense’, 111.\n Gray, Use of Force (2nd edn), 108, n. 48. For example, in 1998 US aircraft in the no-fly zone over Iraq fired at a missile battery when its radar had locked on to the planes patrolling the zone. Although there was controversy over whether the radar had locked on, the idea that the armed attack had started when the radar locked on was apparently accepted by Iraq and other states: Keesings (1998) 42368.\n Lindsay Moir, Reappraising the Resort to Force: International Law, Jus Ad Bellum and the War on Terror (Hart, Oxford, 2010), 16.\n In that incident, UK forces captured, fired and sent over the Niagara Falls a merchant vessel called the Caroline which was being used by Canadian rebels and their American forces in attacks against passing British ships. At the time of the UK attack the ship was moored in an American port and two US nationals were killed. One of the British officers, Lieutenant McLeod, was later arrested in the United States on charges of murder arising out of the incident. The British government, seeking McLeod’s release, maintained that its forces had acted in self-defence, to which US Secretary of State Daniel Webster replied in what has become the accepted statement of self-defence doctrine at the time. The Caroline Case (1837) 29 BFSP 1137-8.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nARMED ATTACK\npoints out that the Caroline test was applied by the international military tribunals at Nuremburg and Tokyo, suggesting that the right to respond in self-defence against imminent attacks was part of the customary law right preserved by Article 51 of the Charter. The preservation of an inherent right of self-defence and the existence of customary rights outside the Charter wording is also recognised by the Court in the Nicaragua (Merits) case, which noted that the Charter does not contain all the rules pertaining to self-defence, notably a definition of armed attack and the requirement of necessity and proportionality in any response. The Court expressly did not comment on the lawfulness of an anticipatory response to an imminent armed attack as it was not required on the facts of the case. The Court’s approach in avoiding the difficult questions of self-defence and expressly stating no view on anticipatory self-defence has been followed in both the Wall and Armed Activities cases. Two recent UN reports have not been so reluctant, however. The 2004 report of the UN Secretary-General’s High Level Panel concluded that there was an existing right of anticipatory self-defence against imminent attacks, basing their conclusion on customary international law. Likewise the Report of the Secretary-General the following year expresses the view that responses to imminent threats are fully covered by Article 51 of the Charter.\n## 1.1.2. State practice\nThe content of any customary right of anticipatory self-defence must be examined in light of state practice since the inception of the Charter. While state practice is far from conclusive on the matter, two instances in particular tend to indicate that the doctrine has survived. The first is the Israeli-Arab war of 1967. In the wake of escalating tensions between Syria and Israel, Egypt requested the removal of a United Nations emergency force from Egyptian territory, reinforced troops in the Sinai and dispatched troops to Jordan. Egyptian President Nasser also closed the Straits of Tiran to Israeli shipping (an act that Israel had\n Greenwood, ‘Pre-Emptive Use of Force’, 13.\n Nicaragua (Merits), para. 176.\n Ibid., para. 194.\n The Wall Case; Armed Activities Case, para. 143.\n United Nations, A More Secure World: Our Shared Responsibility.

In response to these actions Israel launched strikes against Egypt's airbases, completely destroying the Egyptian air force. Israel justified its actions in the Security Council by claiming that it had been attacked first, but also by reference to a series of acts of sabotage from Syria, and stressed both the character of the Egyptian blockade as an act of war and ‘perhaps more imminent than anything else, this vast and purposeful encirclement movement’ caused by the transfer of large numbers of Egyptian forces to their ‘very gates’. Gray rejects this incident as evidence of an acceptance of anticipatory self-defence, stating that ‘whatever position is taken on the facts of the outbreak of the Six Day War, the point of importance here is that Israel did not claim to be acting in anticipatory self-defence’. However, Franck notes that Israel’s ‘words and actions clearly asserted a right of anticipatory self-defence against an imminent armed attack’. In emphasising the fact that neither the Security Council nor the General Assembly condemned Israel’s actions, Franck comments:\nMost states, on the basis of the evidence available to them, did however conclude that such an armed attack was imminent, that Israel had reasonably surmised that it stood a better chance of survival if the attack were pre-empted, and that, therefore, in the circumstances, it had not acted unreasonably. This does not amount to an open-ended endorsement of a general right to anticipatory self-defense, but it does recognize that, in demonstrable circumstances of extreme necessity, anticipatory self-defense may be a legitimate exercise of a State’s right to ensure its survival.\nThis accords with the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice in the Nuclear Weapons case, which indirectly commented on the situation when the majority of judges were unable to conclude that the first use of nuclear weapons would invariably be unlawful if the very existence of the state were threatened.\n For a full exposition of the facts of this incident see generally A. Mark Weisburd, Use of Force: The Practice of States since World War II (Pennsylvania State University Press, 1997), 135.\n UN SCOR, 1348th Meeting, 6 June 1967, UN Doc.

In most cases the reaction was based on a conclusion that Israel had failed to demonstrate that there was an imminent threat from Iraq and had thus failed to satisfy the Caroline requirements for anticipatory self-defence rather than a general dismissal of a right of anticipatory self-defence.54 As Greenwood points out, the emphasis on this failure to demonstrate the existence of the imminent threat tends, if anything, to confirm the existence of a right of self-defence in cases where such an imminent threat was shown to exist.55 He goes on to cite Rosalyn Higgins, who notes:56\n[I]n a nuclear age, common sense cannot require one to interpret an ambiguous provision in a text in a way that requires a state passively to accept its fate before it can defend itself. And, even in the face of conventional warfare, this would also seem the only realistic interpretation of the contemporary right of self-defence. It is the potentially devastating consequences of prohibiting self-defence unless an armed attack has already occurred that leads one to prefer this interpretation – although it has to be said that, as a matter of simple construction of the words alone, another conclusion might be reached.\nIn assessing what will constitute an imminent attack, Greenwood argues that there are two additional factors which must be taken into account which did not exist at the time of the Caroline incident:57\nThe first is the gravity of the threat. The threat posed by a nuclear weapon, or a biological or chemical weapon, if used against a city, is so horrific that it is in a different league from the threats posed (as in the Caroline) by cross-border raids conducted by men armed only with rifles. Where the threat is an attack by weapons of mass destruction, the risk imposed upon a State by waiting until that attack actually takes place compounded by the impossibility for that State to afford its population any effective protection once the attack has been launched, mean that such an attack can reasonably be treated as imminent in circumstances where an attack by conventional means would not be so regarded. The second consideration is the method of delivery of the threat. It is far more difficult to determine the time scale within which a threat of\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nARMED ATTACK AND RESPONSE IN THE DIGITAL AGE\nattack by terrorist means would materialize than it is with threats posed by, for example, regular armed forces. These would be material considerations in assessing whether, in any particular case, an attack should be treated as imminent.\nAlthough the existence of a right of anticipatory self-defence remains controversial, it is the view of the present author that a right of self-defence against an imminent attack is established in customary international law. The idea of computer network attacks as an indicator of an imminent attack is discussed in the following section.\n### 1.1.3. Computer network attacks and anticipatory self-defence\nThere are two situations where anticipatory self-defence may be implicated in the information warfare context: first, where a computer network attack serves as an imminent threat of a conventional attack; and secondly, where electronic activity indicates a severe computer network attack (which rises to the level of an armed attack) is imminent.\nAs with any assessment of an imminent attack the context of a computer network attack must be taken into account. Where a computer network attack is launched as a precursor to conventional attack, the target will be important. If an attack targets early warning systems, radar posts or satellite feeds, military communications, or emergency response systems it is likely that a state will judge a traditional attack to be imminent. The Israeli attack against the Syrian air-defence network is a case in point. Had Syria become aware of the intrusion and manipulation of its air-defence radar prior to the attack, they would have been entitled to use force in response. Indeed most military forces would claim that the neutralisation of the air-defence network was the beginning of the attack itself, and would certainly be included under Dinstein’s interceptive self-defence analysis.\nThe disruption of electrical power grids or financial systems, on the other hand, is unlikely to be sufficiently indicative of a subsequent conventional attack when viewed in isolation. Thus when Estonia was subject to distributed denial of service attacks against its banking, media and governmental sites, there were no realistic fears that this signalled the beginning of a traditional armed attack. The additional variables, such as positive attribution to a particular actor and possible motivation, are too many and too varied. However, when such attacks are viewed in conjunction with other contextual indicators, states may be more likely to conclude that a conventional attack is imminent.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nARMED ATTACK\nThe 2008 conflict between Russia and Georgia over South Ossetia illustrates the dangers associated with such an attribution, however. That conflict took place in an atmosphere of increased tensions between the states and in the face of skirmishes between separatist forces and the Georgian military. Prior to the physical invasion, a series of distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks were launched against the Georgian government, and media targets and commentators have noted the close coordination between the targets of the computer network attacks in specific areas and the later physical strikes.58 While it is tempting to conclude that the computer network attacks were indicative of the imminent physical invasion, analysts agree that there is no link evident between the Russian government and the attacks, and that patriotic hackers were behind the electronic disruptions.59 Given the increasing frequency with which hacktivist groups launch such denial of service attacks to further their causes or protest political decisions, it seems unlikely that states will be able to rely on such attacks as indicators even, and perhaps especially, in times of increased political tension.\nThe second instance where a computer network attack may be evidence of an imminent armed attack is the use of computer network intrusions to prepare an electronic battlespace. Viruses, worms, Trojan horses and other forms of malware routinely infect unprotected computers with malicious code which may corrupt data, cause a malfunction, record keystrokes, disable virus protection and collect other information such as passwords and other access codes, feeding them back to a remote attacker. One of the most common features of these types of malware is some form of backdoor payload which allows the attacker to access and control the computer at a later date. Such malware is most often used to 'recruit' unprotected computers to vast networks of compromised computers called botnets. Usually used for spam or criminal enterprise, the controllers of the botnet can also use the command and control servers of the botnet to direct the sending of large amounts of traffic to particular IP addresses, bringing them, and\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nARMED ATTACK AND RESPONSE IN THE DIGITAL AGE\nin some cases the transmission routes, to a standstill in a DDoS attack. Botnets have been utilised in most major DDoS attacks reported to date, including against Estonia in 2007 and Georgia in 2008.\nThe inclusion of backdoor payloads in malware raises interesting questions in relation to anticipatory self-defence. It is clear that a backdoor has no other purpose than to allow an intruder control over the infected computer (whether by direct intrusion or remote control) at a later date. A question which must then be addressed is whether a state has the right to respond in anticipatory self-defence against the perpetrators of a computer network attack with a backdoor payload. Although a backdoor can be used for attacks at any point until it is discovered and removed, and such attacks may have far more serious consequences, including those which would qualify as an armed attack, in most cases, the later use is to send spam or launch DDoS attacks causing inconvenience and only economic damage. Without further information about the purpose or target of any later attack, the mere creation of a backdoor by a state adversary is not indicative of the type or gravity of the attack to follow; indeed the creation of a backdoor may merely be evidence of espionage. Most importantly from a legal perspective, the existence of a backdoor would not meet the ‘imminent’ criteria for lawful self-defence, as the timescale for any subsequent attack is variable; the attack could be launched within days or years.\nOther network intrusions may more indicative, but they will be highly dependent on the circumstances. Two points deserve comment. First, the method of delivery means that there may be little warning of an impending computer network attack; this was one of Greenwood’s additional factors to be considered when determining whether an attack is imminent. However, Greenwood’s second factor, the gravity of threat, will depend entirely on the individual threat; as pointed out in the previous chapter, one of the difficulties with assessing computer\n See, for example, Gadi Evron, ‘Battling Botnets and Online Mobs’ (2008) 9(1) GJIA 121, 124; Tikk, Kaska and Vihul, Cyber Incidents.\n A backdoor is a piece of code which opens a hidden or undocumented access point to the compromised computer or system, bypassing the authentication and security protocols and allowing remote access.\n Backdoors have been found on computers allegedly compromised by Chinese hackers.\n Greenwood, ‘Pre-Emptive Use of Force’, 16.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nARMED ATTACK\n\n## 1.1.4. The ‘Bush doctrine’ of pre-emptive self-defence65\nIn 2002 and 2006 the United States released two security strategy documents containing what appears to be a highly controversial attempt at enlarging the right to self-defence to include the use of force to preempt an attack which is merely threatened, but is not imminent. As Gray points out, there is some uncertainty as to the exact scope of the US claims; however, international criticism of the ‘Bush doctrine’ was both widespread and fierce.66 The 2002 National Security Strategy provided that:67\nWe must be prepared to stop rogue states and their terrorist clients before they are able to threaten or use weapons of mass destruction against the United States and our allies ...\n... Legal scholars and international jurists often conditioned the legitimacy of pre-emption on the existence of an imminent threat – most often a visible mobilization of armies, navies, and air forces preparing to attack.\nWe must adapt the concept of imminent threat to the capabilities and objectives of today’s adversaries ... The greater the threat, the greater is the risk of inaction – and the more compelling the case for taking anticipatory action to defend ourselves, even if uncertainty remains as to the time and place of the enemy’s attack. To forestall or prevent such hostile acts by our adversaries, the United States will, if necessary, act pre-emptively.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nARMED ATTACK AND RESPONSE IN THE DIGITAL AGE\nThe sentiments of the 2002 report are repeated in the National Security Strategy 2006. While at first glance, this may appear to extrapolate logically based on the contingencies of modern weaponry, it compromises the basic premise of anticipatory self-defence laid down in the Caroline case and the evidence of state practice which has evolved the doctrine since. Greenwood has noted, far from removing the requirement of imminence ‘... practice also shows that the right of anticipatory self-defence is confined to instances where the armed attack is imminent’. As noted above, while Greenwood accepts that the notion of imminence must take into account the gravity of the threat and its method of deliverance, he goes on to state: ‘In so far as talk of a doctrine of “pre-emption” is intended to refer to a broader right of self-defence to respond to threats that might materialize at some time in the future, such a doctrine has no basis in law.’ The issue has been debated extensively in the legal literature and will not be repeated here, save to say that state practice has not indicated widespread support for the doctrine, and both UN reports on security have rejected any wider right of pre-emptive self-defence, indicating it is for the Security Council to take pre-emptive action. In 2010 legal commentators watched with interest to see what the policy of the new US administration would be. However they were to be disappointed; while downplaying the idea of pre-emption, the Obama administration’s National Security Strategy 2010 does not dismiss it, merely stating that states must ‘adhere to standards that govern the use of force’ without elaborating further on what those standards might be. The relevance of this apparent\n White House, National Security Strategy of the United States of America (White House, 2006), 23. Although Gray notes the striking absence of any express reference to international law, the 2006 report does state that ‘the United States will, if necessary, act pre-emptively in exercising our inherent right of self-defense’, most likely an implicit reference to Art. 51 of the Charter: Christine D.

Pinprick attacks or accumulation of events theory\nComputer network attacks falling below the armed attack threshold may still trigger a forcible response by states. The most likely strategy utilising computer network attacks is to launch a swarm of lesser attacks, rather than a single large strike qualifying as an armed attack. In a short story published in 1998, John Arquilla detailed what a sustained cyber attack might look like:77 power blackouts, followed by weekly virus attacks of the magnitude of the Nimda, Slammer or Mydoom viruses, oil pipeline ruptures all launched within a matter of days of one another. While some of these attacks may cross the threshold of uses of force under Article 2(4), it is unlikely that any taken on their own would be considered an armed attack under current international law. An analogy may be drawn with cases of repeated cross-border incursions. States have claimed a right to act in self-defence\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nARMED ATTACK AND RESPONSE IN THE DIGITAL AGE\nagainst a series of small-scale incursions or attacks as collectively amounting to a single armed attack. The ‘pinprick’ or ‘accumulation of events’ theory has been unsuccessfully argued in the past by several states, including the United Kingdom, the United States, South Africa and Israel, in an attempt to justify actions purportedly taken in self-defence, that might otherwise be disproportionate. Although the Security Council rejected the claims by these states, each time it has done so on the specific facts of the case and on grounds that such actions were disproportionate. In each instance the condemnation by the Security Council suggested that the actions were unlawful reprisals, rather than commenting on the doctrinal issue of the scope of self-defence. Likewise, the International Court of Justice has avoided expressly discussing the issue, although it appears willing to contemplate the possibility of an accumulation of events amounting to an armed attack. The Court in the Nicaragua (Merits) case commented with regard to the incursions by Nicaragua into the territory of Honduras and Costa Rica:\nVery little information is available to the Court as to the circumstances of these incursions or to their possible motivations, which renders it difficult to decide whether they may be treated for legal purposes as amounting, singly or collectively, to an ‘armed attack’ by Nicaragua on either or both States.\n In 1964 the Southern Arab Federation (SAF) which had military links with the United Kingdom, complained of an armed attack by the Yemen which consisted of a ‘series of aggressions’; invoking collective self-defence at the SAF’s request, the UK launched an air strike and destroyed a fort. The Security Council did not accept the reasoning and issued a statement condemning reprisals as ‘incompatible with the principles and purposes of the UN’. SC Res 188, 9 April 1964, as cited in Jean Combacau, ‘The Exception of Self Defence in U.N Practice’ in A. Cassese (ed.), The Current Legal Regulation of the Use of Force (Martinus Nijhoff, Dordrecht, 1986) 9–38, 27.\n The US claimed it was acting in self-defence against alleged attacks by North Vietnamese naval vessels in the Gulf of Tonkin.

See ibid.\n Gray, Use of Force (3rd edn), 155.\n Nicaragua (Merits), para. 231. It should be noted that the Court found that there had not been an armed attack by Nicaragua based on additional circumstances.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSELF-DEFENCE AGAINST NON-STATE ACTORS\n\nOne final point should be noted: not all attacks which are launched from multiple computers will require a cumulative approach to qualify as an armed attack. A DDoS attack of sufficient scale and effect to elevate it above a ‘mere frontier incident’ would be considered a single attack as the attack originates from a single controller. That is, although the attack appears to come from large numbers of computers in disparate locations, the compromised computers all receive their attack and targeting instructions via command and control servers manipulated from a single controlling ‘master’ which directs the botnet. This is merely the electronic equivalent of an attack using more than one soldier, or a wave of bombers in an air strike.\n## 2. Self-defence against non-state actors\nOne of the most difficult issues in contemporary jus ad bellum is the permitted response of states to attacks by non-state actors. The difficulty\n Case Concerning the Land and Maritime Boundary between Cameroon and Nigeria (Cameroon v.

In newer peer-to-peer based botnets, such as the Storm worm, the controller publishes commands at specific keys in the network to be found by infected machines. However, the net result is the same.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nARMED ATTACK AND RESPONSE IN THE DIGITAL AGE\nstems in part from the fact that Article 2(4) and Article 51 do not entirely correspond in their wording. As has been noted above, Article 2(4) applies only in the international relations between states and thus does not apply to non-state actors; conversely, Article 51 refers to an inherent right of self-defence which is triggered ‘if an armed attack occurs’, with no mention of by whom the attack has been launched. Those arguing for a restricted right point to Article 51’s role as an exception to the prohibition contained in Article 2(4) to argue that it should likewise be constrained to armed attacks by states. Those, including the present author, who consider there is a broader right of self-defence point to state practice, the fact that Article 51 reflects an ‘inherent right’ rather than establishing one, and the recognition by the International Court of Justice in the Nicaragua (Merits) case that the Charter by no means reflects the whole of the body of law governing force.\nAs noted above, the International Court of Justice in its controversial decision in the Nicaragua (Merits) case, has addressed the issue of when a state might be held responsible for indirect military action by rebels acting ‘on behalf’ of a foreign state, establishing the test of ‘effective control’. For computer network attacks, where attribution is one of the major problems, this test will prove particularly difficult to satisfy and commentators have been quick to point out the advantages that such plausible deniability will offer to sending states. However, the question of whether a state has a right to respond with force to an armed attack by a non-state actor absent a degree of state complicity has proved a far more difficult question, and one on which the International Court of Justice has been reluctant to comment. The issue has been covered extensively in recent legal literature, and it is not proposed to conduct a full survey of the arguments here, other than to note that there appears to be a divergence between the limited jurisprudence of the Court and emerging state practice on the issue.\nIt is safe to say that the Court’s treatment of the matter has caused more confusion than clarification. In its advisory opinion on the Wall, in a statement described as both ‘opaque’ and ‘startling in its\n Moir, Resort to Force, 22.\n For the latter point see Nicaragua (Merits), para. 176.\n Although note also the alternate test established by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia in the Tadic case which specified an ‘effective control’ test.\n For a full discussion of the issues, see, for example, Gray, Use of Force (3rd edn); Moir, Resort to Force.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSELF-DEFENCE AGAINST NON-STATE ACTORS\n\nSurveys of state practice, on the other hand, tend to suggest a much greater willingness on the part of the international community to accept the possibility of self-defence against armed attacks by non-state actors without attribution to a state.97 Moir notes, however, that a certain level of support and involvement on the part of the state is required, and is consistently asserted by states claiming the right.98 Thomas Franck suggests that measures taken in self-defence against non-state actors will be accepted by the international community where victim states have identified correctly the place from where it was attacked, that the authorities in that place deliberately, knowingly\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nARMED ATTACK AND RESPONSE IN THE DIGITAL AGE\nor recklessly permitted the attack to occur, and that the victim state's response is proportionate. For computer network attacks each of these factors raise additional issues. First, as discussed in section 3 below, correctly identifying and attributing an attack to a particular perpetrator in a timely manner is one of the most difficult problems in the field of computer network attacks, both from a technical standpoint and a legal one. To be able to do so in a manner that is clear and verifiable by the international community so as to back a claim for the legitimate exercise of self-defence will be an added level of difficulty. Second, even once computer forensics have established the origins of the attacks, proving a sufficient level of support and involvement by a state will be difficult. For example, the computer network attacks against Georgia demonstrated a high level of coordination between the cyber attacks launched by ‘patriotic hackers’ and the military operations carried out by Russia. Russia has denied any involvement with the attacks, and no evidence has been found of state organisations guiding or directing the attacks ‘be it because there was none, because the collection efforts were not far-reaching or deep enough to identify those connections, or because involvement by state organisations was conducted in a way to purposefully avoid attribution’. There was certainly not enough to prove involvement of the Russian authorities in any official capacity, particularly absent the context of the military operations. In addition, states will find it very difficult to prevent or even be aware of computer network attacks emanating from their territory, particularly given the high prevalence of technologies such as proxy servers.\nThe final factor raised by Franck in determining whether the international community is likely to accept a claim by a state acting in self-defence against a non-state actor is the proportionality of the response. The question of proportionality is discussed in section 4 below; however, there are a few issues which pertain specifically to non-state actors. First, states have been quick to condemn actions\n Franck, Recourse to Force, 68.\n Project Grey Goose, Phase I Report, 3.\n Some investigators provided circumstantial evidence of possible involvement by individual officials within the Russian administration; however, many experts remain sceptical of these claims. See generally Tikk, Kaska and Vihul, Cyber Incidents, 74–6.\n It will be recalled that the computer network attacks began prior to the physical invasion and continued after the ceasefire.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nATTRIBUTION\npurportedly taken in self-defence which have targeted the infrastructure of the host state. Given that most computer network attacks by non-state actors utilise this infrastructure, it may prove difficult for victim states to find an acceptable target. Secondly, the dispersed nature of many computer network attacks means that the non-state actors responsible for the attack may be resident in several different host states, complicating the proportionality assessment of any forcible response. It should be noted, however, that the most obvious example of such a dispersed attack, the DDoS attack, would rarely rise to the level of gravity required for an armed attack, absent involvement in a wider programme of attacks that could be responded to under the doctrine of accumulation of events.\nOne final point deserves comment: computer network attacks may also provide a unique opportunity for states to take action against non-state actors without violating the territorial integrity of the state from which they are acting; however, non-state actors are less likely to have infrastructure that would provide viable targets for forcible computer network attacks.\n# 3. Attribution\nOne of the major problems with any computer network attack is the attribution of the attack to a particular actor. While the origin of some attacks becomes immediately evident, either because the attacker identifies themselves, or because they precede traditional attacks that are easily attributed to a particular source, other attacks will be launched anonymously. Given the common use of botnets and the frequency of IP spoofing that takes place in computer network attacks,\n See, for example, the international condemnation of the Israeli attacks against Lebanon in 2006 in response to attacks by Hezbollah, and also the comment of the ICJ in the Armed Activities case that the taking of airports and towns many kilometres away from the site of the series of transborder attacks complained of did not seem proportionate: Armed Activities Case, para. 147.\n See, for example, the opinion of Judge Higgins in the Wall case, dissenting on the grounds that non-forcible measures such as the construction of a wall do not really fall within the concept of self-defence.\n For example, the 'I Love You' virus source code contained the 'signature' of the author.\n For example, the Israeli attack on the Syrian air-defences in advance of an air strike.\n IP spoofing essentially forges the data identifying the sending computer in the header of a data packet so that it appears to originate from a different IP address, thus any response is sent to the forged computer.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nARMED ATTACK AND RESPONSE IN THE DIGITAL AGE\nit is difficult to state with any certainty that the entity that appears to be the perpetrator of the attack is in fact the ultimate attacker.\nIP spoofing can be used either to simply mask the origin of an attack, or in a deliberate attempt to place the blame for an attack on another party. An early example of the latter problem occurred in 1999 when a denial of service attack was launched against the US Department of Transport. The attack appeared to emanate from a server in Maryland run by followers of the Falun Gong movement; in fact, the attack was designed to take down both the Maryland server and the Department of Transport network server, leaving the Falun Gong bearing the blame. However, the attackers had blundered and the attack was traced to a computer located at the address of China's Ministry of Public Security. No information is publicly available regarding the US response to this attack; however, in 2002 Richard Clarke, then White House technology advisor, stated before a Senate Judiciary subcommittee hearing on cyber terrorism that the government had never been able to prove to their satisfaction that a particular government was responsible for a specific unauthorised intrusion.[108]\nThe proliferation of botnets also makes attribution difficult. As the 2007 denial of service attacks against Estonia proved, it can be very difficult to differentiate between attacks that originate from a particular address and those which are merely utilising a compromised computer. Although some of the IP addresses involved in the attacks against Estonia were traced to official IP addresses of Russian state authorities, Russia denied any involvement and claimed that these computers had been compromised and were being manipulated from outside the Kremlin. Subsequent reports by cyber security analysts tend to back this claim, pointing to the lack of evidence and also noting the possibility of spoofing the IP address of the attacker.[109]\nOf course, problems of attribution aren't restricted to cyberspace. Armed attacks following more conventional patterns are often carried out anonymously, or responsibility is claimed by armed groups which appear unlikely to have the resources required for such an attack. Further, in the case of state-sponsored terrorism, it is unlikely that any state will step forward to take responsibility for kinetic acts, let alone electronic ones. Those factors aside, a victim state must still establish\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nATTRIBUTION\na link between the attacking group and the sponsoring state, the same approach must be taken with electronic attacks. This may be particularly difficult to prove where attacks are launched by groups or loose affiliations of individuals in conjunction with traditional state action. For example, when Russia moved troops into South Ossetia following the Georgian offensive in 2008, the air strikes and ground forces were accompanied by a series of computer network attacks against Georgian servers. While these attacks were certainly not serious enough to amount to armed attacks, given Georgia's limited internet connectivity, they illustrate the capacity for other actors to effectively 'join-in' a conflict with or without state authorisation. Several security analysts reported botnets allegedly controlled by the Russian Business Network, a group known to be linked to cyber crime, launching denial of service attacks at Georgian servers. However, software was also freely available for download to individual computers from Russian language websites such as 'stopgeorgia.ru' along with a list of targets, making joining the cyber offensive as simple as a few mouse clicks. As noted previously, the Russian government denies any involvement with the attacks; however, the issue raises the difficult question of state responsibility for non-state actors and the necessity or degree of state involvement or complicity required before force can be used in self-defence against the state. This book does not address this issue in depth; suffice it to note that there is little agreement in the international community on the issue in relation to conventional attacks, let alone computer network attacks. However, it is clear that a state must not knowingly allow its territory to be used as a sanctuary for terrorists or armed bands bent on attacking military targets or civilian objects in another country.\nThe difficulty of attribution also affects the victim state's ability to engage in forcible countermeasures in self-defence.

However, the necessity of waiting for hard evidence of responsibility also opens the possibility that any action taken against a perpetrator once responsibility has been confirmed will be classified as an armed reprisal rather than an action taken in self-defence. Armed reprisals are prohibited under international law.\n## 4. Necessity and proportionality\nAll responses to attacks, whether their means of delivery are kinetic or electronic, are subject to the underlying principles of necessity and proportionality. The International Court of Justice has repeatedly confirmed that self-defence, whether individual or collective, warrants only those measures which are ‘proportional to the armed attack and necessary to respond to it’ as a principle well established in customary international law. The principles are not stated in UN Charter but are often traced back to the Webster formulation in the Caroline incident.\nThe principle of necessity requires that any measures taken avowedly in self-defence must have been necessary for that purpose; the principle is strict and objective ‘leaving no room for any measure of discretion’. That is, it is not sufficient that force is used after an armed attack; it must be necessary to repel that attack, and non-forcible remedies must either prove futile in limine or have in fact been exhausted in an\n Oil Platforms Case, paras 57, 61.\n Dinstein, ‘CNA and Self-Defense’, 111.\n Declaration on Friendly Relations, Principle on the Use of Force, para. 6.\n Nicaragua (Merits), paras 176 and 194; Nuclear Weapons Case, para. 41; Oil Platforms Case, para. 74; Armed Activities Case, para. 147.\n There must be ‘a necessity of defence, instant, overwhelming, leaving no choice of means and no moment for deliberation’.\n Oil Platforms Case, para. 73.\n Greenwood, ‘Pre-Emptive Use of Force’, 23.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nNECESSITY AND PROPORTIONALITY\n\nThe principle of necessity also gives rise to a related principle, namely that actions taken in self-defence must generally be taken without undue delay. In the case of computer network attacks, this may make successful claims of self-defence more difficult. Where the origins of a computer network attack are not obvious, the time taken to conduct computer forensics and establish hard evidence of the identity of the perpetrator may militate against a finding that any subsequent action by the victim state is in self-defence. Similar criticisms were levelled at the United States after a delay of several weeks between the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon and subsequent action in Afghanistan. Likewise, the Court in the *Nicaragua (Merits)* case also criticised the US for commencing activities purportedly in self-defence several months after the major offensive of the opposition against the government of El Salvador had been completely repulsed, although ultimately dismissing the claim of self-defence on other grounds. However, Dinstein notes that this requirement must not be construed too strictly; he points to the delay of approximately five months between the invasion of Kuwait and the authorisation of all necessary means by the Security Council.\nThe principle of proportionality requires the weighing of the response against its permitted purpose of halting and repelling the attack, or, in the case of anticipatory self-defence, preventing it from\n Dinstein, ‘CNA and Self-Defense’, 109.\n Roberto Ago, ‘Addendum to the Eighth Report on State Responsibility’ (1980) II UN Y.B.

Whether or not an act is proportionate will necessarily be dependent on the facts of the situation; however, the action must not be retaliatory or punitive, its lawfulness cannot be measured ‘except by its capacity for achieving the desired result’. This raises an interesting question with respect to computer network attacks; namely whether it would ever be proportionate to use traditional armed force against an electronic attack. The answer must surely be in the affirmative. Proportionality does not restrict the defending state to the same weapons or the same numbers of armed forces as the attacking state; nor is it necessarily limited to action on its own territory. Therefore it would be open to the victim of a computer network attack to use whatever weapons it has at its disposal to repel the attack, as long as the response is proportionate to that purpose. As Ago notes:\nIn the case of self-defence, it was essential to avoid the error of thinking that there should be some proportionality between the action of the aggressor and the action of the state defending itself. Proportionality could be judged only in terms of the objective of the action, which was to repel an attack and prevent it from succeeding. No limitations that might prejudice the success of a response to attack could be placed on the State suffering the attack. The concept of reasonable action must of course enter into the matter, since self-defence could not justify a genuine act of aggression committed in response to an armed attack of limited proportions.\nThus, if a computer network attack is being used to prepare the battlespace for a conventional attack, the use of military force in response must be proportionate in relation to the need to repel the attack as a whole. However, it should be noted that while physically bombing the attacking computers and their owners may be legal, it is not necessarily the preferred method of response. Only a few examples of state intrusion have been made public to date, and no large-scale attacks as would justify a forcible response have been reported. Further, state practice in response to electronic probes emanating from other states have not resulted in forcible responses.\n Ago, ‘Addendum’, 69 para. 121.\n Gray, *Use of Force* (3rd edn), 150.\n Roberto Ago, ‘State Responsibility’ (1980) Vol. 1 *UN Y.B.

Countermeasures against unlawful acts\nWhere a computer network attack does not rise to the level of an armed attack, a state may still respond with proportionate countermeasures. However, where forcible countermeasures are taken in response to an ordinary breach of international law, not constituting an armed attack, they are unlawful.\nHowever, an alternate line of reasoning, arising out of the controversial gap theory put forward by the majority of the International Court of Justice in the Nicaragua (Merits) decision, appears to have muddied the waters somewhat. The Court held that acts committed by Nicaragua against El Salvador, Honduras and Costa Rica amounted to less grave forms of ‘illegal military intervention’. The Court held that that ‘proportionate counter-measures’ were permissible on the part of the victim state; however, they did not create any entitlement by any third state to take collective countermeasures involving the use\nHezbollah telecommunications network. The response was condemned by states; however, given the non-international nature of the dispute, it does not provide any useful indication of state practice in this regard. See generally ‘Hezbollah Takes over West Beirut’, BBC News, 9 May 2008, http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/7391600.stm (last accessed 15 July 2011).\n Jensen, ‘Computer Attacks’, 231.\n Dinstein, War, Aggression, and Self-Defense, 226.\n The Court held that Nicaragua did supply aid to rebels in the territories of El Salvador, but had insufficient evidence of the nature, scale and continuance of such aid. The Court further held that Nicaragua was responsible for certain transborder military incursions into Honduras and Costa Rica. Nicaragua (Merits), paras 152, 164.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nARMED ATTACK AND RESPONSE IN THE DIGITAL AGE\nof force. The Court did not venture an opinion as to what form the individual countermeasures by the victim state might take, or whether they could include the use of force.\nJohn Hargrove has suggested that there are two possible interpretations of the Court’s statement. Either the Court was saying:\n(a) that there are some acts of force that nobody, not even the victim, may resist by proportionate measures of force; or it was saying (b) that the victim may resist with force provided that it does so alone. There is little to be said in explanation of the latter proposition other than it is simply a[n] ... arbitrary announcement of the Court.\nHargrove argues that allowing forcible countermeasures ‘would in one remarkable stroke manage both to impair the right of self-defense, and to weaken fundamentally the prohibition on the use of force by creating an open-ended and wholly new category of exceptions to Article 2(4) of the Charter, of unknown content and limit.’ However, Judge Simma in his separate opinion in the *Oil Platforms* case has argued that the Court in the *Nicaragua (Merits)* case cannot, in the context of that case, have understood that to mean mere pacific reprisals. He argues that the Court can only have meant ‘defensive military action “short of” full-scale self-defence’.\nBut we may encounter also a lower level of hostile military action, not reaching the threshold of an ‘armed attack’ within the meaning of Article 51 of the United Nations Charter. Against such hostile acts, a state may of course defend itself, but only within a more limited range and quality of responses (the main difference being that the possibility of collective self-defence does not arise, cf. *Nicaragua*) and bound to necessity, proportionality and immediacy in time in a particularly strict way.\nSimma’s treatment of the conditions in respect of forcible countermeasures is clearly linked to the classic self-defence analysis, rather\n ‘[A] use of force of a lesser degree of gravity cannot ... produce any entitlement to take collective counter-measures involving the use of force. The acts of which Nicaragua is accused ... could only have justified proportionate counter-measures on the part of the state which had been the victim of these acts, namely El Salvador, Honduras or Costa Rica. They could not justify counter-measures taken by a third state, the United States, and particularly could not justify intervention involving the use of force.’ *Ibid.*, para. 249.\n Hargrove, *Nicaragua Judgement*, 141.\n *Ibid.*, 142.\n *Oil Platforms Case* (per Judge Simma), para. 12.\n *Ibid.*, per Judge Simma, paras 12–13.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOUNTERMEASURES AGAINST UNLAWFUL ACTS\n\nWhere a computer network attack does not amount to an armed attack (or a use of force), any countermeasures taken by the victim state will be conditional on, and limited by, the law relating to countermeasures. In the Case Concerning the Gabcikovo-Nagymaros Project, the International Court of Justice set out a three-part test justifying proportionate countermeasures. First, the action must be taken in response to an internationally wrongful act of another state and be directed against that state. Second, the victim state must have called upon the offending state to discontinue its wrongful conduct or to make reparation for it. And finally, the effects of the countermeasure must be commensurate with the injury suffered, taking account of the rights in question. In this regard the test for proportionality differs between countermeasures and self-defence, where the response must be proportional to the threat, rather than the actual harm suffered. However, the Court also stated that the purpose of the countermeasures must be to induce the wrongdoing state to comply with its obligations under international law, and that the measure must therefore be reversible. In respect of a computer network attack this would seem to fit with current state practice; most attacks to date have merely resulted in states requesting the alleged perpetrator of the attack to cease their actions. However, the nature of computer network attacks, including the type of attacks they make possible and, most importantly, their ability to be reversed, makes computer network attacks particularly useful as a countermeasure against a previous wrongful act of a state. For example, a series\n See generally United Nations, International Law Commission and James Crawford, The International Law Commission's Articles on State Responsibility: Introduction, Text, and Commentaries (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, New York, 2002).\n Case Concerning the Gabcikovo-Nagymaros Project (1997) ICJ Reports 3, International Court of Justice, para. 85.\n Ibid., para. 87.\n Although it should be noted that in all reported cases to date the suspected perpetrator has denied any involvement with the attack.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nARMED ATTACK AND RESPONSE IN THE DIGITAL AGE\nof blackouts in response to an internationally wrongful act may be a useful coercive measure.\nThe 1998 Zapatista ‘Floodnet’ attacks on the Pentagon’s website by the Electronic Disturbance Theatre also provide a model for how electronic countermeasures might work against non-state actors. US Department of Defense specialists created a program that would recognise the Floodnet applet installed on computers trying to access the Department of Defense website. Once the applet was identified, a program was sent back to the activist’s computer to shut down their web browser, thus ending the attack. Although criticisms were levelled at the Department for not thoroughly considering the legal ramifications of such a response, the United States’ decision to respond electronically, in this instance, against an attack which they had been expecting, must be considered a proportionate countermeasure, particularly against a demonstrably non-violent protest group. There was some speculation that this approach was being renewed by the US Department of Defense in its ‘active defence’ policy released in 2011; statements made by Lynn prior to release of the policy indicated that the US intended to stop threats before they reached Department of Defense networks. However, the unclassified version of the Pentagon’s cyber-security strategy appears to focus the concept of active defence on network speed hunting for malicious activity within Department of Defense networks and systems, rather than pushing back beyond the network boundaries. The danger with adopting the push-back approach against states is the risk of escalation of such countermeasures into forcible responses, a situation which the Security Council would be likely to determine a threat to international peace and security, as seen in the following section.\n An applet is a small piece of code designed to perform one specific task within another application.\n Brian Friel, ‘DoD Launches Internet Counterattack’, Government Executive, 18 September 1998, http://govexec.com/dailyfed/0998/091898b1.htm (last accessed 12 April 2011).\n George I.

The Security Council has ‘primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security’ and may recommend or authorise member states to engage in measures, which may include the use of force, in order to pursue this aim. Article 39 provides:\nThe Security Council shall determine the existence of any threat to the peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression and shall make recommendations, or decide what measures shall be taken in accordance with Articles 41 and 42, to maintain or restore international peace and security.\nThis raises two separate issues for the use of computer network attacks. First, when will the Security Council consider computer network attacks to be a ‘threat to the peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression’; and second, under what circumstances might measures authorised by the Security Council under Chapter VII include computer network attacks?\nAs noted, prior to the Security Council recommending action, it must determine that a ‘threat to the peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression’ exists under Article 39. In practice, the Council has almost exclusively exercised its powers by finding a ‘threat to international peace and security’, even in situations where a breach of the peace or act of aggression is obvious; thus the analysis will concentrate on this broader standard. Whether or not there are any limits on the Security Council’s ability to determine a threat to the peace is the subject of debate amongst legal scholars; however, it is generally accepted that the Council possesses considerable discretion in this respect. The resulting range of situations in which the Security Council has found a threat to the peace is increasingly broad and includes the danger of violent countermeasures by states to violations of international law, regardless of their admissibility. The Council has also\n Jochen Frowein, ‘Article 39’ in B.

He argues that a threat to the peace exists when, in a particular situation, a danger of the use of force on a considerable scale arises.[160] Although the Security Council has not considered any computer network attacks to date,[161] based on this assessment it would certainly appear that a computer network attack would constitute a threat to the peace where it is of sufficient gravity that a state is likely to respond to it with force, regardless of whether it is categorised as an armed attack, or where the type of attack indicates further violence to follow, whether electronically or by kinetic means.\nOnce the Security Council has determined a threat to the peace, the Council may make recommendations, or require states to take action under Articles 40, 41 and 42 of the Charter, for the restoration or maintenance of international peace and security. Interestingly, once the Security Council has deemed a situation a threat to the peace, it 'is free to take measures against any entity which it considers to be an obstructive factor in the restoration of peace'.[162] Thus, having determined the\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSECURITY COUNCIL AUTHORISATION AND COLLECTIVE MEASURES\n\nArticle 40 allows the Security Council to establish any provisional measures it deems necessary or desirable to prevent an aggravation of the situation, before deciding what recommendations to make under Article 39. Provisional measures are made without prejudice to the rights, claims or position of the parties, but failure to comply with them will be taken into account by the Security Council.\nArticle 41 allows the Security Council to decide:\n[W]hat measures not involving the use of armed force are to be employed to give effect to its decisions, and it may call upon the Members of the United Nations to apply such measures. These may include complete or partial interruption of economic relations and of rail, sea, air, postal, telegraphic, radio, and other means of communication, and the severance of diplomatic relations. (emphasis added)\nThis would also allow for the disruption of individual internet access, such as that demonstrated by the United States in response to the 1998 attack by the Electronic Disturbance Theatre, and may also allow for the total disconnection of a country from the internet by a third party, in the same manner as the self-imposed internet blackouts attempted internally by regimes in Egypt, Myanmar and Libya. Some attempts have been made to argue that such a measure would be the electronic equivalent of a blockade (which would fall within the forceful measures provided for in Article 42); however, the present author does not consider that this is an appropriate classification, despite the\n SC Res 1127, 1997, cited in ibid.\n James Cowie, ‘What Libya Learned from Egypt’, *Renesys Blog*, 5 March 2011, www.renesys.com/blog/2011/03/what-libya-learned-from-egypt.shtml (last accessed 12 April 2011); Jordan Robertson, ‘The Day Part of the Internet Died: Egypt Goes Dark’, *The Washington Times* 28 January 2011, www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/jan/28/day-part-internet-died-egypt-goes-dark/ (last accessed 12 April 2011); OpenNet Initiative, *Pulling the Plug: A Technical Review of the Internet Shutdown in Burma*, OpenNet Initiative (2007), http://opennet.net/sites/opennet.net/files/ONI_Bulletin_Burma_2007.pdf (last accessed 12 April 2011).\n See media reports following both the Estonian and Georgian denial of service attacks.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nARMED ATTACK AND RESPONSE IN THE DIGITAL AGE\nsevere economic effects that this would undoubtedly have on highly technologically dependent states. Electronic measures under Article 41 could arguably also encompass denial of service attacks launched against the media, banking and telecommunications infrastructure of a state, although the shaping of the response to the threat may prove difficult in practice.\nWhere non-forceful measures have been unsuccessful, or if the Security Council determines that such measures would be inadequate, the Council may authorise action under Article 42 by such air, sea or land forces as may be necessary to maintain or restore international peace and security; examples include demonstrations, blockade and other operations by air, sea or land forces of Members of the United Nations. It appears unlikely that the Security Council would consider it necessary to authorise force against a computer network attack; however, where an attack or ongoing series of attacks cannot be prevented or stopped by electronic means, it is within their purview to do so. As noted earlier, force is not necessarily the preferred means of countering a cyber attack because of the distributed nature of many methods of attack.\nA more interesting scenario is the possibility of the Security Council authorising computer network attacks of sufficient gravity to amount to a use of force in response to a threat to the peace. For example, in the past few years the Security Council has passed a series of resolutions expressing its concern over the proliferation risks presented by the Iranian nuclear programme. Although the Council has not explicitly stated that it considers that the programme represents a threat to international peace and security, this is far from unusual; it is clear from the practice of the Council that no formal pronouncement with an express reference to Article 39 is necessary; the use of the language is apparently sufficient. The Council does, however, explicitly state that it is acting under Article 41 of Chapter VII of the Charter, and each resolution calls for member states to implement a series of specific non-forceful measures against Iran. The author has previously concluded that the Stuxnet worm amounts to a use of force as it is\n For example, the OECD estimates the economic impact of shutting down internet and mobile phone services in Egypt for five days in 2011 at US$90 million in direct costs alone.\n Art. 42, UN Charter.\n SC Res 1929 (2010); SC Res 1803 (2008); SC Res 1747 (2007); SC Res 1737 (2006).\n Gray, Use of Force (3rd edn), 256.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCONCLUSION\n\n## 7. Conclusion\nAs with the discussion in the previous chapter relating to the use of force, the classification of computer network attacks as armed attacks sits on top of a deep doctrinal divide between those who would argue for a wide interpretation of the right to self-defence and those who would restrict it. The present author believes that in regard to computer network attacks, a restrictive view of the armed attack threshold and the subsequent right to self-defence is preferable. Classification of computer network attacks which would amount to armed attacks should therefore be restricted to those attacks which cause physical damage to property or persons of a sufficient scale and effect. Given the particular difficulties and length of time involved in accurately attributing attacks and the fact that states acting in self-defence are not restricted to responding in kind, the danger of computer network attacks escalating into traditional conflict is apparent. That is not to say that states cannot respond to computer network attacks that do not rise to the level of an armed attack; a state may still respond with proportionate countermeasures or appeal to the Security Council for a finding that the attacks amount to a threat to the peace.\n Thus even if Stuxnet had not resulted in physical damage but merely stopped the enrichment facility from working it could not have fallen within the terms of the Security Council authorisations.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press",

The UN Charter system admits only two exceptions to the prohibition on the use of force: collective measures authorised by the Security Council acting under Chapter VII of the Charter; or the inherent right of collective or individual self-defence provided for in Article 51.\nThe exact scope of the right of self-defence remains one of the divisive issues in international law, so it is not surprising that its application to the topic of computer network attacks is particularly complex. First, it is difficult to identify the point at which a computer network attack will rise to the level of an 'armed attack', the threshold that triggers a state's right to self-defence. As seen in the previous chapter, traditional international law focuses on personal injury, fatality and damage to physical property as measures of the seriousness of an attack. This approach is favoured by most commentators writing on the subject to date; however, many catastrophically damaging computer network attacks will not cause any of these deleterious consequences. Further, it is likely that many attacks using computer network operations will not come as a single instance, but rather as a series of events which, taken separately, may not be sufficient to qualify as an armed attack. This raises the issue of the right to respond to 'pin-prick' attacks with a single use of force, a concept which has had a chequered history in international law. The likelihood that computer network attacks will\n See Horace B. Robertson, 'Self-Defense against Computer Network Attack under International Law' in M. N. Schmitt and B. T. O'Donnell (eds.), Computer Network Attack and International Law (Naval War College, Newport, RI, 2002) 122–45, 136, for examples of authors adopting the consequence-based approach.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nARMED ATTACK AND RESPONSE IN THE DIGITAL AGE\nbe used in conjunction with, or as a precursor to, a conventional attack may also raise a right to respond to such attacks under the auspices of the controversial doctrine of anticipatory self-defence. For example, will intrusion into an air defence network be sufficient evidence of an imminent attack following the 2007 Israeli raid on the alleged Syrian nuclear site.\nThe second major difficulty with computer network attacks, as opposed to traditional kinetic attacks, is the difficulty of attributing an attack to its original perpetrator. The length of time required to trace an attack makes questions of the necessity of force to repel a computer network attack difficult to satisfy. Questions of proportionality also arise in determining whether it would ever be proportionate to use armed force in response to a computer network attack. This chapter examines these questions in light of current international law, the definition of armed attack and considers in what circumstances force may be used in self-defence against a computer network attack.\nThe final sections address the authorisation to use force under the auspices of Chapter VII Security Council resolutions, and what measures might be taken by states in response to computer network attacks which fail to meet the threshold for lawful self-defence.\n# 1. Armed attack\nThe right of self-defence is a customary law right, inherent in the sovereignty of states; it has been codified for the most part by Article 51 of the UN Charter as follows:\nNothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security. Measures taken by Members in the exercise of this right of self-defence shall be immediately reported to the Security Council and shall not in any way affect the authority and responsibility of the Security Council under the present Charter to take at any time such action as it deems necessary in order to maintain or restore international peace and security.\nThe customary status of the right has been confirmed by the Nicaragua (Merits) case. Article 51 of the Charter allows self-defence in response to an 'armed attack' and the International Court of Justice has\n Nicaragua (Merits), para. 176.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nARMED ATTACK\nconfirmed in both the Nicaragua (Merits) and Oil Platforms decisions that nothing short of an armed attack (with the possible exception of an anticipated armed attack) will be sufficient to trigger the right of self-defence under international law. The Oil Platforms case also established that it is for the state using force in self-defence to prove that it has been subjected to an armed attack. However, as with the term ‘force’, the Charter does not provide a definition of ‘armed attack’. Further, the historical predecessors to the Charter system do not offer any interpretive assistance. Neither the Kellogg-Briand Pact nor the Covenant of the League of Nations refer to the term. Both formulate self-defence as a response to aggression; hence all attempts at definition were focused on that term. The drafting history of the Charter provides evidence that discussions took place on the difference between an attack and an armed attack (based on the fact that the United States draft of 11 May 1945 contained both terms) and although no definitive conclusion was reached, the term was replaced by armed attack only. Professor Ian Brownlie has pointed out that it is likely that the records of the San Francisco conference contain no definition of the phrase ‘armed attack’ because the term was considered ‘sufficiently clear’ and ‘self-evident’. That was certainly the case in the drafting of the North Atlantic Treaty around the same time, as evidenced by the comments of the Foreign Relations Committee of the United States Senate which noted that the phrase ‘armed attack’ in Article 5 ‘is ordinarily self evident’ and ‘there is rarely, if ever, any doubt as to whether it has occurred or by whom it was launched’. The decision of the International Court of Justice in the Nicaragua (Merits) case made clear that armed attacks form a subset of the term ‘force’ in Article 2(4); therefore those actions which have been discussed in the previous chapter as falling outside the ambit of the definition of armed force will subsequently also fail to meet the threshold of an armed attack. However, not every use of force will be an armed attack,\n Ibid.; Case Concerning Oil Platforms (Islamic Republic of Iran v. United States of America) (2003), International Court of Justice, para. 51.\n Oil Platforms Case, para. 57.\n Stanimir A.

However, the Court fails to specify what that agreement might be, confining itself to citing the following example:\nIn particular, it may be considered to be agreed that an armed attack must be understood as including not merely action by regular armed forces across an international border, but also ‘the sending by or on behalf of a State of armed bands, groups, irregulars or mercenaries, which carry out acts of armed force against another State of such gravity as to amount to’ (inter alia) an actual armed attack conducted by regular forces, ‘or its substantial involvement therein’ ... The Court sees no reason to deny that, in customary law, the prohibition of armed attacks may apply to the sending by a State of armed bands to the territory of another State, if such an operation, because of its scale and effects, would have been classified as an armed attack rather than as a mere frontier incident had it been carried out by regular armed forces.\nThe Court goes on to consider that acts such as ‘assistance to rebels in the form of the provision of weapons or logistical or other support’ do not constitute an armed attack, but might nonetheless constitute a threat or use of force, or amount to intervention in the internal or external affairs of other states. Despite being the subject of much criticism and discussion, the Court’s decision makes clear that under current international law the definition of ‘armed attack’ is dependent on the ‘scale and effects’ of an attack which must be of sufficient gravity to elevate such actions beyond ‘mere frontier incidents’. The view that an armed attack must be of ‘relatively large scale and with substantial effect’ is reiterated by several leading scholars, and is in\n Nicaragua (Merits), para. 195.  Ibid.\n Ibid., para. 195, 231. This position was strongly criticised by Judges Schwebel and Jennings in their dissenting opinions, Schwebel holding that the term substantial involvement in the Definition of Aggression meant that an armed attack could include financial and logistical support.\n Ibid., para. 195.\n See, for example, Randelzhofer, ‘Article 51’, 796 (with accompanying citations). See also Dinstein, ‘CNA and Self-Defense’, 100, noting that the use of force must be of sufficient gravity before armed attack is in progress, no matter that it be of small magnitude.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nARMED ATTACK\nagreement with the de minimis rule for small-scale attacks set out in Article 2 of the Definition of Aggression adopted by the UN General Assembly, an example also given by the Court in the Nicaragua (Merits) case.^[14]\nThe Court's distinction between 'the most grave forms of the use of force (those constituting an armed attack)' and 'other less grave forms',^[15] and the resultant gap between force and armed attack, results in the peculiar situation where an illegal use of force not tantamount to an armed attack may be launched by one state against another, leaving the victim state unable to respond in self-defence. Logically and pragmatically the gap has to be quite narrow, inasmuch as 'there is very little effective protection against states violating the prohibition on the use of force, as long as they do not resort to an armed attack'.^[16] Michael Schmitt has commented that this distinction makes sense in light of the Charter's central purpose to 'maintain international peace and security' as it creates a rebuttable presumption against the resort by states to violence.^[17] Thus he notes 'it is logical to interpret the prohibition on the use of force expansively, but characterize exceptions that lie outside the community decisional architecture, such as self-defense, narrowly'.^[18]\nOther commentators, including Judge Simma in a separate opinion in the Oil Platforms case, have argued, however, that it makes no logical sense to prohibit a state from forcibly defending itself or permitting its allies to come to the state's defence where it is the subject of an unlawful use of force.^[19] Any fears of an unwarranted escalation of an incident can be dealt with under the existing rules pertaining to proportionality.^[20] Despite such debate, following the Nicaragua (Merits) and\n^[14] The Security Council may determine whether actions falling under the examples given in Article 3 do not constitute 'acts of aggression' owing to their lack of gravity.

However, the thresholds of each of these concepts, and the responses which each allows, are yet to be established with any certainty.\nThis uncertainty makes the classification of any computer network attack particularly difficult. As noted previously, the possible effects of computer network attacks 'span the spectrum of consequentiality',[21] thus making classification based on the type of computer network attack impossible; each attack must be assessed on its merits. It seems certain, however, that where a computer network attack causes destruction and fatalities on a par with a conventional attack, a state will have a right to respond in self-defence. This is the conclusion reached in a report by the Office of General Counsel of the US Department of Defense, which concluded:[22]\n[I]f a coordinated computer network attack shuts down a nation's air traffic control system along with its banking and financial systems and public utilities, and opens the floodgates of several dams resulting in general flooding that causes widespread civilian deaths and property damage, it may well be that no-one would challenge a victim nation if it concluded that it was the victim of an armed attack, or of an act equivalent to an armed attack.\nWhile undoubtedly correct, the report fails to separate and analyse the attack in its component parts, combining those components which directly cause death and destruction with less severe attacks. Schmitt focuses on the consequences of the attack rather than on the object of the attack or on the intentions of the attacker; the exception being where the intentions of the attacker are specifically to cause physical damage to tangible objects or injury to human beings, in which case Schmitt considers the resort to armed force is permitted.[23] He argues that self-defence should be limited to operations which are de facto armed attacks, or imminently preparatory thereto; the net result being a limitation on both sides to resort to computer network attack techniques which might threaten global stability and on individual responses which might themselves prove destabilising.[24]\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nARMED ATTACK\nIn contrast, Walter Sharp, one of the early authors on the subject, argues that any intrusion into systems containing information which is critical to the national security of the victim state should be considered an armed attack capable of triggering the right to respond with force. This idea is premised on the notion that the features of modern society and its reliance on information systems are such that non-military means can often cause more harm than military ones. However Sharp’s ‘strict liability’ approach has not been borne out by state practice, which to date has recognised such intrusions as simple espionage, an act not prohibited under international law.\nThe present author considers that the threshold for an armed attack conducted by computer network attack must be set in line with current international law regulating the right of self-defence. A state is therefore permitted to respond in self-defence when it is the victim of a computer network attack causing damage to property or persons of sufficient scale and effect to elevate it beyond the equivalent of a frontier incident. The denial of service attacks against Estonia in 2007, disruptive as they were, did not reach this level; neither did the attacks launched the following year against Georgia, although the analysis of that incident is complicated by the subsequent conventional attacks by Russia. No loss of life, physical injury or destruction of property was suffered as a result of the computer network operations launched against either state. In contrast, the 2010 Stuxnet worm has purportedly resulted in significant destruction of property. At the time of writing, reports indicate that the worm may be responsible for Iran having to replace 1,000 of the 9,000 IR-1 centrifuges at the Natanz nuclear fuel enrichment facility. While reports of the effect of the worm on the facility and the resulting impact on Iran’s nuclear programme have differed wildly, a report by the Institute for Science and International Security detailing the effect of Stuxnet has concluded that while the effects of the worm were significant, the effect on Iran’s nuclear programme was only moderate:\n Sharp, Cyberspace and the Use of Force, 129.\n Ibid., 101–2.\n The question of the cyber attacks acting as an indication of imminent armed attacks is addressed in the following section on anticipatory self-defence.\n David Albright, Paul Brannan and Christina Walrond, Stuxnet Malware and Natanz: Update of ISIS December 22, 2010 Report, Institute for Science and International Security (2011) 3.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nARMED ATTACK AND RESPONSE IN THE DIGITAL AGE\nWhile it has delayed the Iranian Centrifuge program at the Natanz plant in 2010 and contributed to slowing its expansion, it did not stop it or even delay the continued build up of [low enriched uranium]\nThat being the case, it would appear that while the Stuxnet worm would undoubtedly amount to a use of force, the scale and effects of the attack do not appear to have sufficient gravity to amount to an armed attack.\n## 1.1. Anticipatory self-defence\nIt is likely that computer network attacks will be used in conjunction with, or as a prelude to, a traditional armed attack. Such attacks designed to 'prepare the battle space' can come in a myriad of forms, including the disablement of intelligence-gathering sensors such as satellites and radar posts via computer network attack, disruption of military communications networks leaving units isolated and unable to be scrambled, or, on the civilian level, disablement of emergency response networks may be launched in anticipation of more traditional kinetic action to follow. It is certainly clear that states are considering how a combination of electronic and traditional attacks might be used in the future. For example, the US actively looked for computer network solutions prior to the 2003 invasion of Iraq and China is openly looking for an 'assassin's mace' to address the perceived asymmetry of the Chinese military against the US in conventional conflicts, widely believed to incorporate computer network attacks. As Robertson points out, in modern warfare the electronic battlefield will play a crucial role, and any steps that a prospective attacker can take to neutralise or destroy its enemy's command and control, intelligence, communications, or weapons-control networks prior to a traditional attack would gain an enormous advantage. This advantage was seen in the 2007 Israeli attack on the suspected Syrian nuclear site where the air defence radar did not detect the attacking planes until they were disappearing back over the border. One might also look to the role of the distributed denial of service attacks against Georgia in 2008 which preceded the physical invasion by Russia. While such attacks may not be sufficient\n David A. Fulghum, ‘Frustrations and Backlogs’, *Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology* 10, 10 March 2003, 33. According to reports these attempts were never put into action due to the interconnectedness of the target systems with foreign-owned networks.\n Robertson, ‘Self-Defense against CNA’, 139.\n See Fulghum, Wall and Butler, ‘Israel Shows Electronic Prowess’.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nARMED ATTACK\nto amount to an armed attack in and of themselves, as preparatory moves in a conventional attack they may be sufficient to justify the use of force under the doctrine of anticipatory self-defence.\n## 1.1.1. Doctrinal debate and imminent attacks\nThere is no consensus in international legal doctrine over the point in time from which measures of self-defence against an armed attack may be taken. In particular, states and commentators are divided over whether a right of anticipatory self-defence exists in international law. The debate centres on whether anticipatory self-defence survived the implementation of Article 51 of the UN Charter, which states that nothing in the Charter ‘shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs’. Those arguing for a restrictive interpretation of the clause interpret this to mean that the right of self-defence is now only available to member states who are the object of an actual armed attack. Gray, Kelsen and Brownlie are some of the leading proponents of this view, which is based on the premise that the Charter forbids any use of force on the part of individual members except for the right of self-defence against an armed attack.\nThose arguing for a more expansive approach point out that Article 51 specifically reserves the ‘inherent right’ of self-defence, and the customary right includes the right to respond to an imminent armed attack. Although ultimately disagreeing with the position, Bothe points out that many authors acknowledge that a threat may be so direct and overwhelming that it is just not feasible to require the victim to wait to act in self-defence until the act has actually started. Other authors have addressed this problem by adopting a broader notion\n Randelzhofer, ‘Article 51’, 803.\n Bowett, *Self-Defence*, 188. See also Brownlie, *Use of Force by States*, 275; Ian Brownlie, *International Law and the Use of Force by States: Revisited* (Europaeum, Oxford, 2001); Randelzhofer, ‘Article 51’, 803–4; Christine D. Gray, *International Law and the Use of Force* (3rd edn, Oxford University Press, 2008), 160; Dinstein, *War, Aggression, and Self-Defense*, 183.\n Authors subscribing to this expansive view include Thomas M. Franck, *Recourse to Force: State Action against Threats and Armed Attacks* (Cambridge University Press, 2002), 97; Bowett, *Self-Defence*, 187–92; Christopher Greenwood, ‘International Law and the Pre-Emptive Use of Force: Afganistan, Al-Qaida, and Iraq’ (2003) 4 San Diego Int’l L.J. 7; Robert Y. Jennings and C. Arthur H. Watts (eds.), *Oppenheim’s International Law* (9th edn, Longman, Harlow, 1992), 421.\n Michael Bothe, ‘Terrorism and the Legality of Pre-Emptive Force’ (2003) 14(2) EJIL 227, 231.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nARMED ATTACK AND RESPONSE IN THE DIGITAL AGE\nof when an armed attack has occurred in the context of Article 51. For example, while expressly rejecting the notion of anticipatory self-defence, Yoram Dinstein nevertheless incorporates actions taken in advance of an actual attack by moving the timing of the beginning of the attack, a concept he calls ‘interceptive’ self-defence. Dinstein argues that the beginning of an armed attack is not linked to the first shot but rather to the moment of irrevocable commitment to the attack. Once the die has been cast, the armed attack can be said to have commenced and the victim state need not ‘wait impotently for the inescapable blow’. This concept has echoes in the ‘target locking’ arguments of some states in respect of modern precision-guided missiles. For example, the US argues that an armed attack begins when the radar guiding the missile is locked on and ready to fire, and the rules of engagement of their armed forces reflect this approach. Although, as Lindsay Moir points out, whether such an approach truly distinguishes between an armed attack which has begun but not yet reached the target state, and an armed attack that has not begun but is imminent, is open to question.\nThe standard to be applied for taking action in anticipation of an attack was set out by US Secretary of State Daniel Webster in his letter regarding the Caroline incident of 1837. In his now classic formulation, he stated that the right of self-defence only arises where there is ‘a necessity of self-defence, instant, overwhelming, leaving no choice of means, and no moment for deliberation’. Christopher Greenwood\n Dinstein, War, Aggression, and Self-Defense, 187.\n Dinstein, ‘CNA and Self-Defense’, 111.\n Gray, Use of Force (2nd edn), 108, n. 48. For example, in 1998 US aircraft in the no-fly zone over Iraq fired at a missile battery when its radar had locked on to the planes patrolling the zone. Although there was controversy over whether the radar had locked on, the idea that the armed attack had started when the radar locked on was apparently accepted by Iraq and other states: Keesings (1998) 42368.\n Lindsay Moir, Reappraising the Resort to Force: International Law, Jus Ad Bellum and the War on Terror (Hart, Oxford, 2010), 16.\n In that incident, UK forces captured, fired and sent over the Niagara Falls a merchant vessel called the Caroline which was being used by Canadian rebels and their American forces in attacks against passing British ships. At the time of the UK attack the ship was moored in an American port and two US nationals were killed. One of the British officers, Lieutenant McLeod, was later arrested in the United States on charges of murder arising out of the incident. The British government, seeking McLeod’s release, maintained that its forces had acted in self-defence, to which US Secretary of State Daniel Webster replied in what has become the accepted statement of self-defence doctrine at the time. The Caroline Case (1837) 29 BFSP 1137-8.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nARMED ATTACK\npoints out that the Caroline test was applied by the international military tribunals at Nuremburg and Tokyo, suggesting that the right to respond in self-defence against imminent attacks was part of the customary law right preserved by Article 51 of the Charter. The preservation of an inherent right of self-defence and the existence of customary rights outside the Charter wording is also recognised by the Court in the Nicaragua (Merits) case, which noted that the Charter does not contain all the rules pertaining to self-defence, notably a definition of armed attack and the requirement of necessity and proportionality in any response. The Court expressly did not comment on the lawfulness of an anticipatory response to an imminent armed attack as it was not required on the facts of the case. The Court’s approach in avoiding the difficult questions of self-defence and expressly stating no view on anticipatory self-defence has been followed in both the Wall and Armed Activities cases. Two recent UN reports have not been so reluctant, however. The 2004 report of the UN Secretary-General’s High Level Panel concluded that there was an existing right of anticipatory self-defence against imminent attacks, basing their conclusion on customary international law. Likewise the Report of the Secretary-General the following year expresses the view that responses to imminent threats are fully covered by Article 51 of the Charter.\n## 1.1.2. State practice\nThe content of any customary right of anticipatory self-defence must be examined in light of state practice since the inception of the Charter. While state practice is far from conclusive on the matter, two instances in particular tend to indicate that the doctrine has survived. The first is the Israeli-Arab war of 1967. In the wake of escalating tensions between Syria and Israel, Egypt requested the removal of a United Nations emergency force from Egyptian territory, reinforced troops in the Sinai and dispatched troops to Jordan. Egyptian President Nasser also closed the Straits of Tiran to Israeli shipping (an act that Israel had\n Greenwood, ‘Pre-Emptive Use of Force’, 13.\n Nicaragua (Merits), para. 176.\n Ibid., para. 194.\n The Wall Case; Armed Activities Case, para. 143.\n United Nations, A More Secure World: Our Shared Responsibility.

In response to these actions Israel launched strikes against Egypt's airbases, completely destroying the Egyptian air force. Israel justified its actions in the Security Council by claiming that it had been attacked first, but also by reference to a series of acts of sabotage from Syria, and stressed both the character of the Egyptian blockade as an act of war and ‘perhaps more imminent than anything else, this vast and purposeful encirclement movement’ caused by the transfer of large numbers of Egyptian forces to their ‘very gates’. Gray rejects this incident as evidence of an acceptance of anticipatory self-defence, stating that ‘whatever position is taken on the facts of the outbreak of the Six Day War, the point of importance here is that Israel did not claim to be acting in anticipatory self-defence’. However, Franck notes that Israel’s ‘words and actions clearly asserted a right of anticipatory self-defence against an imminent armed attack’. In emphasising the fact that neither the Security Council nor the General Assembly condemned Israel’s actions, Franck comments:\nMost states, on the basis of the evidence available to them, did however conclude that such an armed attack was imminent, that Israel had reasonably surmised that it stood a better chance of survival if the attack were pre-empted, and that, therefore, in the circumstances, it had not acted unreasonably. This does not amount to an open-ended endorsement of a general right to anticipatory self-defense, but it does recognize that, in demonstrable circumstances of extreme necessity, anticipatory self-defense may be a legitimate exercise of a State’s right to ensure its survival.\nThis accords with the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice in the Nuclear Weapons case, which indirectly commented on the situation when the majority of judges were unable to conclude that the first use of nuclear weapons would invariably be unlawful if the very existence of the state were threatened.\n For a full exposition of the facts of this incident see generally A. Mark Weisburd, Use of Force: The Practice of States since World War II (Pennsylvania State University Press, 1997), 135.\n UN SCOR, 1348th Meeting, 6 June 1967, UN Doc.

In most cases the reaction was based on a conclusion that Israel had failed to demonstrate that there was an imminent threat from Iraq and had thus failed to satisfy the Caroline requirements for anticipatory self-defence rather than a general dismissal of a right of anticipatory self-defence.54 As Greenwood points out, the emphasis on this failure to demonstrate the existence of the imminent threat tends, if anything, to confirm the existence of a right of self-defence in cases where such an imminent threat was shown to exist.55 He goes on to cite Rosalyn Higgins, who notes:56\n[I]n a nuclear age, common sense cannot require one to interpret an ambiguous provision in a text in a way that requires a state passively to accept its fate before it can defend itself. And, even in the face of conventional warfare, this would also seem the only realistic interpretation of the contemporary right of self-defence. It is the potentially devastating consequences of prohibiting self-defence unless an armed attack has already occurred that leads one to prefer this interpretation – although it has to be said that, as a matter of simple construction of the words alone, another conclusion might be reached.\nIn assessing what will constitute an imminent attack, Greenwood argues that there are two additional factors which must be taken into account which did not exist at the time of the Caroline incident:57\nThe first is the gravity of the threat. The threat posed by a nuclear weapon, or a biological or chemical weapon, if used against a city, is so horrific that it is in a different league from the threats posed (as in the Caroline) by cross-border raids conducted by men armed only with rifles. Where the threat is an attack by weapons of mass destruction, the risk imposed upon a State by waiting until that attack actually takes place compounded by the impossibility for that State to afford its population any effective protection once the attack has been launched, mean that such an attack can reasonably be treated as imminent in circumstances where an attack by conventional means would not be so regarded. The second consideration is the method of delivery of the threat. It is far more difficult to determine the time scale within which a threat of\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nARMED ATTACK AND RESPONSE IN THE DIGITAL AGE\nattack by terrorist means would materialize than it is with threats posed by, for example, regular armed forces. These would be material considerations in assessing whether, in any particular case, an attack should be treated as imminent.\nAlthough the existence of a right of anticipatory self-defence remains controversial, it is the view of the present author that a right of self-defence against an imminent attack is established in customary international law. The idea of computer network attacks as an indicator of an imminent attack is discussed in the following section.\n### 1.1.3. Computer network attacks and anticipatory self-defence\nThere are two situations where anticipatory self-defence may be implicated in the information warfare context: first, where a computer network attack serves as an imminent threat of a conventional attack; and secondly, where electronic activity indicates a severe computer network attack (which rises to the level of an armed attack) is imminent.\nAs with any assessment of an imminent attack the context of a computer network attack must be taken into account. Where a computer network attack is launched as a precursor to conventional attack, the target will be important. If an attack targets early warning systems, radar posts or satellite feeds, military communications, or emergency response systems it is likely that a state will judge a traditional attack to be imminent. The Israeli attack against the Syrian air-defence network is a case in point. Had Syria become aware of the intrusion and manipulation of its air-defence radar prior to the attack, they would have been entitled to use force in response. Indeed most military forces would claim that the neutralisation of the air-defence network was the beginning of the attack itself, and would certainly be included under Dinstein’s interceptive self-defence analysis.\nThe disruption of electrical power grids or financial systems, on the other hand, is unlikely to be sufficiently indicative of a subsequent conventional attack when viewed in isolation. Thus when Estonia was subject to distributed denial of service attacks against its banking, media and governmental sites, there were no realistic fears that this signalled the beginning of a traditional armed attack. The additional variables, such as positive attribution to a particular actor and possible motivation, are too many and too varied. However, when such attacks are viewed in conjunction with other contextual indicators, states may be more likely to conclude that a conventional attack is imminent.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nARMED ATTACK\nThe 2008 conflict between Russia and Georgia over South Ossetia illustrates the dangers associated with such an attribution, however. That conflict took place in an atmosphere of increased tensions between the states and in the face of skirmishes between separatist forces and the Georgian military. Prior to the physical invasion, a series of distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks were launched against the Georgian government, and media targets and commentators have noted the close coordination between the targets of the computer network attacks in specific areas and the later physical strikes.58 While it is tempting to conclude that the computer network attacks were indicative of the imminent physical invasion, analysts agree that there is no link evident between the Russian government and the attacks, and that patriotic hackers were behind the electronic disruptions.59 Given the increasing frequency with which hacktivist groups launch such denial of service attacks to further their causes or protest political decisions, it seems unlikely that states will be able to rely on such attacks as indicators even, and perhaps especially, in times of increased political tension.\nThe second instance where a computer network attack may be evidence of an imminent armed attack is the use of computer network intrusions to prepare an electronic battlespace. Viruses, worms, Trojan horses and other forms of malware routinely infect unprotected computers with malicious code which may corrupt data, cause a malfunction, record keystrokes, disable virus protection and collect other information such as passwords and other access codes, feeding them back to a remote attacker. One of the most common features of these types of malware is some form of backdoor payload which allows the attacker to access and control the computer at a later date. Such malware is most often used to 'recruit' unprotected computers to vast networks of compromised computers called botnets. Usually used for spam or criminal enterprise, the controllers of the botnet can also use the command and control servers of the botnet to direct the sending of large amounts of traffic to particular IP addresses, bringing them, and\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nARMED ATTACK AND RESPONSE IN THE DIGITAL AGE\nin some cases the transmission routes, to a standstill in a DDoS attack. Botnets have been utilised in most major DDoS attacks reported to date, including against Estonia in 2007 and Georgia in 2008.\nThe inclusion of backdoor payloads in malware raises interesting questions in relation to anticipatory self-defence. It is clear that a backdoor has no other purpose than to allow an intruder control over the infected computer (whether by direct intrusion or remote control) at a later date. A question which must then be addressed is whether a state has the right to respond in anticipatory self-defence against the perpetrators of a computer network attack with a backdoor payload. Although a backdoor can be used for attacks at any point until it is discovered and removed, and such attacks may have far more serious consequences, including those which would qualify as an armed attack, in most cases, the later use is to send spam or launch DDoS attacks causing inconvenience and only economic damage. Without further information about the purpose or target of any later attack, the mere creation of a backdoor by a state adversary is not indicative of the type or gravity of the attack to follow; indeed the creation of a backdoor may merely be evidence of espionage. Most importantly from a legal perspective, the existence of a backdoor would not meet the ‘imminent’ criteria for lawful self-defence, as the timescale for any subsequent attack is variable; the attack could be launched within days or years.\nOther network intrusions may more indicative, but they will be highly dependent on the circumstances. Two points deserve comment. First, the method of delivery means that there may be little warning of an impending computer network attack; this was one of Greenwood’s additional factors to be considered when determining whether an attack is imminent. However, Greenwood’s second factor, the gravity of threat, will depend entirely on the individual threat; as pointed out in the previous chapter, one of the difficulties with assessing computer\n See, for example, Gadi Evron, ‘Battling Botnets and Online Mobs’ (2008) 9(1) GJIA 121, 124; Tikk, Kaska and Vihul, Cyber Incidents.\n A backdoor is a piece of code which opens a hidden or undocumented access point to the compromised computer or system, bypassing the authentication and security protocols and allowing remote access.\n Backdoors have been found on computers allegedly compromised by Chinese hackers.\n Greenwood, ‘Pre-Emptive Use of Force’, 16.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nARMED ATTACK\n\n## 1.1.4. The ‘Bush doctrine’ of pre-emptive self-defence65\nIn 2002 and 2006 the United States released two security strategy documents containing what appears to be a highly controversial attempt at enlarging the right to self-defence to include the use of force to preempt an attack which is merely threatened, but is not imminent. As Gray points out, there is some uncertainty as to the exact scope of the US claims; however, international criticism of the ‘Bush doctrine’ was both widespread and fierce.66 The 2002 National Security Strategy provided that:67\nWe must be prepared to stop rogue states and their terrorist clients before they are able to threaten or use weapons of mass destruction against the United States and our allies ...\n... Legal scholars and international jurists often conditioned the legitimacy of pre-emption on the existence of an imminent threat – most often a visible mobilization of armies, navies, and air forces preparing to attack.\nWe must adapt the concept of imminent threat to the capabilities and objectives of today’s adversaries ... The greater the threat, the greater is the risk of inaction – and the more compelling the case for taking anticipatory action to defend ourselves, even if uncertainty remains as to the time and place of the enemy’s attack. To forestall or prevent such hostile acts by our adversaries, the United States will, if necessary, act pre-emptively.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nARMED ATTACK AND RESPONSE IN THE DIGITAL AGE\nThe sentiments of the 2002 report are repeated in the National Security Strategy 2006. While at first glance, this may appear to extrapolate logically based on the contingencies of modern weaponry, it compromises the basic premise of anticipatory self-defence laid down in the Caroline case and the evidence of state practice which has evolved the doctrine since. Greenwood has noted, far from removing the requirement of imminence ‘... practice also shows that the right of anticipatory self-defence is confined to instances where the armed attack is imminent’. As noted above, while Greenwood accepts that the notion of imminence must take into account the gravity of the threat and its method of deliverance, he goes on to state: ‘In so far as talk of a doctrine of “pre-emption” is intended to refer to a broader right of self-defence to respond to threats that might materialize at some time in the future, such a doctrine has no basis in law.’ The issue has been debated extensively in the legal literature and will not be repeated here, save to say that state practice has not indicated widespread support for the doctrine, and both UN reports on security have rejected any wider right of pre-emptive self-defence, indicating it is for the Security Council to take pre-emptive action. In 2010 legal commentators watched with interest to see what the policy of the new US administration would be. However they were to be disappointed; while downplaying the idea of pre-emption, the Obama administration’s National Security Strategy 2010 does not dismiss it, merely stating that states must ‘adhere to standards that govern the use of force’ without elaborating further on what those standards might be. The relevance of this apparent\n White House, National Security Strategy of the United States of America (White House, 2006), 23. Although Gray notes the striking absence of any express reference to international law, the 2006 report does state that ‘the United States will, if necessary, act pre-emptively in exercising our inherent right of self-defense’, most likely an implicit reference to Art. 51 of the Charter: Christine D.

Pinprick attacks or accumulation of events theory\nComputer network attacks falling below the armed attack threshold may still trigger a forcible response by states. The most likely strategy utilising computer network attacks is to launch a swarm of lesser attacks, rather than a single large strike qualifying as an armed attack. In a short story published in 1998, John Arquilla detailed what a sustained cyber attack might look like:77 power blackouts, followed by weekly virus attacks of the magnitude of the Nimda, Slammer or Mydoom viruses, oil pipeline ruptures all launched within a matter of days of one another. While some of these attacks may cross the threshold of uses of force under Article 2(4), it is unlikely that any taken on their own would be considered an armed attack under current international law. An analogy may be drawn with cases of repeated cross-border incursions. States have claimed a right to act in self-defence\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nARMED ATTACK AND RESPONSE IN THE DIGITAL AGE\nagainst a series of small-scale incursions or attacks as collectively amounting to a single armed attack. The ‘pinprick’ or ‘accumulation of events’ theory has been unsuccessfully argued in the past by several states, including the United Kingdom, the United States, South Africa and Israel, in an attempt to justify actions purportedly taken in self-defence, that might otherwise be disproportionate. Although the Security Council rejected the claims by these states, each time it has done so on the specific facts of the case and on grounds that such actions were disproportionate. In each instance the condemnation by the Security Council suggested that the actions were unlawful reprisals, rather than commenting on the doctrinal issue of the scope of self-defence. Likewise, the International Court of Justice has avoided expressly discussing the issue, although it appears willing to contemplate the possibility of an accumulation of events amounting to an armed attack. The Court in the Nicaragua (Merits) case commented with regard to the incursions by Nicaragua into the territory of Honduras and Costa Rica:\nVery little information is available to the Court as to the circumstances of these incursions or to their possible motivations, which renders it difficult to decide whether they may be treated for legal purposes as amounting, singly or collectively, to an ‘armed attack’ by Nicaragua on either or both States.\n In 1964 the Southern Arab Federation (SAF) which had military links with the United Kingdom, complained of an armed attack by the Yemen which consisted of a ‘series of aggressions’; invoking collective self-defence at the SAF’s request, the UK launched an air strike and destroyed a fort. The Security Council did not accept the reasoning and issued a statement condemning reprisals as ‘incompatible with the principles and purposes of the UN’. SC Res 188, 9 April 1964, as cited in Jean Combacau, ‘The Exception of Self Defence in U.N Practice’ in A. Cassese (ed.), The Current Legal Regulation of the Use of Force (Martinus Nijhoff, Dordrecht, 1986) 9–38, 27.\n The US claimed it was acting in self-defence against alleged attacks by North Vietnamese naval vessels in the Gulf of Tonkin. Letter of 17 February 1979, S/13094 (SCOR, 36th Year) cited in ibid., 17.\n The Security Council has rejected claims of self-defence by Israel made to justify incursions into neighbouring states to attack Palestinian bases, when it attacked Jordan in 1966 (SC Res 228, 25 November 1966) and 1969 (SC Res 265, 1 April 1969), and Lebanon in 1969 (SC Res 270, 16 August 1969), 1970 (SC Res 279, 12 May 1970), 1972 (SC Res 313, 28 February 1972), 1973 (SC Res 332, 21 April 1973) and 1974 (SC Res 347, 24 April 1974). See ibid.\n Gray, Use of Force (3rd edn), 155.\n Nicaragua (Merits), para. 231. It should be noted that the Court found that there had not been an armed attack by Nicaragua based on additional circumstances.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSELF-DEFENCE AGAINST NON-STATE ACTORS\n\nOne final point should be noted: not all attacks which are launched from multiple computers will require a cumulative approach to qualify as an armed attack. A DDoS attack of sufficient scale and effect to elevate it above a ‘mere frontier incident’ would be considered a single attack as the attack originates from a single controller. That is, although the attack appears to come from large numbers of computers in disparate locations, the compromised computers all receive their attack and targeting instructions via command and control servers manipulated from a single controlling ‘master’ which directs the botnet. This is merely the electronic equivalent of an attack using more than one soldier, or a wave of bombers in an air strike.\n## 2. Self-defence against non-state actors\nOne of the most difficult issues in contemporary jus ad bellum is the permitted response of states to attacks by non-state actors. The difficulty\n Case Concerning the Land and Maritime Boundary between Cameroon and Nigeria (Cameroon v. Nigeria: Equatorial Guinea Invervening) (2002) ICJ Reports, International Court of Justice, para. 323; Oil Platforms Case, para. 64; Armed Activities Case, para. 146.\n Oil Platforms Case, para. 64.\n See section 3, below.\n For a detailed description of DDoS attacks, see Bennett Todd, Distributed Denial of Service Attacks (2000), www.linuxsecurity.com/resource_files/intrusion_detection/ddos-faq.html (last accessed 12 April 2011).\n In traditional botnets this is generally through an Internet Relay Chat (IRC) Server. In newer peer-to-peer based botnets, such as the Storm worm, the controller publishes commands at specific keys in the network to be found by infected machines. However, the net result is the same.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nARMED ATTACK AND RESPONSE IN THE DIGITAL AGE\nstems in part from the fact that Article 2(4) and Article 51 do not entirely correspond in their wording. As has been noted above, Article 2(4) applies only in the international relations between states and thus does not apply to non-state actors; conversely, Article 51 refers to an inherent right of self-defence which is triggered ‘if an armed attack occurs’, with no mention of by whom the attack has been launched. Those arguing for a restricted right point to Article 51’s role as an exception to the prohibition contained in Article 2(4) to argue that it should likewise be constrained to armed attacks by states. Those, including the present author, who consider there is a broader right of self-defence point to state practice, the fact that Article 51 reflects an ‘inherent right’ rather than establishing one, and the recognition by the International Court of Justice in the Nicaragua (Merits) case that the Charter by no means reflects the whole of the body of law governing force.\nAs noted above, the International Court of Justice in its controversial decision in the Nicaragua (Merits) case, has addressed the issue of when a state might be held responsible for indirect military action by rebels acting ‘on behalf’ of a foreign state, establishing the test of ‘effective control’. For computer network attacks, where attribution is one of the major problems, this test will prove particularly difficult to satisfy and commentators have been quick to point out the advantages that such plausible deniability will offer to sending states. However, the question of whether a state has a right to respond with force to an armed attack by a non-state actor absent a degree of state complicity has proved a far more difficult question, and one on which the International Court of Justice has been reluctant to comment. The issue has been covered extensively in recent legal literature, and it is not proposed to conduct a full survey of the arguments here, other than to note that there appears to be a divergence between the limited jurisprudence of the Court and emerging state practice on the issue.\nIt is safe to say that the Court’s treatment of the matter has caused more confusion than clarification. In its advisory opinion on the Wall, in a statement described as both ‘opaque’ and ‘startling in its\n Moir, Resort to Force, 22.\n For the latter point see Nicaragua (Merits), para. 176.\n Although note also the alternate test established by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia in the Tadic case which specified an ‘effective control’ test.\n For a full discussion of the issues, see, for example, Gray, Use of Force (3rd edn); Moir, Resort to Force.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSELF-DEFENCE AGAINST NON-STATE ACTORS\n\nSurveys of state practice, on the other hand, tend to suggest a much greater willingness on the part of the international community to accept the possibility of self-defence against armed attacks by non-state actors without attribution to a state.97 Moir notes, however, that a certain level of support and involvement on the part of the state is required, and is consistently asserted by states claiming the right.98 Thomas Franck suggests that measures taken in self-defence against non-state actors will be accepted by the international community where victim states have identified correctly the place from where it was attacked, that the authorities in that place deliberately, knowingly\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nARMED ATTACK AND RESPONSE IN THE DIGITAL AGE\nor recklessly permitted the attack to occur, and that the victim state's response is proportionate. For computer network attacks each of these factors raise additional issues. First, as discussed in section 3 below, correctly identifying and attributing an attack to a particular perpetrator in a timely manner is one of the most difficult problems in the field of computer network attacks, both from a technical standpoint and a legal one. To be able to do so in a manner that is clear and verifiable by the international community so as to back a claim for the legitimate exercise of self-defence will be an added level of difficulty. Second, even once computer forensics have established the origins of the attacks, proving a sufficient level of support and involvement by a state will be difficult. For example, the computer network attacks against Georgia demonstrated a high level of coordination between the cyber attacks launched by ‘patriotic hackers’ and the military operations carried out by Russia. Russia has denied any involvement with the attacks, and no evidence has been found of state organisations guiding or directing the attacks ‘be it because there was none, because the collection efforts were not far-reaching or deep enough to identify those connections, or because involvement by state organisations was conducted in a way to purposefully avoid attribution’. There was certainly not enough to prove involvement of the Russian authorities in any official capacity, particularly absent the context of the military operations. In addition, states will find it very difficult to prevent or even be aware of computer network attacks emanating from their territory, particularly given the high prevalence of technologies such as proxy servers.\nThe final factor raised by Franck in determining whether the international community is likely to accept a claim by a state acting in self-defence against a non-state actor is the proportionality of the response. The question of proportionality is discussed in section 4 below; however, there are a few issues which pertain specifically to non-state actors. First, states have been quick to condemn actions\n Franck, Recourse to Force, 68.\n Project Grey Goose, Phase I Report, 3.\n Some investigators provided circumstantial evidence of possible involvement by individual officials within the Russian administration; however, many experts remain sceptical of these claims. See generally Tikk, Kaska and Vihul, Cyber Incidents, 74–6.\n It will be recalled that the computer network attacks began prior to the physical invasion and continued after the ceasefire.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nATTRIBUTION\npurportedly taken in self-defence which have targeted the infrastructure of the host state. Given that most computer network attacks by non-state actors utilise this infrastructure, it may prove difficult for victim states to find an acceptable target. Secondly, the dispersed nature of many computer network attacks means that the non-state actors responsible for the attack may be resident in several different host states, complicating the proportionality assessment of any forcible response. It should be noted, however, that the most obvious example of such a dispersed attack, the DDoS attack, would rarely rise to the level of gravity required for an armed attack, absent involvement in a wider programme of attacks that could be responded to under the doctrine of accumulation of events.\nOne final point deserves comment: computer network attacks may also provide a unique opportunity for states to take action against non-state actors without violating the territorial integrity of the state from which they are acting; however, non-state actors are less likely to have infrastructure that would provide viable targets for forcible computer network attacks.\n# 3. Attribution\nOne of the major problems with any computer network attack is the attribution of the attack to a particular actor. While the origin of some attacks becomes immediately evident, either because the attacker identifies themselves, or because they precede traditional attacks that are easily attributed to a particular source, other attacks will be launched anonymously. Given the common use of botnets and the frequency of IP spoofing that takes place in computer network attacks,\n See, for example, the international condemnation of the Israeli attacks against Lebanon in 2006 in response to attacks by Hezbollah, and also the comment of the ICJ in the Armed Activities case that the taking of airports and towns many kilometres away from the site of the series of transborder attacks complained of did not seem proportionate: Armed Activities Case, para. 147.\n See, for example, the opinion of Judge Higgins in the Wall case, dissenting on the grounds that non-forcible measures such as the construction of a wall do not really fall within the concept of self-defence.\n For example, the 'I Love You' virus source code contained the 'signature' of the author.\n For example, the Israeli attack on the Syrian air-defences in advance of an air strike.\n IP spoofing essentially forges the data identifying the sending computer in the header of a data packet so that it appears to originate from a different IP address, thus any response is sent to the forged computer.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nARMED ATTACK AND RESPONSE IN THE DIGITAL AGE\nit is difficult to state with any certainty that the entity that appears to be the perpetrator of the attack is in fact the ultimate attacker.\nIP spoofing can be used either to simply mask the origin of an attack, or in a deliberate attempt to place the blame for an attack on another party. An early example of the latter problem occurred in 1999 when a denial of service attack was launched against the US Department of Transport. The attack appeared to emanate from a server in Maryland run by followers of the Falun Gong movement; in fact, the attack was designed to take down both the Maryland server and the Department of Transport network server, leaving the Falun Gong bearing the blame. However, the attackers had blundered and the attack was traced to a computer located at the address of China's Ministry of Public Security. No information is publicly available regarding the US response to this attack; however, in 2002 Richard Clarke, then White House technology advisor, stated before a Senate Judiciary subcommittee hearing on cyber terrorism that the government had never been able to prove to their satisfaction that a particular government was responsible for a specific unauthorised intrusion.[108]\nThe proliferation of botnets also makes attribution difficult. As the 2007 denial of service attacks against Estonia proved, it can be very difficult to differentiate between attacks that originate from a particular address and those which are merely utilising a compromised computer. Although some of the IP addresses involved in the attacks against Estonia were traced to official IP addresses of Russian state authorities, Russia denied any involvement and claimed that these computers had been compromised and were being manipulated from outside the Kremlin. Subsequent reports by cyber security analysts tend to back this claim, pointing to the lack of evidence and also noting the possibility of spoofing the IP address of the attacker.[109]\nOf course, problems of attribution aren't restricted to cyberspace. Armed attacks following more conventional patterns are often carried out anonymously, or responsibility is claimed by armed groups which appear unlikely to have the resources required for such an attack. Further, in the case of state-sponsored terrorism, it is unlikely that any state will step forward to take responsibility for kinetic acts, let alone electronic ones. Those factors aside, a victim state must still establish\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nATTRIBUTION\na link between the attacking group and the sponsoring state, the same approach must be taken with electronic attacks. This may be particularly difficult to prove where attacks are launched by groups or loose affiliations of individuals in conjunction with traditional state action. For example, when Russia moved troops into South Ossetia following the Georgian offensive in 2008, the air strikes and ground forces were accompanied by a series of computer network attacks against Georgian servers. While these attacks were certainly not serious enough to amount to armed attacks, given Georgia's limited internet connectivity, they illustrate the capacity for other actors to effectively 'join-in' a conflict with or without state authorisation. Several security analysts reported botnets allegedly controlled by the Russian Business Network, a group known to be linked to cyber crime, launching denial of service attacks at Georgian servers. However, software was also freely available for download to individual computers from Russian language websites such as 'stopgeorgia.ru' along with a list of targets, making joining the cyber offensive as simple as a few mouse clicks. As noted previously, the Russian government denies any involvement with the attacks; however, the issue raises the difficult question of state responsibility for non-state actors and the necessity or degree of state involvement or complicity required before force can be used in self-defence against the state. This book does not address this issue in depth; suffice it to note that there is little agreement in the international community on the issue in relation to conventional attacks, let alone computer network attacks. However, it is clear that a state must not knowingly allow its territory to be used as a sanctuary for terrorists or armed bands bent on attacking military targets or civilian objects in another country.\nThe difficulty of attribution also affects the victim state's ability to engage in forcible countermeasures in self-defence.

However, the necessity of waiting for hard evidence of responsibility also opens the possibility that any action taken against a perpetrator once responsibility has been confirmed will be classified as an armed reprisal rather than an action taken in self-defence. Armed reprisals are prohibited under international law.\n## 4. Necessity and proportionality\nAll responses to attacks, whether their means of delivery are kinetic or electronic, are subject to the underlying principles of necessity and proportionality. The International Court of Justice has repeatedly confirmed that self-defence, whether individual or collective, warrants only those measures which are ‘proportional to the armed attack and necessary to respond to it’ as a principle well established in customary international law. The principles are not stated in UN Charter but are often traced back to the Webster formulation in the Caroline incident.\nThe principle of necessity requires that any measures taken avowedly in self-defence must have been necessary for that purpose; the principle is strict and objective ‘leaving no room for any measure of discretion’. That is, it is not sufficient that force is used after an armed attack; it must be necessary to repel that attack, and non-forcible remedies must either prove futile in limine or have in fact been exhausted in an\n Oil Platforms Case, paras 57, 61.\n Dinstein, ‘CNA and Self-Defense’, 111.\n Declaration on Friendly Relations, Principle on the Use of Force, para. 6.\n Nicaragua (Merits), paras 176 and 194; Nuclear Weapons Case, para. 41; Oil Platforms Case, para. 74; Armed Activities Case, para. 147.\n There must be ‘a necessity of defence, instant, overwhelming, leaving no choice of means and no moment for deliberation’.\n Oil Platforms Case, para. 73.\n Greenwood, ‘Pre-Emptive Use of Force’, 23.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nNECESSITY AND PROPORTIONALITY\n\nThe principle of necessity also gives rise to a related principle, namely that actions taken in self-defence must generally be taken without undue delay. In the case of computer network attacks, this may make successful claims of self-defence more difficult. Where the origins of a computer network attack are not obvious, the time taken to conduct computer forensics and establish hard evidence of the identity of the perpetrator may militate against a finding that any subsequent action by the victim state is in self-defence. Similar criticisms were levelled at the United States after a delay of several weeks between the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon and subsequent action in Afghanistan. Likewise, the Court in the *Nicaragua (Merits)* case also criticised the US for commencing activities purportedly in self-defence several months after the major offensive of the opposition against the government of El Salvador had been completely repulsed, although ultimately dismissing the claim of self-defence on other grounds. However, Dinstein notes that this requirement must not be construed too strictly; he points to the delay of approximately five months between the invasion of Kuwait and the authorisation of all necessary means by the Security Council.\nThe principle of proportionality requires the weighing of the response against its permitted purpose of halting and repelling the attack, or, in the case of anticipatory self-defence, preventing it from\n Dinstein, ‘CNA and Self-Defense’, 109.\n Roberto Ago, ‘Addendum to the Eighth Report on State Responsibility’ (1980) II UN Y.B.

Whether or not an act is proportionate will necessarily be dependent on the facts of the situation; however, the action must not be retaliatory or punitive, its lawfulness cannot be measured ‘except by its capacity for achieving the desired result’. This raises an interesting question with respect to computer network attacks; namely whether it would ever be proportionate to use traditional armed force against an electronic attack. The answer must surely be in the affirmative. Proportionality does not restrict the defending state to the same weapons or the same numbers of armed forces as the attacking state; nor is it necessarily limited to action on its own territory. Therefore it would be open to the victim of a computer network attack to use whatever weapons it has at its disposal to repel the attack, as long as the response is proportionate to that purpose. As Ago notes:\nIn the case of self-defence, it was essential to avoid the error of thinking that there should be some proportionality between the action of the aggressor and the action of the state defending itself. Proportionality could be judged only in terms of the objective of the action, which was to repel an attack and prevent it from succeeding. No limitations that might prejudice the success of a response to attack could be placed on the State suffering the attack. The concept of reasonable action must of course enter into the matter, since self-defence could not justify a genuine act of aggression committed in response to an armed attack of limited proportions.\nThus, if a computer network attack is being used to prepare the battlespace for a conventional attack, the use of military force in response must be proportionate in relation to the need to repel the attack as a whole. However, it should be noted that while physically bombing the attacking computers and their owners may be legal, it is not necessarily the preferred method of response. Only a few examples of state intrusion have been made public to date, and no large-scale attacks as would justify a forcible response have been reported. Further, state practice in response to electronic probes emanating from other states have not resulted in forcible responses.\n Ago, ‘Addendum’, 69 para. 121.\n Gray, *Use of Force* (3rd edn), 150.\n Roberto Ago, ‘State Responsibility’ (1980) Vol. 1 *UN Y.B.

Countermeasures against unlawful acts\nWhere a computer network attack does not rise to the level of an armed attack, a state may still respond with proportionate countermeasures. However, where forcible countermeasures are taken in response to an ordinary breach of international law, not constituting an armed attack, they are unlawful.\nHowever, an alternate line of reasoning, arising out of the controversial gap theory put forward by the majority of the International Court of Justice in the Nicaragua (Merits) decision, appears to have muddied the waters somewhat. The Court held that acts committed by Nicaragua against El Salvador, Honduras and Costa Rica amounted to less grave forms of ‘illegal military intervention’. The Court held that that ‘proportionate counter-measures’ were permissible on the part of the victim state; however, they did not create any entitlement by any third state to take collective countermeasures involving the use\nHezbollah telecommunications network. The response was condemned by states; however, given the non-international nature of the dispute, it does not provide any useful indication of state practice in this regard. See generally ‘Hezbollah Takes over West Beirut’, BBC News, 9 May 2008, http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/7391600.stm (last accessed 15 July 2011).\n Jensen, ‘Computer Attacks’, 231.\n Dinstein, War, Aggression, and Self-Defense, 226.\n The Court held that Nicaragua did supply aid to rebels in the territories of El Salvador, but had insufficient evidence of the nature, scale and continuance of such aid. The Court further held that Nicaragua was responsible for certain transborder military incursions into Honduras and Costa Rica. Nicaragua (Merits), paras 152, 164.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nARMED ATTACK AND RESPONSE IN THE DIGITAL AGE\nof force. The Court did not venture an opinion as to what form the individual countermeasures by the victim state might take, or whether they could include the use of force.\nJohn Hargrove has suggested that there are two possible interpretations of the Court’s statement. Either the Court was saying:\n(a) that there are some acts of force that nobody, not even the victim, may resist by proportionate measures of force; or it was saying (b) that the victim may resist with force provided that it does so alone. There is little to be said in explanation of the latter proposition other than it is simply a[n] ... arbitrary announcement of the Court.\nHargrove argues that allowing forcible countermeasures ‘would in one remarkable stroke manage both to impair the right of self-defense, and to weaken fundamentally the prohibition on the use of force by creating an open-ended and wholly new category of exceptions to Article 2(4) of the Charter, of unknown content and limit.’ However, Judge Simma in his separate opinion in the *Oil Platforms* case has argued that the Court in the *Nicaragua (Merits)* case cannot, in the context of that case, have understood that to mean mere pacific reprisals. He argues that the Court can only have meant ‘defensive military action “short of” full-scale self-defence’.\nBut we may encounter also a lower level of hostile military action, not reaching the threshold of an ‘armed attack’ within the meaning of Article 51 of the United Nations Charter. Against such hostile acts, a state may of course defend itself, but only within a more limited range and quality of responses (the main difference being that the possibility of collective self-defence does not arise, cf. *Nicaragua*) and bound to necessity, proportionality and immediacy in time in a particularly strict way.\nSimma’s treatment of the conditions in respect of forcible countermeasures is clearly linked to the classic self-defence analysis, rather\n ‘[A] use of force of a lesser degree of gravity cannot ... produce any entitlement to take collective counter-measures involving the use of force. The acts of which Nicaragua is accused ... could only have justified proportionate counter-measures on the part of the state which had been the victim of these acts, namely El Salvador, Honduras or Costa Rica. They could not justify counter-measures taken by a third state, the United States, and particularly could not justify intervention involving the use of force.’ *Ibid.*, para. 249.\n Hargrove, *Nicaragua Judgement*, 141.\n *Ibid.*, 142.\n *Oil Platforms Case* (per Judge Simma), para. 12.\n *Ibid.*, per Judge Simma, paras 12–13.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOUNTERMEASURES AGAINST UNLAWFUL ACTS\n\nWhere a computer network attack does not amount to an armed attack (or a use of force), any countermeasures taken by the victim state will be conditional on, and limited by, the law relating to countermeasures. In the Case Concerning the Gabcikovo-Nagymaros Project, the International Court of Justice set out a three-part test justifying proportionate countermeasures. First, the action must be taken in response to an internationally wrongful act of another state and be directed against that state. Second, the victim state must have called upon the offending state to discontinue its wrongful conduct or to make reparation for it. And finally, the effects of the countermeasure must be commensurate with the injury suffered, taking account of the rights in question. In this regard the test for proportionality differs between countermeasures and self-defence, where the response must be proportional to the threat, rather than the actual harm suffered. However, the Court also stated that the purpose of the countermeasures must be to induce the wrongdoing state to comply with its obligations under international law, and that the measure must therefore be reversible. In respect of a computer network attack this would seem to fit with current state practice; most attacks to date have merely resulted in states requesting the alleged perpetrator of the attack to cease their actions. However, the nature of computer network attacks, including the type of attacks they make possible and, most importantly, their ability to be reversed, makes computer network attacks particularly useful as a countermeasure against a previous wrongful act of a state. For example, a series\n See generally United Nations, International Law Commission and James Crawford, The International Law Commission's Articles on State Responsibility: Introduction, Text, and Commentaries (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, New York, 2002).\n Case Concerning the Gabcikovo-Nagymaros Project (1997) ICJ Reports 3, International Court of Justice, para. 85.\n Ibid., para. 87.\n Although it should be noted that in all reported cases to date the suspected perpetrator has denied any involvement with the attack.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nARMED ATTACK AND RESPONSE IN THE DIGITAL AGE\nof blackouts in response to an internationally wrongful act may be a useful coercive measure.\nThe 1998 Zapatista ‘Floodnet’ attacks on the Pentagon’s website by the Electronic Disturbance Theatre also provide a model for how electronic countermeasures might work against non-state actors. US Department of Defense specialists created a program that would recognise the Floodnet applet installed on computers trying to access the Department of Defense website. Once the applet was identified, a program was sent back to the activist’s computer to shut down their web browser, thus ending the attack. Although criticisms were levelled at the Department for not thoroughly considering the legal ramifications of such a response, the United States’ decision to respond electronically, in this instance, against an attack which they had been expecting, must be considered a proportionate countermeasure, particularly against a demonstrably non-violent protest group. There was some speculation that this approach was being renewed by the US Department of Defense in its ‘active defence’ policy released in 2011; statements made by Lynn prior to release of the policy indicated that the US intended to stop threats before they reached Department of Defense networks. However, the unclassified version of the Pentagon’s cyber-security strategy appears to focus the concept of active defence on network speed hunting for malicious activity within Department of Defense networks and systems, rather than pushing back beyond the network boundaries. The danger with adopting the push-back approach against states is the risk of escalation of such countermeasures into forcible responses, a situation which the Security Council would be likely to determine a threat to international peace and security, as seen in the following section.\n An applet is a small piece of code designed to perform one specific task within another application.\n Brian Friel, ‘DoD Launches Internet Counterattack’, Government Executive, 18 September 1998, http://govexec.com/dailyfed/0998/091898b1.htm (last accessed 12 April 2011).\n George I.

The Security Council has ‘primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security’ and may recommend or authorise member states to engage in measures, which may include the use of force, in order to pursue this aim. Article 39 provides:\nThe Security Council shall determine the existence of any threat to the peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression and shall make recommendations, or decide what measures shall be taken in accordance with Articles 41 and 42, to maintain or restore international peace and security.\nThis raises two separate issues for the use of computer network attacks. First, when will the Security Council consider computer network attacks to be a ‘threat to the peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression’; and second, under what circumstances might measures authorised by the Security Council under Chapter VII include computer network attacks?\nAs noted, prior to the Security Council recommending action, it must determine that a ‘threat to the peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression’ exists under Article 39. In practice, the Council has almost exclusively exercised its powers by finding a ‘threat to international peace and security’, even in situations where a breach of the peace or act of aggression is obvious; thus the analysis will concentrate on this broader standard. Whether or not there are any limits on the Security Council’s ability to determine a threat to the peace is the subject of debate amongst legal scholars; however, it is generally accepted that the Council possesses considerable discretion in this respect. The resulting range of situations in which the Security Council has found a threat to the peace is increasingly broad and includes the danger of violent countermeasures by states to violations of international law, regardless of their admissibility. The Council has also\n Jochen Frowein, ‘Article 39’ in B.

He argues that a threat to the peace exists when, in a particular situation, a danger of the use of force on a considerable scale arises.[160] Although the Security Council has not considered any computer network attacks to date,[161] based on this assessment it would certainly appear that a computer network attack would constitute a threat to the peace where it is of sufficient gravity that a state is likely to respond to it with force, regardless of whether it is categorised as an armed attack, or where the type of attack indicates further violence to follow, whether electronically or by kinetic means.\nOnce the Security Council has determined a threat to the peace, the Council may make recommendations, or require states to take action under Articles 40, 41 and 42 of the Charter, for the restoration or maintenance of international peace and security. Interestingly, once the Security Council has deemed a situation a threat to the peace, it 'is free to take measures against any entity which it considers to be an obstructive factor in the restoration of peace'.[162] Thus, having determined the\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSECURITY COUNCIL AUTHORISATION AND COLLECTIVE MEASURES\n\nArticle 40 allows the Security Council to establish any provisional measures it deems necessary or desirable to prevent an aggravation of the situation, before deciding what recommendations to make under Article 39. Provisional measures are made without prejudice to the rights, claims or position of the parties, but failure to comply with them will be taken into account by the Security Council.\nArticle 41 allows the Security Council to decide:\n[W]hat measures not involving the use of armed force are to be employed to give effect to its decisions, and it may call upon the Members of the United Nations to apply such measures. These may include complete or partial interruption of economic relations and of rail, sea, air, postal, telegraphic, radio, and other means of communication, and the severance of diplomatic relations. (emphasis added)\nThis would also allow for the disruption of individual internet access, such as that demonstrated by the United States in response to the 1998 attack by the Electronic Disturbance Theatre, and may also allow for the total disconnection of a country from the internet by a third party, in the same manner as the self-imposed internet blackouts attempted internally by regimes in Egypt, Myanmar and Libya. Some attempts have been made to argue that such a measure would be the electronic equivalent of a blockade (which would fall within the forceful measures provided for in Article 42); however, the present author does not consider that this is an appropriate classification, despite the\n SC Res 1127, 1997, cited in ibid.\n James Cowie, ‘What Libya Learned from Egypt’, *Renesys Blog*, 5 March 2011, www.renesys.com/blog/2011/03/what-libya-learned-from-egypt.shtml (last accessed 12 April 2011); Jordan Robertson, ‘The Day Part of the Internet Died: Egypt Goes Dark’, *The Washington Times* 28 January 2011, www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/jan/28/day-part-internet-died-egypt-goes-dark/ (last accessed 12 April 2011); OpenNet Initiative, *Pulling the Plug: A Technical Review of the Internet Shutdown in Burma*, OpenNet Initiative (2007), http://opennet.net/sites/opennet.net/files/ONI_Bulletin_Burma_2007.pdf (last accessed 12 April 2011).\n See media reports following both the Estonian and Georgian denial of service attacks.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nARMED ATTACK AND RESPONSE IN THE DIGITAL AGE\nsevere economic effects that this would undoubtedly have on highly technologically dependent states. Electronic measures under Article 41 could arguably also encompass denial of service attacks launched against the media, banking and telecommunications infrastructure of a state, although the shaping of the response to the threat may prove difficult in practice.\nWhere non-forceful measures have been unsuccessful, or if the Security Council determines that such measures would be inadequate, the Council may authorise action under Article 42 by such air, sea or land forces as may be necessary to maintain or restore international peace and security; examples include demonstrations, blockade and other operations by air, sea or land forces of Members of the United Nations. It appears unlikely that the Security Council would consider it necessary to authorise force against a computer network attack; however, where an attack or ongoing series of attacks cannot be prevented or stopped by electronic means, it is within their purview to do so. As noted earlier, force is not necessarily the preferred means of countering a cyber attack because of the distributed nature of many methods of attack.\nA more interesting scenario is the possibility of the Security Council authorising computer network attacks of sufficient gravity to amount to a use of force in response to a threat to the peace. For example, in the past few years the Security Council has passed a series of resolutions expressing its concern over the proliferation risks presented by the Iranian nuclear programme. Although the Council has not explicitly stated that it considers that the programme represents a threat to international peace and security, this is far from unusual; it is clear from the practice of the Council that no formal pronouncement with an express reference to Article 39 is necessary; the use of the language is apparently sufficient. The Council does, however, explicitly state that it is acting under Article 41 of Chapter VII of the Charter, and each resolution calls for member states to implement a series of specific non-forceful measures against Iran. The author has previously concluded that the Stuxnet worm amounts to a use of force as it is\n For example, the OECD estimates the economic impact of shutting down internet and mobile phone services in Egypt for five days in 2011 at US$90 million in direct costs alone.\n Art. 42, UN Charter.\n SC Res 1929 (2010); SC Res 1803 (2008); SC Res 1747 (2007); SC Res 1737 (2006).\n Gray, Use of Force (3rd edn), 256.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCONCLUSION\n\n## 7. Conclusion\nAs with the discussion in the previous chapter relating to the use of force, the classification of computer network attacks as armed attacks sits on top of a deep doctrinal divide between those who would argue for a wide interpretation of the right to self-defence and those who would restrict it. The present author believes that in regard to computer network attacks, a restrictive view of the armed attack threshold and the subsequent right to self-defence is preferable. Classification of computer network attacks which would amount to armed attacks should therefore be restricted to those attacks which cause physical damage to property or persons of a sufficient scale and effect. Given the particular difficulties and length of time involved in accurately attributing attacks and the fact that states acting in self-defence are not restricted to responding in kind, the danger of computer network attacks escalating into traditional conflict is apparent. That is not to say that states cannot respond to computer network attacks that do not rise to the level of an armed attack; a state may still respond with proportionate countermeasures or appeal to the Security Council for a finding that the attacks amount to a threat to the peace.\n Thus even if Stuxnet had not resulted in physical damage but merely stopped the enrichment facility from working it could not have fallen within the terms of the Security Council authorisations.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press",

At the time of the UK attack the ship was moored in an American port and two US nationals were killed. One of the British officers, Lieutenant McLeod, was later arrested in the United States on charges of murder arising out of the incident. The British government, seeking McLeod’s release, maintained that its forces had acted in self-defence, to which US Secretary of State Daniel Webster replied in what has become the accepted statement of self-defence doctrine at the time.

      "flat_text": "# 3 Armed attack and response in the digital age\nHaving looked at computer network attacks as a prohibited act in the previous chapter, this chapter will look at the exceptions to the prohibition; the permissible response to the prohibited act. The UN Charter system admits only two exceptions to the prohibition on the use of force: collective measures authorised by the Security Council acting under Chapter VII of the Charter; or the inherent right of collective or individual self-defence provided for in Article 51.\nThe exact scope of the right of self-defence remains one of the divisive issues in international law, so it is not surprising that its application to the topic of computer network attacks is particularly complex. First, it is difficult to identify the point at which a computer network attack will rise to the level of an 'armed attack', the threshold that triggers a state's right to self-defence. As seen in the previous chapter, traditional international law focuses on personal injury, fatality and damage to physical property as measures of the seriousness of an attack. This approach is favoured by most commentators writing on the subject to date; however, many catastrophically damaging computer network attacks will not cause any of these deleterious consequences. Further, it is likely that many attacks using computer network operations will not come as a single instance, but rather as a series of events which, taken separately, may not be sufficient to qualify as an armed attack. This raises the issue of the right to respond to 'pin-prick' attacks with a single use of force, a concept which has had a chequered history in international law. The likelihood that computer network attacks will\n See Horace B. Robertson, 'Self-Defense against Computer Network Attack under International Law' in M. N. Schmitt and B. T. O'Donnell (eds.), Computer Network Attack and International Law (Naval War College, Newport, RI, 2002) 122–45, 136, for examples of authors adopting the consequence-based approach.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nARMED ATTACK AND RESPONSE IN THE DIGITAL AGE\nbe used in conjunction with, or as a precursor to, a conventional attack may also raise a right to respond to such attacks under the auspices of the controversial doctrine of anticipatory self-defence. For example, will intrusion into an air defence network be sufficient evidence of an imminent attack following the 2007 Israeli raid on the alleged Syrian nuclear site.\nThe second major difficulty with computer network attacks, as opposed to traditional kinetic attacks, is the difficulty of attributing an attack to its original perpetrator. The length of time required to trace an attack makes questions of the necessity of force to repel a computer network attack difficult to satisfy. Questions of proportionality also arise in determining whether it would ever be proportionate to use armed force in response to a computer network attack. This chapter examines these questions in light of current international law, the definition of armed attack and considers in what circumstances force may be used in self-defence against a computer network attack.\nThe final sections address the authorisation to use force under the auspices of Chapter VII Security Council resolutions, and what measures might be taken by states in response to computer network attacks which fail to meet the threshold for lawful self-defence.\n# 1. Armed attack\nThe right of self-defence is a customary law right, inherent in the sovereignty of states; it has been codified for the most part by Article 51 of the UN Charter as follows:\nNothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security. Measures taken by Members in the exercise of this right of self-defence shall be immediately reported to the Security Council and shall not in any way affect the authority and responsibility of the Security Council under the present Charter to take at any time such action as it deems necessary in order to maintain or restore international peace and security.\nThe customary status of the right has been confirmed by the Nicaragua (Merits) case. Article 51 of the Charter allows self-defence in response to an 'armed attack' and the International Court of Justice has\n Nicaragua (Merits), para. 176.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nARMED ATTACK\nconfirmed in both the Nicaragua (Merits) and Oil Platforms decisions that nothing short of an armed attack (with the possible exception of an anticipated armed attack) will be sufficient to trigger the right of self-defence under international law. The Oil Platforms case also established that it is for the state using force in self-defence to prove that it has been subjected to an armed attack. However, as with the term ‘force’, the Charter does not provide a definition of ‘armed attack’. Further, the historical predecessors to the Charter system do not offer any interpretive assistance. Neither the Kellogg-Briand Pact nor the Covenant of the League of Nations refer to the term. Both formulate self-defence as a response to aggression; hence all attempts at definition were focused on that term. The drafting history of the Charter provides evidence that discussions took place on the difference between an attack and an armed attack (based on the fact that the United States draft of 11 May 1945 contained both terms) and although no definitive conclusion was reached, the term was replaced by armed attack only. Professor Ian Brownlie has pointed out that it is likely that the records of the San Francisco conference contain no definition of the phrase ‘armed attack’ because the term was considered ‘sufficiently clear’ and ‘self-evident’. That was certainly the case in the drafting of the North Atlantic Treaty around the same time, as evidenced by the comments of the Foreign Relations Committee of the United States Senate which noted that the phrase ‘armed attack’ in Article 5 ‘is ordinarily self evident’ and ‘there is rarely, if ever, any doubt as to whether it has occurred or by whom it was launched’. The decision of the International Court of Justice in the Nicaragua (Merits) case made clear that armed attacks form a subset of the term ‘force’ in Article 2(4); therefore those actions which have been discussed in the previous chapter as falling outside the ambit of the definition of armed force will subsequently also fail to meet the threshold of an armed attack. However, not every use of force will be an armed attack,\n Ibid.; Case Concerning Oil Platforms (Islamic Republic of Iran v. United States of America) (2003), International Court of Justice, para. 51.\n Oil Platforms Case, para. 57.\n Stanimir A.

However, the Court fails to specify what that agreement might be, confining itself to citing the following example:\nIn particular, it may be considered to be agreed that an armed attack must be understood as including not merely action by regular armed forces across an international border, but also ‘the sending by or on behalf of a State of armed bands, groups, irregulars or mercenaries, which carry out acts of armed force against another State of such gravity as to amount to’ (inter alia) an actual armed attack conducted by regular forces, ‘or its substantial involvement therein’ ... The Court sees no reason to deny that, in customary law, the prohibition of armed attacks may apply to the sending by a State of armed bands to the territory of another State, if such an operation, because of its scale and effects, would have been classified as an armed attack rather than as a mere frontier incident had it been carried out by regular armed forces.\nThe Court goes on to consider that acts such as ‘assistance to rebels in the form of the provision of weapons or logistical or other support’ do not constitute an armed attack, but might nonetheless constitute a threat or use of force, or amount to intervention in the internal or external affairs of other states. Despite being the subject of much criticism and discussion, the Court’s decision makes clear that under current international law the definition of ‘armed attack’ is dependent on the ‘scale and effects’ of an attack which must be of sufficient gravity to elevate such actions beyond ‘mere frontier incidents’. The view that an armed attack must be of ‘relatively large scale and with substantial effect’ is reiterated by several leading scholars, and is in\n Nicaragua (Merits), para. 195.

Logically and pragmatically the gap has to be quite narrow, inasmuch as 'there is very little effective protection against states violating the prohibition on the use of force, as long as they do not resort to an armed attack'.^[16] Michael Schmitt has commented that this distinction makes sense in light of the Charter's central purpose to 'maintain international peace and security' as it creates a rebuttable presumption against the resort by states to violence.^[17] Thus he notes 'it is logical to interpret the prohibition on the use of force expansively, but characterize exceptions that lie outside the community decisional architecture, such as self-defense, narrowly'.^[18]\nOther commentators, including Judge Simma in a separate opinion in the Oil Platforms case, have argued, however, that it makes no logical sense to prohibit a state from forcibly defending itself or permitting its allies to come to the state's defence where it is the subject of an unlawful use of force.^[19] Any fears of an unwarranted escalation of an incident can be dealt with under the existing rules pertaining to proportionality.^[20] Despite such debate, following the Nicaragua (Merits) and\n^[14] The Security Council may determine whether actions falling under the examples given in Article 3 do not constitute 'acts of aggression' owing to their lack of gravity.

However, the thresholds of each of these concepts, and the responses which each allows, are yet to be established with any certainty.\nThis uncertainty makes the classification of any computer network attack particularly difficult. As noted previously, the possible effects of computer network attacks 'span the spectrum of consequentiality',[21] thus making classification based on the type of computer network attack impossible; each attack must be assessed on its merits. It seems certain, however, that where a computer network attack causes destruction and fatalities on a par with a conventional attack, a state will have a right to respond in self-defence. This is the conclusion reached in a report by the Office of General Counsel of the US Department of Defense, which concluded:[22]\n[I]f a coordinated computer network attack shuts down a nation's air traffic control system along with its banking and financial systems and public utilities, and opens the floodgates of several dams resulting in general flooding that causes widespread civilian deaths and property damage, it may well be that no-one would challenge a victim nation if it concluded that it was the victim of an armed attack, or of an act equivalent to an armed attack.\nWhile undoubtedly correct, the report fails to separate and analyse the attack in its component parts, combining those components which directly cause death and destruction with less severe attacks. Schmitt focuses on the consequences of the attack rather than on the object of the attack or on the intentions of the attacker; the exception being where the intentions of the attacker are specifically to cause physical damage to tangible objects or injury to human beings, in which case Schmitt considers the resort to armed force is permitted.[23] He argues that self-defence should be limited to operations which are de facto armed attacks, or imminently preparatory thereto; the net result being a limitation on both sides to resort to computer network attack techniques which might threaten global stability and on individual responses which might themselves prove destabilising.[24]\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nARMED ATTACK\nIn contrast, Walter Sharp, one of the early authors on the subject, argues that any intrusion into systems containing information which is critical to the national security of the victim state should be considered an armed attack capable of triggering the right to respond with force. This idea is premised on the notion that the features of modern society and its reliance on information systems are such that non-military means can often cause more harm than military ones. However Sharp’s ‘strict liability’ approach has not been borne out by state practice, which to date has recognised such intrusions as simple espionage, an act not prohibited under international law.\nThe present author considers that the threshold for an armed attack conducted by computer network attack must be set in line with current international law regulating the right of self-defence. A state is therefore permitted to respond in self-defence when it is the victim of a computer network attack causing damage to property or persons of sufficient scale and effect to elevate it beyond the equivalent of a frontier incident. The denial of service attacks against Estonia in 2007, disruptive as they were, did not reach this level; neither did the attacks launched the following year against Georgia, although the analysis of that incident is complicated by the subsequent conventional attacks by Russia. No loss of life, physical injury or destruction of property was suffered as a result of the computer network operations launched against either state. In contrast, the 2010 Stuxnet worm has purportedly resulted in significant destruction of property. At the time of writing, reports indicate that the worm may be responsible for Iran having to replace 1,000 of the 9,000 IR-1 centrifuges at the Natanz nuclear fuel enrichment facility. While reports of the effect of the worm on the facility and the resulting impact on Iran’s nuclear programme have differed wildly, a report by the Institute for Science and International Security detailing the effect of Stuxnet has concluded that while the effects of the worm were significant, the effect on Iran’s nuclear programme was only moderate:\n Sharp, Cyberspace and the Use of Force, 129.\n Ibid., 101–2.\n The question of the cyber attacks acting as an indication of imminent armed attacks is addressed in the following section on anticipatory self-defence.\n David Albright, Paul Brannan and Christina Walrond, Stuxnet Malware and Natanz: Update of ISIS December 22, 2010 Report, Institute for Science and International Security (2011) 3.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nARMED ATTACK AND RESPONSE IN THE DIGITAL AGE\nWhile it has delayed the Iranian Centrifuge program at the Natanz plant in 2010 and contributed to slowing its expansion, it did not stop it or even delay the continued build up of [low enriched uranium]\nThat being the case, it would appear that while the Stuxnet worm would undoubtedly amount to a use of force, the scale and effects of the attack do not appear to have sufficient gravity to amount to an armed attack.\n## 1.1. Anticipatory self-defence\nIt is likely that computer network attacks will be used in conjunction with, or as a prelude to, a traditional armed attack. Such attacks designed to 'prepare the battle space' can come in a myriad of forms, including the disablement of intelligence-gathering sensors such as satellites and radar posts via computer network attack, disruption of military communications networks leaving units isolated and unable to be scrambled, or, on the civilian level, disablement of emergency response networks may be launched in anticipation of more traditional kinetic action to follow. It is certainly clear that states are considering how a combination of electronic and traditional attacks might be used in the future. For example, the US actively looked for computer network solutions prior to the 2003 invasion of Iraq and China is openly looking for an 'assassin's mace' to address the perceived asymmetry of the Chinese military against the US in conventional conflicts, widely believed to incorporate computer network attacks. As Robertson points out, in modern warfare the electronic battlefield will play a crucial role, and any steps that a prospective attacker can take to neutralise or destroy its enemy's command and control, intelligence, communications, or weapons-control networks prior to a traditional attack would gain an enormous advantage. This advantage was seen in the 2007 Israeli attack on the suspected Syrian nuclear site where the air defence radar did not detect the attacking planes until they were disappearing back over the border. One might also look to the role of the distributed denial of service attacks against Georgia in 2008 which preceded the physical invasion by Russia. While such attacks may not be sufficient\n David A. Fulghum, ‘Frustrations and Backlogs’, *Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology* 10, 10 March 2003, 33. According to reports these attempts were never put into action due to the interconnectedness of the target systems with foreign-owned networks.\n Robertson, ‘Self-Defense against CNA’, 139.\n See Fulghum, Wall and Butler, ‘Israel Shows Electronic Prowess’.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nARMED ATTACK\nto amount to an armed attack in and of themselves, as preparatory moves in a conventional attack they may be sufficient to justify the use of force under the doctrine of anticipatory self-defence.\n## 1.1.1. Doctrinal debate and imminent attacks\nThere is no consensus in international legal doctrine over the point in time from which measures of self-defence against an armed attack may be taken. In particular, states and commentators are divided over whether a right of anticipatory self-defence exists in international law. The debate centres on whether anticipatory self-defence survived the implementation of Article 51 of the UN Charter, which states that nothing in the Charter ‘shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs’. Those arguing for a restrictive interpretation of the clause interpret this to mean that the right of self-defence is now only available to member states who are the object of an actual armed attack. Gray, Kelsen and Brownlie are some of the leading proponents of this view, which is based on the premise that the Charter forbids any use of force on the part of individual members except for the right of self-defence against an armed attack.\nThose arguing for a more expansive approach point out that Article 51 specifically reserves the ‘inherent right’ of self-defence, and the customary right includes the right to respond to an imminent armed attack. Although ultimately disagreeing with the position, Bothe points out that many authors acknowledge that a threat may be so direct and overwhelming that it is just not feasible to require the victim to wait to act in self-defence until the act has actually started. Other authors have addressed this problem by adopting a broader notion\n Randelzhofer, ‘Article 51’, 803.\n Bowett, *Self-Defence*, 188. See also Brownlie, *Use of Force by States*, 275; Ian Brownlie, *International Law and the Use of Force by States: Revisited* (Europaeum, Oxford, 2001); Randelzhofer, ‘Article 51’, 803–4; Christine D. Gray, *International Law and the Use of Force* (3rd edn, Oxford University Press, 2008), 160; Dinstein, *War, Aggression, and Self-Defense*, 183.\n Authors subscribing to this expansive view include Thomas M. Franck, *Recourse to Force: State Action against Threats and Armed Attacks* (Cambridge University Press, 2002), 97; Bowett, *Self-Defence*, 187–92; Christopher Greenwood, ‘International Law and the Pre-Emptive Use of Force: Afganistan, Al-Qaida, and Iraq’ (2003) 4 San Diego Int’l L.J. 7; Robert Y. Jennings and C. Arthur H. Watts (eds.), *Oppenheim’s International Law* (9th edn, Longman, Harlow, 1992), 421.\n Michael Bothe, ‘Terrorism and the Legality of Pre-Emptive Force’ (2003) 14(2) EJIL 227, 231.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nARMED ATTACK AND RESPONSE IN THE DIGITAL AGE\nof when an armed attack has occurred in the context of Article 51. For example, while expressly rejecting the notion of anticipatory self-defence, Yoram Dinstein nevertheless incorporates actions taken in advance of an actual attack by moving the timing of the beginning of the attack, a concept he calls ‘interceptive’ self-defence. Dinstein argues that the beginning of an armed attack is not linked to the first shot but rather to the moment of irrevocable commitment to the attack. Once the die has been cast, the armed attack can be said to have commenced and the victim state need not ‘wait impotently for the inescapable blow’. This concept has echoes in the ‘target locking’ arguments of some states in respect of modern precision-guided missiles. For example, the US argues that an armed attack begins when the radar guiding the missile is locked on and ready to fire, and the rules of engagement of their armed forces reflect this approach. Although, as Lindsay Moir points out, whether such an approach truly distinguishes between an armed attack which has begun but not yet reached the target state, and an armed attack that has not begun but is imminent, is open to question.\nThe standard to be applied for taking action in anticipation of an attack was set out by US Secretary of State Daniel Webster in his letter regarding the Caroline incident of 1837. In his now classic formulation, he stated that the right of self-defence only arises where there is ‘a necessity of self-defence, instant, overwhelming, leaving no choice of means, and no moment for deliberation’. Christopher Greenwood\n Dinstein, War, Aggression, and Self-Defense, 187.\n Dinstein, ‘CNA and Self-Defense’, 111.\n Gray, Use of Force (2nd edn), 108, n. 48. For example, in 1998 US aircraft in the no-fly zone over Iraq fired at a missile battery when its radar had locked on to the planes patrolling the zone. Although there was controversy over whether the radar had locked on, the idea that the armed attack had started when the radar locked on was apparently accepted by Iraq and other states: Keesings (1998) 42368.\n Lindsay Moir, Reappraising the Resort to Force: International Law, Jus Ad Bellum and the War on Terror (Hart, Oxford, 2010), 16.\n In that incident, UK forces captured, fired and sent over the Niagara Falls a merchant vessel called the Caroline which was being used by Canadian rebels and their American forces in attacks against passing British ships. At the time of the UK attack the ship was moored in an American port and two US nationals were killed. One of the British officers, Lieutenant McLeod, was later arrested in the United States on charges of murder arising out of the incident. The British government, seeking McLeod’s release, maintained that its forces had acted in self-defence, to which US Secretary of State Daniel Webster replied in what has become the accepted statement of self-defence doctrine at the time. The Caroline Case (1837) 29 BFSP 1137-8.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nARMED ATTACK\npoints out that the Caroline test was applied by the international military tribunals at Nuremburg and Tokyo, suggesting that the right to respond in self-defence against imminent attacks was part of the customary law right preserved by Article 51 of the Charter. The preservation of an inherent right of self-defence and the existence of customary rights outside the Charter wording is also recognised by the Court in the Nicaragua (Merits) case, which noted that the Charter does not contain all the rules pertaining to self-defence, notably a definition of armed attack and the requirement of necessity and proportionality in any response. The Court expressly did not comment on the lawfulness of an anticipatory response to an imminent armed attack as it was not required on the facts of the case. The Court’s approach in avoiding the difficult questions of self-defence and expressly stating no view on anticipatory self-defence has been followed in both the Wall and Armed Activities cases. Two recent UN reports have not been so reluctant, however. The 2004 report of the UN Secretary-General’s High Level Panel concluded that there was an existing right of anticipatory self-defence against imminent attacks, basing their conclusion on customary international law. Likewise the Report of the Secretary-General the following year expresses the view that responses to imminent threats are fully covered by Article 51 of the Charter.\n## 1.1.2. State practice\nThe content of any customary right of anticipatory self-defence must be examined in light of state practice since the inception of the Charter. While state practice is far from conclusive on the matter, two instances in particular tend to indicate that the doctrine has survived. The first is the Israeli-Arab war of 1967. In the wake of escalating tensions between Syria and Israel, Egypt requested the removal of a United Nations emergency force from Egyptian territory, reinforced troops in the Sinai and dispatched troops to Jordan. Egyptian President Nasser also closed the Straits of Tiran to Israeli shipping (an act that Israel had\n Greenwood, ‘Pre-Emptive Use of Force’, 13.\n Nicaragua (Merits), para. 176.\n Ibid., para. 194.\n The Wall Case; Armed Activities Case, para. 143.\n United Nations, A More Secure World: Our Shared Responsibility.

In response to these actions Israel launched strikes against Egypt's airbases, completely destroying the Egyptian air force. Israel justified its actions in the Security Council by claiming that it had been attacked first, but also by reference to a series of acts of sabotage from Syria, and stressed both the character of the Egyptian blockade as an act of war and ‘perhaps more imminent than anything else, this vast and purposeful encirclement movement’ caused by the transfer of large numbers of Egyptian forces to their ‘very gates’. Gray rejects this incident as evidence of an acceptance of anticipatory self-defence, stating that ‘whatever position is taken on the facts of the outbreak of the Six Day War, the point of importance here is that Israel did not claim to be acting in anticipatory self-defence’. However, Franck notes that Israel’s ‘words and actions clearly asserted a right of anticipatory self-defence against an imminent armed attack’. In emphasising the fact that neither the Security Council nor the General Assembly condemned Israel’s actions, Franck comments:\nMost states, on the basis of the evidence available to them, did however conclude that such an armed attack was imminent, that Israel had reasonably surmised that it stood a better chance of survival if the attack were pre-empted, and that, therefore, in the circumstances, it had not acted unreasonably. This does not amount to an open-ended endorsement of a general right to anticipatory self-defense, but it does recognize that, in demonstrable circumstances of extreme necessity, anticipatory self-defense may be a legitimate exercise of a State’s right to ensure its survival.\nThis accords with the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice in the Nuclear Weapons case, which indirectly commented on the situation when the majority of judges were unable to conclude that the first use of nuclear weapons would invariably be unlawful if the very existence of the state were threatened.\n For a full exposition of the facts of this incident see generally A. Mark Weisburd, Use of Force: The Practice of States since World War II (Pennsylvania State University Press, 1997), 135.\n UN SCOR, 1348th Meeting, 6 June 1967, UN Doc.

In most cases the reaction was based on a conclusion that Israel had failed to demonstrate that there was an imminent threat from Iraq and had thus failed to satisfy the Caroline requirements for anticipatory self-defence rather than a general dismissal of a right of anticipatory self-defence.54 As Greenwood points out, the emphasis on this failure to demonstrate the existence of the imminent threat tends, if anything, to confirm the existence of a right of self-defence in cases where such an imminent threat was shown to exist.55 He goes on to cite Rosalyn Higgins, who notes:56\n[I]n a nuclear age, common sense cannot require one to interpret an ambiguous provision in a text in a way that requires a state passively to accept its fate before it can defend itself. And, even in the face of conventional warfare, this would also seem the only realistic interpretation of the contemporary right of self-defence. It is the potentially devastating consequences of prohibiting self-defence unless an armed attack has already occurred that leads one to prefer this interpretation – although it has to be said that, as a matter of simple construction of the words alone, another conclusion might be reached.\nIn assessing what will constitute an imminent attack, Greenwood argues that there are two additional factors which must be taken into account which did not exist at the time of the Caroline incident:57\nThe first is the gravity of the threat. The threat posed by a nuclear weapon, or a biological or chemical weapon, if used against a city, is so horrific that it is in a different league from the threats posed (as in the Caroline) by cross-border raids conducted by men armed only with rifles. Where the threat is an attack by weapons of mass destruction, the risk imposed upon a State by waiting until that attack actually takes place compounded by the impossibility for that State to afford its population any effective protection once the attack has been launched, mean that such an attack can reasonably be treated as imminent in circumstances where an attack by conventional means would not be so regarded. The second consideration is the method of delivery of the threat. It is far more difficult to determine the time scale within which a threat of\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nARMED ATTACK AND RESPONSE IN THE DIGITAL AGE\nattack by terrorist means would materialize than it is with threats posed by, for example, regular armed forces. These would be material considerations in assessing whether, in any particular case, an attack should be treated as imminent.\nAlthough the existence of a right of anticipatory self-defence remains controversial, it is the view of the present author that a right of self-defence against an imminent attack is established in customary international law. The idea of computer network attacks as an indicator of an imminent attack is discussed in the following section.\n### 1.1.3. Computer network attacks and anticipatory self-defence\nThere are two situations where anticipatory self-defence may be implicated in the information warfare context: first, where a computer network attack serves as an imminent threat of a conventional attack; and secondly, where electronic activity indicates a severe computer network attack (which rises to the level of an armed attack) is imminent.\nAs with any assessment of an imminent attack the context of a computer network attack must be taken into account. Where a computer network attack is launched as a precursor to conventional attack, the target will be important. If an attack targets early warning systems, radar posts or satellite feeds, military communications, or emergency response systems it is likely that a state will judge a traditional attack to be imminent. The Israeli attack against the Syrian air-defence network is a case in point. Had Syria become aware of the intrusion and manipulation of its air-defence radar prior to the attack, they would have been entitled to use force in response. Indeed most military forces would claim that the neutralisation of the air-defence network was the beginning of the attack itself, and would certainly be included under Dinstein’s interceptive self-defence analysis.\nThe disruption of electrical power grids or financial systems, on the other hand, is unlikely to be sufficiently indicative of a subsequent conventional attack when viewed in isolation. Thus when Estonia was subject to distributed denial of service attacks against its banking, media and governmental sites, there were no realistic fears that this signalled the beginning of a traditional armed attack. The additional variables, such as positive attribution to a particular actor and possible motivation, are too many and too varied. However, when such attacks are viewed in conjunction with other contextual indicators, states may be more likely to conclude that a conventional attack is imminent.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nARMED ATTACK\nThe 2008 conflict between Russia and Georgia over South Ossetia illustrates the dangers associated with such an attribution, however. That conflict took place in an atmosphere of increased tensions between the states and in the face of skirmishes between separatist forces and the Georgian military. Prior to the physical invasion, a series of distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks were launched against the Georgian government, and media targets and commentators have noted the close coordination between the targets of the computer network attacks in specific areas and the later physical strikes.58 While it is tempting to conclude that the computer network attacks were indicative of the imminent physical invasion, analysts agree that there is no link evident between the Russian government and the attacks, and that patriotic hackers were behind the electronic disruptions.59 Given the increasing frequency with which hacktivist groups launch such denial of service attacks to further their causes or protest political decisions, it seems unlikely that states will be able to rely on such attacks as indicators even, and perhaps especially, in times of increased political tension.\nThe second instance where a computer network attack may be evidence of an imminent armed attack is the use of computer network intrusions to prepare an electronic battlespace. Viruses, worms, Trojan horses and other forms of malware routinely infect unprotected computers with malicious code which may corrupt data, cause a malfunction, record keystrokes, disable virus protection and collect other information such as passwords and other access codes, feeding them back to a remote attacker. One of the most common features of these types of malware is some form of backdoor payload which allows the attacker to access and control the computer at a later date. Such malware is most often used to 'recruit' unprotected computers to vast networks of compromised computers called botnets. Usually used for spam or criminal enterprise, the controllers of the botnet can also use the command and control servers of the botnet to direct the sending of large amounts of traffic to particular IP addresses, bringing them, and\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nARMED ATTACK AND RESPONSE IN THE DIGITAL AGE\nin some cases the transmission routes, to a standstill in a DDoS attack. Botnets have been utilised in most major DDoS attacks reported to date, including against Estonia in 2007 and Georgia in 2008.\nThe inclusion of backdoor payloads in malware raises interesting questions in relation to anticipatory self-defence. It is clear that a backdoor has no other purpose than to allow an intruder control over the infected computer (whether by direct intrusion or remote control) at a later date. A question which must then be addressed is whether a state has the right to respond in anticipatory self-defence against the perpetrators of a computer network attack with a backdoor payload. Although a backdoor can be used for attacks at any point until it is discovered and removed, and such attacks may have far more serious consequences, including those which would qualify as an armed attack, in most cases, the later use is to send spam or launch DDoS attacks causing inconvenience and only economic damage. Without further information about the purpose or target of any later attack, the mere creation of a backdoor by a state adversary is not indicative of the type or gravity of the attack to follow; indeed the creation of a backdoor may merely be evidence of espionage. Most importantly from a legal perspective, the existence of a backdoor would not meet the ‘imminent’ criteria for lawful self-defence, as the timescale for any subsequent attack is variable; the attack could be launched within days or years.\nOther network intrusions may more indicative, but they will be highly dependent on the circumstances. Two points deserve comment. First, the method of delivery means that there may be little warning of an impending computer network attack; this was one of Greenwood’s additional factors to be considered when determining whether an attack is imminent. However, Greenwood’s second factor, the gravity of threat, will depend entirely on the individual threat; as pointed out in the previous chapter, one of the difficulties with assessing computer\n See, for example, Gadi Evron, ‘Battling Botnets and Online Mobs’ (2008) 9(1) GJIA 121, 124; Tikk, Kaska and Vihul, Cyber Incidents.\n A backdoor is a piece of code which opens a hidden or undocumented access point to the compromised computer or system, bypassing the authentication and security protocols and allowing remote access.\n Backdoors have been found on computers allegedly compromised by Chinese hackers.\n Greenwood, ‘Pre-Emptive Use of Force’, 16.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nARMED ATTACK\n\n## 1.1.4. The ‘Bush doctrine’ of pre-emptive self-defence65\nIn 2002 and 2006 the United States released two security strategy documents containing what appears to be a highly controversial attempt at enlarging the right to self-defence to include the use of force to preempt an attack which is merely threatened, but is not imminent. As Gray points out, there is some uncertainty as to the exact scope of the US claims; however, international criticism of the ‘Bush doctrine’ was both widespread and fierce.66 The 2002 National Security Strategy provided that:67\nWe must be prepared to stop rogue states and their terrorist clients before they are able to threaten or use weapons of mass destruction against the United States and our allies ...\n... Legal scholars and international jurists often conditioned the legitimacy of pre-emption on the existence of an imminent threat – most often a visible mobilization of armies, navies, and air forces preparing to attack.\nWe must adapt the concept of imminent threat to the capabilities and objectives of today’s adversaries ... The greater the threat, the greater is the risk of inaction – and the more compelling the case for taking anticipatory action to defend ourselves, even if uncertainty remains as to the time and place of the enemy’s attack. To forestall or prevent such hostile acts by our adversaries, the United States will, if necessary, act pre-emptively.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nARMED ATTACK AND RESPONSE IN THE DIGITAL AGE\nThe sentiments of the 2002 report are repeated in the National Security Strategy 2006. While at first glance, this may appear to extrapolate logically based on the contingencies of modern weaponry, it compromises the basic premise of anticipatory self-defence laid down in the Caroline case and the evidence of state practice which has evolved the doctrine since. Greenwood has noted, far from removing the requirement of imminence ‘... practice also shows that the right of anticipatory self-defence is confined to instances where the armed attack is imminent’. As noted above, while Greenwood accepts that the notion of imminence must take into account the gravity of the threat and its method of deliverance, he goes on to state: ‘In so far as talk of a doctrine of “pre-emption” is intended to refer to a broader right of self-defence to respond to threats that might materialize at some time in the future, such a doctrine has no basis in law.’ The issue has been debated extensively in the legal literature and will not be repeated here, save to say that state practice has not indicated widespread support for the doctrine, and both UN reports on security have rejected any wider right of pre-emptive self-defence, indicating it is for the Security Council to take pre-emptive action. In 2010 legal commentators watched with interest to see what the policy of the new US administration would be. However they were to be disappointed; while downplaying the idea of pre-emption, the Obama administration’s National Security Strategy 2010 does not dismiss it, merely stating that states must ‘adhere to standards that govern the use of force’ without elaborating further on what those standards might be. The relevance of this apparent\n White House, National Security Strategy of the United States of America (White House, 2006), 23. Although Gray notes the striking absence of any express reference to international law, the 2006 report does state that ‘the United States will, if necessary, act pre-emptively in exercising our inherent right of self-defense’, most likely an implicit reference to Art. 51 of the Charter: Christine D.

Pinprick attacks or accumulation of events theory\nComputer network attacks falling below the armed attack threshold may still trigger a forcible response by states. The most likely strategy utilising computer network attacks is to launch a swarm of lesser attacks, rather than a single large strike qualifying as an armed attack. In a short story published in 1998, John Arquilla detailed what a sustained cyber attack might look like:77 power blackouts, followed by weekly virus attacks of the magnitude of the Nimda, Slammer or Mydoom viruses, oil pipeline ruptures all launched within a matter of days of one another. While some of these attacks may cross the threshold of uses of force under Article 2(4), it is unlikely that any taken on their own would be considered an armed attack under current international law. An analogy may be drawn with cases of repeated cross-border incursions. States have claimed a right to act in self-defence\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nARMED ATTACK AND RESPONSE IN THE DIGITAL AGE\nagainst a series of small-scale incursions or attacks as collectively amounting to a single armed attack. The ‘pinprick’ or ‘accumulation of events’ theory has been unsuccessfully argued in the past by several states, including the United Kingdom, the United States, South Africa and Israel, in an attempt to justify actions purportedly taken in self-defence, that might otherwise be disproportionate. Although the Security Council rejected the claims by these states, each time it has done so on the specific facts of the case and on grounds that such actions were disproportionate. In each instance the condemnation by the Security Council suggested that the actions were unlawful reprisals, rather than commenting on the doctrinal issue of the scope of self-defence. Likewise, the International Court of Justice has avoided expressly discussing the issue, although it appears willing to contemplate the possibility of an accumulation of events amounting to an armed attack. The Court in the Nicaragua (Merits) case commented with regard to the incursions by Nicaragua into the territory of Honduras and Costa Rica:\nVery little information is available to the Court as to the circumstances of these incursions or to their possible motivations, which renders it difficult to decide whether they may be treated for legal purposes as amounting, singly or collectively, to an ‘armed attack’ by Nicaragua on either or both States.\n In 1964 the Southern Arab Federation (SAF) which had military links with the United Kingdom, complained of an armed attack by the Yemen which consisted of a ‘series of aggressions’; invoking collective self-defence at the SAF’s request, the UK launched an air strike and destroyed a fort. The Security Council did not accept the reasoning and issued a statement condemning reprisals as ‘incompatible with the principles and purposes of the UN’. SC Res 188, 9 April 1964, as cited in Jean Combacau, ‘The Exception of Self Defence in U.N Practice’ in A. Cassese (ed.), The Current Legal Regulation of the Use of Force (Martinus Nijhoff, Dordrecht, 1986) 9–38, 27.\n The US claimed it was acting in self-defence against alleged attacks by North Vietnamese naval vessels in the Gulf of Tonkin. Letter of 17 February 1979, S/13094 (SCOR, 36th Year) cited in ibid., 17.\n The Security Council has rejected claims of self-defence by Israel made to justify incursions into neighbouring states to attack Palestinian bases, when it attacked Jordan in 1966 (SC Res 228, 25 November 1966) and 1969 (SC Res 265, 1 April 1969), and Lebanon in 1969 (SC Res 270, 16 August 1969), 1970 (SC Res 279, 12 May 1970), 1972 (SC Res 313, 28 February 1972), 1973 (SC Res 332, 21 April 1973) and 1974 (SC Res 347, 24 April 1974). See ibid.\n Gray, Use of Force (3rd edn), 155.\n Nicaragua (Merits), para. 231. It should be noted that the Court found that there had not been an armed attack by Nicaragua based on additional circumstances.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSELF-DEFENCE AGAINST NON-STATE ACTORS\n\nOne final point should be noted: not all attacks which are launched from multiple computers will require a cumulative approach to qualify as an armed attack. A DDoS attack of sufficient scale and effect to elevate it above a ‘mere frontier incident’ would be considered a single attack as the attack originates from a single controller. That is, although the attack appears to come from large numbers of computers in disparate locations, the compromised computers all receive their attack and targeting instructions via command and control servers manipulated from a single controlling ‘master’ which directs the botnet. This is merely the electronic equivalent of an attack using more than one soldier, or a wave of bombers in an air strike.\n## 2. Self-defence against non-state actors\nOne of the most difficult issues in contemporary jus ad bellum is the permitted response of states to attacks by non-state actors. The difficulty\n Case Concerning the Land and Maritime Boundary between Cameroon and Nigeria (Cameroon v. Nigeria: Equatorial Guinea Invervening) (2002) ICJ Reports, International Court of Justice, para. 323; Oil Platforms Case, para. 64; Armed Activities Case, para. 146.\n Oil Platforms Case, para. 64.\n See section 3, below.\n For a detailed description of DDoS attacks, see Bennett Todd, Distributed Denial of Service Attacks (2000), www.linuxsecurity.com/resource_files/intrusion_detection/ddos-faq.html (last accessed 12 April 2011).\n In traditional botnets this is generally through an Internet Relay Chat (IRC) Server. In newer peer-to-peer based botnets, such as the Storm worm, the controller publishes commands at specific keys in the network to be found by infected machines. However, the net result is the same.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nARMED ATTACK AND RESPONSE IN THE DIGITAL AGE\nstems in part from the fact that Article 2(4) and Article 51 do not entirely correspond in their wording. As has been noted above, Article 2(4) applies only in the international relations between states and thus does not apply to non-state actors; conversely, Article 51 refers to an inherent right of self-defence which is triggered ‘if an armed attack occurs’, with no mention of by whom the attack has been launched. Those arguing for a restricted right point to Article 51’s role as an exception to the prohibition contained in Article 2(4) to argue that it should likewise be constrained to armed attacks by states. Those, including the present author, who consider there is a broader right of self-defence point to state practice, the fact that Article 51 reflects an ‘inherent right’ rather than establishing one, and the recognition by the International Court of Justice in the Nicaragua (Merits) case that the Charter by no means reflects the whole of the body of law governing force.\nAs noted above, the International Court of Justice in its controversial decision in the Nicaragua (Merits) case, has addressed the issue of when a state might be held responsible for indirect military action by rebels acting ‘on behalf’ of a foreign state, establishing the test of ‘effective control’. For computer network attacks, where attribution is one of the major problems, this test will prove particularly difficult to satisfy and commentators have been quick to point out the advantages that such plausible deniability will offer to sending states. However, the question of whether a state has a right to respond with force to an armed attack by a non-state actor absent a degree of state complicity has proved a far more difficult question, and one on which the International Court of Justice has been reluctant to comment. The issue has been covered extensively in recent legal literature, and it is not proposed to conduct a full survey of the arguments here, other than to note that there appears to be a divergence between the limited jurisprudence of the Court and emerging state practice on the issue.\nIt is safe to say that the Court’s treatment of the matter has caused more confusion than clarification. In its advisory opinion on the Wall, in a statement described as both ‘opaque’ and ‘startling in its\n Moir, Resort to Force, 22.\n For the latter point see Nicaragua (Merits), para. 176.\n Although note also the alternate test established by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia in the Tadic case which specified an ‘effective control’ test.\n For a full discussion of the issues, see, for example, Gray, Use of Force (3rd edn); Moir, Resort to Force.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSELF-DEFENCE AGAINST NON-STATE ACTORS\n\nSurveys of state practice, on the other hand, tend to suggest a much greater willingness on the part of the international community to accept the possibility of self-defence against armed attacks by non-state actors without attribution to a state.97 Moir notes, however, that a certain level of support and involvement on the part of the state is required, and is consistently asserted by states claiming the right.98 Thomas Franck suggests that measures taken in self-defence against non-state actors will be accepted by the international community where victim states have identified correctly the place from where it was attacked, that the authorities in that place deliberately, knowingly\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nARMED ATTACK AND RESPONSE IN THE DIGITAL AGE\nor recklessly permitted the attack to occur, and that the victim state's response is proportionate. For computer network attacks each of these factors raise additional issues. First, as discussed in section 3 below, correctly identifying and attributing an attack to a particular perpetrator in a timely manner is one of the most difficult problems in the field of computer network attacks, both from a technical standpoint and a legal one. To be able to do so in a manner that is clear and verifiable by the international community so as to back a claim for the legitimate exercise of self-defence will be an added level of difficulty. Second, even once computer forensics have established the origins of the attacks, proving a sufficient level of support and involvement by a state will be difficult. For example, the computer network attacks against Georgia demonstrated a high level of coordination between the cyber attacks launched by ‘patriotic hackers’ and the military operations carried out by Russia. Russia has denied any involvement with the attacks, and no evidence has been found of state organisations guiding or directing the attacks ‘be it because there was none, because the collection efforts were not far-reaching or deep enough to identify those connections, or because involvement by state organisations was conducted in a way to purposefully avoid attribution’. There was certainly not enough to prove involvement of the Russian authorities in any official capacity, particularly absent the context of the military operations. In addition, states will find it very difficult to prevent or even be aware of computer network attacks emanating from their territory, particularly given the high prevalence of technologies such as proxy servers.\nThe final factor raised by Franck in determining whether the international community is likely to accept a claim by a state acting in self-defence against a non-state actor is the proportionality of the response. The question of proportionality is discussed in section 4 below; however, there are a few issues which pertain specifically to non-state actors. First, states have been quick to condemn actions\n Franck, Recourse to Force, 68.\n Project Grey Goose, Phase I Report, 3.\n Some investigators provided circumstantial evidence of possible involvement by individual officials within the Russian administration; however, many experts remain sceptical of these claims. See generally Tikk, Kaska and Vihul, Cyber Incidents, 74–6.\n It will be recalled that the computer network attacks began prior to the physical invasion and continued after the ceasefire.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nATTRIBUTION\npurportedly taken in self-defence which have targeted the infrastructure of the host state. Given that most computer network attacks by non-state actors utilise this infrastructure, it may prove difficult for victim states to find an acceptable target. Secondly, the dispersed nature of many computer network attacks means that the non-state actors responsible for the attack may be resident in several different host states, complicating the proportionality assessment of any forcible response. It should be noted, however, that the most obvious example of such a dispersed attack, the DDoS attack, would rarely rise to the level of gravity required for an armed attack, absent involvement in a wider programme of attacks that could be responded to under the doctrine of accumulation of events.\nOne final point deserves comment: computer network attacks may also provide a unique opportunity for states to take action against non-state actors without violating the territorial integrity of the state from which they are acting; however, non-state actors are less likely to have infrastructure that would provide viable targets for forcible computer network attacks.\n# 3. Attribution\nOne of the major problems with any computer network attack is the attribution of the attack to a particular actor. While the origin of some attacks becomes immediately evident, either because the attacker identifies themselves, or because they precede traditional attacks that are easily attributed to a particular source, other attacks will be launched anonymously. Given the common use of botnets and the frequency of IP spoofing that takes place in computer network attacks,\n See, for example, the international condemnation of the Israeli attacks against Lebanon in 2006 in response to attacks by Hezbollah, and also the comment of the ICJ in the Armed Activities case that the taking of airports and towns many kilometres away from the site of the series of transborder attacks complained of did not seem proportionate: Armed Activities Case, para. 147.\n See, for example, the opinion of Judge Higgins in the Wall case, dissenting on the grounds that non-forcible measures such as the construction of a wall do not really fall within the concept of self-defence.\n For example, the 'I Love You' virus source code contained the 'signature' of the author.\n For example, the Israeli attack on the Syrian air-defences in advance of an air strike.\n IP spoofing essentially forges the data identifying the sending computer in the header of a data packet so that it appears to originate from a different IP address, thus any response is sent to the forged computer.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nARMED ATTACK AND RESPONSE IN THE DIGITAL AGE\nit is difficult to state with any certainty that the entity that appears to be the perpetrator of the attack is in fact the ultimate attacker.\nIP spoofing can be used either to simply mask the origin of an attack, or in a deliberate attempt to place the blame for an attack on another party. An early example of the latter problem occurred in 1999 when a denial of service attack was launched against the US Department of Transport. The attack appeared to emanate from a server in Maryland run by followers of the Falun Gong movement; in fact, the attack was designed to take down both the Maryland server and the Department of Transport network server, leaving the Falun Gong bearing the blame. However, the attackers had blundered and the attack was traced to a computer located at the address of China's Ministry of Public Security. No information is publicly available regarding the US response to this attack; however, in 2002 Richard Clarke, then White House technology advisor, stated before a Senate Judiciary subcommittee hearing on cyber terrorism that the government had never been able to prove to their satisfaction that a particular government was responsible for a specific unauthorised intrusion.[108]\nThe proliferation of botnets also makes attribution difficult. As the 2007 denial of service attacks against Estonia proved, it can be very difficult to differentiate between attacks that originate from a particular address and those which are merely utilising a compromised computer. Although some of the IP addresses involved in the attacks against Estonia were traced to official IP addresses of Russian state authorities, Russia denied any involvement and claimed that these computers had been compromised and were being manipulated from outside the Kremlin. Subsequent reports by cyber security analysts tend to back this claim, pointing to the lack of evidence and also noting the possibility of spoofing the IP address of the attacker.[109]\nOf course, problems of attribution aren't restricted to cyberspace. Armed attacks following more conventional patterns are often carried out anonymously, or responsibility is claimed by armed groups which appear unlikely to have the resources required for such an attack. Further, in the case of state-sponsored terrorism, it is unlikely that any state will step forward to take responsibility for kinetic acts, let alone electronic ones. Those factors aside, a victim state must still establish\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nATTRIBUTION\na link between the attacking group and the sponsoring state, the same approach must be taken with electronic attacks. This may be particularly difficult to prove where attacks are launched by groups or loose affiliations of individuals in conjunction with traditional state action. For example, when Russia moved troops into South Ossetia following the Georgian offensive in 2008, the air strikes and ground forces were accompanied by a series of computer network attacks against Georgian servers. While these attacks were certainly not serious enough to amount to armed attacks, given Georgia's limited internet connectivity, they illustrate the capacity for other actors to effectively 'join-in' a conflict with or without state authorisation. Several security analysts reported botnets allegedly controlled by the Russian Business Network, a group known to be linked to cyber crime, launching denial of service attacks at Georgian servers. However, software was also freely available for download to individual computers from Russian language websites such as 'stopgeorgia.ru' along with a list of targets, making joining the cyber offensive as simple as a few mouse clicks. As noted previously, the Russian government denies any involvement with the attacks; however, the issue raises the difficult question of state responsibility for non-state actors and the necessity or degree of state involvement or complicity required before force can be used in self-defence against the state. This book does not address this issue in depth; suffice it to note that there is little agreement in the international community on the issue in relation to conventional attacks, let alone computer network attacks. However, it is clear that a state must not knowingly allow its territory to be used as a sanctuary for terrorists or armed bands bent on attacking military targets or civilian objects in another country.\nThe difficulty of attribution also affects the victim state's ability to engage in forcible countermeasures in self-defence. The Court in the\n Dinstein, 'CNA and Self-Defense', 112.\n John Markoff, 'Before the Gunfire, Cyberattacks', New York Times, 13 August 2008; Evgeny Morozov, 'An Army of Ones and Zeroes: How I Became a Soldier in the Georgia-Russia Cyberwar', Slate, 14 August 2008, www.slate.com/id/2197514/ (last accessed 12 April 2011).\n Siobhan Gorman, 'Georgia States Computers Hit by Cyberattack', Wall Street Journal (New York), 12 August 2008, A9.\n For a discussion of legal attribution and state responsibility for non-state actors' use of force see generally Gray, Use of Force (2nd edn).\n Ian Brownlie, 'International Law and the Activities of Armed Bands' (1958) 7 International and Comparative Law Quarterly 712, 734, cited in Dinstein, War, Aggression, and Self-Defense, 206.\n Sharp, Cyberspace and the Use of Force, 133, cited in Dinstein, 'CNA and Self-Defense', 111.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nARMED ATTACK AND RESPONSE IN THE DIGITAL AGE\nOil Platforms case held that the burden of proof rests on the state invoking the right of self-defence and that the United States had failed to prove that it had been subject to an armed attack by a particular state, vis Iran. ‘[A victim state] must not rush headlong into hasty action predicated on reflexive impulses and unfounded suspicions; it has no choice but to withhold forcible response until hard evidence is collated and the state of affairs is clarified, lest the innocent be endangered.’ Such hasty reactions could lead to the escalation of hostilities, something the ban on force was intended to prevent. However, the necessity of waiting for hard evidence of responsibility also opens the possibility that any action taken against a perpetrator once responsibility has been confirmed will be classified as an armed reprisal rather than an action taken in self-defence. Armed reprisals are prohibited under international law.\n## 4. Necessity and proportionality\nAll responses to attacks, whether their means of delivery are kinetic or electronic, are subject to the underlying principles of necessity and proportionality. The International Court of Justice has repeatedly confirmed that self-defence, whether individual or collective, warrants only those measures which are ‘proportional to the armed attack and necessary to respond to it’ as a principle well established in customary international law. The principles are not stated in UN Charter but are often traced back to the Webster formulation in the Caroline incident.\nThe principle of necessity requires that any measures taken avowedly in self-defence must have been necessary for that purpose; the principle is strict and objective ‘leaving no room for any measure of discretion’. That is, it is not sufficient that force is used after an armed attack; it must be necessary to repel that attack, and non-forcible remedies must either prove futile in limine or have in fact been exhausted in an\n Oil Platforms Case, paras 57, 61.\n Dinstein, ‘CNA and Self-Defense’, 111.\n Declaration on Friendly Relations, Principle on the Use of Force, para. 6.\n Nicaragua (Merits), paras 176 and 194; Nuclear Weapons Case, para. 41; Oil Platforms Case, para. 74; Armed Activities Case, para. 147.\n There must be ‘a necessity of defence, instant, overwhelming, leaving no choice of means and no moment for deliberation’.\n Oil Platforms Case, para. 73.\n Greenwood, ‘Pre-Emptive Use of Force’, 23.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nNECESSITY AND PROPORTIONALITY\n\nThe principle of necessity also gives rise to a related principle, namely that actions taken in self-defence must generally be taken without undue delay. In the case of computer network attacks, this may make successful claims of self-defence more difficult. Where the origins of a computer network attack are not obvious, the time taken to conduct computer forensics and establish hard evidence of the identity of the perpetrator may militate against a finding that any subsequent action by the victim state is in self-defence. Similar criticisms were levelled at the United States after a delay of several weeks between the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon and subsequent action in Afghanistan. Likewise, the Court in the *Nicaragua (Merits)* case also criticised the US for commencing activities purportedly in self-defence several months after the major offensive of the opposition against the government of El Salvador had been completely repulsed, although ultimately dismissing the claim of self-defence on other grounds. However, Dinstein notes that this requirement must not be construed too strictly; he points to the delay of approximately five months between the invasion of Kuwait and the authorisation of all necessary means by the Security Council.\nThe principle of proportionality requires the weighing of the response against its permitted purpose of halting and repelling the attack, or, in the case of anticipatory self-defence, preventing it from\n Dinstein, ‘CNA and Self-Defense’, 109.\n Roberto Ago, ‘Addendum to the Eighth Report on State Responsibility’ (1980) II UN Y.B.

Whether or not an act is proportionate will necessarily be dependent on the facts of the situation; however, the action must not be retaliatory or punitive, its lawfulness cannot be measured ‘except by its capacity for achieving the desired result’. This raises an interesting question with respect to computer network attacks; namely whether it would ever be proportionate to use traditional armed force against an electronic attack. The answer must surely be in the affirmative. Proportionality does not restrict the defending state to the same weapons or the same numbers of armed forces as the attacking state; nor is it necessarily limited to action on its own territory. Therefore it would be open to the victim of a computer network attack to use whatever weapons it has at its disposal to repel the attack, as long as the response is proportionate to that purpose. As Ago notes:\nIn the case of self-defence, it was essential to avoid the error of thinking that there should be some proportionality between the action of the aggressor and the action of the state defending itself. Proportionality could be judged only in terms of the objective of the action, which was to repel an attack and prevent it from succeeding. No limitations that might prejudice the success of a response to attack could be placed on the State suffering the attack. The concept of reasonable action must of course enter into the matter, since self-defence could not justify a genuine act of aggression committed in response to an armed attack of limited proportions.\nThus, if a computer network attack is being used to prepare the battlespace for a conventional attack, the use of military force in response must be proportionate in relation to the need to repel the attack as a whole. However, it should be noted that while physically bombing the attacking computers and their owners may be legal, it is not necessarily the preferred method of response. Only a few examples of state intrusion have been made public to date, and no large-scale attacks as would justify a forcible response have been reported. Further, state practice in response to electronic probes emanating from other states have not resulted in forcible responses.\n Ago, ‘Addendum’, 69 para. 121.\n Gray, *Use of Force* (3rd edn), 150.\n Roberto Ago, ‘State Responsibility’ (1980) Vol. 1 *UN Y.B.

Countermeasures against unlawful acts\nWhere a computer network attack does not rise to the level of an armed attack, a state may still respond with proportionate countermeasures. However, where forcible countermeasures are taken in response to an ordinary breach of international law, not constituting an armed attack, they are unlawful.\nHowever, an alternate line of reasoning, arising out of the controversial gap theory put forward by the majority of the International Court of Justice in the Nicaragua (Merits) decision, appears to have muddied the waters somewhat. The Court held that acts committed by Nicaragua against El Salvador, Honduras and Costa Rica amounted to less grave forms of ‘illegal military intervention’. The Court held that that ‘proportionate counter-measures’ were permissible on the part of the victim state; however, they did not create any entitlement by any third state to take collective countermeasures involving the use\nHezbollah telecommunications network. The response was condemned by states; however, given the non-international nature of the dispute, it does not provide any useful indication of state practice in this regard. See generally ‘Hezbollah Takes over West Beirut’, BBC News, 9 May 2008, http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/7391600.stm (last accessed 15 July 2011).\n Jensen, ‘Computer Attacks’, 231.\n Dinstein, War, Aggression, and Self-Defense, 226.\n The Court held that Nicaragua did supply aid to rebels in the territories of El Salvador, but had insufficient evidence of the nature, scale and continuance of such aid. The Court further held that Nicaragua was responsible for certain transborder military incursions into Honduras and Costa Rica.

The Court did not venture an opinion as to what form the individual countermeasures by the victim state might take, or whether they could include the use of force.\nJohn Hargrove has suggested that there are two possible interpretations of the Court’s statement. Either the Court was saying:\n(a) that there are some acts of force that nobody, not even the victim, may resist by proportionate measures of force; or it was saying (b) that the victim may resist with force provided that it does so alone. There is little to be said in explanation of the latter proposition other than it is simply a[n] ... arbitrary announcement of the Court.\nHargrove argues that allowing forcible countermeasures ‘would in one remarkable stroke manage both to impair the right of self-defense, and to weaken fundamentally the prohibition on the use of force by creating an open-ended and wholly new category of exceptions to Article 2(4) of the Charter, of unknown content and limit.’ However, Judge Simma in his separate opinion in the *Oil Platforms* case has argued that the Court in the *Nicaragua (Merits)* case cannot, in the context of that case, have understood that to mean mere pacific reprisals. He argues that the Court can only have meant ‘defensive military action “short of” full-scale self-defence’.\nBut we may encounter also a lower level of hostile military action, not reaching the threshold of an ‘armed attack’ within the meaning of Article 51 of the United Nations Charter. Against such hostile acts, a state may of course defend itself, but only within a more limited range and quality of responses (the main difference being that the possibility of collective self-defence does not arise, cf. *Nicaragua*) and bound to necessity, proportionality and immediacy in time in a particularly strict way.\nSimma’s treatment of the conditions in respect of forcible countermeasures is clearly linked to the classic self-defence analysis, rather\n ‘[A] use of force of a lesser degree of gravity cannot ... produce any entitlement to take collective counter-measures involving the use of force. The acts of which Nicaragua is accused ... could only have justified proportionate counter-measures on the part of the state which had been the victim of these acts, namely El Salvador, Honduras or Costa Rica. They could not justify counter-measures taken by a third state, the United States, and particularly could not justify intervention involving the use of force.’ *Ibid.*, para. 249.\n Hargrove, *Nicaragua Judgement*, 141.\n *Ibid.*, 142.\n *Oil Platforms Case* (per Judge Simma), para. 12.\n *Ibid.*, per Judge Simma, paras 12–13.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOUNTERMEASURES AGAINST UNLAWFUL ACTS\n\nWhere a computer network attack does not amount to an armed attack (or a use of force), any countermeasures taken by the victim state will be conditional on, and limited by, the law relating to countermeasures. In the Case Concerning the Gabcikovo-Nagymaros Project, the International Court of Justice set out a three-part test justifying proportionate countermeasures. First, the action must be taken in response to an internationally wrongful act of another state and be directed against that state. Second, the victim state must have called upon the offending state to discontinue its wrongful conduct or to make reparation for it. And finally, the effects of the countermeasure must be commensurate with the injury suffered, taking account of the rights in question. In this regard the test for proportionality differs between countermeasures and self-defence, where the response must be proportional to the threat, rather than the actual harm suffered. However, the Court also stated that the purpose of the countermeasures must be to induce the wrongdoing state to comply with its obligations under international law, and that the measure must therefore be reversible. In respect of a computer network attack this would seem to fit with current state practice; most attacks to date have merely resulted in states requesting the alleged perpetrator of the attack to cease their actions. However, the nature of computer network attacks, including the type of attacks they make possible and, most importantly, their ability to be reversed, makes computer network attacks particularly useful as a countermeasure against a previous wrongful act of a state. For example, a series\n See generally United Nations, International Law Commission and James Crawford, The International Law Commission's Articles on State Responsibility: Introduction, Text, and Commentaries (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, New York, 2002).\n Case Concerning the Gabcikovo-Nagymaros Project (1997) ICJ Reports 3, International Court of Justice, para. 85.\n Ibid., para. 87.\n Although it should be noted that in all reported cases to date the suspected perpetrator has denied any involvement with the attack.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nARMED ATTACK AND RESPONSE IN THE DIGITAL AGE\nof blackouts in response to an internationally wrongful act may be a useful coercive measure.\nThe 1998 Zapatista ‘Floodnet’ attacks on the Pentagon’s website by the Electronic Disturbance Theatre also provide a model for how electronic countermeasures might work against non-state actors. US Department of Defense specialists created a program that would recognise the Floodnet applet installed on computers trying to access the Department of Defense website. Once the applet was identified, a program was sent back to the activist’s computer to shut down their web browser, thus ending the attack. Although criticisms were levelled at the Department for not thoroughly considering the legal ramifications of such a response, the United States’ decision to respond electronically, in this instance, against an attack which they had been expecting, must be considered a proportionate countermeasure, particularly against a demonstrably non-violent protest group. There was some speculation that this approach was being renewed by the US Department of Defense in its ‘active defence’ policy released in 2011; statements made by Lynn prior to release of the policy indicated that the US intended to stop threats before they reached Department of Defense networks. However, the unclassified version of the Pentagon’s cyber-security strategy appears to focus the concept of active defence on network speed hunting for malicious activity within Department of Defense networks and systems, rather than pushing back beyond the network boundaries. The danger with adopting the push-back approach against states is the risk of escalation of such countermeasures into forcible responses, a situation which the Security Council would be likely to determine a threat to international peace and security, as seen in the following section.\n An applet is a small piece of code designed to perform one specific task within another application.\n Brian Friel, ‘DoD Launches Internet Counterattack’, Government Executive, 18 September 1998, http://govexec.com/dailyfed/0998/091898b1.htm (last accessed 12 April 2011).\n George I.

The Security Council has ‘primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security’ and may recommend or authorise member states to engage in measures, which may include the use of force, in order to pursue this aim. Article 39 provides:\nThe Security Council shall determine the existence of any threat to the peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression and shall make recommendations, or decide what measures shall be taken in accordance with Articles 41 and 42, to maintain or restore international peace and security.\nThis raises two separate issues for the use of computer network attacks. First, when will the Security Council consider computer network attacks to be a ‘threat to the peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression’; and second, under what circumstances might measures authorised by the Security Council under Chapter VII include computer network attacks?\nAs noted, prior to the Security Council recommending action, it must determine that a ‘threat to the peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression’ exists under Article 39. In practice, the Council has almost exclusively exercised its powers by finding a ‘threat to international peace and security’, even in situations where a breach of the peace or act of aggression is obvious; thus the analysis will concentrate on this broader standard. Whether or not there are any limits on the Security Council’s ability to determine a threat to the peace is the subject of debate amongst legal scholars; however, it is generally accepted that the Council possesses considerable discretion in this respect. The resulting range of situations in which the Security Council has found a threat to the peace is increasingly broad and includes the danger of violent countermeasures by states to violations of international law, regardless of their admissibility. The Council has also\n Jochen Frowein, ‘Article 39’ in B. Simma (ed.), The Charter of the United Nations: A Commentary (2nd edn, Oxford University Press, 2002) 717, 722; Gray, Use of Force (3rd edn), 256. All instances in which the Security Council has found an act of aggression or breach of the peace have involved inter-state conflicts.\n See generally Erika De Wet, The Chapter VII Powers of the United Nations Security Council (Hart, Oxford, 2004), 133-4.\n Frowein, ‘Article 39’, 722.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nARMED ATTACK AND RESPONSE IN THE DIGITAL AGE\nfound threats to the peace in internal conflicts such as those in Liberia, Rwanda, Sierra Leone and East Timor;[155] violations of human rights and humanitarian law in Somalia, Rwanda and Eastern Zaire;[156] violations of democratic principles in Haiti and Sierra Leone;[157] terrorism;[158] nuclear proliferation and even failure to cooperate with international prosecutions.[159] These examples illustrate the broad discretion that the Security Council has to determine that a threat to the peace exists; however, Frowein has argued that this does not mean that the notion of a threat to the peace has become limitless. He argues that a threat to the peace exists when, in a particular situation, a danger of the use of force on a considerable scale arises.[160] Although the Security Council has not considered any computer network attacks to date,[161] based on this assessment it would certainly appear that a computer network attack would constitute a threat to the peace where it is of sufficient gravity that a state is likely to respond to it with force, regardless of whether it is categorised as an armed attack, or where the type of attack indicates further violence to follow, whether electronically or by kinetic means.\nOnce the Security Council has determined a threat to the peace, the Council may make recommendations, or require states to take action under Articles 40, 41 and 42 of the Charter, for the restoration or maintenance of international peace and security. Interestingly, once the Security Council has deemed a situation a threat to the peace, it 'is free to take measures against any entity which it considers to be an obstructive factor in the restoration of peace'.[162] Thus, having determined the\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSECURITY COUNCIL AUTHORISATION AND COLLECTIVE MEASURES\n\nArticle 40 allows the Security Council to establish any provisional measures it deems necessary or desirable to prevent an aggravation of the situation, before deciding what recommendations to make under Article 39. Provisional measures are made without prejudice to the rights, claims or position of the parties, but failure to comply with them will be taken into account by the Security Council.\nArticle 41 allows the Security Council to decide:\n[W]hat measures not involving the use of armed force are to be employed to give effect to its decisions, and it may call upon the Members of the United Nations to apply such measures. These may include complete or partial interruption of economic relations and of rail, sea, air, postal, telegraphic, radio, and other means of communication, and the severance of diplomatic relations. (emphasis added)\nThis would also allow for the disruption of individual internet access, such as that demonstrated by the United States in response to the 1998 attack by the Electronic Disturbance Theatre, and may also allow for the total disconnection of a country from the internet by a third party, in the same manner as the self-imposed internet blackouts attempted internally by regimes in Egypt, Myanmar and Libya. Some attempts have been made to argue that such a measure would be the electronic equivalent of a blockade (which would fall within the forceful measures provided for in Article 42); however, the present author does not consider that this is an appropriate classification, despite the\n SC Res 1127, 1997, cited in ibid.\n James Cowie, ‘What Libya Learned from Egypt’, *Renesys Blog*, 5 March 2011, www.renesys.com/blog/2011/03/what-libya-learned-from-egypt.shtml (last accessed 12 April 2011); Jordan Robertson, ‘The Day Part of the Internet Died: Egypt Goes Dark’, *The Washington Times* 28 January 2011, www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/jan/28/day-part-internet-died-egypt-goes-dark/ (last accessed 12 April 2011); OpenNet Initiative, *Pulling the Plug: A Technical Review of the Internet Shutdown in Burma*, OpenNet Initiative (2007), http://opennet.net/sites/opennet.net/files/ONI_Bulletin_Burma_2007.pdf (last accessed 12 April 2011).\n See media reports following both the Estonian and Georgian denial of service attacks.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nARMED ATTACK AND RESPONSE IN THE DIGITAL AGE\nsevere economic effects that this would undoubtedly have on highly technologically dependent states. Electronic measures under Article 41 could arguably also encompass denial of service attacks launched against the media, banking and telecommunications infrastructure of a state, although the shaping of the response to the threat may prove difficult in practice.\nWhere non-forceful measures have been unsuccessful, or if the Security Council determines that such measures would be inadequate, the Council may authorise action under Article 42 by such air, sea or land forces as may be necessary to maintain or restore international peace and security; examples include demonstrations, blockade and other operations by air, sea or land forces of Members of the United Nations. It appears unlikely that the Security Council would consider it necessary to authorise force against a computer network attack; however, where an attack or ongoing series of attacks cannot be prevented or stopped by electronic means, it is within their purview to do so. As noted earlier, force is not necessarily the preferred means of countering a cyber attack because of the distributed nature of many methods of attack.\nA more interesting scenario is the possibility of the Security Council authorising computer network attacks of sufficient gravity to amount to a use of force in response to a threat to the peace. For example, in the past few years the Security Council has passed a series of resolutions expressing its concern over the proliferation risks presented by the Iranian nuclear programme. Although the Council has not explicitly stated that it considers that the programme represents a threat to international peace and security, this is far from unusual; it is clear from the practice of the Council that no formal pronouncement with an express reference to Article 39 is necessary; the use of the language is apparently sufficient. The Council does, however, explicitly state that it is acting under Article 41 of Chapter VII of the Charter, and each resolution calls for member states to implement a series of specific non-forceful measures against Iran. The author has previously concluded that the Stuxnet worm amounts to a use of force as it is\n For example, the OECD estimates the economic impact of shutting down internet and mobile phone services in Egypt for five days in 2011 at US$90 million in direct costs alone.\n Art. 42, UN Charter.\n SC Res 1929 (2010); SC Res 1803 (2008); SC Res 1747 (2007); SC Res 1737 (2006).\n Gray, Use of Force (3rd edn), 256.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCONCLUSION\n\n## 7. Conclusion\nAs with the discussion in the previous chapter relating to the use of force, the classification of computer network attacks as armed attacks sits on top of a deep doctrinal divide between those who would argue for a wide interpretation of the right to self-defence and those who would restrict it. The present author believes that in regard to computer network attacks, a restrictive view of the armed attack threshold and the subsequent right to self-defence is preferable. Classification of computer network attacks which would amount to armed attacks should therefore be restricted to those attacks which cause physical damage to property or persons of a sufficient scale and effect. Given the particular difficulties and length of time involved in accurately attributing attacks and the fact that states acting in self-defence are not restricted to responding in kind, the danger of computer network attacks escalating into traditional conflict is apparent. That is not to say that states cannot respond to computer network attacks that do not rise to the level of an armed attack; a state may still respond with proportionate countermeasures or appeal to the Security Council for a finding that the attacks amount to a threat to the peace.\n Thus even if Stuxnet had not resulted in physical damage but merely stopped the enrichment facility from working it could not have fallen within the terms of the Security Council authorisations.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press"

The UN Charter system admits only two exceptions to the prohibition on the use of force: collective measures authorised by the Security Council acting under Chapter VII of the Charter; or the inherent right of collective or individual self-defence provided for in Article 51.\nThe exact scope of the right of self-defence remains one of the divisive issues in international law, so it is not surprising that its application to the topic of computer network attacks is particularly complex. First, it is difficult to identify the point at which a computer network attack will rise to the level of an 'armed attack', the threshold that triggers a state's right to self-defence. As seen in the previous chapter, traditional international law focuses on personal injury, fatality and damage to physical property as measures of the seriousness of an attack. This approach is favoured by most commentators writing on the subject to date;¹ however, many catastrophically damaging computer network attacks will not cause any of these deleterious consequences. Further, it is likely that many attacks using computer network operations will not come as a single instance, but rather as a series of events which, taken separately, may not be sufficient to qualify as an armed attack. This raises the issue of the right to respond to 'pin-prick' attacks with a single use of force, a concept which has had a chequered history in international law. The likelihood that computer network attacks will\n¹ See Horace B. Robertson, 'Self-Defense against Computer Network Attack under International Law' in M. N. Schmitt and B. T. O'Donnell (eds.), Computer Network Attack and International Law (Naval War College, Newport, RI, 2002) 122–45, 136, for examples of authors adopting the consequence-based approach.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nARMED ATTACK AND RESPONSE IN THE DIGITAL AGE\nbe used in conjunction with, or as a precursor to, a conventional attack may also raise a right to respond to such attacks under the auspices of the controversial doctrine of anticipatory self-defence. For example, will intrusion into an air defence network be sufficient evidence of an imminent attack following the 2007 Israeli raid on the alleged Syrian nuclear site.\nThe second major difficulty with computer network attacks, as opposed to traditional kinetic attacks, is the difficulty of attributing an attack to its original perpetrator. The length of time required to trace an attack makes questions of the necessity of force to repel a computer network attack difficult to satisfy. Questions of proportionality also arise in determining whether it would ever be proportionate to use armed force in response to a computer network attack. This chapter examines these questions in light of current international law, the definition of armed attack and considers in what circumstances force may be used in self-defence against a computer network attack.\nThe final sections address the authorisation to use force under the auspices of Chapter VII Security Council resolutions, and what measures might be taken by states in response to computer network attacks which fail to meet the threshold for lawful self-defence.\n# 1. Armed attack\nThe right of self-defence is a customary law right, inherent in the sovereignty of states; it has been codified for the most part by Article 51 of the UN Charter as follows:\nNothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security. Measures taken by Members in the exercise of this right of self-defence shall be immediately reported to the Security Council and shall not in any way affect the authority and responsibility of the Security Council under the present Charter to take at any time such action as it deems necessary in order to maintain or restore international peace and security.\nThe customary status of the right has been confirmed by the Nicaragua (Merits) case.² Article 51 of the Charter allows self-defence in response to an 'armed attack' and the International Court of Justice has\n² Nicaragua (Merits), para. 176.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nARMED ATTACK\nconfirmed in both the Nicaragua (Merits) and Oil Platforms decisions that nothing short of an armed attack (with the possible exception of an anticipated armed attack) will be sufficient to trigger the right of self-defence under international law.³ The Oil Platforms case also established that it is for the state using force in self-defence to prove that it has been subjected to an armed attack.⁴ However, as with the term ‘force’, the Charter does not provide a definition of ‘armed attack’. Further, the historical predecessors to the Charter system do not offer any interpretive assistance. Neither the Kellogg-Briand Pact nor the Covenant of the League of Nations refer to the term. Both formulate self-defence as a response to aggression; hence all attempts at definition were focused on that term.⁵ The drafting history of the Charter provides evidence that discussions took place on the difference between an attack and an armed attack (based on the fact that the United States draft of 11 May 1945 contained both terms) and although no definitive conclusion was reached, the term was replaced by armed attack only.⁶ Professor Ian Brownlie has pointed out that it is likely that the records of the San Francisco conference contain no definition of the phrase ‘armed attack’ because the term was considered ‘sufficiently clear’ and ‘self-evident’.⁷ That was certainly the case in the drafting of the North Atlantic Treaty around the same time, as evidenced by the comments of the Foreign Relations Committee of the United States Senate which noted that the phrase ‘armed attack’ in Article 5 ‘is ordinarily self evident’ and ‘there is rarely, if ever, any doubt as to whether it has occurred or by whom it was launched’.⁸ The decision of the International Court of Justice in the Nicaragua (Merits) case made clear that armed attacks form a subset of the term ‘force’ in Article 2(4); therefore those actions which have been discussed in the previous chapter as falling outside the ambit of the definition of armed force will subsequently also fail to meet the threshold of an armed attack. However, not every use of force will be an armed attack,\n³ Ibid.; Case Concerning Oil Platforms (Islamic Republic of Iran v.

The Court sees no reason to deny that, in customary law, the prohibition of armed attacks may apply to the sending by a State of armed bands to the territory of another State, if such an operation, because of its scale and effects, would have been classified as an armed attack rather than as a mere frontier incident had it been carried out by regular armed forces.\nThe Court goes on to consider that acts such as ‘assistance to rebels in the form of the provision of weapons or logistical or other support’ do not constitute an armed attack, but might nonetheless constitute a threat or use of force, or amount to intervention in the internal or external affairs of other states.¹¹ Despite being the subject of much criticism and discussion, the Court’s decision makes clear that under current international law the definition of ‘armed attack’ is dependent on the ‘scale and effects’ of an attack which must be of sufficient gravity to elevate such actions beyond ‘mere frontier incidents’.¹² The view that an armed attack must be of ‘relatively large scale and with substantial effect’ is reiterated by several leading scholars,¹³ and is in\n⁹ Nicaragua (Merits), para. 195. ¹⁰ Ibid.\n¹¹ Ibid., para. 195, 231. This position was strongly criticised by Judges Schwebel and Jennings in their dissenting opinions, Schwebel holding that the term substantial involvement in the Definition of Aggression meant that an armed attack could include financial and logistical support.\n¹² Ibid., para. 195.\n¹³ See, for example, Randelzhofer, ‘Article 51’, 796 (with accompanying citations). See also Dinstein, ‘CNA and Self-Defense’, 100, noting that the use of force must be of sufficient gravity before armed attack is in progress, no matter that it be of small magnitude.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nARMED ATTACK\nagreement with the de minimis rule for small-scale attacks set out in Article 2 of the Definition of Aggression adopted by the UN General Assembly, an example also given by the Court in the Nicaragua (Merits) case.^\nThe Court's distinction between 'the most grave forms of the use of force (those constituting an armed attack)' and 'other less grave forms',^ and the resultant gap between force and armed attack, results in the peculiar situation where an illegal use of force not tantamount to an armed attack may be launched by one state against another, leaving the victim state unable to respond in self-defence. Logically and pragmatically the gap has to be quite narrow, inasmuch as 'there is very little effective protection against states violating the prohibition on the use of force, as long as they do not resort to an armed attack'.^ Michael Schmitt has commented that this distinction makes sense in light of the Charter's central purpose to 'maintain international peace and security' as it creates a rebuttable presumption against the resort by states to violence.^ Thus he notes 'it is logical to interpret the prohibition on the use of force expansively, but characterize exceptions that lie outside the community decisional architecture, such as self-defense, narrowly'.^\nOther commentators, including Judge Simma in a separate opinion in the Oil Platforms case, have argued, however, that it makes no logical sense to prohibit a state from forcibly defending itself or permitting its allies to come to the state's defence where it is the subject of an unlawful use of force.^ Any fears of an unwarranted escalation of an incident can be dealt with under the existing rules pertaining to proportionality.^ Despite such debate, following the Nicaragua (Merits) and\n^ The Security Council may determine whether actions falling under the examples given in Article 3 do not constitute 'acts of aggression' owing to their lack of gravity.

However, the thresholds of each of these concepts, and the responses which each allows, are yet to be established with any certainty.\nThis uncertainty makes the classification of any computer network attack particularly difficult. As noted previously, the possible effects of computer network attacks 'span the spectrum of consequentiality', thus making classification based on the type of computer network attack impossible; each attack must be assessed on its merits. It seems certain, however, that where a computer network attack causes destruction and fatalities on a par with a conventional attack, a state will have a right to respond in self-defence. This is the conclusion reached in a report by the Office of General Counsel of the US Department of Defense, which concluded:\n[I]f a coordinated computer network attack shuts down a nation's air traffic control system along with its banking and financial systems and public utilities, and opens the floodgates of several dams resulting in general flooding that causes widespread civilian deaths and property damage, it may well be that no-one would challenge a victim nation if it concluded that it was the victim of an armed attack, or of an act equivalent to an armed attack.\nWhile undoubtedly correct, the report fails to separate and analyse the attack in its component parts, combining those components which directly cause death and destruction with less severe attacks. Schmitt focuses on the consequences of the attack rather than on the object of the attack or on the intentions of the attacker; the exception being where the intentions of the attacker are specifically to cause physical damage to tangible objects or injury to human beings, in which case Schmitt considers the resort to armed force is permitted. He argues that self-defence should be limited to operations which are de facto armed attacks, or imminently preparatory thereto; the net result being a limitation on both sides to resort to computer network attack techniques which might threaten global stability and on individual responses which might themselves prove destabilising.\n21 Schmitt, 'Normative Framework', 912.\n22 Office of General Counsel, An Assessment on International Legal Issues in Information Operations, United States Department of Defense (1999) www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/dod-io-legal/dod-io-legal.pdf (last accessed 5 July 2011).\n23 Schmitt, 'Normative Framework', 928.\n24 Ibid., 886. This is in accord with his generally contextualist analysis discussed in Chapter 2.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nARMED ATTACK\nIn contrast, Walter Sharp, one of the early authors on the subject, argues that any intrusion into systems containing information which is critical to the national security of the victim state should be considered an armed attack capable of triggering the right to respond with force.²⁵ This idea is premised on the notion that the features of modern society and its reliance on information systems are such that non-military means can often cause more harm than military ones.²⁶ However Sharp’s ‘strict liability’ approach has not been borne out by state practice, which to date has recognised such intrusions as simple espionage, an act not prohibited under international law.\nThe present author considers that the threshold for an armed attack conducted by computer network attack must be set in line with current international law regulating the right of self-defence. A state is therefore permitted to respond in self-defence when it is the victim of a computer network attack causing damage to property or persons of sufficient scale and effect to elevate it beyond the equivalent of a frontier incident. The denial of service attacks against Estonia in 2007, disruptive as they were, did not reach this level; neither did the attacks launched the following year against Georgia, although the analysis of that incident is complicated by the subsequent conventional attacks by Russia.²⁷ No loss of life, physical injury or destruction of property was suffered as a result of the computer network operations launched against either state. In contrast, the 2010 Stuxnet worm has purportedly resulted in significant destruction of property. At the time of writing, reports indicate that the worm may be responsible for Iran having to replace 1,000 of the 9,000 IR-1 centrifuges at the Natanz nuclear fuel enrichment facility. While reports of the effect of the worm on the facility and the resulting impact on Iran’s nuclear programme have differed wildly, a report by the Institute for Science and International Security detailing the effect of Stuxnet has concluded that while the effects of the worm were significant, the effect on Iran’s nuclear programme was only moderate:²⁸\n²⁵ Sharp, Cyberspace and the Use of Force, 129.\n²⁶ Ibid., 101–2.\n²⁷ The question of the cyber attacks acting as an indication of imminent armed attacks is addressed in the following section on anticipatory self-defence.\n²⁸ David Albright, Paul Brannan and Christina Walrond, Stuxnet Malware and Natanz: Update of ISIS December 22, 2010 Report, Institute for Science and International Security (2011) 3.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nARMED ATTACK AND RESPONSE IN THE DIGITAL AGE\nWhile it has delayed the Iranian Centrifuge program at the Natanz plant in 2010 and contributed to slowing its expansion, it did not stop it or even delay the continued build up of [low enriched uranium]\nThat being the case, it would appear that while the Stuxnet worm would undoubtedly amount to a use of force, the scale and effects of the attack do not appear to have sufficient gravity to amount to an armed attack.\n## 1.1. Anticipatory self-defence\nIt is likely that computer network attacks will be used in conjunction with, or as a prelude to, a traditional armed attack. Such attacks designed to 'prepare the battle space' can come in a myriad of forms, including the disablement of intelligence-gathering sensors such as satellites and radar posts via computer network attack, disruption of military communications networks leaving units isolated and unable to be scrambled, or, on the civilian level, disablement of emergency response networks may be launched in anticipation of more traditional kinetic action to follow. It is certainly clear that states are considering how a combination of electronic and traditional attacks might be used in the future. For example, the US actively looked for computer network solutions prior to the 2003 invasion of Iraq and China is openly looking for an 'assassin's mace' to address the perceived asymmetry of the Chinese military against the US in conventional conflicts, widely believed to incorporate computer network attacks.²⁹ As Robertson points out, in modern warfare the electronic battlefield will play a crucial role, and any steps that a prospective attacker can take to neutralise or destroy its enemy's command and control, intelligence, communications, or weapons-control networks prior to a traditional attack would gain an enormous advantage.³⁰ This advantage was seen in the 2007 Israeli attack on the suspected Syrian nuclear site where the air defence radar did not detect the attacking planes until they were disappearing back over the border.³¹ One might also look to the role of the distributed denial of service attacks against Georgia in 2008 which preceded the physical invasion by Russia. While such attacks may not be sufficient\n²⁹ David A. Fulghum, ‘Frustrations and Backlogs’, *Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology* 10, 10 March 2003, 33. According to reports these attempts were never put into action due to the interconnectedness of the target systems with foreign-owned networks.\n³⁰ Robertson, ‘Self-Defense against CNA’, 139.\n³¹ See Fulghum, Wall and Butler, ‘Israel Shows Electronic Prowess’.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nARMED ATTACK\nto amount to an armed attack in and of themselves, as preparatory moves in a conventional attack they may be sufficient to justify the use of force under the doctrine of anticipatory self-defence.\n## 1.1.1. Doctrinal debate and imminent attacks\nThere is no consensus in international legal doctrine over the point in time from which measures of self-defence against an armed attack may be taken.³² In particular, states and commentators are divided over whether a right of anticipatory self-defence exists in international law. The debate centres on whether anticipatory self-defence survived the implementation of Article 51 of the UN Charter, which states that nothing in the Charter ‘shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs’. Those arguing for a restrictive interpretation of the clause interpret this to mean that the right of self-defence is now only available to member states who are the object of an actual armed attack. Gray, Kelsen and Brownlie are some of the leading proponents of this view, which is based on the premise that the Charter forbids any use of force on the part of individual members except for the right of self-defence against an armed attack.³³\nThose arguing for a more expansive approach point out that Article 51 specifically reserves the ‘inherent right’ of self-defence, and the customary right includes the right to respond to an imminent armed attack.³⁴ Although ultimately disagreeing with the position, Bothe points out that many authors acknowledge that a threat may be so direct and overwhelming that it is just not feasible to require the victim to wait to act in self-defence until the act has actually started.³⁵ Other authors have addressed this problem by adopting a broader notion\n³² Randelzhofer, ‘Article 51’, 803.\n³³ Bowett, *Self-Defence*, 188. See also Brownlie, *Use of Force by States*, 275; Ian Brownlie, *International Law and the Use of Force by States: Revisited* (Europaeum, Oxford, 2001); Randelzhofer, ‘Article 51’, 803–4; Christine D. Gray, *International Law and the Use of Force* (3rd edn, Oxford University Press, 2008), 160; Dinstein, *War, Aggression, and Self-Defense*, 183.\n³⁴ Authors subscribing to this expansive view include Thomas M. Franck, *Recourse to Force: State Action against Threats and Armed Attacks* (Cambridge University Press, 2002), 97; Bowett, *Self-Defence*, 187–92; Christopher Greenwood, ‘International Law and the Pre-Emptive Use of Force: Afganistan, Al-Qaida, and Iraq’ (2003) 4 San Diego Int’l L.J. 7; Robert Y. Jennings and C. Arthur H. Watts (eds.), *Oppenheim’s International Law* (9th edn, Longman, Harlow, 1992), 421.\n³⁵ Michael Bothe, ‘Terrorism and the Legality of Pre-Emptive Force’ (2003) 14(2) EJIL 227, 231.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nARMED ATTACK AND RESPONSE IN THE DIGITAL AGE\nof when an armed attack has occurred in the context of Article 51. For example, while expressly rejecting the notion of anticipatory self-defence, Yoram Dinstein nevertheless incorporates actions taken in advance of an actual attack by moving the timing of the beginning of the attack, a concept he calls ‘interceptive’ self-defence.³⁶ Dinstein argues that the beginning of an armed attack is not linked to the first shot but rather to the moment of irrevocable commitment to the attack. Once the die has been cast, the armed attack can be said to have commenced and the victim state need not ‘wait impotently for the inescapable blow’.³⁷ This concept has echoes in the ‘target locking’ arguments of some states in respect of modern precision-guided missiles. For example, the US argues that an armed attack begins when the radar guiding the missile is locked on and ready to fire, and the rules of engagement of their armed forces reflect this approach.³⁸ Although, as Lindsay Moir points out, whether such an approach truly distinguishes between an armed attack which has begun but not yet reached the target state, and an armed attack that has not begun but is imminent, is open to question.³⁹\nThe standard to be applied for taking action in anticipation of an attack was set out by US Secretary of State Daniel Webster in his letter regarding the Caroline incident of 1837. In his now classic formulation, he stated that the right of self-defence only arises where there is ‘a necessity of self-defence, instant, overwhelming, leaving no choice of means, and no moment for deliberation’.⁴⁰ Christopher Greenwood\n³⁶ Dinstein, War, Aggression, and Self-Defense, 187.\n³⁷ Dinstein, ‘CNA and Self-Defense’, 111.\n³⁸ Gray, Use of Force (2nd edn), 108, n. 48. For example, in 1998 US aircraft in the no-fly zone over Iraq fired at a missile battery when its radar had locked on to the planes patrolling the zone. Although there was controversy over whether the radar had locked on, the idea that the armed attack had started when the radar locked on was apparently accepted by Iraq and other states: Keesings (1998) 42368.\n³⁹ Lindsay Moir, Reappraising the Resort to Force: International Law, Jus Ad Bellum and the War on Terror (Hart, Oxford, 2010), 16.\n⁴⁰ In that incident, UK forces captured, fired and sent over the Niagara Falls a merchant vessel called the Caroline which was being used by Canadian rebels and their American forces in attacks against passing British ships. At the time of the UK attack the ship was moored in an American port and two US nationals were killed. One of the British officers, Lieutenant McLeod, was later arrested in the United States on charges of murder arising out of the incident. The British government, seeking McLeod’s release, maintained that its forces had acted in self-defence, to which US Secretary of State Daniel Webster replied in what has become the accepted statement of self-defence doctrine at the time. The Caroline Case (1837) 29 BFSP 1137-8.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nARMED ATTACK\npoints out that the Caroline test was applied by the international military tribunals at Nuremburg and Tokyo, suggesting that the right to respond in self-defence against imminent attacks was part of the customary law right preserved by Article 51 of the Charter.⁴¹ The preservation of an inherent right of self-defence and the existence of customary rights outside the Charter wording is also recognised by the Court in the Nicaragua (Merits) case, which noted that the Charter does not contain all the rules pertaining to self-defence, notably a definition of armed attack and the requirement of necessity and proportionality in any response.⁴² The Court expressly did not comment on the lawfulness of an anticipatory response to an imminent armed attack as it was not required on the facts of the case.⁴³ The Court’s approach in avoiding the difficult questions of self-defence and expressly stating no view on anticipatory self-defence has been followed in both the Wall and Armed Activities cases.⁴⁴ Two recent UN reports have not been so reluctant, however. The 2004 report of the UN Secretary-General’s High Level Panel concluded that there was an existing right of anticipatory self-defence against imminent attacks, basing their conclusion on customary international law.⁴⁵ Likewise the Report of the Secretary-General the following year expresses the view that responses to imminent threats are fully covered by Article 51 of the Charter.⁴⁶\n## 1.1.2. State practice\nThe content of any customary right of anticipatory self-defence must be examined in light of state practice since the inception of the Charter. While state practice is far from conclusive on the matter, two instances in particular tend to indicate that the doctrine has survived. The first is the Israeli-Arab war of 1967. In the wake of escalating tensions between Syria and Israel, Egypt requested the removal of a United Nations emergency force from Egyptian territory, reinforced troops in the Sinai and dispatched troops to Jordan. Egyptian President Nasser also closed the Straits of Tiran to Israeli shipping (an act that Israel had\n⁴¹ Greenwood, ‘Pre-Emptive Use of Force’, 13.\n⁴² Nicaragua (Merits), para. 176.\n⁴³ Ibid., para. 194.\n⁴⁴ The Wall Case; Armed Activities Case, para. 143.\n⁴⁵ United Nations, A More Secure World: Our Shared Responsibility.

In response to these actions Israel launched strikes against Egypt's airbases, completely destroying the Egyptian air force.⁴⁷ Israel justified its actions in the Security Council by claiming that it had been attacked first, but also by reference to a series of acts of sabotage from Syria, and stressed both the character of the Egyptian blockade as an act of war and ‘perhaps more imminent than anything else, this vast and purposeful encirclement movement’ caused by the transfer of large numbers of Egyptian forces to their ‘very gates’.⁴⁸ Gray rejects this incident as evidence of an acceptance of anticipatory self-defence, stating that ‘whatever position is taken on the facts of the outbreak of the Six Day War, the point of importance here is that Israel did not claim to be acting in anticipatory self-defence’.⁴⁹ However, Franck notes that Israel’s ‘words and actions clearly asserted a right of anticipatory self-defence against an imminent armed attack’.⁵⁰ In emphasising the fact that neither the Security Council nor the General Assembly condemned Israel’s actions, Franck comments:⁵¹\nMost states, on the basis of the evidence available to them, did however conclude that such an armed attack was imminent, that Israel had reasonably surmised that it stood a better chance of survival if the attack were pre-empted, and that, therefore, in the circumstances, it had not acted unreasonably. This does not amount to an open-ended endorsement of a general right to anticipatory self-defense, but it does recognize that, in demonstrable circumstances of extreme necessity, anticipatory self-defense may be a legitimate exercise of a State’s right to ensure its survival.\nThis accords with the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice in the Nuclear Weapons case, which indirectly commented on the situation when the majority of judges were unable to conclude that the first use of nuclear weapons would invariably be unlawful if the very existence of the state were threatened.⁵²\n⁴⁷ For a full exposition of the facts of this incident see generally A.

In most cases the reaction was based on a conclusion that Israel had failed to demonstrate that there was an imminent threat from Iraq and had thus failed to satisfy the Caroline requirements for anticipatory self-defence rather than a general dismissal of a right of anticipatory self-defence.54 As Greenwood points out, the emphasis on this failure to demonstrate the existence of the imminent threat tends, if anything, to confirm the existence of a right of self-defence in cases where such an imminent threat was shown to exist.55 He goes on to cite Rosalyn Higgins, who notes:56\n[I]n a nuclear age, common sense cannot require one to interpret an ambiguous provision in a text in a way that requires a state passively to accept its fate before it can defend itself. And, even in the face of conventional warfare, this would also seem the only realistic interpretation of the contemporary right of self-defence. It is the potentially devastating consequences of prohibiting self-defence unless an armed attack has already occurred that leads one to prefer this interpretation – although it has to be said that, as a matter of simple construction of the words alone, another conclusion might be reached.\nIn assessing what will constitute an imminent attack, Greenwood argues that there are two additional factors which must be taken into account which did not exist at the time of the Caroline incident:57\nThe first is the gravity of the threat. The threat posed by a nuclear weapon, or a biological or chemical weapon, if used against a city, is so horrific that it is in a different league from the threats posed (as in the Caroline) by cross-border raids conducted by men armed only with rifles. Where the threat is an attack by weapons of mass destruction, the risk imposed upon a State by waiting until that attack actually takes place compounded by the impossibility for that State to afford its population any effective protection once the attack has been launched, mean that such an attack can reasonably be treated as imminent in circumstances where an attack by conventional means would not be so regarded. The second consideration is the method of delivery of the threat. It is far more difficult to determine the time scale within which a threat of\n53 SC Res 487, UN SCOR, 2288th Meeting, 19 June 1981, UN Doc.

These would be material considerations in assessing whether, in any particular case, an attack should be treated as imminent.\nAlthough the existence of a right of anticipatory self-defence remains controversial, it is the view of the present author that a right of self-defence against an imminent attack is established in customary international law. The idea of computer network attacks as an indicator of an imminent attack is discussed in the following section.\n### 1.1.3. Computer network attacks and anticipatory self-defence\nThere are two situations where anticipatory self-defence may be implicated in the information warfare context: first, where a computer network attack serves as an imminent threat of a conventional attack; and secondly, where electronic activity indicates a severe computer network attack (which rises to the level of an armed attack) is imminent.\nAs with any assessment of an imminent attack the context of a computer network attack must be taken into account. Where a computer network attack is launched as a precursor to conventional attack, the target will be important. If an attack targets early warning systems, radar posts or satellite feeds, military communications, or emergency response systems it is likely that a state will judge a traditional attack to be imminent. The Israeli attack against the Syrian air-defence network is a case in point. Had Syria become aware of the intrusion and manipulation of its air-defence radar prior to the attack, they would have been entitled to use force in response. Indeed most military forces would claim that the neutralisation of the air-defence network was the beginning of the attack itself, and would certainly be included under Dinstein’s interceptive self-defence analysis.\nThe disruption of electrical power grids or financial systems, on the other hand, is unlikely to be sufficiently indicative of a subsequent conventional attack when viewed in isolation. Thus when Estonia was subject to distributed denial of service attacks against its banking, media and governmental sites, there were no realistic fears that this signalled the beginning of a traditional armed attack. The additional variables, such as positive attribution to a particular actor and possible motivation, are too many and too varied. However, when such attacks are viewed in conjunction with other contextual indicators, states may be more likely to conclude that a conventional attack is imminent.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nARMED ATTACK\nThe 2008 conflict between Russia and Georgia over South Ossetia illustrates the dangers associated with such an attribution, however. That conflict took place in an atmosphere of increased tensions between the states and in the face of skirmishes between separatist forces and the Georgian military. Prior to the physical invasion, a series of distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks were launched against the Georgian government, and media targets and commentators have noted the close coordination between the targets of the computer network attacks in specific areas and the later physical strikes.58 While it is tempting to conclude that the computer network attacks were indicative of the imminent physical invasion, analysts agree that there is no link evident between the Russian government and the attacks, and that patriotic hackers were behind the electronic disruptions.59 Given the increasing frequency with which hacktivist groups launch such denial of service attacks to further their causes or protest political decisions, it seems unlikely that states will be able to rely on such attacks as indicators even, and perhaps especially, in times of increased political tension.\nThe second instance where a computer network attack may be evidence of an imminent armed attack is the use of computer network intrusions to prepare an electronic battlespace. Viruses, worms, Trojan horses and other forms of malware routinely infect unprotected computers with malicious code which may corrupt data, cause a malfunction, record keystrokes, disable virus protection and collect other information such as passwords and other access codes, feeding them back to a remote attacker. One of the most common features of these types of malware is some form of backdoor payload which allows the attacker to access and control the computer at a later date. Such malware is most often used to 'recruit' unprotected computers to vast networks of compromised computers called botnets. Usually used for spam or criminal enterprise, the controllers of the botnet can also use the command and control servers of the botnet to direct the sending of large amounts of traffic to particular IP addresses, bringing them, and\n58 See, for example, US Cyber Consequences Unit, Overview by the US-CCU of the Cyber Campaign against Georgia in August of 2008, US Cyber Consequences Unit (2009) www.registan.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/US-CCU-Georgia-Cyber-Campaign-Overview.pdf (last accessed 25 February 2011); Project Grey Goose, Phase I Report: Russia/Georgia Cyber War – Findings and Analysis (2008).\n59 US Cyber Consequences Unit, Overview; Project Grey Goose, Phase I Report; Tikk, Kaska and Vihul, Cyber Incidents, 66–79.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nARMED ATTACK AND RESPONSE IN THE DIGITAL AGE\nin some cases the transmission routes, to a standstill in a DDoS attack. Botnets have been utilised in most major DDoS attacks reported to date, including against Estonia in 2007 and Georgia in 2008.⁶⁰\nThe inclusion of backdoor payloads in malware raises interesting questions in relation to anticipatory self-defence.⁶¹ It is clear that a backdoor has no other purpose than to allow an intruder control over the infected computer (whether by direct intrusion or remote control) at a later date. A question which must then be addressed is whether a state has the right to respond in anticipatory self-defence against the perpetrators of a computer network attack with a backdoor payload. Although a backdoor can be used for attacks at any point until it is discovered and removed, and such attacks may have far more serious consequences, including those which would qualify as an armed attack, in most cases, the later use is to send spam or launch DDoS attacks causing inconvenience and only economic damage. Without further information about the purpose or target of any later attack, the mere creation of a backdoor by a state adversary is not indicative of the type or gravity of the attack to follow; indeed the creation of a backdoor may merely be evidence of espionage.⁶² Most importantly from a legal perspective, the existence of a backdoor would not meet the ‘imminent’ criteria for lawful self-defence, as the timescale for any subsequent attack is variable; the attack could be launched within days or years.\nOther network intrusions may more indicative, but they will be highly dependent on the circumstances. Two points deserve comment. First, the method of delivery means that there may be little warning of an impending computer network attack; this was one of Greenwood’s additional factors to be considered when determining whether an attack is imminent.⁶³ However, Greenwood’s second factor, the gravity of threat, will depend entirely on the individual threat; as pointed out in the previous chapter, one of the difficulties with assessing computer\n⁶⁰ See, for example, Gadi Evron, ‘Battling Botnets and Online Mobs’ (2008) 9(1) GJIA 121, 124; Tikk, Kaska and Vihul, Cyber Incidents.\n⁶¹ A backdoor is a piece of code which opens a hidden or undocumented access point to the compromised computer or system, bypassing the authentication and security protocols and allowing remote access.\n⁶² Backdoors have been found on computers allegedly compromised by Chinese hackers.\n⁶³ Greenwood, ‘Pre-Emptive Use of Force’, 16.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nARMED ATTACK\n91\nnetwork attacks is that they span the ‘spectrum of consequentiality’.64 While computer network attacks against critical infrastructure such as electricity grids, dams and oil pipelines would be devastating to modern society, and may result in death and property damage, to date no computer network attack has been launched that would be comparable to the threat posed by a nuclear, biological or chemical weapon. In this regard, with the very survival of the state not in question, it is unlikely that the threat would be assessed as imminent.\n## 1.1.4. The ‘Bush doctrine’ of pre-emptive self-defence65\nIn 2002 and 2006 the United States released two security strategy documents containing what appears to be a highly controversial attempt at enlarging the right to self-defence to include the use of force to preempt an attack which is merely threatened, but is not imminent. As Gray points out, there is some uncertainty as to the exact scope of the US claims; however, international criticism of the ‘Bush doctrine’ was both widespread and fierce.66 The 2002 National Security Strategy provided that:67\nWe must be prepared to stop rogue states and their terrorist clients before they are able to threaten or use weapons of mass destruction against the United States and our allies ...\n... Legal scholars and international jurists often conditioned the legitimacy of pre-emption on the existence of an imminent threat – most often a visible mobilization of armies, navies, and air forces preparing to attack.\nWe must adapt the concept of imminent threat to the capabilities and objectives of today’s adversaries ... The greater the threat, the greater is the risk of inaction – and the more compelling the case for taking anticipatory action to defend ourselves, even if uncertainty remains as to the time and place of the enemy’s attack. To forestall or prevent such hostile acts by our adversaries, the United States will, if necessary, act pre-emptively.\n64 Schmitt, ‘Normative Framework’, 912.\n65 This is also known as preventative or predictive self-defence in security studies circles. There is also much confusion in the legal literature regarding what exactly is being referred to by the terms anticipatory, pre-emptive and preventative self-defence.\n66 Gray, Use of Force (3rd edn), 211; Moir, Resort to Force, 79.\n67 White House, The National Security Strategy of the United States of America, White House, 2002), 15, www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/nss/nss_sep2002.pdf (last accessed 5 July 2011).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nARMED ATTACK AND RESPONSE IN THE DIGITAL AGE\nThe sentiments of the 2002 report are repeated in the National Security Strategy 2006.⁶⁸ While at first glance, this may appear to extrapolate logically based on the contingencies of modern weaponry, it compromises the basic premise of anticipatory self-defence laid down in the Caroline case and the evidence of state practice which has evolved the doctrine since. Greenwood has noted, far from removing the requirement of imminence ‘... practice also shows that the right of anticipatory self-defence is confined to instances where the armed attack is imminent’.⁶⁹ As noted above, while Greenwood accepts that the notion of imminence must take into account the gravity of the threat and its method of deliverance, he goes on to state: ‘In so far as talk of a doctrine of “pre-emption” is intended to refer to a broader right of self-defence to respond to threats that might materialize at some time in the future, such a doctrine has no basis in law.’⁷⁰ The issue has been debated extensively in the legal literature and will not be repeated here, save to say that state practice has not indicated widespread support for the doctrine, and both UN reports on security have rejected any wider right of pre-emptive self-defence, indicating it is for the Security Council to take pre-emptive action.⁷¹ In 2010 legal commentators watched with interest to see what the policy of the new US administration would be. However they were to be disappointed; while downplaying the idea of pre-emption, the Obama administration’s National Security Strategy 2010 does not dismiss it, merely stating that states must ‘adhere to standards that govern the use of force’ without elaborating further on what those standards might be.⁷² The relevance of this apparent\n⁶⁸ White House, National Security Strategy of the United States of America (White House, 2006), 23. Although Gray notes the striking absence of any express reference to international law, the 2006 report does state that ‘the United States will, if necessary, act pre-emptively in exercising our inherent right of self-defense’, most likely an implicit reference to Art. 51 of the Charter: Christine D.

Pinprick attacks or accumulation of events theory\nComputer network attacks falling below the armed attack threshold may still trigger a forcible response by states. The most likely strategy utilising computer network attacks is to launch a swarm of lesser attacks, rather than a single large strike qualifying as an armed attack. In a short story published in 1998, John Arquilla detailed what a sustained cyber attack might look like:77 power blackouts, followed by weekly virus attacks of the magnitude of the Nimda, Slammer or Mydoom viruses, oil pipeline ruptures all launched within a matter of days of one another. While some of these attacks may cross the threshold of uses of force under Article 2(4), it is unlikely that any taken on their own would be considered an armed attack under current international law. An analogy may be drawn with cases of repeated cross-border incursions. States have claimed a right to act in self-defence\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nARMED ATTACK AND RESPONSE IN THE DIGITAL AGE\nagainst a series of small-scale incursions or attacks as collectively amounting to a single armed attack. The ‘pinprick’ or ‘accumulation of events’ theory has been unsuccessfully argued in the past by several states, including the United Kingdom,⁷⁸ the United States,⁷⁹ South Africa and Israel,⁸⁰ in an attempt to justify actions purportedly taken in self-defence, that might otherwise be disproportionate. Although the Security Council rejected the claims by these states, each time it has done so on the specific facts of the case and on grounds that such actions were disproportionate. In each instance the condemnation by the Security Council suggested that the actions were unlawful reprisals, rather than commenting on the doctrinal issue of the scope of self-defence.⁸¹ Likewise, the International Court of Justice has avoided expressly discussing the issue, although it appears willing to contemplate the possibility of an accumulation of events amounting to an armed attack. The Court in the Nicaragua (Merits) case commented with regard to the incursions by Nicaragua into the territory of Honduras and Costa Rica:⁸²\nVery little information is available to the Court as to the circumstances of these incursions or to their possible motivations, which renders it difficult to decide whether they may be treated for legal purposes as amounting, singly or collectively, to an ‘armed attack’ by Nicaragua on either or both States.\n⁷⁸ In 1964 the Southern Arab Federation (SAF) which had military links with the United Kingdom, complained of an armed attack by the Yemen which consisted of a ‘series of aggressions’; invoking collective self-defence at the SAF’s request, the UK launched an air strike and destroyed a fort. The Security Council did not accept the reasoning and issued a statement condemning reprisals as ‘incompatible with the principles and purposes of the UN’. SC Res 188, 9 April 1964, as cited in Jean Combacau, ‘The Exception of Self Defence in U.N Practice’ in A. Cassese (ed.), The Current Legal Regulation of the Use of Force (Martinus Nijhoff, Dordrecht, 1986) 9–38, 27.\n⁷⁹ The US claimed it was acting in self-defence against alleged attacks by North Vietnamese naval vessels in the Gulf of Tonkin.

See ibid.\n⁸¹ Gray, Use of Force (3rd edn), 155.\n⁸² Nicaragua (Merits), para. 231. It should be noted that the Court found that there had not been an armed attack by Nicaragua based on additional circumstances.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSELF-DEFENCE AGAINST NON-STATE ACTORS\n95\nThis statement would seem to indicate a willingness on the part of the Court to consider that a series of small-scale attacks on a target may amount to an armed attack when viewed collectively. This view is reiterated in the Oil Platforms, Cameroon/Nigeria and Armed Activities (DRC v. Uganda) cases.⁸³ In all three cases, while not expressly discussing the doctrine, the Court appears to permit the concept of an armed attack through cumulative attacks; however, the Court found that neither the United States, Cameroon nor Uganda respectively had sufficiently proved the facts or imputability to the other party.⁸⁴ This doctrine has obvious application for the victims of protracted campaigns involving low-intensity computer network attacks. However, as with their conventional equivalents, the devil will be in the detail, conclusively proving that the attribution of computer network attacks is a notoriously difficult and time-consuming task.⁸⁵\nOne final point should be noted: not all attacks which are launched from multiple computers will require a cumulative approach to qualify as an armed attack. A DDoS attack of sufficient scale and effect to elevate it above a ‘mere frontier incident’ would be considered a single attack as the attack originates from a single controller.⁸⁶ That is, although the attack appears to come from large numbers of computers in disparate locations, the compromised computers all receive their attack and targeting instructions via command and control servers manipulated from a single controlling ‘master’ which directs the botnet.⁸⁷ This is merely the electronic equivalent of an attack using more than one soldier, or a wave of bombers in an air strike.\n## 2. Self-defence against non-state actors\nOne of the most difficult issues in contemporary jus ad bellum is the permitted response of states to attacks by non-state actors. The difficulty\n⁸³ Case Concerning the Land and Maritime Boundary between Cameroon and Nigeria (Cameroon v. Nigeria: Equatorial Guinea Invervening) (2002) ICJ Reports, International Court of Justice, para. 323; Oil Platforms Case, para. 64; Armed Activities Case, para. 146.\n⁸⁴ Oil Platforms Case, para. 64.\n⁸⁵ See section 3, below.\n⁸⁶ For a detailed description of DDoS attacks, see Bennett Todd, Distributed Denial of Service Attacks (2000), www.linuxsecurity.com/resource_files/intrusion_detection/ddos-faq.html (last accessed 12 April 2011).\n⁸⁷ In traditional botnets this is generally through an Internet Relay Chat (IRC) Server. In newer peer-to-peer based botnets, such as the Storm worm, the controller publishes commands at specific keys in the network to be found by infected machines. However, the net result is the same.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nARMED ATTACK AND RESPONSE IN THE DIGITAL AGE\nstems in part from the fact that Article 2(4) and Article 51 do not entirely correspond in their wording.⁸⁸ As has been noted above, Article 2(4) applies only in the international relations between states and thus does not apply to non-state actors; conversely, Article 51 refers to an inherent right of self-defence which is triggered ‘if an armed attack occurs’, with no mention of by whom the attack has been launched. Those arguing for a restricted right point to Article 51’s role as an exception to the prohibition contained in Article 2(4) to argue that it should likewise be constrained to armed attacks by states. Those, including the present author, who consider there is a broader right of self-defence point to state practice, the fact that Article 51 reflects an ‘inherent right’ rather than establishing one, and the recognition by the International Court of Justice in the Nicaragua (Merits) case that the Charter by no means reflects the whole of the body of law governing force.⁸⁹\nAs noted above, the International Court of Justice in its controversial decision in the Nicaragua (Merits) case, has addressed the issue of when a state might be held responsible for indirect military action by rebels acting ‘on behalf’ of a foreign state, establishing the test of ‘effective control’.⁹⁰ For computer network attacks, where attribution is one of the major problems, this test will prove particularly difficult to satisfy and commentators have been quick to point out the advantages that such plausible deniability will offer to sending states. However, the question of whether a state has a right to respond with force to an armed attack by a non-state actor absent a degree of state complicity has proved a far more difficult question, and one on which the International Court of Justice has been reluctant to comment. The issue has been covered extensively in recent legal literature, and it is not proposed to conduct a full survey of the arguments here, other than to note that there appears to be a divergence between the limited jurisprudence of the Court and emerging state practice on the issue.⁹¹\nIt is safe to say that the Court’s treatment of the matter has caused more confusion than clarification. In its advisory opinion on the Wall, in a statement described as both ‘opaque’ and ‘startling in its\n⁸⁸ Moir, Resort to Force, 22.\n⁸⁹ For the latter point see Nicaragua (Merits), para. 176.\n⁹⁰ Although note also the alternate test established by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia in the Tadic case which specified an ‘effective control’ test.\n⁹¹ For a full discussion of the issues, see, for example, Gray, Use of Force (3rd edn); Moir, Resort to Force.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSELF-DEFENCE AGAINST NON-STATE ACTORS\n97\nbrevity',92 the Court stated that ‘Article 51 of the Charter thus recognises the existence of an inherent right of self-defence in the case of armed attack by one State against another State. However Israel does not claim that the attacks against it are imputable to a foreign State.’93 The Court goes on to note that the threat to which Israel is responding emanates from territory which is controlled by Israel. Although some commentators have taken this to mean that there is no right of self-defence against non-state actors, Gray has argued that this is merely a statement of the basic right of self-defence and that the Court does not say this is the only time there is a right to self-defence.94 The Court once again had an opportunity to consider the right of states to use force against attacks by non-state actors in the Armed Activities case between DRC and Uganda. The Court, however, chose to limit itself strictly to a discussion of the attributability of the acts complained of to a state – applying the Nicaragua test – and expressly declined to discuss the issue of ‘whether and under what conditions contemporary international law provides for a right of self defence against large-scale attacks by irregular forces’.95 However, as Moir has pointed out, by deciding that Uganda’s actions could not amount to self-defence as the attacks complained of could not be attributed to the DRC, they effectively answered the question in the negative in any case.96\nSurveys of state practice, on the other hand, tend to suggest a much greater willingness on the part of the international community to accept the possibility of self-defence against armed attacks by non-state actors without attribution to a state.97 Moir notes, however, that a certain level of support and involvement on the part of the state is required, and is consistently asserted by states claiming the right.98 Thomas Franck suggests that measures taken in self-defence against non-state actors will be accepted by the international community where victim states have identified correctly the place from where it was attacked, that the authorities in that place deliberately, knowingly\n92 Gray, Use of Force (3rd edn); Sean D. Murphy, ‘Self-Defense and the Israeli Wall Advisory Opinion: An Ipse Dixit from the Court?’ (2005) 99 AJIL 62, 62.\n93 The Wall Case, para. 139.\n94 Gray, Use of Force (3rd edn), 135.\n95 Armed Activities Case, para. 147.\n96 Moir, Resort to Force, 137.\n97 For a survey of the relevant practice see Gray, Use of Force (3rd edn), 195–202, 234–52; Moir, Resort to Force, 22–31, 140–7.\n98 Moir, Resort to Force, 149.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nARMED ATTACK AND RESPONSE IN THE DIGITAL AGE\nor recklessly permitted the attack to occur, and that the victim state's response is proportionate.⁹⁹ For computer network attacks each of these factors raise additional issues. First, as discussed in section 3 below, correctly identifying and attributing an attack to a particular perpetrator in a timely manner is one of the most difficult problems in the field of computer network attacks, both from a technical standpoint and a legal one. To be able to do so in a manner that is clear and verifiable by the international community so as to back a claim for the legitimate exercise of self-defence will be an added level of difficulty. Second, even once computer forensics have established the origins of the attacks, proving a sufficient level of support and involvement by a state will be difficult. For example, the computer network attacks against Georgia demonstrated a high level of coordination between the cyber attacks launched by ‘patriotic hackers’ and the military operations carried out by Russia. Russia has denied any involvement with the attacks, and no evidence has been found of state organisations guiding or directing the attacks ‘be it because there was none, because the collection efforts were not far-reaching or deep enough to identify those connections, or because involvement by state organisations was conducted in a way to purposefully avoid attribution’.¹⁰⁰ There was certainly not enough to prove involvement of the Russian authorities in any official capacity,¹⁰¹ particularly absent the context of the military operations.¹⁰² In addition, states will find it very difficult to prevent or even be aware of computer network attacks emanating from their territory, particularly given the high prevalence of technologies such as proxy servers.\nThe final factor raised by Franck in determining whether the international community is likely to accept a claim by a state acting in self-defence against a non-state actor is the proportionality of the response. The question of proportionality is discussed in section 4 below; however, there are a few issues which pertain specifically to non-state actors. First, states have been quick to condemn actions\n⁹⁹ Franck, Recourse to Force, 68.\n¹⁰⁰ Project Grey Goose, Phase I Report, 3.\n¹⁰¹ Some investigators provided circumstantial evidence of possible involvement by individual officials within the Russian administration; however, many experts remain sceptical of these claims. See generally Tikk, Kaska and Vihul, Cyber Incidents, 74–6.\n¹⁰² It will be recalled that the computer network attacks began prior to the physical invasion and continued after the ceasefire.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nATTRIBUTION\npurportedly taken in self-defence which have targeted the infrastructure of the host state.¹⁰³ Given that most computer network attacks by non-state actors utilise this infrastructure, it may prove difficult for victim states to find an acceptable target. Secondly, the dispersed nature of many computer network attacks means that the non-state actors responsible for the attack may be resident in several different host states, complicating the proportionality assessment of any forcible response. It should be noted, however, that the most obvious example of such a dispersed attack, the DDoS attack, would rarely rise to the level of gravity required for an armed attack, absent involvement in a wider programme of attacks that could be responded to under the doctrine of accumulation of events.\nOne final point deserves comment: computer network attacks may also provide a unique opportunity for states to take action against non-state actors without violating the territorial integrity of the state from which they are acting; however, non-state actors are less likely to have infrastructure that would provide viable targets for forcible computer network attacks.¹⁰⁴\n# 3. Attribution\nOne of the major problems with any computer network attack is the attribution of the attack to a particular actor. While the origin of some attacks becomes immediately evident, either because the attacker identifies themselves,¹⁰⁵ or because they precede traditional attacks that are easily attributed to a particular source,¹⁰⁶ other attacks will be launched anonymously. Given the common use of botnets and the frequency of IP spoofing that takes place in computer network attacks,¹⁰⁷\n¹⁰³ See, for example, the international condemnation of the Israeli attacks against Lebanon in 2006 in response to attacks by Hezbollah, and also the comment of the ICJ in the Armed Activities case that the taking of airports and towns many kilometres away from the site of the series of transborder attacks complained of did not seem proportionate: Armed Activities Case, para. 147.\n¹⁰⁴ See, for example, the opinion of Judge Higgins in the Wall case, dissenting on the grounds that non-forcible measures such as the construction of a wall do not really fall within the concept of self-defence.\n¹⁰⁵ For example, the 'I Love You' virus source code contained the 'signature' of the author.\n¹⁰⁶ For example, the Israeli attack on the Syrian air-defences in advance of an air strike.\n¹⁰⁷ IP spoofing essentially forges the data identifying the sending computer in the header of a data packet so that it appears to originate from a different IP address, thus any response is sent to the forged computer.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nARMED ATTACK AND RESPONSE IN THE DIGITAL AGE\nit is difficult to state with any certainty that the entity that appears to be the perpetrator of the attack is in fact the ultimate attacker.\nIP spoofing can be used either to simply mask the origin of an attack, or in a deliberate attempt to place the blame for an attack on another party. An early example of the latter problem occurred in 1999 when a denial of service attack was launched against the US Department of Transport. The attack appeared to emanate from a server in Maryland run by followers of the Falun Gong movement; in fact, the attack was designed to take down both the Maryland server and the Department of Transport network server, leaving the Falun Gong bearing the blame. However, the attackers had blundered and the attack was traced to a computer located at the address of China's Ministry of Public Security. No information is publicly available regarding the US response to this attack; however, in 2002 Richard Clarke, then White House technology advisor, stated before a Senate Judiciary subcommittee hearing on cyber terrorism that the government had never been able to prove to their satisfaction that a particular government was responsible for a specific unauthorised intrusion.\nThe proliferation of botnets also makes attribution difficult. As the 2007 denial of service attacks against Estonia proved, it can be very difficult to differentiate between attacks that originate from a particular address and those which are merely utilising a compromised computer. Although some of the IP addresses involved in the attacks against Estonia were traced to official IP addresses of Russian state authorities, Russia denied any involvement and claimed that these computers had been compromised and were being manipulated from outside the Kremlin. Subsequent reports by cyber security analysts tend to back this claim, pointing to the lack of evidence and also noting the possibility of spoofing the IP address of the attacker.\nOf course, problems of attribution aren't restricted to cyberspace. Armed attacks following more conventional patterns are often carried out anonymously, or responsibility is claimed by armed groups which appear unlikely to have the resources required for such an attack. Further, in the case of state-sponsored terrorism, it is unlikely that any state will step forward to take responsibility for kinetic acts, let alone electronic ones. Those factors aside, a victim state must still establish\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nATTRIBUTION\na link between the attacking group and the sponsoring state, the same approach must be taken with electronic attacks.¹¹⁰ This may be particularly difficult to prove where attacks are launched by groups or loose affiliations of individuals in conjunction with traditional state action. For example, when Russia moved troops into South Ossetia following the Georgian offensive in 2008, the air strikes and ground forces were accompanied by a series of computer network attacks against Georgian servers. While these attacks were certainly not serious enough to amount to armed attacks, given Georgia's limited internet connectivity, they illustrate the capacity for other actors to effectively 'join-in' a conflict with or without state authorisation. Several security analysts reported botnets allegedly controlled by the Russian Business Network, a group known to be linked to cyber crime, launching denial of service attacks at Georgian servers. However, software was also freely available for download to individual computers from Russian language websites such as 'stopgeorgia.ru' along with a list of targets, making joining the cyber offensive as simple as a few mouse clicks.¹¹¹ As noted previously, the Russian government denies any involvement with the attacks;¹¹² however, the issue raises the difficult question of state responsibility for non-state actors and the necessity or degree of state involvement or complicity required before force can be used in self-defence against the state. This book does not address this issue in depth; suffice it to note that there is little agreement in the international community on the issue in relation to conventional attacks, let alone computer network attacks.¹¹³ However, it is clear that a state must not knowingly allow its territory to be used as a sanctuary for terrorists or armed bands bent on attacking military targets or civilian objects in another country.¹¹⁴\nThe difficulty of attribution also affects the victim state's ability to engage in forcible countermeasures in self-defence.¹¹⁵ The Court in the\n¹¹⁰ Dinstein, 'CNA and Self-Defense', 112.\n¹¹¹ John Markoff, 'Before the Gunfire, Cyberattacks', New York Times, 13 August 2008; Evgeny Morozov, 'An Army of Ones and Zeroes: How I Became a Soldier in the Georgia-Russia Cyberwar', Slate, 14 August 2008, www.slate.com/id/2197514/ (last accessed 12 April 2011).\n¹¹² Siobhan Gorman, 'Georgia States Computers Hit by Cyberattack', Wall Street Journal (New York), 12 August 2008, A9.\n¹¹³ For a discussion of legal attribution and state responsibility for non-state actors' use of force see generally Gray, Use of Force (2nd edn).\n¹¹⁴ Ian Brownlie, 'International Law and the Activities of Armed Bands' (1958) 7 International and Comparative Law Quarterly 712, 734, cited in Dinstein, War, Aggression, and Self-Defense, 206.\n¹¹⁵ Sharp, Cyberspace and the Use of Force, 133, cited in Dinstein, 'CNA and Self-Defense', 111.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nARMED ATTACK AND RESPONSE IN THE DIGITAL AGE\nOil Platforms case held that the burden of proof rests on the state invoking the right of self-defence and that the United States had failed to prove that it had been subject to an armed attack by a particular state, vis Iran.¹¹⁶ ‘[A victim state] must not rush headlong into hasty action predicated on reflexive impulses and unfounded suspicions; it has no choice but to withhold forcible response until hard evidence is collated and the state of affairs is clarified, lest the innocent be endangered.’¹¹⁷ Such hasty reactions could lead to the escalation of hostilities, something the ban on force was intended to prevent. However, the necessity of waiting for hard evidence of responsibility also opens the possibility that any action taken against a perpetrator once responsibility has been confirmed will be classified as an armed reprisal rather than an action taken in self-defence. Armed reprisals are prohibited under international law.¹¹⁸\n## 4. Necessity and proportionality\nAll responses to attacks, whether their means of delivery are kinetic or electronic, are subject to the underlying principles of necessity and proportionality. The International Court of Justice has repeatedly confirmed that self-defence, whether individual or collective, warrants only those measures which are ‘proportional to the armed attack and necessary to respond to it’ as a principle well established in customary international law.¹¹⁹ The principles are not stated in UN Charter but are often traced back to the Webster formulation in the Caroline incident.¹²⁰\nThe principle of necessity requires that any measures taken avowedly in self-defence must have been necessary for that purpose; the principle is strict and objective ‘leaving no room for any measure of discretion’.¹²¹ That is, it is not sufficient that force is used after an armed attack; it must be necessary to repel that attack,¹²² and non-forcible remedies must either prove futile in limine or have in fact been exhausted in an\n¹¹⁶ Oil Platforms Case, paras 57, 61.\n¹¹⁷ Dinstein, ‘CNA and Self-Defense’, 111.\n¹¹⁸ Declaration on Friendly Relations, Principle on the Use of Force, para. 6.\n¹¹⁹ Nicaragua (Merits), paras 176 and 194; Nuclear Weapons Case, para. 41; Oil Platforms Case, para. 74; Armed Activities Case, para. 147.\n¹²⁰ There must be ‘a necessity of defence, instant, overwhelming, leaving no choice of means and no moment for deliberation’.\n¹²¹ Oil Platforms Case, para. 73.\n¹²² Greenwood, ‘Pre-Emptive Use of Force’, 23.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nNECESSITY AND PROPORTIONALITY\n103\nunsatisfactory manner.¹²³ As Roberto Ago notes, ‘had [the state] been able to achieve the same result by measures not involving the use of armed force, it would have no justification for adopting conduct which contravened the general prohibition against the use of armed force’.¹²⁴ For example, in the *Oil Platforms Case* the Court noted that even if the attacks on the *Sea Isle City* and mining of the *Samuel B. Roberts* had been sufficiently imputed to Iran, the US had not complained to Iran of the military activities of the platforms, which suggested that the attacks on the platforms was not seen as a necessary act.¹²⁵\nThe principle of necessity also gives rise to a related principle, namely that actions taken in self-defence must generally be taken without undue delay.¹²⁶ In the case of computer network attacks, this may make successful claims of self-defence more difficult. Where the origins of a computer network attack are not obvious, the time taken to conduct computer forensics and establish hard evidence of the identity of the perpetrator may militate against a finding that any subsequent action by the victim state is in self-defence. Similar criticisms were levelled at the United States after a delay of several weeks between the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon and subsequent action in Afghanistan.¹²⁷ Likewise, the Court in the *Nicaragua (Merits)* case also criticised the US for commencing activities purportedly in self-defence several months after the major offensive of the opposition against the government of El Salvador had been completely repulsed, although ultimately dismissing the claim of self-defence on other grounds.¹²⁸ However, Dinstein notes that this requirement must not be construed too strictly; he points to the delay of approximately five months between the invasion of Kuwait and the authorisation of all necessary means by the Security Council.¹²⁹\nThe principle of proportionality requires the weighing of the response against its permitted purpose of halting and repelling the attack, or, in the case of anticipatory self-defence, preventing it from\n¹²³ Dinstein, ‘CNA and Self-Defense’, 109.\n¹²⁴ Roberto Ago, ‘Addendum to the Eighth Report on State Responsibility’ (1980) II UN Y.B.

Whether or not an act is proportionate will necessarily be dependent on the facts of the situation; however, the action must not be retaliatory or punitive, its lawfulness cannot be measured ‘except by its capacity for achieving the desired result’.¹³⁰ This raises an interesting question with respect to computer network attacks; namely whether it would ever be proportionate to use traditional armed force against an electronic attack. The answer must surely be in the affirmative. Proportionality does not restrict the defending state to the same weapons or the same numbers of armed forces as the attacking state; nor is it necessarily limited to action on its own territory.¹³¹ Therefore it would be open to the victim of a computer network attack to use whatever weapons it has at its disposal to repel the attack, as long as the response is proportionate to that purpose. As Ago notes:¹³²\nIn the case of self-defence, it was essential to avoid the error of thinking that there should be some proportionality between the action of the aggressor and the action of the state defending itself. Proportionality could be judged only in terms of the objective of the action, which was to repel an attack and prevent it from succeeding. No limitations that might prejudice the success of a response to attack could be placed on the State suffering the attack. The concept of reasonable action must of course enter into the matter, since self-defence could not justify a genuine act of aggression committed in response to an armed attack of limited proportions.\nThus, if a computer network attack is being used to prepare the battlespace for a conventional attack, the use of military force in response must be proportionate in relation to the need to repel the attack as a whole. However, it should be noted that while physically bombing the attacking computers and their owners may be legal, it is not necessarily the preferred method of response.¹³³ Only a few examples of state intrusion have been made public to date, and no large-scale attacks as would justify a forcible response have been reported. Further, state practice in response to electronic probes emanating from other states have not resulted in forcible responses.¹³⁴\n¹³⁰ Ago, ‘Addendum’, 69 para. 121.\n¹³¹ Gray, *Use of Force* (3rd edn), 150.\n¹³² Roberto Ago, ‘State Responsibility’ (1980) Vol. 1 *UN Y.B.

For example, the attack on the US Department of Transport that was attributed to the Falun Gong originated elsewhere, and despite initial accusations against Russia, the attacks on Estonia and Georgia are now widely believed to be the work of independent ‘patriotic hackers’. As noted, routing attacks through other actors, or spoofing their IP addresses to cast blame may serve as a political end in itself.\n## 5. Countermeasures against unlawful acts\nWhere a computer network attack does not rise to the level of an armed attack, a state may still respond with proportionate countermeasures. However, where forcible countermeasures are taken in response to an ordinary breach of international law, not constituting an armed attack, they are unlawful.¹³⁶\nHowever, an alternate line of reasoning, arising out of the controversial gap theory put forward by the majority of the International Court of Justice in the Nicaragua (Merits) decision, appears to have muddied the waters somewhat. The Court held that acts committed by Nicaragua against El Salvador, Honduras and Costa Rica amounted to less grave forms of ‘illegal military intervention’.¹³⁷ The Court held that that ‘proportionate counter-measures’ were permissible on the part of the victim state; however, they did not create any entitlement by any third state to take collective countermeasures involving the use\nHezbollah telecommunications network. The response was condemned by states; however, given the non-international nature of the dispute, it does not provide any useful indication of state practice in this regard. See generally ‘Hezbollah Takes over West Beirut’, BBC News, 9 May 2008, http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/7391600.stm (last accessed 15 July 2011).\n¹³⁵ Jensen, ‘Computer Attacks’, 231.\n¹³⁶ Dinstein, War, Aggression, and Self-Defense, 226.\n¹³⁷ The Court held that Nicaragua did supply aid to rebels in the territories of El Salvador, but had insufficient evidence of the nature, scale and continuance of such aid. The Court further held that Nicaragua was responsible for certain transborder military incursions into Honduras and Costa Rica. Nicaragua (Merits), paras 152, 164.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nARMED ATTACK AND RESPONSE IN THE DIGITAL AGE\nof force.¹³⁸ The Court did not venture an opinion as to what form the individual countermeasures by the victim state might take, or whether they could include the use of force.\nJohn Hargrove has suggested that there are two possible interpretations of the Court’s statement. Either the Court was saying:¹³⁹\n(a) that there are some acts of force that nobody, not even the victim, may resist by proportionate measures of force; or it was saying (b) that the victim may resist with force provided that it does so alone. There is little to be said in explanation of the latter proposition other than it is simply a[n] ... arbitrary announcement of the Court.\nHargrove argues that allowing forcible countermeasures ‘would in one remarkable stroke manage both to impair the right of self-defense, and to weaken fundamentally the prohibition on the use of force by creating an open-ended and wholly new category of exceptions to Article 2(4) of the Charter, of unknown content and limit.’¹⁴⁰ However, Judge Simma in his separate opinion in the *Oil Platforms* case has argued that the Court in the *Nicaragua (Merits)* case cannot, in the context of that case, have understood that to mean mere pacific reprisals.¹⁴¹ He argues that the Court can only have meant ‘defensive military action “short of” full-scale self-defence’.¹⁴²\nBut we may encounter also a lower level of hostile military action, not reaching the threshold of an ‘armed attack’ within the meaning of Article 51 of the United Nations Charter. Against such hostile acts, a state may of course defend itself, but only within a more limited range and quality of responses (the main difference being that the possibility of collective self-defence does not arise, cf. *Nicaragua*) and bound to necessity, proportionality and immediacy in time in a particularly strict way.\nSimma’s treatment of the conditions in respect of forcible countermeasures is clearly linked to the classic self-defence analysis, rather\n¹³⁸ ‘[A] use of force of a lesser degree of gravity cannot ... produce any entitlement to take collective counter-measures involving the use of force. The acts of which Nicaragua is accused ... could only have justified proportionate counter-measures on the part of the state which had been the victim of these acts, namely El Salvador, Honduras or Costa Rica. They could not justify counter-measures taken by a third state, the United States, and particularly could not justify intervention involving the use of force.’ *Ibid.*, para. 249.\n¹³⁹ Hargrove, *Nicaragua Judgement*, 141.\n¹⁴⁰ *Ibid.*, 142.\n¹⁴¹ *Oil Platforms Case* (per Judge Simma), para. 12.\n¹⁴² *Ibid.*, per Judge Simma, paras 12–13.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOUNTERMEASURES AGAINST UNLAWFUL ACTS\n107\nthan the criteria for non-forcible countermeasures set out below. This argument may prove beneficial to a state which is subjected to computer network attacks that rise to the level of force, particularly where it is unsure whether its planned proportionate response might likewise be considered an illegal use of force. It should be noted, however, that this is a minority view and that most commentators maintain that forcible countermeasures are prohibited under international law as armed reprisals.\nWhere a computer network attack does not amount to an armed attack (or a use of force), any countermeasures taken by the victim state will be conditional on, and limited by, the law relating to countermeasures.¹⁴³ In the Case Concerning the Gabcikovo-Nagymaros Project, the International Court of Justice set out a three-part test justifying proportionate countermeasures. First, the action must be taken in response to an internationally wrongful act of another state and be directed against that state. Second, the victim state must have called upon the offending state to discontinue its wrongful conduct or to make reparation for it. And finally, the effects of the countermeasure must be commensurate with the injury suffered, taking account of the rights in question.¹⁴⁴ In this regard the test for proportionality differs between countermeasures and self-defence, where the response must be proportional to the threat, rather than the actual harm suffered. However, the Court also stated that the purpose of the countermeasures must be to induce the wrongdoing state to comply with its obligations under international law, and that the measure must therefore be reversible.¹⁴⁵ In respect of a computer network attack this would seem to fit with current state practice; most attacks to date have merely resulted in states requesting the alleged perpetrator of the attack to cease their actions.¹⁴⁶ However, the nature of computer network attacks, including the type of attacks they make possible and, most importantly, their ability to be reversed, makes computer network attacks particularly useful as a countermeasure against a previous wrongful act of a state. For example, a series\n¹⁴³ See generally United Nations, International Law Commission and James Crawford, The International Law Commission's Articles on State Responsibility: Introduction, Text, and Commentaries (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, New York, 2002).\n¹⁴⁴ Case Concerning the Gabcikovo-Nagymaros Project (1997) ICJ Reports 3, International Court of Justice, para. 85.\n¹⁴⁵ Ibid., para. 87.\n¹⁴⁶ Although it should be noted that in all reported cases to date the suspected perpetrator has denied any involvement with the attack.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nARMED ATTACK AND RESPONSE IN THE DIGITAL AGE\nof blackouts in response to an internationally wrongful act may be a useful coercive measure.\nThe 1998 Zapatista ‘Floodnet’ attacks on the Pentagon’s website by the Electronic Disturbance Theatre also provide a model for how electronic countermeasures might work against non-state actors. US Department of Defense specialists created a program that would recognise the Floodnet applet installed on computers trying to access the Department of Defense website.¹⁴⁷ Once the applet was identified, a program was sent back to the activist’s computer to shut down their web browser, thus ending the attack.¹⁴⁸ Although criticisms were levelled at the Department for not thoroughly considering the legal ramifications of such a response,¹⁴⁹ the United States’ decision to respond electronically, in this instance, against an attack which they had been expecting, must be considered a proportionate countermeasure, particularly against a demonstrably non-violent protest group. There was some speculation that this approach was being renewed by the US Department of Defense in its ‘active defence’ policy released in 2011;¹⁵⁰ statements made by Lynn prior to release of the policy indicated that the US intended to stop threats before they reached Department of Defense networks. However, the unclassified version of the Pentagon’s cyber-security strategy appears to focus the concept of active defence on network speed hunting for malicious activity within Department of Defense networks and systems, rather than pushing back beyond the network boundaries.¹⁵¹ The danger with adopting the push-back approach against states is the risk of escalation of such countermeasures into forcible responses, a situation which the Security Council would be likely to determine a threat to international peace and security, as seen in the following section.\n¹⁴⁷ An applet is a small piece of code designed to perform one specific task within another application.\n¹⁴⁸ Brian Friel, ‘DoD Launches Internet Counterattack’, Government Executive, 18 September 1998, http://govexec.com/dailyfed/0998/091898b1.htm (last accessed 12 April 2011).\n¹⁴⁹ George I.

Security Council authorisation and collective measures\nOther than self-defence under Article 51, the only other exception to the prohibition on the use of force under the UN Charter is the authorisation of collective security measures under Chapter VII. The Security Council has ‘primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security’ and may recommend or authorise member states to engage in measures, which may include the use of force, in order to pursue this aim. Article 39 provides:\nThe Security Council shall determine the existence of any threat to the peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression and shall make recommendations, or decide what measures shall be taken in accordance with Articles 41 and 42, to maintain or restore international peace and security.\nThis raises two separate issues for the use of computer network attacks. First, when will the Security Council consider computer network attacks to be a ‘threat to the peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression’; and second, under what circumstances might measures authorised by the Security Council under Chapter VII include computer network attacks?\nAs noted, prior to the Security Council recommending action, it must determine that a ‘threat to the peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression’ exists under Article 39. In practice, the Council has almost exclusively exercised its powers by finding a ‘threat to international peace and security’, even in situations where a breach of the peace or act of aggression is obvious;¹⁵² thus the analysis will concentrate on this broader standard. Whether or not there are any limits on the Security Council’s ability to determine a threat to the peace is the subject of debate amongst legal scholars;¹⁵³ however, it is generally accepted that the Council possesses considerable discretion in this respect. The resulting range of situations in which the Security Council has found a threat to the peace is increasingly broad and includes the danger of violent countermeasures by states to violations of international law, regardless of their admissibility.¹⁵⁴ The Council has also\n¹⁵² Jochen Frowein, ‘Article 39’ in B. Simma (ed.), The Charter of the United Nations: A Commentary (2nd edn, Oxford University Press, 2002) 717, 722; Gray, Use of Force (3rd edn), 256. All instances in which the Security Council has found an act of aggression or breach of the peace have involved inter-state conflicts.\n¹⁵³ See generally Erika De Wet, The Chapter VII Powers of the United Nations Security Council (Hart, Oxford, 2004), 133-4.\n¹⁵⁴ Frowein, ‘Article 39’, 722.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nARMED ATTACK AND RESPONSE IN THE DIGITAL AGE\nfound threats to the peace in internal conflicts such as those in Liberia, Rwanda, Sierra Leone and East Timor; violations of human rights and humanitarian law in Somalia, Rwanda and Eastern Zaire; violations of democratic principles in Haiti and Sierra Leone; terrorism; nuclear proliferation and even failure to cooperate with international prosecutions. These examples illustrate the broad discretion that the Security Council has to determine that a threat to the peace exists; however, Frowein has argued that this does not mean that the notion of a threat to the peace has become limitless. He argues that a threat to the peace exists when, in a particular situation, a danger of the use of force on a considerable scale arises. Although the Security Council has not considered any computer network attacks to date, based on this assessment it would certainly appear that a computer network attack would constitute a threat to the peace where it is of sufficient gravity that a state is likely to respond to it with force, regardless of whether it is categorised as an armed attack, or where the type of attack indicates further violence to follow, whether electronically or by kinetic means.\nOnce the Security Council has determined a threat to the peace, the Council may make recommendations, or require states to take action under Articles 40, 41 and 42 of the Charter, for the restoration or maintenance of international peace and security. Interestingly, once the Security Council has deemed a situation a threat to the peace, it 'is free to take measures against any entity which it considers to be an obstructive factor in the restoration of peace'.

Provisional measures are made without prejudice to the rights, claims or position of the parties, but failure to comply with them will be taken into account by the Security Council.\nArticle 41 allows the Security Council to decide:\n[W]hat measures not involving the use of armed force are to be employed to give effect to its decisions, and it may call upon the Members of the United Nations to apply such measures. These may include complete or partial interruption of economic relations and of rail, sea, air, postal, telegraphic, radio, and other means of communication, and the severance of diplomatic relations. (emphasis added)\nThis would also allow for the disruption of individual internet access, such as that demonstrated by the United States in response to the 1998 attack by the Electronic Disturbance Theatre, and may also allow for the total disconnection of a country from the internet by a third party, in the same manner as the self-imposed internet blackouts attempted internally by regimes in Egypt, Myanmar and Libya.¹⁶⁴ Some attempts have been made to argue that such a measure would be the electronic equivalent of a blockade (which would fall within the forceful measures provided for in Article 42);¹⁶⁵ however, the present author does not consider that this is an appropriate classification, despite the\n¹⁶³ SC Res 1127, 1997, cited in ibid.\n¹⁶⁴ James Cowie, ‘What Libya Learned from Egypt’, *Renesys Blog*, 5 March 2011, www.renesys.com/blog/2011/03/what-libya-learned-from-egypt.shtml (last accessed 12 April 2011); Jordan Robertson, ‘The Day Part of the Internet Died: Egypt Goes Dark’, *The Washington Times* 28 January 2011, www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/jan/28/day-part-internet-died-egypt-goes-dark/ (last accessed 12 April 2011); OpenNet Initiative, *Pulling the Plug: A Technical Review of the Internet Shutdown in Burma*, OpenNet Initiative (2007), http://opennet.net/sites/opennet.net/files/ONI_Bulletin_Burma_2007.pdf (last accessed 12 April 2011).\n¹⁶⁵ See media reports following both the Estonian and Georgian denial of service attacks.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nARMED ATTACK AND RESPONSE IN THE DIGITAL AGE\nsevere economic effects that this would undoubtedly have on highly technologically dependent states.¹⁶⁶ Electronic measures under Article 41 could arguably also encompass denial of service attacks launched against the media, banking and telecommunications infrastructure of a state, although the shaping of the response to the threat may prove difficult in practice.\nWhere non-forceful measures have been unsuccessful, or if the Security Council determines that such measures would be inadequate, the Council may authorise action under Article 42 by such air, sea or land forces as may be necessary to maintain or restore international peace and security; examples include demonstrations, blockade and other operations by air, sea or land forces of Members of the United Nations.¹⁶⁷ It appears unlikely that the Security Council would consider it necessary to authorise force against a computer network attack; however, where an attack or ongoing series of attacks cannot be prevented or stopped by electronic means, it is within their purview to do so. As noted earlier, force is not necessarily the preferred means of countering a cyber attack because of the distributed nature of many methods of attack.\nA more interesting scenario is the possibility of the Security Council authorising computer network attacks of sufficient gravity to amount to a use of force in response to a threat to the peace. For example, in the past few years the Security Council has passed a series of resolutions expressing its concern over the proliferation risks presented by the Iranian nuclear programme.¹⁶⁸ Although the Council has not explicitly stated that it considers that the programme represents a threat to international peace and security, this is far from unusual; it is clear from the practice of the Council that no formal pronouncement with an express reference to Article 39 is necessary; the use of the language is apparently sufficient.¹⁶⁹ The Council does, however, explicitly state that it is acting under Article 41 of Chapter VII of the Charter, and each resolution calls for member states to implement a series of specific non-forceful measures against Iran. The author has previously concluded that the Stuxnet worm amounts to a use of force as it is\n¹⁶⁶ For example, the OECD estimates the economic impact of shutting down internet and mobile phone services in Egypt for five days in 2011 at US$90 million in direct costs alone.\n¹⁶⁷ Art. 42, UN Charter.\n¹⁶⁸ SC Res 1929 (2010); SC Res 1803 (2008); SC Res 1747 (2007); SC Res 1737 (2006).\n¹⁶⁹ Gray, Use of Force (3rd edn), 256.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCONCLUSION\n113\ngenerally believed to have caused physical damage to approximately 1,000 nuclear centrifuges at the Natanz enrichment facility. Although Resolution 1929 (2010) specifically stresses that it does not authorise any measures exceeding the scope of the resolution,¹⁷⁰ or the threat or use of force, had the measures decided on been taken under Article 42 with its usual phraseology ‘all necessary means’, the Stuxnet worm would have proved an efficient way to achieve one of the aims of the resolution, namely the suspension of enrichment-related activities.\n## 7. Conclusion\nAs with the discussion in the previous chapter relating to the use of force, the classification of computer network attacks as armed attacks sits on top of a deep doctrinal divide between those who would argue for a wide interpretation of the right to self-defence and those who would restrict it. The present author believes that in regard to computer network attacks, a restrictive view of the armed attack threshold and the subsequent right to self-defence is preferable. Classification of computer network attacks which would amount to armed attacks should therefore be restricted to those attacks which cause physical damage to property or persons of a sufficient scale and effect. Given the particular difficulties and length of time involved in accurately attributing attacks and the fact that states acting in self-defence are not restricted to responding in kind, the danger of computer network attacks escalating into traditional conflict is apparent. That is not to say that states cannot respond to computer network attacks that do not rise to the level of an armed attack; a state may still respond with proportionate countermeasures or appeal to the Security Council for a finding that the attacks amount to a threat to the peace.\n¹⁷⁰ Thus even if Stuxnet had not resulted in physical damage but merely stopped the enrichment facility from working it could not have fallen within the terms of the Security Council authorisations.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press"

The UN Charter system admits only two exceptions to the prohibition on the use of force: collective measures authorised by the Security Council acting under Chapter VII of the Charter; or the inherent right of collective or individual self-defence provided for in Article 51.\nThe exact scope of the right of self-defence remains one of the divisive issues in international law, so it is not surprising that its application to the topic of computer network attacks is particularly complex. First, it is difficult to identify the point at which a computer network attack will rise to the level of an 'armed attack', the threshold that triggers a state's right to self-defence. As seen in the previous chapter, traditional international law focuses on personal injury, fatality and damage to physical property as measures of the seriousness of an attack. This approach is favoured by most commentators writing on the subject to date;¹ however, many catastrophically damaging computer network attacks will not cause any of these deleterious consequences. Further, it is likely that many attacks using computer network operations will not come as a single instance, but rather as a series of events which, taken separately, may not be sufficient to qualify as an armed attack. This raises the issue of the right to respond to 'pin-prick' attacks with a single use of force, a concept which has had a chequered history in international law. The likelihood that computer network attacks will\n¹ See Horace B. Robertson, 'Self-Defense against Computer Network Attack under International Law' in M. N. Schmitt and B. T. O'Donnell (eds.), Computer Network Attack and International Law (Naval War College, Newport, RI, 2002) 122–45, 136, for examples of authors adopting the consequence-based approach.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nARMED ATTACK AND RESPONSE IN THE DIGITAL AGE\nbe used in conjunction with, or as a precursor to, a conventional attack may also raise a right to respond to such attacks under the auspices of the controversial doctrine of anticipatory self-defence. For example, will intrusion into an air defence network be sufficient evidence of an imminent attack following the 2007 Israeli raid on the alleged Syrian nuclear site.\nThe second major difficulty with computer network attacks, as opposed to traditional kinetic attacks, is the difficulty of attributing an attack to its original perpetrator. The length of time required to trace an attack makes questions of the necessity of force to repel a computer network attack difficult to satisfy. Questions of proportionality also arise in determining whether it would ever be proportionate to use armed force in response to a computer network attack. This chapter examines these questions in light of current international law, the definition of armed attack and considers in what circumstances force may be used in self-defence against a computer network attack.\nThe final sections address the authorisation to use force under the auspices of Chapter VII Security Council resolutions, and what measures might be taken by states in response to computer network attacks which fail to meet the threshold for lawful self-defence.\n# 1. Armed attack\nThe right of self-defence is a customary law right, inherent in the sovereignty of states; it has been codified for the most part by Article 51 of the UN Charter as follows:\nNothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security. Measures taken by Members in the exercise of this right of self-defence shall be immediately reported to the Security Council and shall not in any way affect the authority and responsibility of the Security Council under the present Charter to take at any time such action as it deems necessary in order to maintain or restore international peace and security.\nThe customary status of the right has been confirmed by the Nicaragua (Merits) case.² Article 51 of the Charter allows self-defence in response to an 'armed attack' and the International Court of Justice has\n² Nicaragua (Merits), para. 176.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nARMED ATTACK\nconfirmed in both the Nicaragua (Merits) and Oil Platforms decisions that nothing short of an armed attack (with the possible exception of an anticipated armed attack) will be sufficient to trigger the right of self-defence under international law.³ The Oil Platforms case also established that it is for the state using force in self-defence to prove that it has been subjected to an armed attack.⁴ However, as with the term ‘force’, the Charter does not provide a definition of ‘armed attack’. Further, the historical predecessors to the Charter system do not offer any interpretive assistance. Neither the Kellogg-Briand Pact nor the Covenant of the League of Nations refer to the term. Both formulate self-defence as a response to aggression; hence all attempts at definition were focused on that term.⁵ The drafting history of the Charter provides evidence that discussions took place on the difference between an attack and an armed attack (based on the fact that the United States draft of 11 May 1945 contained both terms) and although no definitive conclusion was reached, the term was replaced by armed attack only.⁶ Professor Ian Brownlie has pointed out that it is likely that the records of the San Francisco conference contain no definition of the phrase ‘armed attack’ because the term was considered ‘sufficiently clear’ and ‘self-evident’.⁷ That was certainly the case in the drafting of the North Atlantic Treaty around the same time, as evidenced by the comments of the Foreign Relations Committee of the United States Senate which noted that the phrase ‘armed attack’ in Article 5 ‘is ordinarily self evident’ and ‘there is rarely, if ever, any doubt as to whether it has occurred or by whom it was launched’.⁸ The decision of the International Court of Justice in the Nicaragua (Merits) case made clear that armed attacks form a subset of the term ‘force’ in Article 2(4); therefore those actions which have been discussed in the previous chapter as falling outside the ambit of the definition of armed force will subsequently also fail to meet the threshold of an armed attack. However, not every use of force will be an armed attack,\n³ Ibid.; Case Concerning Oil Platforms (Islamic Republic of Iran v. United States of America) (2003), International Court of Justice, para. 51.\n⁴ Oil Platforms Case, para. 57.\n⁵ Stanimir A.

The Court sees no reason to deny that, in customary law, the prohibition of armed attacks may apply to the sending by a State of armed bands to the territory of another State, if such an operation, because of its scale and effects, would have been classified as an armed attack rather than as a mere frontier incident had it been carried out by regular armed forces.\nThe Court goes on to consider that acts such as ‘assistance to rebels in the form of the provision of weapons or logistical or other support’ do not constitute an armed attack, but might nonetheless constitute a threat or use of force, or amount to intervention in the internal or external affairs of other states.¹¹ Despite being the subject of much criticism and discussion, the Court’s decision makes clear that under current international law the definition of ‘armed attack’ is dependent on the ‘scale and effects’ of an attack which must be of sufficient gravity to elevate such actions beyond ‘mere frontier incidents’.¹² The view that an armed attack must be of ‘relatively large scale and with substantial effect’ is reiterated by several leading scholars,¹³ and is in\n⁹ Nicaragua (Merits), para. 195. ¹⁰ Ibid.\n¹¹ Ibid., para. 195, 231. This position was strongly criticised by Judges Schwebel and Jennings in their dissenting opinions, Schwebel holding that the term substantial involvement in the Definition of Aggression meant that an armed attack could include financial and logistical support.\n¹² Ibid., para. 195.\n¹³ See, for example, Randelzhofer, ‘Article 51’, 796 (with accompanying citations). See also Dinstein, ‘CNA and Self-Defense’, 100, noting that the use of force must be of sufficient gravity before armed attack is in progress, no matter that it be of small magnitude.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nARMED ATTACK\nagreement with the de minimis rule for small-scale attacks set out in Article 2 of the Definition of Aggression adopted by the UN General Assembly, an example also given by the Court in the Nicaragua (Merits) case.^[14]\nThe Court's distinction between 'the most grave forms of the use of force (those constituting an armed attack)' and 'other less grave forms',^[15] and the resultant gap between force and armed attack, results in the peculiar situation where an illegal use of force not tantamount to an armed attack may be launched by one state against another, leaving the victim state unable to respond in self-defence. Logically and pragmatically the gap has to be quite narrow, inasmuch as 'there is very little effective protection against states violating the prohibition on the use of force, as long as they do not resort to an armed attack'.^[16] Michael Schmitt has commented that this distinction makes sense in light of the Charter's central purpose to 'maintain international peace and security' as it creates a rebuttable presumption against the resort by states to violence.^[17] Thus he notes 'it is logical to interpret the prohibition on the use of force expansively, but characterize exceptions that lie outside the community decisional architecture, such as self-defense, narrowly'.^[18]\nOther commentators, including Judge Simma in a separate opinion in the Oil Platforms case, have argued, however, that it makes no logical sense to prohibit a state from forcibly defending itself or permitting its allies to come to the state's defence where it is the subject of an unlawful use of force.^[19] Any fears of an unwarranted escalation of an incident can be dealt with under the existing rules pertaining to proportionality.^[20] Despite such debate, following the Nicaragua (Merits) and\n^[14] The Security Council may determine whether actions falling under the examples given in Article 3 do not constitute 'acts of aggression' owing to their lack of gravity.

However, the thresholds of each of these concepts, and the responses which each allows, are yet to be established with any certainty.\nThis uncertainty makes the classification of any computer network attack particularly difficult. As noted previously, the possible effects of computer network attacks 'span the spectrum of consequentiality',[21] thus making classification based on the type of computer network attack impossible; each attack must be assessed on its merits. It seems certain, however, that where a computer network attack causes destruction and fatalities on a par with a conventional attack, a state will have a right to respond in self-defence. This is the conclusion reached in a report by the Office of General Counsel of the US Department of Defense, which concluded:[22]\n[I]f a coordinated computer network attack shuts down a nation's air traffic control system along with its banking and financial systems and public utilities, and opens the floodgates of several dams resulting in general flooding that causes widespread civilian deaths and property damage, it may well be that no-one would challenge a victim nation if it concluded that it was the victim of an armed attack, or of an act equivalent to an armed attack.\nWhile undoubtedly correct, the report fails to separate and analyse the attack in its component parts, combining those components which directly cause death and destruction with less severe attacks. Schmitt focuses on the consequences of the attack rather than on the object of the attack or on the intentions of the attacker; the exception being where the intentions of the attacker are specifically to cause physical damage to tangible objects or injury to human beings, in which case Schmitt considers the resort to armed force is permitted.[23] He argues that self-defence should be limited to operations which are de facto armed attacks, or imminently preparatory thereto; the net result being a limitation on both sides to resort to computer network attack techniques which might threaten global stability and on individual responses which might themselves prove destabilising.[24]\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press ARMED ATTACK In contrast, Walter Sharp, one of the early authors on the subject, argues that any intrusion into systems containing information which is critical to the national security of the victim state should be considered an armed attack capable of triggering the right to respond with force.²⁵ This idea is premised on the notion that the features of modern society and its reliance on information systems are such that non-military means can often cause more harm than military ones.²⁶ However Sharp’s ‘strict liability’ approach has not been borne out by state practice, which to date has recognised such intrusions as simple espionage, an act not prohibited under international law.\nThe present author considers that the threshold for an armed attack conducted by computer network attack must be set in line with current international law regulating the right of self-defence. A state is therefore permitted to respond in self-defence when it is the victim of a computer network attack causing damage to property or persons of sufficient scale and effect to elevate it beyond the equivalent of a frontier incident. The denial of service attacks against Estonia in 2007, disruptive as they were, did not reach this level; neither did the attacks launched the following year against Georgia, although the analysis of that incident is complicated by the subsequent conventional attacks by Russia.²⁷ No loss of life, physical injury or destruction of property was suffered as a result of the computer network operations launched against either state. In contrast, the 2010 Stuxnet worm has purportedly resulted in significant destruction of property. At the time of writing, reports indicate that the worm may be responsible for Iran having to replace 1,000 of the 9,000 IR-1 centrifuges at the Natanz nuclear fuel enrichment facility. While reports of the effect of the worm on the facility and the resulting impact on Iran’s nuclear programme have differed wildly, a report by the Institute for Science and International Security detailing the effect of Stuxnet has concluded that while the effects of the worm were significant, the effect on Iran’s nuclear programme was only moderate:²⁸ ²⁵ Sharp, Cyberspace and the Use of Force, 129.\n²⁶ Ibid., 101–2.\n²⁷ The question of the cyber attacks acting as an indication of imminent armed attacks is addressed in the following section on anticipatory self-defence.\n²⁸ David Albright, Paul Brannan and Christina Walrond, Stuxnet Malware and Natanz: Update of ISIS December 22, 2010 Report, Institute for Science and International Security (2011) 3.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press ARMED ATTACK AND RESPONSE IN THE DIGITAL AGE While it has delayed the Iranian Centrifuge program at the Natanz plant in 2010 and contributed to slowing its expansion, it did not stop it or even delay the continued build up of [low enriched uranium] That being the case, it would appear that while the Stuxnet worm would undoubtedly amount to a use of force, the scale and effects of the attack do not appear to have sufficient gravity to amount to an armed attack.\n## 1.1. Anticipatory self-defence It is likely that computer network attacks will be used in conjunction with, or as a prelude to, a traditional armed attack. Such attacks designed to 'prepare the battle space' can come in a myriad of forms, including the disablement of intelligence-gathering sensors such as satellites and radar posts via computer network attack, disruption of military communications networks leaving units isolated and unable to be scrambled, or, on the civilian level, disablement of emergency response networks may be launched in anticipation of more traditional kinetic action to follow. It is certainly clear that states are considering how a combination of electronic and traditional attacks might be used in the future. For example, the US actively looked for computer network solutions prior to the 2003 invasion of Iraq and China is openly looking for an 'assassin's mace' to address the perceived asymmetry of the Chinese military against the US in conventional conflicts, widely believed to incorporate computer network attacks.²⁹ As Robertson points out, in modern warfare the electronic battlefield will play a crucial role, and any steps that a prospective attacker can take to neutralise or destroy its enemy's command and control, intelligence, communications, or weapons-control networks prior to a traditional attack would gain an enormous advantage.³⁰ This advantage was seen in the 2007 Israeli attack on the suspected Syrian nuclear site where the air defence radar did not detect the attacking planes until they were disappearing back over the border.³¹ One might also look to the role of the distributed denial of service attacks against Georgia in 2008 which preceded the physical invasion by Russia. While such attacks may not be sufficient ²⁹ David A. Fulghum, ‘Frustrations and Backlogs’, *Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology* 10, 10 March 2003, 33. According to reports these attempts were never put into action due to the interconnectedness of the target systems with foreign-owned networks.\n³⁰ Robertson, ‘Self-Defense against CNA’, 139.\n³¹ See Fulghum, Wall and Butler, ‘Israel Shows Electronic Prowess’.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press ARMED ATTACK to amount to an armed attack in and of themselves, as preparatory moves in a conventional attack they may be sufficient to justify the use of force under the doctrine of anticipatory self-defence.\n## 1.1.1. Doctrinal debate and imminent attacks There is no consensus in international legal doctrine over the point in time from which measures of self-defence against an armed attack may be taken.³² In particular, states and commentators are divided over whether a right of anticipatory self-defence exists in international law. The debate centres on whether anticipatory self-defence survived the implementation of Article 51 of the UN Charter, which states that nothing in the Charter ‘shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs’. Those arguing for a restrictive interpretation of the clause interpret this to mean that the right of self-defence is now only available to member states who are the object of an actual armed attack. Gray, Kelsen and Brownlie are some of the leading proponents of this view, which is based on the premise that the Charter forbids any use of force on the part of individual members except for the right of self-defence against an armed attack.³³ Those arguing for a more expansive approach point out that Article 51 specifically reserves the ‘inherent right’ of self-defence, and the customary right includes the right to respond to an imminent armed attack.³⁴ Although ultimately disagreeing with the position, Bothe points out that many authors acknowledge that a threat may be so direct and overwhelming that it is just not feasible to require the victim to wait to act in self-defence until the act has actually started.³⁵ Other authors have addressed this problem by adopting a broader notion ³² Randelzhofer, ‘Article 51’, 803.\n³³ Bowett, *Self-Defence*, 188. See also Brownlie, *Use of Force by States*, 275; Ian Brownlie, *International Law and the Use of Force by States: Revisited* (Europaeum, Oxford, 2001); Randelzhofer, ‘Article 51’, 803–4; Christine D. Gray, *International Law and the Use of Force* (3rd edn, Oxford University Press, 2008), 160; Dinstein, *War, Aggression, and Self-Defense*, 183.\n³⁴ Authors subscribing to this expansive view include Thomas M. Franck, *Recourse to Force: State Action against Threats and Armed Attacks* (Cambridge University Press, 2002), 97; Bowett, *Self-Defence*, 187–92; Christopher Greenwood, ‘International Law and the Pre-Emptive Use of Force: Afganistan, Al-Qaida, and Iraq’ (2003) 4 San Diego Int’l L.J. 7; Robert Y.

For example, while expressly rejecting the notion of anticipatory self-defence, Yoram Dinstein nevertheless incorporates actions taken in advance of an actual attack by moving the timing of the beginning of the attack, a concept he calls ‘interceptive’ self-defence.³⁶ Dinstein argues that the beginning of an armed attack is not linked to the first shot but rather to the moment of irrevocable commitment to the attack. Once the die has been cast, the armed attack can be said to have commenced and the victim state need not ‘wait impotently for the inescapable blow’.³⁷ This concept has echoes in the ‘target locking’ arguments of some states in respect of modern precision-guided missiles. For example, the US argues that an armed attack begins when the radar guiding the missile is locked on and ready to fire, and the rules of engagement of their armed forces reflect this approach.³⁸ Although, as Lindsay Moir points out, whether such an approach truly distinguishes between an armed attack which has begun but not yet reached the target state, and an armed attack that has not begun but is imminent, is open to question.³⁹ The standard to be applied for taking action in anticipation of an attack was set out by US Secretary of State Daniel Webster in his letter regarding the Caroline incident of 1837. In his now classic formulation, he stated that the right of self-defence only arises where there is ‘a necessity of self-defence, instant, overwhelming, leaving no choice of means, and no moment for deliberation’.⁴⁰ Christopher Greenwood ³⁶ Dinstein, War, Aggression, and Self-Defense, 187.\n³⁷ Dinstein, ‘CNA and Self-Defense’, 111.\n³⁸ Gray, Use of Force (2nd edn), 108, n. 48. For example, in 1998 US aircraft in the no-fly zone over Iraq fired at a missile battery when its radar had locked on to the planes patrolling the zone. Although there was controversy over whether the radar had locked on, the idea that the armed attack had started when the radar locked on was apparently accepted by Iraq and other states: Keesings (1998) 42368.\n³⁹ Lindsay Moir, Reappraising the Resort to Force: International Law, Jus Ad Bellum and the War on Terror (Hart, Oxford, 2010), 16.\n⁴⁰ In that incident, UK forces captured, fired and sent over the Niagara Falls a merchant vessel called the Caroline which was being used by Canadian rebels and their American forces in attacks against passing British ships. At the time of the UK attack the ship was moored in an American port and two US nationals were killed. One of the British officers, Lieutenant McLeod, was later arrested in the United States on charges of murder arising out of the incident. The British government, seeking McLeod’s release, maintained that its forces had acted in self-defence, to which US Secretary of State Daniel Webster replied in what has become the accepted statement of self-defence doctrine at the time. The Caroline Case (1837) 29 BFSP 1137-8.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press ARMED ATTACK points out that the Caroline test was applied by the international military tribunals at Nuremburg and Tokyo, suggesting that the right to respond in self-defence against imminent attacks was part of the customary law right preserved by Article 51 of the Charter.⁴¹ The preservation of an inherent right of self-defence and the existence of customary rights outside the Charter wording is also recognised by the Court in the Nicaragua (Merits) case, which noted that the Charter does not contain all the rules pertaining to self-defence, notably a definition of armed attack and the requirement of necessity and proportionality in any response.⁴² The Court expressly did not comment on the lawfulness of an anticipatory response to an imminent armed attack as it was not required on the facts of the case.⁴³ The Court’s approach in avoiding the difficult questions of self-defence and expressly stating no view on anticipatory self-defence has been followed in both the Wall and Armed Activities cases.⁴⁴ Two recent UN reports have not been so reluctant, however. The 2004 report of the UN Secretary-General’s High Level Panel concluded that there was an existing right of anticipatory self-defence against imminent attacks, basing their conclusion on customary international law.⁴⁵ Likewise the Report of the Secretary-General the following year expresses the view that responses to imminent threats are fully covered by Article 51 of the Charter.⁴⁶ ## 1.1.2. State practice The content of any customary right of anticipatory self-defence must be examined in light of state practice since the inception of the Charter. While state practice is far from conclusive on the matter, two instances in particular tend to indicate that the doctrine has survived. The first is the Israeli-Arab war of 1967. In the wake of escalating tensions between Syria and Israel, Egypt requested the removal of a United Nations emergency force from Egyptian territory, reinforced troops in the Sinai and dispatched troops to Jordan. Egyptian President Nasser also closed the Straits of Tiran to Israeli shipping (an act that Israel had ⁴¹ Greenwood, ‘Pre-Emptive Use of Force’, 13.\n⁴² Nicaragua (Merits), para. 176.\n⁴³ Ibid., para. 194.\n⁴⁴ The Wall Case; Armed Activities Case, para. 143.\n⁴⁵ United Nations, A More Secure World: Our Shared Responsibility.

A/59/2005 (2005) para. 124.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press ARMED ATTACK AND RESPONSE IN THE DIGITAL AGE previously made clear it would consider as an act of war) amid statements indicating his intention to eliminate Israel. In response to these actions Israel launched strikes against Egypt's airbases, completely destroying the Egyptian air force.⁴⁷ Israel justified its actions in the Security Council by claiming that it had been attacked first, but also by reference to a series of acts of sabotage from Syria, and stressed both the character of the Egyptian blockade as an act of war and ‘perhaps more imminent than anything else, this vast and purposeful encirclement movement’ caused by the transfer of large numbers of Egyptian forces to their ‘very gates’.⁴⁸ Gray rejects this incident as evidence of an acceptance of anticipatory self-defence, stating that ‘whatever position is taken on the facts of the outbreak of the Six Day War, the point of importance here is that Israel did not claim to be acting in anticipatory self-defence’.⁴⁹ However, Franck notes that Israel’s ‘words and actions clearly asserted a right of anticipatory self-defence against an imminent armed attack’.⁵⁰ In emphasising the fact that neither the Security Council nor the General Assembly condemned Israel’s actions, Franck comments:⁵¹ Most states, on the basis of the evidence available to them, did however conclude that such an armed attack was imminent, that Israel had reasonably surmised that it stood a better chance of survival if the attack were pre-empted, and that, therefore, in the circumstances, it had not acted unreasonably. This does not amount to an open-ended endorsement of a general right to anticipatory self-defense, but it does recognize that, in demonstrable circumstances of extreme necessity, anticipatory self-defense may be a legitimate exercise of a State’s right to ensure its survival.\nThis accords with the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice in the Nuclear Weapons case, which indirectly commented on the situation when the majority of judges were unable to conclude that the first use of nuclear weapons would invariably be unlawful if the very existence of the state were threatened.⁵² ⁴⁷ For a full exposition of the facts of this incident see generally A. Mark Weisburd, Use of Force: The Practice of States since World War II (Pennsylvania State University Press, 1997), 135.\n⁴⁸ UN SCOR, 1348th Meeting, 6 June 1967, UN Doc.

In most cases the reaction was based on a conclusion that Israel had failed to demonstrate that there was an imminent threat from Iraq and had thus failed to satisfy the Caroline requirements for anticipatory self-defence rather than a general dismissal of a right of anticipatory self-defence.54 As Greenwood points out, the emphasis on this failure to demonstrate the existence of the imminent threat tends, if anything, to confirm the existence of a right of self-defence in cases where such an imminent threat was shown to exist.55 He goes on to cite Rosalyn Higgins, who notes:56 [I]n a nuclear age, common sense cannot require one to interpret an ambiguous provision in a text in a way that requires a state passively to accept its fate before it can defend itself. And, even in the face of conventional warfare, this would also seem the only realistic interpretation of the contemporary right of self-defence. It is the potentially devastating consequences of prohibiting self-defence unless an armed attack has already occurred that leads one to prefer this interpretation – although it has to be said that, as a matter of simple construction of the words alone, another conclusion might be reached.\nIn assessing what will constitute an imminent attack, Greenwood argues that there are two additional factors which must be taken into account which did not exist at the time of the Caroline incident:57 The first is the gravity of the threat. The threat posed by a nuclear weapon, or a biological or chemical weapon, if used against a city, is so horrific that it is in a different league from the threats posed (as in the Caroline) by cross-border raids conducted by men armed only with rifles. Where the threat is an attack by weapons of mass destruction, the risk imposed upon a State by waiting until that attack actually takes place compounded by the impossibility for that State to afford its population any effective protection once the attack has been launched, mean that such an attack can reasonably be treated as imminent in circumstances where an attack by conventional means would not be so regarded. The second consideration is the method of delivery of the threat. It is far more difficult to determine the time scale within which a threat of https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press ARMED ATTACK AND RESPONSE IN THE DIGITAL AGE attack by terrorist means would materialize than it is with threats posed by, for example, regular armed forces. These would be material considerations in assessing whether, in any particular case, an attack should be treated as imminent.\nAlthough the existence of a right of anticipatory self-defence remains controversial, it is the view of the present author that a right of self-defence against an imminent attack is established in customary international law. The idea of computer network attacks as an indicator of an imminent attack is discussed in the following section.\n### 1.1.3. Computer network attacks and anticipatory self-defence There are two situations where anticipatory self-defence may be implicated in the information warfare context: first, where a computer network attack serves as an imminent threat of a conventional attack; and secondly, where electronic activity indicates a severe computer network attack (which rises to the level of an armed attack) is imminent.\nAs with any assessment of an imminent attack the context of a computer network attack must be taken into account. Where a computer network attack is launched as a precursor to conventional attack, the target will be important. If an attack targets early warning systems, radar posts or satellite feeds, military communications, or emergency response systems it is likely that a state will judge a traditional attack to be imminent. The Israeli attack against the Syrian air-defence network is a case in point. Had Syria become aware of the intrusion and manipulation of its air-defence radar prior to the attack, they would have been entitled to use force in response. Indeed most military forces would claim that the neutralisation of the air-defence network was the beginning of the attack itself, and would certainly be included under Dinstein’s interceptive self-defence analysis.\nThe disruption of electrical power grids or financial systems, on the other hand, is unlikely to be sufficiently indicative of a subsequent conventional attack when viewed in isolation. Thus when Estonia was subject to distributed denial of service attacks against its banking, media and governmental sites, there were no realistic fears that this signalled the beginning of a traditional armed attack. The additional variables, such as positive attribution to a particular actor and possible motivation, are too many and too varied. However, when such attacks are viewed in conjunction with other contextual indicators, states may be more likely to conclude that a conventional attack is imminent.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press ARMED ATTACK The 2008 conflict between Russia and Georgia over South Ossetia illustrates the dangers associated with such an attribution, however. That conflict took place in an atmosphere of increased tensions between the states and in the face of skirmishes between separatist forces and the Georgian military. Prior to the physical invasion, a series of distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks were launched against the Georgian government, and media targets and commentators have noted the close coordination between the targets of the computer network attacks in specific areas and the later physical strikes.58 While it is tempting to conclude that the computer network attacks were indicative of the imminent physical invasion, analysts agree that there is no link evident between the Russian government and the attacks, and that patriotic hackers were behind the electronic disruptions.59 Given the increasing frequency with which hacktivist groups launch such denial of service attacks to further their causes or protest political decisions, it seems unlikely that states will be able to rely on such attacks as indicators even, and perhaps especially, in times of increased political tension.\nThe second instance where a computer network attack may be evidence of an imminent armed attack is the use of computer network intrusions to prepare an electronic battlespace. Viruses, worms, Trojan horses and other forms of malware routinely infect unprotected computers with malicious code which may corrupt data, cause a malfunction, record keystrokes, disable virus protection and collect other information such as passwords and other access codes, feeding them back to a remote attacker. One of the most common features of these types of malware is some form of backdoor payload which allows the attacker to access and control the computer at a later date. Such malware is most often used to 'recruit' unprotected computers to vast networks of compromised computers called botnets. Usually used for spam or criminal enterprise, the controllers of the botnet can also use the command and control servers of the botnet to direct the sending of large amounts of traffic to particular IP addresses, bringing them, and https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press ARMED ATTACK AND RESPONSE IN THE DIGITAL AGE in some cases the transmission routes, to a standstill in a DDoS attack. Botnets have been utilised in most major DDoS attacks reported to date, including against Estonia in 2007 and Georgia in 2008.⁶⁰ The inclusion of backdoor payloads in malware raises interesting questions in relation to anticipatory self-defence.⁶¹ It is clear that a backdoor has no other purpose than to allow an intruder control over the infected computer (whether by direct intrusion or remote control) at a later date. A question which must then be addressed is whether a state has the right to respond in anticipatory self-defence against the perpetrators of a computer network attack with a backdoor payload. Although a backdoor can be used for attacks at any point until it is discovered and removed, and such attacks may have far more serious consequences, including those which would qualify as an armed attack, in most cases, the later use is to send spam or launch DDoS attacks causing inconvenience and only economic damage. Without further information about the purpose or target of any later attack, the mere creation of a backdoor by a state adversary is not indicative of the type or gravity of the attack to follow; indeed the creation of a backdoor may merely be evidence of espionage.⁶² Most importantly from a legal perspective, the existence of a backdoor would not meet the ‘imminent’ criteria for lawful self-defence, as the timescale for any subsequent attack is variable; the attack could be launched within days or years.\nOther network intrusions may more indicative, but they will be highly dependent on the circumstances. Two points deserve comment. First, the method of delivery means that there may be little warning of an impending computer network attack; this was one of Greenwood’s additional factors to be considered when determining whether an attack is imminent.⁶³ However, Greenwood’s second factor, the gravity of threat, will depend entirely on the individual threat; as pointed out in the previous chapter, one of the difficulties with assessing computer ⁶⁰ See, for example, Gadi Evron, ‘Battling Botnets and Online Mobs’ (2008) 9(1) GJIA 121, 124; Tikk, Kaska and Vihul, Cyber Incidents.\n⁶¹ A backdoor is a piece of code which opens a hidden or undocumented access point to the compromised computer or system, bypassing the authentication and security protocols and allowing remote access.\n⁶² Backdoors have been found on computers allegedly compromised by Chinese hackers.\n⁶³ Greenwood, ‘Pre-Emptive Use of Force’, 16.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press ARMED ATTACK\n\n## 1.1.4. The ‘Bush doctrine’ of pre-emptive self-defence65\nIn 2002 and 2006 the United States released two security strategy documents containing what appears to be a highly controversial attempt at enlarging the right to self-defence to include the use of force to preempt an attack which is merely threatened, but is not imminent. As Gray points out, there is some uncertainty as to the exact scope of the US claims; however, international criticism of the ‘Bush doctrine’ was both widespread and fierce.66 The 2002 National Security Strategy provided that:67\nWe must be prepared to stop rogue states and their terrorist clients before they are able to threaten or use weapons of mass destruction against the United States and our allies ...\n... Legal scholars and international jurists often conditioned the legitimacy of pre-emption on the existence of an imminent threat – most often a visible mobilization of armies, navies, and air forces preparing to attack.\nWe must adapt the concept of imminent threat to the capabilities and objectives of today’s adversaries ... The greater the threat, the greater is the risk of inaction – and the more compelling the case for taking anticipatory action to defend ourselves, even if uncertainty remains as to the time and place of the enemy’s attack. To forestall or prevent such hostile acts by our adversaries, the United States will, if necessary, act pre-emptively.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press ARMED ATTACK AND RESPONSE IN THE DIGITAL AGE The sentiments of the 2002 report are repeated in the National Security Strategy 2006.⁶⁸ While at first glance, this may appear to extrapolate logically based on the contingencies of modern weaponry, it compromises the basic premise of anticipatory self-defence laid down in the Caroline case and the evidence of state practice which has evolved the doctrine since. Greenwood has noted, far from removing the requirement of imminence ‘... practice also shows that the right of anticipatory self-defence is confined to instances where the armed attack is imminent’.⁶⁹ As noted above, while Greenwood accepts that the notion of imminence must take into account the gravity of the threat and its method of deliverance, he goes on to state: ‘In so far as talk of a doctrine of “pre-emption” is intended to refer to a broader right of self-defence to respond to threats that might materialize at some time in the future, such a doctrine has no basis in law.’⁷⁰ The issue has been debated extensively in the legal literature and will not be repeated here, save to say that state practice has not indicated widespread support for the doctrine, and both UN reports on security have rejected any wider right of pre-emptive self-defence, indicating it is for the Security Council to take pre-emptive action.⁷¹ In 2010 legal commentators watched with interest to see what the policy of the new US administration would be. However they were to be disappointed; while downplaying the idea of pre-emption, the Obama administration’s National Security Strategy 2010 does not dismiss it, merely stating that states must ‘adhere to standards that govern the use of force’ without elaborating further on what those standards might be.⁷² The relevance of this apparent ⁶⁸ White House, National Security Strategy of the United States of America (White House, 2006), 23. Although Gray notes the striking absence of any express reference to international law, the 2006 report does state that ‘the United States will, if necessary, act pre-emptively in exercising our inherent right of self-defense’, most likely an implicit reference to Art. 51 of the Charter: Christine D. Gray, ‘The Bush Doctrine Revisited: The 2006 National Security Strategy of the USA’ (2006) 5(3) Chi. J.

Pinprick attacks or accumulation of events theory Computer network attacks falling below the armed attack threshold may still trigger a forcible response by states. The most likely strategy utilising computer network attacks is to launch a swarm of lesser attacks, rather than a single large strike qualifying as an armed attack. In a short story published in 1998, John Arquilla detailed what a sustained cyber attack might look like:77 power blackouts, followed by weekly virus attacks of the magnitude of the Nimda, Slammer or Mydoom viruses, oil pipeline ruptures all launched within a matter of days of one another. While some of these attacks may cross the threshold of uses of force under Article 2(4), it is unlikely that any taken on their own would be considered an armed attack under current international law. An analogy may be drawn with cases of repeated cross-border incursions. States have claimed a right to act in self-defence https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press ARMED ATTACK AND RESPONSE IN THE DIGITAL AGE against a series of small-scale incursions or attacks as collectively amounting to a single armed attack. The ‘pinprick’ or ‘accumulation of events’ theory has been unsuccessfully argued in the past by several states, including the United Kingdom,⁷⁸ the United States,⁷⁹ South Africa and Israel,⁸⁰ in an attempt to justify actions purportedly taken in self-defence, that might otherwise be disproportionate. Although the Security Council rejected the claims by these states, each time it has done so on the specific facts of the case and on grounds that such actions were disproportionate. In each instance the condemnation by the Security Council suggested that the actions were unlawful reprisals, rather than commenting on the doctrinal issue of the scope of self-defence.⁸¹ Likewise, the International Court of Justice has avoided expressly discussing the issue, although it appears willing to contemplate the possibility of an accumulation of events amounting to an armed attack. The Court in the Nicaragua (Merits) case commented with regard to the incursions by Nicaragua into the territory of Honduras and Costa Rica:⁸² Very little information is available to the Court as to the circumstances of these incursions or to their possible motivations, which renders it difficult to decide whether they may be treated for legal purposes as amounting, singly or collectively, to an ‘armed attack’ by Nicaragua on either or both States.\n⁷⁸ In 1964 the Southern Arab Federation (SAF) which had military links with the United Kingdom, complained of an armed attack by the Yemen which consisted of a ‘series of aggressions’; invoking collective self-defence at the SAF’s request, the UK launched an air strike and destroyed a fort. The Security Council did not accept the reasoning and issued a statement condemning reprisals as ‘incompatible with the principles and purposes of the UN’. SC Res 188, 9 April 1964, as cited in Jean Combacau, ‘The Exception of Self Defence in U.N Practice’ in A. Cassese (ed.), The Current Legal Regulation of the Use of Force (Martinus Nijhoff, Dordrecht, 1986) 9–38, 27.\n⁷⁹ The US claimed it was acting in self-defence against alleged attacks by North Vietnamese naval vessels in the Gulf of Tonkin.

See ibid.\n⁸¹ Gray, Use of Force (3rd edn), 155.\n⁸² Nicaragua (Merits), para. 231. It should be noted that the Court found that there had not been an armed attack by Nicaragua based on additional circumstances.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press SELF-DEFENCE AGAINST NON-STATE ACTORS One final point should be noted: not all attacks which are launched from multiple computers will require a cumulative approach to qualify as an armed attack. A DDoS attack of sufficient scale and effect to elevate it above a ‘mere frontier incident’ would be considered a single attack as the attack originates from a single controller.⁸⁶ That is, although the attack appears to come from large numbers of computers in disparate locations, the compromised computers all receive their attack and targeting instructions via command and control servers manipulated from a single controlling ‘master’ which directs the botnet.⁸⁷ This is merely the electronic equivalent of an attack using more than one soldier, or a wave of bombers in an air strike.\n## 2. Self-defence against non-state actors One of the most difficult issues in contemporary jus ad bellum is the permitted response of states to attacks by non-state actors. The difficulty ⁸³ Case Concerning the Land and Maritime Boundary between Cameroon and Nigeria (Cameroon v. Nigeria: Equatorial Guinea Invervening) (2002) ICJ Reports, International Court of Justice, para. 323; Oil Platforms Case, para. 64; Armed Activities Case, para. 146.\n⁸⁴ Oil Platforms Case, para. 64.\n⁸⁵ See section 3, below.\n⁸⁶ For a detailed description of DDoS attacks, see Bennett Todd, Distributed Denial of Service Attacks (2000), www.linuxsecurity.com/resource_files/intrusion_detection/ddos-faq.html (last accessed 12 April 2011).\n⁸⁷ In traditional botnets this is generally through an Internet Relay Chat (IRC) Server. In newer peer-to-peer based botnets, such as the Storm worm, the controller publishes commands at specific keys in the network to be found by infected machines. However, the net result is the same.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press ARMED ATTACK AND RESPONSE IN THE DIGITAL AGE stems in part from the fact that Article 2(4) and Article 51 do not entirely correspond in their wording.⁸⁸ As has been noted above, Article 2(4) applies only in the international relations between states and thus does not apply to non-state actors; conversely, Article 51 refers to an inherent right of self-defence which is triggered ‘if an armed attack occurs’, with no mention of by whom the attack has been launched. Those arguing for a restricted right point to Article 51’s role as an exception to the prohibition contained in Article 2(4) to argue that it should likewise be constrained to armed attacks by states. Those, including the present author, who consider there is a broader right of self-defence point to state practice, the fact that Article 51 reflects an ‘inherent right’ rather than establishing one, and the recognition by the International Court of Justice in the Nicaragua (Merits) case that the Charter by no means reflects the whole of the body of law governing force.⁸⁹ As noted above, the International Court of Justice in its controversial decision in the Nicaragua (Merits) case, has addressed the issue of when a state might be held responsible for indirect military action by rebels acting ‘on behalf’ of a foreign state, establishing the test of ‘effective control’.⁹⁰ For computer network attacks, where attribution is one of the major problems, this test will prove particularly difficult to satisfy and commentators have been quick to point out the advantages that such plausible deniability will offer to sending states. However, the question of whether a state has a right to respond with force to an armed attack by a non-state actor absent a degree of state complicity has proved a far more difficult question, and one on which the International Court of Justice has been reluctant to comment. The issue has been covered extensively in recent legal literature, and it is not proposed to conduct a full survey of the arguments here, other than to note that there appears to be a divergence between the limited jurisprudence of the Court and emerging state practice on the issue.⁹¹ It is safe to say that the Court’s treatment of the matter has caused more confusion than clarification. In its advisory opinion on the Wall, in a statement described as both ‘opaque’ and ‘startling in its ⁸⁸ Moir, Resort to Force, 22.\n⁸⁹ For the latter point see Nicaragua (Merits), para. 176.\n⁹⁰ Although note also the alternate test established by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia in the Tadic case which specified an ‘effective control’ test.\n⁹¹ For a full discussion of the issues, see, for example, Gray, Use of Force (3rd edn); Moir, Resort to Force.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press SELF-DEFENCE AGAINST NON-STATE ACTORS Surveys of state practice, on the other hand, tend to suggest a much greater willingness on the part of the international community to accept the possibility of self-defence against armed attacks by non-state actors without attribution to a state.97 Moir notes, however, that a certain level of support and involvement on the part of the state is required, and is consistently asserted by states claiming the right.98 Thomas Franck suggests that measures taken in self-defence against non-state actors will be accepted by the international community where victim states have identified correctly the place from where it was attacked, that the authorities in that place deliberately, knowingly https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press ARMED ATTACK AND RESPONSE IN THE DIGITAL AGE or recklessly permitted the attack to occur, and that the victim state's response is proportionate.⁹⁹ For computer network attacks each of these factors raise additional issues. First, as discussed in section 3 below, correctly identifying and attributing an attack to a particular perpetrator in a timely manner is one of the most difficult problems in the field of computer network attacks, both from a technical standpoint and a legal one. To be able to do so in a manner that is clear and verifiable by the international community so as to back a claim for the legitimate exercise of self-defence will be an added level of difficulty. Second, even once computer forensics have established the origins of the attacks, proving a sufficient level of support and involvement by a state will be difficult. For example, the computer network attacks against Georgia demonstrated a high level of coordination between the cyber attacks launched by ‘patriotic hackers’ and the military operations carried out by Russia. Russia has denied any involvement with the attacks, and no evidence has been found of state organisations guiding or directing the attacks ‘be it because there was none, because the collection efforts were not far-reaching or deep enough to identify those connections, or because involvement by state organisations was conducted in a way to purposefully avoid attribution’.¹⁰⁰ There was certainly not enough to prove involvement of the Russian authorities in any official capacity,¹⁰¹ particularly absent the context of the military operations.¹⁰² In addition, states will find it very difficult to prevent or even be aware of computer network attacks emanating from their territory, particularly given the high prevalence of technologies such as proxy servers.\nThe final factor raised by Franck in determining whether the international community is likely to accept a claim by a state acting in self-defence against a non-state actor is the proportionality of the response. The question of proportionality is discussed in section 4 below; however, there are a few issues which pertain specifically to non-state actors. First, states have been quick to condemn actions ⁹⁹ Franck, Recourse to Force, 68.\n¹⁰⁰ Project Grey Goose, Phase I Report, 3.\n¹⁰¹ Some investigators provided circumstantial evidence of possible involvement by individual officials within the Russian administration; however, many experts remain sceptical of these claims. See generally Tikk, Kaska and Vihul, Cyber Incidents, 74–6.\n¹⁰² It will be recalled that the computer network attacks began prior to the physical invasion and continued after the ceasefire.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press ATTRIBUTION purportedly taken in self-defence which have targeted the infrastructure of the host state.¹⁰³ Given that most computer network attacks by non-state actors utilise this infrastructure, it may prove difficult for victim states to find an acceptable target. Secondly, the dispersed nature of many computer network attacks means that the non-state actors responsible for the attack may be resident in several different host states, complicating the proportionality assessment of any forcible response. It should be noted, however, that the most obvious example of such a dispersed attack, the DDoS attack, would rarely rise to the level of gravity required for an armed attack, absent involvement in a wider programme of attacks that could be responded to under the doctrine of accumulation of events.\nOne final point deserves comment: computer network attacks may also provide a unique opportunity for states to take action against non-state actors without violating the territorial integrity of the state from which they are acting; however, non-state actors are less likely to have infrastructure that would provide viable targets for forcible computer network attacks.¹⁰⁴ # 3. Attribution One of the major problems with any computer network attack is the attribution of the attack to a particular actor. While the origin of some attacks becomes immediately evident, either because the attacker identifies themselves,¹⁰⁵ or because they precede traditional attacks that are easily attributed to a particular source,¹⁰⁶ other attacks will be launched anonymously. Given the common use of botnets and the frequency of IP spoofing that takes place in computer network attacks,¹⁰⁷ ¹⁰³ See, for example, the international condemnation of the Israeli attacks against Lebanon in 2006 in response to attacks by Hezbollah, and also the comment of the ICJ in the Armed Activities case that the taking of airports and towns many kilometres away from the site of the series of transborder attacks complained of did not seem proportionate: Armed Activities Case, para. 147.\n¹⁰⁴ See, for example, the opinion of Judge Higgins in the Wall case, dissenting on the grounds that non-forcible measures such as the construction of a wall do not really fall within the concept of self-defence.\n¹⁰⁵ For example, the 'I Love You' virus source code contained the 'signature' of the author.\n¹⁰⁶ For example, the Israeli attack on the Syrian air-defences in advance of an air strike.\n¹⁰⁷ IP spoofing essentially forges the data identifying the sending computer in the header of a data packet so that it appears to originate from a different IP address, thus any response is sent to the forged computer.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press ARMED ATTACK AND RESPONSE IN THE DIGITAL AGE it is difficult to state with any certainty that the entity that appears to be the perpetrator of the attack is in fact the ultimate attacker.\nIP spoofing can be used either to simply mask the origin of an attack, or in a deliberate attempt to place the blame for an attack on another party. An early example of the latter problem occurred in 1999 when a denial of service attack was launched against the US Department of Transport. The attack appeared to emanate from a server in Maryland run by followers of the Falun Gong movement; in fact, the attack was designed to take down both the Maryland server and the Department of Transport network server, leaving the Falun Gong bearing the blame. However, the attackers had blundered and the attack was traced to a computer located at the address of China's Ministry of Public Security. No information is publicly available regarding the US response to this attack; however, in 2002 Richard Clarke, then White House technology advisor, stated before a Senate Judiciary subcommittee hearing on cyber terrorism that the government had never been able to prove to their satisfaction that a particular government was responsible for a specific unauthorised intrusion.[108] The proliferation of botnets also makes attribution difficult. As the 2007 denial of service attacks against Estonia proved, it can be very difficult to differentiate between attacks that originate from a particular address and those which are merely utilising a compromised computer. Although some of the IP addresses involved in the attacks against Estonia were traced to official IP addresses of Russian state authorities, Russia denied any involvement and claimed that these computers had been compromised and were being manipulated from outside the Kremlin. Subsequent reports by cyber security analysts tend to back this claim, pointing to the lack of evidence and also noting the possibility of spoofing the IP address of the attacker.[109] Of course, problems of attribution aren't restricted to cyberspace. Armed attacks following more conventional patterns are often carried out anonymously, or responsibility is claimed by armed groups which appear unlikely to have the resources required for such an attack. Further, in the case of state-sponsored terrorism, it is unlikely that any state will step forward to take responsibility for kinetic acts, let alone electronic ones. Those factors aside, a victim state must still establish https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press ATTRIBUTION a link between the attacking group and the sponsoring state, the same approach must be taken with electronic attacks.¹¹⁰ This may be particularly difficult to prove where attacks are launched by groups or loose affiliations of individuals in conjunction with traditional state action. For example, when Russia moved troops into South Ossetia following the Georgian offensive in 2008, the air strikes and ground forces were accompanied by a series of computer network attacks against Georgian servers. While these attacks were certainly not serious enough to amount to armed attacks, given Georgia's limited internet connectivity, they illustrate the capacity for other actors to effectively 'join-in' a conflict with or without state authorisation. Several security analysts reported botnets allegedly controlled by the Russian Business Network, a group known to be linked to cyber crime, launching denial of service attacks at Georgian servers. However, software was also freely available for download to individual computers from Russian language websites such as 'stopgeorgia.ru' along with a list of targets, making joining the cyber offensive as simple as a few mouse clicks.¹¹¹ As noted previously, the Russian government denies any involvement with the attacks;¹¹² however, the issue raises the difficult question of state responsibility for non-state actors and the necessity or degree of state involvement or complicity required before force can be used in self-defence against the state. This book does not address this issue in depth; suffice it to note that there is little agreement in the international community on the issue in relation to conventional attacks, let alone computer network attacks.¹¹³ However, it is clear that a state must not knowingly allow its territory to be used as a sanctuary for terrorists or armed bands bent on attacking military targets or civilian objects in another country.¹¹⁴ The difficulty of attribution also affects the victim state's ability to engage in forcible countermeasures in self-defence.¹¹⁵ The Court in the ¹¹⁰ Dinstein, 'CNA and Self-Defense', 112.\n¹¹¹ John Markoff, 'Before the Gunfire, Cyberattacks', New York Times, 13 August 2008; Evgeny Morozov, 'An Army of Ones and Zeroes: How I Became a Soldier in the Georgia-Russia Cyberwar', Slate, 14 August 2008, www.slate.com/id/2197514/ (last accessed 12 April 2011).\n¹¹² Siobhan Gorman, 'Georgia States Computers Hit by Cyberattack', Wall Street Journal (New York), 12 August 2008, A9.\n¹¹³ For a discussion of legal attribution and state responsibility for non-state actors' use of force see generally Gray, Use of Force (2nd edn).\n¹¹⁴ Ian Brownlie, 'International Law and the Activities of Armed Bands' (1958) 7 International and Comparative Law Quarterly 712, 734, cited in Dinstein, War, Aggression, and Self-Defense, 206.\n¹¹⁵ Sharp, Cyberspace and the Use of Force, 133, cited in Dinstein, 'CNA and Self-Defense', 111.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press ARMED ATTACK AND RESPONSE IN THE DIGITAL AGE Oil Platforms case held that the burden of proof rests on the state invoking the right of self-defence and that the United States had failed to prove that it had been subject to an armed attack by a particular state, vis Iran.¹¹⁶ ‘[A victim state] must not rush headlong into hasty action predicated on reflexive impulses and unfounded suspicions; it has no choice but to withhold forcible response until hard evidence is collated and the state of affairs is clarified, lest the innocent be endangered.’¹¹⁷ Such hasty reactions could lead to the escalation of hostilities, something the ban on force was intended to prevent. However, the necessity of waiting for hard evidence of responsibility also opens the possibility that any action taken against a perpetrator once responsibility has been confirmed will be classified as an armed reprisal rather than an action taken in self-defence. Armed reprisals are prohibited under international law.¹¹⁸ ## 4. Necessity and proportionality All responses to attacks, whether their means of delivery are kinetic or electronic, are subject to the underlying principles of necessity and proportionality. The International Court of Justice has repeatedly confirmed that self-defence, whether individual or collective, warrants only those measures which are ‘proportional to the armed attack and necessary to respond to it’ as a principle well established in customary international law.¹¹⁹ The principles are not stated in UN Charter but are often traced back to the Webster formulation in the Caroline incident.¹²⁰ The principle of necessity requires that any measures taken avowedly in self-defence must have been necessary for that purpose; the principle is strict and objective ‘leaving no room for any measure of discretion’.¹²¹ That is, it is not sufficient that force is used after an armed attack; it must be necessary to repel that attack,¹²² and non-forcible remedies must either prove futile in limine or have in fact been exhausted in an ¹¹⁶ Oil Platforms Case, paras 57, 61.\n¹¹⁷ Dinstein, ‘CNA and Self-Defense’, 111.\n¹¹⁸ Declaration on Friendly Relations, Principle on the Use of Force, para. 6.\n¹¹⁹ Nicaragua (Merits), paras 176 and 194; Nuclear Weapons Case, para. 41; Oil Platforms Case, para. 74; Armed Activities Case, para. 147.\n¹²⁰ There must be ‘a necessity of defence, instant, overwhelming, leaving no choice of means and no moment for deliberation’.\n¹²¹ Oil Platforms Case, para. 73.\n¹²² Greenwood, ‘Pre-Emptive Use of Force’, 23.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press NECESSITY AND PROPORTIONALITY The principle of necessity also gives rise to a related principle, namely that actions taken in self-defence must generally be taken without undue delay.¹²⁶ In the case of computer network attacks, this may make successful claims of self-defence more difficult. Where the origins of a computer network attack are not obvious, the time taken to conduct computer forensics and establish hard evidence of the identity of the perpetrator may militate against a finding that any subsequent action by the victim state is in self-defence. Similar criticisms were levelled at the United States after a delay of several weeks between the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon and subsequent action in Afghanistan.¹²⁷ Likewise, the Court in the *Nicaragua (Merits)* case also criticised the US for commencing activities purportedly in self-defence several months after the major offensive of the opposition against the government of El Salvador had been completely repulsed, although ultimately dismissing the claim of self-defence on other grounds.¹²⁸ However, Dinstein notes that this requirement must not be construed too strictly; he points to the delay of approximately five months between the invasion of Kuwait and the authorisation of all necessary means by the Security Council.¹²⁹ The principle of proportionality requires the weighing of the response against its permitted purpose of halting and repelling the attack, or, in the case of anticipatory self-defence, preventing it from ¹²³ Dinstein, ‘CNA and Self-Defense’, 109.\n¹²⁴ Roberto Ago, ‘Addendum to the Eighth Report on State Responsibility’ (1980) II UN Y.B.

Whether or not an act is proportionate will necessarily be dependent on the facts of the situation; however, the action must not be retaliatory or punitive, its lawfulness cannot be measured ‘except by its capacity for achieving the desired result’.¹³⁰ This raises an interesting question with respect to computer network attacks; namely whether it would ever be proportionate to use traditional armed force against an electronic attack. The answer must surely be in the affirmative. Proportionality does not restrict the defending state to the same weapons or the same numbers of armed forces as the attacking state; nor is it necessarily limited to action on its own territory.¹³¹ Therefore it would be open to the victim of a computer network attack to use whatever weapons it has at its disposal to repel the attack, as long as the response is proportionate to that purpose. As Ago notes:¹³² In the case of self-defence, it was essential to avoid the error of thinking that there should be some proportionality between the action of the aggressor and the action of the state defending itself. Proportionality could be judged only in terms of the objective of the action, which was to repel an attack and prevent it from succeeding. No limitations that might prejudice the success of a response to attack could be placed on the State suffering the attack. The concept of reasonable action must of course enter into the matter, since self-defence could not justify a genuine act of aggression committed in response to an armed attack of limited proportions.\nThus, if a computer network attack is being used to prepare the battlespace for a conventional attack, the use of military force in response must be proportionate in relation to the need to repel the attack as a whole. However, it should be noted that while physically bombing the attacking computers and their owners may be legal, it is not necessarily the preferred method of response.¹³³ Only a few examples of state intrusion have been made public to date, and no large-scale attacks as would justify a forcible response have been reported. Further, state practice in response to electronic probes emanating from other states have not resulted in forcible responses.¹³⁴ ¹³⁰ Ago, ‘Addendum’, 69 para. 121.\n¹³¹ Gray, *Use of Force* (3rd edn), 150.\n¹³² Roberto Ago, ‘State Responsibility’ (1980) Vol. 1 *UN Y.B.

Countermeasures against unlawful acts\nWhere a computer network attack does not rise to the level of an armed attack, a state may still respond with proportionate countermeasures. However, where forcible countermeasures are taken in response to an ordinary breach of international law, not constituting an armed attack, they are unlawful.¹³⁶\nHowever, an alternate line of reasoning, arising out of the controversial gap theory put forward by the majority of the International Court of Justice in the Nicaragua (Merits) decision, appears to have muddied the waters somewhat. The Court held that acts committed by Nicaragua against El Salvador, Honduras and Costa Rica amounted to less grave forms of ‘illegal military intervention’.¹³⁷ The Court held that that ‘proportionate counter-measures’ were permissible on the part of the victim state; however, they did not create any entitlement by any third state to take collective countermeasures involving the use\nHezbollah telecommunications network. The response was condemned by states; however, given the non-international nature of the dispute, it does not provide any useful indication of state practice in this regard. See generally ‘Hezbollah Takes over West Beirut’, BBC News, 9 May 2008, http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/7391600.stm (last accessed 15 July 2011).\n¹³⁵ Jensen, ‘Computer Attacks’, 231.\n¹³⁶ Dinstein, War, Aggression, and Self-Defense, 226.\n¹³⁷ The Court held that Nicaragua did supply aid to rebels in the territories of El Salvador, but had insufficient evidence of the nature, scale and continuance of such aid. The Court further held that Nicaragua was responsible for certain transborder military incursions into Honduras and Costa Rica.

Either the Court was saying:¹³⁹\n(a) that there are some acts of force that nobody, not even the victim, may resist by proportionate measures of force; or it was saying (b) that the victim may resist with force provided that it does so alone. There is little to be said in explanation of the latter proposition other than it is simply a[n] ... arbitrary announcement of the Court.\nHargrove argues that allowing forcible countermeasures ‘would in one remarkable stroke manage both to impair the right of self-defense, and to weaken fundamentally the prohibition on the use of force by creating an open-ended and wholly new category of exceptions to Article 2(4) of the Charter, of unknown content and limit.’¹⁴⁰ However, Judge Simma in his separate opinion in the *Oil Platforms* case has argued that the Court in the *Nicaragua (Merits)* case cannot, in the context of that case, have understood that to mean mere pacific reprisals.¹⁴¹ He argues that the Court can only have meant ‘defensive military action “short of” full-scale self-defence’.¹⁴²\nBut we may encounter also a lower level of hostile military action, not reaching the threshold of an ‘armed attack’ within the meaning of Article 51 of the United Nations Charter. Against such hostile acts, a state may of course defend itself, but only within a more limited range and quality of responses (the main difference being that the possibility of collective self-defence does not arise, cf. *Nicaragua*) and bound to necessity, proportionality and immediacy in time in a particularly strict way.\nSimma’s treatment of the conditions in respect of forcible countermeasures is clearly linked to the classic self-defence analysis, rather\n¹³⁸ ‘[A] use of force of a lesser degree of gravity cannot ... produce any entitlement to take collective counter-measures involving the use of force. The acts of which Nicaragua is accused ... could only have justified proportionate counter-measures on the part of the state which had been the victim of these acts, namely El Salvador, Honduras or Costa Rica. They could not justify counter-measures taken by a third state, the United States, and particularly could not justify intervention involving the use of force.’ *Ibid.*, para. 249.\n¹³⁹ Hargrove, *Nicaragua Judgement*, 141.\n¹⁴⁰ *Ibid.*, 142.\n¹⁴¹ *Oil Platforms Case* (per Judge Simma), para. 12.\n¹⁴² *Ibid.*, per Judge Simma, paras 12–13.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCOUNTERMEASURES AGAINST UNLAWFUL ACTS\n\nWhere a computer network attack does not amount to an armed attack (or a use of force), any countermeasures taken by the victim state will be conditional on, and limited by, the law relating to countermeasures.¹⁴³ In the Case Concerning the Gabcikovo-Nagymaros Project, the International Court of Justice set out a three-part test justifying proportionate countermeasures. First, the action must be taken in response to an internationally wrongful act of another state and be directed against that state. Second, the victim state must have called upon the offending state to discontinue its wrongful conduct or to make reparation for it. And finally, the effects of the countermeasure must be commensurate with the injury suffered, taking account of the rights in question.¹⁴⁴ In this regard the test for proportionality differs between countermeasures and self-defence, where the response must be proportional to the threat, rather than the actual harm suffered. However, the Court also stated that the purpose of the countermeasures must be to induce the wrongdoing state to comply with its obligations under international law, and that the measure must therefore be reversible.¹⁴⁵ In respect of a computer network attack this would seem to fit with current state practice; most attacks to date have merely resulted in states requesting the alleged perpetrator of the attack to cease their actions.¹⁴⁶ However, the nature of computer network attacks, including the type of attacks they make possible and, most importantly, their ability to be reversed, makes computer network attacks particularly useful as a countermeasure against a previous wrongful act of a state. For example, a series ¹⁴³ See generally United Nations, International Law Commission and James Crawford, The International Law Commission's Articles on State Responsibility: Introduction, Text, and Commentaries (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, New York, 2002).\n¹⁴⁴ Case Concerning the Gabcikovo-Nagymaros Project (1997) ICJ Reports 3, International Court of Justice, para. 85.\n¹⁴⁵ Ibid., para. 87.\n¹⁴⁶ Although it should be noted that in all reported cases to date the suspected perpetrator has denied any involvement with the attack.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press ARMED ATTACK AND RESPONSE IN THE DIGITAL AGE of blackouts in response to an internationally wrongful act may be a useful coercive measure.\nThe 1998 Zapatista ‘Floodnet’ attacks on the Pentagon’s website by the Electronic Disturbance Theatre also provide a model for how electronic countermeasures might work against non-state actors. US Department of Defense specialists created a program that would recognise the Floodnet applet installed on computers trying to access the Department of Defense website.¹⁴⁷ Once the applet was identified, a program was sent back to the activist’s computer to shut down their web browser, thus ending the attack.¹⁴⁸ Although criticisms were levelled at the Department for not thoroughly considering the legal ramifications of such a response,¹⁴⁹ the United States’ decision to respond electronically, in this instance, against an attack which they had been expecting, must be considered a proportionate countermeasure, particularly against a demonstrably non-violent protest group. There was some speculation that this approach was being renewed by the US Department of Defense in its ‘active defence’ policy released in 2011;¹⁵⁰ statements made by Lynn prior to release of the policy indicated that the US intended to stop threats before they reached Department of Defense networks. However, the unclassified version of the Pentagon’s cyber-security strategy appears to focus the concept of active defence on network speed hunting for malicious activity within Department of Defense networks and systems, rather than pushing back beyond the network boundaries.¹⁵¹ The danger with adopting the push-back approach against states is the risk of escalation of such countermeasures into forcible responses, a situation which the Security Council would be likely to determine a threat to international peace and security, as seen in the following section.\n¹⁴⁷ An applet is a small piece of code designed to perform one specific task within another application.\n¹⁴⁸ Brian Friel, ‘DoD Launches Internet Counterattack’, Government Executive, 18 September 1998, http://govexec.com/dailyfed/0998/091898b1.htm (last accessed 12 April 2011).\n¹⁴⁹ George I.

The Security Council has ‘primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security’ and may recommend or authorise member states to engage in measures, which may include the use of force, in order to pursue this aim. Article 39 provides: The Security Council shall determine the existence of any threat to the peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression and shall make recommendations, or decide what measures shall be taken in accordance with Articles 41 and 42, to maintain or restore international peace and security.\nThis raises two separate issues for the use of computer network attacks. First, when will the Security Council consider computer network attacks to be a ‘threat to the peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression’; and second, under what circumstances might measures authorised by the Security Council under Chapter VII include computer network attacks?\nAs noted, prior to the Security Council recommending action, it must determine that a ‘threat to the peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression’ exists under Article 39. In practice, the Council has almost exclusively exercised its powers by finding a ‘threat to international peace and security’, even in situations where a breach of the peace or act of aggression is obvious;¹⁵² thus the analysis will concentrate on this broader standard. Whether or not there are any limits on the Security Council’s ability to determine a threat to the peace is the subject of debate amongst legal scholars;¹⁵³ however, it is generally accepted that the Council possesses considerable discretion in this respect. The resulting range of situations in which the Security Council has found a threat to the peace is increasingly broad and includes the danger of violent countermeasures by states to violations of international law, regardless of their admissibility.¹⁵⁴ The Council has also ¹⁵² Jochen Frowein, ‘Article 39’ in B. Simma (ed.), The Charter of the United Nations: A Commentary (2nd edn, Oxford University Press, 2002) 717, 722; Gray, Use of Force (3rd edn), 256. All instances in which the Security Council has found an act of aggression or breach of the peace have involved inter-state conflicts.\n¹⁵³ See generally Erika De Wet, The Chapter VII Powers of the United Nations Security Council (Hart, Oxford, 2004), 133-4.\n¹⁵⁴ Frowein, ‘Article 39’, 722.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press ARMED ATTACK AND RESPONSE IN THE DIGITAL AGE found threats to the peace in internal conflicts such as those in Liberia, Rwanda, Sierra Leone and East Timor;[155] violations of human rights and humanitarian law in Somalia, Rwanda and Eastern Zaire;[156] violations of democratic principles in Haiti and Sierra Leone;[157] terrorism;[158] nuclear proliferation and even failure to cooperate with international prosecutions.[159] These examples illustrate the broad discretion that the Security Council has to determine that a threat to the peace exists; however, Frowein has argued that this does not mean that the notion of a threat to the peace has become limitless. He argues that a threat to the peace exists when, in a particular situation, a danger of the use of force on a considerable scale arises.[160] Although the Security Council has not considered any computer network attacks to date,[161] based on this assessment it would certainly appear that a computer network attack would constitute a threat to the peace where it is of sufficient gravity that a state is likely to respond to it with force, regardless of whether it is categorised as an armed attack, or where the type of attack indicates further violence to follow, whether electronically or by kinetic means.\nOnce the Security Council has determined a threat to the peace, the Council may make recommendations, or require states to take action under Articles 40, 41 and 42 of the Charter, for the restoration or maintenance of international peace and security. Interestingly, once the Security Council has deemed a situation a threat to the peace, it 'is free to take measures against any entity which it considers to be an obstructive factor in the restoration of peace'.[162] Thus, having determined the https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press SECURITY COUNCIL AUTHORISATION AND COLLECTIVE MEASURES Article 40 allows the Security Council to establish any provisional measures it deems necessary or desirable to prevent an aggravation of the situation, before deciding what recommendations to make under Article 39. Provisional measures are made without prejudice to the rights, claims or position of the parties, but failure to comply with them will be taken into account by the Security Council.\nArticle 41 allows the Security Council to decide: [W]hat measures not involving the use of armed force are to be employed to give effect to its decisions, and it may call upon the Members of the United Nations to apply such measures. These may include complete or partial interruption of economic relations and of rail, sea, air, postal, telegraphic, radio, and other means of communication, and the severance of diplomatic relations. (emphasis added) This would also allow for the disruption of individual internet access, such as that demonstrated by the United States in response to the 1998 attack by the Electronic Disturbance Theatre, and may also allow for the total disconnection of a country from the internet by a third party, in the same manner as the self-imposed internet blackouts attempted internally by regimes in Egypt, Myanmar and Libya.¹⁶⁴ Some attempts have been made to argue that such a measure would be the electronic equivalent of a blockade (which would fall within the forceful measures provided for in Article 42);¹⁶⁵ however, the present author does not consider that this is an appropriate classification, despite the ¹⁶³ SC Res 1127, 1997, cited in ibid.\n¹⁶⁴ James Cowie, ‘What Libya Learned from Egypt’, *Renesys Blog*, 5 March 2011, www.renesys.com/blog/2011/03/what-libya-learned-from-egypt.shtml (last accessed 12 April 2011); Jordan Robertson, ‘The Day Part of the Internet Died: Egypt Goes Dark’, *The Washington Times* 28 January 2011, www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/jan/28/day-part-internet-died-egypt-goes-dark/ (last accessed 12 April 2011); OpenNet Initiative, *Pulling the Plug: A Technical Review of the Internet Shutdown in Burma*, OpenNet Initiative (2007), http://opennet.net/sites/opennet.net/files/ONI_Bulletin_Burma_2007.pdf (last accessed 12 April 2011).\n¹⁶⁵ See media reports following both the Estonian and Georgian denial of service attacks.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press ARMED ATTACK AND RESPONSE IN THE DIGITAL AGE severe economic effects that this would undoubtedly have on highly technologically dependent states.¹⁶⁶ Electronic measures under Article 41 could arguably also encompass denial of service attacks launched against the media, banking and telecommunications infrastructure of a state, although the shaping of the response to the threat may prove difficult in practice.\nWhere non-forceful measures have been unsuccessful, or if the Security Council determines that such measures would be inadequate, the Council may authorise action under Article 42 by such air, sea or land forces as may be necessary to maintain or restore international peace and security; examples include demonstrations, blockade and other operations by air, sea or land forces of Members of the United Nations.¹⁶⁷ It appears unlikely that the Security Council would consider it necessary to authorise force against a computer network attack; however, where an attack or ongoing series of attacks cannot be prevented or stopped by electronic means, it is within their purview to do so. As noted earlier, force is not necessarily the preferred means of countering a cyber attack because of the distributed nature of many methods of attack.\nA more interesting scenario is the possibility of the Security Council authorising computer network attacks of sufficient gravity to amount to a use of force in response to a threat to the peace. For example, in the past few years the Security Council has passed a series of resolutions expressing its concern over the proliferation risks presented by the Iranian nuclear programme.¹⁶⁸ Although the Council has not explicitly stated that it considers that the programme represents a threat to international peace and security, this is far from unusual; it is clear from the practice of the Council that no formal pronouncement with an express reference to Article 39 is necessary; the use of the language is apparently sufficient.¹⁶⁹ The Council does, however, explicitly state that it is acting under Article 41 of Chapter VII of the Charter, and each resolution calls for member states to implement a series of specific non-forceful measures against Iran. The author has previously concluded that the Stuxnet worm amounts to a use of force as it is ¹⁶⁶ For example, the OECD estimates the economic impact of shutting down internet and mobile phone services in Egypt for five days in 2011 at US$90 million in direct costs alone.\n¹⁶⁷ Art. 42, UN Charter.\n¹⁶⁸ SC Res 1929 (2010); SC Res 1803 (2008); SC Res 1747 (2007); SC Res 1737 (2006).\n¹⁶⁹ Gray, Use of Force (3rd edn), 256.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press CONCLUSION\n\n## 7. Conclusion\nAs with the discussion in the previous chapter relating to the use of force, the classification of computer network attacks as armed attacks sits on top of a deep doctrinal divide between those who would argue for a wide interpretation of the right to self-defence and those who would restrict it. The present author believes that in regard to computer network attacks, a restrictive view of the armed attack threshold and the subsequent right to self-defence is preferable. Classification of computer network attacks which would amount to armed attacks should therefore be restricted to those attacks which cause physical damage to property or persons of a sufficient scale and effect. Given the particular difficulties and length of time involved in accurately attributing attacks and the fact that states acting in self-defence are not restricted to responding in kind, the danger of computer network attacks escalating into traditional conflict is apparent. That is not to say that states cannot respond to computer network attacks that do not rise to the level of an armed attack; a state may still respond with proportionate countermeasures or appeal to the Security Council for a finding that the attacks amount to a threat to the peace.\n¹⁷⁰ Thus even if Stuxnet had not resulted in physical damage but merely stopped the enrichment facility from working it could not have fallen within the terms of the Security Council authorisations.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511894527.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press"
