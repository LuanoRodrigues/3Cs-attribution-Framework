Introduction\nIntensive development of information and communication technologies and their wide use in all spheres of human activity have accelerated post-industrial development and the building of a global information society, becoming a driving force for social development. The global information infrastructure provides unprecedented opportunities for communication among people, their socialization and access to information. Individuals, societies and states depend on the stability and reliability of the information infrastructure.\nComputers and computer networks have become increasingly integral to government, military, and civilian functions. They allow instant communication and provide platforms on which business and government alike can operate. Computers now control both military and civilian infrastructures, including nuclear arsenals, telecommunication networks, electrical power systems, water supplies, oil storage facilities, financial systems, and emergency services.\nAs the worldwide explosion of information technology (IT) is changing the ways that business, government, and education are conducted, it also promises to change the way wars are waged. The development of information technology makes it possible for adversaries to attack each other in new ways and to inflict new forms of damage, and may create new targets for attack. Attackers may use international networks to damage or disrupt enemy systems, without ever physically entering the enemy's country.\nInformation technologies enable a fundamentally new and effective means to disrupt or destroy a country's industry, its economy, social infrastructure and public administration. They have the potential to be a means of combat capable of achieving goals related to inter-state confrontation at the tactical, operational and strategic levels. Whatever the development and diffusion of information technology mean for the future of warfare, it is apparent that many of the new forms of attack that information technology enables are qualitatively different from prior forms of attack. The use of such tools as computer intrusion and computer viruses, for example, take war out of the physical, kinetic\n200\nAlexandru Nitu\nworld and bring it into an intangible, electronic one. Effects previously attainable only through physical destruction are now accomplished remotely with the silent means of information technology.\nThese new ways of fighting have been labeled Information Warfare (IW). Definitions and conceptions of IW are numerous, but generally entail preserving one's own information and information technology while exploiting, disrupting, or denying the use of an adversary's (Shackelford 2009). In US military doctrine, IW it is part of a much larger strategic shift that was named Information Operations (IO). Information Operations involve actions taken to affect adversary information and information systems while defending one's own information and information systems. Information Operations apply across all phases of an operation, throughout the range of military operations, and at every level of war. Information Warfare is Information Operations conducted during time of crisis or conflict, including war, to achieve or promote specific objectives over a specific adversary or adversaries (Joint Chiefs of Staff 1998).\nThe new emerging vulnerabilities that information age generates are more likely to be exploited by opponents of developed states that cannot hope to prevail on the battlefield, or even at the negotiations table. A lesser-advantaged state hoping to seriously harm a dominant adversary must inevitably compete asymmetrically. It must seek to counter the strengths of the opponent not head-on, but rather employing unorthodox means to strike at centers of gravity.\nIW offers such asymmetrical benefits. In the first place, in many cases a computer network attack will either not merit a response involving the use of force, or the legality of such a response could be debatable, even if the victim is able to accurately identify the attack and its source. Thus, because of the potentially grave impact of cyber attacks on a state's infrastructure, it can prove a high gain, low risk option for a state outclassed militarily or economically. Moreover, to the extent that an opponent is militarily and economically advantaged, it is probably technologically dependent, and, therefore, teeming with tempting targets.\n## 2. IW and the 'use of force' concept\nSeveral rules govern when force can be used (the jus ad bellum, which focuses on the criteria for going to war, covering issues such as right purpose, duly constituted authority, last resort) and how states can use that force in an armed conflict (the jus in bello or 'law of war', that creates the concept of just war-fighting, covering discrimination, proportionality, humanity etc). These rules have diverse sources, including the U.N. Charter, international humanitarian law treaties, including the 1949 Geneva Conventions, as well as customary international humanitarian law. Some of these existing laws involve principles of general applicability that could encompass IW. Nevertheless, the gap between physical weaponry (whether kinetic, biological, or chemical) and IW's virtual methods can be substantial, creating translation problems.\nThe sort of intangible damage that IW attacks may cause is analytically different from the physical damage caused by the use of armed force in traditional warfare. The kind of destruction that bombs and bullets cause is easy to see and understand, and fits well within longstanding views of what war means. In contrast, the disruption of information systems, including the corruption or manipulation of stored or transmitted data, may cause intangible damage, such as disruption of civil society or government services. These may be more closely equivalent to activities such as economic sanctions that may be undertaken in times of peace rather than acts of aggression (Greenberg 1998).\nWhether or not an information warfare attack can be considered 'use of force' or 'aggression' is relevant to the fact that a forceful response can be justified as self-defense, as well as to the issue of whether a particular response would be proportionate to the original attack.\nModern law on the use of force is based on the U.N. Charter. An analysis of international law and IW could begin with the prohibition of the use of force in Article 2(4): 'All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations' (Charter of the United Nations, Art.2(4)). The drafters intended to prohibit all types of force, except those carried out under the aegis of the United Nations or as provided for by the Security Council, and wanted to restrict the use of force severely by sharply limiting its use to situations approved by the Security Council (Barkham 2001).\n201\nAlexandru Nitu\nThe fact is that neither the Charter nor any international body has defined the term ‘use of force’ clearly. That might be the main reason why the use of force prohibition encounters difficulty when translated into the IW context. Not all hostile acts are uses of force. Traditionally, states defined ‘force’ in terms of the instrument used, including ‘armed’ force within the prohibition, but excluding economic and political forms of coercion. This distinction reflects an effort to proscribe those acts most likely to interfere with the U.N.’s primary purpose: maintaining international peace and security.\nThe classic ‘instrumentality’ approach argues that IW does not qualify as armed force because it lacks the physical characteristics associated with military coercion (Hollis 2007). The analysis looks at whether there is kinetic impact: some type of explosion or physical force. The Charter was created in the days of weapons that provided blast, heat, and fragmentation damage, so it is clear that these types of kinetic weapons were exclusively present in the minds of the drafters.\nStill, some types of cyber attacks can be determined to be uses of force. Since the determination of a use of force requires that a weapon be used, there first must be a method of analogizing IW attacks to weapons. A very good method could be the one proposed by Ian Brownlie, which shifts the traditional use of force analysis from a purely kinetic analysis, based on physical force being applied to the target, to a result-based analysis, evaluating IW attacks is not limited to focusing on the method of the attack (Brownlie 1963). A result-based analysis requires looking at whether there is a kinetic result, that cause damage or injury, rather than whether the weapon itself is kinetic.\nThe text of the U.N. Charter offers additional support for the ‘instrumentality’ view in Article 41, which states that ‘measures not involving the use of armed force’ include ‘complete or partial interruption of (...) telegraphic, radio, and other means of communication’ (Charter of the United Nations, Art.41). Clearly, ‘other means of communications’ fairly encompasses computer communications and communication over computer networks. It seems that Article 41 permits countries to deprive another nation of its communications, as well as interrupting communications by manipulation of the target country's data such that it is corrupt and untrustworthy, altering the data to render it useless for that nation's purpose, and actually altering the data such that it achieves an intended purpose for the aggressor nation (DiCenso 2000). Although such measures sound like fair game for IW, the provisions of Article 41 still require the Security Council to decide what measures are to be employed under that article, including force and actions that do not include armed force.\nIn order to retain its effectiveness, the Charter’s interpretations must evolve to some degree. The extent to which this happens is important in applying use of force analysis under Article 2(4) as new types of warfare develop. If the definition of the ‘use of force’ is static, then the ban on the use of force gradually will become less effective as new interstate actions occur beyond the boundaries of what the drafters considered (Barkham 2001).\nDifficulty in characterizing certain forms of information warfare as ‘force’ or ‘aggression’ under international law does not mean that international legal institutions cannot respond to such attacks. For example, Chapter VII of the U.N. Charter gives the UN Security Council the authority and responsibility to determine the existence of any ‘threat to the peace’ or acts of aggression (Charter of the United Nations, Article 39) and the Council can recommend and lead responses to that (Charter of the United Nations, Article 40). Many information attacks that may not constitute ‘force’ or ‘aggression’ could certainly be considered threats to the peace and thus subject to Security Council action, perhaps including the use of military force. After all, anything that would anger a government to the point that it might feel the need to resort to military action could thus threaten the peace, even if the provocative action was not technically illegal (Greenberg 1998).\nOf particular interest for IW analysis is Article 51 of the U.N. Charter, the only exception to the rule stated in Article 2(4). According to Article 51, states can use force pursuant to the inherent right of self-defense in response to an armed attack: ‘Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defense if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security’ (Charter of the United Nations, Art.51). As sole authorization of unilateral use of force outside the U.N. Charter security system, this provision responds to the reality that the international community may not be able to react quickly enough to armed aggression to forestall attack on a victim state. It therefore permits states and their allies to defend themselves until the international help arrives pursuant to Chapter VII.\n202\nAlexandru Nitu\nArticle 51 restricts a state's right of self-defense to situations involving 'armed attack', a narrower category of act than Article 2(4)'s 'use of force'. Although coercion not involving armed force may violate Article 2(4) and result in action under Article 39, it does not follow that states may also react unilaterally pursuant to Article 51. This narrowing plainly reflects the Charter's preference for community responses over individual ones, even to threats to peace (Schmitt 1999). In the case of a IW attack, it is also a prudent approach due to the difficulty states may have in identifying the correct source of an attack.\nThe main problem IW poses for Article 2(4) does not derive from its large-scale applications, but from attacks that do not destroy life or property, such as subversion of property, electronic blockades, and incursions. The large-scale attacks are similar to conventional methods of warfare and fit comfortably within traditional use of force analysis. The lower-level attacks present the problem when analyzed under Article 2(4) because they threaten to erase the distinction between acts of force and acts of coercion. The severity of an IW attack might not be identified promptly, so it would not be feasible to require a victim to conduct a damage assessment to determine whether an IW penetration were a use of force or merely of coercion. (Barkham 2001)\n## 3. International legal limits on IW\n### 3.1 Limits on the use of weapons\nMany of the international legal provisions regarding armed conflicts are found in the 1949 Geneva Conventions and the 1977 Additional Protocols to the Geneva Conventions. The Geneva Conventions, with their focus on the protection of persons in enemy hands, are of some relevance to IW. Without reference to specific weapons, the Additional Protocols (AP) address various methods and means of warfare in general terms, thus being able to present a framework for the use of IW.\nIn order for International Humanitarian Law (IHL) to apply to a particular armed conflict, neither formal declaration of war, nor recognition of a state of war is required. Instead, the requirements of the law become applicable as from the actual opening of hostilities. An international armed conflict is perceived as any difference arising between two States and leading to the intervention of armed forces, even if one of the Parties denies the existence of a state of war (Pictet 1952).\nThere is no doubt that an armed conflict exists and IHL applies once traditional kinetic weapons are used in combination with new methods of IW. The most difficult situation, as far as applicability of IHL is concerned, would be the one where the first, or the only hostile acts are conducted by means of IW. The question is if this type of conflict depends on the type of attack in order to be qualified as constituting an armed conflict within the meaning of the 1949 Geneva Convention and the Additional Protocols.\nSame as in the U.N. Charter's case, the fact that IW developed only after the adoption of the Protocols does not exclude their applicability. The first Additional Protocol to the Geneva Conventions made specific reference for consideration of new weapons. Article 36 of Additional Protocol I (AP I) is a strong indicator that the drafters of AP I anticipated the application of its rules to new developments of methods and means of warfare. This provision requires that 'In the study, development, acquisition or adoption of a new weapon, means or method of warfare, a High Contracting Party is under an obligation to determine whether its employment would, in some or all circumstances, be prohibited by this Protocol or by any other rule of international law applicable to the High Contracting Party' (Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions 1977). This statement obligates a nation at least to consider the laws of armed conflict before employing IW means. That consideration should focus on both the means of force and perhaps more importantly on the effects.\nConsequently, the fact that a particular military activity constituting a method of warfare is not specifically regulated does not mean that it can be used without restrictions. Based on that, nothing precludes assuming that the more recent forms of IW, which do not involve the use of traditional weapons, are subject to IHL just as any new weapon or delivery system has been so far when used in an armed conflict. (Dörmann 2004)\nAnother fundamental rule of warfare, found in Article 35 (1) of AP I, states that 'the right of the Parties to the conflict to choose methods or means of warfare is not unlimited' (Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions 1977). So far, hostilities have involved physical violence and kinetic energy\n203\nAlexandru Nitu\nleading to human casualties or material damage. In the case of IHL, the motivation for the application of the law is to limit the damage and provide care for the casualties. This would support an expansive interpretation of when IHL begins to apply. If a cyber attack is directed against an enemy in order to cause physical damage or loss of life, it can hardly be disputed that such an attack is in fact a method of warfare and is subject to limitations under IHL. (Dörmann 2004)\n## 3.2 The principle of distinction\nJust as information warfare attacks may be difficult to encompass within the 'use of force' concept, it may be also difficult to define their targets as military (and thus generally legitimate targets) or civilian (generally forbidden). The dual-use nature of many telecommunications networks complicates the questions of the applicability of IHL as a constraint on information warfare, because the intangible damage that cyber attacks cause may not be the sort of injuries against which the humanitarian law of war is designed to protect noncombatants. (Greenberg 1998)\nThe definition of the term \"attack\" is of decisive importance for the application of the various rules giving effect to the principle of distinction and for most of the rules providing special protection for certain objects. In accordance with Art. 49 (1) of AP I, 'attacks' means acts of violence against the adversary, whether in offence or in defense (Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions 1977). If the term 'acts of violence' denotes only physical force, the concept of 'attacks' excludes dissemination of propaganda, embargoes or other non-physical means of psychological, political or economic warfare. (Dörmann 2004)\nBased on that understanding and distinction, cyber attacks through viruses, worms, logic bombs etc. that result in physical damage to persons, or damage to objects that goes beyond the computer program or data attacked can be qualified as 'acts of violence' and thus as an attack in the sense of IHL. From this point of view, it is helpful to look at how the concept of attack is applied to other means and methods of warfare. There is general agreement that, for example, the employment of biological or chemical agents that does not cause a physical explosion, such as the use of asphyxiating or poisonous gases, would constitute an attack (Dörmann 2004).\nIf one admits that employing a IW method constitute an attack, AP I imposes:\n- The obligation to direct attacks only against \"military objectives\" and not to attack civilians or civilian objects; (Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions 1977, Art. 48, 51 (2), 52)\n- The prohibition of indiscriminate attacks, including attacks that may be expected to cause excessive incidental civilian casualties or damages; (Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions 1977, Art. 51 (4), (5))\n- The requirement to take the necessary precautions to ensure that the previous two rules are respected, (Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions 1977, Art. 57) in particular the requirement to minimize incidental civilian damage and the obligation to abstain from attacks if such damage is likely to be excessive to the value of the military objective to be attacked; (Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions 1977, Art. 51 (5)(b), 57 (2)(a)(ii) and (iii))\nThese rules operate in exactly the same way whether the attack is carried out using traditional weapons or IW techniques. Problems that arise in applying these rules are therefore not necessarily unique to IW. They are more related to the interpretation of, for example, what constitutes a military objective or which collateral damage would be excessive.\n## 4. Legal perspectives on IW\nThe laws of war always faced two challenges. The first was that war's confrontational nature and tremendously high stakes often frustrated efforts to set reasonable limits on behavior. Fortunately, the international community has generated international conventions and war crimes tribunals to solve this problem.\nThe laws of war also face a second challenge, which is how to adapt these laws to technological change. This dynamic itself is as old as civilization, but it became more acute in the last one hundred years, since technological progress has accelerated. The result is that weapons are developing much faster than international law, and there is every reason to believe that this trend will continue to accelerate in the future.\n204\nAlexandru Nitu\nAs IW strategy and technology evolve, international law scholars will have to fit this new kind of warfare into an analytical framework developed to address a different conception of war.\nFirst, the U.N. Charter and other existing treaty regimes do not create a clear legal prohibition of many types of IW attacks. For international law effectively to address IW attacks there must be established a correspondence between terms like ‘use of force’, ‘armed attack’ or ‘armed aggression’ and IW methods and means of combat. Also, it would be necessary to set limits to IW activities similar to the classic *jus in bello* principles, like just war, discrimination or proportionality.\nThe second, and the more difficult part, is to find a way to solve the practical problems associated with both launching and defending against cyber attacks, including the fundamental issue of attribution and in particular state responsibility for cyber attacks. It is technically challenging to localize the physical place from which such an act originates. But even if the origin of an attack can be localized within a particular state, it would be challenging to determine whether the attacker was acting in an individual capacity, or on behalf of a criminal organization, the government or armed forces.\nJust as the identity of the attacker raises difficult questions for any potential IW treaty, so does the identity of the victim. In an IW context, it becomes necessary to ask whether an attack on a company or an institution is an attack on a whole country. It is not necessarily clear that the state in whose territory the injured party resides is the injured state. In a conventional attack, the country where the attack is located has been attacked because its territorial integrity has been violated, but cyberspace is not a customary arena over which states may exercise such control.\nFrom a humanitarian law perspective, it would be essential to be able to ‘mark’ in some way the information systems used to maintain the viability of critical social infrastructure facilities. In the physical world, some of these facilities (such as hospitals) display a distinctive sign, indicating their protected status. Such identifying signs are absent in cyberspace, nor do criteria exist for designating these systems as critical infrastructure.\n## 5. Conclusions\nBecause of the newness of much of the technology involved, no provision of international law explicitly addresses to information warfare. This absence of prohibitions is significant because, as a crudely general rule, that which international law does not prohibit it permits. But the absence is not dispositive, because even where international law does not address particular weapons or technologies, its general principles may apply to the use of those weapons and technologies (Greenberg 1998).\nAlthough the existing body of international law does not necessarily provide definitive and universally accepted answers to the legal issues that Information Warfare development rises, it does provide a structure by which these issues could be addressed and analyzed. However, in order to apply existent norms to IW, it is necessary to accept the consequence-based interpretations of “armed conflict” and “attack”. In the absence of such understandings, the applicability, and therefore adequacy, of present-day humanitarian law principles would come into question. The consideration of IW in the context of *jus ad bellum* also leads to consequence-based interpretation.\nDevising a system of international law addressing Information Warfare or Information Operations could rectify many of the deficiencies of the current legal system and provide states with additional functional benefits that do not currently exist. First, it can remedy uncertainty. Drafting new rules provides an opportunity to rectify translation problems that plague IW under the law of war. It could give states and their militaries a clear sense of the rules of engagement in the information age.\nA dedicated law would allow states not simply to choose among available interpretations of the prohibition on the use of force, but to craft a standard tailored to IW without the additional inclusion problems that currently exist. Similarly, states could set the bar for when IW triggers the civilian distinction requirement and address whether any or all information networks constitute legitimate military objectives.\nDisclaimer: The views, opinions, and recommendations contained in this analysis are those of the author and should not be construed as an official position, policy, or decision of the Romanian Intelligence Service\n205\nAlexandru Nitu",

It seems that Article 41 permits countries to deprive another nation of its communications, as well as interrupting communications by manipulation of the target country's data such that it is corrupt and untrustworthy, altering the data to render it useless for that nation's purpose, and actually altering the data such that it achieves an intended purpose for the aggressor nation. Although such measures sound like fair game for IW, the provisions of Article 41 still require the Security Council to decide what measures are to be employed under that article, including force and actions that do not include armed force.\nIn order to retain its effectiveness, the Charter’s interpretations must evolve to some degree. The extent to which this happens is important in applying use of force analysis under Article 2(4) as new types of warfare develop. If the definition of the ‘use of force’ is static, then the ban on the use of force gradually will become less effective as new interstate actions occur beyond the boundaries of what the drafters considered.\nDifficulty in characterizing certain forms of information warfare as ‘force’ or ‘aggression’ under international law does not mean that international legal institutions cannot respond to such attacks. For example, Chapter VII of the U.N. Charter gives the UN Security Council the authority and responsibility to determine the existence of any ‘threat to the peace’ or acts of aggression (Charter of the United Nations, Article 39) and the Council can recommend and lead responses to that (Charter of the United Nations, Article 40). Many information attacks that may not constitute ‘force’ or ‘aggression’ could certainly be considered threats to the peace and thus subject to Security Council action, perhaps including the use of military force. After all, anything that would anger a government to the point that it might feel the need to resort to military action could thus threaten the peace, even if the provocative action was not technically illegal.\nOf particular interest for IW analysis is Article 51 of the U.N. Charter, the only exception to the rule stated in Article 2(4). According to Article 51, states can use force pursuant to the inherent right of self-defense in response to an armed attack: ‘Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defense if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security’ (Charter of the United Nations, Art.51). As sole authorization of unilateral use of force outside the U.N. Charter security system, this provision responds to the reality that the international community may not be able to react quickly enough to armed aggression to forestall attack on a victim state. It therefore permits states and their allies to defend themselves until the international help arrives pursuant to Chapter VII.\n\nArticle 51 restricts a state's right of self-defense to situations involving 'armed attack', a narrower category of act than Article 2(4)'s 'use of force'. Although coercion not involving armed force may violate Article 2(4) and result in action under Article 39, it does not follow that states may also react unilaterally pursuant to Article 51. This narrowing plainly reflects the Charter's preference for community responses over individual ones, even to threats to peace. In the case of a IW attack, it is also a prudent approach due to the difficulty states may have in identifying the correct source of an attack.\nThe main problem IW poses for Article 2(4) does not derive from its large-scale applications, but from attacks that do not destroy life or property, such as subversion of property, electronic blockades, and incursions. The large-scale attacks are similar to conventional methods of warfare and fit comfortably within traditional use of force analysis. The lower-level attacks present the problem when analyzed under Article 2(4) because they threaten to erase the distinction between acts of force and acts of coercion. The severity of an IW attack might not be identified promptly, so it would not be feasible to require a victim to conduct a damage assessment to determine whether an IW penetration were a use of force or merely of coercion. ## 3. International legal limits on IW ### 3.1 Limits on the use of weapons Many of the international legal provisions regarding armed conflicts are found in the 1949 Geneva Conventions and the 1977 Additional Protocols to the Geneva Conventions. The Geneva Conventions, with their focus on the protection of persons in enemy hands, are of some relevance to IW. Without reference to specific weapons, the Additional Protocols (AP) address various methods and means of warfare in general terms, thus being able to present a framework for the use of IW.\nIn order for International Humanitarian Law (IHL) to apply to a particular armed conflict, neither formal declaration of war, nor recognition of a state of war is required. Instead, the requirements of the law become applicable as from the actual opening of hostilities. An international armed conflict is perceived as any difference arising between two States and leading to the intervention of armed forces, even if one of the Parties denies the existence of a state of war.\nThere is no doubt that an armed conflict exists and IHL applies once traditional kinetic weapons are used in combination with new methods of IW. The most difficult situation, as far as applicability of IHL is concerned, would be the one where the first, or the only hostile acts are conducted by means of IW. The question is if this type of conflict depends on the type of attack in order to be qualified as constituting an armed conflict within the meaning of the 1949 Geneva Convention and the Additional Protocols.\nSame as in the U.N. Charter's case, the fact that IW developed only after the adoption of the Protocols does not exclude their applicability. The first Additional Protocol to the Geneva Conventions made specific reference for consideration of new weapons. Article 36 of Additional Protocol I (AP I) is a strong indicator that the drafters of AP I anticipated the application of its rules to new developments of methods and means of warfare. This provision requires that 'In the study, development, acquisition or adoption of a new weapon, means or method of warfare, a High Contracting Party is under an obligation to determine whether its employment would, in some or all circumstances, be prohibited by this Protocol or by any other rule of international law applicable to the High Contracting Party' (Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions 1977). This statement obligates a nation at least to consider the laws of armed conflict before employing IW means. That consideration should focus on both the means of force and perhaps more importantly on the effects.\nConsequently, the fact that a particular military activity constituting a method of warfare is not specifically regulated does not mean that it can be used without restrictions. Based on that, nothing precludes assuming that the more recent forms of IW, which do not involve the use of traditional weapons, are subject to IHL just as any new weapon or delivery system has been so far when used in an armed conflict. (Dörmann 2004) Another fundamental rule of warfare, found in Article 35 (1) of AP I, states that 'the right of the Parties to the conflict to choose methods or means of warfare is not unlimited' (Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions 1977). So far, hostilities have involved physical violence and kinetic energy leading to human casualties or material damage. In the case of IHL, the motivation for the application of the law is to limit the damage and provide care for the casualties. This would support an expansive interpretation of when IHL begins to apply. If a cyber attack is directed against an enemy in order to cause physical damage or loss of life, it can hardly be disputed that such an attack is in fact a method of warfare and is subject to limitations under IHL. (Dörmann 2004) ## 3.2 The principle of distinction Just as information warfare attacks may be difficult to encompass within the 'use of force' concept, it may be also difficult to define their targets as military (and thus generally legitimate targets) or civilian (generally forbidden). The dual-use nature of many telecommunications networks complicates the questions of the applicability of IHL as a constraint on information warfare, because the intangible damage that cyber attacks cause may not be the sort of injuries against which the humanitarian law of war is designed to protect noncombatants. The definition of the term\"attack\"is of decisive importance for the application of the various rules giving effect to the principle of distinction and for most of the rules providing special protection for certain objects. In accordance with Art. 49 (1) of AP I, 'attacks' means acts of violence against the adversary, whether in offence or in defense (Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions 1977). If the term 'acts of violence' denotes only physical force, the concept of 'attacks' excludes dissemination of propaganda, embargoes or other non-physical means of psychological, political or economic warfare. (Dörmann 2004) Based on that understanding and distinction, cyber attacks through viruses, worms, logic bombs etc. that result in physical damage to persons, or damage to objects that goes beyond the computer program or data attacked can be qualified as 'acts of violence' and thus as an attack in the sense of IHL. From this point of view, it is helpful to look at how the concept of attack is applied to other means and methods of warfare. There is general agreement that, for example, the employment of biological or chemical agents that does not cause a physical explosion, such as the use of asphyxiating or poisonous gases, would constitute an attack (Dörmann 2004).\nIf one admits that employing a IW method constitute an attack, AP I imposes: - The obligation to direct attacks only against\"military objectives\"and not to attack civilians or civilian objects; (Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions 1977, Art. 48, 51 (2), 52) - The prohibition of indiscriminate attacks, including attacks that may be expected to cause excessive incidental civilian casualties or damages; (Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions 1977, Art. 51 (4), (5)) - The requirement to take the necessary precautions to ensure that the previous two rules are respected, (Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions 1977, Art. 57) in particular the requirement to minimize incidental civilian damage and the obligation to abstain from attacks if such damage is likely to be excessive to the value of the military objective to be attacked; (Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions 1977, Art. 51 (5)(b), 57 (2)(a)(ii) and (iii)) These rules operate in exactly the same way whether the attack is carried out using traditional weapons or IW techniques. Problems that arise in applying these rules are therefore not necessarily unique to IW. They are more related to the interpretation of, for example, what constitutes a military objective or which collateral damage would be excessive.\n## 4. Legal perspectives on IW The laws of war always faced two challenges. The first was that war's confrontational nature and tremendously high stakes often frustrated efforts to set reasonable limits on behavior. Fortunately, the international community has generated international conventions and war crimes tribunals to solve this problem.\nThe laws of war also face a second challenge, which is how to adapt these laws to technological change. This dynamic itself is as old as civilization, but it became more acute in the last one hundred years, since technological progress has accelerated. The result is that weapons are developing much faster than international law, and there is every reason to believe that this trend will continue to accelerate in the future.\n\nAs IW strategy and technology evolve, international law scholars will have to fit this new kind of warfare into an analytical framework developed to address a different conception of war.\nFirst, the U.N. Charter and other existing treaty regimes do not create a clear legal prohibition of many types of IW attacks. For international law effectively to address IW attacks there must be established a correspondence between terms like ‘use of force’, ‘armed attack’ or ‘armed aggression’ and IW methods and means of combat. Also, it would be necessary to set limits to IW activities similar to the classic *jus in bello* principles, like just war, discrimination or proportionality.\nThe second, and the more difficult part, is to find a way to solve the practical problems associated with both launching and defending against cyber attacks, including the fundamental issue of attribution and in particular state responsibility for cyber attacks. It is technically challenging to localize the physical place from which such an act originates. But even if the origin of an attack can be localized within a particular state, it would be challenging to determine whether the attacker was acting in an individual capacity, or on behalf of a criminal organization, the government or armed forces.\nJust as the identity of the attacker raises difficult questions for any potential IW treaty, so does the identity of the victim. In an IW context, it becomes necessary to ask whether an attack on a company or an institution is an attack on a whole country. It is not necessarily clear that the state in whose territory the injured party resides is the injured state. In a conventional attack, the country where the attack is located has been attacked because its territorial integrity has been violated, but cyberspace is not a customary arena over which states may exercise such control.\nFrom a humanitarian law perspective, it would be essential to be able to ‘mark’ in some way the information systems used to maintain the viability of critical social infrastructure facilities. In the physical world, some of these facilities (such as hospitals) display a distinctive sign, indicating their protected status. Such identifying signs are absent in cyberspace, nor do criteria exist for designating these systems as critical infrastructure.\n## 5. Conclusions Because of the newness of much of the technology involved, no provision of international law explicitly addresses to information warfare. This absence of prohibitions is significant because, as a crudely general rule, that which international law does not prohibit it permits. But the absence is not dispositive, because even where international law does not address particular weapons or technologies, its general principles may apply to the use of those weapons and technologies.\nAlthough the existing body of international law does not necessarily provide definitive and universally accepted answers to the legal issues that Information Warfare development rises, it does provide a structure by which these issues could be addressed and analyzed. However, in order to apply existent norms to IW, it is necessary to accept the consequence-based interpretations of “armed conflict” and “attack”. In the absence of such understandings, the applicability, and therefore adequacy, of present-day humanitarian law principles would come into question. The consideration of IW in the context of *jus ad bellum* also leads to consequence-based interpretation.\nDevising a system of international law addressing Information Warfare or Information Operations could rectify many of the deficiencies of the current legal system and provide states with additional functional benefits that do not currently exist. First, it can remedy uncertainty. Drafting new rules provides an opportunity to rectify translation problems that plague IW under the law of war. It could give states and their militaries a clear sense of the rules of engagement in the information age.\nA dedicated law would allow states not simply to choose among available interpretations of the prohibition on the use of force, but to craft a standard tailored to IW without the additional inclusion problems that currently exist. Similarly, states could set the bar for when IW triggers the civilian distinction requirement and address whether any or all information networks constitute legitimate military objectives.\nDisclaimer: The views, opinions, and recommendations contained in this analysis are those of the author and should not be construed as an official position, policy, or decision of the Romanian Intelligence Service",

    "__preamble__": "International Legal Issues and Approaches Regarding Information Warfare Alexandru Nitu Romanian Intelligence Service, Bucharest, Romania alexandru.nitu@gmail.com Abstract: In present times, societies and economies increasingly rely on electronic communications, becoming more vulnerable to threats from cyberspace. At the same time, states' military and intelligence organizations are increasingly developing the capability to attack and defend computer systems. The progress of information technology makes it possible for adversaries to attack each other in new ways, inflicting new forms of damage; technological change enables cyberwarfare acts that do not fit within existing legal categories, or may reveal contradictions among existing legal principles. The paper examines the relationship between information warfare and the law, especially international law and the law of war, as it is apparent that some fundamental questions regarding this new and emerging type of security threat need to be explored. For example, what types of activities between nation states, could or should be called information warfare? What are 'force', 'armed attack', or 'armed aggression' - terms from the UN Charter - in the Information Age, and do they equate to information warfare? Information warfare is neither 'armed' in the traditional sense, nor does it necessarily involve conflict, so an important issue is if 'war' between states necessarily require physical violence, kinetic energy, and human casualties. A threshold question that arises from the development of information warfare techniques is thus the definitional one: has the development of information warfare technology and techniques taken information warfare out of the existing legal definition of war? Characteristics of information technology and warfare pose problems to those who would use international law to limit information warfare, and leave legal space for those who would wage such warfare. Consequently, there may be confusion over what limits may apply to the conduct of information warfare, and when information warfare attacks may be carried out. Prospects of new technological attacks pose problems for international law because law is inherently conservative. From this point of view, the paper examines how the law itself might change in response to the fast development of information technology and how will long-established legal principles such as national sovereignty and the inviolability of national borders be affected by the ability of cyberspace to transcend such concepts.\nKeywords: international law, information warfare, use of force, Charter of the United Nations, Geneva conventions Intensive development of information and communication technologies and their wide use in all spheres of human activity have accelerated post-industrial development and the building of a global information society, becoming a driving force for social development. The global information infrastructure provides unprecedented opportunities for communication among people, their socialization and access to information. Individuals, societies and states depend on the stability and reliability of the information infrastructure.\nComputers and computer networks have become increasingly integral to government, military, and civilian functions. They allow instant communication and provide platforms on which business and government alike can operate. Computers now control both military and civilian infrastructures, including nuclear arsenals, telecommunication networks, electrical power systems, water supplies, oil storage facilities, financial systems, and emergency services.\nAs the worldwide explosion of information technology (IT) is changing the ways that business, government, and education are conducted, it also promises to change the way wars are waged. The development of information technology makes it possible for adversaries to attack each other in new ways and to inflict new forms of damage, and may create new targets for attack. Attackers may use international networks to damage or disrupt enemy systems, without ever physically entering the enemy's country.\nInformation technologies enable a fundamentally new and effective means to disrupt or destroy a country's industry, its economy, social infrastructure and public administration. They have the potential to be a means of combat capable of achieving goals related to inter-state confrontation at the tactical, operational and strategic levels. Whatever the development and diffusion of information technology mean for the future of warfare, it is apparent that many of the new forms of attack that information technology enables are qualitatively different from prior forms of attack. The use of such tools as computer intrusion and computer viruses, for example, take war out of the physical, kinetic world and bring it into an intangible, electronic one. Effects previously attainable only through physical destruction are now accomplished remotely with the silent means of information technology.\nThese new ways of fighting have been labeled Information Warfare (IW). Definitions and conceptions of IW are numerous, but generally entail preserving one's own information and information technology while exploiting, disrupting, or denying the use of an adversary's. In US military doctrine, IW it is part of a much larger strategic shift that was named Information Operations (IO). Information Operations involve actions taken to affect adversary information and information systems while defending one's own information and information systems. Information Operations apply across all phases of an operation, throughout the range of military operations, and at every level of war. Information Warfare is Information Operations conducted during time of crisis or conflict, including war, to achieve or promote specific objectives over a specific adversary or adversaries (Joint Chiefs of Staff 1998).\nThe new emerging vulnerabilities that information age generates are more likely to be exploited by opponents of developed states that cannot hope to prevail on the battlefield, or even at the negotiations table. A lesser-advantaged state hoping to seriously harm a dominant adversary must inevitably compete asymmetrically. It must seek to counter the strengths of the opponent not head-on, but rather employing unorthodox means to strike at centers of gravity.\nIW offers such asymmetrical benefits. In the first place, in many cases a computer network attack will either not merit a response involving the use of force, or the legality of such a response could be debatable, even if the victim is able to accurately identify the attack and its source. Thus, because of the potentially grave impact of cyber attacks on a state's infrastructure, it can prove a high gain, low risk option for a state outclassed militarily or economically. Moreover, to the extent that an opponent is militarily and economically advantaged, it is probably technologically dependent, and, therefore, teeming with tempting targets.",
    "## 2. IW and the 'use of force' concept Several rules govern when force can be used (the jus ad bellum, which focuses on the criteria for going to war, covering issues such as right purpose, duly constituted authority, last resort) and how states can use that force in an armed conflict (the jus in bello or 'law of war', that creates the concept of just war-fighting, covering discrimination, proportionality, humanity etc). These rules have diverse sources, including the U.N. Charter, international humanitarian law treaties, including the 1949 Geneva Conventions, as well as customary international humanitarian law. Some of these existing laws involve principles of general applicability that could encompass IW. Nevertheless, the gap between physical weaponry (whether kinetic, biological, or chemical) and IW's virtual methods can be substantial, creating translation problems.": "The sort of intangible damage that IW attacks may cause is analytically different from the physical damage caused by the use of armed force in traditional warfare. The kind of destruction that bombs and bullets cause is easy to see and understand, and fits well within longstanding views of what war means. In contrast, the disruption of information systems, including the corruption or manipulation of stored or transmitted data, may cause intangible damage, such as disruption of civil society or government services. These may be more closely equivalent to activities such as economic sanctions that may be undertaken in times of peace rather than acts of aggression.\nWhether or not an information warfare attack can be considered 'use of force' or 'aggression' is relevant to the fact that a forceful response can be justified as self-defense, as well as to the issue of whether a particular response would be proportionate to the original attack.\nModern law on the use of force is based on the U.N. Charter. An analysis of international law and IW could begin with the prohibition of the use of force in Article 2(4): 'All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations' (Charter of the United Nations, Art.2(4)). The drafters intended to prohibit all types of force, except those carried out under the aegis of the United Nations or as provided for by the Security Council, and wanted to restrict the use of force severely by sharply limiting its use to situations approved by the Security Council.\nThe fact is that neither the Charter nor any international body has defined the term ‘use of force’ clearly. That might be the main reason why the use of force prohibition encounters difficulty when translated into the IW context. Not all hostile acts are uses of force. Traditionally, states defined ‘force’ in terms of the instrument used, including ‘armed’ force within the prohibition, but excluding economic and political forms of coercion. This distinction reflects an effort to proscribe those acts most likely to interfere with the U.N.’s primary purpose: maintaining international peace and security.\nThe classic ‘instrumentality’ approach argues that IW does not qualify as armed force because it lacks the physical characteristics associated with military coercion. The analysis looks at whether there is kinetic impact: some type of explosion or physical force. The Charter was created in the days of weapons that provided blast, heat, and fragmentation damage, so it is clear that these types of kinetic weapons were exclusively present in the minds of the drafters.\nStill, some types of cyber attacks can be determined to be uses of force. Since the determination of a use of force requires that a weapon be used, there first must be a method of analogizing IW attacks to weapons. A very good method could be the one proposed by Ian Brownlie, which shifts the traditional use of force analysis from a purely kinetic analysis, based on physical force being applied to the target, to a result-based analysis, evaluating IW attacks is not limited to focusing on the method of the attack. A result-based analysis requires looking at whether there is a kinetic result, that cause damage or injury, rather than whether the weapon itself is kinetic.\nThe text of the U.N. Charter offers additional support for the ‘instrumentality’ view in Article 41, which states that ‘measures not involving the use of armed force’ include ‘complete or partial interruption of (...) telegraphic, radio, and other means of communication’ (Charter of the United Nations, Art.41). Clearly, ‘other means of communications’ fairly encompasses computer communications and communication over computer networks. It seems that Article 41 permits countries to deprive another nation of its communications, as well as interrupting communications by manipulation of the target country's data such that it is corrupt and untrustworthy, altering the data to render it useless for that nation's purpose, and actually altering the data such that it achieves an intended purpose for the aggressor nation. Although such measures sound like fair game for IW, the provisions of Article 41 still require the Security Council to decide what measures are to be employed under that article, including force and actions that do not include armed force.\nIn order to retain its effectiveness, the Charter’s interpretations must evolve to some degree. The extent to which this happens is important in applying use of force analysis under Article 2(4) as new types of warfare develop. If the definition of the ‘use of force’ is static, then the ban on the use of force gradually will become less effective as new interstate actions occur beyond the boundaries of what the drafters considered.\nDifficulty in characterizing certain forms of information warfare as ‘force’ or ‘aggression’ under international law does not mean that international legal institutions cannot respond to such attacks. For example, Chapter VII of the U.N. Charter gives the UN Security Council the authority and responsibility to determine the existence of any ‘threat to the peace’ or acts of aggression (Charter of the United Nations, Article 39) and the Council can recommend and lead responses to that (Charter of the United Nations, Article 40). Many information attacks that may not constitute ‘force’ or ‘aggression’ could certainly be considered threats to the peace and thus subject to Security Council action, perhaps including the use of military force. After all, anything that would anger a government to the point that it might feel the need to resort to military action could thus threaten the peace, even if the provocative action was not technically illegal.\nOf particular interest for IW analysis is Article 51 of the U.N.

(Dörmann 2004) Based on that understanding and distinction, cyber attacks through viruses, worms, logic bombs etc. that result in physical damage to persons, or damage to objects that goes beyond the computer program or data attacked can be qualified as 'acts of violence' and thus as an attack in the sense of IHL. From this point of view, it is helpful to look at how the concept of attack is applied to other means and methods of warfare. There is general agreement that, for example, the employment of biological or chemical agents that does not cause a physical explosion, such as the use of asphyxiating or poisonous gases, would constitute an attack (Dörmann 2004).\nIf one admits that employing a IW method constitute an attack, AP I imposes: - The obligation to direct attacks only against\"military objectives\"and not to attack civilians or civilian objects; (Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions 1977, Art. 48, 51 (2), 52) - The prohibition of indiscriminate attacks, including attacks that may be expected to cause excessive incidental civilian casualties or damages; (Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions 1977, Art. 51 (4), (5)) - The requirement to take the necessary precautions to ensure that the previous two rules are respected, (Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions 1977, Art. 57) in particular the requirement to minimize incidental civilian damage and the obligation to abstain from attacks if such damage is likely to be excessive to the value of the military objective to be attacked; (Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions 1977, Art. 51 (5)(b), 57 (2)(a)(ii) and (iii)) These rules operate in exactly the same way whether the attack is carried out using traditional weapons or IW techniques. Problems that arise in applying these rules are therefore not necessarily unique to IW. They are more related to the interpretation of, for example, what constitutes a military objective or which collateral damage would be excessive.",
    "## 4. Legal perspectives on IW The laws of war always faced two challenges. The first was that war's confrontational nature and tremendously high stakes often frustrated efforts to set reasonable limits on behavior. Fortunately, the international community has generated international conventions and war crimes tribunals to solve this problem.": "The laws of war also face a second challenge, which is how to adapt these laws to technological change. This dynamic itself is as old as civilization, but it became more acute in the last one hundred years, since technological progress has accelerated. The result is that weapons are developing much faster than international law, and there is every reason to believe that this trend will continue to accelerate in the future.\nAs IW strategy and technology evolve, international law scholars will have to fit this new kind of warfare into an analytical framework developed to address a different conception of war.\nFirst, the U.N. Charter and other existing treaty regimes do not create a clear legal prohibition of many types of IW attacks. For international law effectively to address IW attacks there must be established a correspondence between terms like ‘use of force’, ‘armed attack’ or ‘armed aggression’ and IW methods and means of combat. Also, it would be necessary to set limits to IW activities similar to the classic *jus in bello* principles, like just war, discrimination or proportionality.\nThe second, and the more difficult part, is to find a way to solve the practical problems associated with both launching and defending against cyber attacks, including the fundamental issue of attribution and in particular state responsibility for cyber attacks. It is technically challenging to localize the physical place from which such an act originates. But even if the origin of an attack can be localized within a particular state, it would be challenging to determine whether the attacker was acting in an individual capacity, or on behalf of a criminal organization, the government or armed forces.\nJust as the identity of the attacker raises difficult questions for any potential IW treaty, so does the identity of the victim. In an IW context, it becomes necessary to ask whether an attack on a company or an institution is an attack on a whole country. It is not necessarily clear that the state in whose territory the injured party resides is the injured state. In a conventional attack, the country where the attack is located has been attacked because its territorial integrity has been violated, but cyberspace is not a customary arena over which states may exercise such control.\nFrom a humanitarian law perspective, it would be essential to be able to ‘mark’ in some way the information systems used to maintain the viability of critical social infrastructure facilities. In the physical world, some of these facilities (such as hospitals) display a distinctive sign, indicating their protected status. Such identifying signs are absent in cyberspace, nor do criteria exist for designating these systems as critical infrastructure.",
    "## 5. Conclusions Because of the newness of much of the technology involved, no provision of international law explicitly addresses to information warfare. This absence of prohibitions is significant because, as a crudely general rule, that which international law does not prohibit it permits. But the absence is not dispositive, because even where international law does not address particular weapons or technologies, its general principles may apply to the use of those weapons and technologies.": "Although the existing body of international law does not necessarily provide definitive and universally accepted answers to the legal issues that Information Warfare development rises, it does provide a structure by which these issues could be addressed and analyzed. However, in order to apply existent norms to IW, it is necessary to accept the consequence-based interpretations of “armed conflict” and “attack”. In the absence of such understandings, the applicability, and therefore adequacy, of present-day humanitarian law principles would come into question. The consideration of IW in the context of *jus ad bellum* also leads to consequence-based interpretation.\nDevising a system of international law addressing Information Warfare or Information Operations could rectify many of the deficiencies of the current legal system and provide states with additional functional benefits that do not currently exist. First, it can remedy uncertainty. Drafting new rules provides an opportunity to rectify translation problems that plague IW under the law of war. It could give states and their militaries a clear sense of the rules of engagement in the information age.\nA dedicated law would allow states not simply to choose among available interpretations of the prohibition on the use of force, but to craft a standard tailored to IW without the additional inclusion problems that currently exist. Similarly, states could set the bar for when IW triggers the civilian distinction requirement and address whether any or all information networks constitute legitimate military objectives.\nDisclaimer: The views, opinions, and recommendations contained in this analysis are those of the author and should not be construed as an official position, policy, or decision of the Romanian Intelligence Service"

    "flat_text": "International Legal Issues and Approaches Regarding Information Warfare Alexandru Nitu Romanian Intelligence Service, Bucharest, Romania alexandru.nitu@gmail.com Abstract: In present times, societies and economies increasingly rely on electronic communications, becoming more vulnerable to threats from cyberspace. At the same time, states' military and intelligence organizations are increasingly developing the capability to attack and defend computer systems. The progress of information technology makes it possible for adversaries to attack each other in new ways, inflicting new forms of damage; technological change enables cyberwarfare acts that do not fit within existing legal categories, or may reveal contradictions among existing legal principles. The paper examines the relationship between information warfare and the law, especially international law and the law of war, as it is apparent that some fundamental questions regarding this new and emerging type of security threat need to be explored. For example, what types of activities between nation states, could or should be called information warfare? What are 'force', 'armed attack', or 'armed aggression' - terms from the UN Charter - in the Information Age, and do they equate to information warfare? Information warfare is neither 'armed' in the traditional sense, nor does it necessarily involve conflict, so an important issue is if 'war' between states necessarily require physical violence, kinetic energy, and human casualties. A threshold question that arises from the development of information warfare techniques is thus the definitional one: has the development of information warfare technology and techniques taken information warfare out of the existing legal definition of war? Characteristics of information technology and warfare pose problems to those who would use international law to limit information warfare, and leave legal space for those who would wage such warfare. Consequently, there may be confusion over what limits may apply to the conduct of information warfare, and when information warfare attacks may be carried out. Prospects of new technological attacks pose problems for international law because law is inherently conservative. From this point of view, the paper examines how the law itself might change in response to the fast development of information technology and how will long-established legal principles such as national sovereignty and the inviolability of national borders be affected by the ability of cyberspace to transcend such concepts.\nKeywords: international law, information warfare, use of force, Charter of the United Nations, Geneva conventions Intensive development of information and communication technologies and their wide use in all spheres of human activity have accelerated post-industrial development and the building of a global information society, becoming a driving force for social development. The global information infrastructure provides unprecedented opportunities for communication among people, their socialization and access to information. Individuals, societies and states depend on the stability and reliability of the information infrastructure.\nComputers and computer networks have become increasingly integral to government, military, and civilian functions. They allow instant communication and provide platforms on which business and government alike can operate. Computers now control both military and civilian infrastructures, including nuclear arsenals, telecommunication networks, electrical power systems, water supplies, oil storage facilities, financial systems, and emergency services.\nAs the worldwide explosion of information technology (IT) is changing the ways that business, government, and education are conducted, it also promises to change the way wars are waged. The development of information technology makes it possible for adversaries to attack each other in new ways and to inflict new forms of damage, and may create new targets for attack. Attackers may use international networks to damage or disrupt enemy systems, without ever physically entering the enemy's country.\nInformation technologies enable a fundamentally new and effective means to disrupt or destroy a country's industry, its economy, social infrastructure and public administration. They have the potential to be a means of combat capable of achieving goals related to inter-state confrontation at the tactical, operational and strategic levels. Whatever the development and diffusion of information technology mean for the future of warfare, it is apparent that many of the new forms of attack that information technology enables are qualitatively different from prior forms of attack. The use of such tools as computer intrusion and computer viruses, for example, take war out of the physical, kinetic world and bring it into an intangible, electronic one. Effects previously attainable only through physical destruction are now accomplished remotely with the silent means of information technology.\nThese new ways of fighting have been labeled Information Warfare (IW). Definitions and conceptions of IW are numerous, but generally entail preserving one's own information and information technology while exploiting, disrupting, or denying the use of an adversary's. In US military doctrine, IW it is part of a much larger strategic shift that was named Information Operations (IO). Information Operations involve actions taken to affect adversary information and information systems while defending one's own information and information systems. Information Operations apply across all phases of an operation, throughout the range of military operations, and at every level of war. Information Warfare is Information Operations conducted during time of crisis or conflict, including war, to achieve or promote specific objectives over a specific adversary or adversaries (Joint Chiefs of Staff 1998).\nThe new emerging vulnerabilities that information age generates are more likely to be exploited by opponents of developed states that cannot hope to prevail on the battlefield, or even at the negotiations table. A lesser-advantaged state hoping to seriously harm a dominant adversary must inevitably compete asymmetrically. It must seek to counter the strengths of the opponent not head-on, but rather employing unorthodox means to strike at centers of gravity.\nIW offers such asymmetrical benefits. In the first place, in many cases a computer network attack will either not merit a response involving the use of force, or the legality of such a response could be debatable, even if the victim is able to accurately identify the attack and its source. Thus, because of the potentially grave impact of cyber attacks on a state's infrastructure, it can prove a high gain, low risk option for a state outclassed militarily or economically. Moreover, to the extent that an opponent is militarily and economically advantaged, it is probably technologically dependent, and, therefore, teeming with tempting targets.\n## 2. IW and the 'use of force' concept Several rules govern when force can be used (the jus ad bellum, which focuses on the criteria for going to war, covering issues such as right purpose, duly constituted authority, last resort) and how states can use that force in an armed conflict (the jus in bello or 'law of war', that creates the concept of just war-fighting, covering discrimination, proportionality, humanity etc). These rules have diverse sources, including the U.N. Charter, international humanitarian law treaties, including the 1949 Geneva Conventions, as well as customary international humanitarian law. Some of these existing laws involve principles of general applicability that could encompass IW. Nevertheless, the gap between physical weaponry (whether kinetic, biological, or chemical) and IW's virtual methods can be substantial, creating translation problems.\nThe sort of intangible damage that IW attacks may cause is analytically different from the physical damage caused by the use of armed force in traditional warfare. The kind of destruction that bombs and bullets cause is easy to see and understand, and fits well within longstanding views of what war means. In contrast, the disruption of information systems, including the corruption or manipulation of stored or transmitted data, may cause intangible damage, such as disruption of civil society or government services. These may be more closely equivalent to activities such as economic sanctions that may be undertaken in times of peace rather than acts of aggression.\nWhether or not an information warfare attack can be considered 'use of force' or 'aggression' is relevant to the fact that a forceful response can be justified as self-defense, as well as to the issue of whether a particular response would be proportionate to the original attack.\nModern law on the use of force is based on the U.N. Charter. An analysis of international law and IW could begin with the prohibition of the use of force in Article 2(4): 'All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations' (Charter of the United Nations, Art.2(4)). The drafters intended to prohibit all types of force, except those carried out under the aegis of the United Nations or as provided for by the Security Council, and wanted to restrict the use of force severely by sharply limiting its use to situations approved by the Security Council.\n\nThe fact is that neither the Charter nor any international body has defined the term ‘use of force’ clearly. That might be the main reason why the use of force prohibition encounters difficulty when translated into the IW context. Not all hostile acts are uses of force. Traditionally, states defined ‘force’ in terms of the instrument used, including ‘armed’ force within the prohibition, but excluding economic and political forms of coercion. This distinction reflects an effort to proscribe those acts most likely to interfere with the U.N.’s primary purpose: maintaining international peace and security.\nThe classic ‘instrumentality’ approach argues that IW does not qualify as armed force because it lacks the physical characteristics associated with military coercion. The analysis looks at whether there is kinetic impact: some type of explosion or physical force. The Charter was created in the days of weapons that provided blast, heat, and fragmentation damage, so it is clear that these types of kinetic weapons were exclusively present in the minds of the drafters.\nStill, some types of cyber attacks can be determined to be uses of force. Since the determination of a use of force requires that a weapon be used, there first must be a method of analogizing IW attacks to weapons. A very good method could be the one proposed by Ian Brownlie, which shifts the traditional use of force analysis from a purely kinetic analysis, based on physical force being applied to the target, to a result-based analysis, evaluating IW attacks is not limited to focusing on the method of the attack. A result-based analysis requires looking at whether there is a kinetic result, that cause damage or injury, rather than whether the weapon itself is kinetic.\nThe text of the U.N. Charter offers additional support for the ‘instrumentality’ view in Article 41, which states that ‘measures not involving the use of armed force’ include ‘complete or partial interruption of (...) telegraphic, radio, and other means of communication’ (Charter of the United Nations, Art.41). Clearly, ‘other means of communications’ fairly encompasses computer communications and communication over computer networks. It seems that Article 41 permits countries to deprive another nation of its communications, as well as interrupting communications by manipulation of the target country's data such that it is corrupt and untrustworthy, altering the data to render it useless for that nation's purpose, and actually altering the data such that it achieves an intended purpose for the aggressor nation. Although such measures sound like fair game for IW, the provisions of Article 41 still require the Security Council to decide what measures are to be employed under that article, including force and actions that do not include armed force.\nIn order to retain its effectiveness, the Charter’s interpretations must evolve to some degree. The extent to which this happens is important in applying use of force analysis under Article 2(4) as new types of warfare develop. If the definition of the ‘use of force’ is static, then the ban on the use of force gradually will become less effective as new interstate actions occur beyond the boundaries of what the drafters considered.\nDifficulty in characterizing certain forms of information warfare as ‘force’ or ‘aggression’ under international law does not mean that international legal institutions cannot respond to such attacks. For example, Chapter VII of the U.N. Charter gives the UN Security Council the authority and responsibility to determine the existence of any ‘threat to the peace’ or acts of aggression (Charter of the United Nations, Article 39) and the Council can recommend and lead responses to that (Charter of the United Nations, Article 40). Many information attacks that may not constitute ‘force’ or ‘aggression’ could certainly be considered threats to the peace and thus subject to Security Council action, perhaps including the use of military force. After all, anything that would anger a government to the point that it might feel the need to resort to military action could thus threaten the peace, even if the provocative action was not technically illegal.\nOf particular interest for IW analysis is Article 51 of the U.N. Charter, the only exception to the rule stated in Article 2(4). According to Article 51, states can use force pursuant to the inherent right of self-defense in response to an armed attack: ‘Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defense if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security’ (Charter of the United Nations, Art.51). As sole authorization of unilateral use of force outside the U.N. Charter security system, this provision responds to the reality that the international community may not be able to react quickly enough to armed aggression to forestall attack on a victim state. It therefore permits states and their allies to defend themselves until the international help arrives pursuant to Chapter VII.\n\nArticle 51 restricts a state's right of self-defense to situations involving 'armed attack', a narrower category of act than Article 2(4)'s 'use of force'. Although coercion not involving armed force may violate Article 2(4) and result in action under Article 39, it does not follow that states may also react unilaterally pursuant to Article 51. This narrowing plainly reflects the Charter's preference for community responses over individual ones, even to threats to peace. In the case of a IW attack, it is also a prudent approach due to the difficulty states may have in identifying the correct source of an attack.\nThe main problem IW poses for Article 2(4) does not derive from its large-scale applications, but from attacks that do not destroy life or property, such as subversion of property, electronic blockades, and incursions. The large-scale attacks are similar to conventional methods of warfare and fit comfortably within traditional use of force analysis. The lower-level attacks present the problem when analyzed under Article 2(4) because they threaten to erase the distinction between acts of force and acts of coercion. The severity of an IW attack might not be identified promptly, so it would not be feasible to require a victim to conduct a damage assessment to determine whether an IW penetration were a use of force or merely of coercion. ## 3. International legal limits on IW ### 3.1 Limits on the use of weapons Many of the international legal provisions regarding armed conflicts are found in the 1949 Geneva Conventions and the 1977 Additional Protocols to the Geneva Conventions. The Geneva Conventions, with their focus on the protection of persons in enemy hands, are of some relevance to IW. Without reference to specific weapons, the Additional Protocols (AP) address various methods and means of warfare in general terms, thus being able to present a framework for the use of IW.\nIn order for International Humanitarian Law (IHL) to apply to a particular armed conflict, neither formal declaration of war, nor recognition of a state of war is required. Instead, the requirements of the law become applicable as from the actual opening of hostilities. An international armed conflict is perceived as any difference arising between two States and leading to the intervention of armed forces, even if one of the Parties denies the existence of a state of war.\nThere is no doubt that an armed conflict exists and IHL applies once traditional kinetic weapons are used in combination with new methods of IW. The most difficult situation, as far as applicability of IHL is concerned, would be the one where the first, or the only hostile acts are conducted by means of IW. The question is if this type of conflict depends on the type of attack in order to be qualified as constituting an armed conflict within the meaning of the 1949 Geneva Convention and the Additional Protocols.\nSame as in the U.N. Charter's case, the fact that IW developed only after the adoption of the Protocols does not exclude their applicability. The first Additional Protocol to the Geneva Conventions made specific reference for consideration of new weapons. Article 36 of Additional Protocol I (AP I) is a strong indicator that the drafters of AP I anticipated the application of its rules to new developments of methods and means of warfare. This provision requires that 'In the study, development, acquisition or adoption of a new weapon, means or method of warfare, a High Contracting Party is under an obligation to determine whether its employment would, in some or all circumstances, be prohibited by this Protocol or by any other rule of international law applicable to the High Contracting Party' (Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions 1977). This statement obligates a nation at least to consider the laws of armed conflict before employing IW means. That consideration should focus on both the means of force and perhaps more importantly on the effects.\nConsequently, the fact that a particular military activity constituting a method of warfare is not specifically regulated does not mean that it can be used without restrictions. Based on that, nothing precludes assuming that the more recent forms of IW, which do not involve the use of traditional weapons, are subject to IHL just as any new weapon or delivery system has been so far when used in an armed conflict. (Dörmann 2004) Another fundamental rule of warfare, found in Article 35 (1) of AP I, states that 'the right of the Parties to the conflict to choose methods or means of warfare is not unlimited' (Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions 1977). So far, hostilities have involved physical violence and kinetic energy leading to human casualties or material damage. In the case of IHL, the motivation for the application of the law is to limit the damage and provide care for the casualties. This would support an expansive interpretation of when IHL begins to apply. If a cyber attack is directed against an enemy in order to cause physical damage or loss of life, it can hardly be disputed that such an attack is in fact a method of warfare and is subject to limitations under IHL. (Dörmann 2004) ## 3.2 The principle of distinction Just as information warfare attacks may be difficult to encompass within the 'use of force' concept, it may be also difficult to define their targets as military (and thus generally legitimate targets) or civilian (generally forbidden). The dual-use nature of many telecommunications networks complicates the questions of the applicability of IHL as a constraint on information warfare, because the intangible damage that cyber attacks cause may not be the sort of injuries against which the humanitarian law of war is designed to protect noncombatants. The definition of the term\"attack\"is of decisive importance for the application of the various rules giving effect to the principle of distinction and for most of the rules providing special protection for certain objects. In accordance with Art. 49 (1) of AP I, 'attacks' means acts of violence against the adversary, whether in offence or in defense (Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions 1977). If the term 'acts of violence' denotes only physical force, the concept of 'attacks' excludes dissemination of propaganda, embargoes or other non-physical means of psychological, political or economic warfare. (Dörmann 2004) Based on that understanding and distinction, cyber attacks through viruses, worms, logic bombs etc. that result in physical damage to persons, or damage to objects that goes beyond the computer program or data attacked can be qualified as 'acts of violence' and thus as an attack in the sense of IHL. From this point of view, it is helpful to look at how the concept of attack is applied to other means and methods of warfare. There is general agreement that, for example, the employment of biological or chemical agents that does not cause a physical explosion, such as the use of asphyxiating or poisonous gases, would constitute an attack (Dörmann 2004).\nIf one admits that employing a IW method constitute an attack, AP I imposes: - The obligation to direct attacks only against\"military objectives\"and not to attack civilians or civilian objects; (Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions 1977, Art. 48, 51 (2), 52) - The prohibition of indiscriminate attacks, including attacks that may be expected to cause excessive incidental civilian casualties or damages; (Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions 1977, Art. 51 (4), (5)) - The requirement to take the necessary precautions to ensure that the previous two rules are respected, (Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions 1977, Art. 57) in particular the requirement to minimize incidental civilian damage and the obligation to abstain from attacks if such damage is likely to be excessive to the value of the military objective to be attacked; (Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions 1977, Art. 51 (5)(b), 57 (2)(a)(ii) and (iii)) These rules operate in exactly the same way whether the attack is carried out using traditional weapons or IW techniques. Problems that arise in applying these rules are therefore not necessarily unique to IW. They are more related to the interpretation of, for example, what constitutes a military objective or which collateral damage would be excessive.\n## 4. Legal perspectives on IW The laws of war always faced two challenges. The first was that war's confrontational nature and tremendously high stakes often frustrated efforts to set reasonable limits on behavior. Fortunately, the international community has generated international conventions and war crimes tribunals to solve this problem.\nThe laws of war also face a second challenge, which is how to adapt these laws to technological change. This dynamic itself is as old as civilization, but it became more acute in the last one hundred years, since technological progress has accelerated. The result is that weapons are developing much faster than international law, and there is every reason to believe that this trend will continue to accelerate in the future.\n\nAs IW strategy and technology evolve, international law scholars will have to fit this new kind of warfare into an analytical framework developed to address a different conception of war.\nFirst, the U.N. Charter and other existing treaty regimes do not create a clear legal prohibition of many types of IW attacks. For international law effectively to address IW attacks there must be established a correspondence between terms like ‘use of force’, ‘armed attack’ or ‘armed aggression’ and IW methods and means of combat. Also, it would be necessary to set limits to IW activities similar to the classic *jus in bello* principles, like just war, discrimination or proportionality.\nThe second, and the more difficult part, is to find a way to solve the practical problems associated with both launching and defending against cyber attacks, including the fundamental issue of attribution and in particular state responsibility for cyber attacks. It is technically challenging to localize the physical place from which such an act originates. But even if the origin of an attack can be localized within a particular state, it would be challenging to determine whether the attacker was acting in an individual capacity, or on behalf of a criminal organization, the government or armed forces.\nJust as the identity of the attacker raises difficult questions for any potential IW treaty, so does the identity of the victim. In an IW context, it becomes necessary to ask whether an attack on a company or an institution is an attack on a whole country. It is not necessarily clear that the state in whose territory the injured party resides is the injured state. In a conventional attack, the country where the attack is located has been attacked because its territorial integrity has been violated, but cyberspace is not a customary arena over which states may exercise such control.\nFrom a humanitarian law perspective, it would be essential to be able to ‘mark’ in some way the information systems used to maintain the viability of critical social infrastructure facilities. In the physical world, some of these facilities (such as hospitals) display a distinctive sign, indicating their protected status. Such identifying signs are absent in cyberspace, nor do criteria exist for designating these systems as critical infrastructure.\n## 5. Conclusions Because of the newness of much of the technology involved, no provision of international law explicitly addresses to information warfare. This absence of prohibitions is significant because, as a crudely general rule, that which international law does not prohibit it permits. But the absence is not dispositive, because even where international law does not address particular weapons or technologies, its general principles may apply to the use of those weapons and technologies.\nAlthough the existing body of international law does not necessarily provide definitive and universally accepted answers to the legal issues that Information Warfare development rises, it does provide a structure by which these issues could be addressed and analyzed. However, in order to apply existent norms to IW, it is necessary to accept the consequence-based interpretations of “armed conflict” and “attack”. In the absence of such understandings, the applicability, and therefore adequacy, of present-day humanitarian law principles would come into question. The consideration of IW in the context of *jus ad bellum* also leads to consequence-based interpretation.\nDevising a system of international law addressing Information Warfare or Information Operations could rectify many of the deficiencies of the current legal system and provide states with additional functional benefits that do not currently exist. First, it can remedy uncertainty. Drafting new rules provides an opportunity to rectify translation problems that plague IW under the law of war. It could give states and their militaries a clear sense of the rules of engagement in the information age.\nA dedicated law would allow states not simply to choose among available interpretations of the prohibition on the use of force, but to craft a standard tailored to IW without the additional inclusion problems that currently exist. Similarly, states could set the bar for when IW triggers the civilian distinction requirement and address whether any or all information networks constitute legitimate military objectives.\nDisclaimer: The views, opinions, and recommendations contained in this analysis are those of the author and should not be construed as an official position, policy, or decision of the Romanian Intelligence Service",

Introduction\nIntensive development of information and communication technologies and their wide use in all spheres of human activity have accelerated post-industrial development and the building of a global information society, becoming a driving force for social development. The global information infrastructure provides unprecedented opportunities for communication among people, their socialization and access to information. Individuals, societies and states depend on the stability and reliability of the information infrastructure.\nComputers and computer networks have become increasingly integral to government, military, and civilian functions. They allow instant communication and provide platforms on which business and government alike can operate. Computers now control both military and civilian infrastructures, including nuclear arsenals, telecommunication networks, electrical power systems, water supplies, oil storage facilities, financial systems, and emergency services.\nAs the worldwide explosion of information technology (IT) is changing the ways that business, government, and education are conducted, it also promises to change the way wars are waged. The development of information technology makes it possible for adversaries to attack each other in new ways and to inflict new forms of damage, and may create new targets for attack. Attackers may use international networks to damage or disrupt enemy systems, without ever physically entering the enemy's country.\nInformation technologies enable a fundamentally new and effective means to disrupt or destroy a country's industry, its economy, social infrastructure and public administration. They have the potential to be a means of combat capable of achieving goals related to inter-state confrontation at the tactical, operational and strategic levels. Whatever the development and diffusion of information technology mean for the future of warfare, it is apparent that many of the new forms of attack that information technology enables are qualitatively different from prior forms of attack. The use of such tools as computer intrusion and computer viruses, for example, take war out of the physical, kinetic\n200\nAlexandru Nitu\nworld and bring it into an intangible, electronic one. Effects previously attainable only through physical destruction are now accomplished remotely with the silent means of information technology.\nThese new ways of fighting have been labeled Information Warfare (IW). Definitions and conceptions of IW are numerous, but generally entail preserving one's own information and information technology while exploiting, disrupting, or denying the use of an adversary's (Shackelford 2009). In US military doctrine, IW it is part of a much larger strategic shift that was named Information Operations (IO). Information Operations involve actions taken to affect adversary information and information systems while defending one's own information and information systems. Information Operations apply across all phases of an operation, throughout the range of military operations, and at every level of war. Information Warfare is Information Operations conducted during time of crisis or conflict, including war, to achieve or promote specific objectives over a specific adversary or adversaries (Joint Chiefs of Staff 1998).\nThe new emerging vulnerabilities that information age generates are more likely to be exploited by opponents of developed states that cannot hope to prevail on the battlefield, or even at the negotiations table. A lesser-advantaged state hoping to seriously harm a dominant adversary must inevitably compete asymmetrically. It must seek to counter the strengths of the opponent not head-on, but rather employing unorthodox means to strike at centers of gravity.\nIW offers such asymmetrical benefits. In the first place, in many cases a computer network attack will either not merit a response involving the use of force, or the legality of such a response could be debatable, even if the victim is able to accurately identify the attack and its source. Thus, because of the potentially grave impact of cyber attacks on a state's infrastructure, it can prove a high gain, low risk option for a state outclassed militarily or economically. Moreover, to the extent that an opponent is militarily and economically advantaged, it is probably technologically dependent, and, therefore, teeming with tempting targets.\n## 2. IW and the 'use of force' concept\nSeveral rules govern when force can be used (the jus ad bellum, which focuses on the criteria for going to war, covering issues such as right purpose, duly constituted authority, last resort) and how states can use that force in an armed conflict (the jus in bello or 'law of war', that creates the concept of just war-fighting, covering discrimination, proportionality, humanity etc). These rules have diverse sources, including the U.N. Charter, international humanitarian law treaties, including the 1949 Geneva Conventions, as well as customary international humanitarian law. Some of these existing laws involve principles of general applicability that could encompass IW. Nevertheless, the gap between physical weaponry (whether kinetic, biological, or chemical) and IW's virtual methods can be substantial, creating translation problems.\nThe sort of intangible damage that IW attacks may cause is analytically different from the physical damage caused by the use of armed force in traditional warfare. The kind of destruction that bombs and bullets cause is easy to see and understand, and fits well within longstanding views of what war means. In contrast, the disruption of information systems, including the corruption or manipulation of stored or transmitted data, may cause intangible damage, such as disruption of civil society or government services. These may be more closely equivalent to activities such as economic sanctions that may be undertaken in times of peace rather than acts of aggression (Greenberg 1998).\nWhether or not an information warfare attack can be considered 'use of force' or 'aggression' is relevant to the fact that a forceful response can be justified as self-defense, as well as to the issue of whether a particular response would be proportionate to the original attack.\nModern law on the use of force is based on the U.N. Charter. An analysis of international law and IW could begin with the prohibition of the use of force in Article 2(4): 'All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations' (Charter of the United Nations, Art.2(4)). The drafters intended to prohibit all types of force, except those carried out under the aegis of the United Nations or as provided for by the Security Council, and wanted to restrict the use of force severely by sharply limiting its use to situations approved by the Security Council (Barkham 2001).\n201\nAlexandru Nitu\nThe fact is that neither the Charter nor any international body has defined the term ‘use of force’ clearly. That might be the main reason why the use of force prohibition encounters difficulty when translated into the IW context. Not all hostile acts are uses of force. Traditionally, states defined ‘force’ in terms of the instrument used, including ‘armed’ force within the prohibition, but excluding economic and political forms of coercion. This distinction reflects an effort to proscribe those acts most likely to interfere with the U.N.’s primary purpose: maintaining international peace and security.\nThe classic ‘instrumentality’ approach argues that IW does not qualify as armed force because it lacks the physical characteristics associated with military coercion (Hollis 2007). The analysis looks at whether there is kinetic impact: some type of explosion or physical force. The Charter was created in the days of weapons that provided blast, heat, and fragmentation damage, so it is clear that these types of kinetic weapons were exclusively present in the minds of the drafters.\nStill, some types of cyber attacks can be determined to be uses of force. Since the determination of a use of force requires that a weapon be used, there first must be a method of analogizing IW attacks to weapons. A very good method could be the one proposed by Ian Brownlie, which shifts the traditional use of force analysis from a purely kinetic analysis, based on physical force being applied to the target, to a result-based analysis, evaluating IW attacks is not limited to focusing on the method of the attack (Brownlie 1963). A result-based analysis requires looking at whether there is a kinetic result, that cause damage or injury, rather than whether the weapon itself is kinetic.\nThe text of the U.N. Charter offers additional support for the ‘instrumentality’ view in Article 41, which states that ‘measures not involving the use of armed force’ include ‘complete or partial interruption of (...) telegraphic, radio, and other means of communication’ (Charter of the United Nations, Art.41). Clearly, ‘other means of communications’ fairly encompasses computer communications and communication over computer networks. It seems that Article 41 permits countries to deprive another nation of its communications, as well as interrupting communications by manipulation of the target country's data such that it is corrupt and untrustworthy, altering the data to render it useless for that nation's purpose, and actually altering the data such that it achieves an intended purpose for the aggressor nation (DiCenso 2000). Although such measures sound like fair game for IW, the provisions of Article 41 still require the Security Council to decide what measures are to be employed under that article, including force and actions that do not include armed force.\nIn order to retain its effectiveness, the Charter’s interpretations must evolve to some degree. The extent to which this happens is important in applying use of force analysis under Article 2(4) as new types of warfare develop. If the definition of the ‘use of force’ is static, then the ban on the use of force gradually will become less effective as new interstate actions occur beyond the boundaries of what the drafters considered (Barkham 2001).\nDifficulty in characterizing certain forms of information warfare as ‘force’ or ‘aggression’ under international law does not mean that international legal institutions cannot respond to such attacks. For example, Chapter VII of the U.N. Charter gives the UN Security Council the authority and responsibility to determine the existence of any ‘threat to the peace’ or acts of aggression (Charter of the United Nations, Article 39) and the Council can recommend and lead responses to that (Charter of the United Nations, Article 40). Many information attacks that may not constitute ‘force’ or ‘aggression’ could certainly be considered threats to the peace and thus subject to Security Council action, perhaps including the use of military force. After all, anything that would anger a government to the point that it might feel the need to resort to military action could thus threaten the peace, even if the provocative action was not technically illegal (Greenberg 1998).\nOf particular interest for IW analysis is Article 51 of the U.N. Charter, the only exception to the rule stated in Article 2(4). According to Article 51, states can use force pursuant to the inherent right of self-defense in response to an armed attack: ‘Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defense if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security’ (Charter of the United Nations, Art.51). As sole authorization of unilateral use of force outside the U.N. Charter security system, this provision responds to the reality that the international community may not be able to react quickly enough to armed aggression to forestall attack on a victim state. It therefore permits states and their allies to defend themselves until the international help arrives pursuant to Chapter VII.\n202\nAlexandru Nitu\nArticle 51 restricts a state's right of self-defense to situations involving 'armed attack', a narrower category of act than Article 2(4)'s 'use of force'. Although coercion not involving armed force may violate Article 2(4) and result in action under Article 39, it does not follow that states may also react unilaterally pursuant to Article 51. This narrowing plainly reflects the Charter's preference for community responses over individual ones, even to threats to peace (Schmitt 1999). In the case of a IW attack, it is also a prudent approach due to the difficulty states may have in identifying the correct source of an attack.\nThe main problem IW poses for Article 2(4) does not derive from its large-scale applications, but from attacks that do not destroy life or property, such as subversion of property, electronic blockades, and incursions. The large-scale attacks are similar to conventional methods of warfare and fit comfortably within traditional use of force analysis. The lower-level attacks present the problem when analyzed under Article 2(4) because they threaten to erase the distinction between acts of force and acts of coercion. The severity of an IW attack might not be identified promptly, so it would not be feasible to require a victim to conduct a damage assessment to determine whether an IW penetration were a use of force or merely of coercion. (Barkham 2001)\n## 3. International legal limits on IW\n### 3.1 Limits on the use of weapons\nMany of the international legal provisions regarding armed conflicts are found in the 1949 Geneva Conventions and the 1977 Additional Protocols to the Geneva Conventions. The Geneva Conventions, with their focus on the protection of persons in enemy hands, are of some relevance to IW. Without reference to specific weapons, the Additional Protocols (AP) address various methods and means of warfare in general terms, thus being able to present a framework for the use of IW.\nIn order for International Humanitarian Law (IHL) to apply to a particular armed conflict, neither formal declaration of war, nor recognition of a state of war is required. Instead, the requirements of the law become applicable as from the actual opening of hostilities. An international armed conflict is perceived as any difference arising between two States and leading to the intervention of armed forces, even if one of the Parties denies the existence of a state of war (Pictet 1952).\nThere is no doubt that an armed conflict exists and IHL applies once traditional kinetic weapons are used in combination with new methods of IW. The most difficult situation, as far as applicability of IHL is concerned, would be the one where the first, or the only hostile acts are conducted by means of IW. The question is if this type of conflict depends on the type of attack in order to be qualified as constituting an armed conflict within the meaning of the 1949 Geneva Convention and the Additional Protocols.\nSame as in the U.N. Charter's case, the fact that IW developed only after the adoption of the Protocols does not exclude their applicability. The first Additional Protocol to the Geneva Conventions made specific reference for consideration of new weapons. Article 36 of Additional Protocol I (AP I) is a strong indicator that the drafters of AP I anticipated the application of its rules to new developments of methods and means of warfare. This provision requires that 'In the study, development, acquisition or adoption of a new weapon, means or method of warfare, a High Contracting Party is under an obligation to determine whether its employment would, in some or all circumstances, be prohibited by this Protocol or by any other rule of international law applicable to the High Contracting Party' (Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions 1977). This statement obligates a nation at least to consider the laws of armed conflict before employing IW means. That consideration should focus on both the means of force and perhaps more importantly on the effects.\nConsequently, the fact that a particular military activity constituting a method of warfare is not specifically regulated does not mean that it can be used without restrictions. Based on that, nothing precludes assuming that the more recent forms of IW, which do not involve the use of traditional weapons, are subject to IHL just as any new weapon or delivery system has been so far when used in an armed conflict. (Dörmann 2004)\nAnother fundamental rule of warfare, found in Article 35 (1) of AP I, states that 'the right of the Parties to the conflict to choose methods or means of warfare is not unlimited' (Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions 1977). So far, hostilities have involved physical violence and kinetic energy\n203\nAlexandru Nitu\nleading to human casualties or material damage. In the case of IHL, the motivation for the application of the law is to limit the damage and provide care for the casualties. This would support an expansive interpretation of when IHL begins to apply. If a cyber attack is directed against an enemy in order to cause physical damage or loss of life, it can hardly be disputed that such an attack is in fact a method of warfare and is subject to limitations under IHL. (Dörmann 2004)\n## 3.2 The principle of distinction\nJust as information warfare attacks may be difficult to encompass within the 'use of force' concept, it may be also difficult to define their targets as military (and thus generally legitimate targets) or civilian (generally forbidden). The dual-use nature of many telecommunications networks complicates the questions of the applicability of IHL as a constraint on information warfare, because the intangible damage that cyber attacks cause may not be the sort of injuries against which the humanitarian law of war is designed to protect noncombatants. (Greenberg 1998)\nThe definition of the term \"attack\" is of decisive importance for the application of the various rules giving effect to the principle of distinction and for most of the rules providing special protection for certain objects. In accordance with Art. 49 (1) of AP I, 'attacks' means acts of violence against the adversary, whether in offence or in defense (Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions 1977). If the term 'acts of violence' denotes only physical force, the concept of 'attacks' excludes dissemination of propaganda, embargoes or other non-physical means of psychological, political or economic warfare. (Dörmann 2004)\nBased on that understanding and distinction, cyber attacks through viruses, worms, logic bombs etc. that result in physical damage to persons, or damage to objects that goes beyond the computer program or data attacked can be qualified as 'acts of violence' and thus as an attack in the sense of IHL. From this point of view, it is helpful to look at how the concept of attack is applied to other means and methods of warfare. There is general agreement that, for example, the employment of biological or chemical agents that does not cause a physical explosion, such as the use of asphyxiating or poisonous gases, would constitute an attack (Dörmann 2004).\nIf one admits that employing a IW method constitute an attack, AP I imposes:\n- The obligation to direct attacks only against \"military objectives\" and not to attack civilians or civilian objects; (Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions 1977, Art. 48, 51 (2), 52)\n- The prohibition of indiscriminate attacks, including attacks that may be expected to cause excessive incidental civilian casualties or damages; (Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions 1977, Art. 51 (4), (5))\n- The requirement to take the necessary precautions to ensure that the previous two rules are respected, (Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions 1977, Art. 57) in particular the requirement to minimize incidental civilian damage and the obligation to abstain from attacks if such damage is likely to be excessive to the value of the military objective to be attacked; (Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions 1977, Art. 51 (5)(b), 57 (2)(a)(ii) and (iii))\nThese rules operate in exactly the same way whether the attack is carried out using traditional weapons or IW techniques. Problems that arise in applying these rules are therefore not necessarily unique to IW. They are more related to the interpretation of, for example, what constitutes a military objective or which collateral damage would be excessive.\n## 4. Legal perspectives on IW\nThe laws of war always faced two challenges. The first was that war's confrontational nature and tremendously high stakes often frustrated efforts to set reasonable limits on behavior. Fortunately, the international community has generated international conventions and war crimes tribunals to solve this problem.\nThe laws of war also face a second challenge, which is how to adapt these laws to technological change. This dynamic itself is as old as civilization, but it became more acute in the last one hundred years, since technological progress has accelerated. The result is that weapons are developing much faster than international law, and there is every reason to believe that this trend will continue to accelerate in the future.\n204\nAlexandru Nitu\nAs IW strategy and technology evolve, international law scholars will have to fit this new kind of warfare into an analytical framework developed to address a different conception of war.\nFirst, the U.N. Charter and other existing treaty regimes do not create a clear legal prohibition of many types of IW attacks. For international law effectively to address IW attacks there must be established a correspondence between terms like ‘use of force’, ‘armed attack’ or ‘armed aggression’ and IW methods and means of combat. Also, it would be necessary to set limits to IW activities similar to the classic *jus in bello* principles, like just war, discrimination or proportionality.\nThe second, and the more difficult part, is to find a way to solve the practical problems associated with both launching and defending against cyber attacks, including the fundamental issue of attribution and in particular state responsibility for cyber attacks. It is technically challenging to localize the physical place from which such an act originates. But even if the origin of an attack can be localized within a particular state, it would be challenging to determine whether the attacker was acting in an individual capacity, or on behalf of a criminal organization, the government or armed forces.\nJust as the identity of the attacker raises difficult questions for any potential IW treaty, so does the identity of the victim.

In the physical world, some of these facilities (such as hospitals) display a distinctive sign, indicating their protected status. Such identifying signs are absent in cyberspace, nor do criteria exist for designating these systems as critical infrastructure.\n## 5.

This absence of prohibitions is significant because, as a crudely general rule, that which international law does not prohibit it permits. But the absence is not dispositive, because even where international law does not address particular weapons or technologies, its general principles may apply to the use of those weapons and technologies (Greenberg 1998).\nAlthough the existing body of international law does not necessarily provide definitive and universally accepted answers to the legal issues that Information Warfare development rises, it does provide a structure by which these issues could be addressed and analyzed.

It could give states and their militaries a clear sense of the rules of engagement in the information age.\nA dedicated law would allow states not simply to choose among available interpretations of the prohibition on the use of force, but to craft a standard tailored to IW without the additional inclusion problems that currently exist. Similarly, states could set the bar for when IW triggers the civilian distinction requirement and address whether any or all information networks constitute legitimate military objectives.\nDisclaimer: The views, opinions, and recommendations contained in this analysis are those of the author and should not be construed as an official position, policy, or decision of the Romanian Intelligence Service\n205\nAlexandru Nitu"

Individuals, societies and states depend on the stability and reliability of the information infrastructure.\nComputers and computer networks have become increasingly integral to government, military, and civilian functions. They allow instant communication and provide platforms on which business and government alike can operate. Computers now control both military and civilian infrastructures, including nuclear arsenals, telecommunication networks, electrical power systems, water supplies, oil storage facilities, financial systems, and emergency services.\nAs the worldwide explosion of information technology (IT) is changing the ways that business, government, and education are conducted, it also promises to change the way wars are waged. The development of information technology makes it possible for adversaries to attack each other in new ways and to inflict new forms of damage, and may create new targets for attack. Attackers may use international networks to damage or disrupt enemy systems, without ever physically entering the enemy's country.\nInformation technologies enable a fundamentally new and effective means to disrupt or destroy a country's industry, its economy, social infrastructure and public administration. They have the potential to be a means of combat capable of achieving goals related to inter-state confrontation at the tactical, operational and strategic levels. Whatever the development and diffusion of information technology mean for the future of warfare, it is apparent that many of the new forms of attack that information technology enables are qualitatively different from prior forms of attack. The use of such tools as computer intrusion and computer viruses, for example, take war out of the physical, kinetic\n200\nAlexandru Nitu\nworld and bring it into an intangible, electronic one. Effects previously attainable only through physical destruction are now accomplished remotely with the silent means of information technology.\nThese new ways of fighting have been labeled Information Warfare (IW). Definitions and conceptions of IW are numerous, but generally entail preserving one's own information and information technology while exploiting, disrupting, or denying the use of an adversary's (Shackelford 2009). In US military doctrine, IW it is part of a much larger strategic shift that was named Information Operations (IO). Information Operations involve actions taken to affect adversary information and information systems while defending one's own information and information systems. Information Operations apply across all phases of an operation, throughout the range of military operations, and at every level of war. Information Warfare is Information Operations conducted during time of crisis or conflict, including war, to achieve or promote specific objectives over a specific adversary or adversaries (Joint Chiefs of Staff 1998).\nThe new emerging vulnerabilities that information age generates are more likely to be exploited by opponents of developed states that cannot hope to prevail on the battlefield, or even at the negotiations table. A lesser-advantaged state hoping to seriously harm a dominant adversary must inevitably compete asymmetrically. It must seek to counter the strengths of the opponent not head-on, but rather employing unorthodox means to strike at centers of gravity.\nIW offers such asymmetrical benefits. In the first place, in many cases a computer network attack will either not merit a response involving the use of force, or the legality of such a response could be debatable, even if the victim is able to accurately identify the attack and its source. Thus, because of the potentially grave impact of cyber attacks on a state's infrastructure, it can prove a high gain, low risk option for a state outclassed militarily or economically. Moreover, to the extent that an opponent is militarily and economically advantaged, it is probably technologically dependent, and, therefore, teeming with tempting targets.\n## 2. IW and the 'use of force' concept\nSeveral rules govern when force can be used (the jus ad bellum, which focuses on the criteria for going to war, covering issues such as right purpose, duly constituted authority, last resort) and how states can use that force in an armed conflict (the jus in bello or 'law of war', that creates the concept of just war-fighting, covering discrimination, proportionality, humanity etc). These rules have diverse sources, including the U.N. Charter, international humanitarian law treaties, including the 1949 Geneva Conventions, as well as customary international humanitarian law. Some of these existing laws involve principles of general applicability that could encompass IW. Nevertheless, the gap between physical weaponry (whether kinetic, biological, or chemical) and IW's virtual methods can be substantial, creating translation problems.\nThe sort of intangible damage that IW attacks may cause is analytically different from the physical damage caused by the use of armed force in traditional warfare. The kind of destruction that bombs and bullets cause is easy to see and understand, and fits well within longstanding views of what war means. In contrast, the disruption of information systems, including the corruption or manipulation of stored or transmitted data, may cause intangible damage, such as disruption of civil society or government services. These may be more closely equivalent to activities such as economic sanctions that may be undertaken in times of peace rather than acts of aggression (Greenberg 1998).\nWhether or not an information warfare attack can be considered 'use of force' or 'aggression' is relevant to the fact that a forceful response can be justified as self-defense, as well as to the issue of whether a particular response would be proportionate to the original attack.\nModern law on the use of force is based on the U.N. Charter. An analysis of international law and IW could begin with the prohibition of the use of force in Article 2(4): 'All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations' (Charter of the United Nations, Art.2(4)). The drafters intended to prohibit all types of force, except those carried out under the aegis of the United Nations or as provided for by the Security Council, and wanted to restrict the use of force severely by sharply limiting its use to situations approved by the Security Council (Barkham 2001).\n201\nAlexandru Nitu\nThe fact is that neither the Charter nor any international body has defined the term ‘use of force’ clearly. That might be the main reason why the use of force prohibition encounters difficulty when translated into the IW context. Not all hostile acts are uses of force. Traditionally, states defined ‘force’ in terms of the instrument used, including ‘armed’ force within the prohibition, but excluding economic and political forms of coercion. This distinction reflects an effort to proscribe those acts most likely to interfere with the U.N.’s primary purpose: maintaining international peace and security.\nThe classic ‘instrumentality’ approach argues that IW does not qualify as armed force because it lacks the physical characteristics associated with military coercion (Hollis 2007). The analysis looks at whether there is kinetic impact: some type of explosion or physical force. The Charter was created in the days of weapons that provided blast, heat, and fragmentation damage, so it is clear that these types of kinetic weapons were exclusively present in the minds of the drafters.\nStill, some types of cyber attacks can be determined to be uses of force. Since the determination of a use of force requires that a weapon be used, there first must be a method of analogizing IW attacks to weapons. A very good method could be the one proposed by Ian Brownlie, which shifts the traditional use of force analysis from a purely kinetic analysis, based on physical force being applied to the target, to a result-based analysis, evaluating IW attacks is not limited to focusing on the method of the attack (Brownlie 1963). A result-based analysis requires looking at whether there is a kinetic result, that cause damage or injury, rather than whether the weapon itself is kinetic.\nThe text of the U.N. Charter offers additional support for the ‘instrumentality’ view in Article 41, which states that ‘measures not involving the use of armed force’ include ‘complete or partial interruption of (...) telegraphic, radio, and other means of communication’ (Charter of the United Nations, Art.41). Clearly, ‘other means of communications’ fairly encompasses computer communications and communication over computer networks. It seems that Article 41 permits countries to deprive another nation of its communications, as well as interrupting communications by manipulation of the target country's data such that it is corrupt and untrustworthy, altering the data to render it useless for that nation's purpose, and actually altering the data such that it achieves an intended purpose for the aggressor nation (DiCenso 2000). Although such measures sound like fair game for IW, the provisions of Article 41 still require the Security Council to decide what measures are to be employed under that article, including force and actions that do not include armed force.\nIn order to retain its effectiveness, the Charter’s interpretations must evolve to some degree. The extent to which this happens is important in applying use of force analysis under Article 2(4) as new types of warfare develop. If the definition of the ‘use of force’ is static, then the ban on the use of force gradually will become less effective as new interstate actions occur beyond the boundaries of what the drafters considered (Barkham 2001).\nDifficulty in characterizing certain forms of information warfare as ‘force’ or ‘aggression’ under international law does not mean that international legal institutions cannot respond to such attacks. For example, Chapter VII of the U.N. Charter gives the UN Security Council the authority and responsibility to determine the existence of any ‘threat to the peace’ or acts of aggression (Charter of the United Nations, Article 39) and the Council can recommend and lead responses to that (Charter of the United Nations, Article 40). Many information attacks that may not constitute ‘force’ or ‘aggression’ could certainly be considered threats to the peace and thus subject to Security Council action, perhaps including the use of military force. After all, anything that would anger a government to the point that it might feel the need to resort to military action could thus threaten the peace, even if the provocative action was not technically illegal (Greenberg 1998).\nOf particular interest for IW analysis is Article 51 of the U.N. Charter, the only exception to the rule stated in Article 2(4). According to Article 51, states can use force pursuant to the inherent right of self-defense in response to an armed attack: ‘Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defense if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security’ (Charter of the United Nations, Art.51). As sole authorization of unilateral use of force outside the U.N. Charter security system, this provision responds to the reality that the international community may not be able to react quickly enough to armed aggression to forestall attack on a victim state. It therefore permits states and their allies to defend themselves until the international help arrives pursuant to Chapter VII.\n202\nAlexandru Nitu\nArticle 51 restricts a state's right of self-defense to situations involving 'armed attack', a narrower category of act than Article 2(4)'s 'use of force'. Although coercion not involving armed force may violate Article 2(4) and result in action under Article 39, it does not follow that states may also react unilaterally pursuant to Article 51. This narrowing plainly reflects the Charter's preference for community responses over individual ones, even to threats to peace (Schmitt 1999). In the case of a IW attack, it is also a prudent approach due to the difficulty states may have in identifying the correct source of an attack.\nThe main problem IW poses for Article 2(4) does not derive from its large-scale applications, but from attacks that do not destroy life or property, such as subversion of property, electronic blockades, and incursions. The large-scale attacks are similar to conventional methods of warfare and fit comfortably within traditional use of force analysis. The lower-level attacks present the problem when analyzed under Article 2(4) because they threaten to erase the distinction between acts of force and acts of coercion. The severity of an IW attack might not be identified promptly, so it would not be feasible to require a victim to conduct a damage assessment to determine whether an IW penetration were a use of force or merely of coercion. (Barkham 2001)\n## 3. International legal limits on IW\n### 3.1 Limits on the use of weapons\nMany of the international legal provisions regarding armed conflicts are found in the 1949 Geneva Conventions and the 1977 Additional Protocols to the Geneva Conventions. The Geneva Conventions, with their focus on the protection of persons in enemy hands, are of some relevance to IW. Without reference to specific weapons, the Additional Protocols (AP) address various methods and means of warfare in general terms, thus being able to present a framework for the use of IW.\nIn order for International Humanitarian Law (IHL) to apply to a particular armed conflict, neither formal declaration of war, nor recognition of a state of war is required. Instead, the requirements of the law become applicable as from the actual opening of hostilities. An international armed conflict is perceived as any difference arising between two States and leading to the intervention of armed forces, even if one of the Parties denies the existence of a state of war (Pictet 1952).\nThere is no doubt that an armed conflict exists and IHL applies once traditional kinetic weapons are used in combination with new methods of IW. The most difficult situation, as far as applicability of IHL is concerned, would be the one where the first, or the only hostile acts are conducted by means of IW. The question is if this type of conflict depends on the type of attack in order to be qualified as constituting an armed conflict within the meaning of the 1949 Geneva Convention and the Additional Protocols.\nSame as in the U.N. Charter's case, the fact that IW developed only after the adoption of the Protocols does not exclude their applicability. The first Additional Protocol to the Geneva Conventions made specific reference for consideration of new weapons. Article 36 of Additional Protocol I (AP I) is a strong indicator that the drafters of AP I anticipated the application of its rules to new developments of methods and means of warfare. This provision requires that 'In the study, development, acquisition or adoption of a new weapon, means or method of warfare, a High Contracting Party is under an obligation to determine whether its employment would, in some or all circumstances, be prohibited by this Protocol or by any other rule of international law applicable to the High Contracting Party' (Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions 1977). This statement obligates a nation at least to consider the laws of armed conflict before employing IW means. That consideration should focus on both the means of force and perhaps more importantly on the effects.\nConsequently, the fact that a particular military activity constituting a method of warfare is not specifically regulated does not mean that it can be used without restrictions. Based on that, nothing precludes assuming that the more recent forms of IW, which do not involve the use of traditional weapons, are subject to IHL just as any new weapon or delivery system has been so far when used in an armed conflict. (Dörmann 2004)\nAnother fundamental rule of warfare, found in Article 35 (1) of AP I, states that 'the right of the Parties to the conflict to choose methods or means of warfare is not unlimited' (Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions 1977). So far, hostilities have involved physical violence and kinetic energy\n203\nAlexandru Nitu\nleading to human casualties or material damage. In the case of IHL, the motivation for the application of the law is to limit the damage and provide care for the casualties. This would support an expansive interpretation of when IHL begins to apply. If a cyber attack is directed against an enemy in order to cause physical damage or loss of life, it can hardly be disputed that such an attack is in fact a method of warfare and is subject to limitations under IHL. (Dörmann 2004)\n## 3.2 The principle of distinction\nJust as information warfare attacks may be difficult to encompass within the 'use of force' concept, it may be also difficult to define their targets as military (and thus generally legitimate targets) or civilian (generally forbidden). The dual-use nature of many telecommunications networks complicates the questions of the applicability of IHL as a constraint on information warfare, because the intangible damage that cyber attacks cause may not be the sort of injuries against which the humanitarian law of war is designed to protect noncombatants. (Greenberg 1998)\nThe definition of the term \"attack\" is of decisive importance for the application of the various rules giving effect to the principle of distinction and for most of the rules providing special protection for certain objects. In accordance with Art. 49 (1) of AP I, 'attacks' means acts of violence against the adversary, whether in offence or in defense (Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions 1977). If the term 'acts of violence' denotes only physical force, the concept of 'attacks' excludes dissemination of propaganda, embargoes or other non-physical means of psychological, political or economic warfare. (Dörmann 2004)\nBased on that understanding and distinction, cyber attacks through viruses, worms, logic bombs etc. that result in physical damage to persons, or damage to objects that goes beyond the computer program or data attacked can be qualified as 'acts of violence' and thus as an attack in the sense of IHL. From this point of view, it is helpful to look at how the concept of attack is applied to other means and methods of warfare. There is general agreement that, for example, the employment of biological or chemical agents that does not cause a physical explosion, such as the use of asphyxiating or poisonous gases, would constitute an attack (Dörmann 2004).\nIf one admits that employing a IW method constitute an attack, AP I imposes:\n- The obligation to direct attacks only against \"military objectives\" and not to attack civilians or civilian objects; (Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions 1977, Art. 48, 51 (2), 52)\n- The prohibition of indiscriminate attacks, including attacks that may be expected to cause excessive incidental civilian casualties or damages; (Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions 1977, Art. 51 (4), (5))\n- The requirement to take the necessary precautions to ensure that the previous two rules are respected, (Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions 1977, Art. 57) in particular the requirement to minimize incidental civilian damage and the obligation to abstain from attacks if such damage is likely to be excessive to the value of the military objective to be attacked; (Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions 1977, Art. 51 (5)(b), 57 (2)(a)(ii) and (iii))\nThese rules operate in exactly the same way whether the attack is carried out using traditional weapons or IW techniques. Problems that arise in applying these rules are therefore not necessarily unique to IW. They are more related to the interpretation of, for example, what constitutes a military objective or which collateral damage would be excessive.\n## 4. Legal perspectives on IW\nThe laws of war always faced two challenges. The first was that war's confrontational nature and tremendously high stakes often frustrated efforts to set reasonable limits on behavior. Fortunately, the international community has generated international conventions and war crimes tribunals to solve this problem.\nThe laws of war also face a second challenge, which is how to adapt these laws to technological change. This dynamic itself is as old as civilization, but it became more acute in the last one hundred years, since technological progress has accelerated. The result is that weapons are developing much faster than international law, and there is every reason to believe that this trend will continue to accelerate in the future.\n204\nAlexandru Nitu\nAs IW strategy and technology evolve, international law scholars will have to fit this new kind of warfare into an analytical framework developed to address a different conception of war.\nFirst, the U.N. Charter and other existing treaty regimes do not create a clear legal prohibition of many types of IW attacks. For international law effectively to address IW attacks there must be established a correspondence between terms like ‘use of force’, ‘armed attack’ or ‘armed aggression’ and IW methods and means of combat. Also, it would be necessary to set limits to IW activities similar to the classic *jus in bello* principles, like just war, discrimination or proportionality.\nThe second, and the more difficult part, is to find a way to solve the practical problems associated with both launching and defending against cyber attacks, including the fundamental issue of attribution and in particular state responsibility for cyber attacks. It is technically challenging to localize the physical place from which such an act originates. But even if the origin of an attack can be localized within a particular state, it would be challenging to determine whether the attacker was acting in an individual capacity, or on behalf of a criminal organization, the government or armed forces.\nJust as the identity of the attacker raises difficult questions for any potential IW treaty, so does the identity of the victim. In an IW context, it becomes necessary to ask whether an attack on a company or an institution is an attack on a whole country. It is not necessarily clear that the state in whose territory the injured party resides is the injured state. In a conventional attack, the country where the attack is located has been attacked because its territorial integrity has been violated, but cyberspace is not a customary arena over which states may exercise such control.\nFrom a humanitarian law perspective, it would be essential to be able to ‘mark’ in some way the information systems used to maintain the viability of critical social infrastructure facilities. In the physical world, some of these facilities (such as hospitals) display a distinctive sign, indicating their protected status. Such identifying signs are absent in cyberspace, nor do criteria exist for designating these systems as critical infrastructure.\n## 5. Conclusions\nBecause of the newness of much of the technology involved, no provision of international law explicitly addresses to information warfare. This absence of prohibitions is significant because, as a crudely general rule, that which international law does not prohibit it permits. But the absence is not dispositive, because even where international law does not address particular weapons or technologies, its general principles may apply to the use of those weapons and technologies (Greenberg 1998).\nAlthough the existing body of international law does not necessarily provide definitive and universally accepted answers to the legal issues that Information Warfare development rises, it does provide a structure by which these issues could be addressed and analyzed. However, in order to apply existent norms to IW, it is necessary to accept the consequence-based interpretations of “armed conflict” and “attack”. In the absence of such understandings, the applicability, and therefore adequacy, of present-day humanitarian law principles would come into question. The consideration of IW in the context of *jus ad bellum* also leads to consequence-based interpretation.\nDevising a system of international law addressing Information Warfare or Information Operations could rectify many of the deficiencies of the current legal system and provide states with additional functional benefits that do not currently exist. First, it can remedy uncertainty. Drafting new rules provides an opportunity to rectify translation problems that plague IW under the law of war. It could give states and their militaries a clear sense of the rules of engagement in the information age.\nA dedicated law would allow states not simply to choose among available interpretations of the prohibition on the use of force, but to craft a standard tailored to IW without the additional inclusion problems that currently exist. Similarly, states could set the bar for when IW triggers the civilian distinction requirement and address whether any or all information networks constitute legitimate military objectives.\nDisclaimer: The views, opinions, and recommendations contained in this analysis are those of the author and should not be construed as an official position, policy, or decision of the Romanian Intelligence Service\n205\nAlexandru Nitu"

At the same time, states' military and intelligence organizations are increasingly developing the capability to attack and defend computer systems. The progress of information technology makes it possible for adversaries to attack each other in new ways, inflicting new forms of damage; technological change enables cyberwarfare acts that do not fit within existing legal categories, or may reveal contradictions among existing legal principles. The paper examines the relationship between information warfare and the law, especially international law and the law of war, as it is apparent that some fundamental questions regarding this new and emerging type of security threat need to be explored. For example, what types of activities between nation states, could or should be called information warfare? What are 'force', 'armed attack', or 'armed aggression' - terms from the UN Charter - in the Information Age, and do they equate to information warfare? Information warfare is neither 'armed' in the traditional sense, nor does it necessarily involve conflict, so an important issue is if 'war' between states necessarily require physical violence, kinetic energy, and human casualties. A threshold question that arises from the development of information warfare techniques is thus the definitional one: has the development of information warfare technology and techniques taken information warfare out of the existing legal definition of war? Characteristics of information technology and warfare pose problems to those who would use international law to limit information warfare, and leave legal space for those who would wage such warfare. Consequently, there may be confusion over what limits may apply to the conduct of information warfare, and when information warfare attacks may be carried out. Prospects of new technological attacks pose problems for international law because law is inherently conservative. From this point of view, the paper examines how the law itself might change in response to the fast development of information technology and how will long-established legal principles such as national sovereignty and the inviolability of national borders be affected by the ability of cyberspace to transcend such concepts.\nKeywords: international law, information warfare, use of force, Charter of the United Nations, Geneva conventions Intensive development of information and communication technologies and their wide use in all spheres of human activity have accelerated post-industrial development and the building of a global information society, becoming a driving force for social development. The global information infrastructure provides unprecedented opportunities for communication among people, their socialization and access to information. Individuals, societies and states depend on the stability and reliability of the information infrastructure.\nComputers and computer networks have become increasingly integral to government, military, and civilian functions. They allow instant communication and provide platforms on which business and government alike can operate. Computers now control both military and civilian infrastructures, including nuclear arsenals, telecommunication networks, electrical power systems, water supplies, oil storage facilities, financial systems, and emergency services.\nAs the worldwide explosion of information technology (IT) is changing the ways that business, government, and education are conducted, it also promises to change the way wars are waged. The development of information technology makes it possible for adversaries to attack each other in new ways and to inflict new forms of damage, and may create new targets for attack. Attackers may use international networks to damage or disrupt enemy systems, without ever physically entering the enemy's country.\nInformation technologies enable a fundamentally new and effective means to disrupt or destroy a country's industry, its economy, social infrastructure and public administration. They have the potential to be a means of combat capable of achieving goals related to inter-state confrontation at the tactical, operational and strategic levels. Whatever the development and diffusion of information technology mean for the future of warfare, it is apparent that many of the new forms of attack that information technology enables are qualitatively different from prior forms of attack. The use of such tools as computer intrusion and computer viruses, for example, take war out of the physical, kinetic world and bring it into an intangible, electronic one. Effects previously attainable only through physical destruction are now accomplished remotely with the silent means of information technology.\nThese new ways of fighting have been labeled Information Warfare (IW). Definitions and conceptions of IW are numerous, but generally entail preserving one's own information and information technology while exploiting, disrupting, or denying the use of an adversary's. In US military doctrine, IW it is part of a much larger strategic shift that was named Information Operations (IO). Information Operations involve actions taken to affect adversary information and information systems while defending one's own information and information systems. Information Operations apply across all phases of an operation, throughout the range of military operations, and at every level of war. Information Warfare is Information Operations conducted during time of crisis or conflict, including war, to achieve or promote specific objectives over a specific adversary or adversaries (Joint Chiefs of Staff 1998).\nThe new emerging vulnerabilities that information age generates are more likely to be exploited by opponents of developed states that cannot hope to prevail on the battlefield, or even at the negotiations table. A lesser-advantaged state hoping to seriously harm a dominant adversary must inevitably compete asymmetrically. It must seek to counter the strengths of the opponent not head-on, but rather employing unorthodox means to strike at centers of gravity.\nIW offers such asymmetrical benefits. In the first place, in many cases a computer network attack will either not merit a response involving the use of force, or the legality of such a response could be debatable, even if the victim is able to accurately identify the attack and its source. Thus, because of the potentially grave impact of cyber attacks on a state's infrastructure, it can prove a high gain, low risk option for a state outclassed militarily or economically. Moreover, to the extent that an opponent is militarily and economically advantaged, it is probably technologically dependent, and, therefore, teeming with tempting targets.\n## 2. IW and the 'use of force' concept Several rules govern when force can be used (the jus ad bellum, which focuses on the criteria for going to war, covering issues such as right purpose, duly constituted authority, last resort) and how states can use that force in an armed conflict (the jus in bello or 'law of war', that creates the concept of just war-fighting, covering discrimination, proportionality, humanity etc). These rules have diverse sources, including the U.N. Charter, international humanitarian law treaties, including the 1949 Geneva Conventions, as well as customary international humanitarian law. Some of these existing laws involve principles of general applicability that could encompass IW. Nevertheless, the gap between physical weaponry (whether kinetic, biological, or chemical) and IW's virtual methods can be substantial, creating translation problems.\nThe sort of intangible damage that IW attacks may cause is analytically different from the physical damage caused by the use of armed force in traditional warfare. The kind of destruction that bombs and bullets cause is easy to see and understand, and fits well within longstanding views of what war means. In contrast, the disruption of information systems, including the corruption or manipulation of stored or transmitted data, may cause intangible damage, such as disruption of civil society or government services. These may be more closely equivalent to activities such as economic sanctions that may be undertaken in times of peace rather than acts of aggression.\nWhether or not an information warfare attack can be considered 'use of force' or 'aggression' is relevant to the fact that a forceful response can be justified as self-defense, as well as to the issue of whether a particular response would be proportionate to the original attack.\nModern law on the use of force is based on the U.N. Charter. An analysis of international law and IW could begin with the prohibition of the use of force in Article 2(4): 'All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations' (Charter of the United Nations, Art.2(4)). The drafters intended to prohibit all types of force, except those carried out under the aegis of the United Nations or as provided for by the Security Council, and wanted to restrict the use of force severely by sharply limiting its use to situations approved by the Security Council.\n\nThe fact is that neither the Charter nor any international body has defined the term ‘use of force’ clearly. That might be the main reason why the use of force prohibition encounters difficulty when translated into the IW context. Not all hostile acts are uses of force. Traditionally, states defined ‘force’ in terms of the instrument used, including ‘armed’ force within the prohibition, but excluding economic and political forms of coercion. This distinction reflects an effort to proscribe those acts most likely to interfere with the U.N.’s primary purpose: maintaining international peace and security.\nThe classic ‘instrumentality’ approach argues that IW does not qualify as armed force because it lacks the physical characteristics associated with military coercion. The analysis looks at whether there is kinetic impact: some type of explosion or physical force. The Charter was created in the days of weapons that provided blast, heat, and fragmentation damage, so it is clear that these types of kinetic weapons were exclusively present in the minds of the drafters.\nStill, some types of cyber attacks can be determined to be uses of force. Since the determination of a use of force requires that a weapon be used, there first must be a method of analogizing IW attacks to weapons. A very good method could be the one proposed by Ian Brownlie, which shifts the traditional use of force analysis from a purely kinetic analysis, based on physical force being applied to the target, to a result-based analysis, evaluating IW attacks is not limited to focusing on the method of the attack. A result-based analysis requires looking at whether there is a kinetic result, that cause damage or injury, rather than whether the weapon itself is kinetic.\nThe text of the U.N. Charter offers additional support for the ‘instrumentality’ view in Article 41, which states that ‘measures not involving the use of armed force’ include ‘complete or partial interruption of (...) telegraphic, radio, and other means of communication’ (Charter of the United Nations, Art.41). Clearly, ‘other means of communications’ fairly encompasses computer communications and communication over computer networks. It seems that Article 41 permits countries to deprive another nation of its communications, as well as interrupting communications by manipulation of the target country's data such that it is corrupt and untrustworthy, altering the data to render it useless for that nation's purpose, and actually altering the data such that it achieves an intended purpose for the aggressor nation. Although such measures sound like fair game for IW, the provisions of Article 41 still require the Security Council to decide what measures are to be employed under that article, including force and actions that do not include armed force.\nIn order to retain its effectiveness, the Charter’s interpretations must evolve to some degree. The extent to which this happens is important in applying use of force analysis under Article 2(4) as new types of warfare develop. If the definition of the ‘use of force’ is static, then the ban on the use of force gradually will become less effective as new interstate actions occur beyond the boundaries of what the drafters considered.\nDifficulty in characterizing certain forms of information warfare as ‘force’ or ‘aggression’ under international law does not mean that international legal institutions cannot respond to such attacks. For example, Chapter VII of the U.N. Charter gives the UN Security Council the authority and responsibility to determine the existence of any ‘threat to the peace’ or acts of aggression (Charter of the United Nations, Article 39) and the Council can recommend and lead responses to that (Charter of the United Nations, Article 40). Many information attacks that may not constitute ‘force’ or ‘aggression’ could certainly be considered threats to the peace and thus subject to Security Council action, perhaps including the use of military force. After all, anything that would anger a government to the point that it might feel the need to resort to military action could thus threaten the peace, even if the provocative action was not technically illegal.\nOf particular interest for IW analysis is Article 51 of the U.N. Charter, the only exception to the rule stated in Article 2(4). According to Article 51, states can use force pursuant to the inherent right of self-defense in response to an armed attack: ‘Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defense if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security’ (Charter of the United Nations, Art.51). As sole authorization of unilateral use of force outside the U.N. Charter security system, this provision responds to the reality that the international community may not be able to react quickly enough to armed aggression to forestall attack on a victim state. It therefore permits states and their allies to defend themselves until the international help arrives pursuant to Chapter VII.\n\nArticle 51 restricts a state's right of self-defense to situations involving 'armed attack', a narrower category of act than Article 2(4)'s 'use of force'. Although coercion not involving armed force may violate Article 2(4) and result in action under Article 39, it does not follow that states may also react unilaterally pursuant to Article 51. This narrowing plainly reflects the Charter's preference for community responses over individual ones, even to threats to peace. In the case of a IW attack, it is also a prudent approach due to the difficulty states may have in identifying the correct source of an attack.\nThe main problem IW poses for Article 2(4) does not derive from its large-scale applications, but from attacks that do not destroy life or property, such as subversion of property, electronic blockades, and incursions. The large-scale attacks are similar to conventional methods of warfare and fit comfortably within traditional use of force analysis. The lower-level attacks present the problem when analyzed under Article 2(4) because they threaten to erase the distinction between acts of force and acts of coercion. The severity of an IW attack might not be identified promptly, so it would not be feasible to require a victim to conduct a damage assessment to determine whether an IW penetration were a use of force or merely of coercion. ## 3. International legal limits on IW ### 3.1 Limits on the use of weapons Many of the international legal provisions regarding armed conflicts are found in the 1949 Geneva Conventions and the 1977 Additional Protocols to the Geneva Conventions. The Geneva Conventions, with their focus on the protection of persons in enemy hands, are of some relevance to IW. Without reference to specific weapons, the Additional Protocols (AP) address various methods and means of warfare in general terms, thus being able to present a framework for the use of IW.\nIn order for International Humanitarian Law (IHL) to apply to a particular armed conflict, neither formal declaration of war, nor recognition of a state of war is required. Instead, the requirements of the law become applicable as from the actual opening of hostilities. An international armed conflict is perceived as any difference arising between two States and leading to the intervention of armed forces, even if one of the Parties denies the existence of a state of war.\nThere is no doubt that an armed conflict exists and IHL applies once traditional kinetic weapons are used in combination with new methods of IW. The most difficult situation, as far as applicability of IHL is concerned, would be the one where the first, or the only hostile acts are conducted by means of IW. The question is if this type of conflict depends on the type of attack in order to be qualified as constituting an armed conflict within the meaning of the 1949 Geneva Convention and the Additional Protocols.\nSame as in the U.N. Charter's case, the fact that IW developed only after the adoption of the Protocols does not exclude their applicability. The first Additional Protocol to the Geneva Conventions made specific reference for consideration of new weapons. Article 36 of Additional Protocol I (AP I) is a strong indicator that the drafters of AP I anticipated the application of its rules to new developments of methods and means of warfare. This provision requires that 'In the study, development, acquisition or adoption of a new weapon, means or method of warfare, a High Contracting Party is under an obligation to determine whether its employment would, in some or all circumstances, be prohibited by this Protocol or by any other rule of international law applicable to the High Contracting Party' (Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions 1977). This statement obligates a nation at least to consider the laws of armed conflict before employing IW means. That consideration should focus on both the means of force and perhaps more importantly on the effects.\nConsequently, the fact that a particular military activity constituting a method of warfare is not specifically regulated does not mean that it can be used without restrictions. Based on that, nothing precludes assuming that the more recent forms of IW, which do not involve the use of traditional weapons, are subject to IHL just as any new weapon or delivery system has been so far when used in an armed conflict. (Dörmann 2004) Another fundamental rule of warfare, found in Article 35 (1) of AP I, states that 'the right of the Parties to the conflict to choose methods or means of warfare is not unlimited' (Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions 1977). So far, hostilities have involved physical violence and kinetic energy leading to human casualties or material damage. In the case of IHL, the motivation for the application of the law is to limit the damage and provide care for the casualties. This would support an expansive interpretation of when IHL begins to apply. If a cyber attack is directed against an enemy in order to cause physical damage or loss of life, it can hardly be disputed that such an attack is in fact a method of warfare and is subject to limitations under IHL. (Dörmann 2004) ## 3.2 The principle of distinction Just as information warfare attacks may be difficult to encompass within the 'use of force' concept, it may be also difficult to define their targets as military (and thus generally legitimate targets) or civilian (generally forbidden). The dual-use nature of many telecommunications networks complicates the questions of the applicability of IHL as a constraint on information warfare, because the intangible damage that cyber attacks cause may not be the sort of injuries against which the humanitarian law of war is designed to protect noncombatants. The definition of the term\"attack\"is of decisive importance for the application of the various rules giving effect to the principle of distinction and for most of the rules providing special protection for certain objects. In accordance with Art. 49 (1) of AP I, 'attacks' means acts of violence against the adversary, whether in offence or in defense (Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions 1977). If the term 'acts of violence' denotes only physical force, the concept of 'attacks' excludes dissemination of propaganda, embargoes or other non-physical means of psychological, political or economic warfare. (Dörmann 2004) Based on that understanding and distinction, cyber attacks through viruses, worms, logic bombs etc. that result in physical damage to persons, or damage to objects that goes beyond the computer program or data attacked can be qualified as 'acts of violence' and thus as an attack in the sense of IHL. From this point of view, it is helpful to look at how the concept of attack is applied to other means and methods of warfare. There is general agreement that, for example, the employment of biological or chemical agents that does not cause a physical explosion, such as the use of asphyxiating or poisonous gases, would constitute an attack (Dörmann 2004).\nIf one admits that employing a IW method constitute an attack, AP I imposes: - The obligation to direct attacks only against\"military objectives\"and not to attack civilians or civilian objects; (Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions 1977, Art. 48, 51 (2), 52) - The prohibition of indiscriminate attacks, including attacks that may be expected to cause excessive incidental civilian casualties or damages; (Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions 1977, Art. 51 (4), (5)) - The requirement to take the necessary precautions to ensure that the previous two rules are respected, (Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions 1977, Art. 57) in particular the requirement to minimize incidental civilian damage and the obligation to abstain from attacks if such damage is likely to be excessive to the value of the military objective to be attacked; (Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions 1977, Art. 51 (5)(b), 57 (2)(a)(ii) and (iii)) These rules operate in exactly the same way whether the attack is carried out using traditional weapons or IW techniques. Problems that arise in applying these rules are therefore not necessarily unique to IW. They are more related to the interpretation of, for example, what constitutes a military objective or which collateral damage would be excessive.\n## 4. Legal perspectives on IW The laws of war always faced two challenges. The first was that war's confrontational nature and tremendously high stakes often frustrated efforts to set reasonable limits on behavior. Fortunately, the international community has generated international conventions and war crimes tribunals to solve this problem.\nThe laws of war also face a second challenge, which is how to adapt these laws to technological change. This dynamic itself is as old as civilization, but it became more acute in the last one hundred years, since technological progress has accelerated. The result is that weapons are developing much faster than international law, and there is every reason to believe that this trend will continue to accelerate in the future.\n\nAs IW strategy and technology evolve, international law scholars will have to fit this new kind of warfare into an analytical framework developed to address a different conception of war.\nFirst, the U.N. Charter and other existing treaty regimes do not create a clear legal prohibition of many types of IW attacks. For international law effectively to address IW attacks there must be established a correspondence between terms like ‘use of force’, ‘armed attack’ or ‘armed aggression’ and IW methods and means of combat. Also, it would be necessary to set limits to IW activities similar to the classic *jus in bello* principles, like just war, discrimination or proportionality.\nThe second, and the more difficult part, is to find a way to solve the practical problems associated with both launching and defending against cyber attacks, including the fundamental issue of attribution and in particular state responsibility for cyber attacks. It is technically challenging to localize the physical place from which such an act originates. But even if the origin of an attack can be localized within a particular state, it would be challenging to determine whether the attacker was acting in an individual capacity, or on behalf of a criminal organization, the government or armed forces.\nJust as the identity of the attacker raises difficult questions for any potential IW treaty, so does the identity of the victim. In an IW context, it becomes necessary to ask whether an attack on a company or an institution is an attack on a whole country. It is not necessarily clear that the state in whose territory the injured party resides is the injured state. In a conventional attack, the country where the attack is located has been attacked because its territorial integrity has been violated, but cyberspace is not a customary arena over which states may exercise such control.\nFrom a humanitarian law perspective, it would be essential to be able to ‘mark’ in some way the information systems used to maintain the viability of critical social infrastructure facilities. In the physical world, some of these facilities (such as hospitals) display a distinctive sign, indicating their protected status. Such identifying signs are absent in cyberspace, nor do criteria exist for designating these systems as critical infrastructure.\n## 5. Conclusions Because of the newness of much of the technology involved, no provision of international law explicitly addresses to information warfare. This absence of prohibitions is significant because, as a crudely general rule, that which international law does not prohibit it permits. But the absence is not dispositive, because even where international law does not address particular weapons or technologies, its general principles may apply to the use of those weapons and technologies.\nAlthough the existing body of international law does not necessarily provide definitive and universally accepted answers to the legal issues that Information Warfare development rises, it does provide a structure by which these issues could be addressed and analyzed. However, in order to apply existent norms to IW, it is necessary to accept the consequence-based interpretations of “armed conflict” and “attack”. In the absence of such understandings, the applicability, and therefore adequacy, of present-day humanitarian law principles would come into question. The consideration of IW in the context of *jus ad bellum* also leads to consequence-based interpretation.\nDevising a system of international law addressing Information Warfare or Information Operations could rectify many of the deficiencies of the current legal system and provide states with additional functional benefits that do not currently exist. First, it can remedy uncertainty. Drafting new rules provides an opportunity to rectify translation problems that plague IW under the law of war. It could give states and their militaries a clear sense of the rules of engagement in the information age.\nA dedicated law would allow states not simply to choose among available interpretations of the prohibition on the use of force, but to craft a standard tailored to IW without the additional inclusion problems that currently exist. Similarly, states could set the bar for when IW triggers the civilian distinction requirement and address whether any or all information networks constitute legitimate military objectives.\nDisclaimer: The views, opinions, and recommendations contained in this analysis are those of the author and should not be construed as an official position, policy, or decision of the Romanian Intelligence Service"

Introduction\n\nIntensive development of information and communication technologies and their wide use in all spheres of human activity have accelerated post-industrial development and the building of a global information society, becoming a driving force for social development. The global information infrastructure provides unprecedented opportunities for communication among people, their socialization and access to information. Individuals, societies and states depend on the stability and reliability of the information infrastructure.\n\nComputers and computer networks have become increasingly integral to government, military, and civilian functions. They allow instant communication and provide platforms on which business and government alike can operate. Computers now control both military and civilian infrastructures, including nuclear arsenals, telecommunication networks, electrical power systems, water supplies, oil storage facilities, financial systems, and emergency services.\n\nAs the worldwide explosion of information technology (IT) is changing the ways that business, government, and education are conducted, it also promises to change the way wars are waged. The development of information technology makes it possible for adversaries to attack each other in new ways and to inflict new forms of damage, and may create new targets for attack. Attackers may use international networks to damage or disrupt enemy systems, without ever physically entering the enemy's country.\n\nInformation technologies enable a fundamentally new and effective means to disrupt or destroy a country's industry, its economy, social infrastructure and public administration. They have the potential to be a means of combat capable of achieving goals related to inter-state confrontation at the tactical, operational and strategic levels. Whatever the development and diffusion of information technology mean for the future of warfare, it is apparent that many of the new forms of attack that information technology enables are qualitatively different from prior forms of attack. The use of such tools as computer intrusion and computer viruses, for example, take war out of the physical, kinetic\n\n200",

Effects previously attainable only through physical destruction are now accomplished remotely with the silent means of information technology.\n\nThese new ways of fighting have been labeled Information Warfare (IW). Definitions and conceptions of IW are numerous, but generally entail preserving one's own information and information technology while exploiting, disrupting, or denying the use of an adversary's (Shackelford 2009). In US military doctrine, IW it is part of a much larger strategic shift that was named Information Operations (IO). Information Operations involve actions taken to affect adversary information and information systems while defending one's own information and information systems. Information Operations apply across all phases of an operation, throughout the range of military operations, and at every level of war. Information Warfare is Information Operations conducted during time of crisis or conflict, including war, to achieve or promote specific objectives over a specific adversary or adversaries (Joint Chiefs of Staff 1998).\n\nThe new emerging vulnerabilities that information age generates are more likely to be exploited by opponents of developed states that cannot hope to prevail on the battlefield, or even at the negotiations table. A lesser-advantaged state hoping to seriously harm a dominant adversary must inevitably compete asymmetrically. It must seek to counter the strengths of the opponent not head-on, but rather employing unorthodox means to strike at centers of gravity.\n\nIW offers such asymmetrical benefits. In the first place, in many cases a computer network attack will either not merit a response involving the use of force, or the legality of such a response could be debatable, even if the victim is able to accurately identify the attack and its source. Thus, because of the potentially grave impact of cyber attacks on a state's infrastructure, it can prove a high gain, low risk option for a state outclassed militarily or economically. Moreover, to the extent that an opponent is militarily and economically advantaged, it is probably technologically dependent, and, therefore, teeming with tempting targets.\n\n## 2. IW and the 'use of force' concept\n\nSeveral rules govern when force can be used (the jus ad bellum, which focuses on the criteria for going to war, covering issues such as right purpose, duly constituted authority, last resort) and how states can use that force in an armed conflict (the jus in bello or 'law of war', that creates the concept of just war-fighting, covering discrimination, proportionality, humanity etc). These rules have diverse sources, including the U.N. Charter, international humanitarian law treaties, including the 1949 Geneva Conventions, as well as customary international humanitarian law. Some of these existing laws involve principles of general applicability that could encompass IW. Nevertheless, the gap between physical weaponry (whether kinetic, biological, or chemical) and IW's virtual methods can be substantial, creating translation problems.\n\nThe sort of intangible damage that IW attacks may cause is analytically different from the physical damage caused by the use of armed force in traditional warfare. The kind of destruction that bombs and bullets cause is easy to see and understand, and fits well within longstanding views of what war means. In contrast, the disruption of information systems, including the corruption or manipulation of stored or transmitted data, may cause intangible damage, such as disruption of civil society or government services. These may be more closely equivalent to activities such as economic sanctions that may be undertaken in times of peace rather than acts of aggression (Greenberg 1998).\n\nWhether or not an information warfare attack can be considered 'use of force' or 'aggression' is relevant to the fact that a forceful response can be justified as self-defense, as well as to the issue of whether a particular response would be proportionate to the original attack.\n\nModern law on the use of force is based on the U.N. Charter. An analysis of international law and IW could begin with the prohibition of the use of force in Article 2(4): 'All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations' (Charter of the United Nations, Art.2(4)). The drafters intended to prohibit all types of force, except those carried out under the aegis of the United Nations or as provided for by the Security Council, and wanted to restrict the use of force severely by sharply limiting its use to situations approved by the Security Council (Barkham 2001).\n\n201",
    "Alexandru Nitu\n\nThe fact is that neither the Charter nor any international body has defined the term ‘use of force’ clearly. That might be the main reason why the use of force prohibition encounters difficulty when translated into the IW context. Not all hostile acts are uses of force. Traditionally, states defined ‘force’ in terms of the instrument used, including ‘armed’ force within the prohibition, but excluding economic and political forms of coercion. This distinction reflects an effort to proscribe those acts most likely to interfere with the U.N.’s primary purpose: maintaining international peace and security.\n\nThe classic ‘instrumentality’ approach argues that IW does not qualify as armed force because it lacks the physical characteristics associated with military coercion (Hollis 2007). The analysis looks at whether there is kinetic impact: some type of explosion or physical force. The Charter was created in the days of weapons that provided blast, heat, and fragmentation damage, so it is clear that these types of kinetic weapons were exclusively present in the minds of the drafters.\n\nStill, some types of cyber attacks can be determined to be uses of force. Since the determination of a use of force requires that a weapon be used, there first must be a method of analogizing IW attacks to weapons. A very good method could be the one proposed by Ian Brownlie, which shifts the traditional use of force analysis from a purely kinetic analysis, based on physical force being applied to the target, to a result-based analysis, evaluating IW attacks is not limited to focusing on the method of the attack (Brownlie 1963). A result-based analysis requires looking at whether there is a kinetic result, that cause damage or injury, rather than whether the weapon itself is kinetic.\n\nThe text of the U.N. Charter offers additional support for the ‘instrumentality’ view in Article 41, which states that ‘measures not involving the use of armed force’ include ‘complete or partial interruption of (...) telegraphic, radio, and other means of communication’ (Charter of the United Nations, Art.41). Clearly, ‘other means of communications’ fairly encompasses computer communications and communication over computer networks. It seems that Article 41 permits countries to deprive another nation of its communications, as well as interrupting communications by manipulation of the target country's data such that it is corrupt and untrustworthy, altering the data to render it useless for that nation's purpose, and actually altering the data such that it achieves an intended purpose for the aggressor nation (DiCenso 2000). Although such measures sound like fair game for IW, the provisions of Article 41 still require the Security Council to decide what measures are to be employed under that article, including force and actions that do not include armed force.\n\nIn order to retain its effectiveness, the Charter’s interpretations must evolve to some degree. The extent to which this happens is important in applying use of force analysis under Article 2(4) as new types of warfare develop. If the definition of the ‘use of force’ is static, then the ban on the use of force gradually will become less effective as new interstate actions occur beyond the boundaries of what the drafters considered (Barkham 2001).\n\nDifficulty in characterizing certain forms of information warfare as ‘force’ or ‘aggression’ under international law does not mean that international legal institutions cannot respond to such attacks. For example, Chapter VII of the U.N. Charter gives the UN Security Council the authority and responsibility to determine the existence of any ‘threat to the peace’ or acts of aggression (Charter of the United Nations, Article 39) and the Council can recommend and lead responses to that (Charter of the United Nations, Article 40). Many information attacks that may not constitute ‘force’ or ‘aggression’ could certainly be considered threats to the peace and thus subject to Security Council action, perhaps including the use of military force. After all, anything that would anger a government to the point that it might feel the need to resort to military action could thus threaten the peace, even if the provocative action was not technically illegal (Greenberg 1998).\n\nOf particular interest for IW analysis is Article 51 of the U.N. Charter, the only exception to the rule stated in Article 2(4). According to Article 51, states can use force pursuant to the inherent right of self-defense in response to an armed attack: ‘Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defense if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security’ (Charter of the United Nations, Art.51). As sole authorization of unilateral use of force outside the U.N. Charter security system, this provision responds to the reality that the international community may not be able to react quickly enough to armed aggression to forestall attack on a victim state. It therefore permits states and their allies to defend themselves until the international help arrives pursuant to Chapter VII.\n\n202",
    "Alexandru Nitu\n\nArticle 51 restricts a state's right of self-defense to situations involving 'armed attack', a narrower category of act than Article 2(4)'s 'use of force'. Although coercion not involving armed force may violate Article 2(4) and result in action under Article 39, it does not follow that states may also react unilaterally pursuant to Article 51. This narrowing plainly reflects the Charter's preference for community responses over individual ones, even to threats to peace (Schmitt 1999). In the case of a IW attack, it is also a prudent approach due to the difficulty states may have in identifying the correct source of an attack.\n\nThe main problem IW poses for Article 2(4) does not derive from its large-scale applications, but from attacks that do not destroy life or property, such as subversion of property, electronic blockades, and incursions. The large-scale attacks are similar to conventional methods of warfare and fit comfortably within traditional use of force analysis. The lower-level attacks present the problem when analyzed under Article 2(4) because they threaten to erase the distinction between acts of force and acts of coercion. The severity of an IW attack might not be identified promptly, so it would not be feasible to require a victim to conduct a damage assessment to determine whether an IW penetration were a use of force or merely of coercion. (Barkham 2001)\n\n## 3. International legal limits on IW\n\n### 3.1 Limits on the use of weapons\n\nMany of the international legal provisions regarding armed conflicts are found in the 1949 Geneva Conventions and the 1977 Additional Protocols to the Geneva Conventions. The Geneva Conventions, with their focus on the protection of persons in enemy hands, are of some relevance to IW. Without reference to specific weapons, the Additional Protocols (AP) address various methods and means of warfare in general terms, thus being able to present a framework for the use of IW.\n\nIn order for International Humanitarian Law (IHL) to apply to a particular armed conflict, neither formal declaration of war, nor recognition of a state of war is required. Instead, the requirements of the law become applicable as from the actual opening of hostilities. An international armed conflict is perceived as any difference arising between two States and leading to the intervention of armed forces, even if one of the Parties denies the existence of a state of war (Pictet 1952).\n\nThere is no doubt that an armed conflict exists and IHL applies once traditional kinetic weapons are used in combination with new methods of IW. The most difficult situation, as far as applicability of IHL is concerned, would be the one where the first, or the only hostile acts are conducted by means of IW. The question is if this type of conflict depends on the type of attack in order to be qualified as constituting an armed conflict within the meaning of the 1949 Geneva Convention and the Additional Protocols.\n\nSame as in the U.N. Charter's case, the fact that IW developed only after the adoption of the Protocols does not exclude their applicability. The first Additional Protocol to the Geneva Conventions made specific reference for consideration of new weapons. Article 36 of Additional Protocol I (AP I) is a strong indicator that the drafters of AP I anticipated the application of its rules to new developments of methods and means of warfare. This provision requires that 'In the study, development, acquisition or adoption of a new weapon, means or method of warfare, a High Contracting Party is under an obligation to determine whether its employment would, in some or all circumstances, be prohibited by this Protocol or by any other rule of international law applicable to the High Contracting Party' (Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions 1977). This statement obligates a nation at least to consider the laws of armed conflict before employing IW means. That consideration should focus on both the means of force and perhaps more importantly on the effects.\n\nConsequently, the fact that a particular military activity constituting a method of warfare is not specifically regulated does not mean that it can be used without restrictions. Based on that, nothing precludes assuming that the more recent forms of IW, which do not involve the use of traditional weapons, are subject to IHL just as any new weapon or delivery system has been so far when used in an armed conflict. (Dörmann 2004)\n\nAnother fundamental rule of warfare, found in Article 35 (1) of AP I, states that 'the right of the Parties to the conflict to choose methods or means of warfare is not unlimited' (Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions 1977). So far, hostilities have involved physical violence and kinetic energy\n\n203",
    "Alexandru Nitu\n\nleading to human casualties or material damage. In the case of IHL, the motivation for the application of the law is to limit the damage and provide care for the casualties. This would support an expansive interpretation of when IHL begins to apply. If a cyber attack is directed against an enemy in order to cause physical damage or loss of life, it can hardly be disputed that such an attack is in fact a method of warfare and is subject to limitations under IHL. (Dörmann 2004)\n\n## 3.2 The principle of distinction\n\nJust as information warfare attacks may be difficult to encompass within the 'use of force' concept, it may be also difficult to define their targets as military (and thus generally legitimate targets) or civilian (generally forbidden). The dual-use nature of many telecommunications networks complicates the questions of the applicability of IHL as a constraint on information warfare, because the intangible damage that cyber attacks cause may not be the sort of injuries against which the humanitarian law of war is designed to protect noncombatants. (Greenberg 1998)\n\nThe definition of the term \"attack\" is of decisive importance for the application of the various rules giving effect to the principle of distinction and for most of the rules providing special protection for certain objects. In accordance with Art. 49 (1) of AP I, 'attacks' means acts of violence against the adversary, whether in offence or in defense (Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions 1977). If the term 'acts of violence' denotes only physical force, the concept of 'attacks' excludes dissemination of propaganda, embargoes or other non-physical means of psychological, political or economic warfare. (Dörmann 2004)\n\nBased on that understanding and distinction, cyber attacks through viruses, worms, logic bombs etc. that result in physical damage to persons, or damage to objects that goes beyond the computer program or data attacked can be qualified as 'acts of violence' and thus as an attack in the sense of IHL. From this point of view, it is helpful to look at how the concept of attack is applied to other means and methods of warfare. There is general agreement that, for example, the employment of biological or chemical agents that does not cause a physical explosion, such as the use of asphyxiating or poisonous gases, would constitute an attack (Dörmann 2004).\n\nIf one admits that employing a IW method constitute an attack, AP I imposes:\n\n- The obligation to direct attacks only against \"military objectives\" and not to attack civilians or civilian objects; (Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions 1977, Art. 48, 51 (2), 52)\n- The prohibition of indiscriminate attacks, including attacks that may be expected to cause excessive incidental civilian casualties or damages; (Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions 1977, Art. 51 (4), (5))\n- The requirement to take the necessary precautions to ensure that the previous two rules are respected, (Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions 1977, Art. 57) in particular the requirement to minimize incidental civilian damage and the obligation to abstain from attacks if such damage is likely to be excessive to the value of the military objective to be attacked; (Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions 1977, Art. 51 (5)(b), 57 (2)(a)(ii) and (iii))\n\nThese rules operate in exactly the same way whether the attack is carried out using traditional weapons or IW techniques. Problems that arise in applying these rules are therefore not necessarily unique to IW. They are more related to the interpretation of, for example, what constitutes a military objective or which collateral damage would be excessive.\n\n## 4. Legal perspectives on IW\n\nThe laws of war always faced two challenges. The first was that war's confrontational nature and tremendously high stakes often frustrated efforts to set reasonable limits on behavior. Fortunately, the international community has generated international conventions and war crimes tribunals to solve this problem.\n\nThe laws of war also face a second challenge, which is how to adapt these laws to technological change. This dynamic itself is as old as civilization, but it became more acute in the last one hundred years, since technological progress has accelerated. The result is that weapons are developing much faster than international law, and there is every reason to believe that this trend will continue to accelerate in the future.\n\n204",
    "Alexandru Nitu\n\nAs IW strategy and technology evolve, international law scholars will have to fit this new kind of warfare into an analytical framework developed to address a different conception of war.\n\nFirst, the U.N. Charter and other existing treaty regimes do not create a clear legal prohibition of many types of IW attacks. For international law effectively to address IW attacks there must be established a correspondence between terms like ‘use of force’, ‘armed attack’ or ‘armed aggression’ and IW methods and means of combat. Also, it would be necessary to set limits to IW activities similar to the classic *jus in bello* principles, like just war, discrimination or proportionality.\n\nThe second, and the more difficult part, is to find a way to solve the practical problems associated with both launching and defending against cyber attacks, including the fundamental issue of attribution and in particular state responsibility for cyber attacks. It is technically challenging to localize the physical place from which such an act originates. But even if the origin of an attack can be localized within a particular state, it would be challenging to determine whether the attacker was acting in an individual capacity, or on behalf of a criminal organization, the government or armed forces.\n\nJust as the identity of the attacker raises difficult questions for any potential IW treaty, so does the identity of the victim. In an IW context, it becomes necessary to ask whether an attack on a company or an institution is an attack on a whole country. It is not necessarily clear that the state in whose territory the injured party resides is the injured state. In a conventional attack, the country where the attack is located has been attacked because its territorial integrity has been violated, but cyberspace is not a customary arena over which states may exercise such control.\n\nFrom a humanitarian law perspective, it would be essential to be able to ‘mark’ in some way the information systems used to maintain the viability of critical social infrastructure facilities. In the physical world, some of these facilities (such as hospitals) display a distinctive sign, indicating their protected status. Such identifying signs are absent in cyberspace, nor do criteria exist for designating these systems as critical infrastructure.\n\n## 5. Conclusions\n\nBecause of the newness of much of the technology involved, no provision of international law explicitly addresses to information warfare. This absence of prohibitions is significant because, as a crudely general rule, that which international law does not prohibit it permits. But the absence is not dispositive, because even where international law does not address particular weapons or technologies, its general principles may apply to the use of those weapons and technologies (Greenberg 1998).\n\nAlthough the existing body of international law does not necessarily provide definitive and universally accepted answers to the legal issues that Information Warfare development rises, it does provide a structure by which these issues could be addressed and analyzed. However, in order to apply existent norms to IW, it is necessary to accept the consequence-based interpretations of “armed conflict” and “attack”. In the absence of such understandings, the applicability, and therefore adequacy, of present-day humanitarian law principles would come into question. The consideration of IW in the context of *jus ad bellum* also leads to consequence-based interpretation.\n\nDevising a system of international law addressing Information Warfare or Information Operations could rectify many of the deficiencies of the current legal system and provide states with additional functional benefits that do not currently exist. First, it can remedy uncertainty. Drafting new rules provides an opportunity to rectify translation problems that plague IW under the law of war. It could give states and their militaries a clear sense of the rules of engagement in the information age.\n\nA dedicated law would allow states not simply to choose among available interpretations of the prohibition on the use of force, but to craft a standard tailored to IW without the additional inclusion problems that currently exist. Similarly, states could set the bar for when IW triggers the civilian distinction requirement and address whether any or all information networks constitute legitimate military objectives.\n\nDisclaimer: The views, opinions, and recommendations contained in this analysis are those of the author and should not be construed as an official position, policy, or decision of the Romanian Intelligence Service\n\n205",

    "abstract": "In present times, societies and economies increasingly rely on electronic communications, becoming more vulnerable to threats from cyberspace. At the same time, states' military and intelligence organizations are increasingly developing the capability to attack and defend computer systems. The progress of information technology makes it possible for adversaries to attack each other in new ways, inflicting new forms of damage; technological change enables cyberwarfare acts that do not fit within existing legal categories, or may reveal contradictions among existing legal principles. The paper examines the relationship between information warfare and the law, especially international law and the law of war, as it is apparent that some fundamental questions regarding this new and emerging type of security threat need to be explored. For example, what types of activities between nation states, could or should be called information warfare? What are 'force', 'armed attack', or 'armed aggression' - terms from the UN Charter - in the Information Age, and do they equate to information warfare? Information warfare is neither 'armed' in the traditional sense, nor does it necessarily involve conflict, so an important issue is if 'war' between states necessarily require physical violence, kinetic energy, and human casualties. A threshold question that arises from the development of information warfare techniques is thus the definitional one: has the development of information warfare technology and techniques taken information warfare out of the existing legal definition of war? Characteristics of information technology and warfare pose problems to those who would use international law to limit information warfare, and leave legal space for those who would wage such warfare. Consequently, there may be confusion over what limits may apply to the conduct of information warfare, and when information warfare attacks may be carried out. Prospects of new technological attacks pose problems for international law because law is inherently conservative. From this point of view, the paper examines how the law itself might change in response to the fast development of information technology and how will long-established legal principles such as national sovereignty and the inviolability of national borders be affected by the ability of cyberspace to transcend such concepts.",
