Intelligence is increasingly facilitating information superiority through an understanding of the cyber domain. The Department of Defense's \"Joint Vision 2020\" establishes the goal of information superiority on the battlefield. This information superiority enables decision superiority and favorably tilts the strategic and tactical balance. Information superiority is built on cyber power, scale and complexity of attacks, robustness of defense, policy positions, systemic vulnerabilities and dependencies, and actor anonymity and attribution issues. Intelligence plays a mission critical role in assessing these characteristics. The discussion below examines the role of intelligence in identifying these characteristics within the cyber domain and examines how it influences the decision-making of policy-makers. Specifically the focus hones in on how intelligence increases the effectiveness of identifying potential attackers within the cyber domain and informs the decision-making of policy-makers when engaging in covert cyber action directed against a potential adversary. The discussion is designed to serve as a strategic framework in which to understand the role of intelligence within the cyber domain.\nIs it really necessary to examine the role of intelligence within the cyber domain as contextually different than in a conventional domain? The short answer is yes. Cyber necessitates independent examination because it is characteristically different, and yet at the same time it is a pervasive feature affecting outcomes within other domains. What differentiates cyber from land, sea, air, and space are three fundamental attributes relevant to intelligence practitioners. First, the cyber domain is a man-made domain. Second, military capabilities across the other domains are managed through the cyber domain. Third, military and civilian aspects of the cyber domain are often intertwined and difficult to differentiate. These attributes pose unique opportunities and problems for intelligence officials.\nThe man-made nature of the cyber domain makes it a largely virtual domain with its value corresponding to the speed and volume of information contained\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER SEVEN\nwithin it. However, the cyber domain is not entirely virtual and has numerous real-world connection points to everything from industrial control systems of power and water management facilities to the weapon systems of drones flying above distant battlefields.\nCyberspace is not tangible in the same way as more conventional domains and therefore necessitates a new form of dynamic intelligence evolving from all-source collection of conventional and novel intelligence sources. A recent National Research Council report states that intelligence in the cyber domain is useful for both strategic and tactical purposes.¹ The strategic and tactical importance of intelligence's role in influencing the cyber domain falls within the concept of all-source intelligence. Loch Johnson defines all-source intelligence as one of the fundamental propositions of a theory of strategic intelligence.² More importantly for the purposes of understanding the operational and political environments within which offensive and defensive actions in cyberspace can occur, it is necessary to understand what intelligence is within decisions regarding the cyber domain and how intelligence influences those decisions.\n## DEFINING INTELLIGENCE\nThere are dozens of different definitions of intelligence, each of which is in some way applicable to understanding cyber action. One of the more succinct and conceptually ordered comes from Michael Warner, who defines intelligence as a \"secret, state activity to understand or influence foreign entities.\"³ His definition establishes the fundamental premises of both collection and analysis, while including actions designed to influence. Intelligence is vital to the cyber domain because foreign entities are increasingly storing, managing, and directing their governmental, public, private, and military functions in a digitized world.\nThe traditional intelligence collection types (INTs) are still of immense value, yet they must be combined with aspects of the digitized target spectrum to provide a holistic view of both threats and opportunities. At present the majority of studies in the public domain have focused on defense.⁴ This defensive posture is made clear by General Keith Alexander, the director of the National Security Agency and commander of United States Cyber Command, when he writes: \"US Cyber Command's efforts and planning aim to ensure that the DoD has done all it can to defend and deter determined adversaries, mitigate dangerous threats, and address nagging vulnerabilities, so that even our most capable opponents will know that interfering with our nation's equities in cyberspace is a losing proposition.\"⁵\nThis defensive and deterrent-reliant posture is limiting and prone to inadequacies. Echoing Machiavelli and to some extent Sun Tzu, the adage \"the best defense is a good offense\" offers a novel way of considering action and intelli\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nThe Role of Intelligence in Cyberspace [103]\ngence within cyber. More accurately, it allows for a systematic approach to both national cyber defensive and offensive resource allocations. Beyond the efficiency argument for shifting the focus from solely defense to a balance between defense and offense, intelligence collection can help to inform offensive strategies and the decision to use cyber as a weapon. The role of intelligence within cyber becomes increasingly important when considering the difficulty of achieving any significant measure of deterrence within the cyber domain.⁶\nThe defensive orientation of the majority of cyber literature has a constraining effect on decision-making processes for the use of offensive cyber weapons. This defensive focus is largely due to both the alarmist calls of some scholars and policy-makers and an information communications technologies industry orientation offering many more strategies for defense than for offense. While I do not dispute the need for defense, this defensive focus leads the national security establishment down a path of attempting to create an impenetrable system. If there is one thing that is abundantly clear in the cyber domain it is that the only impenetrable system is the one that has not been made. Cyber is based on physics and algorithms. The mathematics and science behind security measures can be immensely complex and take massive computing power to penetrate, but that does not make them impenetrable. Even the most robust systems secured with checks and encryptions are still highly vulnerable to their users' ignorance or malice, as was the case with Edward Snowden in 2013.\nInstead of focusing on a solely carte blanche defensive posture toward cyber security, intelligence can provide both an offensive and defensive picture more effective at safeguarding national security. Taking a step back from the conventional cyber security literature, intelligence can direct cyber security efforts to not merely safeguard national security but also provide an offensive tool for use against other states. The vast literature on intelligence, ranging from the way intelligence influences the policy-making process to how it helps to understand aspects of the development of utility for actions, serves as a guide in defining the role of intelligence within the cyber domain.\nReflecting on Warner's definition of intelligence, the spectrum of intelligence collection methods—from human intelligence (HUMINT) to the more technical collection methods of signals intelligence (SIGINT), measurement and signatures intelligence (MASINT), geospatial intelligence (GEOINT), and open source intelligence (OSINT)—works together in an all-source environment to provide an accurate understanding of foreign entities. (Table 7.1 provides a quick definitional reference for the various intelligence collection types.) The understanding provided by intelligence has largely focused on the conventional domains and on political decision-making. However, as decisions in conventional domains increasingly migrate toward cyberspace, and the systems controlling the tools used in these domains increasingly become digitally connected, the\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER SEVEN\nTABLE 7.1 Intelligence Collection Methods\n|  Intelligence Source Type | Definition  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  Open Source (OSINT) | Overtly available information found, selected, and acquired from publicly available source.  |\n|  Measurement and Signatures (MASINT) | Intelligence detected and classified from targets that identify or describe signatures (distinctive characteristics) of fixed or dynamic target sources.  |\n|  Human (HUMINT) | Intelligence collected through interpersonal contact via human collection officers.  |\n|  Geospatial (GEOINT)* | The exploitation and analysis of imagery and geospatial information to describe, assess, and visually depict physical features and geographically referenced activities on the earth.

Williams, Shimeal, and Dunlevy, \"Intelligence Analysis for Internet Security.\" CYBERINT is considered independent of traditional SIGINT. However, as in many of the other types of intelligence collection, techniques and agencies often overlap.\nimportance of understanding the technical schematics and decision processes becomes vital to national security.\nNick Cullather, in an article on digital connections on the battlefield, indicates significant advances in the development of network-centric warfare. Cullather notes that the rise of a \"revolution in military affairs\" has largely not been matched by the intelligence community's ability to keep up.[7] This is of particular importance when looking beyond the network-centric battlefield of conventional weapons to the new zone of confrontation within cyberspace itself. Similarly, Michael Herman finds that counterterrorism intelligence analysis requires a broad spectrum of information sources brought together.[8] ICT facilitates the mitigation of \"stovepipes\" and increases the efficiency in information transference.[9] Information transmission has also been facilitated following the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 by the creation of \"fusion centers.\"[10] ICT has a role to play not only in the conduct of war on the battlefield, but also in the management of a conventional traditional threat spectrum within the fusion centers and beyond in the wider intelligence community.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nThe Role of Intelligence in Cyberspace [105]\nTerrorism is not commonly regarded as part of the conventional threat spectrum, yet in reality most terrorist acts take place in the physical world and require bombs and guns. However, the information coordination necessary to organize, plan, and conduct warfare, terrorist acts, and political strategies has largely shifted to cyberspace. The 2008 Mumbai terrorist attacks are a poignant example of terrorists leveraging technology and open source intelligence collected from public sites and software such as Google Earth to plan and orchestrate mass murder.[11] As horrific as the use of digital tools for planning attacks is, it is not isolated to open source intelligence collection via tools. Terrorists also use open source cryptography and crypto-currencies to finance their operations.[12] Intelligence agencies are in a competition with other states and organizations to leverage tools effectively to prevent attacks by terrorists and to mitigate international incidents before they arise.\nWhile open source research is fundamentally more powerful than ever before, available open source information provides only a limited aperture to realistically size up threats and targets within cyberspace itself. The problem of intelligence in cyberspace is massive both in terms of scale and complexity of data. Joel Brenner, a former inspector general of the National Security Agency and head of U.S. counterintelligence, indicated there has been an enormous threat emanating from within cyberspace that is not being adequately addressed.[13]\nModern warfare, command and control warfare (C2W), is network centric. Large swaths of the national critical infrastructures in states that pose conventional security and economic threats to the United States are controlled by digital systems. The literature is less focused on the need for understanding these vulnerabilities than it is on safeguarding them. The defensive focus, to a large degree, overshadows the development of offensive capabilities.\nPhil Williams, Timothy Shimeal, and Casey Dunlevy make a well-reasoned case arguing for focused intelligence efforts on identifying threats to national cyber security.[14] These authors make a valid point that needs to be addressed and is being addressed by several national strategy documents on the topic, including the National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace and the \"International Strategy for Cyberspace.\" One report of particular importance addressing many of the issues brought up by Williams, Shimeal, and Dunlevy is the October 2011 report by the Office of the National Counterintelligence Executive on cyber espionage.[15] A broad spectrum of federal strategies and reports has made identification and protection against vulnerabilities a top priority. More recently the president of the United States under Executive Order 13636 in February 2013 directed the government to begin actively seeking out and planning strategies to mitigate cyber threats to national critical infrastructure.\nThis is a process that is under way and includes an alphabet soup of agencies from across the civilian and military spectrum of the government. A re\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER SEVEN\ncurrent problem that keeps cropping up in many of the discussions on critical infrastructure is network awareness. Many companies and firms affiliated with critical infrastructure do not have an adequate understanding of their own vulnerabilities, let alone how they interact to create systemic threats. One industry based on personal communications and working experience that seems to be working very hard to address these issues is the U.S. financial sector, which in many ways is pioneering cyber security efforts under E.O. 13636.\nCurrently most cyber security is based on attacks or incidents in progress or that have already occurred. It is difficult, if not impossible, to defend against an unknown attack. Much of the effort in the United States cyber community now seems to be equivalent to plugging the holes in the dike after it floods. It is a fact that most cyber attacks are repeat attacks originating at the lower end of the threat spectrum, making the strategy of filling holes in the dike an absolute necessity in an effort to prevent repeat intrusions from identical or similar malware types. Yet this post hoc strategy largely fails to address the more serious problem of accurately anticipating what the next type of attack is going to be. This strategy, best referred to as a \"Maginot Line\" strategy, is prone to failure in areas where technological and strategic capabilities rapidly evolve. The real challenge is to develop intelligence-based approaches to cyberspace that prevent future attacks before they happen.\nThere is a significant and sustained effort underway on the defensive side of the cyber debate within the DoD to develop better security. The DoD is currently employing at least three categories of defensive teams to facilitate DoD network protection: DoD information network operations teams (DoDIN Ops), defensive cyber operations—internal defensive measures teams (DCO-IDM or cyber protection teams), and defensive cyber operations—response action teams (DCO-RA or national mission teams).[16] Yet all of these teams are heavily reliant on intelligence on the cyber environment for defense (ICE-D). The teams that fit into these categories are tasked with segments of the overall problem. While the DoDIN-Ops teams are tasked with ensuring sustained secure operations on DoD networks, they are not focused on adversary behaviors in those networks. Their work is informed by adversary behaviors but seeks to maintain network security in aggregate. DCO-IDM or cyber protection teams function as hunter killers within the network. They are tasked with seeking out individuals engaging DoD networks illegally and stopping the attacks or exploits. DCO-RA or national mission teams are tasked with responding to adversary behavior in DoD networks. As should be readily apparent, the problem is enormous and relies on intelligence for all aspects of ICE-D functions. The DoD network environment alone is composed of millions of computing devices and users.\nBecause we exist in a world of known unknowns and unknown unknowns, to paraphrase Secretary Rumsfeld, cyber security is likely the former rather than\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nThe Role of Intelligence in Cyberspace [107]\nthe latter.¹⁷ How can intelligence be used to improve the cyber security situation not only to protect the national infrastructure in a more systematic and logical manner but also to use this information to inform the decision-making processes of policy-makers?\nOne problem associated with the U.S. cyber community is proximity. Because the community develops, tests, and employs its own tools, it is unable to take into account methods of testing that have not yet threatened systems in the past. This is an in-the-box, out-of-the-box, forget-the-box problem. The designers of systems, software, and networks are talented and smart individuals; they lead the world in technical innovation, yet because they are inside their own systems, it becomes it intrinsically difficult to isolate unforeseen problems. United States Cyber Command and various other teams from the services and the various academies have tried to address this problem by creating competitive cyber teams that compete with one other and against civilian competitors in various challenges such as DefCon capture the flag contests and others. These various DCO and DoDIN-Ops teams also engage one another to consistently foster novel thinking on security.\nYet the challenge is immense, and solutions are best achieved by constant introspection. Below are several proposed strategies to help facilitate the development of improved defensive operations. First, the current orientation toward plugging holes must continue. While this post hoc process is frustrating, it prevents or at least slows further intrusions. The mentality of these DoDIN-Ops is one of defense. The objective is to secure and defend systems against all possible or known types of attacks. The most realistic approach is to defend against known types of attacks. The systems become fortified against repeat incidents or at least can minimize their severity. The work of these teams is not sexy; it is not offense oriented; it is a process of continuous network security development. Second, DCO-IDM teams must also actively hunt in government and defense networks for potential adversaries and leverage information gained through all source intelligence collection and communication with DoDIN-Ops, DCO-RA, and OCO teams to anticipate potential blind spots. These teams must also be regularly rotated to provide them time to think like attackers. Third, DCO-RA teams must leverage all-source intelligence and continuous communications with DCO-IDM and OCO teams to engage adversaries in a defensive posture on foreign networks before they endanger DoD networks. While these teams are in the process of getting organized and established, it is important that these teams have clear interteam communications to mitigate stovepiping. The co-location or consistent rotation of team members would likely facilitate enhanced operational results. The co-location and coordination of members within a team should be of paramount importance as it allows analysts and technicians the opportunity to collaborate and developed a detailed and synergistic understanding of capabilities.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER SEVEN\nThe wider intelligence community must use all-source methods to collect as much intelligence on potential opponents as possible. This means profiling every aspect of other nations' cyber offensive and defensive capabilities. This requires a robust all-source collection methodology. Signals intelligence must look for transmissions and communications as well as spikes in Internet traffic and geo-locate them using IP addresses. These geo-located IP addresses need to be analyzed using satellites and drones to provide accurate geospatial information on the areas in question. Open source intelligence collection should attempt to gain as much publicly available information as possible on areas of interest through legal means. Once all of this information has been compiled and assessed, targeted HUMINT operations should begin working on developing assets within these areas or with connections to these areas. These agents should be recruited for multiple purposes. First, they should be used to secure intelligence on the capabilities of potential adversaries. These capabilities are defined in more detail below. Second, agents should also be recruited to become potential insider threats, a tool of particular importance on air-gapped systems.[18] Third, intelligence agencies should also place an emphasis on cyber exploitation (CE) and attempt to probe and map out network infrastructures, vulnerabilities, and strengths of adversaries. The last point is of importance both from an offensive and defensive strategic orientation.\nAnother major problem with the cyber domain arises out of its systemic complexity. As Williams, Shimeal, and Dunlevy accurately note, cyber defenders often do not have a realistic or accurate picture of their own systems, let alone the systems of adversaries who are attacking them.[19] Following their recommendations, the national security community would be prudent to make use of the principle of knowing yourself. This requires a consistent focus on domestic systems. However, only focusing on domestic systems leads to the \"Maginot Line\" tendency in which it is assumed networks are created to be impenetrable.\n# INTELLIGENCE AND THE CYBER BATTLESPACE\nThe cyber domain is a modern battlespace and necessitates a holistic understanding. To defend against or engage in offensive actions, it is necessary to have an accurate understanding of the operational environment. According to Edward Waltz, any battlespace, whether offensive or defensive, requires a combination of dominant battlespace awareness (DBA) and dominant battlespace knowledge (DBK).[20] The process of identifying what is and is not important to understanding a particular battlespace largely falls to the discretion of policy-makers within the intelligence cycle.\nIn writing about intelligence and decision-making, Stephen Marrin states: \"the intelligence cycle starts with decision-maker information requirements lev\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nThe Role of Intelligence in Cyberspace [109]\nied on intelligence collection capabilities, the processing of collected raw intelligence and transmission of this processed material to analysts who decipher its meaning, and relay that understanding back to the decision-makers.”²¹\nThe decision-maker engages in tasking through a number of different “pull” mechanisms including governmental reports, hearings before Congress, presidential directives, and executive orders. These tasking methods and others combine to facilitate within the intelligence community an accurate understanding of what constitutes the battlespace in the eyes of the policy-maker. Often the planning and direction can be informal requests from the executive or from Congress, and at other times it can come from official strategy documents.\nPrior to 9/11, terrorism was a priority, but the planning and direction of resources had not yet reached a critical mass sufficient to prevent the terrible attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Marrin and others find the intelligence process frequently fails to adequately define what constitutes a tasking priority for the intelligence community, necessitating a “push” from within the community outward. There are many instances in which policy-makers ignore, misinterpret, or misuse intelligence despite adequate tasking and intelligence production and dissemination.²²\nThe push mechanism of the intelligence community can happen in several ways. Often it can follow what constructivists call “norm entrepreneurs.” Entrepreneurs in the cyber domain include Richard Clarke, or John Arquilla and David Ronfeldt, among others.²³ These individuals bring to national policymakers’ attention issues of importance and help direct the intelligence community’s efforts. If, however, they make outlandish claims and statements, their push for new norms can have a backlash and inspire counter-entrepreneurs such as Thomas Rid, who writes that cyber war does not and will not occur.²⁴ Most traditional intelligence push comes from within the intelligence community itself.²⁵ Because the intelligence community is pushing intelligence not requested by the decision-makers, the concept of the intelligence cycle can, as Marrin notes, become linear.²⁶\nBecause the domain is so complex, it is beneficial for the president and policy-makers to have individuals with the requisite understanding of the domain not only in policy and legal terms but also in technical terms. The position currently established is known as the cyber czar. While this position is typically filled by someone with policy or legal expertise, it is beneficial for that individual to have a wide background and a reasonable technical understanding so he or she can facilitate complex discussions. Former cyber czar Melissa Hathaway would be a prime example of the type of individual who could accurately convey the complexity of the technical and historical attributes of interactions in the domain while at the same time have a firm grasp on the policy and legal implications of future actions. This person then sits at the choke point of the\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER SEVEN\npush and pull on the cyber domain and distills the information into a balanced reality applicable for decision-makers.\nFor intelligence to adequately focus its sights on any battlespace, planning and direction from policy-makers must occur. Once policy-makers have established the importance of a battlespace, the intelligence community must find ways to deliver accurate and reliable intelligence. The objective of intelligence collection is not solely to provide real-time information on the battlespace; rather, it is best thought of as battlespace preparation or what Waltz refers to as \"intelligence preparation of the battlespace\" (IPB).[27] Although Waltz specifically refers to IPB in the context of coordinated conventional warfare and the use of information operations in network-centric warfare, the theoretical principles apply across all domains. IPB, according to Waltz, includes providing an understanding of the \"physical, political, electronic, cyber, and other dimensions of the battlespace.\"[28] Alan D. Campen and Douglas H. Dearth reiterate the concept of IPB in Cyberwar 3.0. They state that information warfare requires an accurate knowledge of the battlespace as well as real-time awareness of situations within the battlespace as they arise.\nBefore moving directly into how each collection type can add to a holistic picture of the battlespace, it is necessary to define what constitutes the battlespace in the cyber domain. The battlespace, according to Waltz, constitutes \"all decision-relevant elements within a defined battlespace, and the ability to predict with very high confidence near-term enemy actions and outcomes.\"[29] More specifically this requires an understanding of human, material, and technical capabilities and the relationship of these capabilities within themselves and to other aspects of the operational environment. It is also important to understand the political implications of alterations in capabilities and the environment over time. A battlespace for cyber can be domestic or foreign and is considered to constitute three basic layers: physical, logical, and social layers. Intelligence must inform policy-makers on all three categories.\nThe physical layer is composed of a geographical location and the physical devices that constitute the environment. These devices can include hardware such as computers, switches, and routers. The devices that compose the physical layer can also include computing devices such as mobile phones, cars, airplanes, and ships. The physical layer also includes those devices used to facilitate cyber actions such as transoceanic cables, power stations, and buildings. Knowing the physical attributes of a target is often important when attempting to create cyber-kinetic responses. The physical structure of a network can provide clues as to the purpose of the network or point to vulnerabilities of constituent components of a network.\nBuilt upon the physical layer is a logical layer, which makes many of the aspects of the physical layer function. Firmware and software combine to form\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nThe Role of Intelligence in Cyberspace [111]\na logical layer. Just as there are numerous components to the physical layer there are hundreds if not thousands of different software and firmware applications that combine to make cyberspace function. When targeting a system it is often necessary to have intelligence on the attributes of the system being attacked. A piece of malware designed for a Windows 7 OS zero-day vulnerability will not work if that malware is deployed to a computer running Mac OS X Yosemite.\nLastly, the combination of the physical and the logical layers make the social layer possible. Even if the network and the software layers are air-gapped and highly secure, the social layer, the layer where people interact with the computing device, can still offer up vulnerabilities, as was illustrated in the Stuxnet incident. Knowing who is using a device and how they perceive and interact with the world around them can open up a variety of vulnerabilities including social engineering and phishing. The social layer is composed of both the actual people and personalities using the computing devices and the cyber persona of the individual using a platform.\nAggregating outward, the layers of cyberspace and their attributes in the vernacular of international relations constitute capabilities. Capabilities can be broadly defined as including mechanisms of offensive and defensive military strength such as size and number of offensive cyber units. Capabilities can include doctrinal measures or indicators such as official cyber security and warfare doctrines and can include the size and complexity of systems and their connections to other systems of importance. And capabilities can include technical capabilities such as programming skill within the environment.\nThe capabilities matrix included below is overly simplified, yet it indicates a host of areas where the intelligence community can provide significant assistance to decision-makers. What is important to consider is that these capabilities are not limited to the United States or its allies. Capabilities need to be assessed on a nation-by-nation basis and on a substate basis as well. These and many other unmentioned cyber capabilities combine to provide an accurate picture of the battlespace.\nIdentifying the capabilities and political situation of a new battlespace is difficult under the best of circumstances. Cyber is immensely complicated and therefore necessitates a logical template within which to examine capabilities. There is a need for a differentiation between the domestic (defensive) and the foreign (offensive) battlespace. This distinction is important both for tasking and decision-making. When the two battlespaces are separated, they are able to inform one another. Table 7.2 highlights many of the primary areas for consideration within the two battlespaces necessary for DBA and DBK.\nThe INTs above can and should be focused on these and related areas within the cyber domain. A holistic picture of the above components of the domain will\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER SEVEN\nTABLE 7.2 Components of Cyber DBA and DBK\n|  Domestic (Defense Oriented) | Foreign (Offense Oriented)  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  Policy considerations (offensive & defensive) | Policy considerations (offensive & defensive)  |\n|  Domestic network mapping | Foreign network mapping  |\n|  Budget allocations | Budget allocations  |\n|  ICT collaboration (alliances, partnerships) | Offensive unit size & training  |\n|  Defensive unit size & training | Defensive unit size & training  |\n|  Critical infrastructure | Critical infrastructure  |\n|  Insider threats for defensive purposes | Insider threats for offensive purposes  |\n|  Threat spectrum capabilities | Historical record of attack and defense  |\n|  Known vulnerabilities | Threat spectrum capabilities  |\n|  Time to attack recognition | Known vulnerabilities  |\n|  Time to attack attribution | ICT collaborations (alliances, partnerships)  |\n|  Systemic dependencies | Time to attack recognition  |\n|  Monitoring | Time to attack attribution  |\n|   | Systemic dependencies  |\n|   | Surveillance  |\n|   | Reconnaissance  |\nprovide decision-makers with a clearer visualization of the battlespace. Again, following Waltz, a visualization of any battlespace includes the following:\n1. Developing a clear understanding of the state with relation to the enemy and environment.\n2. Envisioning a desired goal or objective representing the successful completion of the mission.\n3. Visualization of the sequence of activities that move the current state to the desired state.[30]\nEdward Amoroso argues the intelligence community should focus on creating an addition to the conventional intelligence briefs that consist solely of information pertaining to cyber.[31] Amoroso indicates such a report should focus on current security posture, top and new security risks, automated metrics, and human interpretation. Amoroso's case for the creation of a cyber-specific intelligence brief is sound and works toward promoting an accurate and realistic understanding of the threats and opportunities within this new and evolving domain relevant to national security.\n# POLICY CONSIDERATIONS\nThe Joint Chiefs of Staff have placed an increasing emphasis on the cyber domain within various joint doctrine publications. Joint doctrines provide insight into the needs of the services and policy-makers in the employment of and defense against cyber attacks. Documents also include many of the ways cyber\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nThe Role of Intelligence in Cyberspace [113]\nhas come to rely heavily on intelligence assets. Information superiority has become a mission critical aspect of defending national security. The Department of Defense's \"Joint Doctrine for Command and Control Warfare\" dating back to 1996 highlights the importance of intelligence products in support of C2W. The document indicates the use of intelligence assists in the conceptualization of all aspects of a battlespace.\nComprehension of any battlespace, including the cyber domain, requires understanding the policy environment in which an action occurs. Is there a national cyber defense strategy within the targeted country? How have they publicly or privately declared they would respond to hostile acts within the cyber domain? An example of the policy environment can be found in the \"Department of Defense Strategy for Operating in Cyberspace.\" The strategy outlines five strategic initiatives in its declassified report:\nStrategic Initiative 1: Treat cyberspace as an operational domain to organize, train, and equip so that DoD can take full advantage of cyberspace's potential\nStrategic Initiative 2: Employ new defense operating concepts to protect DoD networks and systems\nStrategic Initiative 3: Partner with other U.S. government departments and agencies and the private sector to enable a whole-of-government cyber security strategy\nStrategic Initiative 4: Build robust relationships with U.S. allies and international partners to strengthen collective cyber security\nStrategic Initiative 5: Leverage the nation's ingenuity through an exceptional cyber workforce and rapid technological innovation\nThe recently declassified sections of the report cited in the media indicate a doctrinal shift in the way the DoD approaches the cyber domain. The Wall Street Journal reports that DoD sources as early as 2011 indicated that some instances of cyber attacks can constitute an act of war.[32] This has further developed as recently as September 2014 with the NATO pledge for mutual defense in the event of significant cyber attacks that might result in the invocation of Article 5.[33] When asked what constitutes an act of war in cyberspace that would rise to a level that would result in the successful invocation of Article 5 for mutual defense, NATO secretary general Rasmussen said that the goal was to achieve \"strategic ambiguity\" to keep adversaries guessing and to act as \"ambiguous deterrence.\"[34]\nAlthough the current position on what constitutes an act of war in cyberspace within the eyes of the United States and NATO remains uncertain, understanding the policy positions within the domestic battlespace and in the foreign battlespace helps alleviate information asymmetries and establish clearly identifiable patterns for response. Whether it is the knowledge that Germany and the Netherlands both have official cyber security doctrines or that China has begun implementing a policy of making offensive cyber capabilities a strategic priority,\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER SEVEN\nthe overt and covert collection of policy positions provides policy-makers with a foundation for understanding intelligence related to cyber.\nPolicy platforms also help to codify international law, to create zones of norms or an identifiable policy framework in which states will interact or respond to incidents emanating from cyberspace.³⁵ While both the United States and Russia have made known a cyber attack could constitute an act of war, there has been little elaboration on specific characteristics of such an attack within the official policy-making circles of government. Often states will intentionally leave room for policy ambiguity as a mechanism of deterrence.³⁶ Understanding ambiguity, information gaps, and information asymmetry is crucial particularly in comprehending how leaders arrive at decisions. As in conventional warfare, in cyber conflict the minimization of or the knowledge about what a potential adversary will do in a given situation provides a strategic edge. Although there has been little in the form of codified policy delineation on what level of cyber attack would constitute an act of war, the academic community has been heavily engaged in attempting to apply existing legal frameworks to the cyber domain. The most notable work in this arena is the Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare, which works through in rigorous detail how actions within cyberspace could fall within existing international law.³⁷ Yet as rigorous as the work is, there is no single government required to adhere to its findings on the applicability of international law, and even within the laws themselves there was a significant amount of debate as to what constituted various levels of action in cyberspace. Instead of thinking of sponsored academic works such as the Tallinn Manual as clear policies to which states should adhere, they should be instead thought of as roadmaps to guide states in developing policies.\n# CE—NETWORK MAPPING, SYSTEMIC DEPENDENCIES, AND HISTORICAL RECORDS\nUnderstanding the policy environment both domestically and among foreign adversaries is only part of the larger intelligence process. Cyber exploitation (CE) constitutes a series of technological and analytical approaches to cyber-specific espionage. CE for the purposes of conventional intelligence collection can include the penetration of foreign networks to secure information on weapons systems, policy positions, and much more. CE is invasive yet does not disrupt, deny, or destroy data; it collects data. When CE operations focus intelligence on the cyber domain for offensive and defensive purposes, the objective is to understand the systems themselves. The goal becomes identifying the strengths and weaknesses of systems, the connectivity of systems to points of interests, and the interaction of those systems with strategic and tactical objectives.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nThe Role of Intelligence in Cyberspace [115]\nThere are numerous methods of CE; for the purposes of simplicity only a few are examined here. Network mapping is a form of CE that studies the physical connectivity of networks or the availability of insecure ports. This type of mapping provides information on what types of systems and servers operate on different networks and identifies the characteristics of the various component parts these systems constitute. Network mapping can drill down to very low levels on particular networks and provide significant information speed and types of hardware on various networks. This information can also be used to isolate portions of networks to identify potential heavy traffic users or other sources of potential exploitation.\nNetwork mapping is also useful for illustrating the potential for any particular targeted attack to extend beyond its intended target and result in collateral damage or blowback. Conceptually network mapping is not dissimilar from attempting to map radar or surface-to-air missile locations prior to a bombing campaign. The intent of network mapping is to gain an operational knowledge of an adversary's systems prior to engaging in an OCO.\nForensic analysis of the Stuxnet worm found the worm partially employed network mapping to target its attacks, focusing on isolated networks using memory sticks as the initial method of transmission.[38] Once in, Stuxnet focused its attack on networks with programmable logic controllers (PLCs) of a specific type and caused uranium enrichment centrifuges to malfunction.[39] The level of sophistication required to drill down to get to this level of detail to plan an attack is remarkable, particularly considering the complexity and number of overall systems and the air-gapped nature of the systems.\nNetwork mapping is both an offensive and defensive intelligence endeavor. To adequately prepare both the defensive and offensive battlespaces, an accurate picture of systems is needed. Arguably the dual domestic-foreign pictures are complementary and help avoid violating part 2.13 of Executive Order 12333, which prevents any covert action from influencing U.S. political processes, public opinion, policies, media, or various sections of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.[40]\nNetwork mapping and monitoring is a double-edged sword. Legally network mapping can be considered CE, and therefore domestic network mapping by U.S. intelligence agencies without a warrant would be prohibited. However, network mapping is of critical importance to the maintenance of national security infrastructures. Thus far the intelligence community does not have a formal commitment from the White House or the Justice Department to engage in any domestic CE operations.[41] Currently in the United States there is an uneasy and inefficient public-private commitment to providing information on network security across critical infrastructure. A thorough understanding of domestic and foreign networks assists in visualization for both offensive and defensive\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER SEVEN\npurposes, and effort to push reasoned analysis of threats has begun to make its way into Congress.⁴²\nNetwork mapping assists in the identification of network components. Once network components are known, it becomes necessary to explore vulnerabilities within systems. Most damaging are zero-day vulnerabilities, which are vulnerabilities in computer applications of which even system administrators are unaware. The Stuxnet attack exposed several zero-day vulnerabilities in the Windows software controlling/monitoring the programmable logic controllers, causing the attached centrifuges to spin outside of their safe operational standards.\nSystemic vulnerabilities necessitate a thorough understanding of the historical record of different types of attacks and exploits. The identification of zero-day vulnerabilities should lead network administrators to immediately patch these gaps. Intelligence plays a role in identifying what types of attacks have been used in the past and what vulnerabilities these attacks attempted to exploit. Historical accounting is important for both offensive and defensive preparation of the battlespace. For obvious reasons it is important to prevent repeat attacks on domestic systems; at the same time it is important not to engage in repeat attack methods once a vulnerability on an opposing system has been fixed. Such an attack would likely be ineffective and lead to anonymity-attribution problems.\nThe historical accounting of attack types by countries and substate actors also alerts operators within the intelligence and military community to the threat spectrum capabilities of a particular cyber adversary. Understanding the threat spectrum capabilities of states facilitates an accurate conceptualization of their power to operate within the domain. Table 7.3 is a representation of known threat spectrum capabilities.\nThe above areas of consideration within CE are only a small sampling of the overall tasking priorities for intelligence using CE methods. They hint at a broad applicability for CYBERINT methods in the preparation of the battlespace.\n# CONVENTIONAL INTELLIGENCE\nIntelligence collected on budgetary allocations, offensive and defensive cyber unit sizes, and training methodologies provides the clearest parallel to conventional intelligence. As in conventional intelligence, most countries are frequently unwilling to release data on absolute military expenditures or the sizes and force structures within their military. Military capabilities are a closely guarded secret in most countries. Capabilities are particularly secretive in the cyber domain. Often if cyber capabilities are exposed, they cease to be capabilities.⁴³ Once Stuxnet was discovered by the Iranians, defensive measures were taken to \"plug\" the holes the Stuxnet attack employed. This dramatically reduces\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nTABLE 7.3 Cyber Threat Spectrum\n|  Levels (Types) of Attack | Description | Feasibility | Complexity  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  Propaganda | The propagation of information via the Internet to affect public, private, or governmental opinion.

Whereas missiles can be launched with repeated success because the ability to defend against a moving projectile is difficult, a similar cyber weapon is more easily defended against once it has been identified. Antivirus software can be reprogrammed to identify and isolate repeat threats, and zero-day vulnerabilities can be patched.\nAn excellent example of an open source analysis of cyber capabilities comes from Stokes, Lin, and Hsiao, who examine in explicit detail the construction, location, leadership, and mission of many aspects of the Chinese People's Liberation Army information warfare programs.⁴⁴ Their report is an example of a high-value detailed analysis that could be supplemented by conventional intelligence to enhance policy-maker and combatant commander comprehension of the battlespace. The detailed analysis of the location and force structure can cause an enemy to shift its tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and make them less reliable. Alternatively, not revealing that information has been gained on TTPs can provide an offensive edge in cyber operations.\nThe implications for conventional intelligence collection methods indicate that intelligence on cyber does not necessarily need to remain cyberbound or exclusively within the realm of CE. Many metrics such as force size matter in cyber and can be examined to create a better assessment of potential adversaries. Cyber force size is particularly important from a malware development perspective. Complex coding scripts typically necessitate large numbers of programmers to develop and test the scripts. The ability for an individual to accomplish highly complex attacks is possible but less likely than a large cyber warfare unit working with the same objective.\nLikewise, knowing where a unit is located or how programmers were trained can help planners determine the best response to a particular attack, or how best to manipulate their organizational structure. Derek Clark and Kai Konrad refer to this as identifying the weakest link.⁴⁵ The identification of the weakest link is particularly important in cyber defense and offense. There are multiple fronts (systems) needing defense. All it takes is one \"best shot\" to achieve significant damage. While this weakest link can be identified through CE operations outlined in the previous section, it can also be identified within the training, command, and organizational structure of units charged with conducting or protecting against cyber attacks.\nClosely related to the conventional military metrics above, yet likely unique to the cyber domain, are public-private ICT collaborations. Although most countries have programs for military public and private collaborations with universities and businesses for research and development, within the cyber domain the importance of this relationship is magnified for multiple reasons. First, much of the training and education necessary to conduct offensive or defensive oper\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nThe Role of Intelligence in Cyberspace [119]\nations within cyberspace can be learned at public institutions or can be crafted for private sector use. This extends far beyond the development of technology to the actual training of the warfighter, the development of the platforms upon which the domain rests, and more. Second, these collaborations spread out but do not diffuse potential vulnerabilities.\nBecause collaborations can form the foundational aspects of the cyber warriors within offensive and defensive units, they can train, equip, and prepare in ways far different from conventional military means. Most countries have a balance between civilian and military protection of their national cyber infrastructures based largely on the development of computer emergency response teams (CERTs). An intelligence assessment of the strength and quality of ICT collaborations is of critical importance in understanding the cyber battlespace.\nICT collaborations are not necessarily official and do not need to be highly structured and regimented. Alexander Klimburg provides evidence Russia and China have created groups of plausibly deniable cyber attackers.[46] Creating an accurate open source measure of unofficial collaborations is difficult. An intelligence focus on unofficial collaborations with entities can contextualize cyber incidents such as the 2007 cyber attacks directed at Estonian governmental, bank, and communications websites.[47] The attacks were motivated by a decision to move a Russian war memorial from central Tallinn. While initial reports indicated Russia was the culprit, Russia denied any participation in the cyber attacks.[48] The reality is somewhat murkier and more akin to an unofficial sanction or condoning of cyber attacks by the Russian government.[49]\nThe collection and production of intelligence on more conventional attributes of pertinence to the cyber domain is a role in which the intelligence community is likely already engaged. Occasionally reports on issues relating to this category of intelligence are published for public consumption. A recent report of this type was produced for the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission to examine China's capability to conduct cyber warfare and cyber exploitation.[50] Knowledge of capabilities is still applicable to the cyber domain and is greatly influenced by conventional intelligence collection methods and subsequent analysis, which contextualizes the meaning of raw intelligence.\n## HUMINT AND CYBER\nHuman intelligence (HUMINT) stands out in cyber for two particular reasons. First, HUMINT agents can provide accurate internal information on systems and access to those systems unavailable through CE and other intelligence collection methods. Second, human assets can serve as a bridge between the external world and air-gapped or other forms of secure networks. As was indicated above, it is likely that the Stuxnet virus was distributed using a thumb drive,\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER SEVEN\nwhich needed to be inserted into a machine within an air-gapped network. HUMINT agents can serve as a vulnerability against which most network administrators will be unable to provide significant protection.\nThe role of a HUMINT asset with access to information on networks can be extremely damaging. Even if the agent is on a lightly classified network, the repercussions of his or her actions can be enormous. The scandal caused by Bradley Manning (now named Chelsea Manning) leaking more than 260,000 diplomatic cables to WikiLeaks in 2010 is illustrative of the problem posed by internal threats.⁵¹ Manning’s leak and the even more damaging 2013 document releases by Edward Snowden, a former employee of a contractor affiliated with both the NSA and CIA, highlight the potential damage a rogue employee can have on the ability of the intelligence community to keep information secret.⁵² Snowden’s insider collection and subsequent release of documents pertaining to the National Security Agency likely constitutes one of the most significant intelligence leaks of all time and resulted in an estimated 1.7 million documents being released in violation of U.S. classification law.⁵³ Moreover, unlike the leaks by Manning, the Snowden leaks revealed many of the TTPs used by the NSA in its intelligence operations in the cyber domain. These revelations have been extremely damaging and have resulted in changes in the way adversaries safeguard their cyber infrastructure.\nHUMINT threats need to be developed and enhanced for offensive intelligence and protected against for domestic national security counterintelligence. Gaining access to the technical schematics, documents, information, login procedures, or any of a multitude of other targets of intelligence a HUMINT asset could provide is a critical aspect added directly by intelligence to the understanding of the cyber domain. Furthermore, HUMINT agents are almost impossible to detect under normal circumstances as they can often engage in significant espionage while still easily performing the normal duties. Unlike the spy thriller days of old when agents had to sneak out of a building with classified documents in a folder or a box, they can often place thousands or millions of documents on a solid-state drive and easily conceal it upon exiting a facility. Many of these drives are smaller in size than a penny.\nBeyond the collection of intelligence from HUMINT sources, these insiders can assist in the implementation of cyber actions. Information within a 2005 report by the U.S. Secret Service in cooperation with Carnegie Mellon indicated that up to 29 percent of all attacks against a surveyed group of critical infrastructure stakeholders were initiated by insiders.⁵⁴ The majority of motivations behind these attacks were not related to intelligence or covert action. This, however, does not preclude the possibility of using insiders to affect or gain information or access on adversary systems. The recruitment and maintenance of insider threats by the intelligence community should be a top priority. These\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nThe Role of Intelligence in Cyberspace\nFIGURE 7.1 Timeline for Attack Implementation\nagents can offer a mission a critical component, often during times when more lengthy intelligence collection processes are constrained by events.\n# TIME FOR ATTACK RECOGNITION, COMPLETION, AND ATTRIBUTION\nAttack recognition and attribution are also critical for both a defensive and offensive battlespace planning. All of the intelligence collection methods and the focus of the intel process of trying to comprehend the cyber domain culminate in understanding, from a mission critical orientation, the progression of cyber attacks. Figure 7.1 is a simplified model for understanding attack planning and progression within a battlespace modeled loosely on the JP 3-51 electronic warfare-planning model.[55] This model is informed by intelligence collection. Line one of the figure indicates a policy-maker's perspective on the process of engaging in conflict. A conflict initiation is (o) planned, (1) implemented, and (2) completed. Policy-makers want to know what resources any given action will take and how long it will take to complete it. In cyber a more accurate timeline for action in cyberspace requires (o) intelligence collection, (1) operational planning of the attack with an informed knowledge of the battlespace, (2) understanding of the time it takes for the attack to be completed, (3) how long until the attack is recognized as an attack by the adversary, (4) how long until that adversary can do something about the attack, (5) how long until the adversary assigns attribution for the attack. The ordering of the items listed above greatly affects the ability for an attack to be conducted successfully. Intelligence informs the policy-maker and commander as to the feasibility of a particular type of attack and the probability of success. If recognition of an attack occurs early in the timeline of events the probability of success is diminished.\nThe timeline can be tested in much the same way conventional weapons are tested. It would be absurd to send a bomber over a potential target with a completely untested bomb, or to send a soldier into battle with an untested model of rifle. Just as weapons are tested in the physical world, they need to be tested in the cyber domain as well. This testing provides added information to both\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER SEVEN\nFIGURE 7.2 The Influence of Intelligence on Cyber Operations\nModified from E. Waltz, Information Warfare.\nthe policy-maker and the combatant commander as to the effectiveness of the weapon and the timeline of events above. If a cyber weapon is slow and easily detectable, its probability for success is diminished. This lowered probability for success does not nullify its use but does condition it.\nOne aspect of this phase of IPB is that it is extremely beneficial to both the offensive and defensive strategic and tactical operations. By planning and testing potential attacks against theoretical adversarial systems, the intelligence community provides an out-of-the-box perspective necessary to prevent similar attacks against domestic targets. This logic would indicate an attempt to use a worm like Stuxnet against the U.S. infrastructure would run into greater problems than if the weapon had been developed first elsewhere.\n# IPB AND ITS IMPACT ON CYBER\nThe role of intelligence in cyber is not dissimilar from its role in the conventional domains. There are new areas in which collection and analysis need to occur, yet its overall objective remains the same. Returning to Edward Waltz's concept of information preparation of the battlefield, figure 7.2 illustrates intelligence's influence on operations originating within the cyber domain. The role of intelligence in cyber is to accurately facilitate an understanding of those\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nThe Role of Intelligence in Cyberspace [123]\nentities and the possible tools by which to influence them. The cyber domain is surrounded with hype and hysteria. Many of the claims are accurately based in reality. But the known unknowns are still enormous within this evolving domain, and it is incumbent on intelligence to provide an accurate assessment of the current state of affairs.\nAll-source intelligence for cyber operations requires the intelligence community to think beyond domestic system defense. The focus should be balanced between foreign and domestic intelligence, thereby mutually informing one another and creating a systemic defense for national assets in addition to better facilitating decision-makers with a more accurate picture of how a potential cyber attack might succeed or fail.\n# CYBER AS COVERT ACTION\nTo further define the role of intelligence in cyber, it is necessary to look more deeply into the laws codifying the conduct of the intelligence community. All of the above sections provide a framework for defining the role of intelligence with regard to IPB. Cyber conflict is, by its very nature, covert. Even if an attack is discovered, it is often unattributable. Attacks can be designed to go unnoticed and affect changes to systems and their components for days, weeks, or months without detection. Even in instances where groups such as Anonymous publically take credit for attacks, responsibility is typically claimed post hoc. Nearly all examples of state-on-state cyber attacks have been covert.\nThe covert nature of cyber brings full circle Warner's definition of intelligence as attempting to influence. Covert action is a secret operation to influence a foreign entity. At least in theory, most, if not all, cyber attacks begin covertly. Section 1.7(a)(4) of Executive Order 12333 regarding intelligence activities describes covert action:\nConduct convert action activities approved by the President. No agency except the Central Intelligence Agency (or the Armed Forces of the United States in time of war declared by the Congress or during any period covered by a report from the President to the Congress consistent with the War Powers Resolution, Public Law 93-148) may conduct any covert action activity unless the President determines that another agency is more likely to achieve a particular objective.[56]\nEvident in the early structuring of the governmental approach to cyberspace is the categorization of cyber operations as covert actions. The Department of Defense originally took the lead with General Keith Alexander as the head of both NSA and Cyber Command, a path that has continued now that Admiral Michael Rogers has taken over as the head of both organizations. This indicates the president has established an agency other than the Central Intelligence\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER SEVEN\nAgency as the primary covert operator within this domain. While the logic behind having a military intelligence organization commander and an organizational structure that falls under the U.S. Strategic Command (STRATCOM) runs counter to EO 12333, the institutional capacity of the DoD in the technical domain and the scale of the problem being faced within this new domain make the assignment appropriate.\n# SUMMARIZING THE ROLE OF INTELLIGENCE WITHIN THE CYBER DOMAIN\nIn defining the role of intelligence within the cyber domain, it is necessary to take a holistic approach. From a collection perspective, the intelligence community should be and has been working in coordination with a hybrid push-and-pull intelligence cycle to both elevate the importance of this domain and facilitate collection within it. The emphasis has been heavily defensive up to this point and largely focused on countering threats rather than anticipating them. This needs to change, and the only way this can change is if the intelligence community begins to actively turn its sights on adversaries and develop more rigorous all-source intelligence combining novel CYBERINT technologies to augment reporting on this domain. Parroting Amoroso's assertion, cyber should be included on the daily intelligence briefs of policy-makers. The inclusion would likely start the process of demystification of this immensely complicated domain.\nCyberspace is a domain that can be used to fulfill all aspects of Warner's definition of intelligence to some degree. It is a domain in which it is possible to gain understanding about other states beyond and within the domain itself, but it is also a domain that can influence other states' policy decisions as well as perceptions. In particular, accurate intelligence on both sides of the domestic-foreign divide can mutually inform decision-makers about vulnerabilities and the eventual decision to use cyber as an offensive weapon or how best to defend against attacks. Moreover, intelligence can rein in the debate on cyber to a more realistic area of operations predicated on sound estimates rather than on grandiose speculation.\nThe intelligence community itself commonly is the point of origin for OCOs emanating from the cyber domain and will likely serve as a force multiplier in instances where a combined conventional cyber attack is necessary. To engage in cyber conflict, just as in conventional conflict, intelligence is needed to prepare the battlespace and facilitate an accurate assessment of the probability for success and utility for any type of operation. This preparation hones the weapons, decisions, and effect of a potential operation. More importantly for national security, a thorough and accurate preparation of both the foreign and domestic battlespaces will serve to inform and enhance cyber security.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms",

Intelligence is increasingly facilitating information superiority through an understanding of the cyber domain. The Department of Defense's \"Joint Vision 2020\" establishes the goal of information superiority on the battlefield. This information superiority enables decision superiority and favorably tilts the strategic and tactical balance. Information superiority is built on cyber power, scale and complexity of attacks, robustness of defense, policy positions, systemic vulnerabilities and dependencies, and actor anonymity and attribution issues. Intelligence plays a mission critical role in assessing these characteristics. The discussion below examines the role of intelligence in identifying these characteristics within the cyber domain and examines how it influences the decision-making of policy-makers. Specifically the focus hones in on how intelligence increases the effectiveness of identifying potential attackers within the cyber domain and informs the decision-making of policy-makers when engaging in covert cyber action directed against a potential adversary. The discussion is designed to serve as a strategic framework in which to understand the role of intelligence within the cyber domain.\nIs it really necessary to examine the role of intelligence within the cyber domain as contextually different than in a conventional domain? The short answer is yes. Cyber necessitates independent examination because it is characteristically different, and yet at the same time it is a pervasive feature affecting outcomes within other domains. What differentiates cyber from land, sea, air, and space are three fundamental attributes relevant to intelligence practitioners. First, the cyber domain is a man-made domain. Second, military capabilities across the other domains are managed through the cyber domain. Third, military and civilian aspects of the cyber domain are often intertwined and difficult to differentiate. These attributes pose unique opportunities and problems for intelligence officials.\nThe man-made nature of the cyber domain makes it a largely virtual domain with its value corresponding to the speed and volume of information contained\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER SEVEN\nwithin it. However, the cyber domain is not entirely virtual and has numerous real-world connection points to everything from industrial control systems of power and water management facilities to the weapon systems of drones flying above distant battlefields.\nCyberspace is not tangible in the same way as more conventional domains and therefore necessitates a new form of dynamic intelligence evolving from all-source collection of conventional and novel intelligence sources. A recent National Research Council report states that intelligence in the cyber domain is useful for both strategic and tactical purposes.¹ The strategic and tactical importance of intelligence's role in influencing the cyber domain falls within the concept of all-source intelligence. Loch Johnson defines all-source intelligence as one of the fundamental propositions of a theory of strategic intelligence.² More importantly for the purposes of understanding the operational and political environments within which offensive and defensive actions in cyberspace can occur, it is necessary to understand what intelligence is within decisions regarding the cyber domain and how intelligence influences those decisions.\n## DEFINING INTELLIGENCE\nThere are dozens of different definitions of intelligence, each of which is in some way applicable to understanding cyber action. One of the more succinct and conceptually ordered comes from Michael Warner, who defines intelligence as a \"secret, state activity to understand or influence foreign entities.\"³ His definition establishes the fundamental premises of both collection and analysis, while including actions designed to influence. Intelligence is vital to the cyber domain because foreign entities are increasingly storing, managing, and directing their governmental, public, private, and military functions in a digitized world.\nThe traditional intelligence collection types (INTs) are still of immense value, yet they must be combined with aspects of the digitized target spectrum to provide a holistic view of both threats and opportunities. At present the majority of studies in the public domain have focused on defense.⁴ This defensive posture is made clear by General Keith Alexander, the director of the National Security Agency and commander of United States Cyber Command, when he writes: \"US Cyber Command's efforts and planning aim to ensure that the DoD has done all it can to defend and deter determined adversaries, mitigate dangerous threats, and address nagging vulnerabilities, so that even our most capable opponents will know that interfering with our nation's equities in cyberspace is a losing proposition.\"⁵\nThis defensive and deterrent-reliant posture is limiting and prone to inadequacies. Echoing Machiavelli and to some extent Sun Tzu, the adage \"the best defense is a good offense\" offers a novel way of considering action and intelli\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nThe Role of Intelligence in Cyberspace [103]\ngence within cyber. More accurately, it allows for a systematic approach to both national cyber defensive and offensive resource allocations. Beyond the efficiency argument for shifting the focus from solely defense to a balance between defense and offense, intelligence collection can help to inform offensive strategies and the decision to use cyber as a weapon. The role of intelligence within cyber becomes increasingly important when considering the difficulty of achieving any significant measure of deterrence within the cyber domain.⁶\nThe defensive orientation of the majority of cyber literature has a constraining effect on decision-making processes for the use of offensive cyber weapons. This defensive focus is largely due to both the alarmist calls of some scholars and policy-makers and an information communications technologies industry orientation offering many more strategies for defense than for offense. While I do not dispute the need for defense, this defensive focus leads the national security establishment down a path of attempting to create an impenetrable system. If there is one thing that is abundantly clear in the cyber domain it is that the only impenetrable system is the one that has not been made. Cyber is based on physics and algorithms. The mathematics and science behind security measures can be immensely complex and take massive computing power to penetrate, but that does not make them impenetrable. Even the most robust systems secured with checks and encryptions are still highly vulnerable to their users' ignorance or malice, as was the case with Edward Snowden in 2013.\nInstead of focusing on a solely carte blanche defensive posture toward cyber security, intelligence can provide both an offensive and defensive picture more effective at safeguarding national security. Taking a step back from the conventional cyber security literature, intelligence can direct cyber security efforts to not merely safeguard national security but also provide an offensive tool for use against other states. The vast literature on intelligence, ranging from the way intelligence influences the policy-making process to how it helps to understand aspects of the development of utility for actions, serves as a guide in defining the role of intelligence within the cyber domain.\nReflecting on Warner's definition of intelligence, the spectrum of intelligence collection methods—from human intelligence (HUMINT) to the more technical collection methods of signals intelligence (SIGINT), measurement and signatures intelligence (MASINT), geospatial intelligence (GEOINT), and open source intelligence (OSINT)—works together in an all-source environment to provide an accurate understanding of foreign entities. (Table 7.1 provides a quick definitional reference for the various intelligence collection types.) The understanding provided by intelligence has largely focused on the conventional domains and on political decision-making. However, as decisions in conventional domains increasingly migrate toward cyberspace, and the systems controlling the tools used in these domains increasingly become digitally connected, the\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER SEVEN\nTABLE 7.1 Intelligence Collection Methods\n|  Intelligence Source Type | Definition  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  Open Source (OSINT) | Overtly available information found, selected, and acquired from publicly available source.  |\n|  Measurement and Signatures (MASINT) | Intelligence detected and classified from targets that identify or describe signatures (distinctive characteristics) of fixed or dynamic target sources.  |\n|  Human (HUMINT) | Intelligence collected through interpersonal contact via human collection officers.  |\n|  Geospatial (GEOINT)* | The exploitation and analysis of imagery and geospatial information to describe, assess, and visually depict physical features and geographically referenced activities on the earth.

Williams, Shimeal, and Dunlevy, \"Intelligence Analysis for Internet Security.\" CYBERINT is considered independent of traditional SIGINT. However, as in many of the other types of intelligence collection, techniques and agencies often overlap.\nimportance of understanding the technical schematics and decision processes becomes vital to national security.\nNick Cullather, in an article on digital connections on the battlefield, indicates significant advances in the development of network-centric warfare. Cullather notes that the rise of a \"revolution in military affairs\" has largely not been matched by the intelligence community's ability to keep up.[7] This is of particular importance when looking beyond the network-centric battlefield of conventional weapons to the new zone of confrontation within cyberspace itself. Similarly, Michael Herman finds that counterterrorism intelligence analysis requires a broad spectrum of information sources brought together.[8] ICT facilitates the mitigation of \"stovepipes\" and increases the efficiency in information transference.[9] Information transmission has also been facilitated following the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 by the creation of \"fusion centers.\"[10] ICT has a role to play not only in the conduct of war on the battlefield, but also in the management of a conventional traditional threat spectrum within the fusion centers and beyond in the wider intelligence community.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nThe Role of Intelligence in Cyberspace [105]\nTerrorism is not commonly regarded as part of the conventional threat spectrum, yet in reality most terrorist acts take place in the physical world and require bombs and guns. However, the information coordination necessary to organize, plan, and conduct warfare, terrorist acts, and political strategies has largely shifted to cyberspace. The 2008 Mumbai terrorist attacks are a poignant example of terrorists leveraging technology and open source intelligence collected from public sites and software such as Google Earth to plan and orchestrate mass murder.[11] As horrific as the use of digital tools for planning attacks is, it is not isolated to open source intelligence collection via tools. Terrorists also use open source cryptography and crypto-currencies to finance their operations.[12] Intelligence agencies are in a competition with other states and organizations to leverage tools effectively to prevent attacks by terrorists and to mitigate international incidents before they arise.\nWhile open source research is fundamentally more powerful than ever before, available open source information provides only a limited aperture to realistically size up threats and targets within cyberspace itself. The problem of intelligence in cyberspace is massive both in terms of scale and complexity of data. Joel Brenner, a former inspector general of the National Security Agency and head of U.S. counterintelligence, indicated there has been an enormous threat emanating from within cyberspace that is not being adequately addressed.[13]\nModern warfare, command and control warfare (C2W), is network centric. Large swaths of the national critical infrastructures in states that pose conventional security and economic threats to the United States are controlled by digital systems. The literature is less focused on the need for understanding these vulnerabilities than it is on safeguarding them. The defensive focus, to a large degree, overshadows the development of offensive capabilities.\nPhil Williams, Timothy Shimeal, and Casey Dunlevy make a well-reasoned case arguing for focused intelligence efforts on identifying threats to national cyber security.[14] These authors make a valid point that needs to be addressed and is being addressed by several national strategy documents on the topic, including the National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace and the \"International Strategy for Cyberspace.\" One report of particular importance addressing many of the issues brought up by Williams, Shimeal, and Dunlevy is the October 2011 report by the Office of the National Counterintelligence Executive on cyber espionage.[15] A broad spectrum of federal strategies and reports has made identification and protection against vulnerabilities a top priority. More recently the president of the United States under Executive Order 13636 in February 2013 directed the government to begin actively seeking out and planning strategies to mitigate cyber threats to national critical infrastructure.\nThis is a process that is under way and includes an alphabet soup of agencies from across the civilian and military spectrum of the government. A re\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER SEVEN\ncurrent problem that keeps cropping up in many of the discussions on critical infrastructure is network awareness. Many companies and firms affiliated with critical infrastructure do not have an adequate understanding of their own vulnerabilities, let alone how they interact to create systemic threats. One industry based on personal communications and working experience that seems to be working very hard to address these issues is the U.S. financial sector, which in many ways is pioneering cyber security efforts under E.O. 13636.\nCurrently most cyber security is based on attacks or incidents in progress or that have already occurred. It is difficult, if not impossible, to defend against an unknown attack. Much of the effort in the United States cyber community now seems to be equivalent to plugging the holes in the dike after it floods. It is a fact that most cyber attacks are repeat attacks originating at the lower end of the threat spectrum, making the strategy of filling holes in the dike an absolute necessity in an effort to prevent repeat intrusions from identical or similar malware types. Yet this post hoc strategy largely fails to address the more serious problem of accurately anticipating what the next type of attack is going to be. This strategy, best referred to as a \"Maginot Line\" strategy, is prone to failure in areas where technological and strategic capabilities rapidly evolve. The real challenge is to develop intelligence-based approaches to cyberspace that prevent future attacks before they happen.\nThere is a significant and sustained effort underway on the defensive side of the cyber debate within the DoD to develop better security. The DoD is currently employing at least three categories of defensive teams to facilitate DoD network protection: DoD information network operations teams (DoDIN Ops), defensive cyber operations—internal defensive measures teams (DCO-IDM or cyber protection teams), and defensive cyber operations—response action teams (DCO-RA or national mission teams).[16] Yet all of these teams are heavily reliant on intelligence on the cyber environment for defense (ICE-D). The teams that fit into these categories are tasked with segments of the overall problem. While the DoDIN-Ops teams are tasked with ensuring sustained secure operations on DoD networks, they are not focused on adversary behaviors in those networks. Their work is informed by adversary behaviors but seeks to maintain network security in aggregate. DCO-IDM or cyber protection teams function as hunter killers within the network. They are tasked with seeking out individuals engaging DoD networks illegally and stopping the attacks or exploits. DCO-RA or national mission teams are tasked with responding to adversary behavior in DoD networks. As should be readily apparent, the problem is enormous and relies on intelligence for all aspects of ICE-D functions. The DoD network environment alone is composed of millions of computing devices and users.\nBecause we exist in a world of known unknowns and unknown unknowns, to paraphrase Secretary Rumsfeld, cyber security is likely the former rather than\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nThe Role of Intelligence in Cyberspace [107]\nthe latter.¹⁷ How can intelligence be used to improve the cyber security situation not only to protect the national infrastructure in a more systematic and logical manner but also to use this information to inform the decision-making processes of policy-makers?\nOne problem associated with the U.S. cyber community is proximity. Because the community develops, tests, and employs its own tools, it is unable to take into account methods of testing that have not yet threatened systems in the past. This is an in-the-box, out-of-the-box, forget-the-box problem. The designers of systems, software, and networks are talented and smart individuals; they lead the world in technical innovation, yet because they are inside their own systems, it becomes it intrinsically difficult to isolate unforeseen problems. United States Cyber Command and various other teams from the services and the various academies have tried to address this problem by creating competitive cyber teams that compete with one other and against civilian competitors in various challenges such as DefCon capture the flag contests and others. These various DCO and DoDIN-Ops teams also engage one another to consistently foster novel thinking on security.\nYet the challenge is immense, and solutions are best achieved by constant introspection. Below are several proposed strategies to help facilitate the development of improved defensive operations. First, the current orientation toward plugging holes must continue. While this post hoc process is frustrating, it prevents or at least slows further intrusions. The mentality of these DoDIN-Ops is one of defense. The objective is to secure and defend systems against all possible or known types of attacks. The most realistic approach is to defend against known types of attacks. The systems become fortified against repeat incidents or at least can minimize their severity. The work of these teams is not sexy; it is not offense oriented; it is a process of continuous network security development. Second, DCO-IDM teams must also actively hunt in government and defense networks for potential adversaries and leverage information gained through all source intelligence collection and communication with DoDIN-Ops, DCO-RA, and OCO teams to anticipate potential blind spots. These teams must also be regularly rotated to provide them time to think like attackers. Third, DCO-RA teams must leverage all-source intelligence and continuous communications with DCO-IDM and OCO teams to engage adversaries in a defensive posture on foreign networks before they endanger DoD networks. While these teams are in the process of getting organized and established, it is important that these teams have clear interteam communications to mitigate stovepiping. The co-location or consistent rotation of team members would likely facilitate enhanced operational results. The co-location and coordination of members within a team should be of paramount importance as it allows analysts and technicians the opportunity to collaborate and developed a detailed and synergistic understanding of capabilities.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER SEVEN\nThe wider intelligence community must use all-source methods to collect as much intelligence on potential opponents as possible. This means profiling every aspect of other nations' cyber offensive and defensive capabilities. This requires a robust all-source collection methodology. Signals intelligence must look for transmissions and communications as well as spikes in Internet traffic and geo-locate them using IP addresses. These geo-located IP addresses need to be analyzed using satellites and drones to provide accurate geospatial information on the areas in question. Open source intelligence collection should attempt to gain as much publicly available information as possible on areas of interest through legal means. Once all of this information has been compiled and assessed, targeted HUMINT operations should begin working on developing assets within these areas or with connections to these areas. These agents should be recruited for multiple purposes. First, they should be used to secure intelligence on the capabilities of potential adversaries. These capabilities are defined in more detail below. Second, agents should also be recruited to become potential insider threats, a tool of particular importance on air-gapped systems.[18] Third, intelligence agencies should also place an emphasis on cyber exploitation (CE) and attempt to probe and map out network infrastructures, vulnerabilities, and strengths of adversaries. The last point is of importance both from an offensive and defensive strategic orientation.\nAnother major problem with the cyber domain arises out of its systemic complexity. As Williams, Shimeal, and Dunlevy accurately note, cyber defenders often do not have a realistic or accurate picture of their own systems, let alone the systems of adversaries who are attacking them.[19] Following their recommendations, the national security community would be prudent to make use of the principle of knowing yourself. This requires a consistent focus on domestic systems. However, only focusing on domestic systems leads to the \"Maginot Line\" tendency in which it is assumed networks are created to be impenetrable.\n# INTELLIGENCE AND THE CYBER BATTLESPACE\nThe cyber domain is a modern battlespace and necessitates a holistic understanding. To defend against or engage in offensive actions, it is necessary to have an accurate understanding of the operational environment. According to Edward Waltz, any battlespace, whether offensive or defensive, requires a combination of dominant battlespace awareness (DBA) and dominant battlespace knowledge (DBK).[20] The process of identifying what is and is not important to understanding a particular battlespace largely falls to the discretion of policy-makers within the intelligence cycle.\nIn writing about intelligence and decision-making, Stephen Marrin states: \"the intelligence cycle starts with decision-maker information requirements lev\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nThe Role of Intelligence in Cyberspace [109]\nied on intelligence collection capabilities, the processing of collected raw intelligence and transmission of this processed material to analysts who decipher its meaning, and relay that understanding back to the decision-makers.”²¹\nThe decision-maker engages in tasking through a number of different “pull” mechanisms including governmental reports, hearings before Congress, presidential directives, and executive orders. These tasking methods and others combine to facilitate within the intelligence community an accurate understanding of what constitutes the battlespace in the eyes of the policy-maker. Often the planning and direction can be informal requests from the executive or from Congress, and at other times it can come from official strategy documents.\nPrior to 9/11, terrorism was a priority, but the planning and direction of resources had not yet reached a critical mass sufficient to prevent the terrible attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Marrin and others find the intelligence process frequently fails to adequately define what constitutes a tasking priority for the intelligence community, necessitating a “push” from within the community outward. There are many instances in which policy-makers ignore, misinterpret, or misuse intelligence despite adequate tasking and intelligence production and dissemination.²²\nThe push mechanism of the intelligence community can happen in several ways. Often it can follow what constructivists call “norm entrepreneurs.” Entrepreneurs in the cyber domain include Richard Clarke, or John Arquilla and David Ronfeldt, among others.²³ These individuals bring to national policymakers’ attention issues of importance and help direct the intelligence community’s efforts. If, however, they make outlandish claims and statements, their push for new norms can have a backlash and inspire counter-entrepreneurs such as Thomas Rid, who writes that cyber war does not and will not occur.²⁴ Most traditional intelligence push comes from within the intelligence community itself.²⁵ Because the intelligence community is pushing intelligence not requested by the decision-makers, the concept of the intelligence cycle can, as Marrin notes, become linear.²⁶\nBecause the domain is so complex, it is beneficial for the president and policy-makers to have individuals with the requisite understanding of the domain not only in policy and legal terms but also in technical terms. The position currently established is known as the cyber czar. While this position is typically filled by someone with policy or legal expertise, it is beneficial for that individual to have a wide background and a reasonable technical understanding so he or she can facilitate complex discussions. Former cyber czar Melissa Hathaway would be a prime example of the type of individual who could accurately convey the complexity of the technical and historical attributes of interactions in the domain while at the same time have a firm grasp on the policy and legal implications of future actions. This person then sits at the choke point of the\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER SEVEN\npush and pull on the cyber domain and distills the information into a balanced reality applicable for decision-makers.\nFor intelligence to adequately focus its sights on any battlespace, planning and direction from policy-makers must occur. Once policy-makers have established the importance of a battlespace, the intelligence community must find ways to deliver accurate and reliable intelligence. The objective of intelligence collection is not solely to provide real-time information on the battlespace; rather, it is best thought of as battlespace preparation or what Waltz refers to as \"intelligence preparation of the battlespace\" (IPB).[27] Although Waltz specifically refers to IPB in the context of coordinated conventional warfare and the use of information operations in network-centric warfare, the theoretical principles apply across all domains. IPB, according to Waltz, includes providing an understanding of the \"physical, political, electronic, cyber, and other dimensions of the battlespace.\"[28] Alan D. Campen and Douglas H. Dearth reiterate the concept of IPB in Cyberwar 3.0. They state that information warfare requires an accurate knowledge of the battlespace as well as real-time awareness of situations within the battlespace as they arise.\nBefore moving directly into how each collection type can add to a holistic picture of the battlespace, it is necessary to define what constitutes the battlespace in the cyber domain. The battlespace, according to Waltz, constitutes \"all decision-relevant elements within a defined battlespace, and the ability to predict with very high confidence near-term enemy actions and outcomes.\"[29] More specifically this requires an understanding of human, material, and technical capabilities and the relationship of these capabilities within themselves and to other aspects of the operational environment. It is also important to understand the political implications of alterations in capabilities and the environment over time. A battlespace for cyber can be domestic or foreign and is considered to constitute three basic layers: physical, logical, and social layers. Intelligence must inform policy-makers on all three categories.\nThe physical layer is composed of a geographical location and the physical devices that constitute the environment. These devices can include hardware such as computers, switches, and routers. The devices that compose the physical layer can also include computing devices such as mobile phones, cars, airplanes, and ships. The physical layer also includes those devices used to facilitate cyber actions such as transoceanic cables, power stations, and buildings. Knowing the physical attributes of a target is often important when attempting to create cyber-kinetic responses. The physical structure of a network can provide clues as to the purpose of the network or point to vulnerabilities of constituent components of a network.\nBuilt upon the physical layer is a logical layer, which makes many of the aspects of the physical layer function. Firmware and software combine to form\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nThe Role of Intelligence in Cyberspace [111]\na logical layer. Just as there are numerous components to the physical layer there are hundreds if not thousands of different software and firmware applications that combine to make cyberspace function. When targeting a system it is often necessary to have intelligence on the attributes of the system being attacked. A piece of malware designed for a Windows 7 OS zero-day vulnerability will not work if that malware is deployed to a computer running Mac OS X Yosemite.\nLastly, the combination of the physical and the logical layers make the social layer possible. Even if the network and the software layers are air-gapped and highly secure, the social layer, the layer where people interact with the computing device, can still offer up vulnerabilities, as was illustrated in the Stuxnet incident. Knowing who is using a device and how they perceive and interact with the world around them can open up a variety of vulnerabilities including social engineering and phishing. The social layer is composed of both the actual people and personalities using the computing devices and the cyber persona of the individual using a platform.\nAggregating outward, the layers of cyberspace and their attributes in the vernacular of international relations constitute capabilities. Capabilities can be broadly defined as including mechanisms of offensive and defensive military strength such as size and number of offensive cyber units. Capabilities can include doctrinal measures or indicators such as official cyber security and warfare doctrines and can include the size and complexity of systems and their connections to other systems of importance. And capabilities can include technical capabilities such as programming skill within the environment.\nThe capabilities matrix included below is overly simplified, yet it indicates a host of areas where the intelligence community can provide significant assistance to decision-makers. What is important to consider is that these capabilities are not limited to the United States or its allies. Capabilities need to be assessed on a nation-by-nation basis and on a substate basis as well. These and many other unmentioned cyber capabilities combine to provide an accurate picture of the battlespace.\nIdentifying the capabilities and political situation of a new battlespace is difficult under the best of circumstances. Cyber is immensely complicated and therefore necessitates a logical template within which to examine capabilities. There is a need for a differentiation between the domestic (defensive) and the foreign (offensive) battlespace. This distinction is important both for tasking and decision-making. When the two battlespaces are separated, they are able to inform one another. Table 7.2 highlights many of the primary areas for consideration within the two battlespaces necessary for DBA and DBK.\nThe INTs above can and should be focused on these and related areas within the cyber domain. A holistic picture of the above components of the domain will\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER SEVEN\nTABLE 7.2 Components of Cyber DBA and DBK\n|  Domestic (Defense Oriented) | Foreign (Offense Oriented)  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  Policy considerations (offensive & defensive) | Policy considerations (offensive & defensive)  |\n|  Domestic network mapping | Foreign network mapping  |\n|  Budget allocations | Budget allocations  |\n|  ICT collaboration (alliances, partnerships) | Offensive unit size & training  |\n|  Defensive unit size & training | Defensive unit size & training  |\n|  Critical infrastructure | Critical infrastructure  |\n|  Insider threats for defensive purposes | Insider threats for offensive purposes  |\n|  Threat spectrum capabilities | Historical record of attack and defense  |\n|  Known vulnerabilities | Threat spectrum capabilities  |\n|  Time to attack recognition | Known vulnerabilities  |\n|  Time to attack attribution | ICT collaborations (alliances, partnerships)  |\n|  Systemic dependencies | Time to attack recognition  |\n|  Monitoring | Time to attack attribution  |\n|   | Systemic dependencies  |\n|   | Surveillance  |\n|   | Reconnaissance  |\nprovide decision-makers with a clearer visualization of the battlespace. Again, following Waltz, a visualization of any battlespace includes the following:\n\nEdward Amoroso argues the intelligence community should focus on creating an addition to the conventional intelligence briefs that consist solely of information pertaining to cyber.[31] Amoroso indicates such a report should focus on current security posture, top and new security risks, automated metrics, and human interpretation. Amoroso's case for the creation of a cyber-specific intelligence brief is sound and works toward promoting an accurate and realistic understanding of the threats and opportunities within this new and evolving domain relevant to national security.\n# POLICY CONSIDERATIONS\nThe Joint Chiefs of Staff have placed an increasing emphasis on the cyber domain within various joint doctrine publications. Joint doctrines provide insight into the needs of the services and policy-makers in the employment of and defense against cyber attacks. Documents also include many of the ways cyber\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nThe Role of Intelligence in Cyberspace [113]\nhas come to rely heavily on intelligence assets. Information superiority has become a mission critical aspect of defending national security. The Department of Defense's \"Joint Doctrine for Command and Control Warfare\" dating back to 1996 highlights the importance of intelligence products in support of C2W. The document indicates the use of intelligence assists in the conceptualization of all aspects of a battlespace.\nComprehension of any battlespace, including the cyber domain, requires understanding the policy environment in which an action occurs. Is there a national cyber defense strategy within the targeted country? How have they publicly or privately declared they would respond to hostile acts within the cyber domain? An example of the policy environment can be found in the \"Department of Defense Strategy for Operating in Cyberspace.\" The strategy outlines five strategic initiatives in its declassified report:\nStrategic Initiative 1: Treat cyberspace as an operational domain to organize, train, and equip so that DoD can take full advantage of cyberspace's potential\nStrategic Initiative 2: Employ new defense operating concepts to protect DoD networks and systems\nStrategic Initiative 3: Partner with other U.S. government departments and agencies and the private sector to enable a whole-of-government cyber security strategy\nStrategic Initiative 4: Build robust relationships with U.S. allies and international partners to strengthen collective cyber security\nStrategic Initiative 5: Leverage the nation's ingenuity through an exceptional cyber workforce and rapid technological innovation\nThe recently declassified sections of the report cited in the media indicate a doctrinal shift in the way the DoD approaches the cyber domain. The Wall Street Journal reports that DoD sources as early as 2011 indicated that some instances of cyber attacks can constitute an act of war.[32] This has further developed as recently as September 2014 with the NATO pledge for mutual defense in the event of significant cyber attacks that might result in the invocation of Article 5.[33] When asked what constitutes an act of war in cyberspace that would rise to a level that would result in the successful invocation of Article 5 for mutual defense, NATO secretary general Rasmussen said that the goal was to achieve \"strategic ambiguity\" to keep adversaries guessing and to act as \"ambiguous deterrence.\"[34]\nAlthough the current position on what constitutes an act of war in cyberspace within the eyes of the United States and NATO remains uncertain, understanding the policy positions within the domestic battlespace and in the foreign battlespace helps alleviate information asymmetries and establish clearly identifiable patterns for response. Whether it is the knowledge that Germany and the Netherlands both have official cyber security doctrines or that China has begun implementing a policy of making offensive cyber capabilities a strategic priority,\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER SEVEN\nthe overt and covert collection of policy positions provides policy-makers with a foundation for understanding intelligence related to cyber.\nPolicy platforms also help to codify international law, to create zones of norms or an identifiable policy framework in which states will interact or respond to incidents emanating from cyberspace.³⁵ While both the United States and Russia have made known a cyber attack could constitute an act of war, there has been little elaboration on specific characteristics of such an attack within the official policy-making circles of government. Often states will intentionally leave room for policy ambiguity as a mechanism of deterrence.³⁶ Understanding ambiguity, information gaps, and information asymmetry is crucial particularly in comprehending how leaders arrive at decisions. As in conventional warfare, in cyber conflict the minimization of or the knowledge about what a potential adversary will do in a given situation provides a strategic edge. Although there has been little in the form of codified policy delineation on what level of cyber attack would constitute an act of war, the academic community has been heavily engaged in attempting to apply existing legal frameworks to the cyber domain. The most notable work in this arena is the Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare, which works through in rigorous detail how actions within cyberspace could fall within existing international law.³⁷ Yet as rigorous as the work is, there is no single government required to adhere to its findings on the applicability of international law, and even within the laws themselves there was a significant amount of debate as to what constituted various levels of action in cyberspace. Instead of thinking of sponsored academic works such as the Tallinn Manual as clear policies to which states should adhere, they should be instead thought of as roadmaps to guide states in developing policies.\n# CE—NETWORK MAPPING, SYSTEMIC DEPENDENCIES, AND HISTORICAL RECORDS\nUnderstanding the policy environment both domestically and among foreign adversaries is only part of the larger intelligence process. Cyber exploitation (CE) constitutes a series of technological and analytical approaches to cyber-specific espionage. CE for the purposes of conventional intelligence collection can include the penetration of foreign networks to secure information on weapons systems, policy positions, and much more. CE is invasive yet does not disrupt, deny, or destroy data; it collects data. When CE operations focus intelligence on the cyber domain for offensive and defensive purposes, the objective is to understand the systems themselves. The goal becomes identifying the strengths and weaknesses of systems, the connectivity of systems to points of interests, and the interaction of those systems with strategic and tactical objectives.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nThe Role of Intelligence in Cyberspace [115]\nThere are numerous methods of CE; for the purposes of simplicity only a few are examined here. Network mapping is a form of CE that studies the physical connectivity of networks or the availability of insecure ports. This type of mapping provides information on what types of systems and servers operate on different networks and identifies the characteristics of the various component parts these systems constitute. Network mapping can drill down to very low levels on particular networks and provide significant information speed and types of hardware on various networks. This information can also be used to isolate portions of networks to identify potential heavy traffic users or other sources of potential exploitation.\nNetwork mapping is also useful for illustrating the potential for any particular targeted attack to extend beyond its intended target and result in collateral damage or blowback. Conceptually network mapping is not dissimilar from attempting to map radar or surface-to-air missile locations prior to a bombing campaign. The intent of network mapping is to gain an operational knowledge of an adversary's systems prior to engaging in an OCO.\nForensic analysis of the Stuxnet worm found the worm partially employed network mapping to target its attacks, focusing on isolated networks using memory sticks as the initial method of transmission.[38] Once in, Stuxnet focused its attack on networks with programmable logic controllers (PLCs) of a specific type and caused uranium enrichment centrifuges to malfunction.[39] The level of sophistication required to drill down to get to this level of detail to plan an attack is remarkable, particularly considering the complexity and number of overall systems and the air-gapped nature of the systems.\nNetwork mapping is both an offensive and defensive intelligence endeavor. To adequately prepare both the defensive and offensive battlespaces, an accurate picture of systems is needed. Arguably the dual domestic-foreign pictures are complementary and help avoid violating part 2.13 of Executive Order 12333, which prevents any covert action from influencing U.S. political processes, public opinion, policies, media, or various sections of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.[40]\nNetwork mapping and monitoring is a double-edged sword. Legally network mapping can be considered CE, and therefore domestic network mapping by U.S. intelligence agencies without a warrant would be prohibited. However, network mapping is of critical importance to the maintenance of national security infrastructures. Thus far the intelligence community does not have a formal commitment from the White House or the Justice Department to engage in any domestic CE operations.[41] Currently in the United States there is an uneasy and inefficient public-private commitment to providing information on network security across critical infrastructure. A thorough understanding of domestic and foreign networks assists in visualization for both offensive and defensive\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER SEVEN\npurposes, and effort to push reasoned analysis of threats has begun to make its way into Congress.⁴²\nNetwork mapping assists in the identification of network components. Once network components are known, it becomes necessary to explore vulnerabilities within systems. Most damaging are zero-day vulnerabilities, which are vulnerabilities in computer applications of which even system administrators are unaware. The Stuxnet attack exposed several zero-day vulnerabilities in the Windows software controlling/monitoring the programmable logic controllers, causing the attached centrifuges to spin outside of their safe operational standards.\nSystemic vulnerabilities necessitate a thorough understanding of the historical record of different types of attacks and exploits. The identification of zero-day vulnerabilities should lead network administrators to immediately patch these gaps. Intelligence plays a role in identifying what types of attacks have been used in the past and what vulnerabilities these attacks attempted to exploit. Historical accounting is important for both offensive and defensive preparation of the battlespace. For obvious reasons it is important to prevent repeat attacks on domestic systems; at the same time it is important not to engage in repeat attack methods once a vulnerability on an opposing system has been fixed. Such an attack would likely be ineffective and lead to anonymity-attribution problems.\nThe historical accounting of attack types by countries and substate actors also alerts operators within the intelligence and military community to the threat spectrum capabilities of a particular cyber adversary. Understanding the threat spectrum capabilities of states facilitates an accurate conceptualization of their power to operate within the domain. Table 7.3 is a representation of known threat spectrum capabilities.\nThe above areas of consideration within CE are only a small sampling of the overall tasking priorities for intelligence using CE methods. They hint at a broad applicability for CYBERINT methods in the preparation of the battlespace.\n# CONVENTIONAL INTELLIGENCE\nIntelligence collected on budgetary allocations, offensive and defensive cyber unit sizes, and training methodologies provides the clearest parallel to conventional intelligence. As in conventional intelligence, most countries are frequently unwilling to release data on absolute military expenditures or the sizes and force structures within their military. Military capabilities are a closely guarded secret in most countries. Capabilities are particularly secretive in the cyber domain. Often if cyber capabilities are exposed, they cease to be capabilities.⁴³ Once Stuxnet was discovered by the Iranians, defensive measures were taken to \"plug\" the holes the Stuxnet attack employed. This dramatically reduces\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nTABLE 7.3 Cyber Threat Spectrum\n|  Levels (Types) of Attack | Description | Feasibility | Complexity  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  Propaganda | The propagation of information via the Internet to affect public, private, or governmental opinion.

Whereas missiles can be launched with repeated success because the ability to defend against a moving projectile is difficult, a similar cyber weapon is more easily defended against once it has been identified. Antivirus software can be reprogrammed to identify and isolate repeat threats, and zero-day vulnerabilities can be patched.\nAn excellent example of an open source analysis of cyber capabilities comes from Stokes, Lin, and Hsiao, who examine in explicit detail the construction, location, leadership, and mission of many aspects of the Chinese People's Liberation Army information warfare programs.⁴⁴ Their report is an example of a high-value detailed analysis that could be supplemented by conventional intelligence to enhance policy-maker and combatant commander comprehension of the battlespace. The detailed analysis of the location and force structure can cause an enemy to shift its tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and make them less reliable. Alternatively, not revealing that information has been gained on TTPs can provide an offensive edge in cyber operations.\nThe implications for conventional intelligence collection methods indicate that intelligence on cyber does not necessarily need to remain cyberbound or exclusively within the realm of CE. Many metrics such as force size matter in cyber and can be examined to create a better assessment of potential adversaries. Cyber force size is particularly important from a malware development perspective. Complex coding scripts typically necessitate large numbers of programmers to develop and test the scripts. The ability for an individual to accomplish highly complex attacks is possible but less likely than a large cyber warfare unit working with the same objective.\nLikewise, knowing where a unit is located or how programmers were trained can help planners determine the best response to a particular attack, or how best to manipulate their organizational structure. Derek Clark and Kai Konrad refer to this as identifying the weakest link.⁴⁵ The identification of the weakest link is particularly important in cyber defense and offense. There are multiple fronts (systems) needing defense. All it takes is one \"best shot\" to achieve significant damage. While this weakest link can be identified through CE operations outlined in the previous section, it can also be identified within the training, command, and organizational structure of units charged with conducting or protecting against cyber attacks.\nClosely related to the conventional military metrics above, yet likely unique to the cyber domain, are public-private ICT collaborations. Although most countries have programs for military public and private collaborations with universities and businesses for research and development, within the cyber domain the importance of this relationship is magnified for multiple reasons. First, much of the training and education necessary to conduct offensive or defensive oper\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nThe Role of Intelligence in Cyberspace [119]\nations within cyberspace can be learned at public institutions or can be crafted for private sector use. This extends far beyond the development of technology to the actual training of the warfighter, the development of the platforms upon which the domain rests, and more. Second, these collaborations spread out but do not diffuse potential vulnerabilities.\nBecause collaborations can form the foundational aspects of the cyber warriors within offensive and defensive units, they can train, equip, and prepare in ways far different from conventional military means. Most countries have a balance between civilian and military protection of their national cyber infrastructures based largely on the development of computer emergency response teams (CERTs). An intelligence assessment of the strength and quality of ICT collaborations is of critical importance in understanding the cyber battlespace.\nICT collaborations are not necessarily official and do not need to be highly structured and regimented. Alexander Klimburg provides evidence Russia and China have created groups of plausibly deniable cyber attackers.[46] Creating an accurate open source measure of unofficial collaborations is difficult. An intelligence focus on unofficial collaborations with entities can contextualize cyber incidents such as the 2007 cyber attacks directed at Estonian governmental, bank, and communications websites.[47] The attacks were motivated by a decision to move a Russian war memorial from central Tallinn. While initial reports indicated Russia was the culprit, Russia denied any participation in the cyber attacks.[48] The reality is somewhat murkier and more akin to an unofficial sanction or condoning of cyber attacks by the Russian government.[49]\nThe collection and production of intelligence on more conventional attributes of pertinence to the cyber domain is a role in which the intelligence community is likely already engaged. Occasionally reports on issues relating to this category of intelligence are published for public consumption. A recent report of this type was produced for the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission to examine China's capability to conduct cyber warfare and cyber exploitation.[50] Knowledge of capabilities is still applicable to the cyber domain and is greatly influenced by conventional intelligence collection methods and subsequent analysis, which contextualizes the meaning of raw intelligence.\n## HUMINT AND CYBER\nHuman intelligence (HUMINT) stands out in cyber for two particular reasons. First, HUMINT agents can provide accurate internal information on systems and access to those systems unavailable through CE and other intelligence collection methods. Second, human assets can serve as a bridge between the external world and air-gapped or other forms of secure networks. As was indicated above, it is likely that the Stuxnet virus was distributed using a thumb drive,\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER SEVEN\nwhich needed to be inserted into a machine within an air-gapped network. HUMINT agents can serve as a vulnerability against which most network administrators will be unable to provide significant protection.\nThe role of a HUMINT asset with access to information on networks can be extremely damaging. Even if the agent is on a lightly classified network, the repercussions of his or her actions can be enormous. The scandal caused by Bradley Manning (now named Chelsea Manning) leaking more than 260,000 diplomatic cables to WikiLeaks in 2010 is illustrative of the problem posed by internal threats.⁵¹ Manning’s leak and the even more damaging 2013 document releases by Edward Snowden, a former employee of a contractor affiliated with both the NSA and CIA, highlight the potential damage a rogue employee can have on the ability of the intelligence community to keep information secret.⁵² Snowden’s insider collection and subsequent release of documents pertaining to the National Security Agency likely constitutes one of the most significant intelligence leaks of all time and resulted in an estimated 1.7 million documents being released in violation of U.S. classification law.⁵³ Moreover, unlike the leaks by Manning, the Snowden leaks revealed many of the TTPs used by the NSA in its intelligence operations in the cyber domain. These revelations have been extremely damaging and have resulted in changes in the way adversaries safeguard their cyber infrastructure.\nHUMINT threats need to be developed and enhanced for offensive intelligence and protected against for domestic national security counterintelligence. Gaining access to the technical schematics, documents, information, login procedures, or any of a multitude of other targets of intelligence a HUMINT asset could provide is a critical aspect added directly by intelligence to the understanding of the cyber domain. Furthermore, HUMINT agents are almost impossible to detect under normal circumstances as they can often engage in significant espionage while still easily performing the normal duties. Unlike the spy thriller days of old when agents had to sneak out of a building with classified documents in a folder or a box, they can often place thousands or millions of documents on a solid-state drive and easily conceal it upon exiting a facility. Many of these drives are smaller in size than a penny.\nBeyond the collection of intelligence from HUMINT sources, these insiders can assist in the implementation of cyber actions. Information within a 2005 report by the U.S. Secret Service in cooperation with Carnegie Mellon indicated that up to 29 percent of all attacks against a surveyed group of critical infrastructure stakeholders were initiated by insiders.⁵⁴ The majority of motivations behind these attacks were not related to intelligence or covert action. This, however, does not preclude the possibility of using insiders to affect or gain information or access on adversary systems. The recruitment and maintenance of insider threats by the intelligence community should be a top priority. These\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nThe Role of Intelligence in Cyberspace\nFIGURE 7.1 Timeline for Attack Implementation\nagents can offer a mission a critical component, often during times when more lengthy intelligence collection processes are constrained by events.\n# TIME FOR ATTACK RECOGNITION, COMPLETION, AND ATTRIBUTION\nAttack recognition and attribution are also critical for both a defensive and offensive battlespace planning. All of the intelligence collection methods and the focus of the intel process of trying to comprehend the cyber domain culminate in understanding, from a mission critical orientation, the progression of cyber attacks. Figure 7.1 is a simplified model for understanding attack planning and progression within a battlespace modeled loosely on the JP 3-51 electronic warfare-planning model.[55] This model is informed by intelligence collection. Line one of the figure indicates a policy-maker's perspective on the process of engaging in conflict. A conflict initiation is (o) planned, (1) implemented, and (2) completed. Policy-makers want to know what resources any given action will take and how long it will take to complete it. In cyber a more accurate timeline for action in cyberspace requires (o) intelligence collection, (1) operational planning of the attack with an informed knowledge of the battlespace, (2) understanding of the time it takes for the attack to be completed, (3) how long until the attack is recognized as an attack by the adversary, (4) how long until that adversary can do something about the attack, (5) how long until the adversary assigns attribution for the attack. The ordering of the items listed above greatly affects the ability for an attack to be conducted successfully. Intelligence informs the policy-maker and commander as to the feasibility of a particular type of attack and the probability of success. If recognition of an attack occurs early in the timeline of events the probability of success is diminished.\nThe timeline can be tested in much the same way conventional weapons are tested. It would be absurd to send a bomber over a potential target with a completely untested bomb, or to send a soldier into battle with an untested model of rifle. Just as weapons are tested in the physical world, they need to be tested in the cyber domain as well. This testing provides added information to both\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER SEVEN\nFIGURE 7.2 The Influence of Intelligence on Cyber Operations\nModified from E. Waltz, Information Warfare.\nthe policy-maker and the combatant commander as to the effectiveness of the weapon and the timeline of events above. If a cyber weapon is slow and easily detectable, its probability for success is diminished. This lowered probability for success does not nullify its use but does condition it.\nOne aspect of this phase of IPB is that it is extremely beneficial to both the offensive and defensive strategic and tactical operations. By planning and testing potential attacks against theoretical adversarial systems, the intelligence community provides an out-of-the-box perspective necessary to prevent similar attacks against domestic targets. This logic would indicate an attempt to use a worm like Stuxnet against the U.S. infrastructure would run into greater problems than if the weapon had been developed first elsewhere.\n# IPB AND ITS IMPACT ON CYBER\nThe role of intelligence in cyber is not dissimilar from its role in the conventional domains. There are new areas in which collection and analysis need to occur, yet its overall objective remains the same. Returning to Edward Waltz's concept of information preparation of the battlefield, figure 7.2 illustrates intelligence's influence on operations originating within the cyber domain. The role of intelligence in cyber is to accurately facilitate an understanding of those\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nThe Role of Intelligence in Cyberspace [123]\nentities and the possible tools by which to influence them. The cyber domain is surrounded with hype and hysteria. Many of the claims are accurately based in reality. But the known unknowns are still enormous within this evolving domain, and it is incumbent on intelligence to provide an accurate assessment of the current state of affairs.\nAll-source intelligence for cyber operations requires the intelligence community to think beyond domestic system defense. The focus should be balanced between foreign and domestic intelligence, thereby mutually informing one another and creating a systemic defense for national assets in addition to better facilitating decision-makers with a more accurate picture of how a potential cyber attack might succeed or fail.\n# CYBER AS COVERT ACTION\nTo further define the role of intelligence in cyber, it is necessary to look more deeply into the laws codifying the conduct of the intelligence community. All of the above sections provide a framework for defining the role of intelligence with regard to IPB. Cyber conflict is, by its very nature, covert. Even if an attack is discovered, it is often unattributable. Attacks can be designed to go unnoticed and affect changes to systems and their components for days, weeks, or months without detection. Even in instances where groups such as Anonymous publically take credit for attacks, responsibility is typically claimed post hoc. Nearly all examples of state-on-state cyber attacks have been covert.\nThe covert nature of cyber brings full circle Warner's definition of intelligence as attempting to influence. Covert action is a secret operation to influence a foreign entity. At least in theory, most, if not all, cyber attacks begin covertly. Section 1.7(a)(4) of Executive Order 12333 regarding intelligence activities describes covert action:\nConduct convert action activities approved by the President. No agency except the Central Intelligence Agency (or the Armed Forces of the United States in time of war declared by the Congress or during any period covered by a report from the President to the Congress consistent with the War Powers Resolution, Public Law 93-148) may conduct any covert action activity unless the President determines that another agency is more likely to achieve a particular objective.[56]\nEvident in the early structuring of the governmental approach to cyberspace is the categorization of cyber operations as covert actions. The Department of Defense originally took the lead with General Keith Alexander as the head of both NSA and Cyber Command, a path that has continued now that Admiral Michael Rogers has taken over as the head of both organizations. This indicates the president has established an agency other than the Central Intelligence\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER SEVEN\nAgency as the primary covert operator within this domain. While the logic behind having a military intelligence organization commander and an organizational structure that falls under the U.S. Strategic Command (STRATCOM) runs counter to EO 12333, the institutional capacity of the DoD in the technical domain and the scale of the problem being faced within this new domain make the assignment appropriate.\n# SUMMARIZING THE ROLE OF INTELLIGENCE WITHIN THE CYBER DOMAIN\nIn defining the role of intelligence within the cyber domain, it is necessary to take a holistic approach. From a collection perspective, the intelligence community should be and has been working in coordination with a hybrid push-and-pull intelligence cycle to both elevate the importance of this domain and facilitate collection within it. The emphasis has been heavily defensive up to this point and largely focused on countering threats rather than anticipating them. This needs to change, and the only way this can change is if the intelligence community begins to actively turn its sights on adversaries and develop more rigorous all-source intelligence combining novel CYBERINT technologies to augment reporting on this domain. Parroting Amoroso's assertion, cyber should be included on the daily intelligence briefs of policy-makers. The inclusion would likely start the process of demystification of this immensely complicated domain.\nCyberspace is a domain that can be used to fulfill all aspects of Warner's definition of intelligence to some degree. It is a domain in which it is possible to gain understanding about other states beyond and within the domain itself, but it is also a domain that can influence other states' policy decisions as well as perceptions. In particular, accurate intelligence on both sides of the domestic-foreign divide can mutually inform decision-makers about vulnerabilities and the eventual decision to use cyber as an offensive weapon or how best to defend against attacks. Moreover, intelligence can rein in the debate on cyber to a more realistic area of operations predicated on sound estimates rather than on grandiose speculation.\nThe intelligence community itself commonly is the point of origin for OCOs emanating from the cyber domain and will likely serve as a force multiplier in instances where a combined conventional cyber attack is necessary. To engage in cyber conflict, just as in conventional conflict, intelligence is needed to prepare the battlespace and facilitate an accurate assessment of the probability for success and utility for any type of operation. This preparation hones the weapons, decisions, and effect of a potential operation. More importantly for national security, a thorough and accurate preparation of both the foreign and domestic battlespaces will serve to inform and enhance cyber security.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms",

    "# Defining the Role of Intelligence in Cyberspace": "If ignorant both of your enemy and yourself, you are certain to be in peril.\nSun Tzu\nINFORMATION IS THE LIFEBLOOD of modern states. Intelligence is increasingly facilitating information superiority through an understanding of the cyber domain. The Department of Defense's \"Joint Vision 2020\" establishes the goal of information superiority on the battlefield. This information superiority enables decision superiority and favorably tilts the strategic and tactical balance. Information superiority is built on cyber power, scale and complexity of attacks, robustness of defense, policy positions, systemic vulnerabilities and dependencies, and actor anonymity and attribution issues. Intelligence plays a mission critical role in assessing these characteristics. The discussion below examines the role of intelligence in identifying these characteristics within the cyber domain and examines how it influences the decision-making of policy-makers. Specifically the focus hones in on how intelligence increases the effectiveness of identifying potential attackers within the cyber domain and informs the decision-making of policy-makers when engaging in covert cyber action directed against a potential adversary. The discussion is designed to serve as a strategic framework in which to understand the role of intelligence within the cyber domain.\nIs it really necessary to examine the role of intelligence within the cyber domain as contextually different than in a conventional domain? The short answer is yes. Cyber necessitates independent examination because it is characteristically different, and yet at the same time it is a pervasive feature affecting outcomes within other domains. What differentiates cyber from land, sea, air, and space are three fundamental attributes relevant to intelligence practitioners. First, the cyber domain is a man-made domain. Second, military capabilities across the other domains are managed through the cyber domain. Third, military and civilian aspects of the cyber domain are often intertwined and difficult to differentiate. These attributes pose unique opportunities and problems for intelligence officials.\nThe man-made nature of the cyber domain makes it a largely virtual domain with its value corresponding to the speed and volume of information contained\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER SEVEN\nwithin it. However, the cyber domain is not entirely virtual and has numerous real-world connection points to everything from industrial control systems of power and water management facilities to the weapon systems of drones flying above distant battlefields.\nCyberspace is not tangible in the same way as more conventional domains and therefore necessitates a new form of dynamic intelligence evolving from all-source collection of conventional and novel intelligence sources. A recent National Research Council report states that intelligence in the cyber domain is useful for both strategic and tactical purposes.¹ The strategic and tactical importance of intelligence's role in influencing the cyber domain falls within the concept of all-source intelligence. Loch Johnson defines all-source intelligence as one of the fundamental propositions of a theory of strategic intelligence.² More importantly for the purposes of understanding the operational and political environments within which offensive and defensive actions in cyberspace can occur, it is necessary to understand what intelligence is within decisions regarding the cyber domain and how intelligence influences those decisions.\n## DEFINING INTELLIGENCE\nThere are dozens of different definitions of intelligence, each of which is in some way applicable to understanding cyber action. One of the more succinct and conceptually ordered comes from Michael Warner, who defines intelligence as a \"secret, state activity to understand or influence foreign entities.\"³ His definition establishes the fundamental premises of both collection and analysis, while including actions designed to influence. Intelligence is vital to the cyber domain because foreign entities are increasingly storing, managing, and directing their governmental, public, private, and military functions in a digitized world.\nThe traditional intelligence collection types (INTs) are still of immense value, yet they must be combined with aspects of the digitized target spectrum to provide a holistic view of both threats and opportunities. At present the majority of studies in the public domain have focused on defense.⁴ This defensive posture is made clear by General Keith Alexander, the director of the National Security Agency and commander of United States Cyber Command, when he writes: \"US Cyber Command's efforts and planning aim to ensure that the DoD has done all it can to defend and deter determined adversaries, mitigate dangerous threats, and address nagging vulnerabilities, so that even our most capable opponents will know that interfering with our nation's equities in cyberspace is a losing proposition.\"⁵\nThis defensive and deterrent-reliant posture is limiting and prone to inadequacies. Echoing Machiavelli and to some extent Sun Tzu, the adage \"the best defense is a good offense\" offers a novel way of considering action and intelli\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nThe Role of Intelligence in Cyberspace\ngence within cyber. More accurately, it allows for a systematic approach to both national cyber defensive and offensive resource allocations. Beyond the efficiency argument for shifting the focus from solely defense to a balance between defense and offense, intelligence collection can help to inform offensive strategies and the decision to use cyber as a weapon. The role of intelligence within cyber becomes increasingly important when considering the difficulty of achieving any significant measure of deterrence within the cyber domain.⁶\nThe defensive orientation of the majority of cyber literature has a constraining effect on decision-making processes for the use of offensive cyber weapons. This defensive focus is largely due to both the alarmist calls of some scholars and policy-makers and an information communications technologies industry orientation offering many more strategies for defense than for offense. While I do not dispute the need for defense, this defensive focus leads the national security establishment down a path of attempting to create an impenetrable system. If there is one thing that is abundantly clear in the cyber domain it is that the only impenetrable system is the one that has not been made. Cyber is based on physics and algorithms. The mathematics and science behind security measures can be immensely complex and take massive computing power to penetrate, but that does not make them impenetrable. Even the most robust systems secured with checks and encryptions are still highly vulnerable to their users' ignorance or malice, as was the case with Edward Snowden in 2013.\nInstead of focusing on a solely carte blanche defensive posture toward cyber security, intelligence can provide both an offensive and defensive picture more effective at safeguarding national security. Taking a step back from the conventional cyber security literature, intelligence can direct cyber security efforts to not merely safeguard national security but also provide an offensive tool for use against other states. The vast literature on intelligence, ranging from the way intelligence influences the policy-making process to how it helps to understand aspects of the development of utility for actions, serves as a guide in defining the role of intelligence within the cyber domain.\nReflecting on Warner's definition of intelligence, the spectrum of intelligence collection methods—from human intelligence (HUMINT) to the more technical collection methods of signals intelligence (SIGINT), measurement and signatures intelligence (MASINT), geospatial intelligence (GEOINT), and open source intelligence (OSINT)—works together in an all-source environment to provide an accurate understanding of foreign entities. (Table 7.1 provides a quick definitional reference for the various intelligence collection types.) The understanding provided by intelligence has largely focused on the conventional domains and on political decision-making. However, as decisions in conventional domains increasingly migrate toward cyberspace, and the systems controlling the tools used in these domains increasingly become digitally connected, the\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER SEVEN\nTABLE 7.1 Intelligence Collection Methods\n|  Intelligence Source Type | Definition  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  Open Source (OSINT) | Overtly available information found, selected, and acquired from publicly available source.  |\n|  Measurement and Signatures (MASINT) | Intelligence detected and classified from targets that identify or describe signatures (distinctive characteristics) of fixed or dynamic target sources.  |\n|  Human (HUMINT) | Intelligence collected through interpersonal contact via human collection officers.  |\n|  Geospatial (GEOINT)* | The exploitation and analysis of imagery and geospatial information to describe, assess, and visually depict physical features and geographically referenced activities on the earth.

Williams, Shimeal, and Dunlevy, \"Intelligence Analysis for Internet Security.\" CYBERINT is considered independent of traditional SIGINT. However, as in many of the other types of intelligence collection, techniques and agencies often overlap.\nimportance of understanding the technical schematics and decision processes becomes vital to national security.\nNick Cullather, in an article on digital connections on the battlefield, indicates significant advances in the development of network-centric warfare. Cullather notes that the rise of a \"revolution in military affairs\" has largely not been matched by the intelligence community's ability to keep up. This is of particular importance when looking beyond the network-centric battlefield of conventional weapons to the new zone of confrontation within cyberspace itself. Similarly, Michael Herman finds that counterterrorism intelligence analysis requires a broad spectrum of information sources brought together. ICT facilitates the mitigation of \"stovepipes\" and increases the efficiency in information transference. Information transmission has also been facilitated following the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 by the creation of \"fusion centers.\" ICT has a role to play not only in the conduct of war on the battlefield, but also in the management of a conventional traditional threat spectrum within the fusion centers and beyond in the wider intelligence community.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nThe Role of Intelligence in Cyberspace\nTerrorism is not commonly regarded as part of the conventional threat spectrum, yet in reality most terrorist acts take place in the physical world and require bombs and guns. However, the information coordination necessary to organize, plan, and conduct warfare, terrorist acts, and political strategies has largely shifted to cyberspace. The 2008 Mumbai terrorist attacks are a poignant example of terrorists leveraging technology and open source intelligence collected from public sites and software such as Google Earth to plan and orchestrate mass murder. As horrific as the use of digital tools for planning attacks is, it is not isolated to open source intelligence collection via tools. Terrorists also use open source cryptography and crypto-currencies to finance their operations. Intelligence agencies are in a competition with other states and organizations to leverage tools effectively to prevent attacks by terrorists and to mitigate international incidents before they arise.\nWhile open source research is fundamentally more powerful than ever before, available open source information provides only a limited aperture to realistically size up threats and targets within cyberspace itself. The problem of intelligence in cyberspace is massive both in terms of scale and complexity of data. Joel Brenner, a former inspector general of the National Security Agency and head of U.S. counterintelligence, indicated there has been an enormous threat emanating from within cyberspace that is not being adequately addressed.\nModern warfare, command and control warfare (C2W), is network centric. Large swaths of the national critical infrastructures in states that pose conventional security and economic threats to the United States are controlled by digital systems. The literature is less focused on the need for understanding these vulnerabilities than it is on safeguarding them. The defensive focus, to a large degree, overshadows the development of offensive capabilities.\nPhil Williams, Timothy Shimeal, and Casey Dunlevy make a well-reasoned case arguing for focused intelligence efforts on identifying threats to national cyber security. These authors make a valid point that needs to be addressed and is being addressed by several national strategy documents on the topic, including the National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace and the \"International Strategy for Cyberspace.\" One report of particular importance addressing many of the issues brought up by Williams, Shimeal, and Dunlevy is the October 2011 report by the Office of the National Counterintelligence Executive on cyber espionage. A broad spectrum of federal strategies and reports has made identification and protection against vulnerabilities a top priority. More recently the president of the United States under Executive Order 13636 in February 2013 directed the government to begin actively seeking out and planning strategies to mitigate cyber threats to national critical infrastructure.\nThis is a process that is under way and includes an alphabet soup of agencies from across the civilian and military spectrum of the government. A re\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER SEVEN\ncurrent problem that keeps cropping up in many of the discussions on critical infrastructure is network awareness. Many companies and firms affiliated with critical infrastructure do not have an adequate understanding of their own vulnerabilities, let alone how they interact to create systemic threats. One industry based on personal communications and working experience that seems to be working very hard to address these issues is the U.S. financial sector, which in many ways is pioneering cyber security efforts under E.O. 13636.\nCurrently most cyber security is based on attacks or incidents in progress or that have already occurred. It is difficult, if not impossible, to defend against an unknown attack. Much of the effort in the United States cyber community now seems to be equivalent to plugging the holes in the dike after it floods. It is a fact that most cyber attacks are repeat attacks originating at the lower end of the threat spectrum, making the strategy of filling holes in the dike an absolute necessity in an effort to prevent repeat intrusions from identical or similar malware types. Yet this post hoc strategy largely fails to address the more serious problem of accurately anticipating what the next type of attack is going to be. This strategy, best referred to as a \"Maginot Line\" strategy, is prone to failure in areas where technological and strategic capabilities rapidly evolve. The real challenge is to develop intelligence-based approaches to cyberspace that prevent future attacks before they happen.\nThere is a significant and sustained effort underway on the defensive side of the cyber debate within the DoD to develop better security. The DoD is currently employing at least three categories of defensive teams to facilitate DoD network protection: DoD information network operations teams (DoDIN Ops), defensive cyber operations—internal defensive measures teams (DCO-IDM or cyber protection teams), and defensive cyber operations—response action teams (DCO-RA or national mission teams). Yet all of these teams are heavily reliant on intelligence on the cyber environment for defense (ICE-D). The teams that fit into these categories are tasked with segments of the overall problem. While the DoDIN-Ops teams are tasked with ensuring sustained secure operations on DoD networks, they are not focused on adversary behaviors in those networks. Their work is informed by adversary behaviors but seeks to maintain network security in aggregate. DCO-IDM or cyber protection teams function as hunter killers within the network. They are tasked with seeking out individuals engaging DoD networks illegally and stopping the attacks or exploits. DCO-RA or national mission teams are tasked with responding to adversary behavior in DoD networks. As should be readily apparent, the problem is enormous and relies on intelligence for all aspects of ICE-D functions. The DoD network environment alone is composed of millions of computing devices and users.\nBecause we exist in a world of known unknowns and unknown unknowns, to paraphrase Secretary Rumsfeld, cyber security is likely the former rather than\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nThe Role of Intelligence in Cyberspace\nthe latter.¹⁷ How can intelligence be used to improve the cyber security situation not only to protect the national infrastructure in a more systematic and logical manner but also to use this information to inform the decision-making processes of policy-makers?\nOne problem associated with the U.S. cyber community is proximity. Because the community develops, tests, and employs its own tools, it is unable to take into account methods of testing that have not yet threatened systems in the past. This is an in-the-box, out-of-the-box, forget-the-box problem. The designers of systems, software, and networks are talented and smart individuals; they lead the world in technical innovation, yet because they are inside their own systems, it becomes it intrinsically difficult to isolate unforeseen problems. United States Cyber Command and various other teams from the services and the various academies have tried to address this problem by creating competitive cyber teams that compete with one other and against civilian competitors in various challenges such as DefCon capture the flag contests and others. These various DCO and DoDIN-Ops teams also engage one another to consistently foster novel thinking on security.\nYet the challenge is immense, and solutions are best achieved by constant introspection. Below are several proposed strategies to help facilitate the development of improved defensive operations. First, the current orientation toward plugging holes must continue. While this post hoc process is frustrating, it prevents or at least slows further intrusions. The mentality of these DoDIN-Ops is one of defense. The objective is to secure and defend systems against all possible or known types of attacks. The most realistic approach is to defend against known types of attacks. The systems become fortified against repeat incidents or at least can minimize their severity. The work of these teams is not sexy; it is not offense oriented; it is a process of continuous network security development. Second, DCO-IDM teams must also actively hunt in government and defense networks for potential adversaries and leverage information gained through all source intelligence collection and communication with DoDIN-Ops, DCO-RA, and OCO teams to anticipate potential blind spots. These teams must also be regularly rotated to provide them time to think like attackers. Third, DCO-RA teams must leverage all-source intelligence and continuous communications with DCO-IDM and OCO teams to engage adversaries in a defensive posture on foreign networks before they endanger DoD networks. While these teams are in the process of getting organized and established, it is important that these teams have clear interteam communications to mitigate stovepiping. The co-location or consistent rotation of team members would likely facilitate enhanced operational results. The co-location and coordination of members within a team should be of paramount importance as it allows analysts and technicians the opportunity to collaborate and developed a detailed and synergistic understanding of capabilities.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER SEVEN\nThe wider intelligence community must use all-source methods to collect as much intelligence on potential opponents as possible. This means profiling every aspect of other nations' cyber offensive and defensive capabilities. This requires a robust all-source collection methodology. Signals intelligence must look for transmissions and communications as well as spikes in Internet traffic and geo-locate them using IP addresses. These geo-located IP addresses need to be analyzed using satellites and drones to provide accurate geospatial information on the areas in question. Open source intelligence collection should attempt to gain as much publicly available information as possible on areas of interest through legal means. Once all of this information has been compiled and assessed, targeted HUMINT operations should begin working on developing assets within these areas or with connections to these areas. These agents should be recruited for multiple purposes. First, they should be used to secure intelligence on the capabilities of potential adversaries. These capabilities are defined in more detail below. Second, agents should also be recruited to become potential insider threats, a tool of particular importance on air-gapped systems. Third, intelligence agencies should also place an emphasis on cyber exploitation (CE) and attempt to probe and map out network infrastructures, vulnerabilities, and strengths of adversaries. The last point is of importance both from an offensive and defensive strategic orientation.\nAnother major problem with the cyber domain arises out of its systemic complexity. As Williams, Shimeal, and Dunlevy accurately note, cyber defenders often do not have a realistic or accurate picture of their own systems, let alone the systems of adversaries who are attacking them. Following their recommendations, the national security community would be prudent to make use of the principle of knowing yourself. This requires a consistent focus on domestic systems. However, only focusing on domestic systems leads to the \"Maginot Line\" tendency in which it is assumed networks are created to be impenetrable.",
    "# INTELLIGENCE AND THE CYBER BATTLESPACE": "The cyber domain is a modern battlespace and necessitates a holistic understanding. To defend against or engage in offensive actions, it is necessary to have an accurate understanding of the operational environment. According to Edward Waltz, any battlespace, whether offensive or defensive, requires a combination of dominant battlespace awareness (DBA) and dominant battlespace knowledge (DBK). The process of identifying what is and is not important to understanding a particular battlespace largely falls to the discretion of policy-makers within the intelligence cycle.\nIn writing about intelligence and decision-making, Stephen Marrin states: \"the intelligence cycle starts with decision-maker information requirements lev\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nThe Role of Intelligence in Cyberspace\nied on intelligence collection capabilities, the processing of collected raw intelligence and transmission of this processed material to analysts who decipher its meaning, and relay that understanding back to the decision-makers.”²¹\nThe decision-maker engages in tasking through a number of different “pull” mechanisms including governmental reports, hearings before Congress, presidential directives, and executive orders. These tasking methods and others combine to facilitate within the intelligence community an accurate understanding of what constitutes the battlespace in the eyes of the policy-maker. Often the planning and direction can be informal requests from the executive or from Congress, and at other times it can come from official strategy documents.\nPrior to 9/11, terrorism was a priority, but the planning and direction of resources had not yet reached a critical mass sufficient to prevent the terrible attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Marrin and others find the intelligence process frequently fails to adequately define what constitutes a tasking priority for the intelligence community, necessitating a “push” from within the community outward. There are many instances in which policy-makers ignore, misinterpret, or misuse intelligence despite adequate tasking and intelligence production and dissemination.²²\nThe push mechanism of the intelligence community can happen in several ways. Often it can follow what constructivists call “norm entrepreneurs.” Entrepreneurs in the cyber domain include Richard Clarke, or John Arquilla and David Ronfeldt, among others.²³ These individuals bring to national policymakers’ attention issues of importance and help direct the intelligence community’s efforts. If, however, they make outlandish claims and statements, their push for new norms can have a backlash and inspire counter-entrepreneurs such as Thomas Rid, who writes that cyber war does not and will not occur.²⁴ Most traditional intelligence push comes from within the intelligence community itself.²⁵ Because the intelligence community is pushing intelligence not requested by the decision-makers, the concept of the intelligence cycle can, as Marrin notes, become linear.²⁶\nBecause the domain is so complex, it is beneficial for the president and policy-makers to have individuals with the requisite understanding of the domain not only in policy and legal terms but also in technical terms. The position currently established is known as the cyber czar. While this position is typically filled by someone with policy or legal expertise, it is beneficial for that individual to have a wide background and a reasonable technical understanding so he or she can facilitate complex discussions. Former cyber czar Melissa Hathaway would be a prime example of the type of individual who could accurately convey the complexity of the technical and historical attributes of interactions in the domain while at the same time have a firm grasp on the policy and legal implications of future actions. This person then sits at the choke point of the\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER SEVEN\npush and pull on the cyber domain and distills the information into a balanced reality applicable for decision-makers.\nFor intelligence to adequately focus its sights on any battlespace, planning and direction from policy-makers must occur. Once policy-makers have established the importance of a battlespace, the intelligence community must find ways to deliver accurate and reliable intelligence. The objective of intelligence collection is not solely to provide real-time information on the battlespace; rather, it is best thought of as battlespace preparation or what Waltz refers to as \"intelligence preparation of the battlespace\" (IPB). Although Waltz specifically refers to IPB in the context of coordinated conventional warfare and the use of information operations in network-centric warfare, the theoretical principles apply across all domains. IPB, according to Waltz, includes providing an understanding of the \"physical, political, electronic, cyber, and other dimensions of the battlespace.\" Alan D. Campen and Douglas H. Dearth reiterate the concept of IPB in Cyberwar 3.0. They state that information warfare requires an accurate knowledge of the battlespace as well as real-time awareness of situations within the battlespace as they arise.\nBefore moving directly into how each collection type can add to a holistic picture of the battlespace, it is necessary to define what constitutes the battlespace in the cyber domain. The battlespace, according to Waltz, constitutes \"all decision-relevant elements within a defined battlespace, and the ability to predict with very high confidence near-term enemy actions and outcomes.\" More specifically this requires an understanding of human, material, and technical capabilities and the relationship of these capabilities within themselves and to other aspects of the operational environment. It is also important to understand the political implications of alterations in capabilities and the environment over time. A battlespace for cyber can be domestic or foreign and is considered to constitute three basic layers: physical, logical, and social layers. Intelligence must inform policy-makers on all three categories.\nThe physical layer is composed of a geographical location and the physical devices that constitute the environment. These devices can include hardware such as computers, switches, and routers. The devices that compose the physical layer can also include computing devices such as mobile phones, cars, airplanes, and ships. The physical layer also includes those devices used to facilitate cyber actions such as transoceanic cables, power stations, and buildings. Knowing the physical attributes of a target is often important when attempting to create cyber-kinetic responses. The physical structure of a network can provide clues as to the purpose of the network or point to vulnerabilities of constituent components of a network.\nBuilt upon the physical layer is a logical layer, which makes many of the aspects of the physical layer function. Firmware and software combine to form\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nThe Role of Intelligence in Cyberspace\na logical layer. Just as there are numerous components to the physical layer there are hundreds if not thousands of different software and firmware applications that combine to make cyberspace function. When targeting a system it is often necessary to have intelligence on the attributes of the system being attacked. A piece of malware designed for a Windows 7 OS zero-day vulnerability will not work if that malware is deployed to a computer running Mac OS X Yosemite.\nLastly, the combination of the physical and the logical layers make the social layer possible. Even if the network and the software layers are air-gapped and highly secure, the social layer, the layer where people interact with the computing device, can still offer up vulnerabilities, as was illustrated in the Stuxnet incident. Knowing who is using a device and how they perceive and interact with the world around them can open up a variety of vulnerabilities including social engineering and phishing. The social layer is composed of both the actual people and personalities using the computing devices and the cyber persona of the individual using a platform.\nAggregating outward, the layers of cyberspace and their attributes in the vernacular of international relations constitute capabilities. Capabilities can be broadly defined as including mechanisms of offensive and defensive military strength such as size and number of offensive cyber units. Capabilities can include doctrinal measures or indicators such as official cyber security and warfare doctrines and can include the size and complexity of systems and their connections to other systems of importance. And capabilities can include technical capabilities such as programming skill within the environment.\nThe capabilities matrix included below is overly simplified, yet it indicates a host of areas where the intelligence community can provide significant assistance to decision-makers. What is important to consider is that these capabilities are not limited to the United States or its allies. Capabilities need to be assessed on a nation-by-nation basis and on a substate basis as well. These and many other unmentioned cyber capabilities combine to provide an accurate picture of the battlespace.\nIdentifying the capabilities and political situation of a new battlespace is difficult under the best of circumstances. Cyber is immensely complicated and therefore necessitates a logical template within which to examine capabilities. There is a need for a differentiation between the domestic (defensive) and the foreign (offensive) battlespace. This distinction is important both for tasking and decision-making. When the two battlespaces are separated, they are able to inform one another. Table 7.2 highlights many of the primary areas for consideration within the two battlespaces necessary for DBA and DBK.\nThe INTs above can and should be focused on these and related areas within the cyber domain. A holistic picture of the above components of the domain will\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER SEVEN\nTABLE 7.2 Components of Cyber DBA and DBK\n|  Domestic (Defense Oriented) | Foreign (Offense Oriented)  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  Policy considerations (offensive & defensive) | Policy considerations (offensive & defensive)  |\n|  Domestic network mapping | Foreign network mapping  |\n|  Budget allocations | Budget allocations  |\n|  ICT collaboration (alliances, partnerships) | Offensive unit size & training  |\n|  Defensive unit size & training | Defensive unit size & training  |\n|  Critical infrastructure | Critical infrastructure  |\n|  Insider threats for defensive purposes | Insider threats for offensive purposes  |\n|  Threat spectrum capabilities | Historical record of attack and defense  |\n|  Known vulnerabilities | Threat spectrum capabilities  |\n|  Time to attack recognition | Known vulnerabilities  |\n|  Time to attack attribution | ICT collaborations (alliances, partnerships)  |\n|  Systemic dependencies | Time to attack recognition  |\n|  Monitoring | Time to attack attribution  |\n|   | Systemic dependencies  |\n|   | Surveillance  |\n|   | Reconnaissance  |\nprovide decision-makers with a clearer visualization of the battlespace. Again, following Waltz, a visualization of any battlespace includes the following:\n1. Developing a clear understanding of the state with relation to the enemy and environment.\n2. Envisioning a desired goal or objective representing the successful completion of the mission.\n3. Visualization of the sequence of activities that move the current state to the desired state.\nEdward Amoroso argues the intelligence community should focus on creating an addition to the conventional intelligence briefs that consist solely of information pertaining to cyber. Amoroso indicates such a report should focus on current security posture, top and new security risks, automated metrics, and human interpretation. Amoroso's case for the creation of a cyber-specific intelligence brief is sound and works toward promoting an accurate and realistic understanding of the threats and opportunities within this new and evolving domain relevant to national security.",
    "# POLICY CONSIDERATIONS": "The Joint Chiefs of Staff have placed an increasing emphasis on the cyber domain within various joint doctrine publications. Joint doctrines provide insight into the needs of the services and policy-makers in the employment of and defense against cyber attacks. Documents also include many of the ways cyber\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nThe Role of Intelligence in Cyberspace\nhas come to rely heavily on intelligence assets. Information superiority has become a mission critical aspect of defending national security. The Department of Defense's \"Joint Doctrine for Command and Control Warfare\" dating back to 1996 highlights the importance of intelligence products in support of C2W. The document indicates the use of intelligence assists in the conceptualization of all aspects of a battlespace.\nComprehension of any battlespace, including the cyber domain, requires understanding the policy environment in which an action occurs. Is there a national cyber defense strategy within the targeted country? How have they publicly or privately declared they would respond to hostile acts within the cyber domain? An example of the policy environment can be found in the \"Department of Defense Strategy for Operating in Cyberspace.\" The strategy outlines five strategic initiatives in its declassified report:\nStrategic Initiative 1: Treat cyberspace as an operational domain to organize, train, and equip so that DoD can take full advantage of cyberspace's potential\nStrategic Initiative 2: Employ new defense operating concepts to protect DoD networks and systems\nStrategic Initiative 3: Partner with other U.S. government departments and agencies and the private sector to enable a whole-of-government cyber security strategy\nStrategic Initiative 4: Build robust relationships with U.S. allies and international partners to strengthen collective cyber security\nStrategic Initiative 5: Leverage the nation's ingenuity through an exceptional cyber workforce and rapid technological innovation\nThe recently declassified sections of the report cited in the media indicate a doctrinal shift in the way the DoD approaches the cyber domain. The Wall Street Journal reports that DoD sources as early as 2011 indicated that some instances of cyber attacks can constitute an act of war. This has further developed as recently as September 2014 with the NATO pledge for mutual defense in the event of significant cyber attacks that might result in the invocation of Article 5. When asked what constitutes an act of war in cyberspace that would rise to a level that would result in the successful invocation of Article 5 for mutual defense, NATO secretary general Rasmussen said that the goal was to achieve \"strategic ambiguity\" to keep adversaries guessing and to act as \"ambiguous deterrence.\"\nAlthough the current position on what constitutes an act of war in cyberspace within the eyes of the United States and NATO remains uncertain, understanding the policy positions within the domestic battlespace and in the foreign battlespace helps alleviate information asymmetries and establish clearly identifiable patterns for response. Whether it is the knowledge that Germany and the Netherlands both have official cyber security doctrines or that China has begun implementing a policy of making offensive cyber capabilities a strategic priority,\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER SEVEN\nthe overt and covert collection of policy positions provides policy-makers with a foundation for understanding intelligence related to cyber.\nPolicy platforms also help to codify international law, to create zones of norms or an identifiable policy framework in which states will interact or respond to incidents emanating from cyberspace.³⁵ While both the United States and Russia have made known a cyber attack could constitute an act of war, there has been little elaboration on specific characteristics of such an attack within the official policy-making circles of government. Often states will intentionally leave room for policy ambiguity as a mechanism of deterrence.³⁶ Understanding ambiguity, information gaps, and information asymmetry is crucial particularly in comprehending how leaders arrive at decisions. As in conventional warfare, in cyber conflict the minimization of or the knowledge about what a potential adversary will do in a given situation provides a strategic edge. Although there has been little in the form of codified policy delineation on what level of cyber attack would constitute an act of war, the academic community has been heavily engaged in attempting to apply existing legal frameworks to the cyber domain. The most notable work in this arena is the Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare, which works through in rigorous detail how actions within cyberspace could fall within existing international law.³⁷ Yet as rigorous as the work is, there is no single government required to adhere to its findings on the applicability of international law, and even within the laws themselves there was a significant amount of debate as to what constituted various levels of action in cyberspace. Instead of thinking of sponsored academic works such as the Tallinn Manual as clear policies to which states should adhere, they should be instead thought of as roadmaps to guide states in developing policies.",
    "# CE—NETWORK MAPPING, SYSTEMIC DEPENDENCIES, AND HISTORICAL RECORDS": "Understanding the policy environment both domestically and among foreign adversaries is only part of the larger intelligence process. Cyber exploitation (CE) constitutes a series of technological and analytical approaches to cyber-specific espionage. CE for the purposes of conventional intelligence collection can include the penetration of foreign networks to secure information on weapons systems, policy positions, and much more. CE is invasive yet does not disrupt, deny, or destroy data; it collects data. When CE operations focus intelligence on the cyber domain for offensive and defensive purposes, the objective is to understand the systems themselves. The goal becomes identifying the strengths and weaknesses of systems, the connectivity of systems to points of interests, and the interaction of those systems with strategic and tactical objectives.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nThe Role of Intelligence in Cyberspace\nThere are numerous methods of CE; for the purposes of simplicity only a few are examined here. Network mapping is a form of CE that studies the physical connectivity of networks or the availability of insecure ports. This type of mapping provides information on what types of systems and servers operate on different networks and identifies the characteristics of the various component parts these systems constitute. Network mapping can drill down to very low levels on particular networks and provide significant information speed and types of hardware on various networks. This information can also be used to isolate portions of networks to identify potential heavy traffic users or other sources of potential exploitation.\nNetwork mapping is also useful for illustrating the potential for any particular targeted attack to extend beyond its intended target and result in collateral damage or blowback. Conceptually network mapping is not dissimilar from attempting to map radar or surface-to-air missile locations prior to a bombing campaign. The intent of network mapping is to gain an operational knowledge of an adversary's systems prior to engaging in an OCO.\nForensic analysis of the Stuxnet worm found the worm partially employed network mapping to target its attacks, focusing on isolated networks using memory sticks as the initial method of transmission. Once in, Stuxnet focused its attack on networks with programmable logic controllers (PLCs) of a specific type and caused uranium enrichment centrifuges to malfunction. The level of sophistication required to drill down to get to this level of detail to plan an attack is remarkable, particularly considering the complexity and number of overall systems and the air-gapped nature of the systems.\nNetwork mapping is both an offensive and defensive intelligence endeavor. To adequately prepare both the defensive and offensive battlespaces, an accurate picture of systems is needed. Arguably the dual domestic-foreign pictures are complementary and help avoid violating part 2.13 of Executive Order 12333, which prevents any covert action from influencing U.S. political processes, public opinion, policies, media, or various sections of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.\nNetwork mapping and monitoring is a double-edged sword. Legally network mapping can be considered CE, and therefore domestic network mapping by U.S. intelligence agencies without a warrant would be prohibited. However, network mapping is of critical importance to the maintenance of national security infrastructures. Thus far the intelligence community does not have a formal commitment from the White House or the Justice Department to engage in any domestic CE operations. Currently in the United States there is an uneasy and inefficient public-private commitment to providing information on network security across critical infrastructure. A thorough understanding of domestic and foreign networks assists in visualization for both offensive and defensive\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER SEVEN\npurposes, and effort to push reasoned analysis of threats has begun to make its way into Congress.⁴²\nNetwork mapping assists in the identification of network components. Once network components are known, it becomes necessary to explore vulnerabilities within systems. Most damaging are zero-day vulnerabilities, which are vulnerabilities in computer applications of which even system administrators are unaware. The Stuxnet attack exposed several zero-day vulnerabilities in the Windows software controlling/monitoring the programmable logic controllers, causing the attached centrifuges to spin outside of their safe operational standards.\nSystemic vulnerabilities necessitate a thorough understanding of the historical record of different types of attacks and exploits. The identification of zero-day vulnerabilities should lead network administrators to immediately patch these gaps. Intelligence plays a role in identifying what types of attacks have been used in the past and what vulnerabilities these attacks attempted to exploit. Historical accounting is important for both offensive and defensive preparation of the battlespace. For obvious reasons it is important to prevent repeat attacks on domestic systems; at the same time it is important not to engage in repeat attack methods once a vulnerability on an opposing system has been fixed. Such an attack would likely be ineffective and lead to anonymity-attribution problems.\nThe historical accounting of attack types by countries and substate actors also alerts operators within the intelligence and military community to the threat spectrum capabilities of a particular cyber adversary. Understanding the threat spectrum capabilities of states facilitates an accurate conceptualization of their power to operate within the domain. Table 7.3 is a representation of known threat spectrum capabilities.\nThe above areas of consideration within CE are only a small sampling of the overall tasking priorities for intelligence using CE methods. They hint at a broad applicability for CYBERINT methods in the preparation of the battlespace.",
    "# CONVENTIONAL INTELLIGENCE": "Intelligence collected on budgetary allocations, offensive and defensive cyber unit sizes, and training methodologies provides the clearest parallel to conventional intelligence. As in conventional intelligence, most countries are frequently unwilling to release data on absolute military expenditures or the sizes and force structures within their military. Military capabilities are a closely guarded secret in most countries. Capabilities are particularly secretive in the cyber domain. Often if cyber capabilities are exposed, they cease to be capabilities.⁴³ Once Stuxnet was discovered by the Iranians, defensive measures were taken to \"plug\" the holes the Stuxnet attack employed.

Whereas missiles can be launched with repeated success because the ability to defend against a moving projectile is difficult, a similar cyber weapon is more easily defended against once it has been identified. Antivirus software can be reprogrammed to identify and isolate repeat threats, and zero-day vulnerabilities can be patched.\nAn excellent example of an open source analysis of cyber capabilities comes from Stokes, Lin, and Hsiao, who examine in explicit detail the construction, location, leadership, and mission of many aspects of the Chinese People's Liberation Army information warfare programs.⁴⁴ Their report is an example of a high-value detailed analysis that could be supplemented by conventional intelligence to enhance policy-maker and combatant commander comprehension of the battlespace. The detailed analysis of the location and force structure can cause an enemy to shift its tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and make them less reliable. Alternatively, not revealing that information has been gained on TTPs can provide an offensive edge in cyber operations.\nThe implications for conventional intelligence collection methods indicate that intelligence on cyber does not necessarily need to remain cyberbound or exclusively within the realm of CE. Many metrics such as force size matter in cyber and can be examined to create a better assessment of potential adversaries. Cyber force size is particularly important from a malware development perspective. Complex coding scripts typically necessitate large numbers of programmers to develop and test the scripts. The ability for an individual to accomplish highly complex attacks is possible but less likely than a large cyber warfare unit working with the same objective.\nLikewise, knowing where a unit is located or how programmers were trained can help planners determine the best response to a particular attack, or how best to manipulate their organizational structure. Derek Clark and Kai Konrad refer to this as identifying the weakest link.⁴⁵ The identification of the weakest link is particularly important in cyber defense and offense. There are multiple fronts (systems) needing defense. All it takes is one \"best shot\" to achieve significant damage. While this weakest link can be identified through CE operations outlined in the previous section, it can also be identified within the training, command, and organizational structure of units charged with conducting or protecting against cyber attacks.\nClosely related to the conventional military metrics above, yet likely unique to the cyber domain, are public-private ICT collaborations. Although most countries have programs for military public and private collaborations with universities and businesses for research and development, within the cyber domain the importance of this relationship is magnified for multiple reasons. First, much of the training and education necessary to conduct offensive or defensive oper\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nThe Role of Intelligence in Cyberspace\nations within cyberspace can be learned at public institutions or can be crafted for private sector use. This extends far beyond the development of technology to the actual training of the warfighter, the development of the platforms upon which the domain rests, and more. Second, these collaborations spread out but do not diffuse potential vulnerabilities.\nBecause collaborations can form the foundational aspects of the cyber warriors within offensive and defensive units, they can train, equip, and prepare in ways far different from conventional military means. Most countries have a balance between civilian and military protection of their national cyber infrastructures based largely on the development of computer emergency response teams (CERTs). An intelligence assessment of the strength and quality of ICT collaborations is of critical importance in understanding the cyber battlespace.\nICT collaborations are not necessarily official and do not need to be highly structured and regimented. Alexander Klimburg provides evidence Russia and China have created groups of plausibly deniable cyber attackers. Creating an accurate open source measure of unofficial collaborations is difficult. An intelligence focus on unofficial collaborations with entities can contextualize cyber incidents such as the 2007 cyber attacks directed at Estonian governmental, bank, and communications websites. The attacks were motivated by a decision to move a Russian war memorial from central Tallinn. While initial reports indicated Russia was the culprit, Russia denied any participation in the cyber attacks. The reality is somewhat murkier and more akin to an unofficial sanction or condoning of cyber attacks by the Russian government.\nThe collection and production of intelligence on more conventional attributes of pertinence to the cyber domain is a role in which the intelligence community is likely already engaged. Occasionally reports on issues relating to this category of intelligence are published for public consumption. A recent report of this type was produced for the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission to examine China's capability to conduct cyber warfare and cyber exploitation. Knowledge of capabilities is still applicable to the cyber domain and is greatly influenced by conventional intelligence collection methods and subsequent analysis, which contextualizes the meaning of raw intelligence.\n## HUMINT AND CYBER\nHuman intelligence (HUMINT) stands out in cyber for two particular reasons. First, HUMINT agents can provide accurate internal information on systems and access to those systems unavailable through CE and other intelligence collection methods. Second, human assets can serve as a bridge between the external world and air-gapped or other forms of secure networks. As was indicated above, it is likely that the Stuxnet virus was distributed using a thumb drive,\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER SEVEN\nwhich needed to be inserted into a machine within an air-gapped network. HUMINT agents can serve as a vulnerability against which most network administrators will be unable to provide significant protection.\nThe role of a HUMINT asset with access to information on networks can be extremely damaging. Even if the agent is on a lightly classified network, the repercussions of his or her actions can be enormous. The scandal caused by Bradley Manning (now named Chelsea Manning) leaking more than 260,000 diplomatic cables to WikiLeaks in 2010 is illustrative of the problem posed by internal threats.⁵¹ Manning’s leak and the even more damaging 2013 document releases by Edward Snowden, a former employee of a contractor affiliated with both the NSA and CIA, highlight the potential damage a rogue employee can have on the ability of the intelligence community to keep information secret.⁵² Snowden’s insider collection and subsequent release of documents pertaining to the National Security Agency likely constitutes one of the most significant intelligence leaks of all time and resulted in an estimated 1.7 million documents being released in violation of U.S. classification law.⁵³ Moreover, unlike the leaks by Manning, the Snowden leaks revealed many of the TTPs used by the NSA in its intelligence operations in the cyber domain. These revelations have been extremely damaging and have resulted in changes in the way adversaries safeguard their cyber infrastructure.\nHUMINT threats need to be developed and enhanced for offensive intelligence and protected against for domestic national security counterintelligence. Gaining access to the technical schematics, documents, information, login procedures, or any of a multitude of other targets of intelligence a HUMINT asset could provide is a critical aspect added directly by intelligence to the understanding of the cyber domain. Furthermore, HUMINT agents are almost impossible to detect under normal circumstances as they can often engage in significant espionage while still easily performing the normal duties. Unlike the spy thriller days of old when agents had to sneak out of a building with classified documents in a folder or a box, they can often place thousands or millions of documents on a solid-state drive and easily conceal it upon exiting a facility. Many of these drives are smaller in size than a penny.\nBeyond the collection of intelligence from HUMINT sources, these insiders can assist in the implementation of cyber actions. Information within a 2005 report by the U.S. Secret Service in cooperation with Carnegie Mellon indicated that up to 29 percent of all attacks against a surveyed group of critical infrastructure stakeholders were initiated by insiders.⁵⁴ The majority of motivations behind these attacks were not related to intelligence or covert action. This, however, does not preclude the possibility of using insiders to affect or gain information or access on adversary systems. The recruitment and maintenance of insider threats by the intelligence community should be a top priority. These\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nThe Role of Intelligence in Cyberspace\nFIGURE 7.1 Timeline for Attack Implementation\nagents can offer a mission a critical component, often during times when more lengthy intelligence collection processes are constrained by events.",
    "# TIME FOR ATTACK RECOGNITION, COMPLETION, AND ATTRIBUTION": "Attack recognition and attribution are also critical for both a defensive and offensive battlespace planning. All of the intelligence collection methods and the focus of the intel process of trying to comprehend the cyber domain culminate in understanding, from a mission critical orientation, the progression of cyber attacks. Figure 7.1 is a simplified model for understanding attack planning and progression within a battlespace modeled loosely on the JP 3-51 electronic warfare-planning model. This model is informed by intelligence collection. Line one of the figure indicates a policy-maker's perspective on the process of engaging in conflict. A conflict initiation is (o) planned, (1) implemented, and (2) completed. Policy-makers want to know what resources any given action will take and how long it will take to complete it. In cyber a more accurate timeline for action in cyberspace requires (o) intelligence collection, (1) operational planning of the attack with an informed knowledge of the battlespace, (2) understanding of the time it takes for the attack to be completed, (3) how long until the attack is recognized as an attack by the adversary, (4) how long until that adversary can do something about the attack, (5) how long until the adversary assigns attribution for the attack. The ordering of the items listed above greatly affects the ability for an attack to be conducted successfully. Intelligence informs the policy-maker and commander as to the feasibility of a particular type of attack and the probability of success. If recognition of an attack occurs early in the timeline of events the probability of success is diminished.\nThe timeline can be tested in much the same way conventional weapons are tested. It would be absurd to send a bomber over a potential target with a completely untested bomb, or to send a soldier into battle with an untested model of rifle. Just as weapons are tested in the physical world, they need to be tested in the cyber domain as well. This testing provides added information to both\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER SEVEN\nFIGURE 7.2 The Influence of Intelligence on Cyber Operations\nModified from E. Waltz, Information Warfare.\nthe policy-maker and the combatant commander as to the effectiveness of the weapon and the timeline of events above. If a cyber weapon is slow and easily detectable, its probability for success is diminished. This lowered probability for success does not nullify its use but does condition it.\nOne aspect of this phase of IPB is that it is extremely beneficial to both the offensive and defensive strategic and tactical operations. By planning and testing potential attacks against theoretical adversarial systems, the intelligence community provides an out-of-the-box perspective necessary to prevent similar attacks against domestic targets. This logic would indicate an attempt to use a worm like Stuxnet against the U.S. infrastructure would run into greater problems than if the weapon had been developed first elsewhere.",
    "# IPB AND ITS IMPACT ON CYBER": "The role of intelligence in cyber is not dissimilar from its role in the conventional domains. There are new areas in which collection and analysis need to occur, yet its overall objective remains the same. Returning to Edward Waltz's concept of information preparation of the battlefield, figure 7.2 illustrates intelligence's influence on operations originating within the cyber domain. The role of intelligence in cyber is to accurately facilitate an understanding of those\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nThe Role of Intelligence in Cyberspace\nentities and the possible tools by which to influence them. The cyber domain is surrounded with hype and hysteria. Many of the claims are accurately based in reality. But the known unknowns are still enormous within this evolving domain, and it is incumbent on intelligence to provide an accurate assessment of the current state of affairs.\nAll-source intelligence for cyber operations requires the intelligence community to think beyond domestic system defense. The focus should be balanced between foreign and domestic intelligence, thereby mutually informing one another and creating a systemic defense for national assets in addition to better facilitating decision-makers with a more accurate picture of how a potential cyber attack might succeed or fail.",
    "# CYBER AS COVERT ACTION": "To further define the role of intelligence in cyber, it is necessary to look more deeply into the laws codifying the conduct of the intelligence community. All of the above sections provide a framework for defining the role of intelligence with regard to IPB. Cyber conflict is, by its very nature, covert. Even if an attack is discovered, it is often unattributable. Attacks can be designed to go unnoticed and affect changes to systems and their components for days, weeks, or months without detection. Even in instances where groups such as Anonymous publically take credit for attacks, responsibility is typically claimed post hoc. Nearly all examples of state-on-state cyber attacks have been covert.\nThe covert nature of cyber brings full circle Warner's definition of intelligence as attempting to influence. Covert action is a secret operation to influence a foreign entity. At least in theory, most, if not all, cyber attacks begin covertly. Section 1.7(a)(4) of Executive Order 12333 regarding intelligence activities describes covert action:\nConduct convert action activities approved by the President. No agency except the Central Intelligence Agency (or the Armed Forces of the United States in time of war declared by the Congress or during any period covered by a report from the President to the Congress consistent with the War Powers Resolution, Public Law 93-148) may conduct any covert action activity unless the President determines that another agency is more likely to achieve a particular objective.\nEvident in the early structuring of the governmental approach to cyberspace is the categorization of cyber operations as covert actions. The Department of Defense originally took the lead with General Keith Alexander as the head of both NSA and Cyber Command, a path that has continued now that Admiral Michael Rogers has taken over as the head of both organizations. This indicates the president has established an agency other than the Central Intelligence\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER SEVEN\nAgency as the primary covert operator within this domain. While the logic behind having a military intelligence organization commander and an organizational structure that falls under the U.S. Strategic Command (STRATCOM) runs counter to EO 12333, the institutional capacity of the DoD in the technical domain and the scale of the problem being faced within this new domain make the assignment appropriate.",
    "# SUMMARIZING THE ROLE OF INTELLIGENCE WITHIN THE CYBER DOMAIN": "In defining the role of intelligence within the cyber domain, it is necessary to take a holistic approach. From a collection perspective, the intelligence community should be and has been working in coordination with a hybrid push-and-pull intelligence cycle to both elevate the importance of this domain and facilitate collection within it. The emphasis has been heavily defensive up to this point and largely focused on countering threats rather than anticipating them. This needs to change, and the only way this can change is if the intelligence community begins to actively turn its sights on adversaries and develop more rigorous all-source intelligence combining novel CYBERINT technologies to augment reporting on this domain. Parroting Amoroso's assertion, cyber should be included on the daily intelligence briefs of policy-makers. The inclusion would likely start the process of demystification of this immensely complicated domain.\nCyberspace is a domain that can be used to fulfill all aspects of Warner's definition of intelligence to some degree. It is a domain in which it is possible to gain understanding about other states beyond and within the domain itself, but it is also a domain that can influence other states' policy decisions as well as perceptions. In particular, accurate intelligence on both sides of the domestic-foreign divide can mutually inform decision-makers about vulnerabilities and the eventual decision to use cyber as an offensive weapon or how best to defend against attacks. Moreover, intelligence can rein in the debate on cyber to a more realistic area of operations predicated on sound estimates rather than on grandiose speculation.\nThe intelligence community itself commonly is the point of origin for OCOs emanating from the cyber domain and will likely serve as a force multiplier in instances where a combined conventional cyber attack is necessary. To engage in cyber conflict, just as in conventional conflict, intelligence is needed to prepare the battlespace and facilitate an accurate assessment of the probability for success and utility for any type of operation. This preparation hones the weapons, decisions, and effect of a potential operation. More importantly for national security, a thorough and accurate preparation of both the foreign and domestic battlespaces will serve to inform and enhance cyber security.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms"

Intelligence is increasingly facilitating information superiority through an understanding of the cyber domain. The Department of Defense's \"Joint Vision 2020\" establishes the goal of information superiority on the battlefield. This information superiority enables decision superiority and favorably tilts the strategic and tactical balance. Information superiority is built on cyber power, scale and complexity of attacks, robustness of defense, policy positions, systemic vulnerabilities and dependencies, and actor anonymity and attribution issues. Intelligence plays a mission critical role in assessing these characteristics. The discussion below examines the role of intelligence in identifying these characteristics within the cyber domain and examines how it influences the decision-making of policy-makers. Specifically the focus hones in on how intelligence increases the effectiveness of identifying potential attackers within the cyber domain and informs the decision-making of policy-makers when engaging in covert cyber action directed against a potential adversary. The discussion is designed to serve as a strategic framework in which to understand the role of intelligence within the cyber domain.\nIs it really necessary to examine the role of intelligence within the cyber domain as contextually different than in a conventional domain? The short answer is yes. Cyber necessitates independent examination because it is characteristically different, and yet at the same time it is a pervasive feature affecting outcomes within other domains. What differentiates cyber from land, sea, air, and space are three fundamental attributes relevant to intelligence practitioners. First, the cyber domain is a man-made domain. Second, military capabilities across the other domains are managed through the cyber domain. Third, military and civilian aspects of the cyber domain are often intertwined and difficult to differentiate. These attributes pose unique opportunities and problems for intelligence officials.\nThe man-made nature of the cyber domain makes it a largely virtual domain with its value corresponding to the speed and volume of information contained\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER SEVEN\nwithin it. However, the cyber domain is not entirely virtual and has numerous real-world connection points to everything from industrial control systems of power and water management facilities to the weapon systems of drones flying above distant battlefields.\nCyberspace is not tangible in the same way as more conventional domains and therefore necessitates a new form of dynamic intelligence evolving from all-source collection of conventional and novel intelligence sources. A recent National Research Council report states that intelligence in the cyber domain is useful for both strategic and tactical purposes.¹ The strategic and tactical importance of intelligence's role in influencing the cyber domain falls within the concept of all-source intelligence. Loch Johnson defines all-source intelligence as one of the fundamental propositions of a theory of strategic intelligence.² More importantly for the purposes of understanding the operational and political environments within which offensive and defensive actions in cyberspace can occur, it is necessary to understand what intelligence is within decisions regarding the cyber domain and how intelligence influences those decisions.\n## DEFINING INTELLIGENCE\nThere are dozens of different definitions of intelligence, each of which is in some way applicable to understanding cyber action. One of the more succinct and conceptually ordered comes from Michael Warner, who defines intelligence as a \"secret, state activity to understand or influence foreign entities.\"³ His definition establishes the fundamental premises of both collection and analysis, while including actions designed to influence. Intelligence is vital to the cyber domain because foreign entities are increasingly storing, managing, and directing their governmental, public, private, and military functions in a digitized world.\nThe traditional intelligence collection types (INTs) are still of immense value, yet they must be combined with aspects of the digitized target spectrum to provide a holistic view of both threats and opportunities. At present the majority of studies in the public domain have focused on defense.⁴ This defensive posture is made clear by General Keith Alexander, the director of the National Security Agency and commander of United States Cyber Command, when he writes: \"US Cyber Command's efforts and planning aim to ensure that the DoD has done all it can to defend and deter determined adversaries, mitigate dangerous threats, and address nagging vulnerabilities, so that even our most capable opponents will know that interfering with our nation's equities in cyberspace is a losing proposition.\"⁵\nThis defensive and deterrent-reliant posture is limiting and prone to inadequacies. Echoing Machiavelli and to some extent Sun Tzu, the adage \"the best defense is a good offense\" offers a novel way of considering action and intelli\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nThe Role of Intelligence in Cyberspace [103]\ngence within cyber. More accurately, it allows for a systematic approach to both national cyber defensive and offensive resource allocations. Beyond the efficiency argument for shifting the focus from solely defense to a balance between defense and offense, intelligence collection can help to inform offensive strategies and the decision to use cyber as a weapon. The role of intelligence within cyber becomes increasingly important when considering the difficulty of achieving any significant measure of deterrence within the cyber domain.⁶\nThe defensive orientation of the majority of cyber literature has a constraining effect on decision-making processes for the use of offensive cyber weapons. This defensive focus is largely due to both the alarmist calls of some scholars and policy-makers and an information communications technologies industry orientation offering many more strategies for defense than for offense. While I do not dispute the need for defense, this defensive focus leads the national security establishment down a path of attempting to create an impenetrable system. If there is one thing that is abundantly clear in the cyber domain it is that the only impenetrable system is the one that has not been made. Cyber is based on physics and algorithms. The mathematics and science behind security measures can be immensely complex and take massive computing power to penetrate, but that does not make them impenetrable. Even the most robust systems secured with checks and encryptions are still highly vulnerable to their users' ignorance or malice, as was the case with Edward Snowden in 2013.\nInstead of focusing on a solely carte blanche defensive posture toward cyber security, intelligence can provide both an offensive and defensive picture more effective at safeguarding national security. Taking a step back from the conventional cyber security literature, intelligence can direct cyber security efforts to not merely safeguard national security but also provide an offensive tool for use against other states. The vast literature on intelligence, ranging from the way intelligence influences the policy-making process to how it helps to understand aspects of the development of utility for actions, serves as a guide in defining the role of intelligence within the cyber domain.\nReflecting on Warner's definition of intelligence, the spectrum of intelligence collection methods—from human intelligence (HUMINT) to the more technical collection methods of signals intelligence (SIGINT), measurement and signatures intelligence (MASINT), geospatial intelligence (GEOINT), and open source intelligence (OSINT)—works together in an all-source environment to provide an accurate understanding of foreign entities. (Table 7.1 provides a quick definitional reference for the various intelligence collection types.) The understanding provided by intelligence has largely focused on the conventional domains and on political decision-making. However, as decisions in conventional domains increasingly migrate toward cyberspace, and the systems controlling the tools used in these domains increasingly become digitally connected, the\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER SEVEN\nTABLE 7.1 Intelligence Collection Methods\n|  Intelligence Source Type | Definition  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  Open Source (OSINT) | Overtly available information found, selected, and acquired from publicly available source.  |\n|  Measurement and Signatures (MASINT) | Intelligence detected and classified from targets that identify or describe signatures (distinctive characteristics) of fixed or dynamic target sources.  |\n|  Human (HUMINT) | Intelligence collected through interpersonal contact via human collection officers.  |\n|  Geospatial (GEOINT)* | The exploitation and analysis of imagery and geospatial information to describe, assess, and visually depict physical features and geographically referenced activities on the earth.

Williams, Shimeal, and Dunlevy, \"Intelligence Analysis for Internet Security.\" CYBERINT is considered independent of traditional SIGINT. However, as in many of the other types of intelligence collection, techniques and agencies often overlap.\nimportance of understanding the technical schematics and decision processes becomes vital to national security.\nNick Cullather, in an article on digital connections on the battlefield, indicates significant advances in the development of network-centric warfare. Cullather notes that the rise of a \"revolution in military affairs\" has largely not been matched by the intelligence community's ability to keep up.[7] This is of particular importance when looking beyond the network-centric battlefield of conventional weapons to the new zone of confrontation within cyberspace itself. Similarly, Michael Herman finds that counterterrorism intelligence analysis requires a broad spectrum of information sources brought together.[8] ICT facilitates the mitigation of \"stovepipes\" and increases the efficiency in information transference.[9] Information transmission has also been facilitated following the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 by the creation of \"fusion centers.\"[10] ICT has a role to play not only in the conduct of war on the battlefield, but also in the management of a conventional traditional threat spectrum within the fusion centers and beyond in the wider intelligence community.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nThe Role of Intelligence in Cyberspace [105]\nTerrorism is not commonly regarded as part of the conventional threat spectrum, yet in reality most terrorist acts take place in the physical world and require bombs and guns. However, the information coordination necessary to organize, plan, and conduct warfare, terrorist acts, and political strategies has largely shifted to cyberspace. The 2008 Mumbai terrorist attacks are a poignant example of terrorists leveraging technology and open source intelligence collected from public sites and software such as Google Earth to plan and orchestrate mass murder.[11] As horrific as the use of digital tools for planning attacks is, it is not isolated to open source intelligence collection via tools. Terrorists also use open source cryptography and crypto-currencies to finance their operations.[12] Intelligence agencies are in a competition with other states and organizations to leverage tools effectively to prevent attacks by terrorists and to mitigate international incidents before they arise.\nWhile open source research is fundamentally more powerful than ever before, available open source information provides only a limited aperture to realistically size up threats and targets within cyberspace itself. The problem of intelligence in cyberspace is massive both in terms of scale and complexity of data. Joel Brenner, a former inspector general of the National Security Agency and head of U.S. counterintelligence, indicated there has been an enormous threat emanating from within cyberspace that is not being adequately addressed.[13]\nModern warfare, command and control warfare (C2W), is network centric. Large swaths of the national critical infrastructures in states that pose conventional security and economic threats to the United States are controlled by digital systems. The literature is less focused on the need for understanding these vulnerabilities than it is on safeguarding them. The defensive focus, to a large degree, overshadows the development of offensive capabilities.\nPhil Williams, Timothy Shimeal, and Casey Dunlevy make a well-reasoned case arguing for focused intelligence efforts on identifying threats to national cyber security.[14] These authors make a valid point that needs to be addressed and is being addressed by several national strategy documents on the topic, including the National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace and the \"International Strategy for Cyberspace.\" One report of particular importance addressing many of the issues brought up by Williams, Shimeal, and Dunlevy is the October 2011 report by the Office of the National Counterintelligence Executive on cyber espionage.[15] A broad spectrum of federal strategies and reports has made identification and protection against vulnerabilities a top priority. More recently the president of the United States under Executive Order 13636 in February 2013 directed the government to begin actively seeking out and planning strategies to mitigate cyber threats to national critical infrastructure.\nThis is a process that is under way and includes an alphabet soup of agencies from across the civilian and military spectrum of the government. A re\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER SEVEN\ncurrent problem that keeps cropping up in many of the discussions on critical infrastructure is network awareness. Many companies and firms affiliated with critical infrastructure do not have an adequate understanding of their own vulnerabilities, let alone how they interact to create systemic threats. One industry based on personal communications and working experience that seems to be working very hard to address these issues is the U.S. financial sector, which in many ways is pioneering cyber security efforts under E.O. 13636.\nCurrently most cyber security is based on attacks or incidents in progress or that have already occurred. It is difficult, if not impossible, to defend against an unknown attack. Much of the effort in the United States cyber community now seems to be equivalent to plugging the holes in the dike after it floods. It is a fact that most cyber attacks are repeat attacks originating at the lower end of the threat spectrum, making the strategy of filling holes in the dike an absolute necessity in an effort to prevent repeat intrusions from identical or similar malware types. Yet this post hoc strategy largely fails to address the more serious problem of accurately anticipating what the next type of attack is going to be. This strategy, best referred to as a \"Maginot Line\" strategy, is prone to failure in areas where technological and strategic capabilities rapidly evolve. The real challenge is to develop intelligence-based approaches to cyberspace that prevent future attacks before they happen.\nThere is a significant and sustained effort underway on the defensive side of the cyber debate within the DoD to develop better security. The DoD is currently employing at least three categories of defensive teams to facilitate DoD network protection: DoD information network operations teams (DoDIN Ops), defensive cyber operations—internal defensive measures teams (DCO-IDM or cyber protection teams), and defensive cyber operations—response action teams (DCO-RA or national mission teams).[16] Yet all of these teams are heavily reliant on intelligence on the cyber environment for defense (ICE-D). The teams that fit into these categories are tasked with segments of the overall problem. While the DoDIN-Ops teams are tasked with ensuring sustained secure operations on DoD networks, they are not focused on adversary behaviors in those networks. Their work is informed by adversary behaviors but seeks to maintain network security in aggregate. DCO-IDM or cyber protection teams function as hunter killers within the network. They are tasked with seeking out individuals engaging DoD networks illegally and stopping the attacks or exploits. DCO-RA or national mission teams are tasked with responding to adversary behavior in DoD networks. As should be readily apparent, the problem is enormous and relies on intelligence for all aspects of ICE-D functions. The DoD network environment alone is composed of millions of computing devices and users.\nBecause we exist in a world of known unknowns and unknown unknowns, to paraphrase Secretary Rumsfeld, cyber security is likely the former rather than\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nThe Role of Intelligence in Cyberspace [107]\nthe latter.¹⁷ How can intelligence be used to improve the cyber security situation not only to protect the national infrastructure in a more systematic and logical manner but also to use this information to inform the decision-making processes of policy-makers?\nOne problem associated with the U.S. cyber community is proximity. Because the community develops, tests, and employs its own tools, it is unable to take into account methods of testing that have not yet threatened systems in the past. This is an in-the-box, out-of-the-box, forget-the-box problem. The designers of systems, software, and networks are talented and smart individuals; they lead the world in technical innovation, yet because they are inside their own systems, it becomes it intrinsically difficult to isolate unforeseen problems. United States Cyber Command and various other teams from the services and the various academies have tried to address this problem by creating competitive cyber teams that compete with one other and against civilian competitors in various challenges such as DefCon capture the flag contests and others. These various DCO and DoDIN-Ops teams also engage one another to consistently foster novel thinking on security.\nYet the challenge is immense, and solutions are best achieved by constant introspection. Below are several proposed strategies to help facilitate the development of improved defensive operations. First, the current orientation toward plugging holes must continue. While this post hoc process is frustrating, it prevents or at least slows further intrusions. The mentality of these DoDIN-Ops is one of defense. The objective is to secure and defend systems against all possible or known types of attacks. The most realistic approach is to defend against known types of attacks. The systems become fortified against repeat incidents or at least can minimize their severity. The work of these teams is not sexy; it is not offense oriented; it is a process of continuous network security development. Second, DCO-IDM teams must also actively hunt in government and defense networks for potential adversaries and leverage information gained through all source intelligence collection and communication with DoDIN-Ops, DCO-RA, and OCO teams to anticipate potential blind spots. These teams must also be regularly rotated to provide them time to think like attackers. Third, DCO-RA teams must leverage all-source intelligence and continuous communications with DCO-IDM and OCO teams to engage adversaries in a defensive posture on foreign networks before they endanger DoD networks. While these teams are in the process of getting organized and established, it is important that these teams have clear interteam communications to mitigate stovepiping. The co-location or consistent rotation of team members would likely facilitate enhanced operational results. The co-location and coordination of members within a team should be of paramount importance as it allows analysts and technicians the opportunity to collaborate and developed a detailed and synergistic understanding of capabilities.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER SEVEN\nThe wider intelligence community must use all-source methods to collect as much intelligence on potential opponents as possible. This means profiling every aspect of other nations' cyber offensive and defensive capabilities. This requires a robust all-source collection methodology. Signals intelligence must look for transmissions and communications as well as spikes in Internet traffic and geo-locate them using IP addresses. These geo-located IP addresses need to be analyzed using satellites and drones to provide accurate geospatial information on the areas in question. Open source intelligence collection should attempt to gain as much publicly available information as possible on areas of interest through legal means. Once all of this information has been compiled and assessed, targeted HUMINT operations should begin working on developing assets within these areas or with connections to these areas. These agents should be recruited for multiple purposes. First, they should be used to secure intelligence on the capabilities of potential adversaries. These capabilities are defined in more detail below. Second, agents should also be recruited to become potential insider threats, a tool of particular importance on air-gapped systems.[18] Third, intelligence agencies should also place an emphasis on cyber exploitation (CE) and attempt to probe and map out network infrastructures, vulnerabilities, and strengths of adversaries. The last point is of importance both from an offensive and defensive strategic orientation.\nAnother major problem with the cyber domain arises out of its systemic complexity. As Williams, Shimeal, and Dunlevy accurately note, cyber defenders often do not have a realistic or accurate picture of their own systems, let alone the systems of adversaries who are attacking them.[19] Following their recommendations, the national security community would be prudent to make use of the principle of knowing yourself. This requires a consistent focus on domestic systems. However, only focusing on domestic systems leads to the \"Maginot Line\" tendency in which it is assumed networks are created to be impenetrable.\n# INTELLIGENCE AND THE CYBER BATTLESPACE\nThe cyber domain is a modern battlespace and necessitates a holistic understanding. To defend against or engage in offensive actions, it is necessary to have an accurate understanding of the operational environment. According to Edward Waltz, any battlespace, whether offensive or defensive, requires a combination of dominant battlespace awareness (DBA) and dominant battlespace knowledge (DBK).[20] The process of identifying what is and is not important to understanding a particular battlespace largely falls to the discretion of policy-makers within the intelligence cycle.\nIn writing about intelligence and decision-making, Stephen Marrin states: \"the intelligence cycle starts with decision-maker information requirements lev\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nThe Role of Intelligence in Cyberspace [109]\nied on intelligence collection capabilities, the processing of collected raw intelligence and transmission of this processed material to analysts who decipher its meaning, and relay that understanding back to the decision-makers.”²¹\nThe decision-maker engages in tasking through a number of different “pull” mechanisms including governmental reports, hearings before Congress, presidential directives, and executive orders. These tasking methods and others combine to facilitate within the intelligence community an accurate understanding of what constitutes the battlespace in the eyes of the policy-maker. Often the planning and direction can be informal requests from the executive or from Congress, and at other times it can come from official strategy documents.\nPrior to 9/11, terrorism was a priority, but the planning and direction of resources had not yet reached a critical mass sufficient to prevent the terrible attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Marrin and others find the intelligence process frequently fails to adequately define what constitutes a tasking priority for the intelligence community, necessitating a “push” from within the community outward. There are many instances in which policy-makers ignore, misinterpret, or misuse intelligence despite adequate tasking and intelligence production and dissemination.²²\nThe push mechanism of the intelligence community can happen in several ways. Often it can follow what constructivists call “norm entrepreneurs.” Entrepreneurs in the cyber domain include Richard Clarke, or John Arquilla and David Ronfeldt, among others.²³ These individuals bring to national policymakers’ attention issues of importance and help direct the intelligence community’s efforts. If, however, they make outlandish claims and statements, their push for new norms can have a backlash and inspire counter-entrepreneurs such as Thomas Rid, who writes that cyber war does not and will not occur.²⁴ Most traditional intelligence push comes from within the intelligence community itself.²⁵ Because the intelligence community is pushing intelligence not requested by the decision-makers, the concept of the intelligence cycle can, as Marrin notes, become linear.²⁶\nBecause the domain is so complex, it is beneficial for the president and policy-makers to have individuals with the requisite understanding of the domain not only in policy and legal terms but also in technical terms. The position currently established is known as the cyber czar. While this position is typically filled by someone with policy or legal expertise, it is beneficial for that individual to have a wide background and a reasonable technical understanding so he or she can facilitate complex discussions. Former cyber czar Melissa Hathaway would be a prime example of the type of individual who could accurately convey the complexity of the technical and historical attributes of interactions in the domain while at the same time have a firm grasp on the policy and legal implications of future actions. This person then sits at the choke point of the\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER SEVEN\npush and pull on the cyber domain and distills the information into a balanced reality applicable for decision-makers.\nFor intelligence to adequately focus its sights on any battlespace, planning and direction from policy-makers must occur. Once policy-makers have established the importance of a battlespace, the intelligence community must find ways to deliver accurate and reliable intelligence. The objective of intelligence collection is not solely to provide real-time information on the battlespace; rather, it is best thought of as battlespace preparation or what Waltz refers to as \"intelligence preparation of the battlespace\" (IPB).[27] Although Waltz specifically refers to IPB in the context of coordinated conventional warfare and the use of information operations in network-centric warfare, the theoretical principles apply across all domains. IPB, according to Waltz, includes providing an understanding of the \"physical, political, electronic, cyber, and other dimensions of the battlespace.\"[28] Alan D. Campen and Douglas H. Dearth reiterate the concept of IPB in Cyberwar 3.0. They state that information warfare requires an accurate knowledge of the battlespace as well as real-time awareness of situations within the battlespace as they arise.\nBefore moving directly into how each collection type can add to a holistic picture of the battlespace, it is necessary to define what constitutes the battlespace in the cyber domain. The battlespace, according to Waltz, constitutes \"all decision-relevant elements within a defined battlespace, and the ability to predict with very high confidence near-term enemy actions and outcomes.\"[29] More specifically this requires an understanding of human, material, and technical capabilities and the relationship of these capabilities within themselves and to other aspects of the operational environment. It is also important to understand the political implications of alterations in capabilities and the environment over time. A battlespace for cyber can be domestic or foreign and is considered to constitute three basic layers: physical, logical, and social layers. Intelligence must inform policy-makers on all three categories.\nThe physical layer is composed of a geographical location and the physical devices that constitute the environment. These devices can include hardware such as computers, switches, and routers. The devices that compose the physical layer can also include computing devices such as mobile phones, cars, airplanes, and ships. The physical layer also includes those devices used to facilitate cyber actions such as transoceanic cables, power stations, and buildings. Knowing the physical attributes of a target is often important when attempting to create cyber-kinetic responses. The physical structure of a network can provide clues as to the purpose of the network or point to vulnerabilities of constituent components of a network.\nBuilt upon the physical layer is a logical layer, which makes many of the aspects of the physical layer function. Firmware and software combine to form\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nThe Role of Intelligence in Cyberspace [111]\na logical layer. Just as there are numerous components to the physical layer there are hundreds if not thousands of different software and firmware applications that combine to make cyberspace function. When targeting a system it is often necessary to have intelligence on the attributes of the system being attacked. A piece of malware designed for a Windows 7 OS zero-day vulnerability will not work if that malware is deployed to a computer running Mac OS X Yosemite.\nLastly, the combination of the physical and the logical layers make the social layer possible. Even if the network and the software layers are air-gapped and highly secure, the social layer, the layer where people interact with the computing device, can still offer up vulnerabilities, as was illustrated in the Stuxnet incident. Knowing who is using a device and how they perceive and interact with the world around them can open up a variety of vulnerabilities including social engineering and phishing. The social layer is composed of both the actual people and personalities using the computing devices and the cyber persona of the individual using a platform.\nAggregating outward, the layers of cyberspace and their attributes in the vernacular of international relations constitute capabilities. Capabilities can be broadly defined as including mechanisms of offensive and defensive military strength such as size and number of offensive cyber units. Capabilities can include doctrinal measures or indicators such as official cyber security and warfare doctrines and can include the size and complexity of systems and their connections to other systems of importance. And capabilities can include technical capabilities such as programming skill within the environment.\nThe capabilities matrix included below is overly simplified, yet it indicates a host of areas where the intelligence community can provide significant assistance to decision-makers. What is important to consider is that these capabilities are not limited to the United States or its allies. Capabilities need to be assessed on a nation-by-nation basis and on a substate basis as well. These and many other unmentioned cyber capabilities combine to provide an accurate picture of the battlespace.\nIdentifying the capabilities and political situation of a new battlespace is difficult under the best of circumstances. Cyber is immensely complicated and therefore necessitates a logical template within which to examine capabilities. There is a need for a differentiation between the domestic (defensive) and the foreign (offensive) battlespace. This distinction is important both for tasking and decision-making. When the two battlespaces are separated, they are able to inform one another. Table 7.2 highlights many of the primary areas for consideration within the two battlespaces necessary for DBA and DBK.\nThe INTs above can and should be focused on these and related areas within the cyber domain. A holistic picture of the above components of the domain will\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER SEVEN\nTABLE 7.2 Components of Cyber DBA and DBK\n|  Domestic (Defense Oriented) | Foreign (Offense Oriented)  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  Policy considerations (offensive & defensive) | Policy considerations (offensive & defensive)  |\n|  Domestic network mapping | Foreign network mapping  |\n|  Budget allocations | Budget allocations  |\n|  ICT collaboration (alliances, partnerships) | Offensive unit size & training  |\n|  Defensive unit size & training | Defensive unit size & training  |\n|  Critical infrastructure | Critical infrastructure  |\n|  Insider threats for defensive purposes | Insider threats for offensive purposes  |\n|  Threat spectrum capabilities | Historical record of attack and defense  |\n|  Known vulnerabilities | Threat spectrum capabilities  |\n|  Time to attack recognition | Known vulnerabilities  |\n|  Time to attack attribution | ICT collaborations (alliances, partnerships)  |\n|  Systemic dependencies | Time to attack recognition  |\n|  Monitoring | Time to attack attribution  |\n|   | Systemic dependencies  |\n|   | Surveillance  |\n|   | Reconnaissance  |\nprovide decision-makers with a clearer visualization of the battlespace. Again, following Waltz, a visualization of any battlespace includes the following:\n\nEdward Amoroso argues the intelligence community should focus on creating an addition to the conventional intelligence briefs that consist solely of information pertaining to cyber.[31] Amoroso indicates such a report should focus on current security posture, top and new security risks, automated metrics, and human interpretation. Amoroso's case for the creation of a cyber-specific intelligence brief is sound and works toward promoting an accurate and realistic understanding of the threats and opportunities within this new and evolving domain relevant to national security.\n# POLICY CONSIDERATIONS\nThe Joint Chiefs of Staff have placed an increasing emphasis on the cyber domain within various joint doctrine publications. Joint doctrines provide insight into the needs of the services and policy-makers in the employment of and defense against cyber attacks. Documents also include many of the ways cyber\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nThe Role of Intelligence in Cyberspace [113]\nhas come to rely heavily on intelligence assets. Information superiority has become a mission critical aspect of defending national security. The Department of Defense's \"Joint Doctrine for Command and Control Warfare\" dating back to 1996 highlights the importance of intelligence products in support of C2W. The document indicates the use of intelligence assists in the conceptualization of all aspects of a battlespace.\nComprehension of any battlespace, including the cyber domain, requires understanding the policy environment in which an action occurs. Is there a national cyber defense strategy within the targeted country? How have they publicly or privately declared they would respond to hostile acts within the cyber domain? An example of the policy environment can be found in the \"Department of Defense Strategy for Operating in Cyberspace.\" The strategy outlines five strategic initiatives in its declassified report:\nStrategic Initiative 1: Treat cyberspace as an operational domain to organize, train, and equip so that DoD can take full advantage of cyberspace's potential\nStrategic Initiative 2: Employ new defense operating concepts to protect DoD networks and systems\nStrategic Initiative 3: Partner with other U.S. government departments and agencies and the private sector to enable a whole-of-government cyber security strategy\nStrategic Initiative 4: Build robust relationships with U.S. allies and international partners to strengthen collective cyber security\nStrategic Initiative 5: Leverage the nation's ingenuity through an exceptional cyber workforce and rapid technological innovation\nThe recently declassified sections of the report cited in the media indicate a doctrinal shift in the way the DoD approaches the cyber domain. The Wall Street Journal reports that DoD sources as early as 2011 indicated that some instances of cyber attacks can constitute an act of war.[32] This has further developed as recently as September 2014 with the NATO pledge for mutual defense in the event of significant cyber attacks that might result in the invocation of Article 5.[33] When asked what constitutes an act of war in cyberspace that would rise to a level that would result in the successful invocation of Article 5 for mutual defense, NATO secretary general Rasmussen said that the goal was to achieve \"strategic ambiguity\" to keep adversaries guessing and to act as \"ambiguous deterrence.\"[34]\nAlthough the current position on what constitutes an act of war in cyberspace within the eyes of the United States and NATO remains uncertain, understanding the policy positions within the domestic battlespace and in the foreign battlespace helps alleviate information asymmetries and establish clearly identifiable patterns for response. Whether it is the knowledge that Germany and the Netherlands both have official cyber security doctrines or that China has begun implementing a policy of making offensive cyber capabilities a strategic priority,\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER SEVEN\nthe overt and covert collection of policy positions provides policy-makers with a foundation for understanding intelligence related to cyber.\nPolicy platforms also help to codify international law, to create zones of norms or an identifiable policy framework in which states will interact or respond to incidents emanating from cyberspace.³⁵ While both the United States and Russia have made known a cyber attack could constitute an act of war, there has been little elaboration on specific characteristics of such an attack within the official policy-making circles of government. Often states will intentionally leave room for policy ambiguity as a mechanism of deterrence.³⁶ Understanding ambiguity, information gaps, and information asymmetry is crucial particularly in comprehending how leaders arrive at decisions. As in conventional warfare, in cyber conflict the minimization of or the knowledge about what a potential adversary will do in a given situation provides a strategic edge. Although there has been little in the form of codified policy delineation on what level of cyber attack would constitute an act of war, the academic community has been heavily engaged in attempting to apply existing legal frameworks to the cyber domain. The most notable work in this arena is the Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare, which works through in rigorous detail how actions within cyberspace could fall within existing international law.³⁷ Yet as rigorous as the work is, there is no single government required to adhere to its findings on the applicability of international law, and even within the laws themselves there was a significant amount of debate as to what constituted various levels of action in cyberspace. Instead of thinking of sponsored academic works such as the Tallinn Manual as clear policies to which states should adhere, they should be instead thought of as roadmaps to guide states in developing policies.\n# CE—NETWORK MAPPING, SYSTEMIC DEPENDENCIES, AND HISTORICAL RECORDS\nUnderstanding the policy environment both domestically and among foreign adversaries is only part of the larger intelligence process. Cyber exploitation (CE) constitutes a series of technological and analytical approaches to cyber-specific espionage. CE for the purposes of conventional intelligence collection can include the penetration of foreign networks to secure information on weapons systems, policy positions, and much more. CE is invasive yet does not disrupt, deny, or destroy data; it collects data. When CE operations focus intelligence on the cyber domain for offensive and defensive purposes, the objective is to understand the systems themselves. The goal becomes identifying the strengths and weaknesses of systems, the connectivity of systems to points of interests, and the interaction of those systems with strategic and tactical objectives.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nThe Role of Intelligence in Cyberspace [115]\nThere are numerous methods of CE; for the purposes of simplicity only a few are examined here. Network mapping is a form of CE that studies the physical connectivity of networks or the availability of insecure ports. This type of mapping provides information on what types of systems and servers operate on different networks and identifies the characteristics of the various component parts these systems constitute. Network mapping can drill down to very low levels on particular networks and provide significant information speed and types of hardware on various networks. This information can also be used to isolate portions of networks to identify potential heavy traffic users or other sources of potential exploitation.\nNetwork mapping is also useful for illustrating the potential for any particular targeted attack to extend beyond its intended target and result in collateral damage or blowback. Conceptually network mapping is not dissimilar from attempting to map radar or surface-to-air missile locations prior to a bombing campaign. The intent of network mapping is to gain an operational knowledge of an adversary's systems prior to engaging in an OCO.\nForensic analysis of the Stuxnet worm found the worm partially employed network mapping to target its attacks, focusing on isolated networks using memory sticks as the initial method of transmission.[38] Once in, Stuxnet focused its attack on networks with programmable logic controllers (PLCs) of a specific type and caused uranium enrichment centrifuges to malfunction.[39] The level of sophistication required to drill down to get to this level of detail to plan an attack is remarkable, particularly considering the complexity and number of overall systems and the air-gapped nature of the systems.\nNetwork mapping is both an offensive and defensive intelligence endeavor. To adequately prepare both the defensive and offensive battlespaces, an accurate picture of systems is needed. Arguably the dual domestic-foreign pictures are complementary and help avoid violating part 2.13 of Executive Order 12333, which prevents any covert action from influencing U.S. political processes, public opinion, policies, media, or various sections of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.[40]\nNetwork mapping and monitoring is a double-edged sword. Legally network mapping can be considered CE, and therefore domestic network mapping by U.S. intelligence agencies without a warrant would be prohibited. However, network mapping is of critical importance to the maintenance of national security infrastructures. Thus far the intelligence community does not have a formal commitment from the White House or the Justice Department to engage in any domestic CE operations.[41] Currently in the United States there is an uneasy and inefficient public-private commitment to providing information on network security across critical infrastructure. A thorough understanding of domestic and foreign networks assists in visualization for both offensive and defensive\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER SEVEN\npurposes, and effort to push reasoned analysis of threats has begun to make its way into Congress.⁴²\nNetwork mapping assists in the identification of network components. Once network components are known, it becomes necessary to explore vulnerabilities within systems. Most damaging are zero-day vulnerabilities, which are vulnerabilities in computer applications of which even system administrators are unaware. The Stuxnet attack exposed several zero-day vulnerabilities in the Windows software controlling/monitoring the programmable logic controllers, causing the attached centrifuges to spin outside of their safe operational standards.\nSystemic vulnerabilities necessitate a thorough understanding of the historical record of different types of attacks and exploits. The identification of zero-day vulnerabilities should lead network administrators to immediately patch these gaps. Intelligence plays a role in identifying what types of attacks have been used in the past and what vulnerabilities these attacks attempted to exploit. Historical accounting is important for both offensive and defensive preparation of the battlespace. For obvious reasons it is important to prevent repeat attacks on domestic systems; at the same time it is important not to engage in repeat attack methods once a vulnerability on an opposing system has been fixed. Such an attack would likely be ineffective and lead to anonymity-attribution problems.\nThe historical accounting of attack types by countries and substate actors also alerts operators within the intelligence and military community to the threat spectrum capabilities of a particular cyber adversary. Understanding the threat spectrum capabilities of states facilitates an accurate conceptualization of their power to operate within the domain. Table 7.3 is a representation of known threat spectrum capabilities.\nThe above areas of consideration within CE are only a small sampling of the overall tasking priorities for intelligence using CE methods. They hint at a broad applicability for CYBERINT methods in the preparation of the battlespace.\n# CONVENTIONAL INTELLIGENCE\nIntelligence collected on budgetary allocations, offensive and defensive cyber unit sizes, and training methodologies provides the clearest parallel to conventional intelligence. As in conventional intelligence, most countries are frequently unwilling to release data on absolute military expenditures or the sizes and force structures within their military. Military capabilities are a closely guarded secret in most countries. Capabilities are particularly secretive in the cyber domain. Often if cyber capabilities are exposed, they cease to be capabilities.⁴³ Once Stuxnet was discovered by the Iranians, defensive measures were taken to \"plug\" the holes the Stuxnet attack employed. This dramatically reduces\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nTABLE 7.3 Cyber Threat Spectrum\n|  Levels (Types) of Attack | Description | Feasibility | Complexity  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  Propaganda | The propagation of information via the Internet to affect public, private, or governmental opinion.

Whereas missiles can be launched with repeated success because the ability to defend against a moving projectile is difficult, a similar cyber weapon is more easily defended against once it has been identified. Antivirus software can be reprogrammed to identify and isolate repeat threats, and zero-day vulnerabilities can be patched.\nAn excellent example of an open source analysis of cyber capabilities comes from Stokes, Lin, and Hsiao, who examine in explicit detail the construction, location, leadership, and mission of many aspects of the Chinese People's Liberation Army information warfare programs.⁴⁴ Their report is an example of a high-value detailed analysis that could be supplemented by conventional intelligence to enhance policy-maker and combatant commander comprehension of the battlespace. The detailed analysis of the location and force structure can cause an enemy to shift its tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and make them less reliable. Alternatively, not revealing that information has been gained on TTPs can provide an offensive edge in cyber operations.\nThe implications for conventional intelligence collection methods indicate that intelligence on cyber does not necessarily need to remain cyberbound or exclusively within the realm of CE. Many metrics such as force size matter in cyber and can be examined to create a better assessment of potential adversaries. Cyber force size is particularly important from a malware development perspective. Complex coding scripts typically necessitate large numbers of programmers to develop and test the scripts. The ability for an individual to accomplish highly complex attacks is possible but less likely than a large cyber warfare unit working with the same objective.\nLikewise, knowing where a unit is located or how programmers were trained can help planners determine the best response to a particular attack, or how best to manipulate their organizational structure. Derek Clark and Kai Konrad refer to this as identifying the weakest link.⁴⁵ The identification of the weakest link is particularly important in cyber defense and offense. There are multiple fronts (systems) needing defense. All it takes is one \"best shot\" to achieve significant damage. While this weakest link can be identified through CE operations outlined in the previous section, it can also be identified within the training, command, and organizational structure of units charged with conducting or protecting against cyber attacks.\nClosely related to the conventional military metrics above, yet likely unique to the cyber domain, are public-private ICT collaborations. Although most countries have programs for military public and private collaborations with universities and businesses for research and development, within the cyber domain the importance of this relationship is magnified for multiple reasons. First, much of the training and education necessary to conduct offensive or defensive oper\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nThe Role of Intelligence in Cyberspace [119]\nations within cyberspace can be learned at public institutions or can be crafted for private sector use. This extends far beyond the development of technology to the actual training of the warfighter, the development of the platforms upon which the domain rests, and more. Second, these collaborations spread out but do not diffuse potential vulnerabilities.\nBecause collaborations can form the foundational aspects of the cyber warriors within offensive and defensive units, they can train, equip, and prepare in ways far different from conventional military means. Most countries have a balance between civilian and military protection of their national cyber infrastructures based largely on the development of computer emergency response teams (CERTs). An intelligence assessment of the strength and quality of ICT collaborations is of critical importance in understanding the cyber battlespace.\nICT collaborations are not necessarily official and do not need to be highly structured and regimented. Alexander Klimburg provides evidence Russia and China have created groups of plausibly deniable cyber attackers.[46] Creating an accurate open source measure of unofficial collaborations is difficult. An intelligence focus on unofficial collaborations with entities can contextualize cyber incidents such as the 2007 cyber attacks directed at Estonian governmental, bank, and communications websites.[47] The attacks were motivated by a decision to move a Russian war memorial from central Tallinn. While initial reports indicated Russia was the culprit, Russia denied any participation in the cyber attacks.[48] The reality is somewhat murkier and more akin to an unofficial sanction or condoning of cyber attacks by the Russian government.[49]\nThe collection and production of intelligence on more conventional attributes of pertinence to the cyber domain is a role in which the intelligence community is likely already engaged. Occasionally reports on issues relating to this category of intelligence are published for public consumption. A recent report of this type was produced for the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission to examine China's capability to conduct cyber warfare and cyber exploitation.[50] Knowledge of capabilities is still applicable to the cyber domain and is greatly influenced by conventional intelligence collection methods and subsequent analysis, which contextualizes the meaning of raw intelligence.\n## HUMINT AND CYBER\nHuman intelligence (HUMINT) stands out in cyber for two particular reasons. First, HUMINT agents can provide accurate internal information on systems and access to those systems unavailable through CE and other intelligence collection methods. Second, human assets can serve as a bridge between the external world and air-gapped or other forms of secure networks. As was indicated above, it is likely that the Stuxnet virus was distributed using a thumb drive,\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER SEVEN\nwhich needed to be inserted into a machine within an air-gapped network. HUMINT agents can serve as a vulnerability against which most network administrators will be unable to provide significant protection.\nThe role of a HUMINT asset with access to information on networks can be extremely damaging. Even if the agent is on a lightly classified network, the repercussions of his or her actions can be enormous. The scandal caused by Bradley Manning (now named Chelsea Manning) leaking more than 260,000 diplomatic cables to WikiLeaks in 2010 is illustrative of the problem posed by internal threats.⁵¹ Manning’s leak and the even more damaging 2013 document releases by Edward Snowden, a former employee of a contractor affiliated with both the NSA and CIA, highlight the potential damage a rogue employee can have on the ability of the intelligence community to keep information secret.⁵² Snowden’s insider collection and subsequent release of documents pertaining to the National Security Agency likely constitutes one of the most significant intelligence leaks of all time and resulted in an estimated 1.7 million documents being released in violation of U.S. classification law.⁵³ Moreover, unlike the leaks by Manning, the Snowden leaks revealed many of the TTPs used by the NSA in its intelligence operations in the cyber domain. These revelations have been extremely damaging and have resulted in changes in the way adversaries safeguard their cyber infrastructure.\nHUMINT threats need to be developed and enhanced for offensive intelligence and protected against for domestic national security counterintelligence. Gaining access to the technical schematics, documents, information, login procedures, or any of a multitude of other targets of intelligence a HUMINT asset could provide is a critical aspect added directly by intelligence to the understanding of the cyber domain. Furthermore, HUMINT agents are almost impossible to detect under normal circumstances as they can often engage in significant espionage while still easily performing the normal duties. Unlike the spy thriller days of old when agents had to sneak out of a building with classified documents in a folder or a box, they can often place thousands or millions of documents on a solid-state drive and easily conceal it upon exiting a facility. Many of these drives are smaller in size than a penny.\nBeyond the collection of intelligence from HUMINT sources, these insiders can assist in the implementation of cyber actions. Information within a 2005 report by the U.S. Secret Service in cooperation with Carnegie Mellon indicated that up to 29 percent of all attacks against a surveyed group of critical infrastructure stakeholders were initiated by insiders.⁵⁴ The majority of motivations behind these attacks were not related to intelligence or covert action. This, however, does not preclude the possibility of using insiders to affect or gain information or access on adversary systems. The recruitment and maintenance of insider threats by the intelligence community should be a top priority.

All of the intelligence collection methods and the focus of the intel process of trying to comprehend the cyber domain culminate in understanding, from a mission critical orientation, the progression of cyber attacks. Figure 7.1 is a simplified model for understanding attack planning and progression within a battlespace modeled loosely on the JP 3-51 electronic warfare-planning model.[55] This model is informed by intelligence collection. Line one of the figure indicates a policy-maker's perspective on the process of engaging in conflict. A conflict initiation is (o) planned, (1) implemented, and (2) completed. Policy-makers want to know what resources any given action will take and how long it will take to complete it. In cyber a more accurate timeline for action in cyberspace requires (o) intelligence collection, (1) operational planning of the attack with an informed knowledge of the battlespace, (2) understanding of the time it takes for the attack to be completed, (3) how long until the attack is recognized as an attack by the adversary, (4) how long until that adversary can do something about the attack, (5) how long until the adversary assigns attribution for the attack. The ordering of the items listed above greatly affects the ability for an attack to be conducted successfully. Intelligence informs the policy-maker and commander as to the feasibility of a particular type of attack and the probability of success. If recognition of an attack occurs early in the timeline of events the probability of success is diminished.\nThe timeline can be tested in much the same way conventional weapons are tested. It would be absurd to send a bomber over a potential target with a completely untested bomb, or to send a soldier into battle with an untested model of rifle. Just as weapons are tested in the physical world, they need to be tested in the cyber domain as well. This testing provides added information to both\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER SEVEN\nFIGURE 7.2 The Influence of Intelligence on Cyber Operations\nModified from E. Waltz, Information Warfare.\nthe policy-maker and the combatant commander as to the effectiveness of the weapon and the timeline of events above. If a cyber weapon is slow and easily detectable, its probability for success is diminished. This lowered probability for success does not nullify its use but does condition it.\nOne aspect of this phase of IPB is that it is extremely beneficial to both the offensive and defensive strategic and tactical operations. By planning and testing potential attacks against theoretical adversarial systems, the intelligence community provides an out-of-the-box perspective necessary to prevent similar attacks against domestic targets. This logic would indicate an attempt to use a worm like Stuxnet against the U.S. infrastructure would run into greater problems than if the weapon had been developed first elsewhere.\n# IPB AND ITS IMPACT ON CYBER\nThe role of intelligence in cyber is not dissimilar from its role in the conventional domains. There are new areas in which collection and analysis need to occur, yet its overall objective remains the same. Returning to Edward Waltz's concept of information preparation of the battlefield, figure 7.2 illustrates intelligence's influence on operations originating within the cyber domain. The role of intelligence in cyber is to accurately facilitate an understanding of those\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nThe Role of Intelligence in Cyberspace [123]\nentities and the possible tools by which to influence them. The cyber domain is surrounded with hype and hysteria. Many of the claims are accurately based in reality. But the known unknowns are still enormous within this evolving domain, and it is incumbent on intelligence to provide an accurate assessment of the current state of affairs.\nAll-source intelligence for cyber operations requires the intelligence community to think beyond domestic system defense. The focus should be balanced between foreign and domestic intelligence, thereby mutually informing one another and creating a systemic defense for national assets in addition to better facilitating decision-makers with a more accurate picture of how a potential cyber attack might succeed or fail.\n# CYBER AS COVERT ACTION\nTo further define the role of intelligence in cyber, it is necessary to look more deeply into the laws codifying the conduct of the intelligence community. All of the above sections provide a framework for defining the role of intelligence with regard to IPB. Cyber conflict is, by its very nature, covert. Even if an attack is discovered, it is often unattributable. Attacks can be designed to go unnoticed and affect changes to systems and their components for days, weeks, or months without detection. Even in instances where groups such as Anonymous publically take credit for attacks, responsibility is typically claimed post hoc. Nearly all examples of state-on-state cyber attacks have been covert.\nThe covert nature of cyber brings full circle Warner's definition of intelligence as attempting to influence. Covert action is a secret operation to influence a foreign entity. At least in theory, most, if not all, cyber attacks begin covertly. Section 1.7(a)(4) of Executive Order 12333 regarding intelligence activities describes covert action:\nConduct convert action activities approved by the President. No agency except the Central Intelligence Agency (or the Armed Forces of the United States in time of war declared by the Congress or during any period covered by a report from the President to the Congress consistent with the War Powers Resolution, Public Law 93-148) may conduct any covert action activity unless the President determines that another agency is more likely to achieve a particular objective.[56]\nEvident in the early structuring of the governmental approach to cyberspace is the categorization of cyber operations as covert actions. The Department of Defense originally took the lead with General Keith Alexander as the head of both NSA and Cyber Command, a path that has continued now that Admiral Michael Rogers has taken over as the head of both organizations. This indicates the president has established an agency other than the Central Intelligence\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER SEVEN\nAgency as the primary covert operator within this domain. While the logic behind having a military intelligence organization commander and an organizational structure that falls under the U.S. Strategic Command (STRATCOM) runs counter to EO 12333, the institutional capacity of the DoD in the technical domain and the scale of the problem being faced within this new domain make the assignment appropriate.\n# SUMMARIZING THE ROLE OF INTELLIGENCE WITHIN THE CYBER DOMAIN\nIn defining the role of intelligence within the cyber domain, it is necessary to take a holistic approach. From a collection perspective, the intelligence community should be and has been working in coordination with a hybrid push-and-pull intelligence cycle to both elevate the importance of this domain and facilitate collection within it. The emphasis has been heavily defensive up to this point and largely focused on countering threats rather than anticipating them. This needs to change, and the only way this can change is if the intelligence community begins to actively turn its sights on adversaries and develop more rigorous all-source intelligence combining novel CYBERINT technologies to augment reporting on this domain. Parroting Amoroso's assertion, cyber should be included on the daily intelligence briefs of policy-makers. The inclusion would likely start the process of demystification of this immensely complicated domain.\nCyberspace is a domain that can be used to fulfill all aspects of Warner's definition of intelligence to some degree. It is a domain in which it is possible to gain understanding about other states beyond and within the domain itself, but it is also a domain that can influence other states' policy decisions as well as perceptions. In particular, accurate intelligence on both sides of the domestic-foreign divide can mutually inform decision-makers about vulnerabilities and the eventual decision to use cyber as an offensive weapon or how best to defend against attacks. Moreover, intelligence can rein in the debate on cyber to a more realistic area of operations predicated on sound estimates rather than on grandiose speculation.\nThe intelligence community itself commonly is the point of origin for OCOs emanating from the cyber domain and will likely serve as a force multiplier in instances where a combined conventional cyber attack is necessary. To engage in cyber conflict, just as in conventional conflict, intelligence is needed to prepare the battlespace and facilitate an accurate assessment of the probability for success and utility for any type of operation. This preparation hones the weapons, decisions, and effect of a potential operation. More importantly for national security, a thorough and accurate preparation of both the foreign and domestic battlespaces will serve to inform and enhance cyber security.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms",

Intelligence is increasingly facilitating information superiority through an understanding of the cyber domain. The Department of Defense's \"Joint Vision 2020\" establishes the goal of information superiority on the battlefield. This information superiority enables decision superiority and favorably tilts the strategic and tactical balance. Information superiority is built on cyber power, scale and complexity of attacks, robustness of defense, policy positions, systemic vulnerabilities and dependencies, and actor anonymity and attribution issues. Intelligence plays a mission critical role in assessing these characteristics. The discussion below examines the role of intelligence in identifying these characteristics within the cyber domain and examines how it influences the decision-making of policy-makers. Specifically the focus hones in on how intelligence increases the effectiveness of identifying potential attackers within the cyber domain and informs the decision-making of policy-makers when engaging in covert cyber action directed against a potential adversary. The discussion is designed to serve as a strategic framework in which to understand the role of intelligence within the cyber domain.\nIs it really necessary to examine the role of intelligence within the cyber domain as contextually different than in a conventional domain? The short answer is yes. Cyber necessitates independent examination because it is characteristically different, and yet at the same time it is a pervasive feature affecting outcomes within other domains. What differentiates cyber from land, sea, air, and space are three fundamental attributes relevant to intelligence practitioners. First, the cyber domain is a man-made domain. Second, military capabilities across the other domains are managed through the cyber domain. Third, military and civilian aspects of the cyber domain are often intertwined and difficult to differentiate. These attributes pose unique opportunities and problems for intelligence officials.\nThe man-made nature of the cyber domain makes it a largely virtual domain with its value corresponding to the speed and volume of information contained\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER SEVEN\nwithin it. However, the cyber domain is not entirely virtual and has numerous real-world connection points to everything from industrial control systems of power and water management facilities to the weapon systems of drones flying above distant battlefields.\nCyberspace is not tangible in the same way as more conventional domains and therefore necessitates a new form of dynamic intelligence evolving from all-source collection of conventional and novel intelligence sources. A recent National Research Council report states that intelligence in the cyber domain is useful for both strategic and tactical purposes.¹ The strategic and tactical importance of intelligence's role in influencing the cyber domain falls within the concept of all-source intelligence. Loch Johnson defines all-source intelligence as one of the fundamental propositions of a theory of strategic intelligence.² More importantly for the purposes of understanding the operational and political environments within which offensive and defensive actions in cyberspace can occur, it is necessary to understand what intelligence is within decisions regarding the cyber domain and how intelligence influences those decisions.\n## DEFINING INTELLIGENCE\nThere are dozens of different definitions of intelligence, each of which is in some way applicable to understanding cyber action. One of the more succinct and conceptually ordered comes from Michael Warner, who defines intelligence as a \"secret, state activity to understand or influence foreign entities.\"³ His definition establishes the fundamental premises of both collection and analysis, while including actions designed to influence. Intelligence is vital to the cyber domain because foreign entities are increasingly storing, managing, and directing their governmental, public, private, and military functions in a digitized world.\nThe traditional intelligence collection types (INTs) are still of immense value, yet they must be combined with aspects of the digitized target spectrum to provide a holistic view of both threats and opportunities. At present the majority of studies in the public domain have focused on defense.⁴ This defensive posture is made clear by General Keith Alexander, the director of the National Security Agency and commander of United States Cyber Command, when he writes: \"US Cyber Command's efforts and planning aim to ensure that the DoD has done all it can to defend and deter determined adversaries, mitigate dangerous threats, and address nagging vulnerabilities, so that even our most capable opponents will know that interfering with our nation's equities in cyberspace is a losing proposition.\"⁵\nThis defensive and deterrent-reliant posture is limiting and prone to inadequacies. Echoing Machiavelli and to some extent Sun Tzu, the adage \"the best defense is a good offense\" offers a novel way of considering action and intelli\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nThe Role of Intelligence in Cyberspace [103]\ngence within cyber. More accurately, it allows for a systematic approach to both national cyber defensive and offensive resource allocations. Beyond the efficiency argument for shifting the focus from solely defense to a balance between defense and offense, intelligence collection can help to inform offensive strategies and the decision to use cyber as a weapon. The role of intelligence within cyber becomes increasingly important when considering the difficulty of achieving any significant measure of deterrence within the cyber domain.⁶\nThe defensive orientation of the majority of cyber literature has a constraining effect on decision-making processes for the use of offensive cyber weapons. This defensive focus is largely due to both the alarmist calls of some scholars and policy-makers and an information communications technologies industry orientation offering many more strategies for defense than for offense. While I do not dispute the need for defense, this defensive focus leads the national security establishment down a path of attempting to create an impenetrable system. If there is one thing that is abundantly clear in the cyber domain it is that the only impenetrable system is the one that has not been made. Cyber is based on physics and algorithms. The mathematics and science behind security measures can be immensely complex and take massive computing power to penetrate, but that does not make them impenetrable. Even the most robust systems secured with checks and encryptions are still highly vulnerable to their users' ignorance or malice, as was the case with Edward Snowden in 2013.\nInstead of focusing on a solely carte blanche defensive posture toward cyber security, intelligence can provide both an offensive and defensive picture more effective at safeguarding national security. Taking a step back from the conventional cyber security literature, intelligence can direct cyber security efforts to not merely safeguard national security but also provide an offensive tool for use against other states. The vast literature on intelligence, ranging from the way intelligence influences the policy-making process to how it helps to understand aspects of the development of utility for actions, serves as a guide in defining the role of intelligence within the cyber domain.\nReflecting on Warner's definition of intelligence, the spectrum of intelligence collection methods—from human intelligence (HUMINT) to the more technical collection methods of signals intelligence (SIGINT), measurement and signatures intelligence (MASINT), geospatial intelligence (GEOINT), and open source intelligence (OSINT)—works together in an all-source environment to provide an accurate understanding of foreign entities. (Table 7.1 provides a quick definitional reference for the various intelligence collection types.) The understanding provided by intelligence has largely focused on the conventional domains and on political decision-making. However, as decisions in conventional domains increasingly migrate toward cyberspace, and the systems controlling the tools used in these domains increasingly become digitally connected, the\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER SEVEN\nTABLE 7.1 Intelligence Collection Methods\n|  Intelligence Source Type | Definition  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  Open Source (OSINT) | Overtly available information found, selected, and acquired from publicly available source.  |\n|  Measurement and Signatures (MASINT) | Intelligence detected and classified from targets that identify or describe signatures (distinctive characteristics) of fixed or dynamic target sources.  |\n|  Human (HUMINT) | Intelligence collected through interpersonal contact via human collection officers.  |\n|  Geospatial (GEOINT)* | The exploitation and analysis of imagery and geospatial information to describe, assess, and visually depict physical features and geographically referenced activities on the earth.

Williams, Shimeal, and Dunlevy, \"Intelligence Analysis for Internet Security.\" CYBERINT is considered independent of traditional SIGINT. However, as in many of the other types of intelligence collection, techniques and agencies often overlap.\nimportance of understanding the technical schematics and decision processes becomes vital to national security.\nNick Cullather, in an article on digital connections on the battlefield, indicates significant advances in the development of network-centric warfare. Cullather notes that the rise of a \"revolution in military affairs\" has largely not been matched by the intelligence community's ability to keep up.[7] This is of particular importance when looking beyond the network-centric battlefield of conventional weapons to the new zone of confrontation within cyberspace itself. Similarly, Michael Herman finds that counterterrorism intelligence analysis requires a broad spectrum of information sources brought together.[8] ICT facilitates the mitigation of \"stovepipes\" and increases the efficiency in information transference.[9] Information transmission has also been facilitated following the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 by the creation of \"fusion centers.\"[10] ICT has a role to play not only in the conduct of war on the battlefield, but also in the management of a conventional traditional threat spectrum within the fusion centers and beyond in the wider intelligence community.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nThe Role of Intelligence in Cyberspace [105]\nTerrorism is not commonly regarded as part of the conventional threat spectrum, yet in reality most terrorist acts take place in the physical world and require bombs and guns. However, the information coordination necessary to organize, plan, and conduct warfare, terrorist acts, and political strategies has largely shifted to cyberspace. The 2008 Mumbai terrorist attacks are a poignant example of terrorists leveraging technology and open source intelligence collected from public sites and software such as Google Earth to plan and orchestrate mass murder.[11] As horrific as the use of digital tools for planning attacks is, it is not isolated to open source intelligence collection via tools. Terrorists also use open source cryptography and crypto-currencies to finance their operations.[12] Intelligence agencies are in a competition with other states and organizations to leverage tools effectively to prevent attacks by terrorists and to mitigate international incidents before they arise.\nWhile open source research is fundamentally more powerful than ever before, available open source information provides only a limited aperture to realistically size up threats and targets within cyberspace itself. The problem of intelligence in cyberspace is massive both in terms of scale and complexity of data. Joel Brenner, a former inspector general of the National Security Agency and head of U.S. counterintelligence, indicated there has been an enormous threat emanating from within cyberspace that is not being adequately addressed.[13]\nModern warfare, command and control warfare (C2W), is network centric. Large swaths of the national critical infrastructures in states that pose conventional security and economic threats to the United States are controlled by digital systems. The literature is less focused on the need for understanding these vulnerabilities than it is on safeguarding them. The defensive focus, to a large degree, overshadows the development of offensive capabilities.\nPhil Williams, Timothy Shimeal, and Casey Dunlevy make a well-reasoned case arguing for focused intelligence efforts on identifying threats to national cyber security.[14] These authors make a valid point that needs to be addressed and is being addressed by several national strategy documents on the topic, including the National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace and the \"International Strategy for Cyberspace.\" One report of particular importance addressing many of the issues brought up by Williams, Shimeal, and Dunlevy is the October 2011 report by the Office of the National Counterintelligence Executive on cyber espionage.[15] A broad spectrum of federal strategies and reports has made identification and protection against vulnerabilities a top priority. More recently the president of the United States under Executive Order 13636 in February 2013 directed the government to begin actively seeking out and planning strategies to mitigate cyber threats to national critical infrastructure.\nThis is a process that is under way and includes an alphabet soup of agencies from across the civilian and military spectrum of the government. A re\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER SEVEN\ncurrent problem that keeps cropping up in many of the discussions on critical infrastructure is network awareness. Many companies and firms affiliated with critical infrastructure do not have an adequate understanding of their own vulnerabilities, let alone how they interact to create systemic threats. One industry based on personal communications and working experience that seems to be working very hard to address these issues is the U.S. financial sector, which in many ways is pioneering cyber security efforts under E.O. 13636.\nCurrently most cyber security is based on attacks or incidents in progress or that have already occurred. It is difficult, if not impossible, to defend against an unknown attack. Much of the effort in the United States cyber community now seems to be equivalent to plugging the holes in the dike after it floods. It is a fact that most cyber attacks are repeat attacks originating at the lower end of the threat spectrum, making the strategy of filling holes in the dike an absolute necessity in an effort to prevent repeat intrusions from identical or similar malware types. Yet this post hoc strategy largely fails to address the more serious problem of accurately anticipating what the next type of attack is going to be. This strategy, best referred to as a \"Maginot Line\" strategy, is prone to failure in areas where technological and strategic capabilities rapidly evolve. The real challenge is to develop intelligence-based approaches to cyberspace that prevent future attacks before they happen.\nThere is a significant and sustained effort underway on the defensive side of the cyber debate within the DoD to develop better security. The DoD is currently employing at least three categories of defensive teams to facilitate DoD network protection: DoD information network operations teams (DoDIN Ops), defensive cyber operations—internal defensive measures teams (DCO-IDM or cyber protection teams), and defensive cyber operations—response action teams (DCO-RA or national mission teams).[16] Yet all of these teams are heavily reliant on intelligence on the cyber environment for defense (ICE-D). The teams that fit into these categories are tasked with segments of the overall problem. While the DoDIN-Ops teams are tasked with ensuring sustained secure operations on DoD networks, they are not focused on adversary behaviors in those networks. Their work is informed by adversary behaviors but seeks to maintain network security in aggregate. DCO-IDM or cyber protection teams function as hunter killers within the network. They are tasked with seeking out individuals engaging DoD networks illegally and stopping the attacks or exploits. DCO-RA or national mission teams are tasked with responding to adversary behavior in DoD networks. As should be readily apparent, the problem is enormous and relies on intelligence for all aspects of ICE-D functions. The DoD network environment alone is composed of millions of computing devices and users.\nBecause we exist in a world of known unknowns and unknown unknowns, to paraphrase Secretary Rumsfeld, cyber security is likely the former rather than\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nThe Role of Intelligence in Cyberspace [107]\nthe latter.¹⁷ How can intelligence be used to improve the cyber security situation not only to protect the national infrastructure in a more systematic and logical manner but also to use this information to inform the decision-making processes of policy-makers?\nOne problem associated with the U.S. cyber community is proximity. Because the community develops, tests, and employs its own tools, it is unable to take into account methods of testing that have not yet threatened systems in the past. This is an in-the-box, out-of-the-box, forget-the-box problem. The designers of systems, software, and networks are talented and smart individuals; they lead the world in technical innovation, yet because they are inside their own systems, it becomes it intrinsically difficult to isolate unforeseen problems. United States Cyber Command and various other teams from the services and the various academies have tried to address this problem by creating competitive cyber teams that compete with one other and against civilian competitors in various challenges such as DefCon capture the flag contests and others. These various DCO and DoDIN-Ops teams also engage one another to consistently foster novel thinking on security.\nYet the challenge is immense, and solutions are best achieved by constant introspection. Below are several proposed strategies to help facilitate the development of improved defensive operations. First, the current orientation toward plugging holes must continue. While this post hoc process is frustrating, it prevents or at least slows further intrusions. The mentality of these DoDIN-Ops is one of defense. The objective is to secure and defend systems against all possible or known types of attacks. The most realistic approach is to defend against known types of attacks. The systems become fortified against repeat incidents or at least can minimize their severity. The work of these teams is not sexy; it is not offense oriented; it is a process of continuous network security development. Second, DCO-IDM teams must also actively hunt in government and defense networks for potential adversaries and leverage information gained through all source intelligence collection and communication with DoDIN-Ops, DCO-RA, and OCO teams to anticipate potential blind spots. These teams must also be regularly rotated to provide them time to think like attackers. Third, DCO-RA teams must leverage all-source intelligence and continuous communications with DCO-IDM and OCO teams to engage adversaries in a defensive posture on foreign networks before they endanger DoD networks. While these teams are in the process of getting organized and established, it is important that these teams have clear interteam communications to mitigate stovepiping. The co-location or consistent rotation of team members would likely facilitate enhanced operational results. The co-location and coordination of members within a team should be of paramount importance as it allows analysts and technicians the opportunity to collaborate and developed a detailed and synergistic understanding of capabilities.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER SEVEN\nThe wider intelligence community must use all-source methods to collect as much intelligence on potential opponents as possible. This means profiling every aspect of other nations' cyber offensive and defensive capabilities. This requires a robust all-source collection methodology. Signals intelligence must look for transmissions and communications as well as spikes in Internet traffic and geo-locate them using IP addresses. These geo-located IP addresses need to be analyzed using satellites and drones to provide accurate geospatial information on the areas in question. Open source intelligence collection should attempt to gain as much publicly available information as possible on areas of interest through legal means. Once all of this information has been compiled and assessed, targeted HUMINT operations should begin working on developing assets within these areas or with connections to these areas. These agents should be recruited for multiple purposes. First, they should be used to secure intelligence on the capabilities of potential adversaries. These capabilities are defined in more detail below. Second, agents should also be recruited to become potential insider threats, a tool of particular importance on air-gapped systems.[18] Third, intelligence agencies should also place an emphasis on cyber exploitation (CE) and attempt to probe and map out network infrastructures, vulnerabilities, and strengths of adversaries. The last point is of importance both from an offensive and defensive strategic orientation.\nAnother major problem with the cyber domain arises out of its systemic complexity. As Williams, Shimeal, and Dunlevy accurately note, cyber defenders often do not have a realistic or accurate picture of their own systems, let alone the systems of adversaries who are attacking them.[19] Following their recommendations, the national security community would be prudent to make use of the principle of knowing yourself. This requires a consistent focus on domestic systems. However, only focusing on domestic systems leads to the \"Maginot Line\" tendency in which it is assumed networks are created to be impenetrable.\n# INTELLIGENCE AND THE CYBER BATTLESPACE\nThe cyber domain is a modern battlespace and necessitates a holistic understanding. To defend against or engage in offensive actions, it is necessary to have an accurate understanding of the operational environment. According to Edward Waltz, any battlespace, whether offensive or defensive, requires a combination of dominant battlespace awareness (DBA) and dominant battlespace knowledge (DBK).[20] The process of identifying what is and is not important to understanding a particular battlespace largely falls to the discretion of policy-makers within the intelligence cycle.\nIn writing about intelligence and decision-making, Stephen Marrin states: \"the intelligence cycle starts with decision-maker information requirements lev\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nThe Role of Intelligence in Cyberspace [109]\nied on intelligence collection capabilities, the processing of collected raw intelligence and transmission of this processed material to analysts who decipher its meaning, and relay that understanding back to the decision-makers.”²¹\nThe decision-maker engages in tasking through a number of different “pull” mechanisms including governmental reports, hearings before Congress, presidential directives, and executive orders. These tasking methods and others combine to facilitate within the intelligence community an accurate understanding of what constitutes the battlespace in the eyes of the policy-maker. Often the planning and direction can be informal requests from the executive or from Congress, and at other times it can come from official strategy documents.\nPrior to 9/11, terrorism was a priority, but the planning and direction of resources had not yet reached a critical mass sufficient to prevent the terrible attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Marrin and others find the intelligence process frequently fails to adequately define what constitutes a tasking priority for the intelligence community, necessitating a “push” from within the community outward. There are many instances in which policy-makers ignore, misinterpret, or misuse intelligence despite adequate tasking and intelligence production and dissemination.²²\nThe push mechanism of the intelligence community can happen in several ways. Often it can follow what constructivists call “norm entrepreneurs.” Entrepreneurs in the cyber domain include Richard Clarke, or John Arquilla and David Ronfeldt, among others.²³ These individuals bring to national policymakers’ attention issues of importance and help direct the intelligence community’s efforts. If, however, they make outlandish claims and statements, their push for new norms can have a backlash and inspire counter-entrepreneurs such as Thomas Rid, who writes that cyber war does not and will not occur.²⁴ Most traditional intelligence push comes from within the intelligence community itself.²⁵ Because the intelligence community is pushing intelligence not requested by the decision-makers, the concept of the intelligence cycle can, as Marrin notes, become linear.²⁶\nBecause the domain is so complex, it is beneficial for the president and policy-makers to have individuals with the requisite understanding of the domain not only in policy and legal terms but also in technical terms. The position currently established is known as the cyber czar. While this position is typically filled by someone with policy or legal expertise, it is beneficial for that individual to have a wide background and a reasonable technical understanding so he or she can facilitate complex discussions. Former cyber czar Melissa Hathaway would be a prime example of the type of individual who could accurately convey the complexity of the technical and historical attributes of interactions in the domain while at the same time have a firm grasp on the policy and legal implications of future actions. This person then sits at the choke point of the\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER SEVEN\npush and pull on the cyber domain and distills the information into a balanced reality applicable for decision-makers.\nFor intelligence to adequately focus its sights on any battlespace, planning and direction from policy-makers must occur. Once policy-makers have established the importance of a battlespace, the intelligence community must find ways to deliver accurate and reliable intelligence. The objective of intelligence collection is not solely to provide real-time information on the battlespace; rather, it is best thought of as battlespace preparation or what Waltz refers to as \"intelligence preparation of the battlespace\" (IPB).[27] Although Waltz specifically refers to IPB in the context of coordinated conventional warfare and the use of information operations in network-centric warfare, the theoretical principles apply across all domains. IPB, according to Waltz, includes providing an understanding of the \"physical, political, electronic, cyber, and other dimensions of the battlespace.\"[28] Alan D. Campen and Douglas H. Dearth reiterate the concept of IPB in Cyberwar 3.0. They state that information warfare requires an accurate knowledge of the battlespace as well as real-time awareness of situations within the battlespace as they arise.\nBefore moving directly into how each collection type can add to a holistic picture of the battlespace, it is necessary to define what constitutes the battlespace in the cyber domain. The battlespace, according to Waltz, constitutes \"all decision-relevant elements within a defined battlespace, and the ability to predict with very high confidence near-term enemy actions and outcomes.\"[29] More specifically this requires an understanding of human, material, and technical capabilities and the relationship of these capabilities within themselves and to other aspects of the operational environment. It is also important to understand the political implications of alterations in capabilities and the environment over time. A battlespace for cyber can be domestic or foreign and is considered to constitute three basic layers: physical, logical, and social layers. Intelligence must inform policy-makers on all three categories.\nThe physical layer is composed of a geographical location and the physical devices that constitute the environment. These devices can include hardware such as computers, switches, and routers. The devices that compose the physical layer can also include computing devices such as mobile phones, cars, airplanes, and ships. The physical layer also includes those devices used to facilitate cyber actions such as transoceanic cables, power stations, and buildings. Knowing the physical attributes of a target is often important when attempting to create cyber-kinetic responses. The physical structure of a network can provide clues as to the purpose of the network or point to vulnerabilities of constituent components of a network.\nBuilt upon the physical layer is a logical layer, which makes many of the aspects of the physical layer function. Firmware and software combine to form\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nThe Role of Intelligence in Cyberspace [111]\na logical layer. Just as there are numerous components to the physical layer there are hundreds if not thousands of different software and firmware applications that combine to make cyberspace function. When targeting a system it is often necessary to have intelligence on the attributes of the system being attacked. A piece of malware designed for a Windows 7 OS zero-day vulnerability will not work if that malware is deployed to a computer running Mac OS X Yosemite.\nLastly, the combination of the physical and the logical layers make the social layer possible. Even if the network and the software layers are air-gapped and highly secure, the social layer, the layer where people interact with the computing device, can still offer up vulnerabilities, as was illustrated in the Stuxnet incident. Knowing who is using a device and how they perceive and interact with the world around them can open up a variety of vulnerabilities including social engineering and phishing. The social layer is composed of both the actual people and personalities using the computing devices and the cyber persona of the individual using a platform.\nAggregating outward, the layers of cyberspace and their attributes in the vernacular of international relations constitute capabilities. Capabilities can be broadly defined as including mechanisms of offensive and defensive military strength such as size and number of offensive cyber units. Capabilities can include doctrinal measures or indicators such as official cyber security and warfare doctrines and can include the size and complexity of systems and their connections to other systems of importance. And capabilities can include technical capabilities such as programming skill within the environment.\nThe capabilities matrix included below is overly simplified, yet it indicates a host of areas where the intelligence community can provide significant assistance to decision-makers. What is important to consider is that these capabilities are not limited to the United States or its allies. Capabilities need to be assessed on a nation-by-nation basis and on a substate basis as well. These and many other unmentioned cyber capabilities combine to provide an accurate picture of the battlespace.\nIdentifying the capabilities and political situation of a new battlespace is difficult under the best of circumstances. Cyber is immensely complicated and therefore necessitates a logical template within which to examine capabilities. There is a need for a differentiation between the domestic (defensive) and the foreign (offensive) battlespace. This distinction is important both for tasking and decision-making. When the two battlespaces are separated, they are able to inform one another. Table 7.2 highlights many of the primary areas for consideration within the two battlespaces necessary for DBA and DBK.\nThe INTs above can and should be focused on these and related areas within the cyber domain. A holistic picture of the above components of the domain will\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER SEVEN\nTABLE 7.2 Components of Cyber DBA and DBK\n|  Domestic (Defense Oriented) | Foreign (Offense Oriented)  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  Policy considerations (offensive & defensive) | Policy considerations (offensive & defensive)  |\n|  Domestic network mapping | Foreign network mapping  |\n|  Budget allocations | Budget allocations  |\n|  ICT collaboration (alliances, partnerships) | Offensive unit size & training  |\n|  Defensive unit size & training | Defensive unit size & training  |\n|  Critical infrastructure | Critical infrastructure  |\n|  Insider threats for defensive purposes | Insider threats for offensive purposes  |\n|  Threat spectrum capabilities | Historical record of attack and defense  |\n|  Known vulnerabilities | Threat spectrum capabilities  |\n|  Time to attack recognition | Known vulnerabilities  |\n|  Time to attack attribution | ICT collaborations (alliances, partnerships)  |\n|  Systemic dependencies | Time to attack recognition  |\n|  Monitoring | Time to attack attribution  |\n|   | Systemic dependencies  |\n|   | Surveillance  |\n|   | Reconnaissance  |\nprovide decision-makers with a clearer visualization of the battlespace. Again, following Waltz, a visualization of any battlespace includes the following:\n\nEdward Amoroso argues the intelligence community should focus on creating an addition to the conventional intelligence briefs that consist solely of information pertaining to cyber.[31] Amoroso indicates such a report should focus on current security posture, top and new security risks, automated metrics, and human interpretation. Amoroso's case for the creation of a cyber-specific intelligence brief is sound and works toward promoting an accurate and realistic understanding of the threats and opportunities within this new and evolving domain relevant to national security.\n# POLICY CONSIDERATIONS\nThe Joint Chiefs of Staff have placed an increasing emphasis on the cyber domain within various joint doctrine publications. Joint doctrines provide insight into the needs of the services and policy-makers in the employment of and defense against cyber attacks. Documents also include many of the ways cyber\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nThe Role of Intelligence in Cyberspace [113]\nhas come to rely heavily on intelligence assets. Information superiority has become a mission critical aspect of defending national security. The Department of Defense's \"Joint Doctrine for Command and Control Warfare\" dating back to 1996 highlights the importance of intelligence products in support of C2W. The document indicates the use of intelligence assists in the conceptualization of all aspects of a battlespace.\nComprehension of any battlespace, including the cyber domain, requires understanding the policy environment in which an action occurs. Is there a national cyber defense strategy within the targeted country? How have they publicly or privately declared they would respond to hostile acts within the cyber domain? An example of the policy environment can be found in the \"Department of Defense Strategy for Operating in Cyberspace.\" The strategy outlines five strategic initiatives in its declassified report:\nStrategic Initiative 1: Treat cyberspace as an operational domain to organize, train, and equip so that DoD can take full advantage of cyberspace's potential\nStrategic Initiative 2: Employ new defense operating concepts to protect DoD networks and systems\nStrategic Initiative 3: Partner with other U.S. government departments and agencies and the private sector to enable a whole-of-government cyber security strategy\nStrategic Initiative 4: Build robust relationships with U.S. allies and international partners to strengthen collective cyber security\nStrategic Initiative 5: Leverage the nation's ingenuity through an exceptional cyber workforce and rapid technological innovation\nThe recently declassified sections of the report cited in the media indicate a doctrinal shift in the way the DoD approaches the cyber domain. The Wall Street Journal reports that DoD sources as early as 2011 indicated that some instances of cyber attacks can constitute an act of war.[32] This has further developed as recently as September 2014 with the NATO pledge for mutual defense in the event of significant cyber attacks that might result in the invocation of Article 5.[33] When asked what constitutes an act of war in cyberspace that would rise to a level that would result in the successful invocation of Article 5 for mutual defense, NATO secretary general Rasmussen said that the goal was to achieve \"strategic ambiguity\" to keep adversaries guessing and to act as \"ambiguous deterrence.\"[34]\nAlthough the current position on what constitutes an act of war in cyberspace within the eyes of the United States and NATO remains uncertain, understanding the policy positions within the domestic battlespace and in the foreign battlespace helps alleviate information asymmetries and establish clearly identifiable patterns for response. Whether it is the knowledge that Germany and the Netherlands both have official cyber security doctrines or that China has begun implementing a policy of making offensive cyber capabilities a strategic priority,\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER SEVEN\nthe overt and covert collection of policy positions provides policy-makers with a foundation for understanding intelligence related to cyber.\nPolicy platforms also help to codify international law, to create zones of norms or an identifiable policy framework in which states will interact or respond to incidents emanating from cyberspace.³⁵ While both the United States and Russia have made known a cyber attack could constitute an act of war, there has been little elaboration on specific characteristics of such an attack within the official policy-making circles of government. Often states will intentionally leave room for policy ambiguity as a mechanism of deterrence.³⁶ Understanding ambiguity, information gaps, and information asymmetry is crucial particularly in comprehending how leaders arrive at decisions. As in conventional warfare, in cyber conflict the minimization of or the knowledge about what a potential adversary will do in a given situation provides a strategic edge. Although there has been little in the form of codified policy delineation on what level of cyber attack would constitute an act of war, the academic community has been heavily engaged in attempting to apply existing legal frameworks to the cyber domain. The most notable work in this arena is the Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare, which works through in rigorous detail how actions within cyberspace could fall within existing international law.³⁷ Yet as rigorous as the work is, there is no single government required to adhere to its findings on the applicability of international law, and even within the laws themselves there was a significant amount of debate as to what constituted various levels of action in cyberspace. Instead of thinking of sponsored academic works such as the Tallinn Manual as clear policies to which states should adhere, they should be instead thought of as roadmaps to guide states in developing policies.\n# CE—NETWORK MAPPING, SYSTEMIC DEPENDENCIES, AND HISTORICAL RECORDS\nUnderstanding the policy environment both domestically and among foreign adversaries is only part of the larger intelligence process. Cyber exploitation (CE) constitutes a series of technological and analytical approaches to cyber-specific espionage. CE for the purposes of conventional intelligence collection can include the penetration of foreign networks to secure information on weapons systems, policy positions, and much more. CE is invasive yet does not disrupt, deny, or destroy data; it collects data. When CE operations focus intelligence on the cyber domain for offensive and defensive purposes, the objective is to understand the systems themselves. The goal becomes identifying the strengths and weaknesses of systems, the connectivity of systems to points of interests, and the interaction of those systems with strategic and tactical objectives.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nThe Role of Intelligence in Cyberspace [115]\nThere are numerous methods of CE; for the purposes of simplicity only a few are examined here. Network mapping is a form of CE that studies the physical connectivity of networks or the availability of insecure ports. This type of mapping provides information on what types of systems and servers operate on different networks and identifies the characteristics of the various component parts these systems constitute. Network mapping can drill down to very low levels on particular networks and provide significant information speed and types of hardware on various networks. This information can also be used to isolate portions of networks to identify potential heavy traffic users or other sources of potential exploitation.\nNetwork mapping is also useful for illustrating the potential for any particular targeted attack to extend beyond its intended target and result in collateral damage or blowback. Conceptually network mapping is not dissimilar from attempting to map radar or surface-to-air missile locations prior to a bombing campaign. The intent of network mapping is to gain an operational knowledge of an adversary's systems prior to engaging in an OCO.\nForensic analysis of the Stuxnet worm found the worm partially employed network mapping to target its attacks, focusing on isolated networks using memory sticks as the initial method of transmission.[38] Once in, Stuxnet focused its attack on networks with programmable logic controllers (PLCs) of a specific type and caused uranium enrichment centrifuges to malfunction.[39] The level of sophistication required to drill down to get to this level of detail to plan an attack is remarkable, particularly considering the complexity and number of overall systems and the air-gapped nature of the systems.\nNetwork mapping is both an offensive and defensive intelligence endeavor. To adequately prepare both the defensive and offensive battlespaces, an accurate picture of systems is needed. Arguably the dual domestic-foreign pictures are complementary and help avoid violating part 2.13 of Executive Order 12333, which prevents any covert action from influencing U.S. political processes, public opinion, policies, media, or various sections of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.[40]\nNetwork mapping and monitoring is a double-edged sword. Legally network mapping can be considered CE, and therefore domestic network mapping by U.S. intelligence agencies without a warrant would be prohibited. However, network mapping is of critical importance to the maintenance of national security infrastructures. Thus far the intelligence community does not have a formal commitment from the White House or the Justice Department to engage in any domestic CE operations.[41] Currently in the United States there is an uneasy and inefficient public-private commitment to providing information on network security across critical infrastructure. A thorough understanding of domestic and foreign networks assists in visualization for both offensive and defensive\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER SEVEN\npurposes, and effort to push reasoned analysis of threats has begun to make its way into Congress.⁴²\nNetwork mapping assists in the identification of network components. Once network components are known, it becomes necessary to explore vulnerabilities within systems. Most damaging are zero-day vulnerabilities, which are vulnerabilities in computer applications of which even system administrators are unaware. The Stuxnet attack exposed several zero-day vulnerabilities in the Windows software controlling/monitoring the programmable logic controllers, causing the attached centrifuges to spin outside of their safe operational standards.\nSystemic vulnerabilities necessitate a thorough understanding of the historical record of different types of attacks and exploits. The identification of zero-day vulnerabilities should lead network administrators to immediately patch these gaps. Intelligence plays a role in identifying what types of attacks have been used in the past and what vulnerabilities these attacks attempted to exploit. Historical accounting is important for both offensive and defensive preparation of the battlespace. For obvious reasons it is important to prevent repeat attacks on domestic systems; at the same time it is important not to engage in repeat attack methods once a vulnerability on an opposing system has been fixed. Such an attack would likely be ineffective and lead to anonymity-attribution problems.\nThe historical accounting of attack types by countries and substate actors also alerts operators within the intelligence and military community to the threat spectrum capabilities of a particular cyber adversary. Understanding the threat spectrum capabilities of states facilitates an accurate conceptualization of their power to operate within the domain. Table 7.3 is a representation of known threat spectrum capabilities.\nThe above areas of consideration within CE are only a small sampling of the overall tasking priorities for intelligence using CE methods. They hint at a broad applicability for CYBERINT methods in the preparation of the battlespace.\n# CONVENTIONAL INTELLIGENCE\nIntelligence collected on budgetary allocations, offensive and defensive cyber unit sizes, and training methodologies provides the clearest parallel to conventional intelligence. As in conventional intelligence, most countries are frequently unwilling to release data on absolute military expenditures or the sizes and force structures within their military. Military capabilities are a closely guarded secret in most countries. Capabilities are particularly secretive in the cyber domain. Often if cyber capabilities are exposed, they cease to be capabilities.⁴³ Once Stuxnet was discovered by the Iranians, defensive measures were taken to \"plug\" the holes the Stuxnet attack employed. This dramatically reduces\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nTABLE 7.3 Cyber Threat Spectrum\n|  Levels (Types) of Attack | Description | Feasibility | Complexity  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  Propaganda | The propagation of information via the Internet to affect public, private, or governmental opinion.

Whereas missiles can be launched with repeated success because the ability to defend against a moving projectile is difficult, a similar cyber weapon is more easily defended against once it has been identified. Antivirus software can be reprogrammed to identify and isolate repeat threats, and zero-day vulnerabilities can be patched.\nAn excellent example of an open source analysis of cyber capabilities comes from Stokes, Lin, and Hsiao, who examine in explicit detail the construction, location, leadership, and mission of many aspects of the Chinese People's Liberation Army information warfare programs.⁴⁴ Their report is an example of a high-value detailed analysis that could be supplemented by conventional intelligence to enhance policy-maker and combatant commander comprehension of the battlespace. The detailed analysis of the location and force structure can cause an enemy to shift its tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and make them less reliable. Alternatively, not revealing that information has been gained on TTPs can provide an offensive edge in cyber operations.\nThe implications for conventional intelligence collection methods indicate that intelligence on cyber does not necessarily need to remain cyberbound or exclusively within the realm of CE. Many metrics such as force size matter in cyber and can be examined to create a better assessment of potential adversaries. Cyber force size is particularly important from a malware development perspective. Complex coding scripts typically necessitate large numbers of programmers to develop and test the scripts. The ability for an individual to accomplish highly complex attacks is possible but less likely than a large cyber warfare unit working with the same objective.\nLikewise, knowing where a unit is located or how programmers were trained can help planners determine the best response to a particular attack, or how best to manipulate their organizational structure. Derek Clark and Kai Konrad refer to this as identifying the weakest link.⁴⁵ The identification of the weakest link is particularly important in cyber defense and offense. There are multiple fronts (systems) needing defense. All it takes is one \"best shot\" to achieve significant damage. While this weakest link can be identified through CE operations outlined in the previous section, it can also be identified within the training, command, and organizational structure of units charged with conducting or protecting against cyber attacks.\nClosely related to the conventional military metrics above, yet likely unique to the cyber domain, are public-private ICT collaborations. Although most countries have programs for military public and private collaborations with universities and businesses for research and development, within the cyber domain the importance of this relationship is magnified for multiple reasons. First, much of the training and education necessary to conduct offensive or defensive oper\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nThe Role of Intelligence in Cyberspace [119]\nations within cyberspace can be learned at public institutions or can be crafted for private sector use. This extends far beyond the development of technology to the actual training of the warfighter, the development of the platforms upon which the domain rests, and more. Second, these collaborations spread out but do not diffuse potential vulnerabilities.\nBecause collaborations can form the foundational aspects of the cyber warriors within offensive and defensive units, they can train, equip, and prepare in ways far different from conventional military means. Most countries have a balance between civilian and military protection of their national cyber infrastructures based largely on the development of computer emergency response teams (CERTs). An intelligence assessment of the strength and quality of ICT collaborations is of critical importance in understanding the cyber battlespace.\nICT collaborations are not necessarily official and do not need to be highly structured and regimented. Alexander Klimburg provides evidence Russia and China have created groups of plausibly deniable cyber attackers.[46] Creating an accurate open source measure of unofficial collaborations is difficult. An intelligence focus on unofficial collaborations with entities can contextualize cyber incidents such as the 2007 cyber attacks directed at Estonian governmental, bank, and communications websites.[47] The attacks were motivated by a decision to move a Russian war memorial from central Tallinn. While initial reports indicated Russia was the culprit, Russia denied any participation in the cyber attacks.[48] The reality is somewhat murkier and more akin to an unofficial sanction or condoning of cyber attacks by the Russian government.[49]\nThe collection and production of intelligence on more conventional attributes of pertinence to the cyber domain is a role in which the intelligence community is likely already engaged. Occasionally reports on issues relating to this category of intelligence are published for public consumption. A recent report of this type was produced for the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission to examine China's capability to conduct cyber warfare and cyber exploitation.[50] Knowledge of capabilities is still applicable to the cyber domain and is greatly influenced by conventional intelligence collection methods and subsequent analysis, which contextualizes the meaning of raw intelligence.\n## HUMINT AND CYBER\nHuman intelligence (HUMINT) stands out in cyber for two particular reasons. First, HUMINT agents can provide accurate internal information on systems and access to those systems unavailable through CE and other intelligence collection methods. Second, human assets can serve as a bridge between the external world and air-gapped or other forms of secure networks. As was indicated above, it is likely that the Stuxnet virus was distributed using a thumb drive,\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER SEVEN\nwhich needed to be inserted into a machine within an air-gapped network. HUMINT agents can serve as a vulnerability against which most network administrators will be unable to provide significant protection.\nThe role of a HUMINT asset with access to information on networks can be extremely damaging. Even if the agent is on a lightly classified network, the repercussions of his or her actions can be enormous. The scandal caused by Bradley Manning (now named Chelsea Manning) leaking more than 260,000 diplomatic cables to WikiLeaks in 2010 is illustrative of the problem posed by internal threats.⁵¹ Manning’s leak and the even more damaging 2013 document releases by Edward Snowden, a former employee of a contractor affiliated with both the NSA and CIA, highlight the potential damage a rogue employee can have on the ability of the intelligence community to keep information secret.⁵² Snowden’s insider collection and subsequent release of documents pertaining to the National Security Agency likely constitutes one of the most significant intelligence leaks of all time and resulted in an estimated 1.7 million documents being released in violation of U.S. classification law.⁵³ Moreover, unlike the leaks by Manning, the Snowden leaks revealed many of the TTPs used by the NSA in its intelligence operations in the cyber domain. These revelations have been extremely damaging and have resulted in changes in the way adversaries safeguard their cyber infrastructure.\nHUMINT threats need to be developed and enhanced for offensive intelligence and protected against for domestic national security counterintelligence. Gaining access to the technical schematics, documents, information, login procedures, or any of a multitude of other targets of intelligence a HUMINT asset could provide is a critical aspect added directly by intelligence to the understanding of the cyber domain. Furthermore, HUMINT agents are almost impossible to detect under normal circumstances as they can often engage in significant espionage while still easily performing the normal duties. Unlike the spy thriller days of old when agents had to sneak out of a building with classified documents in a folder or a box, they can often place thousands or millions of documents on a solid-state drive and easily conceal it upon exiting a facility. Many of these drives are smaller in size than a penny.\nBeyond the collection of intelligence from HUMINT sources, these insiders can assist in the implementation of cyber actions. Information within a 2005 report by the U.S. Secret Service in cooperation with Carnegie Mellon indicated that up to 29 percent of all attacks against a surveyed group of critical infrastructure stakeholders were initiated by insiders.⁵⁴ The majority of motivations behind these attacks were not related to intelligence or covert action. This, however, does not preclude the possibility of using insiders to affect or gain information or access on adversary systems. The recruitment and maintenance of insider threats by the intelligence community should be a top priority. These\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nThe Role of Intelligence in Cyberspace\nFIGURE 7.1 Timeline for Attack Implementation\nagents can offer a mission a critical component, often during times when more lengthy intelligence collection processes are constrained by events.\n# TIME FOR ATTACK RECOGNITION, COMPLETION, AND ATTRIBUTION\nAttack recognition and attribution are also critical for both a defensive and offensive battlespace planning. All of the intelligence collection methods and the focus of the intel process of trying to comprehend the cyber domain culminate in understanding, from a mission critical orientation, the progression of cyber attacks. Figure 7.1 is a simplified model for understanding attack planning and progression within a battlespace modeled loosely on the JP 3-51 electronic warfare-planning model.[55] This model is informed by intelligence collection. Line one of the figure indicates a policy-maker's perspective on the process of engaging in conflict. A conflict initiation is (o) planned, (1) implemented, and (2) completed. Policy-makers want to know what resources any given action will take and how long it will take to complete it. In cyber a more accurate timeline for action in cyberspace requires (o) intelligence collection, (1) operational planning of the attack with an informed knowledge of the battlespace, (2) understanding of the time it takes for the attack to be completed, (3) how long until the attack is recognized as an attack by the adversary, (4) how long until that adversary can do something about the attack, (5) how long until the adversary assigns attribution for the attack. The ordering of the items listed above greatly affects the ability for an attack to be conducted successfully. Intelligence informs the policy-maker and commander as to the feasibility of a particular type of attack and the probability of success. If recognition of an attack occurs early in the timeline of events the probability of success is diminished.\nThe timeline can be tested in much the same way conventional weapons are tested. It would be absurd to send a bomber over a potential target with a completely untested bomb, or to send a soldier into battle with an untested model of rifle. Just as weapons are tested in the physical world, they need to be tested in the cyber domain as well. This testing provides added information to both\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER SEVEN\nFIGURE 7.2 The Influence of Intelligence on Cyber Operations\nModified from E. Waltz, Information Warfare.\nthe policy-maker and the combatant commander as to the effectiveness of the weapon and the timeline of events above. If a cyber weapon is slow and easily detectable, its probability for success is diminished. This lowered probability for success does not nullify its use but does condition it.\nOne aspect of this phase of IPB is that it is extremely beneficial to both the offensive and defensive strategic and tactical operations. By planning and testing potential attacks against theoretical adversarial systems, the intelligence community provides an out-of-the-box perspective necessary to prevent similar attacks against domestic targets. This logic would indicate an attempt to use a worm like Stuxnet against the U.S. infrastructure would run into greater problems than if the weapon had been developed first elsewhere.\n# IPB AND ITS IMPACT ON CYBER\nThe role of intelligence in cyber is not dissimilar from its role in the conventional domains. There are new areas in which collection and analysis need to occur, yet its overall objective remains the same. Returning to Edward Waltz's concept of information preparation of the battlefield, figure 7.2 illustrates intelligence's influence on operations originating within the cyber domain. The role of intelligence in cyber is to accurately facilitate an understanding of those\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nThe Role of Intelligence in Cyberspace [123]\nentities and the possible tools by which to influence them. The cyber domain is surrounded with hype and hysteria. Many of the claims are accurately based in reality. But the known unknowns are still enormous within this evolving domain, and it is incumbent on intelligence to provide an accurate assessment of the current state of affairs.\nAll-source intelligence for cyber operations requires the intelligence community to think beyond domestic system defense. The focus should be balanced between foreign and domestic intelligence, thereby mutually informing one another and creating a systemic defense for national assets in addition to better facilitating decision-makers with a more accurate picture of how a potential cyber attack might succeed or fail.\n# CYBER AS COVERT ACTION\nTo further define the role of intelligence in cyber, it is necessary to look more deeply into the laws codifying the conduct of the intelligence community. All of the above sections provide a framework for defining the role of intelligence with regard to IPB. Cyber conflict is, by its very nature, covert. Even if an attack is discovered, it is often unattributable. Attacks can be designed to go unnoticed and affect changes to systems and their components for days, weeks, or months without detection. Even in instances where groups such as Anonymous publically take credit for attacks, responsibility is typically claimed post hoc. Nearly all examples of state-on-state cyber attacks have been covert.\nThe covert nature of cyber brings full circle Warner's definition of intelligence as attempting to influence. Covert action is a secret operation to influence a foreign entity. At least in theory, most, if not all, cyber attacks begin covertly. Section 1.7(a)(4) of Executive Order 12333 regarding intelligence activities describes covert action:\nConduct convert action activities approved by the President. No agency except the Central Intelligence Agency (or the Armed Forces of the United States in time of war declared by the Congress or during any period covered by a report from the President to the Congress consistent with the War Powers Resolution, Public Law 93-148) may conduct any covert action activity unless the President determines that another agency is more likely to achieve a particular objective.[56]\nEvident in the early structuring of the governmental approach to cyberspace is the categorization of cyber operations as covert actions. The Department of Defense originally took the lead with General Keith Alexander as the head of both NSA and Cyber Command, a path that has continued now that Admiral Michael Rogers has taken over as the head of both organizations. This indicates the president has established an agency other than the Central Intelligence\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER SEVEN\nAgency as the primary covert operator within this domain. While the logic behind having a military intelligence organization commander and an organizational structure that falls under the U.S. Strategic Command (STRATCOM) runs counter to EO 12333, the institutional capacity of the DoD in the technical domain and the scale of the problem being faced within this new domain make the assignment appropriate.\n# SUMMARIZING THE ROLE OF INTELLIGENCE WITHIN THE CYBER DOMAIN\nIn defining the role of intelligence within the cyber domain, it is necessary to take a holistic approach. From a collection perspective, the intelligence community should be and has been working in coordination with a hybrid push-and-pull intelligence cycle to both elevate the importance of this domain and facilitate collection within it. The emphasis has been heavily defensive up to this point and largely focused on countering threats rather than anticipating them. This needs to change, and the only way this can change is if the intelligence community begins to actively turn its sights on adversaries and develop more rigorous all-source intelligence combining novel CYBERINT technologies to augment reporting on this domain. Parroting Amoroso's assertion, cyber should be included on the daily intelligence briefs of policy-makers. The inclusion would likely start the process of demystification of this immensely complicated domain.\nCyberspace is a domain that can be used to fulfill all aspects of Warner's definition of intelligence to some degree. It is a domain in which it is possible to gain understanding about other states beyond and within the domain itself, but it is also a domain that can influence other states' policy decisions as well as perceptions. In particular, accurate intelligence on both sides of the domestic-foreign divide can mutually inform decision-makers about vulnerabilities and the eventual decision to use cyber as an offensive weapon or how best to defend against attacks. Moreover, intelligence can rein in the debate on cyber to a more realistic area of operations predicated on sound estimates rather than on grandiose speculation.\nThe intelligence community itself commonly is the point of origin for OCOs emanating from the cyber domain and will likely serve as a force multiplier in instances where a combined conventional cyber attack is necessary. To engage in cyber conflict, just as in conventional conflict, intelligence is needed to prepare the battlespace and facilitate an accurate assessment of the probability for success and utility for any type of operation. This preparation hones the weapons, decisions, and effect of a potential operation. More importantly for national security, a thorough and accurate preparation of both the foreign and domestic battlespaces will serve to inform and enhance cyber security.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms"

Intelligence is increasingly facilitating information superiority through an understanding of the cyber domain. The Department of Defense's \"Joint Vision 2020\" establishes the goal of information superiority on the battlefield. This information superiority enables decision superiority and favorably tilts the strategic and tactical balance. Information superiority is built on cyber power, scale and complexity of attacks, robustness of defense, policy positions, systemic vulnerabilities and dependencies, and actor anonymity and attribution issues. Intelligence plays a mission critical role in assessing these characteristics. The discussion below examines the role of intelligence in identifying these characteristics within the cyber domain and examines how it influences the decision-making of policy-makers. Specifically the focus hones in on how intelligence increases the effectiveness of identifying potential attackers within the cyber domain and informs the decision-making of policy-makers when engaging in covert cyber action directed against a potential adversary. The discussion is designed to serve as a strategic framework in which to understand the role of intelligence within the cyber domain.\nIs it really necessary to examine the role of intelligence within the cyber domain as contextually different than in a conventional domain? The short answer is yes. Cyber necessitates independent examination because it is characteristically different, and yet at the same time it is a pervasive feature affecting outcomes within other domains. What differentiates cyber from land, sea, air, and space are three fundamental attributes relevant to intelligence practitioners. First, the cyber domain is a man-made domain. Second, military capabilities across the other domains are managed through the cyber domain. Third, military and civilian aspects of the cyber domain are often intertwined and difficult to differentiate. These attributes pose unique opportunities and problems for intelligence officials.\nThe man-made nature of the cyber domain makes it a largely virtual domain with its value corresponding to the speed and volume of information contained\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER SEVEN\nwithin it. However, the cyber domain is not entirely virtual and has numerous real-world connection points to everything from industrial control systems of power and water management facilities to the weapon systems of drones flying above distant battlefields.\nCyberspace is not tangible in the same way as more conventional domains and therefore necessitates a new form of dynamic intelligence evolving from all-source collection of conventional and novel intelligence sources. A recent National Research Council report states that intelligence in the cyber domain is useful for both strategic and tactical purposes.¹ The strategic and tactical importance of intelligence's role in influencing the cyber domain falls within the concept of all-source intelligence. Loch Johnson defines all-source intelligence as one of the fundamental propositions of a theory of strategic intelligence.² More importantly for the purposes of understanding the operational and political environments within which offensive and defensive actions in cyberspace can occur, it is necessary to understand what intelligence is within decisions regarding the cyber domain and how intelligence influences those decisions.\n## DEFINING INTELLIGENCE\nThere are dozens of different definitions of intelligence, each of which is in some way applicable to understanding cyber action. One of the more succinct and conceptually ordered comes from Michael Warner, who defines intelligence as a \"secret, state activity to understand or influence foreign entities.\"³ His definition establishes the fundamental premises of both collection and analysis, while including actions designed to influence. Intelligence is vital to the cyber domain because foreign entities are increasingly storing, managing, and directing their governmental, public, private, and military functions in a digitized world.\nThe traditional intelligence collection types (INTs) are still of immense value, yet they must be combined with aspects of the digitized target spectrum to provide a holistic view of both threats and opportunities. At present the majority of studies in the public domain have focused on defense.⁴ This defensive posture is made clear by General Keith Alexander, the director of the National Security Agency and commander of United States Cyber Command, when he writes: \"US Cyber Command's efforts and planning aim to ensure that the DoD has done all it can to defend and deter determined adversaries, mitigate dangerous threats, and address nagging vulnerabilities, so that even our most capable opponents will know that interfering with our nation's equities in cyberspace is a losing proposition.\"⁵\nThis defensive and deterrent-reliant posture is limiting and prone to inadequacies. Echoing Machiavelli and to some extent Sun Tzu, the adage \"the best defense is a good offense\" offers a novel way of considering action and intelli\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nThe Role of Intelligence in Cyberspace\ngence within cyber. More accurately, it allows for a systematic approach to both national cyber defensive and offensive resource allocations. Beyond the efficiency argument for shifting the focus from solely defense to a balance between defense and offense, intelligence collection can help to inform offensive strategies and the decision to use cyber as a weapon. The role of intelligence within cyber becomes increasingly important when considering the difficulty of achieving any significant measure of deterrence within the cyber domain.⁶\nThe defensive orientation of the majority of cyber literature has a constraining effect on decision-making processes for the use of offensive cyber weapons. This defensive focus is largely due to both the alarmist calls of some scholars and policy-makers and an information communications technologies industry orientation offering many more strategies for defense than for offense. While I do not dispute the need for defense, this defensive focus leads the national security establishment down a path of attempting to create an impenetrable system. If there is one thing that is abundantly clear in the cyber domain it is that the only impenetrable system is the one that has not been made. Cyber is based on physics and algorithms. The mathematics and science behind security measures can be immensely complex and take massive computing power to penetrate, but that does not make them impenetrable. Even the most robust systems secured with checks and encryptions are still highly vulnerable to their users' ignorance or malice, as was the case with Edward Snowden in 2013.\nInstead of focusing on a solely carte blanche defensive posture toward cyber security, intelligence can provide both an offensive and defensive picture more effective at safeguarding national security. Taking a step back from the conventional cyber security literature, intelligence can direct cyber security efforts to not merely safeguard national security but also provide an offensive tool for use against other states. The vast literature on intelligence, ranging from the way intelligence influences the policy-making process to how it helps to understand aspects of the development of utility for actions, serves as a guide in defining the role of intelligence within the cyber domain.\nReflecting on Warner's definition of intelligence, the spectrum of intelligence collection methods—from human intelligence (HUMINT) to the more technical collection methods of signals intelligence (SIGINT), measurement and signatures intelligence (MASINT), geospatial intelligence (GEOINT), and open source intelligence (OSINT)—works together in an all-source environment to provide an accurate understanding of foreign entities. (Table 7.1 provides a quick definitional reference for the various intelligence collection types.) The understanding provided by intelligence has largely focused on the conventional domains and on political decision-making. However, as decisions in conventional domains increasingly migrate toward cyberspace, and the systems controlling the tools used in these domains increasingly become digitally connected, the\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER SEVEN\nTABLE 7.1 Intelligence Collection Methods\n|  Intelligence Source Type | Definition  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  Open Source (OSINT) | Overtly available information found, selected, and acquired from publicly available source.  |\n|  Measurement and Signatures (MASINT) | Intelligence detected and classified from targets that identify or describe signatures (distinctive characteristics) of fixed or dynamic target sources.  |\n|  Human (HUMINT) | Intelligence collected through interpersonal contact via human collection officers.  |\n|  Geospatial (GEOINT)* | The exploitation and analysis of imagery and geospatial information to describe, assess, and visually depict physical features and geographically referenced activities on the earth.

Williams, Shimeal, and Dunlevy, \"Intelligence Analysis for Internet Security.\" CYBERINT is considered independent of traditional SIGINT. However, as in many of the other types of intelligence collection, techniques and agencies often overlap.\nimportance of understanding the technical schematics and decision processes becomes vital to national security.\nNick Cullather, in an article on digital connections on the battlefield, indicates significant advances in the development of network-centric warfare. Cullather notes that the rise of a \"revolution in military affairs\" has largely not been matched by the intelligence community's ability to keep up. This is of particular importance when looking beyond the network-centric battlefield of conventional weapons to the new zone of confrontation within cyberspace itself. Similarly, Michael Herman finds that counterterrorism intelligence analysis requires a broad spectrum of information sources brought together. ICT facilitates the mitigation of \"stovepipes\" and increases the efficiency in information transference. Information transmission has also been facilitated following the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 by the creation of \"fusion centers.\" ICT has a role to play not only in the conduct of war on the battlefield, but also in the management of a conventional traditional threat spectrum within the fusion centers and beyond in the wider intelligence community.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nThe Role of Intelligence in Cyberspace\nTerrorism is not commonly regarded as part of the conventional threat spectrum, yet in reality most terrorist acts take place in the physical world and require bombs and guns. However, the information coordination necessary to organize, plan, and conduct warfare, terrorist acts, and political strategies has largely shifted to cyberspace. The 2008 Mumbai terrorist attacks are a poignant example of terrorists leveraging technology and open source intelligence collected from public sites and software such as Google Earth to plan and orchestrate mass murder. As horrific as the use of digital tools for planning attacks is, it is not isolated to open source intelligence collection via tools. Terrorists also use open source cryptography and crypto-currencies to finance their operations. Intelligence agencies are in a competition with other states and organizations to leverage tools effectively to prevent attacks by terrorists and to mitigate international incidents before they arise.\nWhile open source research is fundamentally more powerful than ever before, available open source information provides only a limited aperture to realistically size up threats and targets within cyberspace itself. The problem of intelligence in cyberspace is massive both in terms of scale and complexity of data. Joel Brenner, a former inspector general of the National Security Agency and head of U.S. counterintelligence, indicated there has been an enormous threat emanating from within cyberspace that is not being adequately addressed.\nModern warfare, command and control warfare (C2W), is network centric. Large swaths of the national critical infrastructures in states that pose conventional security and economic threats to the United States are controlled by digital systems. The literature is less focused on the need for understanding these vulnerabilities than it is on safeguarding them. The defensive focus, to a large degree, overshadows the development of offensive capabilities.\nPhil Williams, Timothy Shimeal, and Casey Dunlevy make a well-reasoned case arguing for focused intelligence efforts on identifying threats to national cyber security. These authors make a valid point that needs to be addressed and is being addressed by several national strategy documents on the topic, including the National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace and the \"International Strategy for Cyberspace.\" One report of particular importance addressing many of the issues brought up by Williams, Shimeal, and Dunlevy is the October 2011 report by the Office of the National Counterintelligence Executive on cyber espionage. A broad spectrum of federal strategies and reports has made identification and protection against vulnerabilities a top priority. More recently the president of the United States under Executive Order 13636 in February 2013 directed the government to begin actively seeking out and planning strategies to mitigate cyber threats to national critical infrastructure.\nThis is a process that is under way and includes an alphabet soup of agencies from across the civilian and military spectrum of the government. A re\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER SEVEN\ncurrent problem that keeps cropping up in many of the discussions on critical infrastructure is network awareness. Many companies and firms affiliated with critical infrastructure do not have an adequate understanding of their own vulnerabilities, let alone how they interact to create systemic threats. One industry based on personal communications and working experience that seems to be working very hard to address these issues is the U.S. financial sector, which in many ways is pioneering cyber security efforts under E.O. 13636.\nCurrently most cyber security is based on attacks or incidents in progress or that have already occurred. It is difficult, if not impossible, to defend against an unknown attack. Much of the effort in the United States cyber community now seems to be equivalent to plugging the holes in the dike after it floods. It is a fact that most cyber attacks are repeat attacks originating at the lower end of the threat spectrum, making the strategy of filling holes in the dike an absolute necessity in an effort to prevent repeat intrusions from identical or similar malware types. Yet this post hoc strategy largely fails to address the more serious problem of accurately anticipating what the next type of attack is going to be. This strategy, best referred to as a \"Maginot Line\" strategy, is prone to failure in areas where technological and strategic capabilities rapidly evolve. The real challenge is to develop intelligence-based approaches to cyberspace that prevent future attacks before they happen.\nThere is a significant and sustained effort underway on the defensive side of the cyber debate within the DoD to develop better security. The DoD is currently employing at least three categories of defensive teams to facilitate DoD network protection: DoD information network operations teams (DoDIN Ops), defensive cyber operations—internal defensive measures teams (DCO-IDM or cyber protection teams), and defensive cyber operations—response action teams (DCO-RA or national mission teams). Yet all of these teams are heavily reliant on intelligence on the cyber environment for defense (ICE-D). The teams that fit into these categories are tasked with segments of the overall problem. While the DoDIN-Ops teams are tasked with ensuring sustained secure operations on DoD networks, they are not focused on adversary behaviors in those networks. Their work is informed by adversary behaviors but seeks to maintain network security in aggregate. DCO-IDM or cyber protection teams function as hunter killers within the network. They are tasked with seeking out individuals engaging DoD networks illegally and stopping the attacks or exploits. DCO-RA or national mission teams are tasked with responding to adversary behavior in DoD networks. As should be readily apparent, the problem is enormous and relies on intelligence for all aspects of ICE-D functions. The DoD network environment alone is composed of millions of computing devices and users.\nBecause we exist in a world of known unknowns and unknown unknowns, to paraphrase Secretary Rumsfeld, cyber security is likely the former rather than\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nThe Role of Intelligence in Cyberspace\nthe latter.¹⁷ How can intelligence be used to improve the cyber security situation not only to protect the national infrastructure in a more systematic and logical manner but also to use this information to inform the decision-making processes of policy-makers?\nOne problem associated with the U.S. cyber community is proximity. Because the community develops, tests, and employs its own tools, it is unable to take into account methods of testing that have not yet threatened systems in the past. This is an in-the-box, out-of-the-box, forget-the-box problem. The designers of systems, software, and networks are talented and smart individuals; they lead the world in technical innovation, yet because they are inside their own systems, it becomes it intrinsically difficult to isolate unforeseen problems. United States Cyber Command and various other teams from the services and the various academies have tried to address this problem by creating competitive cyber teams that compete with one other and against civilian competitors in various challenges such as DefCon capture the flag contests and others. These various DCO and DoDIN-Ops teams also engage one another to consistently foster novel thinking on security.\nYet the challenge is immense, and solutions are best achieved by constant introspection. Below are several proposed strategies to help facilitate the development of improved defensive operations. First, the current orientation toward plugging holes must continue. While this post hoc process is frustrating, it prevents or at least slows further intrusions. The mentality of these DoDIN-Ops is one of defense. The objective is to secure and defend systems against all possible or known types of attacks. The most realistic approach is to defend against known types of attacks. The systems become fortified against repeat incidents or at least can minimize their severity. The work of these teams is not sexy; it is not offense oriented; it is a process of continuous network security development. Second, DCO-IDM teams must also actively hunt in government and defense networks for potential adversaries and leverage information gained through all source intelligence collection and communication with DoDIN-Ops, DCO-RA, and OCO teams to anticipate potential blind spots. These teams must also be regularly rotated to provide them time to think like attackers. Third, DCO-RA teams must leverage all-source intelligence and continuous communications with DCO-IDM and OCO teams to engage adversaries in a defensive posture on foreign networks before they endanger DoD networks. While these teams are in the process of getting organized and established, it is important that these teams have clear interteam communications to mitigate stovepiping. The co-location or consistent rotation of team members would likely facilitate enhanced operational results. The co-location and coordination of members within a team should be of paramount importance as it allows analysts and technicians the opportunity to collaborate and developed a detailed and synergistic understanding of capabilities.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER SEVEN\nThe wider intelligence community must use all-source methods to collect as much intelligence on potential opponents as possible. This means profiling every aspect of other nations' cyber offensive and defensive capabilities. This requires a robust all-source collection methodology. Signals intelligence must look for transmissions and communications as well as spikes in Internet traffic and geo-locate them using IP addresses. These geo-located IP addresses need to be analyzed using satellites and drones to provide accurate geospatial information on the areas in question. Open source intelligence collection should attempt to gain as much publicly available information as possible on areas of interest through legal means. Once all of this information has been compiled and assessed, targeted HUMINT operations should begin working on developing assets within these areas or with connections to these areas. These agents should be recruited for multiple purposes. First, they should be used to secure intelligence on the capabilities of potential adversaries. These capabilities are defined in more detail below. Second, agents should also be recruited to become potential insider threats, a tool of particular importance on air-gapped systems. Third, intelligence agencies should also place an emphasis on cyber exploitation (CE) and attempt to probe and map out network infrastructures, vulnerabilities, and strengths of adversaries. The last point is of importance both from an offensive and defensive strategic orientation.\nAnother major problem with the cyber domain arises out of its systemic complexity. As Williams, Shimeal, and Dunlevy accurately note, cyber defenders often do not have a realistic or accurate picture of their own systems, let alone the systems of adversaries who are attacking them. Following their recommendations, the national security community would be prudent to make use of the principle of knowing yourself. This requires a consistent focus on domestic systems. However, only focusing on domestic systems leads to the \"Maginot Line\" tendency in which it is assumed networks are created to be impenetrable.\n# INTELLIGENCE AND THE CYBER BATTLESPACE\nThe cyber domain is a modern battlespace and necessitates a holistic understanding. To defend against or engage in offensive actions, it is necessary to have an accurate understanding of the operational environment. According to Edward Waltz, any battlespace, whether offensive or defensive, requires a combination of dominant battlespace awareness (DBA) and dominant battlespace knowledge (DBK). The process of identifying what is and is not important to understanding a particular battlespace largely falls to the discretion of policy-makers within the intelligence cycle.\nIn writing about intelligence and decision-making, Stephen Marrin states: \"the intelligence cycle starts with decision-maker information requirements lev\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nThe Role of Intelligence in Cyberspace\nied on intelligence collection capabilities, the processing of collected raw intelligence and transmission of this processed material to analysts who decipher its meaning, and relay that understanding back to the decision-makers.”²¹\nThe decision-maker engages in tasking through a number of different “pull” mechanisms including governmental reports, hearings before Congress, presidential directives, and executive orders. These tasking methods and others combine to facilitate within the intelligence community an accurate understanding of what constitutes the battlespace in the eyes of the policy-maker. Often the planning and direction can be informal requests from the executive or from Congress, and at other times it can come from official strategy documents.\nPrior to 9/11, terrorism was a priority, but the planning and direction of resources had not yet reached a critical mass sufficient to prevent the terrible attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Marrin and others find the intelligence process frequently fails to adequately define what constitutes a tasking priority for the intelligence community, necessitating a “push” from within the community outward. There are many instances in which policy-makers ignore, misinterpret, or misuse intelligence despite adequate tasking and intelligence production and dissemination.²²\nThe push mechanism of the intelligence community can happen in several ways. Often it can follow what constructivists call “norm entrepreneurs.” Entrepreneurs in the cyber domain include Richard Clarke, or John Arquilla and David Ronfeldt, among others.²³ These individuals bring to national policymakers’ attention issues of importance and help direct the intelligence community’s efforts. If, however, they make outlandish claims and statements, their push for new norms can have a backlash and inspire counter-entrepreneurs such as Thomas Rid, who writes that cyber war does not and will not occur.²⁴ Most traditional intelligence push comes from within the intelligence community itself.²⁵ Because the intelligence community is pushing intelligence not requested by the decision-makers, the concept of the intelligence cycle can, as Marrin notes, become linear.²⁶\nBecause the domain is so complex, it is beneficial for the president and policy-makers to have individuals with the requisite understanding of the domain not only in policy and legal terms but also in technical terms. The position currently established is known as the cyber czar. While this position is typically filled by someone with policy or legal expertise, it is beneficial for that individual to have a wide background and a reasonable technical understanding so he or she can facilitate complex discussions. Former cyber czar Melissa Hathaway would be a prime example of the type of individual who could accurately convey the complexity of the technical and historical attributes of interactions in the domain while at the same time have a firm grasp on the policy and legal implications of future actions. This person then sits at the choke point of the\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER SEVEN\npush and pull on the cyber domain and distills the information into a balanced reality applicable for decision-makers.\nFor intelligence to adequately focus its sights on any battlespace, planning and direction from policy-makers must occur. Once policy-makers have established the importance of a battlespace, the intelligence community must find ways to deliver accurate and reliable intelligence. The objective of intelligence collection is not solely to provide real-time information on the battlespace; rather, it is best thought of as battlespace preparation or what Waltz refers to as \"intelligence preparation of the battlespace\" (IPB). Although Waltz specifically refers to IPB in the context of coordinated conventional warfare and the use of information operations in network-centric warfare, the theoretical principles apply across all domains. IPB, according to Waltz, includes providing an understanding of the \"physical, political, electronic, cyber, and other dimensions of the battlespace.\" Alan D. Campen and Douglas H. Dearth reiterate the concept of IPB in Cyberwar 3.0. They state that information warfare requires an accurate knowledge of the battlespace as well as real-time awareness of situations within the battlespace as they arise.\nBefore moving directly into how each collection type can add to a holistic picture of the battlespace, it is necessary to define what constitutes the battlespace in the cyber domain. The battlespace, according to Waltz, constitutes \"all decision-relevant elements within a defined battlespace, and the ability to predict with very high confidence near-term enemy actions and outcomes.\" More specifically this requires an understanding of human, material, and technical capabilities and the relationship of these capabilities within themselves and to other aspects of the operational environment. It is also important to understand the political implications of alterations in capabilities and the environment over time. A battlespace for cyber can be domestic or foreign and is considered to constitute three basic layers: physical, logical, and social layers. Intelligence must inform policy-makers on all three categories.\nThe physical layer is composed of a geographical location and the physical devices that constitute the environment. These devices can include hardware such as computers, switches, and routers. The devices that compose the physical layer can also include computing devices such as mobile phones, cars, airplanes, and ships. The physical layer also includes those devices used to facilitate cyber actions such as transoceanic cables, power stations, and buildings. Knowing the physical attributes of a target is often important when attempting to create cyber-kinetic responses. The physical structure of a network can provide clues as to the purpose of the network or point to vulnerabilities of constituent components of a network.\nBuilt upon the physical layer is a logical layer, which makes many of the aspects of the physical layer function. Firmware and software combine to form\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nThe Role of Intelligence in Cyberspace\na logical layer. Just as there are numerous components to the physical layer there are hundreds if not thousands of different software and firmware applications that combine to make cyberspace function. When targeting a system it is often necessary to have intelligence on the attributes of the system being attacked. A piece of malware designed for a Windows 7 OS zero-day vulnerability will not work if that malware is deployed to a computer running Mac OS X Yosemite.\nLastly, the combination of the physical and the logical layers make the social layer possible. Even if the network and the software layers are air-gapped and highly secure, the social layer, the layer where people interact with the computing device, can still offer up vulnerabilities, as was illustrated in the Stuxnet incident. Knowing who is using a device and how they perceive and interact with the world around them can open up a variety of vulnerabilities including social engineering and phishing. The social layer is composed of both the actual people and personalities using the computing devices and the cyber persona of the individual using a platform.\nAggregating outward, the layers of cyberspace and their attributes in the vernacular of international relations constitute capabilities. Capabilities can be broadly defined as including mechanisms of offensive and defensive military strength such as size and number of offensive cyber units. Capabilities can include doctrinal measures or indicators such as official cyber security and warfare doctrines and can include the size and complexity of systems and their connections to other systems of importance. And capabilities can include technical capabilities such as programming skill within the environment.\nThe capabilities matrix included below is overly simplified, yet it indicates a host of areas where the intelligence community can provide significant assistance to decision-makers. What is important to consider is that these capabilities are not limited to the United States or its allies. Capabilities need to be assessed on a nation-by-nation basis and on a substate basis as well. These and many other unmentioned cyber capabilities combine to provide an accurate picture of the battlespace.\nIdentifying the capabilities and political situation of a new battlespace is difficult under the best of circumstances. Cyber is immensely complicated and therefore necessitates a logical template within which to examine capabilities. There is a need for a differentiation between the domestic (defensive) and the foreign (offensive) battlespace. This distinction is important both for tasking and decision-making. When the two battlespaces are separated, they are able to inform one another. Table 7.2 highlights many of the primary areas for consideration within the two battlespaces necessary for DBA and DBK.\nThe INTs above can and should be focused on these and related areas within the cyber domain. A holistic picture of the above components of the domain will\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER SEVEN\nTABLE 7.2 Components of Cyber DBA and DBK\n|  Domestic (Defense Oriented) | Foreign (Offense Oriented)  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  Policy considerations (offensive & defensive) | Policy considerations (offensive & defensive)  |\n|  Domestic network mapping | Foreign network mapping  |\n|  Budget allocations | Budget allocations  |\n|  ICT collaboration (alliances, partnerships) | Offensive unit size & training  |\n|  Defensive unit size & training | Defensive unit size & training  |\n|  Critical infrastructure | Critical infrastructure  |\n|  Insider threats for defensive purposes | Insider threats for offensive purposes  |\n|  Threat spectrum capabilities | Historical record of attack and defense  |\n|  Known vulnerabilities | Threat spectrum capabilities  |\n|  Time to attack recognition | Known vulnerabilities  |\n|  Time to attack attribution | ICT collaborations (alliances, partnerships)  |\n|  Systemic dependencies | Time to attack recognition  |\n|  Monitoring | Time to attack attribution  |\n|   | Systemic dependencies  |\n|   | Surveillance  |\n|   | Reconnaissance  |\nprovide decision-makers with a clearer visualization of the battlespace. Again, following Waltz, a visualization of any battlespace includes the following:\n1. Developing a clear understanding of the state with relation to the enemy and environment.\n2. Envisioning a desired goal or objective representing the successful completion of the mission.\n3. Visualization of the sequence of activities that move the current state to the desired state.\nEdward Amoroso argues the intelligence community should focus on creating an addition to the conventional intelligence briefs that consist solely of information pertaining to cyber. Amoroso indicates such a report should focus on current security posture, top and new security risks, automated metrics, and human interpretation. Amoroso's case for the creation of a cyber-specific intelligence brief is sound and works toward promoting an accurate and realistic understanding of the threats and opportunities within this new and evolving domain relevant to national security.\n# POLICY CONSIDERATIONS\nThe Joint Chiefs of Staff have placed an increasing emphasis on the cyber domain within various joint doctrine publications. Joint doctrines provide insight into the needs of the services and policy-makers in the employment of and defense against cyber attacks. Documents also include many of the ways cyber\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nThe Role of Intelligence in Cyberspace\nhas come to rely heavily on intelligence assets. Information superiority has become a mission critical aspect of defending national security. The Department of Defense's \"Joint Doctrine for Command and Control Warfare\" dating back to 1996 highlights the importance of intelligence products in support of C2W. The document indicates the use of intelligence assists in the conceptualization of all aspects of a battlespace.\nComprehension of any battlespace, including the cyber domain, requires understanding the policy environment in which an action occurs. Is there a national cyber defense strategy within the targeted country? How have they publicly or privately declared they would respond to hostile acts within the cyber domain? An example of the policy environment can be found in the \"Department of Defense Strategy for Operating in Cyberspace.\" The strategy outlines five strategic initiatives in its declassified report:\nStrategic Initiative 1: Treat cyberspace as an operational domain to organize, train, and equip so that DoD can take full advantage of cyberspace's potential\nStrategic Initiative 2: Employ new defense operating concepts to protect DoD networks and systems\nStrategic Initiative 3: Partner with other U.S. government departments and agencies and the private sector to enable a whole-of-government cyber security strategy\nStrategic Initiative 4: Build robust relationships with U.S. allies and international partners to strengthen collective cyber security\nStrategic Initiative 5: Leverage the nation's ingenuity through an exceptional cyber workforce and rapid technological innovation\nThe recently declassified sections of the report cited in the media indicate a doctrinal shift in the way the DoD approaches the cyber domain. The Wall Street Journal reports that DoD sources as early as 2011 indicated that some instances of cyber attacks can constitute an act of war. This has further developed as recently as September 2014 with the NATO pledge for mutual defense in the event of significant cyber attacks that might result in the invocation of Article 5. When asked what constitutes an act of war in cyberspace that would rise to a level that would result in the successful invocation of Article 5 for mutual defense, NATO secretary general Rasmussen said that the goal was to achieve \"strategic ambiguity\" to keep adversaries guessing and to act as \"ambiguous deterrence.\"\nAlthough the current position on what constitutes an act of war in cyberspace within the eyes of the United States and NATO remains uncertain, understanding the policy positions within the domestic battlespace and in the foreign battlespace helps alleviate information asymmetries and establish clearly identifiable patterns for response. Whether it is the knowledge that Germany and the Netherlands both have official cyber security doctrines or that China has begun implementing a policy of making offensive cyber capabilities a strategic priority,\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER SEVEN\nthe overt and covert collection of policy positions provides policy-makers with a foundation for understanding intelligence related to cyber.\nPolicy platforms also help to codify international law, to create zones of norms or an identifiable policy framework in which states will interact or respond to incidents emanating from cyberspace.³⁵ While both the United States and Russia have made known a cyber attack could constitute an act of war, there has been little elaboration on specific characteristics of such an attack within the official policy-making circles of government. Often states will intentionally leave room for policy ambiguity as a mechanism of deterrence.³⁶ Understanding ambiguity, information gaps, and information asymmetry is crucial particularly in comprehending how leaders arrive at decisions. As in conventional warfare, in cyber conflict the minimization of or the knowledge about what a potential adversary will do in a given situation provides a strategic edge. Although there has been little in the form of codified policy delineation on what level of cyber attack would constitute an act of war, the academic community has been heavily engaged in attempting to apply existing legal frameworks to the cyber domain. The most notable work in this arena is the Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare, which works through in rigorous detail how actions within cyberspace could fall within existing international law.³⁷ Yet as rigorous as the work is, there is no single government required to adhere to its findings on the applicability of international law, and even within the laws themselves there was a significant amount of debate as to what constituted various levels of action in cyberspace. Instead of thinking of sponsored academic works such as the Tallinn Manual as clear policies to which states should adhere, they should be instead thought of as roadmaps to guide states in developing policies.\n# CE—NETWORK MAPPING, SYSTEMIC DEPENDENCIES, AND HISTORICAL RECORDS\nUnderstanding the policy environment both domestically and among foreign adversaries is only part of the larger intelligence process. Cyber exploitation (CE) constitutes a series of technological and analytical approaches to cyber-specific espionage. CE for the purposes of conventional intelligence collection can include the penetration of foreign networks to secure information on weapons systems, policy positions, and much more. CE is invasive yet does not disrupt, deny, or destroy data; it collects data. When CE operations focus intelligence on the cyber domain for offensive and defensive purposes, the objective is to understand the systems themselves. The goal becomes identifying the strengths and weaknesses of systems, the connectivity of systems to points of interests, and the interaction of those systems with strategic and tactical objectives.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nThe Role of Intelligence in Cyberspace\nThere are numerous methods of CE; for the purposes of simplicity only a few are examined here. Network mapping is a form of CE that studies the physical connectivity of networks or the availability of insecure ports. This type of mapping provides information on what types of systems and servers operate on different networks and identifies the characteristics of the various component parts these systems constitute. Network mapping can drill down to very low levels on particular networks and provide significant information speed and types of hardware on various networks. This information can also be used to isolate portions of networks to identify potential heavy traffic users or other sources of potential exploitation.\nNetwork mapping is also useful for illustrating the potential for any particular targeted attack to extend beyond its intended target and result in collateral damage or blowback. Conceptually network mapping is not dissimilar from attempting to map radar or surface-to-air missile locations prior to a bombing campaign. The intent of network mapping is to gain an operational knowledge of an adversary's systems prior to engaging in an OCO.\nForensic analysis of the Stuxnet worm found the worm partially employed network mapping to target its attacks, focusing on isolated networks using memory sticks as the initial method of transmission. Once in, Stuxnet focused its attack on networks with programmable logic controllers (PLCs) of a specific type and caused uranium enrichment centrifuges to malfunction. The level of sophistication required to drill down to get to this level of detail to plan an attack is remarkable, particularly considering the complexity and number of overall systems and the air-gapped nature of the systems.\nNetwork mapping is both an offensive and defensive intelligence endeavor. To adequately prepare both the defensive and offensive battlespaces, an accurate picture of systems is needed. Arguably the dual domestic-foreign pictures are complementary and help avoid violating part 2.13 of Executive Order 12333, which prevents any covert action from influencing U.S. political processes, public opinion, policies, media, or various sections of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.\nNetwork mapping and monitoring is a double-edged sword. Legally network mapping can be considered CE, and therefore domestic network mapping by U.S. intelligence agencies without a warrant would be prohibited. However, network mapping is of critical importance to the maintenance of national security infrastructures. Thus far the intelligence community does not have a formal commitment from the White House or the Justice Department to engage in any domestic CE operations. Currently in the United States there is an uneasy and inefficient public-private commitment to providing information on network security across critical infrastructure. A thorough understanding of domestic and foreign networks assists in visualization for both offensive and defensive\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER SEVEN\npurposes, and effort to push reasoned analysis of threats has begun to make its way into Congress.⁴²\nNetwork mapping assists in the identification of network components. Once network components are known, it becomes necessary to explore vulnerabilities within systems. Most damaging are zero-day vulnerabilities, which are vulnerabilities in computer applications of which even system administrators are unaware. The Stuxnet attack exposed several zero-day vulnerabilities in the Windows software controlling/monitoring the programmable logic controllers, causing the attached centrifuges to spin outside of their safe operational standards.\nSystemic vulnerabilities necessitate a thorough understanding of the historical record of different types of attacks and exploits. The identification of zero-day vulnerabilities should lead network administrators to immediately patch these gaps. Intelligence plays a role in identifying what types of attacks have been used in the past and what vulnerabilities these attacks attempted to exploit. Historical accounting is important for both offensive and defensive preparation of the battlespace. For obvious reasons it is important to prevent repeat attacks on domestic systems; at the same time it is important not to engage in repeat attack methods once a vulnerability on an opposing system has been fixed. Such an attack would likely be ineffective and lead to anonymity-attribution problems.\nThe historical accounting of attack types by countries and substate actors also alerts operators within the intelligence and military community to the threat spectrum capabilities of a particular cyber adversary. Understanding the threat spectrum capabilities of states facilitates an accurate conceptualization of their power to operate within the domain. Table 7.3 is a representation of known threat spectrum capabilities.\nThe above areas of consideration within CE are only a small sampling of the overall tasking priorities for intelligence using CE methods. They hint at a broad applicability for CYBERINT methods in the preparation of the battlespace.\n# CONVENTIONAL INTELLIGENCE\nIntelligence collected on budgetary allocations, offensive and defensive cyber unit sizes, and training methodologies provides the clearest parallel to conventional intelligence. As in conventional intelligence, most countries are frequently unwilling to release data on absolute military expenditures or the sizes and force structures within their military. Military capabilities are a closely guarded secret in most countries. Capabilities are particularly secretive in the cyber domain. Often if cyber capabilities are exposed, they cease to be capabilities.⁴³ Once Stuxnet was discovered by the Iranians, defensive measures were taken to \"plug\" the holes the Stuxnet attack employed. This dramatically reduces\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nTABLE 7.3 Cyber Threat Spectrum\n|  Levels (Types) of Attack | Description | Feasibility | Complexity  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  Propaganda | The propagation of information via the Internet to affect public, private, or governmental opinion.

Whereas missiles can be launched with repeated success because the ability to defend against a moving projectile is difficult, a similar cyber weapon is more easily defended against once it has been identified. Antivirus software can be reprogrammed to identify and isolate repeat threats, and zero-day vulnerabilities can be patched.\nAn excellent example of an open source analysis of cyber capabilities comes from Stokes, Lin, and Hsiao, who examine in explicit detail the construction, location, leadership, and mission of many aspects of the Chinese People's Liberation Army information warfare programs.⁴⁴ Their report is an example of a high-value detailed analysis that could be supplemented by conventional intelligence to enhance policy-maker and combatant commander comprehension of the battlespace. The detailed analysis of the location and force structure can cause an enemy to shift its tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and make them less reliable. Alternatively, not revealing that information has been gained on TTPs can provide an offensive edge in cyber operations.\nThe implications for conventional intelligence collection methods indicate that intelligence on cyber does not necessarily need to remain cyberbound or exclusively within the realm of CE. Many metrics such as force size matter in cyber and can be examined to create a better assessment of potential adversaries. Cyber force size is particularly important from a malware development perspective. Complex coding scripts typically necessitate large numbers of programmers to develop and test the scripts. The ability for an individual to accomplish highly complex attacks is possible but less likely than a large cyber warfare unit working with the same objective.\nLikewise, knowing where a unit is located or how programmers were trained can help planners determine the best response to a particular attack, or how best to manipulate their organizational structure. Derek Clark and Kai Konrad refer to this as identifying the weakest link.⁴⁵ The identification of the weakest link is particularly important in cyber defense and offense. There are multiple fronts (systems) needing defense. All it takes is one \"best shot\" to achieve significant damage. While this weakest link can be identified through CE operations outlined in the previous section, it can also be identified within the training, command, and organizational structure of units charged with conducting or protecting against cyber attacks.\nClosely related to the conventional military metrics above, yet likely unique to the cyber domain, are public-private ICT collaborations. Although most countries have programs for military public and private collaborations with universities and businesses for research and development, within the cyber domain the importance of this relationship is magnified for multiple reasons. First, much of the training and education necessary to conduct offensive or defensive oper\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nThe Role of Intelligence in Cyberspace\nations within cyberspace can be learned at public institutions or can be crafted for private sector use. This extends far beyond the development of technology to the actual training of the warfighter, the development of the platforms upon which the domain rests, and more. Second, these collaborations spread out but do not diffuse potential vulnerabilities.\nBecause collaborations can form the foundational aspects of the cyber warriors within offensive and defensive units, they can train, equip, and prepare in ways far different from conventional military means. Most countries have a balance between civilian and military protection of their national cyber infrastructures based largely on the development of computer emergency response teams (CERTs). An intelligence assessment of the strength and quality of ICT collaborations is of critical importance in understanding the cyber battlespace.\nICT collaborations are not necessarily official and do not need to be highly structured and regimented. Alexander Klimburg provides evidence Russia and China have created groups of plausibly deniable cyber attackers. Creating an accurate open source measure of unofficial collaborations is difficult. An intelligence focus on unofficial collaborations with entities can contextualize cyber incidents such as the 2007 cyber attacks directed at Estonian governmental, bank, and communications websites. The attacks were motivated by a decision to move a Russian war memorial from central Tallinn. While initial reports indicated Russia was the culprit, Russia denied any participation in the cyber attacks. The reality is somewhat murkier and more akin to an unofficial sanction or condoning of cyber attacks by the Russian government.\nThe collection and production of intelligence on more conventional attributes of pertinence to the cyber domain is a role in which the intelligence community is likely already engaged. Occasionally reports on issues relating to this category of intelligence are published for public consumption. A recent report of this type was produced for the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission to examine China's capability to conduct cyber warfare and cyber exploitation. Knowledge of capabilities is still applicable to the cyber domain and is greatly influenced by conventional intelligence collection methods and subsequent analysis, which contextualizes the meaning of raw intelligence.\n## HUMINT AND CYBER\nHuman intelligence (HUMINT) stands out in cyber for two particular reasons. First, HUMINT agents can provide accurate internal information on systems and access to those systems unavailable through CE and other intelligence collection methods. Second, human assets can serve as a bridge between the external world and air-gapped or other forms of secure networks. As was indicated above, it is likely that the Stuxnet virus was distributed using a thumb drive,\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER SEVEN\nwhich needed to be inserted into a machine within an air-gapped network. HUMINT agents can serve as a vulnerability against which most network administrators will be unable to provide significant protection.\nThe role of a HUMINT asset with access to information on networks can be extremely damaging. Even if the agent is on a lightly classified network, the repercussions of his or her actions can be enormous. The scandal caused by Bradley Manning (now named Chelsea Manning) leaking more than 260,000 diplomatic cables to WikiLeaks in 2010 is illustrative of the problem posed by internal threats.⁵¹ Manning’s leak and the even more damaging 2013 document releases by Edward Snowden, a former employee of a contractor affiliated with both the NSA and CIA, highlight the potential damage a rogue employee can have on the ability of the intelligence community to keep information secret.⁵² Snowden’s insider collection and subsequent release of documents pertaining to the National Security Agency likely constitutes one of the most significant intelligence leaks of all time and resulted in an estimated 1.7 million documents being released in violation of U.S. classification law.⁵³ Moreover, unlike the leaks by Manning, the Snowden leaks revealed many of the TTPs used by the NSA in its intelligence operations in the cyber domain. These revelations have been extremely damaging and have resulted in changes in the way adversaries safeguard their cyber infrastructure.\nHUMINT threats need to be developed and enhanced for offensive intelligence and protected against for domestic national security counterintelligence. Gaining access to the technical schematics, documents, information, login procedures, or any of a multitude of other targets of intelligence a HUMINT asset could provide is a critical aspect added directly by intelligence to the understanding of the cyber domain. Furthermore, HUMINT agents are almost impossible to detect under normal circumstances as they can often engage in significant espionage while still easily performing the normal duties. Unlike the spy thriller days of old when agents had to sneak out of a building with classified documents in a folder or a box, they can often place thousands or millions of documents on a solid-state drive and easily conceal it upon exiting a facility. Many of these drives are smaller in size than a penny.\nBeyond the collection of intelligence from HUMINT sources, these insiders can assist in the implementation of cyber actions. Information within a 2005 report by the U.S. Secret Service in cooperation with Carnegie Mellon indicated that up to 29 percent of all attacks against a surveyed group of critical infrastructure stakeholders were initiated by insiders.⁵⁴ The majority of motivations behind these attacks were not related to intelligence or covert action. This, however, does not preclude the possibility of using insiders to affect or gain information or access on adversary systems. The recruitment and maintenance of insider threats by the intelligence community should be a top priority. These\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nThe Role of Intelligence in Cyberspace\nFIGURE 7.1 Timeline for Attack Implementation\nagents can offer a mission a critical component, often during times when more lengthy intelligence collection processes are constrained by events.\n# TIME FOR ATTACK RECOGNITION, COMPLETION, AND ATTRIBUTION\nAttack recognition and attribution are also critical for both a defensive and offensive battlespace planning. All of the intelligence collection methods and the focus of the intel process of trying to comprehend the cyber domain culminate in understanding, from a mission critical orientation, the progression of cyber attacks. Figure 7.1 is a simplified model for understanding attack planning and progression within a battlespace modeled loosely on the JP 3-51 electronic warfare-planning model. This model is informed by intelligence collection. Line one of the figure indicates a policy-maker's perspective on the process of engaging in conflict. A conflict initiation is (o) planned, (1) implemented, and (2) completed. Policy-makers want to know what resources any given action will take and how long it will take to complete it. In cyber a more accurate timeline for action in cyberspace requires (o) intelligence collection, (1) operational planning of the attack with an informed knowledge of the battlespace, (2) understanding of the time it takes for the attack to be completed, (3) how long until the attack is recognized as an attack by the adversary, (4) how long until that adversary can do something about the attack, (5) how long until the adversary assigns attribution for the attack. The ordering of the items listed above greatly affects the ability for an attack to be conducted successfully. Intelligence informs the policy-maker and commander as to the feasibility of a particular type of attack and the probability of success. If recognition of an attack occurs early in the timeline of events the probability of success is diminished.\nThe timeline can be tested in much the same way conventional weapons are tested. It would be absurd to send a bomber over a potential target with a completely untested bomb, or to send a soldier into battle with an untested model of rifle. Just as weapons are tested in the physical world, they need to be tested in the cyber domain as well. This testing provides added information to both\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER SEVEN\nFIGURE 7.2 The Influence of Intelligence on Cyber Operations\nModified from E. Waltz, Information Warfare.\nthe policy-maker and the combatant commander as to the effectiveness of the weapon and the timeline of events above. If a cyber weapon is slow and easily detectable, its probability for success is diminished. This lowered probability for success does not nullify its use but does condition it.\nOne aspect of this phase of IPB is that it is extremely beneficial to both the offensive and defensive strategic and tactical operations. By planning and testing potential attacks against theoretical adversarial systems, the intelligence community provides an out-of-the-box perspective necessary to prevent similar attacks against domestic targets. This logic would indicate an attempt to use a worm like Stuxnet against the U.S. infrastructure would run into greater problems than if the weapon had been developed first elsewhere.\n# IPB AND ITS IMPACT ON CYBER\nThe role of intelligence in cyber is not dissimilar from its role in the conventional domains. There are new areas in which collection and analysis need to occur, yet its overall objective remains the same. Returning to Edward Waltz's concept of information preparation of the battlefield, figure 7.2 illustrates intelligence's influence on operations originating within the cyber domain. The role of intelligence in cyber is to accurately facilitate an understanding of those\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nThe Role of Intelligence in Cyberspace\nentities and the possible tools by which to influence them. The cyber domain is surrounded with hype and hysteria. Many of the claims are accurately based in reality. But the known unknowns are still enormous within this evolving domain, and it is incumbent on intelligence to provide an accurate assessment of the current state of affairs.\nAll-source intelligence for cyber operations requires the intelligence community to think beyond domestic system defense. The focus should be balanced between foreign and domestic intelligence, thereby mutually informing one another and creating a systemic defense for national assets in addition to better facilitating decision-makers with a more accurate picture of how a potential cyber attack might succeed or fail.\n# CYBER AS COVERT ACTION\nTo further define the role of intelligence in cyber, it is necessary to look more deeply into the laws codifying the conduct of the intelligence community. All of the above sections provide a framework for defining the role of intelligence with regard to IPB. Cyber conflict is, by its very nature, covert. Even if an attack is discovered, it is often unattributable. Attacks can be designed to go unnoticed and affect changes to systems and their components for days, weeks, or months without detection. Even in instances where groups such as Anonymous publically take credit for attacks, responsibility is typically claimed post hoc. Nearly all examples of state-on-state cyber attacks have been covert.\nThe covert nature of cyber brings full circle Warner's definition of intelligence as attempting to influence. Covert action is a secret operation to influence a foreign entity. At least in theory, most, if not all, cyber attacks begin covertly. Section 1.7(a)(4) of Executive Order 12333 regarding intelligence activities describes covert action:\nConduct convert action activities approved by the President. No agency except the Central Intelligence Agency (or the Armed Forces of the United States in time of war declared by the Congress or during any period covered by a report from the President to the Congress consistent with the War Powers Resolution, Public Law 93-148) may conduct any covert action activity unless the President determines that another agency is more likely to achieve a particular objective.\nEvident in the early structuring of the governmental approach to cyberspace is the categorization of cyber operations as covert actions. The Department of Defense originally took the lead with General Keith Alexander as the head of both NSA and Cyber Command, a path that has continued now that Admiral Michael Rogers has taken over as the head of both organizations. This indicates the president has established an agency other than the Central Intelligence\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER SEVEN\nAgency as the primary covert operator within this domain. While the logic behind having a military intelligence organization commander and an organizational structure that falls under the U.S. Strategic Command (STRATCOM) runs counter to EO 12333, the institutional capacity of the DoD in the technical domain and the scale of the problem being faced within this new domain make the assignment appropriate.\n# SUMMARIZING THE ROLE OF INTELLIGENCE WITHIN THE CYBER DOMAIN\nIn defining the role of intelligence within the cyber domain, it is necessary to take a holistic approach. From a collection perspective, the intelligence community should be and has been working in coordination with a hybrid push-and-pull intelligence cycle to both elevate the importance of this domain and facilitate collection within it. The emphasis has been heavily defensive up to this point and largely focused on countering threats rather than anticipating them. This needs to change, and the only way this can change is if the intelligence community begins to actively turn its sights on adversaries and develop more rigorous all-source intelligence combining novel CYBERINT technologies to augment reporting on this domain. Parroting Amoroso's assertion, cyber should be included on the daily intelligence briefs of policy-makers. The inclusion would likely start the process of demystification of this immensely complicated domain.\nCyberspace is a domain that can be used to fulfill all aspects of Warner's definition of intelligence to some degree. It is a domain in which it is possible to gain understanding about other states beyond and within the domain itself, but it is also a domain that can influence other states' policy decisions as well as perceptions. In particular, accurate intelligence on both sides of the domestic-foreign divide can mutually inform decision-makers about vulnerabilities and the eventual decision to use cyber as an offensive weapon or how best to defend against attacks. Moreover, intelligence can rein in the debate on cyber to a more realistic area of operations predicated on sound estimates rather than on grandiose speculation.\nThe intelligence community itself commonly is the point of origin for OCOs emanating from the cyber domain and will likely serve as a force multiplier in instances where a combined conventional cyber attack is necessary. To engage in cyber conflict, just as in conventional conflict, intelligence is needed to prepare the battlespace and facilitate an accurate assessment of the probability for success and utility for any type of operation. This preparation hones the weapons, decisions, and effect of a potential operation. More importantly for national security, a thorough and accurate preparation of both the foreign and domestic battlespaces will serve to inform and enhance cyber security.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms"

Intelligence is increasingly facilitating information superiority through an understanding of the cyber domain. The Department of Defense's \"Joint Vision 2020\" establishes the goal of information superiority on the battlefield. This information superiority enables decision superiority and favorably tilts the strategic and tactical balance. Information superiority is built on cyber power, scale and complexity of attacks, robustness of defense, policy positions, systemic vulnerabilities and dependencies, and actor anonymity and attribution issues. Intelligence plays a mission critical role in assessing these characteristics. The discussion below examines the role of intelligence in identifying these characteristics within the cyber domain and examines how it influences the decision-making of policy-makers. Specifically the focus hones in on how intelligence increases the effectiveness of identifying potential attackers within the cyber domain and informs the decision-making of policy-makers when engaging in covert cyber action directed against a potential adversary. The discussion is designed to serve as a strategic framework in which to understand the role of intelligence within the cyber domain.\nIs it really necessary to examine the role of intelligence within the cyber domain as contextually different than in a conventional domain? The short answer is yes. Cyber necessitates independent examination because it is characteristically different, and yet at the same time it is a pervasive feature affecting outcomes within other domains. What differentiates cyber from land, sea, air, and space are three fundamental attributes relevant to intelligence practitioners. First, the cyber domain is a man-made domain. Second, military capabilities across the other domains are managed through the cyber domain. Third, military and civilian aspects of the cyber domain are often intertwined and difficult to differentiate. These attributes pose unique opportunities and problems for intelligence officials.\nThe man-made nature of the cyber domain makes it a largely virtual domain with its value corresponding to the speed and volume of information contained\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER SEVEN\nwithin it. However, the cyber domain is not entirely virtual and has numerous real-world connection points to everything from industrial control systems of power and water management facilities to the weapon systems of drones flying above distant battlefields.\nCyberspace is not tangible in the same way as more conventional domains and therefore necessitates a new form of dynamic intelligence evolving from all-source collection of conventional and novel intelligence sources. A recent National Research Council report states that intelligence in the cyber domain is useful for both strategic and tactical purposes.¹ The strategic and tactical importance of intelligence's role in influencing the cyber domain falls within the concept of all-source intelligence. Loch Johnson defines all-source intelligence as one of the fundamental propositions of a theory of strategic intelligence.² More importantly for the purposes of understanding the operational and political environments within which offensive and defensive actions in cyberspace can occur, it is necessary to understand what intelligence is within decisions regarding the cyber domain and how intelligence influences those decisions.\n## DEFINING INTELLIGENCE\nThere are dozens of different definitions of intelligence, each of which is in some way applicable to understanding cyber action. One of the more succinct and conceptually ordered comes from Michael Warner, who defines intelligence as a \"secret, state activity to understand or influence foreign entities.\"³ His definition establishes the fundamental premises of both collection and analysis, while including actions designed to influence. Intelligence is vital to the cyber domain because foreign entities are increasingly storing, managing, and directing their governmental, public, private, and military functions in a digitized world.\nThe traditional intelligence collection types (INTs) are still of immense value, yet they must be combined with aspects of the digitized target spectrum to provide a holistic view of both threats and opportunities. At present the majority of studies in the public domain have focused on defense.⁴ This defensive posture is made clear by General Keith Alexander, the director of the National Security Agency and commander of United States Cyber Command, when he writes: \"US Cyber Command's efforts and planning aim to ensure that the DoD has done all it can to defend and deter determined adversaries, mitigate dangerous threats, and address nagging vulnerabilities, so that even our most capable opponents will know that interfering with our nation's equities in cyberspace is a losing proposition.\"⁵\nThis defensive and deterrent-reliant posture is limiting and prone to inadequacies. Echoing Machiavelli and to some extent Sun Tzu, the adage \"the best defense is a good offense\" offers a novel way of considering action and intelli\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nThe Role of Intelligence in Cyberspace [103]\ngence within cyber. More accurately, it allows for a systematic approach to both national cyber defensive and offensive resource allocations. Beyond the efficiency argument for shifting the focus from solely defense to a balance between defense and offense, intelligence collection can help to inform offensive strategies and the decision to use cyber as a weapon. The role of intelligence within cyber becomes increasingly important when considering the difficulty of achieving any significant measure of deterrence within the cyber domain.⁶\nThe defensive orientation of the majority of cyber literature has a constraining effect on decision-making processes for the use of offensive cyber weapons. This defensive focus is largely due to both the alarmist calls of some scholars and policy-makers and an information communications technologies industry orientation offering many more strategies for defense than for offense. While I do not dispute the need for defense, this defensive focus leads the national security establishment down a path of attempting to create an impenetrable system. If there is one thing that is abundantly clear in the cyber domain it is that the only impenetrable system is the one that has not been made. Cyber is based on physics and algorithms. The mathematics and science behind security measures can be immensely complex and take massive computing power to penetrate, but that does not make them impenetrable. Even the most robust systems secured with checks and encryptions are still highly vulnerable to their users' ignorance or malice, as was the case with Edward Snowden in 2013.\nInstead of focusing on a solely carte blanche defensive posture toward cyber security, intelligence can provide both an offensive and defensive picture more effective at safeguarding national security. Taking a step back from the conventional cyber security literature, intelligence can direct cyber security efforts to not merely safeguard national security but also provide an offensive tool for use against other states. The vast literature on intelligence, ranging from the way intelligence influences the policy-making process to how it helps to understand aspects of the development of utility for actions, serves as a guide in defining the role of intelligence within the cyber domain.\nReflecting on Warner's definition of intelligence, the spectrum of intelligence collection methods—from human intelligence (HUMINT) to the more technical collection methods of signals intelligence (SIGINT), measurement and signatures intelligence (MASINT), geospatial intelligence (GEOINT), and open source intelligence (OSINT)—works together in an all-source environment to provide an accurate understanding of foreign entities. (Table 7.1 provides a quick definitional reference for the various intelligence collection types.) The understanding provided by intelligence has largely focused on the conventional domains and on political decision-making. However, as decisions in conventional domains increasingly migrate toward cyberspace, and the systems controlling the tools used in these domains increasingly become digitally connected, the\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER SEVEN\nTABLE 7.1 Intelligence Collection Methods\n|  Intelligence Source Type | Definition  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  Open Source (OSINT) | Overtly available information found, selected, and acquired from publicly available source.  |\n|  Measurement and Signatures (MASINT) | Intelligence detected and classified from targets that identify or describe signatures (distinctive characteristics) of fixed or dynamic target sources.  |\n|  Human (HUMINT) | Intelligence collected through interpersonal contact via human collection officers.  |\n|  Geospatial (GEOINT)* | The exploitation and analysis of imagery and geospatial information to describe, assess, and visually depict physical features and geographically referenced activities on the earth.

Williams, Shimeal, and Dunlevy, \"Intelligence Analysis for Internet Security.\" CYBERINT is considered independent of traditional SIGINT. However, as in many of the other types of intelligence collection, techniques and agencies often overlap.\nimportance of understanding the technical schematics and decision processes becomes vital to national security.\nNick Cullather, in an article on digital connections on the battlefield, indicates significant advances in the development of network-centric warfare. Cullather notes that the rise of a \"revolution in military affairs\" has largely not been matched by the intelligence community's ability to keep up.[7] This is of particular importance when looking beyond the network-centric battlefield of conventional weapons to the new zone of confrontation within cyberspace itself. Similarly, Michael Herman finds that counterterrorism intelligence analysis requires a broad spectrum of information sources brought together.[8] ICT facilitates the mitigation of \"stovepipes\" and increases the efficiency in information transference.[9] Information transmission has also been facilitated following the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 by the creation of \"fusion centers.\"[10] ICT has a role to play not only in the conduct of war on the battlefield, but also in the management of a conventional traditional threat spectrum within the fusion centers and beyond in the wider intelligence community.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nThe Role of Intelligence in Cyberspace [105]\nTerrorism is not commonly regarded as part of the conventional threat spectrum, yet in reality most terrorist acts take place in the physical world and require bombs and guns. However, the information coordination necessary to organize, plan, and conduct warfare, terrorist acts, and political strategies has largely shifted to cyberspace. The 2008 Mumbai terrorist attacks are a poignant example of terrorists leveraging technology and open source intelligence collected from public sites and software such as Google Earth to plan and orchestrate mass murder.[11] As horrific as the use of digital tools for planning attacks is, it is not isolated to open source intelligence collection via tools. Terrorists also use open source cryptography and crypto-currencies to finance their operations.[12] Intelligence agencies are in a competition with other states and organizations to leverage tools effectively to prevent attacks by terrorists and to mitigate international incidents before they arise.\nWhile open source research is fundamentally more powerful than ever before, available open source information provides only a limited aperture to realistically size up threats and targets within cyberspace itself. The problem of intelligence in cyberspace is massive both in terms of scale and complexity of data. Joel Brenner, a former inspector general of the National Security Agency and head of U.S. counterintelligence, indicated there has been an enormous threat emanating from within cyberspace that is not being adequately addressed.[13]\nModern warfare, command and control warfare (C2W), is network centric. Large swaths of the national critical infrastructures in states that pose conventional security and economic threats to the United States are controlled by digital systems. The literature is less focused on the need for understanding these vulnerabilities than it is on safeguarding them. The defensive focus, to a large degree, overshadows the development of offensive capabilities.\nPhil Williams, Timothy Shimeal, and Casey Dunlevy make a well-reasoned case arguing for focused intelligence efforts on identifying threats to national cyber security.[14] These authors make a valid point that needs to be addressed and is being addressed by several national strategy documents on the topic, including the National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace and the \"International Strategy for Cyberspace.\" One report of particular importance addressing many of the issues brought up by Williams, Shimeal, and Dunlevy is the October 2011 report by the Office of the National Counterintelligence Executive on cyber espionage.[15] A broad spectrum of federal strategies and reports has made identification and protection against vulnerabilities a top priority. More recently the president of the United States under Executive Order 13636 in February 2013 directed the government to begin actively seeking out and planning strategies to mitigate cyber threats to national critical infrastructure.\nThis is a process that is under way and includes an alphabet soup of agencies from across the civilian and military spectrum of the government. A re\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER SEVEN\ncurrent problem that keeps cropping up in many of the discussions on critical infrastructure is network awareness. Many companies and firms affiliated with critical infrastructure do not have an adequate understanding of their own vulnerabilities, let alone how they interact to create systemic threats. One industry based on personal communications and working experience that seems to be working very hard to address these issues is the U.S. financial sector, which in many ways is pioneering cyber security efforts under E.O. 13636.\nCurrently most cyber security is based on attacks or incidents in progress or that have already occurred. It is difficult, if not impossible, to defend against an unknown attack. Much of the effort in the United States cyber community now seems to be equivalent to plugging the holes in the dike after it floods. It is a fact that most cyber attacks are repeat attacks originating at the lower end of the threat spectrum, making the strategy of filling holes in the dike an absolute necessity in an effort to prevent repeat intrusions from identical or similar malware types. Yet this post hoc strategy largely fails to address the more serious problem of accurately anticipating what the next type of attack is going to be. This strategy, best referred to as a \"Maginot Line\" strategy, is prone to failure in areas where technological and strategic capabilities rapidly evolve. The real challenge is to develop intelligence-based approaches to cyberspace that prevent future attacks before they happen.\nThere is a significant and sustained effort underway on the defensive side of the cyber debate within the DoD to develop better security. The DoD is currently employing at least three categories of defensive teams to facilitate DoD network protection: DoD information network operations teams (DoDIN Ops), defensive cyber operations—internal defensive measures teams (DCO-IDM or cyber protection teams), and defensive cyber operations—response action teams (DCO-RA or national mission teams).[16] Yet all of these teams are heavily reliant on intelligence on the cyber environment for defense (ICE-D). The teams that fit into these categories are tasked with segments of the overall problem. While the DoDIN-Ops teams are tasked with ensuring sustained secure operations on DoD networks, they are not focused on adversary behaviors in those networks. Their work is informed by adversary behaviors but seeks to maintain network security in aggregate. DCO-IDM or cyber protection teams function as hunter killers within the network. They are tasked with seeking out individuals engaging DoD networks illegally and stopping the attacks or exploits. DCO-RA or national mission teams are tasked with responding to adversary behavior in DoD networks. As should be readily apparent, the problem is enormous and relies on intelligence for all aspects of ICE-D functions. The DoD network environment alone is composed of millions of computing devices and users.\nBecause we exist in a world of known unknowns and unknown unknowns, to paraphrase Secretary Rumsfeld, cyber security is likely the former rather than\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nThe Role of Intelligence in Cyberspace [107]\nthe latter.¹⁷ How can intelligence be used to improve the cyber security situation not only to protect the national infrastructure in a more systematic and logical manner but also to use this information to inform the decision-making processes of policy-makers?\nOne problem associated with the U.S. cyber community is proximity. Because the community develops, tests, and employs its own tools, it is unable to take into account methods of testing that have not yet threatened systems in the past. This is an in-the-box, out-of-the-box, forget-the-box problem. The designers of systems, software, and networks are talented and smart individuals; they lead the world in technical innovation, yet because they are inside their own systems, it becomes it intrinsically difficult to isolate unforeseen problems. United States Cyber Command and various other teams from the services and the various academies have tried to address this problem by creating competitive cyber teams that compete with one other and against civilian competitors in various challenges such as DefCon capture the flag contests and others. These various DCO and DoDIN-Ops teams also engage one another to consistently foster novel thinking on security.\nYet the challenge is immense, and solutions are best achieved by constant introspection. Below are several proposed strategies to help facilitate the development of improved defensive operations. First, the current orientation toward plugging holes must continue. While this post hoc process is frustrating, it prevents or at least slows further intrusions. The mentality of these DoDIN-Ops is one of defense. The objective is to secure and defend systems against all possible or known types of attacks. The most realistic approach is to defend against known types of attacks. The systems become fortified against repeat incidents or at least can minimize their severity. The work of these teams is not sexy; it is not offense oriented; it is a process of continuous network security development. Second, DCO-IDM teams must also actively hunt in government and defense networks for potential adversaries and leverage information gained through all source intelligence collection and communication with DoDIN-Ops, DCO-RA, and OCO teams to anticipate potential blind spots. These teams must also be regularly rotated to provide them time to think like attackers. Third, DCO-RA teams must leverage all-source intelligence and continuous communications with DCO-IDM and OCO teams to engage adversaries in a defensive posture on foreign networks before they endanger DoD networks. While these teams are in the process of getting organized and established, it is important that these teams have clear interteam communications to mitigate stovepiping. The co-location or consistent rotation of team members would likely facilitate enhanced operational results. The co-location and coordination of members within a team should be of paramount importance as it allows analysts and technicians the opportunity to collaborate and developed a detailed and synergistic understanding of capabilities.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER SEVEN\nThe wider intelligence community must use all-source methods to collect as much intelligence on potential opponents as possible. This means profiling every aspect of other nations' cyber offensive and defensive capabilities. This requires a robust all-source collection methodology. Signals intelligence must look for transmissions and communications as well as spikes in Internet traffic and geo-locate them using IP addresses. These geo-located IP addresses need to be analyzed using satellites and drones to provide accurate geospatial information on the areas in question. Open source intelligence collection should attempt to gain as much publicly available information as possible on areas of interest through legal means. Once all of this information has been compiled and assessed, targeted HUMINT operations should begin working on developing assets within these areas or with connections to these areas. These agents should be recruited for multiple purposes. First, they should be used to secure intelligence on the capabilities of potential adversaries. These capabilities are defined in more detail below. Second, agents should also be recruited to become potential insider threats, a tool of particular importance on air-gapped systems.[18] Third, intelligence agencies should also place an emphasis on cyber exploitation (CE) and attempt to probe and map out network infrastructures, vulnerabilities, and strengths of adversaries. The last point is of importance both from an offensive and defensive strategic orientation.\nAnother major problem with the cyber domain arises out of its systemic complexity. As Williams, Shimeal, and Dunlevy accurately note, cyber defenders often do not have a realistic or accurate picture of their own systems, let alone the systems of adversaries who are attacking them.[19] Following their recommendations, the national security community would be prudent to make use of the principle of knowing yourself. This requires a consistent focus on domestic systems. However, only focusing on domestic systems leads to the \"Maginot Line\" tendency in which it is assumed networks are created to be impenetrable.\n# INTELLIGENCE AND THE CYBER BATTLESPACE\nThe cyber domain is a modern battlespace and necessitates a holistic understanding. To defend against or engage in offensive actions, it is necessary to have an accurate understanding of the operational environment. According to Edward Waltz, any battlespace, whether offensive or defensive, requires a combination of dominant battlespace awareness (DBA) and dominant battlespace knowledge (DBK).[20] The process of identifying what is and is not important to understanding a particular battlespace largely falls to the discretion of policy-makers within the intelligence cycle.\nIn writing about intelligence and decision-making, Stephen Marrin states: \"the intelligence cycle starts with decision-maker information requirements lev\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nThe Role of Intelligence in Cyberspace [109]\nied on intelligence collection capabilities, the processing of collected raw intelligence and transmission of this processed material to analysts who decipher its meaning, and relay that understanding back to the decision-makers.”²¹\nThe decision-maker engages in tasking through a number of different “pull” mechanisms including governmental reports, hearings before Congress, presidential directives, and executive orders. These tasking methods and others combine to facilitate within the intelligence community an accurate understanding of what constitutes the battlespace in the eyes of the policy-maker. Often the planning and direction can be informal requests from the executive or from Congress, and at other times it can come from official strategy documents.\nPrior to 9/11, terrorism was a priority, but the planning and direction of resources had not yet reached a critical mass sufficient to prevent the terrible attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Marrin and others find the intelligence process frequently fails to adequately define what constitutes a tasking priority for the intelligence community, necessitating a “push” from within the community outward. There are many instances in which policy-makers ignore, misinterpret, or misuse intelligence despite adequate tasking and intelligence production and dissemination.²²\nThe push mechanism of the intelligence community can happen in several ways. Often it can follow what constructivists call “norm entrepreneurs.” Entrepreneurs in the cyber domain include Richard Clarke, or John Arquilla and David Ronfeldt, among others.²³ These individuals bring to national policymakers’ attention issues of importance and help direct the intelligence community’s efforts. If, however, they make outlandish claims and statements, their push for new norms can have a backlash and inspire counter-entrepreneurs such as Thomas Rid, who writes that cyber war does not and will not occur.²⁴ Most traditional intelligence push comes from within the intelligence community itself.²⁵ Because the intelligence community is pushing intelligence not requested by the decision-makers, the concept of the intelligence cycle can, as Marrin notes, become linear.²⁶\nBecause the domain is so complex, it is beneficial for the president and policy-makers to have individuals with the requisite understanding of the domain not only in policy and legal terms but also in technical terms. The position currently established is known as the cyber czar. While this position is typically filled by someone with policy or legal expertise, it is beneficial for that individual to have a wide background and a reasonable technical understanding so he or she can facilitate complex discussions. Former cyber czar Melissa Hathaway would be a prime example of the type of individual who could accurately convey the complexity of the technical and historical attributes of interactions in the domain while at the same time have a firm grasp on the policy and legal implications of future actions. This person then sits at the choke point of the\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER SEVEN\npush and pull on the cyber domain and distills the information into a balanced reality applicable for decision-makers.\nFor intelligence to adequately focus its sights on any battlespace, planning and direction from policy-makers must occur. Once policy-makers have established the importance of a battlespace, the intelligence community must find ways to deliver accurate and reliable intelligence. The objective of intelligence collection is not solely to provide real-time information on the battlespace; rather, it is best thought of as battlespace preparation or what Waltz refers to as \"intelligence preparation of the battlespace\" (IPB).[27] Although Waltz specifically refers to IPB in the context of coordinated conventional warfare and the use of information operations in network-centric warfare, the theoretical principles apply across all domains. IPB, according to Waltz, includes providing an understanding of the \"physical, political, electronic, cyber, and other dimensions of the battlespace.\"[28] Alan D. Campen and Douglas H. Dearth reiterate the concept of IPB in Cyberwar 3.0. They state that information warfare requires an accurate knowledge of the battlespace as well as real-time awareness of situations within the battlespace as they arise.\nBefore moving directly into how each collection type can add to a holistic picture of the battlespace, it is necessary to define what constitutes the battlespace in the cyber domain. The battlespace, according to Waltz, constitutes \"all decision-relevant elements within a defined battlespace, and the ability to predict with very high confidence near-term enemy actions and outcomes.\"[29] More specifically this requires an understanding of human, material, and technical capabilities and the relationship of these capabilities within themselves and to other aspects of the operational environment. It is also important to understand the political implications of alterations in capabilities and the environment over time. A battlespace for cyber can be domestic or foreign and is considered to constitute three basic layers: physical, logical, and social layers. Intelligence must inform policy-makers on all three categories.\nThe physical layer is composed of a geographical location and the physical devices that constitute the environment. These devices can include hardware such as computers, switches, and routers. The devices that compose the physical layer can also include computing devices such as mobile phones, cars, airplanes, and ships. The physical layer also includes those devices used to facilitate cyber actions such as transoceanic cables, power stations, and buildings. Knowing the physical attributes of a target is often important when attempting to create cyber-kinetic responses. The physical structure of a network can provide clues as to the purpose of the network or point to vulnerabilities of constituent components of a network.\nBuilt upon the physical layer is a logical layer, which makes many of the aspects of the physical layer function. Firmware and software combine to form\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nThe Role of Intelligence in Cyberspace [111]\na logical layer. Just as there are numerous components to the physical layer there are hundreds if not thousands of different software and firmware applications that combine to make cyberspace function. When targeting a system it is often necessary to have intelligence on the attributes of the system being attacked. A piece of malware designed for a Windows 7 OS zero-day vulnerability will not work if that malware is deployed to a computer running Mac OS X Yosemite.\nLastly, the combination of the physical and the logical layers make the social layer possible. Even if the network and the software layers are air-gapped and highly secure, the social layer, the layer where people interact with the computing device, can still offer up vulnerabilities, as was illustrated in the Stuxnet incident. Knowing who is using a device and how they perceive and interact with the world around them can open up a variety of vulnerabilities including social engineering and phishing. The social layer is composed of both the actual people and personalities using the computing devices and the cyber persona of the individual using a platform.\nAggregating outward, the layers of cyberspace and their attributes in the vernacular of international relations constitute capabilities. Capabilities can be broadly defined as including mechanisms of offensive and defensive military strength such as size and number of offensive cyber units. Capabilities can include doctrinal measures or indicators such as official cyber security and warfare doctrines and can include the size and complexity of systems and their connections to other systems of importance. And capabilities can include technical capabilities such as programming skill within the environment.\nThe capabilities matrix included below is overly simplified, yet it indicates a host of areas where the intelligence community can provide significant assistance to decision-makers. What is important to consider is that these capabilities are not limited to the United States or its allies. Capabilities need to be assessed on a nation-by-nation basis and on a substate basis as well. These and many other unmentioned cyber capabilities combine to provide an accurate picture of the battlespace.\nIdentifying the capabilities and political situation of a new battlespace is difficult under the best of circumstances. Cyber is immensely complicated and therefore necessitates a logical template within which to examine capabilities. There is a need for a differentiation between the domestic (defensive) and the foreign (offensive) battlespace. This distinction is important both for tasking and decision-making. When the two battlespaces are separated, they are able to inform one another. Table 7.2 highlights many of the primary areas for consideration within the two battlespaces necessary for DBA and DBK.\nThe INTs above can and should be focused on these and related areas within the cyber domain. A holistic picture of the above components of the domain will\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER SEVEN\nTABLE 7.2 Components of Cyber DBA and DBK\n|  Domestic (Defense Oriented) | Foreign (Offense Oriented)  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  Policy considerations (offensive & defensive) | Policy considerations (offensive & defensive)  |\n|  Domestic network mapping | Foreign network mapping  |\n|  Budget allocations | Budget allocations  |\n|  ICT collaboration (alliances, partnerships) | Offensive unit size & training  |\n|  Defensive unit size & training | Defensive unit size & training  |\n|  Critical infrastructure | Critical infrastructure  |\n|  Insider threats for defensive purposes | Insider threats for offensive purposes  |\n|  Threat spectrum capabilities | Historical record of attack and defense  |\n|  Known vulnerabilities | Threat spectrum capabilities  |\n|  Time to attack recognition | Known vulnerabilities  |\n|  Time to attack attribution | ICT collaborations (alliances, partnerships)  |\n|  Systemic dependencies | Time to attack recognition  |\n|  Monitoring | Time to attack attribution  |\n|   | Systemic dependencies  |\n|   | Surveillance  |\n|   | Reconnaissance  |\nprovide decision-makers with a clearer visualization of the battlespace. Again, following Waltz, a visualization of any battlespace includes the following:\n\nEdward Amoroso argues the intelligence community should focus on creating an addition to the conventional intelligence briefs that consist solely of information pertaining to cyber.[31] Amoroso indicates such a report should focus on current security posture, top and new security risks, automated metrics, and human interpretation. Amoroso's case for the creation of a cyber-specific intelligence brief is sound and works toward promoting an accurate and realistic understanding of the threats and opportunities within this new and evolving domain relevant to national security.\n# POLICY CONSIDERATIONS\nThe Joint Chiefs of Staff have placed an increasing emphasis on the cyber domain within various joint doctrine publications. Joint doctrines provide insight into the needs of the services and policy-makers in the employment of and defense against cyber attacks. Documents also include many of the ways cyber\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nThe Role of Intelligence in Cyberspace [113]\nhas come to rely heavily on intelligence assets. Information superiority has become a mission critical aspect of defending national security. The Department of Defense's \"Joint Doctrine for Command and Control Warfare\" dating back to 1996 highlights the importance of intelligence products in support of C2W. The document indicates the use of intelligence assists in the conceptualization of all aspects of a battlespace.\nComprehension of any battlespace, including the cyber domain, requires understanding the policy environment in which an action occurs. Is there a national cyber defense strategy within the targeted country? How have they publicly or privately declared they would respond to hostile acts within the cyber domain? An example of the policy environment can be found in the \"Department of Defense Strategy for Operating in Cyberspace.\" The strategy outlines five strategic initiatives in its declassified report:\nStrategic Initiative 1: Treat cyberspace as an operational domain to organize, train, and equip so that DoD can take full advantage of cyberspace's potential\nStrategic Initiative 2: Employ new defense operating concepts to protect DoD networks and systems\nStrategic Initiative 3: Partner with other U.S. government departments and agencies and the private sector to enable a whole-of-government cyber security strategy\nStrategic Initiative 4: Build robust relationships with U.S. allies and international partners to strengthen collective cyber security\nStrategic Initiative 5: Leverage the nation's ingenuity through an exceptional cyber workforce and rapid technological innovation\nThe recently declassified sections of the report cited in the media indicate a doctrinal shift in the way the DoD approaches the cyber domain. The Wall Street Journal reports that DoD sources as early as 2011 indicated that some instances of cyber attacks can constitute an act of war.[32] This has further developed as recently as September 2014 with the NATO pledge for mutual defense in the event of significant cyber attacks that might result in the invocation of Article 5.[33] When asked what constitutes an act of war in cyberspace that would rise to a level that would result in the successful invocation of Article 5 for mutual defense, NATO secretary general Rasmussen said that the goal was to achieve \"strategic ambiguity\" to keep adversaries guessing and to act as \"ambiguous deterrence.\"[34]\nAlthough the current position on what constitutes an act of war in cyberspace within the eyes of the United States and NATO remains uncertain, understanding the policy positions within the domestic battlespace and in the foreign battlespace helps alleviate information asymmetries and establish clearly identifiable patterns for response. Whether it is the knowledge that Germany and the Netherlands both have official cyber security doctrines or that China has begun implementing a policy of making offensive cyber capabilities a strategic priority,\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER SEVEN\nthe overt and covert collection of policy positions provides policy-makers with a foundation for understanding intelligence related to cyber.\nPolicy platforms also help to codify international law, to create zones of norms or an identifiable policy framework in which states will interact or respond to incidents emanating from cyberspace.³⁵ While both the United States and Russia have made known a cyber attack could constitute an act of war, there has been little elaboration on specific characteristics of such an attack within the official policy-making circles of government. Often states will intentionally leave room for policy ambiguity as a mechanism of deterrence.³⁶ Understanding ambiguity, information gaps, and information asymmetry is crucial particularly in comprehending how leaders arrive at decisions. As in conventional warfare, in cyber conflict the minimization of or the knowledge about what a potential adversary will do in a given situation provides a strategic edge. Although there has been little in the form of codified policy delineation on what level of cyber attack would constitute an act of war, the academic community has been heavily engaged in attempting to apply existing legal frameworks to the cyber domain. The most notable work in this arena is the Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare, which works through in rigorous detail how actions within cyberspace could fall within existing international law.³⁷ Yet as rigorous as the work is, there is no single government required to adhere to its findings on the applicability of international law, and even within the laws themselves there was a significant amount of debate as to what constituted various levels of action in cyberspace. Instead of thinking of sponsored academic works such as the Tallinn Manual as clear policies to which states should adhere, they should be instead thought of as roadmaps to guide states in developing policies.\n# CE—NETWORK MAPPING, SYSTEMIC DEPENDENCIES, AND HISTORICAL RECORDS\nUnderstanding the policy environment both domestically and among foreign adversaries is only part of the larger intelligence process. Cyber exploitation (CE) constitutes a series of technological and analytical approaches to cyber-specific espionage. CE for the purposes of conventional intelligence collection can include the penetration of foreign networks to secure information on weapons systems, policy positions, and much more. CE is invasive yet does not disrupt, deny, or destroy data; it collects data. When CE operations focus intelligence on the cyber domain for offensive and defensive purposes, the objective is to understand the systems themselves. The goal becomes identifying the strengths and weaknesses of systems, the connectivity of systems to points of interests, and the interaction of those systems with strategic and tactical objectives.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nThe Role of Intelligence in Cyberspace [115]\nThere are numerous methods of CE; for the purposes of simplicity only a few are examined here. Network mapping is a form of CE that studies the physical connectivity of networks or the availability of insecure ports. This type of mapping provides information on what types of systems and servers operate on different networks and identifies the characteristics of the various component parts these systems constitute. Network mapping can drill down to very low levels on particular networks and provide significant information speed and types of hardware on various networks. This information can also be used to isolate portions of networks to identify potential heavy traffic users or other sources of potential exploitation.\nNetwork mapping is also useful for illustrating the potential for any particular targeted attack to extend beyond its intended target and result in collateral damage or blowback. Conceptually network mapping is not dissimilar from attempting to map radar or surface-to-air missile locations prior to a bombing campaign. The intent of network mapping is to gain an operational knowledge of an adversary's systems prior to engaging in an OCO.\nForensic analysis of the Stuxnet worm found the worm partially employed network mapping to target its attacks, focusing on isolated networks using memory sticks as the initial method of transmission.[38] Once in, Stuxnet focused its attack on networks with programmable logic controllers (PLCs) of a specific type and caused uranium enrichment centrifuges to malfunction.[39] The level of sophistication required to drill down to get to this level of detail to plan an attack is remarkable, particularly considering the complexity and number of overall systems and the air-gapped nature of the systems.\nNetwork mapping is both an offensive and defensive intelligence endeavor. To adequately prepare both the defensive and offensive battlespaces, an accurate picture of systems is needed. Arguably the dual domestic-foreign pictures are complementary and help avoid violating part 2.13 of Executive Order 12333, which prevents any covert action from influencing U.S. political processes, public opinion, policies, media, or various sections of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.[40]\nNetwork mapping and monitoring is a double-edged sword. Legally network mapping can be considered CE, and therefore domestic network mapping by U.S. intelligence agencies without a warrant would be prohibited. However, network mapping is of critical importance to the maintenance of national security infrastructures. Thus far the intelligence community does not have a formal commitment from the White House or the Justice Department to engage in any domestic CE operations.[41] Currently in the United States there is an uneasy and inefficient public-private commitment to providing information on network security across critical infrastructure. A thorough understanding of domestic and foreign networks assists in visualization for both offensive and defensive\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER SEVEN\npurposes, and effort to push reasoned analysis of threats has begun to make its way into Congress.⁴²\nNetwork mapping assists in the identification of network components. Once network components are known, it becomes necessary to explore vulnerabilities within systems. Most damaging are zero-day vulnerabilities, which are vulnerabilities in computer applications of which even system administrators are unaware. The Stuxnet attack exposed several zero-day vulnerabilities in the Windows software controlling/monitoring the programmable logic controllers, causing the attached centrifuges to spin outside of their safe operational standards.\nSystemic vulnerabilities necessitate a thorough understanding of the historical record of different types of attacks and exploits. The identification of zero-day vulnerabilities should lead network administrators to immediately patch these gaps. Intelligence plays a role in identifying what types of attacks have been used in the past and what vulnerabilities these attacks attempted to exploit. Historical accounting is important for both offensive and defensive preparation of the battlespace. For obvious reasons it is important to prevent repeat attacks on domestic systems; at the same time it is important not to engage in repeat attack methods once a vulnerability on an opposing system has been fixed. Such an attack would likely be ineffective and lead to anonymity-attribution problems.\nThe historical accounting of attack types by countries and substate actors also alerts operators within the intelligence and military community to the threat spectrum capabilities of a particular cyber adversary. Understanding the threat spectrum capabilities of states facilitates an accurate conceptualization of their power to operate within the domain. Table 7.3 is a representation of known threat spectrum capabilities.\nThe above areas of consideration within CE are only a small sampling of the overall tasking priorities for intelligence using CE methods. They hint at a broad applicability for CYBERINT methods in the preparation of the battlespace.\n# CONVENTIONAL INTELLIGENCE\nIntelligence collected on budgetary allocations, offensive and defensive cyber unit sizes, and training methodologies provides the clearest parallel to conventional intelligence. As in conventional intelligence, most countries are frequently unwilling to release data on absolute military expenditures or the sizes and force structures within their military. Military capabilities are a closely guarded secret in most countries. Capabilities are particularly secretive in the cyber domain. Often if cyber capabilities are exposed, they cease to be capabilities.⁴³ Once Stuxnet was discovered by the Iranians, defensive measures were taken to \"plug\" the holes the Stuxnet attack employed. This dramatically reduces\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nTABLE 7.3 Cyber Threat Spectrum\n|  Levels (Types) of Attack | Description | Feasibility | Complexity  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  Propaganda | The propagation of information via the Internet to affect public, private, or governmental opinion.

Whereas missiles can be launched with repeated success because the ability to defend against a moving projectile is difficult, a similar cyber weapon is more easily defended against once it has been identified. Antivirus software can be reprogrammed to identify and isolate repeat threats, and zero-day vulnerabilities can be patched.\nAn excellent example of an open source analysis of cyber capabilities comes from Stokes, Lin, and Hsiao, who examine in explicit detail the construction, location, leadership, and mission of many aspects of the Chinese People's Liberation Army information warfare programs.⁴⁴ Their report is an example of a high-value detailed analysis that could be supplemented by conventional intelligence to enhance policy-maker and combatant commander comprehension of the battlespace. The detailed analysis of the location and force structure can cause an enemy to shift its tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and make them less reliable. Alternatively, not revealing that information has been gained on TTPs can provide an offensive edge in cyber operations.\nThe implications for conventional intelligence collection methods indicate that intelligence on cyber does not necessarily need to remain cyberbound or exclusively within the realm of CE. Many metrics such as force size matter in cyber and can be examined to create a better assessment of potential adversaries. Cyber force size is particularly important from a malware development perspective. Complex coding scripts typically necessitate large numbers of programmers to develop and test the scripts. The ability for an individual to accomplish highly complex attacks is possible but less likely than a large cyber warfare unit working with the same objective.\nLikewise, knowing where a unit is located or how programmers were trained can help planners determine the best response to a particular attack, or how best to manipulate their organizational structure. Derek Clark and Kai Konrad refer to this as identifying the weakest link.⁴⁵ The identification of the weakest link is particularly important in cyber defense and offense. There are multiple fronts (systems) needing defense. All it takes is one \"best shot\" to achieve significant damage. While this weakest link can be identified through CE operations outlined in the previous section, it can also be identified within the training, command, and organizational structure of units charged with conducting or protecting against cyber attacks.\nClosely related to the conventional military metrics above, yet likely unique to the cyber domain, are public-private ICT collaborations. Although most countries have programs for military public and private collaborations with universities and businesses for research and development, within the cyber domain the importance of this relationship is magnified for multiple reasons. First, much of the training and education necessary to conduct offensive or defensive oper\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nThe Role of Intelligence in Cyberspace [119]\nations within cyberspace can be learned at public institutions or can be crafted for private sector use. This extends far beyond the development of technology to the actual training of the warfighter, the development of the platforms upon which the domain rests, and more. Second, these collaborations spread out but do not diffuse potential vulnerabilities.\nBecause collaborations can form the foundational aspects of the cyber warriors within offensive and defensive units, they can train, equip, and prepare in ways far different from conventional military means. Most countries have a balance between civilian and military protection of their national cyber infrastructures based largely on the development of computer emergency response teams (CERTs). An intelligence assessment of the strength and quality of ICT collaborations is of critical importance in understanding the cyber battlespace.\nICT collaborations are not necessarily official and do not need to be highly structured and regimented. Alexander Klimburg provides evidence Russia and China have created groups of plausibly deniable cyber attackers.[46] Creating an accurate open source measure of unofficial collaborations is difficult. An intelligence focus on unofficial collaborations with entities can contextualize cyber incidents such as the 2007 cyber attacks directed at Estonian governmental, bank, and communications websites.[47] The attacks were motivated by a decision to move a Russian war memorial from central Tallinn. While initial reports indicated Russia was the culprit, Russia denied any participation in the cyber attacks.[48] The reality is somewhat murkier and more akin to an unofficial sanction or condoning of cyber attacks by the Russian government.[49]\nThe collection and production of intelligence on more conventional attributes of pertinence to the cyber domain is a role in which the intelligence community is likely already engaged. Occasionally reports on issues relating to this category of intelligence are published for public consumption. A recent report of this type was produced for the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission to examine China's capability to conduct cyber warfare and cyber exploitation.[50] Knowledge of capabilities is still applicable to the cyber domain and is greatly influenced by conventional intelligence collection methods and subsequent analysis, which contextualizes the meaning of raw intelligence.\n## HUMINT AND CYBER\nHuman intelligence (HUMINT) stands out in cyber for two particular reasons. First, HUMINT agents can provide accurate internal information on systems and access to those systems unavailable through CE and other intelligence collection methods. Second, human assets can serve as a bridge between the external world and air-gapped or other forms of secure networks. As was indicated above, it is likely that the Stuxnet virus was distributed using a thumb drive,\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER SEVEN\nwhich needed to be inserted into a machine within an air-gapped network. HUMINT agents can serve as a vulnerability against which most network administrators will be unable to provide significant protection.\nThe role of a HUMINT asset with access to information on networks can be extremely damaging. Even if the agent is on a lightly classified network, the repercussions of his or her actions can be enormous. The scandal caused by Bradley Manning (now named Chelsea Manning) leaking more than 260,000 diplomatic cables to WikiLeaks in 2010 is illustrative of the problem posed by internal threats.⁵¹ Manning’s leak and the even more damaging 2013 document releases by Edward Snowden, a former employee of a contractor affiliated with both the NSA and CIA, highlight the potential damage a rogue employee can have on the ability of the intelligence community to keep information secret.⁵² Snowden’s insider collection and subsequent release of documents pertaining to the National Security Agency likely constitutes one of the most significant intelligence leaks of all time and resulted in an estimated 1.7 million documents being released in violation of U.S. classification law.⁵³ Moreover, unlike the leaks by Manning, the Snowden leaks revealed many of the TTPs used by the NSA in its intelligence operations in the cyber domain. These revelations have been extremely damaging and have resulted in changes in the way adversaries safeguard their cyber infrastructure.\nHUMINT threats need to be developed and enhanced for offensive intelligence and protected against for domestic national security counterintelligence. Gaining access to the technical schematics, documents, information, login procedures, or any of a multitude of other targets of intelligence a HUMINT asset could provide is a critical aspect added directly by intelligence to the understanding of the cyber domain. Furthermore, HUMINT agents are almost impossible to detect under normal circumstances as they can often engage in significant espionage while still easily performing the normal duties. Unlike the spy thriller days of old when agents had to sneak out of a building with classified documents in a folder or a box, they can often place thousands or millions of documents on a solid-state drive and easily conceal it upon exiting a facility. Many of these drives are smaller in size than a penny.\nBeyond the collection of intelligence from HUMINT sources, these insiders can assist in the implementation of cyber actions. Information within a 2005 report by the U.S. Secret Service in cooperation with Carnegie Mellon indicated that up to 29 percent of all attacks against a surveyed group of critical infrastructure stakeholders were initiated by insiders.⁵⁴ The majority of motivations behind these attacks were not related to intelligence or covert action. This, however, does not preclude the possibility of using insiders to affect or gain information or access on adversary systems. The recruitment and maintenance of insider threats by the intelligence community should be a top priority. These\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nThe Role of Intelligence in Cyberspace\nFIGURE 7.1 Timeline for Attack Implementation\nagents can offer a mission a critical component, often during times when more lengthy intelligence collection processes are constrained by events.\n# TIME FOR ATTACK RECOGNITION, COMPLETION, AND ATTRIBUTION\nAttack recognition and attribution are also critical for both a defensive and offensive battlespace planning. All of the intelligence collection methods and the focus of the intel process of trying to comprehend the cyber domain culminate in understanding, from a mission critical orientation, the progression of cyber attacks. Figure 7.1 is a simplified model for understanding attack planning and progression within a battlespace modeled loosely on the JP 3-51 electronic warfare-planning model.[55] This model is informed by intelligence collection. Line one of the figure indicates a policy-maker's perspective on the process of engaging in conflict. A conflict initiation is (o) planned, (1) implemented, and (2) completed. Policy-makers want to know what resources any given action will take and how long it will take to complete it. In cyber a more accurate timeline for action in cyberspace requires (o) intelligence collection, (1) operational planning of the attack with an informed knowledge of the battlespace, (2) understanding of the time it takes for the attack to be completed, (3) how long until the attack is recognized as an attack by the adversary, (4) how long until that adversary can do something about the attack, (5) how long until the adversary assigns attribution for the attack. The ordering of the items listed above greatly affects the ability for an attack to be conducted successfully. Intelligence informs the policy-maker and commander as to the feasibility of a particular type of attack and the probability of success. If recognition of an attack occurs early in the timeline of events the probability of success is diminished.\nThe timeline can be tested in much the same way conventional weapons are tested. It would be absurd to send a bomber over a potential target with a completely untested bomb, or to send a soldier into battle with an untested model of rifle. Just as weapons are tested in the physical world, they need to be tested in the cyber domain as well. This testing provides added information to both\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER SEVEN\nFIGURE 7.2 The Influence of Intelligence on Cyber Operations\nModified from E. Waltz, Information Warfare.\nthe policy-maker and the combatant commander as to the effectiveness of the weapon and the timeline of events above. If a cyber weapon is slow and easily detectable, its probability for success is diminished. This lowered probability for success does not nullify its use but does condition it.\nOne aspect of this phase of IPB is that it is extremely beneficial to both the offensive and defensive strategic and tactical operations. By planning and testing potential attacks against theoretical adversarial systems, the intelligence community provides an out-of-the-box perspective necessary to prevent similar attacks against domestic targets. This logic would indicate an attempt to use a worm like Stuxnet against the U.S. infrastructure would run into greater problems than if the weapon had been developed first elsewhere.\n# IPB AND ITS IMPACT ON CYBER\nThe role of intelligence in cyber is not dissimilar from its role in the conventional domains. There are new areas in which collection and analysis need to occur, yet its overall objective remains the same. Returning to Edward Waltz's concept of information preparation of the battlefield, figure 7.2 illustrates intelligence's influence on operations originating within the cyber domain. The role of intelligence in cyber is to accurately facilitate an understanding of those\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nThe Role of Intelligence in Cyberspace [123]\nentities and the possible tools by which to influence them. The cyber domain is surrounded with hype and hysteria. Many of the claims are accurately based in reality. But the known unknowns are still enormous within this evolving domain, and it is incumbent on intelligence to provide an accurate assessment of the current state of affairs.\nAll-source intelligence for cyber operations requires the intelligence community to think beyond domestic system defense. The focus should be balanced between foreign and domestic intelligence, thereby mutually informing one another and creating a systemic defense for national assets in addition to better facilitating decision-makers with a more accurate picture of how a potential cyber attack might succeed or fail.\n# CYBER AS COVERT ACTION\nTo further define the role of intelligence in cyber, it is necessary to look more deeply into the laws codifying the conduct of the intelligence community. All of the above sections provide a framework for defining the role of intelligence with regard to IPB. Cyber conflict is, by its very nature, covert. Even if an attack is discovered, it is often unattributable. Attacks can be designed to go unnoticed and affect changes to systems and their components for days, weeks, or months without detection. Even in instances where groups such as Anonymous publically take credit for attacks, responsibility is typically claimed post hoc. Nearly all examples of state-on-state cyber attacks have been covert.\nThe covert nature of cyber brings full circle Warner's definition of intelligence as attempting to influence. Covert action is a secret operation to influence a foreign entity. At least in theory, most, if not all, cyber attacks begin covertly. Section 1.7(a)(4) of Executive Order 12333 regarding intelligence activities describes covert action:\nConduct convert action activities approved by the President. No agency except the Central Intelligence Agency (or the Armed Forces of the United States in time of war declared by the Congress or during any period covered by a report from the President to the Congress consistent with the War Powers Resolution, Public Law 93-148) may conduct any covert action activity unless the President determines that another agency is more likely to achieve a particular objective.[56]\nEvident in the early structuring of the governmental approach to cyberspace is the categorization of cyber operations as covert actions. The Department of Defense originally took the lead with General Keith Alexander as the head of both NSA and Cyber Command, a path that has continued now that Admiral Michael Rogers has taken over as the head of both organizations. This indicates the president has established an agency other than the Central Intelligence\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER SEVEN\nAgency as the primary covert operator within this domain. While the logic behind having a military intelligence organization commander and an organizational structure that falls under the U.S. Strategic Command (STRATCOM) runs counter to EO 12333, the institutional capacity of the DoD in the technical domain and the scale of the problem being faced within this new domain make the assignment appropriate.\n# SUMMARIZING THE ROLE OF INTELLIGENCE WITHIN THE CYBER DOMAIN\nIn defining the role of intelligence within the cyber domain, it is necessary to take a holistic approach. From a collection perspective, the intelligence community should be and has been working in coordination with a hybrid push-and-pull intelligence cycle to both elevate the importance of this domain and facilitate collection within it. The emphasis has been heavily defensive up to this point and largely focused on countering threats rather than anticipating them. This needs to change, and the only way this can change is if the intelligence community begins to actively turn its sights on adversaries and develop more rigorous all-source intelligence combining novel CYBERINT technologies to augment reporting on this domain. Parroting Amoroso's assertion, cyber should be included on the daily intelligence briefs of policy-makers. The inclusion would likely start the process of demystification of this immensely complicated domain.\nCyberspace is a domain that can be used to fulfill all aspects of Warner's definition of intelligence to some degree. It is a domain in which it is possible to gain understanding about other states beyond and within the domain itself, but it is also a domain that can influence other states' policy decisions as well as perceptions. In particular, accurate intelligence on both sides of the domestic-foreign divide can mutually inform decision-makers about vulnerabilities and the eventual decision to use cyber as an offensive weapon or how best to defend against attacks. Moreover, intelligence can rein in the debate on cyber to a more realistic area of operations predicated on sound estimates rather than on grandiose speculation.\nThe intelligence community itself commonly is the point of origin for OCOs emanating from the cyber domain and will likely serve as a force multiplier in instances where a combined conventional cyber attack is necessary. To engage in cyber conflict, just as in conventional conflict, intelligence is needed to prepare the battlespace and facilitate an accurate assessment of the probability for success and utility for any type of operation. This preparation hones the weapons, decisions, and effect of a potential operation. More importantly for national security, a thorough and accurate preparation of both the foreign and domestic battlespaces will serve to inform and enhance cyber security.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms"

From a collection perspective, the intelligence community should be and has been working in coordination with a hybrid push-and-pull intelligence cycle to both elevate the importance of this domain and facilitate collection within it. The emphasis has been heavily defensive up to this point and largely focused on countering threats rather than anticipating them. This needs to change, and the only way this can change is if the intelligence community begins to actively turn its sights on adversaries and develop more rigorous all-source intelligence combining novel CYBERINT technologies to augment reporting on this domain. Parroting Amoroso's assertion, cyber should be included on the daily intelligence briefs of policy-makers. The inclusion would likely start the process of demystification of this immensely complicated domain.\nCyberspace is a domain that can be used to fulfill all aspects of Warner's definition of intelligence to some degree. It is a domain in which it is possible to gain understanding about other states beyond and within the domain itself, but it is also a domain that can influence other states' policy decisions as well as perceptions. In particular, accurate intelligence on both sides of the domestic-foreign divide can mutually inform decision-makers about vulnerabilities and the eventual decision to use cyber as an offensive weapon or how best to defend against attacks. Moreover, intelligence can rein in the debate on cyber to a more realistic area of operations predicated on sound estimates rather than on grandiose speculation.\nThe intelligence community itself commonly is the point of origin for OCOs emanating from the cyber domain and will likely serve as a force multiplier in instances where a combined conventional cyber attack is necessary. To engage in cyber conflict, just as in conventional conflict, intelligence is needed to prepare the battlespace and facilitate an accurate assessment of the probability for success and utility for any type of operation. This preparation hones the weapons, decisions, and effect of a potential operation. More importantly for national security, a thorough and accurate preparation of both the foreign and domestic battlespaces will serve to inform and enhance cyber security.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms",

    "CHAPTER 7\n\n# Defining the Role of Intelligence in Cyberspace\n\nIf ignorant both of your enemy and yourself, you are certain to be in peril.\nSun Tzu\n\nINFORMATION IS THE LIFEBLOOD of modern states. Intelligence is increasingly facilitating information superiority through an understanding of the cyber domain. The Department of Defense's \"Joint Vision 2020\" establishes the goal of information superiority on the battlefield. This information superiority enables decision superiority and favorably tilts the strategic and tactical balance. Information superiority is built on cyber power, scale and complexity of attacks, robustness of defense, policy positions, systemic vulnerabilities and dependencies, and actor anonymity and attribution issues. Intelligence plays a mission critical role in assessing these characteristics. The discussion below examines the role of intelligence in identifying these characteristics within the cyber domain and examines how it influences the decision-making of policy-makers. Specifically the focus hones in on how intelligence increases the effectiveness of identifying potential attackers within the cyber domain and informs the decision-making of policy-makers when engaging in covert cyber action directed against a potential adversary. The discussion is designed to serve as a strategic framework in which to understand the role of intelligence within the cyber domain.\n\nIs it really necessary to examine the role of intelligence within the cyber domain as contextually different than in a conventional domain? The short answer is yes. Cyber necessitates independent examination because it is characteristically different, and yet at the same time it is a pervasive feature affecting outcomes within other domains. What differentiates cyber from land, sea, air, and space are three fundamental attributes relevant to intelligence practitioners. First, the cyber domain is a man-made domain. Second, military capabilities across the other domains are managed through the cyber domain. Third, military and civilian aspects of the cyber domain are often intertwined and difficult to differentiate. These attributes pose unique opportunities and problems for intelligence officials.\n\nThe man-made nature of the cyber domain makes it a largely virtual domain with its value corresponding to the speed and volume of information contained\n\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms",

However, the cyber domain is not entirely virtual and has numerous real-world connection points to everything from industrial control systems of power and water management facilities to the weapon systems of drones flying above distant battlefields.\n\nCyberspace is not tangible in the same way as more conventional domains and therefore necessitates a new form of dynamic intelligence evolving from all-source collection of conventional and novel intelligence sources. A recent National Research Council report states that intelligence in the cyber domain is useful for both strategic and tactical purposes.¹ The strategic and tactical importance of intelligence's role in influencing the cyber domain falls within the concept of all-source intelligence. Loch Johnson defines all-source intelligence as one of the fundamental propositions of a theory of strategic intelligence.² More importantly for the purposes of understanding the operational and political environments within which offensive and defensive actions in cyberspace can occur, it is necessary to understand what intelligence is within decisions regarding the cyber domain and how intelligence influences those decisions.\n\n## DEFINING INTELLIGENCE\n\nThere are dozens of different definitions of intelligence, each of which is in some way applicable to understanding cyber action. One of the more succinct and conceptually ordered comes from Michael Warner, who defines intelligence as a \"secret, state activity to understand or influence foreign entities.\"³ His definition establishes the fundamental premises of both collection and analysis, while including actions designed to influence. Intelligence is vital to the cyber domain because foreign entities are increasingly storing, managing, and directing their governmental, public, private, and military functions in a digitized world.\n\nThe traditional intelligence collection types (INTs) are still of immense value, yet they must be combined with aspects of the digitized target spectrum to provide a holistic view of both threats and opportunities. At present the majority of studies in the public domain have focused on defense.⁴ This defensive posture is made clear by General Keith Alexander, the director of the National Security Agency and commander of United States Cyber Command, when he writes: \"US Cyber Command's efforts and planning aim to ensure that the DoD has done all it can to defend and deter determined adversaries, mitigate dangerous threats, and address nagging vulnerabilities, so that even our most capable opponents will know that interfering with our nation's equities in cyberspace is a losing proposition.\"⁵\n\nThis defensive and deterrent-reliant posture is limiting and prone to inadequacies. Echoing Machiavelli and to some extent Sun Tzu, the adage \"the best defense is a good offense\" offers a novel way of considering action and intelli\n\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms",
    "The Role of Intelligence in Cyberspace [103]\n\ngence within cyber. More accurately, it allows for a systematic approach to both national cyber defensive and offensive resource allocations. Beyond the efficiency argument for shifting the focus from solely defense to a balance between defense and offense, intelligence collection can help to inform offensive strategies and the decision to use cyber as a weapon. The role of intelligence within cyber becomes increasingly important when considering the difficulty of achieving any significant measure of deterrence within the cyber domain.⁶\n\nThe defensive orientation of the majority of cyber literature has a constraining effect on decision-making processes for the use of offensive cyber weapons. This defensive focus is largely due to both the alarmist calls of some scholars and policy-makers and an information communications technologies industry orientation offering many more strategies for defense than for offense. While I do not dispute the need for defense, this defensive focus leads the national security establishment down a path of attempting to create an impenetrable system. If there is one thing that is abundantly clear in the cyber domain it is that the only impenetrable system is the one that has not been made. Cyber is based on physics and algorithms. The mathematics and science behind security measures can be immensely complex and take massive computing power to penetrate, but that does not make them impenetrable. Even the most robust systems secured with checks and encryptions are still highly vulnerable to their users' ignorance or malice, as was the case with Edward Snowden in 2013.\n\nInstead of focusing on a solely carte blanche defensive posture toward cyber security, intelligence can provide both an offensive and defensive picture more effective at safeguarding national security. Taking a step back from the conventional cyber security literature, intelligence can direct cyber security efforts to not merely safeguard national security but also provide an offensive tool for use against other states. The vast literature on intelligence, ranging from the way intelligence influences the policy-making process to how it helps to understand aspects of the development of utility for actions, serves as a guide in defining the role of intelligence within the cyber domain.\n\nReflecting on Warner's definition of intelligence, the spectrum of intelligence collection methods—from human intelligence (HUMINT) to the more technical collection methods of signals intelligence (SIGINT), measurement and signatures intelligence (MASINT), geospatial intelligence (GEOINT), and open source intelligence (OSINT)—works together in an all-source environment to provide an accurate understanding of foreign entities. (Table 7.1 provides a quick definitional reference for the various intelligence collection types.) The understanding provided by intelligence has largely focused on the conventional domains and on political decision-making. However, as decisions in conventional domains increasingly migrate toward cyberspace, and the systems controlling the tools used in these domains increasingly become digitally connected, the\n\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms",

However, as in many of the other types of intelligence collection, techniques and agencies often overlap.\n\nimportance of understanding the technical schematics and decision processes becomes vital to national security.\n\nNick Cullather, in an article on digital connections on the battlefield, indicates significant advances in the development of network-centric warfare. Cullather notes that the rise of a \"revolution in military affairs\" has largely not been matched by the intelligence community's ability to keep up.[7] This is of particular importance when looking beyond the network-centric battlefield of conventional weapons to the new zone of confrontation within cyberspace itself. Similarly, Michael Herman finds that counterterrorism intelligence analysis requires a broad spectrum of information sources brought together.[8] ICT facilitates the mitigation of \"stovepipes\" and increases the efficiency in information transference.[9] Information transmission has also been facilitated following the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 by the creation of \"fusion centers.\"[10] ICT has a role to play not only in the conduct of war on the battlefield, but also in the management of a conventional traditional threat spectrum within the fusion centers and beyond in the wider intelligence community.\n\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms",
    "The Role of Intelligence in Cyberspace [105]\n\nTerrorism is not commonly regarded as part of the conventional threat spectrum, yet in reality most terrorist acts take place in the physical world and require bombs and guns. However, the information coordination necessary to organize, plan, and conduct warfare, terrorist acts, and political strategies has largely shifted to cyberspace. The 2008 Mumbai terrorist attacks are a poignant example of terrorists leveraging technology and open source intelligence collected from public sites and software such as Google Earth to plan and orchestrate mass murder.[11] As horrific as the use of digital tools for planning attacks is, it is not isolated to open source intelligence collection via tools. Terrorists also use open source cryptography and crypto-currencies to finance their operations.[12] Intelligence agencies are in a competition with other states and organizations to leverage tools effectively to prevent attacks by terrorists and to mitigate international incidents before they arise.\n\nWhile open source research is fundamentally more powerful than ever before, available open source information provides only a limited aperture to realistically size up threats and targets within cyberspace itself. The problem of intelligence in cyberspace is massive both in terms of scale and complexity of data. Joel Brenner, a former inspector general of the National Security Agency and head of U.S. counterintelligence, indicated there has been an enormous threat emanating from within cyberspace that is not being adequately addressed.[13]\n\nModern warfare, command and control warfare (C2W), is network centric. Large swaths of the national critical infrastructures in states that pose conventional security and economic threats to the United States are controlled by digital systems. The literature is less focused on the need for understanding these vulnerabilities than it is on safeguarding them. The defensive focus, to a large degree, overshadows the development of offensive capabilities.\n\nPhil Williams, Timothy Shimeal, and Casey Dunlevy make a well-reasoned case arguing for focused intelligence efforts on identifying threats to national cyber security.[14] These authors make a valid point that needs to be addressed and is being addressed by several national strategy documents on the topic, including the National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace and the \"International Strategy for Cyberspace.\" One report of particular importance addressing many of the issues brought up by Williams, Shimeal, and Dunlevy is the October 2011 report by the Office of the National Counterintelligence Executive on cyber espionage.[15] A broad spectrum of federal strategies and reports has made identification and protection against vulnerabilities a top priority. More recently the president of the United States under Executive Order 13636 in February 2013 directed the government to begin actively seeking out and planning strategies to mitigate cyber threats to national critical infrastructure.\n\nThis is a process that is under way and includes an alphabet soup of agencies from across the civilian and military spectrum of the government.

    "CHAPTER SEVEN\n\ncurrent problem that keeps cropping up in many of the discussions on critical infrastructure is network awareness. Many companies and firms affiliated with critical infrastructure do not have an adequate understanding of their own vulnerabilities, let alone how they interact to create systemic threats. One industry based on personal communications and working experience that seems to be working very hard to address these issues is the U.S. financial sector, which in many ways is pioneering cyber security efforts under E.O. 13636.\n\nCurrently most cyber security is based on attacks or incidents in progress or that have already occurred. It is difficult, if not impossible, to defend against an unknown attack. Much of the effort in the United States cyber community now seems to be equivalent to plugging the holes in the dike after it floods. It is a fact that most cyber attacks are repeat attacks originating at the lower end of the threat spectrum, making the strategy of filling holes in the dike an absolute necessity in an effort to prevent repeat intrusions from identical or similar malware types. Yet this post hoc strategy largely fails to address the more serious problem of accurately anticipating what the next type of attack is going to be. This strategy, best referred to as a \"Maginot Line\" strategy, is prone to failure in areas where technological and strategic capabilities rapidly evolve. The real challenge is to develop intelligence-based approaches to cyberspace that prevent future attacks before they happen.\n\nThere is a significant and sustained effort underway on the defensive side of the cyber debate within the DoD to develop better security. The DoD is currently employing at least three categories of defensive teams to facilitate DoD network protection: DoD information network operations teams (DoDIN Ops), defensive cyber operations—internal defensive measures teams (DCO-IDM or cyber protection teams), and defensive cyber operations—response action teams (DCO-RA or national mission teams).[16] Yet all of these teams are heavily reliant on intelligence on the cyber environment for defense (ICE-D). The teams that fit into these categories are tasked with segments of the overall problem. While the DoDIN-Ops teams are tasked with ensuring sustained secure operations on DoD networks, they are not focused on adversary behaviors in those networks. Their work is informed by adversary behaviors but seeks to maintain network security in aggregate. DCO-IDM or cyber protection teams function as hunter killers within the network. They are tasked with seeking out individuals engaging DoD networks illegally and stopping the attacks or exploits. DCO-RA or national mission teams are tasked with responding to adversary behavior in DoD networks. As should be readily apparent, the problem is enormous and relies on intelligence for all aspects of ICE-D functions. The DoD network environment alone is composed of millions of computing devices and users.\n\nBecause we exist in a world of known unknowns and unknown unknowns, to paraphrase Secretary Rumsfeld, cyber security is likely the former rather than\n\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms",

Because the community develops, tests, and employs its own tools, it is unable to take into account methods of testing that have not yet threatened systems in the past. This is an in-the-box, out-of-the-box, forget-the-box problem. The designers of systems, software, and networks are talented and smart individuals; they lead the world in technical innovation, yet because they are inside their own systems, it becomes it intrinsically difficult to isolate unforeseen problems. United States Cyber Command and various other teams from the services and the various academies have tried to address this problem by creating competitive cyber teams that compete with one other and against civilian competitors in various challenges such as DefCon capture the flag contests and others. These various DCO and DoDIN-Ops teams also engage one another to consistently foster novel thinking on security.\n\nYet the challenge is immense, and solutions are best achieved by constant introspection. Below are several proposed strategies to help facilitate the development of improved defensive operations. First, the current orientation toward plugging holes must continue. While this post hoc process is frustrating, it prevents or at least slows further intrusions. The mentality of these DoDIN-Ops is one of defense. The objective is to secure and defend systems against all possible or known types of attacks. The most realistic approach is to defend against known types of attacks. The systems become fortified against repeat incidents or at least can minimize their severity. The work of these teams is not sexy; it is not offense oriented; it is a process of continuous network security development. Second, DCO-IDM teams must also actively hunt in government and defense networks for potential adversaries and leverage information gained through all source intelligence collection and communication with DoDIN-Ops, DCO-RA, and OCO teams to anticipate potential blind spots. These teams must also be regularly rotated to provide them time to think like attackers. Third, DCO-RA teams must leverage all-source intelligence and continuous communications with DCO-IDM and OCO teams to engage adversaries in a defensive posture on foreign networks before they endanger DoD networks. While these teams are in the process of getting organized and established, it is important that these teams have clear interteam communications to mitigate stovepiping. The co-location or consistent rotation of team members would likely facilitate enhanced operational results. The co-location and coordination of members within a team should be of paramount importance as it allows analysts and technicians the opportunity to collaborate and developed a detailed and synergistic understanding of capabilities.\n\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms",
    "CHAPTER SEVEN\n\nThe wider intelligence community must use all-source methods to collect as much intelligence on potential opponents as possible. This means profiling every aspect of other nations' cyber offensive and defensive capabilities. This requires a robust all-source collection methodology. Signals intelligence must look for transmissions and communications as well as spikes in Internet traffic and geo-locate them using IP addresses. These geo-located IP addresses need to be analyzed using satellites and drones to provide accurate geospatial information on the areas in question. Open source intelligence collection should attempt to gain as much publicly available information as possible on areas of interest through legal means. Once all of this information has been compiled and assessed, targeted HUMINT operations should begin working on developing assets within these areas or with connections to these areas. These agents should be recruited for multiple purposes. First, they should be used to secure intelligence on the capabilities of potential adversaries. These capabilities are defined in more detail below. Second, agents should also be recruited to become potential insider threats, a tool of particular importance on air-gapped systems.[18] Third, intelligence agencies should also place an emphasis on cyber exploitation (CE) and attempt to probe and map out network infrastructures, vulnerabilities, and strengths of adversaries. The last point is of importance both from an offensive and defensive strategic orientation.\n\nAnother major problem with the cyber domain arises out of its systemic complexity. As Williams, Shimeal, and Dunlevy accurately note, cyber defenders often do not have a realistic or accurate picture of their own systems, let alone the systems of adversaries who are attacking them.[19] Following their recommendations, the national security community would be prudent to make use of the principle of knowing yourself. This requires a consistent focus on domestic systems. However, only focusing on domestic systems leads to the \"Maginot Line\" tendency in which it is assumed networks are created to be impenetrable.\n\n# INTELLIGENCE AND THE CYBER BATTLESPACE\n\nThe cyber domain is a modern battlespace and necessitates a holistic understanding. To defend against or engage in offensive actions, it is necessary to have an accurate understanding of the operational environment. According to Edward Waltz, any battlespace, whether offensive or defensive, requires a combination of dominant battlespace awareness (DBA) and dominant battlespace knowledge (DBK).[20] The process of identifying what is and is not important to understanding a particular battlespace largely falls to the discretion of policy-makers within the intelligence cycle.\n\nIn writing about intelligence and decision-making, Stephen Marrin states: \"the intelligence cycle starts with decision-maker information requirements lev\n\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms",
    "The Role of Intelligence in Cyberspace [109]\n\nied on intelligence collection capabilities, the processing of collected raw intelligence and transmission of this processed material to analysts who decipher its meaning, and relay that understanding back to the decision-makers.”²¹\n\nThe decision-maker engages in tasking through a number of different “pull” mechanisms including governmental reports, hearings before Congress, presidential directives, and executive orders. These tasking methods and others combine to facilitate within the intelligence community an accurate understanding of what constitutes the battlespace in the eyes of the policy-maker. Often the planning and direction can be informal requests from the executive or from Congress, and at other times it can come from official strategy documents.\n\nPrior to 9/11, terrorism was a priority, but the planning and direction of resources had not yet reached a critical mass sufficient to prevent the terrible attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Marrin and others find the intelligence process frequently fails to adequately define what constitutes a tasking priority for the intelligence community, necessitating a “push” from within the community outward. There are many instances in which policy-makers ignore, misinterpret, or misuse intelligence despite adequate tasking and intelligence production and dissemination.²²\n\nThe push mechanism of the intelligence community can happen in several ways. Often it can follow what constructivists call “norm entrepreneurs.” Entrepreneurs in the cyber domain include Richard Clarke, or John Arquilla and David Ronfeldt, among others.²³ These individuals bring to national policymakers’ attention issues of importance and help direct the intelligence community’s efforts. If, however, they make outlandish claims and statements, their push for new norms can have a backlash and inspire counter-entrepreneurs such as Thomas Rid, who writes that cyber war does not and will not occur.²⁴ Most traditional intelligence push comes from within the intelligence community itself.²⁵ Because the intelligence community is pushing intelligence not requested by the decision-makers, the concept of the intelligence cycle can, as Marrin notes, become linear.²⁶\n\nBecause the domain is so complex, it is beneficial for the president and policy-makers to have individuals with the requisite understanding of the domain not only in policy and legal terms but also in technical terms. The position currently established is known as the cyber czar. While this position is typically filled by someone with policy or legal expertise, it is beneficial for that individual to have a wide background and a reasonable technical understanding so he or she can facilitate complex discussions. Former cyber czar Melissa Hathaway would be a prime example of the type of individual who could accurately convey the complexity of the technical and historical attributes of interactions in the domain while at the same time have a firm grasp on the policy and legal implications of future actions. This person then sits at the choke point of the\n\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms",
    "CHAPTER SEVEN\n\npush and pull on the cyber domain and distills the information into a balanced reality applicable for decision-makers.\n\nFor intelligence to adequately focus its sights on any battlespace, planning and direction from policy-makers must occur. Once policy-makers have established the importance of a battlespace, the intelligence community must find ways to deliver accurate and reliable intelligence. The objective of intelligence collection is not solely to provide real-time information on the battlespace; rather, it is best thought of as battlespace preparation or what Waltz refers to as \"intelligence preparation of the battlespace\" (IPB).[27] Although Waltz specifically refers to IPB in the context of coordinated conventional warfare and the use of information operations in network-centric warfare, the theoretical principles apply across all domains. IPB, according to Waltz, includes providing an understanding of the \"physical, political, electronic, cyber, and other dimensions of the battlespace.\"[28] Alan D. Campen and Douglas H. Dearth reiterate the concept of IPB in Cyberwar 3.0. They state that information warfare requires an accurate knowledge of the battlespace as well as real-time awareness of situations within the battlespace as they arise.\n\nBefore moving directly into how each collection type can add to a holistic picture of the battlespace, it is necessary to define what constitutes the battlespace in the cyber domain. The battlespace, according to Waltz, constitutes \"all decision-relevant elements within a defined battlespace, and the ability to predict with very high confidence near-term enemy actions and outcomes.\"[29] More specifically this requires an understanding of human, material, and technical capabilities and the relationship of these capabilities within themselves and to other aspects of the operational environment. It is also important to understand the political implications of alterations in capabilities and the environment over time. A battlespace for cyber can be domestic or foreign and is considered to constitute three basic layers: physical, logical, and social layers. Intelligence must inform policy-makers on all three categories.\n\nThe physical layer is composed of a geographical location and the physical devices that constitute the environment. These devices can include hardware such as computers, switches, and routers. The devices that compose the physical layer can also include computing devices such as mobile phones, cars, airplanes, and ships. The physical layer also includes those devices used to facilitate cyber actions such as transoceanic cables, power stations, and buildings. Knowing the physical attributes of a target is often important when attempting to create cyber-kinetic responses. The physical structure of a network can provide clues as to the purpose of the network or point to vulnerabilities of constituent components of a network.\n\nBuilt upon the physical layer is a logical layer, which makes many of the aspects of the physical layer function. Firmware and software combine to form\n\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms",
    "The Role of Intelligence in Cyberspace [111]\n\na logical layer. Just as there are numerous components to the physical layer there are hundreds if not thousands of different software and firmware applications that combine to make cyberspace function. When targeting a system it is often necessary to have intelligence on the attributes of the system being attacked. A piece of malware designed for a Windows 7 OS zero-day vulnerability will not work if that malware is deployed to a computer running Mac OS X Yosemite.\n\nLastly, the combination of the physical and the logical layers make the social layer possible. Even if the network and the software layers are air-gapped and highly secure, the social layer, the layer where people interact with the computing device, can still offer up vulnerabilities, as was illustrated in the Stuxnet incident. Knowing who is using a device and how they perceive and interact with the world around them can open up a variety of vulnerabilities including social engineering and phishing. The social layer is composed of both the actual people and personalities using the computing devices and the cyber persona of the individual using a platform.\n\nAggregating outward, the layers of cyberspace and their attributes in the vernacular of international relations constitute capabilities. Capabilities can be broadly defined as including mechanisms of offensive and defensive military strength such as size and number of offensive cyber units. Capabilities can include doctrinal measures or indicators such as official cyber security and warfare doctrines and can include the size and complexity of systems and their connections to other systems of importance. And capabilities can include technical capabilities such as programming skill within the environment.\n\nThe capabilities matrix included below is overly simplified, yet it indicates a host of areas where the intelligence community can provide significant assistance to decision-makers. What is important to consider is that these capabilities are not limited to the United States or its allies. Capabilities need to be assessed on a nation-by-nation basis and on a substate basis as well. These and many other unmentioned cyber capabilities combine to provide an accurate picture of the battlespace.\n\nIdentifying the capabilities and political situation of a new battlespace is difficult under the best of circumstances. Cyber is immensely complicated and therefore necessitates a logical template within which to examine capabilities. There is a need for a differentiation between the domestic (defensive) and the foreign (offensive) battlespace. This distinction is important both for tasking and decision-making.

Again, following Waltz, a visualization of any battlespace includes the following:\n\n1. Developing a clear understanding of the state with relation to the enemy and environment.\n2. Envisioning a desired goal or objective representing the successful completion of the mission.\n3. Visualization of the sequence of activities that move the current state to the desired state.[30]\n\nEdward Amoroso argues the intelligence community should focus on creating an addition to the conventional intelligence briefs that consist solely of information pertaining to cyber.[31] Amoroso indicates such a report should focus on current security posture, top and new security risks, automated metrics, and human interpretation. Amoroso's case for the creation of a cyber-specific intelligence brief is sound and works toward promoting an accurate and realistic understanding of the threats and opportunities within this new and evolving domain relevant to national security.\n\n# POLICY CONSIDERATIONS\n\nThe Joint Chiefs of Staff have placed an increasing emphasis on the cyber domain within various joint doctrine publications. Joint doctrines provide insight into the needs of the services and policy-makers in the employment of and defense against cyber attacks. Documents also include many of the ways cyber\n\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms",
    "The Role of Intelligence in Cyberspace [113]\n\nhas come to rely heavily on intelligence assets. Information superiority has become a mission critical aspect of defending national security. The Department of Defense's \"Joint Doctrine for Command and Control Warfare\" dating back to 1996 highlights the importance of intelligence products in support of C2W. The document indicates the use of intelligence assists in the conceptualization of all aspects of a battlespace.\n\nComprehension of any battlespace, including the cyber domain, requires understanding the policy environment in which an action occurs. Is there a national cyber defense strategy within the targeted country? How have they publicly or privately declared they would respond to hostile acts within the cyber domain? An example of the policy environment can be found in the \"Department of Defense Strategy for Operating in Cyberspace.\" The strategy outlines five strategic initiatives in its declassified report:\n\nStrategic Initiative 1: Treat cyberspace as an operational domain to organize, train, and equip so that DoD can take full advantage of cyberspace's potential\n\nStrategic Initiative 2: Employ new defense operating concepts to protect DoD networks and systems\n\nStrategic Initiative 3: Partner with other U.S. government departments and agencies and the private sector to enable a whole-of-government cyber security strategy\n\nStrategic Initiative 4: Build robust relationships with U.S. allies and international partners to strengthen collective cyber security\n\nStrategic Initiative 5: Leverage the nation's ingenuity through an exceptional cyber workforce and rapid technological innovation\n\nThe recently declassified sections of the report cited in the media indicate a doctrinal shift in the way the DoD approaches the cyber domain. The Wall Street Journal reports that DoD sources as early as 2011 indicated that some instances of cyber attacks can constitute an act of war.[32] This has further developed as recently as September 2014 with the NATO pledge for mutual defense in the event of significant cyber attacks that might result in the invocation of Article 5.[33] When asked what constitutes an act of war in cyberspace that would rise to a level that would result in the successful invocation of Article 5 for mutual defense, NATO secretary general Rasmussen said that the goal was to achieve \"strategic ambiguity\" to keep adversaries guessing and to act as \"ambiguous deterrence.\"[34]\n\nAlthough the current position on what constitutes an act of war in cyberspace within the eyes of the United States and NATO remains uncertain, understanding the policy positions within the domestic battlespace and in the foreign battlespace helps alleviate information asymmetries and establish clearly identifiable patterns for response. Whether it is the knowledge that Germany and the Netherlands both have official cyber security doctrines or that China has begun implementing a policy of making offensive cyber capabilities a strategic priority,\n\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms",
    "CHAPTER SEVEN\n\nthe overt and covert collection of policy positions provides policy-makers with a foundation for understanding intelligence related to cyber.\n\nPolicy platforms also help to codify international law, to create zones of norms or an identifiable policy framework in which states will interact or respond to incidents emanating from cyberspace.³⁵ While both the United States and Russia have made known a cyber attack could constitute an act of war, there has been little elaboration on specific characteristics of such an attack within the official policy-making circles of government. Often states will intentionally leave room for policy ambiguity as a mechanism of deterrence.³⁶ Understanding ambiguity, information gaps, and information asymmetry is crucial particularly in comprehending how leaders arrive at decisions. As in conventional warfare, in cyber conflict the minimization of or the knowledge about what a potential adversary will do in a given situation provides a strategic edge. Although there has been little in the form of codified policy delineation on what level of cyber attack would constitute an act of war, the academic community has been heavily engaged in attempting to apply existing legal frameworks to the cyber domain. The most notable work in this arena is the Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare, which works through in rigorous detail how actions within cyberspace could fall within existing international law.³⁷ Yet as rigorous as the work is, there is no single government required to adhere to its findings on the applicability of international law, and even within the laws themselves there was a significant amount of debate as to what constituted various levels of action in cyberspace. Instead of thinking of sponsored academic works such as the Tallinn Manual as clear policies to which states should adhere, they should be instead thought of as roadmaps to guide states in developing policies.\n\n# CE—NETWORK MAPPING, SYSTEMIC DEPENDENCIES, AND HISTORICAL RECORDS\n\nUnderstanding the policy environment both domestically and among foreign adversaries is only part of the larger intelligence process. Cyber exploitation (CE) constitutes a series of technological and analytical approaches to cyber-specific espionage. CE for the purposes of conventional intelligence collection can include the penetration of foreign networks to secure information on weapons systems, policy positions, and much more. CE is invasive yet does not disrupt, deny, or destroy data; it collects data. When CE operations focus intelligence on the cyber domain for offensive and defensive purposes, the objective is to understand the systems themselves. The goal becomes identifying the strengths and weaknesses of systems, the connectivity of systems to points of interests, and the interaction of those systems with strategic and tactical objectives.\n\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms",
    "The Role of Intelligence in Cyberspace [115]\n\nThere are numerous methods of CE; for the purposes of simplicity only a few are examined here. Network mapping is a form of CE that studies the physical connectivity of networks or the availability of insecure ports. This type of mapping provides information on what types of systems and servers operate on different networks and identifies the characteristics of the various component parts these systems constitute. Network mapping can drill down to very low levels on particular networks and provide significant information speed and types of hardware on various networks. This information can also be used to isolate portions of networks to identify potential heavy traffic users or other sources of potential exploitation.\n\nNetwork mapping is also useful for illustrating the potential for any particular targeted attack to extend beyond its intended target and result in collateral damage or blowback. Conceptually network mapping is not dissimilar from attempting to map radar or surface-to-air missile locations prior to a bombing campaign. The intent of network mapping is to gain an operational knowledge of an adversary's systems prior to engaging in an OCO.\n\nForensic analysis of the Stuxnet worm found the worm partially employed network mapping to target its attacks, focusing on isolated networks using memory sticks as the initial method of transmission.[38] Once in, Stuxnet focused its attack on networks with programmable logic controllers (PLCs) of a specific type and caused uranium enrichment centrifuges to malfunction.[39] The level of sophistication required to drill down to get to this level of detail to plan an attack is remarkable, particularly considering the complexity and number of overall systems and the air-gapped nature of the systems.\n\nNetwork mapping is both an offensive and defensive intelligence endeavor. To adequately prepare both the defensive and offensive battlespaces, an accurate picture of systems is needed. Arguably the dual domestic-foreign pictures are complementary and help avoid violating part 2.13 of Executive Order 12333, which prevents any covert action from influencing U.S. political processes, public opinion, policies, media, or various sections of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.[40]\n\nNetwork mapping and monitoring is a double-edged sword. Legally network mapping can be considered CE, and therefore domestic network mapping by U.S. intelligence agencies without a warrant would be prohibited. However, network mapping is of critical importance to the maintenance of national security infrastructures. Thus far the intelligence community does not have a formal commitment from the White House or the Justice Department to engage in any domestic CE operations.[41] Currently in the United States there is an uneasy and inefficient public-private commitment to providing information on network security across critical infrastructure. A thorough understanding of domestic and foreign networks assists in visualization for both offensive and defensive\n\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms",
    "CHAPTER SEVEN\n\npurposes, and effort to push reasoned analysis of threats has begun to make its way into Congress.⁴²\n\nNetwork mapping assists in the identification of network components. Once network components are known, it becomes necessary to explore vulnerabilities within systems. Most damaging are zero-day vulnerabilities, which are vulnerabilities in computer applications of which even system administrators are unaware. The Stuxnet attack exposed several zero-day vulnerabilities in the Windows software controlling/monitoring the programmable logic controllers, causing the attached centrifuges to spin outside of their safe operational standards.\n\nSystemic vulnerabilities necessitate a thorough understanding of the historical record of different types of attacks and exploits. The identification of zero-day vulnerabilities should lead network administrators to immediately patch these gaps. Intelligence plays a role in identifying what types of attacks have been used in the past and what vulnerabilities these attacks attempted to exploit. Historical accounting is important for both offensive and defensive preparation of the battlespace. For obvious reasons it is important to prevent repeat attacks on domestic systems; at the same time it is important not to engage in repeat attack methods once a vulnerability on an opposing system has been fixed. Such an attack would likely be ineffective and lead to anonymity-attribution problems.\n\nThe historical accounting of attack types by countries and substate actors also alerts operators within the intelligence and military community to the threat spectrum capabilities of a particular cyber adversary. Understanding the threat spectrum capabilities of states facilitates an accurate conceptualization of their power to operate within the domain. Table 7.3 is a representation of known threat spectrum capabilities.\n\nThe above areas of consideration within CE are only a small sampling of the overall tasking priorities for intelligence using CE methods. They hint at a broad applicability for CYBERINT methods in the preparation of the battlespace.\n\n# CONVENTIONAL INTELLIGENCE\n\nIntelligence collected on budgetary allocations, offensive and defensive cyber unit sizes, and training methodologies provides the clearest parallel to conventional intelligence. As in conventional intelligence, most countries are frequently unwilling to release data on absolute military expenditures or the sizes and force structures within their military. Military capabilities are a closely guarded secret in most countries. Capabilities are particularly secretive in the cyber domain. Often if cyber capabilities are exposed, they cease to be capabilities.⁴³ Once Stuxnet was discovered by the Iranians, defensive measures were taken to \"plug\" the holes the Stuxnet attack employed. This dramatically reduces\n\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms",

Whereas missiles can be launched with repeated success because the ability to defend against a moving projectile is difficult, a similar cyber weapon is more easily defended against once it has been identified. Antivirus software can be reprogrammed to identify and isolate repeat threats, and zero-day vulnerabilities can be patched.\n\nAn excellent example of an open source analysis of cyber capabilities comes from Stokes, Lin, and Hsiao, who examine in explicit detail the construction, location, leadership, and mission of many aspects of the Chinese People's Liberation Army information warfare programs.⁴⁴ Their report is an example of a high-value detailed analysis that could be supplemented by conventional intelligence to enhance policy-maker and combatant commander comprehension of the battlespace. The detailed analysis of the location and force structure can cause an enemy to shift its tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and make them less reliable. Alternatively, not revealing that information has been gained on TTPs can provide an offensive edge in cyber operations.\n\nThe implications for conventional intelligence collection methods indicate that intelligence on cyber does not necessarily need to remain cyberbound or exclusively within the realm of CE. Many metrics such as force size matter in cyber and can be examined to create a better assessment of potential adversaries. Cyber force size is particularly important from a malware development perspective. Complex coding scripts typically necessitate large numbers of programmers to develop and test the scripts. The ability for an individual to accomplish highly complex attacks is possible but less likely than a large cyber warfare unit working with the same objective.\n\nLikewise, knowing where a unit is located or how programmers were trained can help planners determine the best response to a particular attack, or how best to manipulate their organizational structure. Derek Clark and Kai Konrad refer to this as identifying the weakest link.⁴⁵ The identification of the weakest link is particularly important in cyber defense and offense. There are multiple fronts (systems) needing defense. All it takes is one \"best shot\" to achieve significant damage. While this weakest link can be identified through CE operations outlined in the previous section, it can also be identified within the training, command, and organizational structure of units charged with conducting or protecting against cyber attacks.\n\nClosely related to the conventional military metrics above, yet likely unique to the cyber domain, are public-private ICT collaborations. Although most countries have programs for military public and private collaborations with universities and businesses for research and development, within the cyber domain the importance of this relationship is magnified for multiple reasons. First, much of the training and education necessary to conduct offensive or defensive oper\n\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms",
    "The Role of Intelligence in Cyberspace [119]\n\nations within cyberspace can be learned at public institutions or can be crafted for private sector use. This extends far beyond the development of technology to the actual training of the warfighter, the development of the platforms upon which the domain rests, and more. Second, these collaborations spread out but do not diffuse potential vulnerabilities.\n\nBecause collaborations can form the foundational aspects of the cyber warriors within offensive and defensive units, they can train, equip, and prepare in ways far different from conventional military means. Most countries have a balance between civilian and military protection of their national cyber infrastructures based largely on the development of computer emergency response teams (CERTs). An intelligence assessment of the strength and quality of ICT collaborations is of critical importance in understanding the cyber battlespace.\n\nICT collaborations are not necessarily official and do not need to be highly structured and regimented. Alexander Klimburg provides evidence Russia and China have created groups of plausibly deniable cyber attackers.[46] Creating an accurate open source measure of unofficial collaborations is difficult. An intelligence focus on unofficial collaborations with entities can contextualize cyber incidents such as the 2007 cyber attacks directed at Estonian governmental, bank, and communications websites.[47] The attacks were motivated by a decision to move a Russian war memorial from central Tallinn. While initial reports indicated Russia was the culprit, Russia denied any participation in the cyber attacks.[48] The reality is somewhat murkier and more akin to an unofficial sanction or condoning of cyber attacks by the Russian government.[49]\n\nThe collection and production of intelligence on more conventional attributes of pertinence to the cyber domain is a role in which the intelligence community is likely already engaged. Occasionally reports on issues relating to this category of intelligence are published for public consumption. A recent report of this type was produced for the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission to examine China's capability to conduct cyber warfare and cyber exploitation.[50] Knowledge of capabilities is still applicable to the cyber domain and is greatly influenced by conventional intelligence collection methods and subsequent analysis, which contextualizes the meaning of raw intelligence.\n\n## HUMINT AND CYBER\n\nHuman intelligence (HUMINT) stands out in cyber for two particular reasons. First, HUMINT agents can provide accurate internal information on systems and access to those systems unavailable through CE and other intelligence collection methods. Second, human assets can serve as a bridge between the external world and air-gapped or other forms of secure networks. As was indicated above, it is likely that the Stuxnet virus was distributed using a thumb drive,\n\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms",
    "CHAPTER SEVEN\n\nwhich needed to be inserted into a machine within an air-gapped network. HUMINT agents can serve as a vulnerability against which most network administrators will be unable to provide significant protection.\n\nThe role of a HUMINT asset with access to information on networks can be extremely damaging. Even if the agent is on a lightly classified network, the repercussions of his or her actions can be enormous. The scandal caused by Bradley Manning (now named Chelsea Manning) leaking more than 260,000 diplomatic cables to WikiLeaks in 2010 is illustrative of the problem posed by internal threats.⁵¹ Manning’s leak and the even more damaging 2013 document releases by Edward Snowden, a former employee of a contractor affiliated with both the NSA and CIA, highlight the potential damage a rogue employee can have on the ability of the intelligence community to keep information secret.⁵² Snowden’s insider collection and subsequent release of documents pertaining to the National Security Agency likely constitutes one of the most significant intelligence leaks of all time and resulted in an estimated 1.7 million documents being released in violation of U.S. classification law.⁵³ Moreover, unlike the leaks by Manning, the Snowden leaks revealed many of the TTPs used by the NSA in its intelligence operations in the cyber domain. These revelations have been extremely damaging and have resulted in changes in the way adversaries safeguard their cyber infrastructure.\n\nHUMINT threats need to be developed and enhanced for offensive intelligence and protected against for domestic national security counterintelligence. Gaining access to the technical schematics, documents, information, login procedures, or any of a multitude of other targets of intelligence a HUMINT asset could provide is a critical aspect added directly by intelligence to the understanding of the cyber domain. Furthermore, HUMINT agents are almost impossible to detect under normal circumstances as they can often engage in significant espionage while still easily performing the normal duties. Unlike the spy thriller days of old when agents had to sneak out of a building with classified documents in a folder or a box, they can often place thousands or millions of documents on a solid-state drive and easily conceal it upon exiting a facility. Many of these drives are smaller in size than a penny.\n\nBeyond the collection of intelligence from HUMINT sources, these insiders can assist in the implementation of cyber actions. Information within a 2005 report by the U.S. Secret Service in cooperation with Carnegie Mellon indicated that up to 29 percent of all attacks against a surveyed group of critical infrastructure stakeholders were initiated by insiders.⁵⁴ The majority of motivations behind these attacks were not related to intelligence or covert action. This, however, does not preclude the possibility of using insiders to affect or gain information or access on adversary systems. The recruitment and maintenance of insider threats by the intelligence community should be a top priority.

All of the intelligence collection methods and the focus of the intel process of trying to comprehend the cyber domain culminate in understanding, from a mission critical orientation, the progression of cyber attacks. Figure 7.1 is a simplified model for understanding attack planning and progression within a battlespace modeled loosely on the JP 3-51 electronic warfare-planning model.[55] This model is informed by intelligence collection. Line one of the figure indicates a policy-maker's perspective on the process of engaging in conflict. A conflict initiation is (o) planned, (1) implemented, and (2) completed. Policy-makers want to know what resources any given action will take and how long it will take to complete it. In cyber a more accurate timeline for action in cyberspace requires (o) intelligence collection, (1) operational planning of the attack with an informed knowledge of the battlespace, (2) understanding of the time it takes for the attack to be completed, (3) how long until the attack is recognized as an attack by the adversary, (4) how long until that adversary can do something about the attack, (5) how long until the adversary assigns attribution for the attack. The ordering of the items listed above greatly affects the ability for an attack to be conducted successfully. Intelligence informs the policy-maker and commander as to the feasibility of a particular type of attack and the probability of success. If recognition of an attack occurs early in the timeline of events the probability of success is diminished.\n\nThe timeline can be tested in much the same way conventional weapons are tested. It would be absurd to send a bomber over a potential target with a completely untested bomb, or to send a soldier into battle with an untested model of rifle. Just as weapons are tested in the physical world, they need to be tested in the cyber domain as well. This testing provides added information to both\n\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms",

Waltz, Information Warfare.\n\nthe policy-maker and the combatant commander as to the effectiveness of the weapon and the timeline of events above. If a cyber weapon is slow and easily detectable, its probability for success is diminished. This lowered probability for success does not nullify its use but does condition it.\n\nOne aspect of this phase of IPB is that it is extremely beneficial to both the offensive and defensive strategic and tactical operations. By planning and testing potential attacks against theoretical adversarial systems, the intelligence community provides an out-of-the-box perspective necessary to prevent similar attacks against domestic targets. This logic would indicate an attempt to use a worm like Stuxnet against the U.S. infrastructure would run into greater problems than if the weapon had been developed first elsewhere.\n\n# IPB AND ITS IMPACT ON CYBER\n\nThe role of intelligence in cyber is not dissimilar from its role in the conventional domains. There are new areas in which collection and analysis need to occur, yet its overall objective remains the same. Returning to Edward Waltz's concept of information preparation of the battlefield, figure 7.2 illustrates intelligence's influence on operations originating within the cyber domain. The role of intelligence in cyber is to accurately facilitate an understanding of those\n\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms",
    "The Role of Intelligence in Cyberspace [123]\n\nentities and the possible tools by which to influence them. The cyber domain is surrounded with hype and hysteria. Many of the claims are accurately based in reality. But the known unknowns are still enormous within this evolving domain, and it is incumbent on intelligence to provide an accurate assessment of the current state of affairs.\n\nAll-source intelligence for cyber operations requires the intelligence community to think beyond domestic system defense. The focus should be balanced between foreign and domestic intelligence, thereby mutually informing one another and creating a systemic defense for national assets in addition to better facilitating decision-makers with a more accurate picture of how a potential cyber attack might succeed or fail.\n\n# CYBER AS COVERT ACTION\n\nTo further define the role of intelligence in cyber, it is necessary to look more deeply into the laws codifying the conduct of the intelligence community. All of the above sections provide a framework for defining the role of intelligence with regard to IPB. Cyber conflict is, by its very nature, covert. Even if an attack is discovered, it is often unattributable. Attacks can be designed to go unnoticed and affect changes to systems and their components for days, weeks, or months without detection. Even in instances where groups such as Anonymous publically take credit for attacks, responsibility is typically claimed post hoc. Nearly all examples of state-on-state cyber attacks have been covert.\n\nThe covert nature of cyber brings full circle Warner's definition of intelligence as attempting to influence. Covert action is a secret operation to influence a foreign entity. At least in theory, most, if not all, cyber attacks begin covertly. Section 1.7(a)(4) of Executive Order 12333 regarding intelligence activities describes covert action:\n\nConduct convert action activities approved by the President. No agency except the Central Intelligence Agency (or the Armed Forces of the United States in time of war declared by the Congress or during any period covered by a report from the President to the Congress consistent with the War Powers Resolution, Public Law 93-148) may conduct any covert action activity unless the President determines that another agency is more likely to achieve a particular objective.[56]\n\nEvident in the early structuring of the governmental approach to cyberspace is the categorization of cyber operations as covert actions. The Department of Defense originally took the lead with General Keith Alexander as the head of both NSA and Cyber Command, a path that has continued now that Admiral Michael Rogers has taken over as the head of both organizations. This indicates the president has established an agency other than the Central Intelligence\n\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms",
    "CHAPTER SEVEN\n\nAgency as the primary covert operator within this domain. While the logic behind having a military intelligence organization commander and an organizational structure that falls under the U.S. Strategic Command (STRATCOM) runs counter to EO 12333, the institutional capacity of the DoD in the technical domain and the scale of the problem being faced within this new domain make the assignment appropriate.\n\n# SUMMARIZING THE ROLE OF INTELLIGENCE WITHIN THE CYBER DOMAIN\n\nIn defining the role of intelligence within the cyber domain, it is necessary to take a holistic approach. From a collection perspective, the intelligence community should be and has been working in coordination with a hybrid push-and-pull intelligence cycle to both elevate the importance of this domain and facilitate collection within it. The emphasis has been heavily defensive up to this point and largely focused on countering threats rather than anticipating them. This needs to change, and the only way this can change is if the intelligence community begins to actively turn its sights on adversaries and develop more rigorous all-source intelligence combining novel CYBERINT technologies to augment reporting on this domain. Parroting Amoroso's assertion, cyber should be included on the daily intelligence briefs of policy-makers. The inclusion would likely start the process of demystification of this immensely complicated domain.\n\nCyberspace is a domain that can be used to fulfill all aspects of Warner's definition of intelligence to some degree. It is a domain in which it is possible to gain understanding about other states beyond and within the domain itself, but it is also a domain that can influence other states' policy decisions as well as perceptions. In particular, accurate intelligence on both sides of the domestic-foreign divide can mutually inform decision-makers about vulnerabilities and the eventual decision to use cyber as an offensive weapon or how best to defend against attacks. Moreover, intelligence can rein in the debate on cyber to a more realistic area of operations predicated on sound estimates rather than on grandiose speculation.\n\nThe intelligence community itself commonly is the point of origin for OCOs emanating from the cyber domain and will likely serve as a force multiplier in instances where a combined conventional cyber attack is necessary. To engage in cyber conflict, just as in conventional conflict, intelligence is needed to prepare the battlespace and facilitate an accurate assessment of the probability for success and utility for any type of operation. This preparation hones the weapons, decisions, and effect of a potential operation. More importantly for national security, a thorough and accurate preparation of both the foreign and domestic battlespaces will serve to inform and enhance cyber security.\n\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.237 on Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:15:02 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms"
