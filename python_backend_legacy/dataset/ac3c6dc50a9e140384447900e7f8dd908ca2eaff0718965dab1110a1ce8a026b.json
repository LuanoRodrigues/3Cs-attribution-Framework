Without fanfare or warning, Americans awake to find that nothing works. In Wellesley, Massachusetts, sixth graders at Horatio H. Hunnewell Elementary School on Cameron Street awoke later than usual because alarm clocks failed to provide their normal wake-up call. Meanwhile, just a few miles away in South Boston, the fire fighters of Engine Company 39, Ladder 18 receive delayed notice of homes ablaze because the phone system is down. First responders arrive at their destinations later than normal because traffic lights are not functioning. Everywhere this morning, fire fighters are busy dealing with fires, hamstrung because fire hydrants are not operational due to electrical outages that cause pumps to fail. Those individuals reliant on electrical medical devices are struggling, and confusion is widespread.\n\nThis Tuesday morning, the electrical grids in the eastern and western United States fail.⁶ As a result, all states except for Texas, Alaska and Hawaii (which have their own grids) are without power. The government declares a state of emergency and promises to locate the problem and restore services as soon as possible. Emergency generators provide power for some essential services such as hospitals and public broadcasters. However, schools are closed, and public transportation proves intermittent at best. Inoperable traffic signals cause automobile travel to slow to a snail’s pace in major cities. Phone landlines are down for most businesses. Cell towers don’t work because of power loss. Some people use this “holiday” from work and school to venture out for necessities. However, stocked groceries and operating gas stations prove hard to come by since few sources have their own power generators. Most restaurants are unable to open due to lack of electricity and public transportation for their employees.

But this morning, no spinach &amp; feta omelets are served. Like Florida, southern Texas and Arizona, the West Coast—particularly southern California—benefits from a climate that is hospitable even during February. At the macro level, widespread losses of electrical power result in store closures and quicker defrost and spoilage of existing grocery store foodstuffs. The inability to pump gas at most service stations quickly results in long lines of cars waiting to fuel at the few open gas stations (before resupply trucks fail to make deliveries). Abandoned cars left on streets and highways soon become a major problem for the already congested Los Angeles area.\n\nIn northern California, Sandhill Road in Menlo Park, just a few minutes from Stanford University, is “ground zero” for America’s venture capital industry. This morning, many pillars of venture finance find themselves locked out of their offices when front door electronic security devices fail to operate. Classes are cancelled at Stanford, and lunch will not be served today along Fisherman’s Wharf in San Francisco.\n\nEven during February, the impact of global warming and wildfires prove to be problematic this year in the western United States.

Commerce ceases nationwide as the power grid continues to stay down. Backup systems powered by fossil fuels soon deplete their supplies of coal, gas, diesel, kerosene, *et cetera*.

But this time, things are different.\n\nIt’s been almost ten days now since electricity went out across forty-seven states. For a while, hospitals are okay with their backup power sources. Within a week or so, many start to run out of fuel to power their generators. At first, elective surgeries are postponed. Several days later as power becomes increasingly scarce, medical monitoring machines fail and lab testing stops. Doctors, nurses, and other healthcare workers cannot make their way between home and work. By now, most hospitals are desperately understaffed, without fuel or other sources of functioning power. Many hospitals simply fail and services stop, with no place to send their patients. The sick start to die and bodies pile up. Without electricity, gas stations cannot pump gas, streetlights and traffic signals are dark, and those who can make it through the snow soon empty grocery stores of all remaining usable food.\n\nAt sub-freezing temperatures; humans and their habitats are in peril. As buildings shed their heat, staying warm becomes a challenge. The elderly and the very young succumb first. After the first few days, finding fire for warmth becomes difficult and causes panic. After firewood supplies are consumed, all things paper, and even fine furniture, are burned for warmth. Staying warm in large cities proves particularly challenging. The silent killer of carbon monoxide poisoning leads to accidental deaths.²⁷\n\nWhen elevators fail to work, having navigated many flights of stairs in the dark to get home, many of those living in apartment buildings stay inside. It takes days for emergency workers to rescue those caught in stalled elevators when the power failed. Fire becomes an unchecked inferno, as desperate city dwellers create fires from anything that will burn. In the absence of vital emergency services, these fires inevitably become uncontrollable. First buildings, then entire neighborhoods, burn out of control.\n\n²⁷ April Kahn, *What Is Carbon Monoxide Poisoning?*, HEALTHLINE (Dec. 1 2015), http://www.healthline.com/health/carbon-monoxide-poisoning#Overview1.",

Many resourceful residents in Evanston and the more affluent suburbs use their gas fireplaces for cooking. However, this proves to be much easier to do in theory than in practice. Before long, cooking grease results in fires and dangerous and painful burns. Similar human misery is found throughout the mid-west as cities like Detroit, Cleveland, Columbus and St. Louis quickly stall to a frozen halt.\n\n## In the South\n\nThose in warmer climates find survival moderately easier. In rural areas, crops and livestock provide sustenance. Many revert to those survival skills typical of life on the prairie two hundred years earlier. Even worse than the gas lines of the 1970s, service station fuel pumps fail for lack of electrical power, and transportation soon stops as cars are rendered useless due to lack of fuel. Railroad and truck food distribution systems in the South also fail, and the population soon grows hungry. Hunting and fishing moves from being a hobby to a necessity, and survival gains a renewed importance in daily life. Particularly in densely populated areas, household pets soon disappear, along with the residents of many local zoos. Animal shelters everywhere are no longer needed. Easy availability of firearms results in a rapid shift of vital resources between the “haves” and “have nots.”\n\nAs the homeless have known for years, survival in warmer climates, such as in Florida, is easier during the winter. Unlike the frozen northeast, it is actually possible to sleep outdoors during the winter.

According to Fugate,\n\nThat means we need to have enough power to pump, treat, and distribute water through the system. You have to keep the water system up, and you’ve gotta [sic] then focus on the water treatment system. Backing up sewage is just about as bad.

Tokyo to the ambassador in Washington declared: There is more reason than ever before for us to arm ourselves to the teeth for all-out war.”⁵⁴ Moreover,\n\nIn the first week of December, 1941, the U.S. learned that the Japanese government gave instructions to its Washington embassy to start destroying its codes, a clear sign that diplomatic relations were about to be broken. On December 6 through 7, U.S. code breakers intercepted a 14-part message, the so-called ‘War Warning,’ which ended with orders to break off any further talks with the Americans at precisely 1:00 p.m. Washington time (7:30 a.m. Hawaii time) on December 7.⁵⁵\n\nAmerican code-breaker and mathematics teacher Frank Rowlett observes, “As I look back at all the messages and other information available to us . . . it becomes crystal clear to me that this message ordering the destruction of certain of Washington’s codes provided the necessary evidence . . . which would make war between the United States and Japan a certainty.”⁵⁶ Pearl Harbor had not been protected. As Kahn writes, “Japan had sealed all possible leaks. The ambassadors in Washington were not told of the attacks. Knowledge of it was limited in Toyko to as tight a circle as possible . . . No reference to a raid on Pearl Harbor ever went on the air, even coded.”⁵⁷ In a tragedy of errors, “[d]isorganization and divided responsibility had cost America dearly.”⁵⁸ It had taken fifteen and a half hours after message No.\n\n⁵⁴ See Kahn, supra note 52.\n\n⁵⁵ KROSS, supra note 53, at 269.; see also FRED B.

Therefore, the knowledge most U.S. citizens have about Pearl Harbor comes from history books and may seem increasingly remote as the years pass. For many families, the oral histories passed down by parents and grandparents are how many contemporary Americans remember and learn about Pearl Harbor.

Tactical information victories, such as the information skirmishes that preceded the Battle of Midway, highlighted the increasing interaction of advanced communications technologies with strategic deception tactics for operational advantage.”⁶⁷ As Professor Chris Bronk observes, “[h]ow states behave with regard to the Internet appears to matter more and more within international affairs . . . [and] Internet conflict may be a new area of international behavior falling somewhere between diplomacy and military action.”⁶⁸\n\nWhile a detailed discussion of the law of cyberwar is beyond the scope of this paper, any threshold inquiry must start with the question, “What exactly constitutes ‘warfare?’” According to Nineteenth century military theorist Carl von Clausewitz, an act of war requires that aggressive or defensive conduct be (1) “violent or potentially violent, (2) “instrumental: [where] physical violence or the threat of force is a means to compel the enemy to accept the attacker’s will,” and (3) “attributable to one side at some point\n\n⁶⁴ MICHAEL MCCAUL, FAILURES OF IMAGINATION: THE DEADLIEST THREATS TO OUR HOMELAND—AND HOW TO THWART THEM 5 (New York: Crown Forum 2016).\n\n⁶⁵ GEORGE SANTAYANA, THE LIFE OF REASON OR THE PHASES OF PROGRESS 284 (Charles Scribner’s Sons 1905).\n\n⁶⁶ See JULIE RYAN, LEADING ISSUES IN INFORMATION WARFARE AND SECURITY RESEARCH vii (ACPI, 2015).\n\n⁶⁷ Id.\n\n⁶⁸ See Christopher Bronk, Blown to Bits: China’s War in Cyberspace, August-September 2020, 5 STRAT.

Actions online affect actions offline, and vice versa. Thus, far from being separate from conventional war, as Rid [contends], cyberwar is deeply embedded in contemporary military practices.”⁷¹ Moreover, “[c]yberwar, in fact, is part of the evolution of conventional warfare, which itself is linked to broader social and political change . . .”⁷²\n\nIn addition to causing physical injury or death, violence can refer to mental abuse and different forms of deprivation. The academic discipline of peace studies has for decades advanced the concept of structural violence, such as racism and sexism. In its widest sense, then, violence can be found in almost any coercive situation. And the various attacks and activities associated with cyberwar, from stealing data to disrupting other governments’ computer systems, clearly fall within this broad category.⁷³\n\nThis debate, carried out in the pages of *Foreign Affairs*,⁷⁴ includes Thomas Rid’s concurrence that cyberspace activities are indeed “an inherent part of conventional warfare . . .

The key elements of war in cyberspace all have their parallels and connections to warfare in other domains . . . war always has a political goal and mode (which distinguishes it from crime) and always has an element of violence.”77 For example, “the US government’s position is that to meet this definition of the use of force, a cyberattack would have to ‘proximately result in death, injury or significant destruction.’ That is, even if conducted through cyber means, the effect must be physical damage or destruction.”78\n\nHouse Homeland Security Chairman Michael McCaul reflected on the 9/11 Commission’s “lack of readiness;” finding, where\n\n75 See Thomas Rid, *Is Cyberwar Real?: Gauging the Threats/Rid Replies*, FOREIGN AFF., Mar.–Apr. 2014, at 167.

For example,\n\nIn 2007, U.S. soldiers took smartphone photos of a group of new U.S. Army helicopters parked at a base in Iraq and then uploaded them to the Internet. The helicopters weren't classified and the photos showed no seemingly useful information to the enemy. But the soldiers didn't realize the photos also included \"geotags,\" which revealed where the photographers had been standing.

Coupled with Internet adoption patterns, we are witnessing a dramatic shift in the size, complexity, and diversity of cyber security attacks.”¹⁰³ Before Congress, Kurose testified that the United States:\n\nNeeds to continue its investments in game-changing research if our cyber systems are to be trustworthy now and in the future. As you know, every day, we learn about more sophisticated and dangerous attacks. Why is the cyber security challenge so hard? The general answer is that attacks and defenses co-evolve: a system that was secure yesterday might no longer be secure tomorrow. More specific responses to this question include:\n\n- The technology base of our critical infrastructure systems is frequently updated to improve functionality, availability, and/or performance. New systems introduce new vulnerabilities (unknowable in the lab) that need new defenses when put into practice.\n\n- The environments in which our computing systems are rapidly developed and deployed, and the functionality that they provide are also not static. With entirely new computing models/platforms, like cloud and mobile computing, come new content and function, which in turn create new opportunities and incentives for attack and disruption.\n\n- As the automation of complex system interdependencies comes to pervade our critical infrastructure, new kinds of cascading vulnerabilities can be accidentally created and subsequently discovered in these systems, including the electric power grid, automated transportation networks, and robotic medical systems.\n\n- The sophistication of attackers is increasing as well as their sheer number and the specificity of their targets.\n\n- As information and systems are increasingly connected, and are increasingly composed of software and hardware\n\n¹⁰³ *Id.*",

System developers, purchasers, operators and users all have a role to play in system security, and ways to incentivize positive behaviors are required. Security mechanisms that are not convenient will be circumvented; security mechanisms that are difficult to understand will be ignored or misinterpreted. Indeed, cyber security is a multi-dimensional challenge, requiring expertise in computer science, mathematics, economics, behavioral sciences, and education.¹⁰⁴\n\nIn Congressional testimony given on March 4, 2015, Navy Admiral Michael S. Rogers, commander of the U.S. Cyber Command and director of the National Security Agency, stated:\n\nEvery conflict in the world today has a cyber dimension ... The most worrisome of these campaigns are state-sponsored, persistent, and worldwide in scope. They are aimed at governments, non-profits, and corporations wherever they might be accruing intellectual capital that the attackers believe could be valuable, whether for re-sale or passage to competing firms and industries ... We see states developing capabilities and attaining accesses for potential hostilities, perhaps with the idea of enhancing deterrence or as a beachhead for future cyber sabotage.

And the same technologies we use to target cruise missiles and jam enemy air defenses can be used against our own forces—and they’re now available to the highest bidder.”¹⁰⁶ Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Navy Admiral James A.

We only add 4 percent worth of ‘special sauce.’¹⁰⁷ That means adversaries can quickly copy advanced U.S. systems with globally sourced components.”¹⁰⁸ Ash Carter warned that “[w]hether it’s in the cloud, infrared cameras, or the GPS signals that provide navigation for ride-sharing apps, but also for aircraft carriers and our smart bombs—our reliance on technology has led to real vulnerabilities that our adversaries are eager to exploit.”¹⁰⁹\n\nSecretary of Defense, Ash Carter, explains nation-states, terrorist, and criminal networks are “increasing their cyber operations.

Building these nuclear forces and the policy and support structures around them took time and did not cause a nuclear war or make the world less safe. On the contrary, it made deterrence predictable, helped to lower tensions, and ultimately facilitated arms control negotiations.

Just as we fashioned a formidable nuclear capability that served us through the Cold War and beyond, I am confident in our ability to keep pace with adversaries who are determined to control “their” corners of cyberspace, to exfiltrate our intellectual property, and to disrupt the functioning of our institutions. They are every bit as determined, creative, and persistent in these efforts as the Soviet leaders we contained during the Cold War, and unfortunately we see few hints they will act more responsibly in cyberspace.

Since they are not taught any history of their field, many accordingly fail to distinguish between what is actually new versus what is just new to them. In addition, cyberspace not only has many characteristics which are non-intuitive to (older) policymakers, but it seems to be forever changing...

[And] in the earnest hope that something constructive may be accomplished that will aid our national defense and preclude a repetition of the disaster of December 7, 1941.”¹⁹⁰ As our strategy evolves to detect, mitigate, and fight cyberattacks, reflection upon these principles, and how, if at all, they may differ in today’s rapidly changing technological environment, may prove helpful. The principles are as follows:\n\n1. Operational and intelligence work requires centralization of authority and clear-cut allocation of responsibility.\n2. Supervisory officials cannot safely take anything for granted in the alerting of subordinates.\n3. Any doubt as to whether outposts should be given information should always be resolved in favor of supplying the information.\n4. The delegation of authority or the issuance of orders entails the duty of inspection to determine that the official mandate is properly exercised.\n5.

First, is a possible scenario of such a cyberattack. Second, for historical perspective, the December 7, 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor is presented. Third is a review of contemporary and credible warnings. Fourth is a discussion about the privacy versus national security debate, and geopolitical developments that might determine how a cyber drama is played-out on the world stage. Fifth, the question of what is to be done is addressed. Next, the 1946 Congressional Joint Committee on the Investigation of the Pearl Harbor Attack’s recommended principles (designed to prevent the repetition of such a future attack) is reviewed with our contemporary environment in mind.\n## II.

It’s a Tuesday morning in February. Without fanfare or warning, Americans awake to find that nothing works. In Wellesley, Massachusetts, sixth graders at Horatio H. Hunnewell Elementary School on Cameron Street awoke later than usual because alarm clocks failed to provide their normal wake-up call. Meanwhile, just a few miles away in South Boston, the fire fighters of Engine Company 39, Ladder 18 receive delayed notice of homes ablaze because the phone system is down. First responders arrive at their destinations later than normal because traffic lights are not functioning. Everywhere this morning, fire fighters are busy dealing with fires, hamstrung because fire hydrants are not operational due to electrical outages that cause pumps to fail. Those individuals reliant on electrical medical devices are struggling, and confusion is widespread.\nThis Tuesday morning, the electrical grids in the eastern and western United States fail.⁶ As a result, all states except for Texas, Alaska and Hawaii (which have their own grids) are without power. The government declares a state of emergency and promises to locate the problem and restore services as soon as possible. Emergency generators provide power for some essential services such as hospitals and public broadcasters. However, schools are closed, and public transportation proves intermittent at best. Inoperable traffic signals cause automobile travel to slow to a snail’s pace in major cities. Phone landlines are down for most businesses. Cell towers don’t work because of power loss. Some people use this “holiday” from work and school to venture out for necessities. However, stocked groceries and operating gas stations prove hard to come by since few sources have their own power generators. Most restaurants are unable to open due to lack of electricity and public transportation for their employees. With memories of 9/11 and the use of air transportation for purposes of\n⁶ See generally TED KOPPEL, LIGHTS OUT: A CYBERATTACK; A NATION UNPREPARED; SURVIVING THE AFTERMATH (Crown Pub., 2015) (depicting a future attack on U.S. power grids and its aftermath).

All originating air travel is cancelled, resulting in the stranding of travelers numbering in the tens of thousands, usually at unfamiliar airports. Even so, just before all aircraft could land, reports of compromised aircraft control systems are reported. Also, within recent memory are the terrorist attacks at Fort Hood,⁸ the Boston Marathon,⁹ Paris,¹⁰ San Bernardino,¹¹ and Brussels.¹²\n⁷ See generally Derek Jinks, September 11 and the Laws of War, 28 YALE J.

But this morning, no spinach &amp; feta omelets are served. Like Florida, southern Texas and Arizona, the West Coast—particularly southern California—benefits from a climate that is hospitable even during February. At the macro level, widespread losses of electrical power result in store closures and quicker defrost and spoilage of existing grocery store foodstuffs. The inability to pump gas at most service stations quickly results in long lines of cars waiting to fuel at the few open gas stations (before resupply trucks fail to make deliveries). Abandoned cars left on streets and highways soon become a major problem for the already congested Los Angeles area.\nIn northern California, Sandhill Road in Menlo Park, just a few minutes from Stanford University, is “ground zero” for America’s venture capital industry. This morning, many pillars of venture finance find themselves locked out of their offices when front door electronic security devices fail to operate. Classes are cancelled at Stanford, and lunch will not be served today along Fisherman’s Wharf in San Francisco.\nEven during February, the impact of global warming and wildfires prove to be problematic this year in the western United States. Lack of transportation hinders both first responder emergency services, such as firefighting efforts, and the ability to move agricultural products to heavily populated areas.

Frightened people quickly resort to desperate measures.\nFor California, as in most of the United States, most component parts of the electrical grid are now many decades old. Critically important for transferring electrical power between circuits, large power transformers average forty years old, with many in operation for an excess of seventy years.¹³ After power failures from disasters such as Hurricane Sandy on the U.S. east coast, the grid’s “reliability, effectiveness, and affordability are increasingly being brought into question.”¹⁴ However, not enough was done to fix the grid.\n## National Capital Area\nThis morning, breakfast is not available at the Hay Adams Hotel across from the White House. Nor were the doors open for business at Busboys and Poets at 2021 14th Street, NW.¹⁵ All the typical tourist attractions like the Smithsonian Museums remain closed, along with public schools. Classes are cancelled at American, Catholic, Georgetown, George Washington, Howard, and the University of the District of Columbia.\nThe bureaucratic army of the Potomac is estimated to employ over 500,000 federal workers, not counting the thousands of lawyers and consultants that perform work primarily for the U.S. government.¹⁶ Almost all remain at home this day.

This submarine fiber optic network is “the physical infrastructure that underpins the virtual cloud of cyberspace.”²⁰ Since its advent in 1977, the fiber optic cable system has experienced rampant growth. Thomas Friedman observes, “around the year 2000 we entered a whole new era, Globalization 3.0 . . . [which brings] the newfound power for individuals to collaborate and compete globally.”²¹ Friedman contends this development allows rapid circulation of digital content at almost no cost, thus creating global collaboration. Therefore, “[g]lobalization 3.0 is going to be more and more driven not only by individuals but also by a much more diverse—non-western, non white—group of individuals. Individuals from every corner of the flat world are being empowered.”²²\n---\n¹⁷ *Contact Us*, NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY, https://www.nsa.gov/about/contact-us/ (last visited Nov. 17, 2016).\n¹⁸ *Contact CIA*, CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY, https://www.cia.gov/index.html# (last visited Nov. 17, 2016).\n¹⁹ Barbara Maranzani, 9 *Things You May Not Know About the Pentagon*, HISTORY.COM (Jan. 15, 2013), http://www.history.com/news/9-things-you-may-not-know-about-the-pentagon.\n²⁰ Tara Davenport, *Submarine Cables, Cybersecurity and International Law: An Intersectional Analysis*, 24 CATH.

Almost overnight, money has no meaning; bartering replaces currency for transactions, and the American economy grinds to a halt. Banks are closed, and ATM machines fail to operate.\nDown on Wall Street, although emergency backup systems are capable of trading securities, orders to buy or sell are not received in New York, as Boston area brokerage offices lack telephone service and have no ability to communicate. Commerce ceases nationwide as the power grid continues to stay down. Backup systems powered by fossil fuels soon deplete their supplies of coal, gas, diesel, kerosene, *et cetera*. Much like the great blizzard of 2015, snow is piled up everywhere.²⁶ Schools have not reopened since Zero Day. Public transportation remains closed. After several days, snow removal is finally abandoned for lack of fuel and because workers choose to be at home with their families.\n²³ Davenport, *supra* note 20, at 62 (citing G.A.

But this time, things are different.\nIt’s been almost ten days now since electricity went out across forty-seven states. For a while, hospitals are okay with their backup power sources. Within a week or so, many start to run out of fuel to power their generators. At first, elective surgeries are postponed. Several days later as power becomes increasingly scarce, medical monitoring machines fail and lab testing stops. Doctors, nurses, and other healthcare workers cannot make their way between home and work. By now, most hospitals are desperately understaffed, without fuel or other sources of functioning power. Many hospitals simply fail and services stop, with no place to send their patients. The sick start to die and bodies pile up. Without electricity, gas stations cannot pump gas, streetlights and traffic signals are dark, and those who can make it through the snow soon empty grocery stores of all remaining usable food.\nAt sub-freezing temperatures; humans and their habitats are in peril. As buildings shed their heat, staying warm becomes a challenge. The elderly and the very young succumb first. After the first few days, finding fire for warmth becomes difficult and causes panic. After firewood supplies are consumed, all things paper, and even fine furniture, are burned for warmth. Staying warm in large cities proves particularly challenging. The silent killer of carbon monoxide poisoning leads to accidental deaths.²⁷\nWhen elevators fail to work, having navigated many flights of stairs in the dark to get home, many of those living in apartment buildings stay inside. It takes days for emergency workers to rescue those caught in stalled elevators when the power failed. Fire becomes an unchecked inferno, as desperate city dwellers create fires from anything that will burn. In the absence of vital emergency services, these fires inevitably become uncontrollable. First buildings, then entire neighborhoods, burn out of control.\n²⁷ April Kahn, *What Is Carbon Monoxide Poisoning?*, HEALTHLINE (Dec. 1 2015), http://www.healthline.com/health/carbon-monoxide-poisoning#Overview1.\n244\nN.C. J.L. &amp; TECH.\n[VOL. 18: 233]\nWith transportation halted, after a week or so hunger forces many to go into the cold in search of something to eat.\n## The Midwest in February\nThe weather in Chicago is almost always horrible in February.²⁸ This year is no different. Many resourceful residents in Evanston and the more affluent suburbs use their gas fireplaces for cooking. However, this proves to be much easier to do in theory than in practice. Before long, cooking grease results in fires and dangerous and painful burns. Similar human misery is found throughout the mid-west as cities like Detroit, Cleveland, Columbus and St. Louis quickly stall to a frozen halt.\n## In the South\nThose in warmer climates find survival moderately easier. In rural areas, crops and livestock provide sustenance. Many revert to those survival skills typical of life on the prairie two hundred years earlier. Even worse than the gas lines of the 1970s, service station fuel pumps fail for lack of electrical power, and transportation soon stops as cars are rendered useless due to lack of fuel. Railroad and truck food distribution systems in the South also fail, and the population soon grows hungry. Hunting and fishing moves from being a hobby to a necessity, and survival gains a renewed importance in daily life. Particularly in densely populated areas, household pets soon disappear, along with the residents of many local zoos. Animal shelters everywhere are no longer needed. Easy availability of firearms results in a rapid shift of vital resources between the “haves” and “have nots.”\nAs the homeless have known for years, survival in warmer climates, such as in Florida, is easier during the winter. Unlike the frozen northeast, it is actually possible to sleep outdoors during the winter. As a result, many families in the northern parts of the United States, having abandoned all their belongings, once their\n²⁸ Christian Farr, *Record-Breaking Cold Air Grips Chicago*, NBC CHICAGO 5 (Feb. 19, 2015), http://www.nbcchicago.com/weather/stories/chicago-weather-record-cold-thursday-february-18-292218691.html.\nDEC 2016] Is Cyberattack the Next Pearl Harbor? 245\ngas runs out now find themselves stranded in their cars somewhere between home and their southern destinations.\n## The Importance of Water\nAs those in the western part of the United States have known for years, water scarcity is a life or death issue. Messrs. Papa, Casper, and Moore state that “[s]upervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems and industrial control systems (ICSs) are widely used to control systems such as water supply systems, wastewater collection and treatment facilities... Unfortunately, ... these systems are vulnerable to command injection²⁹ and middle-person attacks.”³⁰\nJames Fugate, now Administrator of the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA),³¹ developed his emergency management skills while serving as Florida’s State Coordinating Officer³² during eleven federal disasters,³³ including the four major hurricanes impacting Florida in 2004,³⁴ and three more in 2005.³⁵ Fugate observes, “[w]e’re not a country that can\n²⁹ See Stephen Papa, William Casper &amp; Tyler Moore, *Securing Wastewater Collection Systems from Accidental and Intentional Harm: A Cost-Benefit Analysis*, 6 INT’L.

Our systems, from water treatment to hospitals to traffic control to all [those] things that we expect every day, our ability to operate without electricity is minimal.”³⁶ The availability of water is a major priority at all times, particularly during a disruptive crisis such as a cyberattack. According to Fugate,\nThat means we need to have enough power to pump, treat, and distribute water through the system. You have to keep the water system up, and you’ve gotta [sic] then focus on the water treatment system. Backing up sewage is just about as bad. Those two pieces will buy you enough time to look at what your alternatives are. Basically, people have to drink water, they have to eat, that waste has to go somewhere, they need medical care, they need a safe environment. There has to be order of law there.³⁷\nThe nation’s water supply presents numerous vulnerabilities. The control system of a small dam within twenty miles of New York City was reported to have been hacked by Iranian hackers in 2013.³⁸ The DOJ unsealed an indictment during March 2016 charging a defendant who was working on behalf of the Iranian Government to hack into the supervisory control and data acquisition systems of the Rye, New York Bowman Dam, thereby providing the ability to control flow rates and water levels.³⁹\n³⁶ See KOPPEL, supra note 6, at 117.\n³⁷ See id. at 118.\n³⁸ See Danny Yadron, Iranian Hacking Threat Emerges, WALL ST.

After the relatively few commercial and home generators run out of their fuel sources, batteries for personal computers, iPads, iPhones, and all other hand-held devices soon lack connectivity and the ability to gain battery recharge. While public broadcasting facilities tend to have backup generators, cable television likely does not operate in most homes due to the lack of household electrical power.

On December 6 through 7, U.S. code breakers intercepted a 14-part message, the so-called ‘War Warning,’ which ended with orders to break off any further talks with the Americans at precisely 1:00 p.m. Washington time (7:30 a.m. Hawaii time) on December 7.⁵⁵\nAmerican code-breaker and mathematics teacher Frank Rowlett observes, “As I look back at all the messages and other information available to us . . . it becomes crystal clear to me that this message ordering the destruction of certain of Washington’s codes provided the necessary evidence . . . which would make war between the United States and Japan a certainty.”⁵⁶ Pearl Harbor had not been protected. As Kahn writes, “Japan had sealed all possible leaks. The ambassadors in Washington were not told of the attacks. Knowledge of it was limited in Toyko to as tight a circle as possible . . .

Tactical information victories, such as the information skirmishes that preceded the Battle of Midway, highlighted the increasing interaction of advanced communications technologies with strategic deception tactics for operational advantage.”⁶⁷ As Professor Chris Bronk observes, “[h]ow states behave with regard to the Internet appears to matter more and more within international affairs . . . [and] Internet conflict may be a new area of international behavior falling somewhere between diplomacy and military action.”⁶⁸\nWhile a detailed discussion of the law of cyberwar is beyond the scope of this paper, any threshold inquiry must start with the question, “What exactly constitutes ‘warfare?’” According to Nineteenth century military theorist Carl von Clausewitz, an act of war requires that aggressive or defensive conduct be (1) “violent or potentially violent, (2) “instrumental: [where] physical violence or the threat of force is a means to compel the enemy to accept the attacker’s will,” and (3) “attributable to one side at some point\n⁶⁴ MICHAEL MCCAUL, FAILURES OF IMAGINATION: THE DEADLIEST THREATS TO OUR HOMELAND—AND HOW TO THWART THEM 5 (New York: Crown Forum 2016).\n⁶⁵ GEORGE SANTAYANA, THE LIFE OF REASON OR THE PHASES OF PROGRESS 284 (Charles Scribner’s Sons 1905).\n⁶⁶ See JULIE RYAN, LEADING ISSUES IN INFORMATION WARFARE AND SECURITY RESEARCH vii (ACPI, 2015).\n⁶⁷ Id.\n⁶⁸ See Christopher Bronk, Blown to Bits: China’s War in Cyberspace, August-September 2020, 5 STRAT.

Actions online affect actions offline, and vice versa. Thus, far from being separate from conventional war, as Rid [contends], cyberwar is deeply embedded in contemporary military practices.”⁷¹ Moreover, “[c]yberwar, in fact, is part of the evolution of conventional warfare, which itself is linked to broader social and political change . . .”⁷²\nIn addition to causing physical injury or death, violence can refer to mental abuse and different forms of deprivation. The academic discipline of peace studies has for decades advanced the concept of structural violence, such as racism and sexism. In its widest sense, then, violence can be found in almost any coercive situation. And the various attacks and activities associated with cyberwar, from stealing data to disrupting other governments’ computer systems, clearly fall within this broad category.⁷³\nThis debate, carried out in the pages of *Foreign Affairs*,⁷⁴ includes Thomas Rid’s concurrence that cyberspace activities are indeed “an inherent part of conventional warfare . . .

For example,\nIn 2007, U.S. soldiers took smartphone photos of a group of new U.S. Army helicopters parked at a base in Iraq and then uploaded them to the Internet. The helicopters weren't classified and the photos showed no seemingly useful information to the enemy. But the soldiers didn't realize the photos also included \"geotags,\" which revealed where the photographers had been standing. Insurgents then used these geotags to pinpoint and destroy four of the helicopters in a mortar attack. Experts now use this example to warn people to be more careful about what they share when engaged in an important activity.⁸¹\n## Warnings Abound\nDespite the repeated warnings from arguably the best and brightest among us, actual action has proved too little too late. Congress finally passed five major pieces of cybersecurity legislation during December 2014, the first cybersecurity laws enacted in more than a decade.⁸² By the time the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign was underway, and following the late 2015 terrorist strikes in Paris, San Bernardino, and Brussels, national security and cyber vulnerability had become topics of major concern to the American public.⁸³ Dean and law professor Jon M.

Coupled with Internet adoption patterns, we are witnessing a dramatic shift in the size, complexity, and diversity of cyber security attacks.”¹⁰³ Before Congress, Kurose testified that the United States:\nNeeds to continue its investments in game-changing research if our cyber systems are to be trustworthy now and in the future. As you know, every day, we learn about more sophisticated and dangerous attacks. Why is the cyber security challenge so hard? The general answer is that attacks and defenses co-evolve: a system that was secure yesterday might no longer be secure tomorrow. More specific responses to this question include:\n- The technology base of our critical infrastructure systems is frequently updated to improve functionality, availability, and/or performance. New systems introduce new vulnerabilities (unknowable in the lab) that need new defenses when put into practice.\n- The environments in which our computing systems are rapidly developed and deployed, and the functionality that they provide are also not static. With entirely new computing models/platforms, like cloud and mobile computing, come new content and function, which in turn create new opportunities and incentives for attack and disruption.\n- As the automation of complex system interdependencies comes to pervade our critical infrastructure, new kinds of cascading vulnerabilities can be accidentally created and subsequently discovered in these systems, including the electric power grid, automated transportation networks, and robotic medical systems.\n- The sophistication of attackers is increasing as well as their sheer number and the specificity of their targets.\n- As information and systems are increasingly connected, and are increasingly composed of software and hardware\n¹⁰³ *Id.*\nDEC 2016] Is Cyberattack the Next Pearl Harbor?\n263\nproduced by global supply chains, the opportunities for malicious insiders to cause damage increases, and the risks of information leaks multiply.\n- As more systems and data become accessible, information that was once low risk becomes high risk through correlation that was unimaginable only a few years ago.\n- Achieving system trustworthiness is not purely a technology problem. System developers, purchasers, operators and users all have a role to play in system security, and ways to incentivize positive behaviors are required. Security mechanisms that are not convenient will be circumvented; security mechanisms that are difficult to understand will be ignored or misinterpreted. Indeed, cyber security is a multi-dimensional challenge, requiring expertise in computer science, mathematics, economics, behavioral sciences, and education.¹⁰⁴\nIn Congressional testimony given on March 4, 2015, Navy Admiral Michael S. Rogers, commander of the U.S. Cyber Command and director of the National Security Agency, stated:\nEvery conflict in the world today has a cyber dimension ... The most worrisome of these campaigns are state-sponsored, persistent, and worldwide in scope. They are aimed at governments, non-profits, and corporations wherever they might be accruing intellectual capital that the attackers believe could be valuable, whether for re-sale or passage to competing firms and industries ... We see states developing capabilities and attaining accesses for potential hostilities, perhaps with the idea of enhancing deterrence or as a beachhead for future cyber sabotage. Private security researchers over the last year have reported on numerous malware finds in the industrial control systems of energy sector organizations ... We believe potential adversaries might be leaving cyber fingerprints on our critical infrastructure partly to convey a message that\n¹⁰⁴ *Id.*\n264\nN.C.J.L. &amp; TECH.\n[VOL. 18: 233\nour homeland is at risk if tensions ever escalate toward military conflict.¹⁰⁵\nTime and time again, specific warnings have been presented to Congress about what needs to be done by government and private organizations to increase their cybersecurity defenses. Secretary of Defense Ash Carter cautioned, “The same Internet that enables Wikipedia also allows terrorists to learn how to build a bomb. And the same technologies we use to target cruise missiles and jam enemy air defenses can be used against our own forces—and they’re now available to the highest bidder.”¹⁰⁶ Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Navy Admiral James A. Winnefeld, Jr. said, “Today, 96 percent of our most advanced electronic warfare systems are assembled with commercially available components. We only add 4 percent worth of ‘special sauce.’¹⁰⁷ That means adversaries can quickly copy advanced U.S. systems with globally sourced components.”¹⁰⁸ Ash Carter warned that “[w]hether it’s in the cloud, infrared cameras, or the GPS signals that provide navigation for ride-sharing apps, but also for aircraft carriers and our smart bombs—our reliance on technology has led to real vulnerabilities that our adversaries are eager to exploit.”¹⁰⁹\nSecretary of Defense, Ash Carter, explains nation-states, terrorist, and criminal networks are “increasing their cyber operations. Low-cost and global proliferation of malware have lowered barriers to entry and made it easier for smaller malicious actors to strike in cyberspace.

Nearly two decades ago, defense analysis professor John Arquilla describes “the first global cyberwar, where the enemy is invisible, the battles virtual, and the casualties all too real.”¹¹⁵ Arquilla’s fictional day-by-day detailed depiction of a three-week-long cyber assault and its precipitating events remains a great read, and with very few exceptions, is just as contemporary today. In 2012, Mike McConnell, former director of national intelligence during President George W. Bush’s administration, warned, “the United States could not ‘wait for the cyber equivalent of the World Trade Centers.’”¹¹⁶\nThe USA PATRIOT Act¹¹⁷ defines *critical infrastructure* as “systems and assets, physical or virtual, so vital to the United States that the incapacity or destruction of such systems and assets would have a debilitating impact on security, national economic security, national public health and safety, or any combination of those matters.”¹¹⁸ Presidential Decision Directive 63 (or PDD-63)\n---\n¹¹⁴ Siobhan Gorman &amp; Julian E.

Unfortunately, changing forms of internet communication are quickly outpacing laws and technology designed to allow for the lawful intercept of communication content.”¹²⁶\nLaw Professor Peter Swire reports that the Review Group, having full awareness of concerns about the “going dark” controversy, “sharply criticized any attempt to introduce vulnerabilities into commercially available products and services, and found that even temporary vulnerabilities should be authorized only after administration-wide scrutiny.”¹²⁷ Moreover, based on\n¹²³ *Id.*\n¹²⁴ FBI Executives: Director James Comey, FBI, https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/fbi-executives.\n¹²⁵ *Going Dark: Encryption, Tech., and the Balance Between Pub.

Rogers observes:\nI liken our historical moment to the situation that confronted the U.S. early in the Cold War, when it became obvious that the Soviet Union and others could build hydrogen bombs and the superpower competition showed worrying signs of instability. We rapidly learned that we needed a nuclear force that was deployed across the three legs of the triad and underpinned by robust command and control mechanisms, far-reaching intelligence, and policy structures including a declared deterrence posture. Building these nuclear forces and the policy and support structures around them took time and did not cause a nuclear war or make the world less safe. On the contrary, it made deterrence predictable, helped to lower tensions, and ultimately facilitated arms control negotiations.

Just as we fashioned a formidable nuclear capability that served us through the Cold War and beyond, I am confident in our ability to keep pace with adversaries who are determined to control “their” corners of cyberspace, to exfiltrate our intellectual property, and to disrupt the functioning of our institutions. They are every bit as determined, creative, and persistent in these efforts as the Soviet leaders we contained during the Cold War, and unfortunately we see few hints they will act more responsibly in cyberspace. Thus we must commit to the long-term goal of building a truly open, secure cyberspace governed collaboratively by many stakeholders, while we remain prepared for crises and contingencies that can arise along the way—just as we do in every other domain.¹⁸³\nBy the end of 2015, Harvard’s Jessica Stein observes, “[l]ooking forward, cyberterrorism and cyberwar will likely pose a more serious threat to Americans’ well-being than conventional terrorist violence, and government surveillance is and will remain an essential weapon against cyberattacks.”¹⁸⁴\nDuring early 2016, President Barack Obama, while announcing his new cyber budget provisions and cybersecurity initiatives, stated:\nMy budget includes more than $19 billion for cybersecurity, which is up by more than one-third. And with this plan, we intend to modernize federal IT by replacing and retiring outdated systems that are vulnerable to attack... one of the biggest gaps between the public\n¹⁸³ Cyber Operations: Improving the Military Cyber Security Posture in an Uncertain Threat Environment: Hearing Before the Subcomm. on Emerging Threats and Capabilities of the H.

[while] the issues faced today are largely reflected in, or are exactly the same as, those faced by the previous generation.”¹⁸⁶ Today, recruiting skilled talent to defend against cyber attack remains a challenge.¹⁸⁷ However, as Mr. Healey observes about cyber defenders,\nAs each new wave of entrants, every five years or so, feels that they are the pioneers. Since they are not taught any history of their field, many accordingly fail to distinguish between what is actually new versus what is just new to them. In addition, cyberspace not only has many characteristics which are non-intuitive to (older) policymakers, but it seems to be forever changing... Admittedly, the field is still emerging rapidly, and we are at the beginning of the ‘cyber age.’ But that is no reason to ignore the useful lessons of its current history.¹⁸⁸\n---\n¹⁸⁵ *Remarks by the President Obama on New Cybersecurity Initiatives* (Feb. 9, 2016), https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/02/09/remarks-president-new-cybersecurity-initiatives (last viewed Apr. 13, 2016); see also *President Obama, Protecting U.S. Innovation from Cyberthreats*, WALL ST.

J.L. &amp; TECH.\n[VOL. 18: 233]\nFor perspective and insight as to vulnerability causation, let us now harken back almost seventy years to findings from the Joint Committee on the Investigation of the Pearl Harbor Attack as they point to “supervisory, administrative, and organizational deficiencies which existed in our Military and Naval establishments in the days before Pearl Harbor.”¹⁸⁹ After careful consideration of evidence produced during its investigation, the Joint Committee produced a series of principles “for the reason that, by their self-evident simplicity, it is difficult to believe they were ignored. . . . [And] in the earnest hope that something constructive may be accomplished that will aid our national defense and preclude a repetition of the disaster of December 7, 1941.”¹⁹⁰ As our strategy evolves to detect, mitigate, and fight cyberattacks, reflection upon these principles, and how, if at all, they may differ in today’s rapidly changing technological environment, may prove helpful. The principles are as follows:\n1. Operational and intelligence work requires centralization of authority and clear-cut allocation of responsibility.\n2. Supervisory officials cannot safely take anything for granted in the alerting of subordinates.\n3. Any doubt as to whether outposts should be given information should always be resolved in favor of supplying the information.\n4. The delegation of authority or the issuance of orders entails the duty of inspection to determine that the official mandate is properly exercised.\n5. The implementation of official orders must be followed with closest supervision.\n6. The maintenance of alertness to responsibility must be insured through repetition.\n---\n¹⁸⁹ S. Rep.

Complacency and procrastination are out of place where sudden and decisive action are of the essence.\n8. The coordination and proper evaluation of intelligence in times of stress must be insured by continuity of service and centralization of responsibility in competent officials.\n9. The unapproachable or superior attitude of officials is fatal. There should never be any hesitancy in asking for clarification of instructions or in seeking advice on matters that are in doubt.\n10. There is no substitute for imagination and resourcefulness on the part of supervisory and intelligence officials.\n11. Communications must be characterized by clarity, forthrightness, and appropriateness.\n12. There is great danger in careless paraphrase of information received and every effort should be made to insure that the paraphrased material reflects the true meaning of the original.\n13. Procedures must be sufficiently flexible to meet the exigencies of unusual situations.\n14. Restrictions of highly confidential information to a minimum number of officials, while often necessary, should not be carried to the point of prejudicing the work of the organization.\n15. There is great danger of being blinded by the self-evident.\n16. Officials should at all times give subordinates the benefit of significant information.\n17. An official who neglects to familiarize himself in detail with his organization should forfeit his responsibility.\n18. Failure can be avoided in the long run only by preparation for any eventuality.\n19. Officials, on a personal basis, should never countermand an official instruction.\n288\nN.C. J.L. &amp; TECH.\n[VOL. 18: 233]\n20. Personal or official jealousy will wreck any organization.\n21. Personal friendship, without more, should never be accepted in lieu of liaison or confused therewith where the latter is necessary to the proper functioning of two or more agencies.\n22. No considerations should be permitted as an excuse for failure to perform a fundamental task.\n23. Superiors must at all times keep their subordinates adequately informed and, conversely, subordinates should keep their superiors informed.\n24. The administrative organization of any establishment must be designed to locate failures and to assess responsibility.\n25. In a well-balanced organization there is close correlation of responsibility and authority.¹⁹¹\nA major difference between the environment surrounding Pearl Harbor and the cyber domain, according to Harvard National Security Fellow Steven Anderson, “is the fact that the military owns less than 15% of the cyberspace environment . . . so integration between the military/public/private sectors is absolutely critical if the nation is going to prevent an event as depicted earlier in this paper . . . let alone how to respond if/when it does occur.”¹⁹²\n## VII.

Enemies have probed and fully mapped the data systems of America’s important corporations and institutions. The future of the United States, represented by its intellectual property, has systematically been stolen by its adversaries. Initial sounding of the alarm, “the hackers are coming; the hackers are coming” may have already faded from deaf ears. However, beware, the hackers are here!

James R. Clapper\nDirector of National Intelligence\nFebruary 26, 2015\n## I. OVERVIEW\nCentral Intelligence Agency Director, Leon Panetta, stated in his Secretary of Defense confirmation testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee that, “the next Pearl Harbor that we confront could very well be a cyberattack that cripples America’s electrical grid and its security and financial systems.” Cyberattacks have become a daily threat to businesses, consumers, and all nation states, resulting in the profound loss of economic assets and intellectual property.

Second, for historical perspective, the December 7, 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor is presented. Third is a review of contemporary and credible warnings. Fourth is a discussion about the privacy versus national security debate, and geopolitical developments that might determine how a cyber drama is played-out on the world stage. Fifth, the question of what is to be done is addressed. Next, the 1946 Congressional Joint Committee on the Investigation of the Pearl Harbor Attack’s recommended principles (designed to prevent the repetition of such a future attack) is reviewed with our contemporary environment in mind.\n## II.

It’s a Tuesday morning in February. Without fanfare or warning, Americans awake to find that nothing works. In Wellesley, Massachusetts, sixth graders at Horatio H. Hunnewell Elementary School on Cameron Street awoke later than usual because alarm clocks failed to provide their normal wake-up call. Meanwhile, just a few miles away in South Boston, the fire fighters of Engine Company 39, Ladder 18 receive delayed notice of homes ablaze because the phone system is down. First responders arrive at their destinations later than normal because traffic lights are not functioning. Everywhere this morning, fire fighters are busy dealing with fires, hamstrung because fire hydrants are not operational due to electrical outages that cause pumps to fail. Those individuals reliant on electrical medical devices are struggling, and confusion is widespread.\nThis Tuesday morning, the electrical grids in the eastern and western United States fail. As a result, all states except for Texas, Alaska and Hawaii (which have their own grids) are without power. The government declares a state of emergency and promises to locate the problem and restore services as soon as possible. Emergency generators provide power for some essential services such as hospitals and public broadcasters. However, schools are closed, and public transportation proves intermittent at best. Inoperable traffic signals cause automobile travel to slow to a snail’s pace in major cities. Phone landlines are down for most businesses. Cell towers don’t work because of power loss. Some people use this “holiday” from work and school to venture out for necessities. However, stocked groceries and operating gas stations prove hard to come by since few sources have their own power generators. Most restaurants are unable to open due to lack of electricity and public transportation for their employees. With memories of 9/11 and the use of air transportation for purposes of\n See generally TED KOPPEL, LIGHTS OUT: A CYBERATTACK; A NATION UNPREPARED; SURVIVING THE AFTERMATH (Crown Pub., 2015) (depicting a future attack on U.S. power grids and its aftermath).

All originating air travel is cancelled, resulting in the stranding of travelers numbering in the tens of thousands, usually at unfamiliar airports. Even so, just before all aircraft could land, reports of compromised aircraft control systems are reported. Also, within recent memory are the terrorist attacks at Fort Hood, the Boston Marathon, Paris, San Bernardino, and Brussels.\n See generally Derek Jinks, September 11 and the Laws of War, 28 YALE J.

But this morning, no spinach &amp; feta omelets are served. Like Florida, southern Texas and Arizona, the West Coast—particularly southern California—benefits from a climate that is hospitable even during February. At the macro level, widespread losses of electrical power result in store closures and quicker defrost and spoilage of existing grocery store foodstuffs. The inability to pump gas at most service stations quickly results in long lines of cars waiting to fuel at the few open gas stations (before resupply trucks fail to make deliveries). Abandoned cars left on streets and highways soon become a major problem for the already congested Los Angeles area.\nIn northern California, Sandhill Road in Menlo Park, just a few minutes from Stanford University, is “ground zero” for America’s venture capital industry. This morning, many pillars of venture finance find themselves locked out of their offices when front door electronic security devices fail to operate. Classes are cancelled at Stanford, and lunch will not be served today along Fisherman’s Wharf in San Francisco.\nEven during February, the impact of global warming and wildfires prove to be problematic this year in the western United States. Lack of transportation hinders both first responder emergency services, such as firefighting efforts, and the ability to move agricultural products to heavily populated areas. Widespread\nZeckhauser, *Recollection Bias and Its Underpinnings: Lessons from Terrorism-Risk Assessments* (Harvard Kennedy Sch., Working Paper No. 16-003) (2015), http://ssrn.com/abstract=2692253.\n\n[VOL. 18: 233\nhunger soon becomes the primary cause of civil unrest and crime. Frightened people quickly resort to desperate measures.\nFor California, as in most of the United States, most component parts of the electrical grid are now many decades old. Critically important for transferring electrical power between circuits, large power transformers average forty years old, with many in operation for an excess of seventy years. After power failures from disasters such as Hurricane Sandy on the U.S. east coast, the grid’s “reliability, effectiveness, and affordability are increasingly being brought into question.” However, not enough was done to fix the grid.\n## National Capital Area\nThis morning, breakfast is not available at the Hay Adams Hotel across from the White House. Nor were the doors open for business at Busboys and Poets at 2021 14th Street, NW. All the typical tourist attractions like the Smithsonian Museums remain closed, along with public schools. Classes are cancelled at American, Catholic, Georgetown, George Washington, Howard, and the University of the District of Columbia.\nThe bureaucratic army of the Potomac is estimated to employ over 500,000 federal workers, not counting the thousands of lawyers and consultants that perform work primarily for the U.S. government. Almost all remain at home this day. As any thoughtful cyber warfare strategist might have predicted, an attack on the metropolitan Washington, DC – Baltimore metroplex is a focal point of the hostilities. Primary targets were the cyber warriors located at the suburban Washington, DC headquarters of\n Brian Warshay, *Upgrading the Grid: How to Modernize America’s Electrical Infrastructure*, FOREIGN AFF., Mar.–Apr. 2015, at 125.\n *Id.*\n *BUSBOYS AND POETS*, http://www.busboysandpoets.com/ (last visited Nov. 17, 2016).\n See *Federal Employees By State*, GOVERNING.COM, http://www.governing.com/gov-data/federal-employees-workforce-numbers-by-state.html (reporting data on the concentration of federal employees compiled from 2013 Bureau of Labor Statistics Current Employment Statistics).\nDEC 2016] · Is Cyberattack the Next Pearl Harbor? 241\nthe National Security Agency (NSA), the Northern Virginia defense community represented by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and the almost 30,000 employees who work at the Pentagon. In addition to these well-known agencies are the many whom the press seldom acknowledges as they engage in the mission of defending the United States against attacks both physical and virtual.\n## Day Three: Internet Backbone and Fiber Cable Destroyed\nBecause most had not enjoyed Internet availability since Zero Day due to lack of power, the sabotage and loss of the undersea international fiber cable system a few days after the initial attack on the U.S. power grid remained generally unnoticed. This submarine fiber optic network is “the physical infrastructure that underpins the virtual cloud of cyberspace.” Since its advent in 1977, the fiber optic cable system has experienced rampant growth. Thomas Friedman observes, “around the year 2000 we entered a whole new era, Globalization 3.0 . . . [which brings] the newfound power for individuals to collaborate and compete globally.” Friedman contends this development allows rapid circulation of digital content at almost no cost, thus creating global collaboration. Therefore, “[g]lobalization 3.0 is going to be more and more driven not only by individuals but also by a much more diverse—non-western, non white—group of individuals. Individuals from every corner of the flat world are being empowered.”\n---\n *Contact Us*, NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY, https://www.nsa.gov/about/contact-us/ (last visited Nov. 17, 2016).\n *Contact CIA*, CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY, https://www.cia.gov/index.html# (last visited Nov. 17, 2016).\n Barbara Maranzani, 9 *Things You May Not Know About the Pentagon*, HISTORY.COM (Jan. 15, 2013), http://www.history.com/news/9-things-you-may-not-know-about-the-pentagon.\n Tara Davenport, *Submarine Cables, Cybersecurity and International Law: An Intersectional Analysis*, 24 CATH.

Almost overnight, money has no meaning; bartering replaces currency for transactions, and the American economy grinds to a halt. Banks are closed, and ATM machines fail to operate.\nDown on Wall Street, although emergency backup systems are capable of trading securities, orders to buy or sell are not received in New York, as Boston area brokerage offices lack telephone service and have no ability to communicate. Commerce ceases nationwide as the power grid continues to stay down. Backup systems powered by fossil fuels soon deplete their supplies of coal, gas, diesel, kerosene, *et cetera*. Much like the great blizzard of 2015, snow is piled up everywhere. Schools have not reopened since Zero Day. Public transportation remains closed. After several days, snow removal is finally abandoned for lack of fuel and because workers choose to be at home with their families.\n Davenport, *supra* note 20, at 62 (citing G.A. Res. 65/37, ¶ 121 (Dec. 7, 2010)).\n Davenport, *supra* note 20, at 62 (citing LIONEL CARTER ET AL., SUBMARINE CABLES AND THE OCEANS: CONNECTING THE WORLD 8 (2009), http://www.iscpc.org/publications/ICPC-UNEP_Report.pdf).\n Davenport, *supra* note 20, at 63.\n Alex Sosnowski, *How Did East Coast Blizzard of 2015 Play Out?*, ACCUWEATHER (Jan. 31, 2015), http://www.accuweather.com/en/weather-news/what-happened-to-the-forecast/41294989.\nDEC 2016] Is Cyberattack the Next Pearl Harbor? 243\nAmbulance, fire, and police services quickly become missing in action. But this time, things are different.\nIt’s been almost ten days now since electricity went out across forty-seven states. For a while, hospitals are okay with their backup power sources. Within a week or so, many start to run out of fuel to power their generators. At first, elective surgeries are postponed. Several days later as power becomes increasingly scarce, medical monitoring machines fail and lab testing stops. Doctors, nurses, and other healthcare workers cannot make their way between home and work. By now, most hospitals are desperately understaffed, without fuel or other sources of functioning power. Many hospitals simply fail and services stop, with no place to send their patients. The sick start to die and bodies pile up. Without electricity, gas stations cannot pump gas, streetlights and traffic signals are dark, and those who can make it through the snow soon empty grocery stores of all remaining usable food.\nAt sub-freezing temperatures; humans and their habitats are in peril. As buildings shed their heat, staying warm becomes a challenge. The elderly and the very young succumb first. After the first few days, finding fire for warmth becomes difficult and causes panic. After firewood supplies are consumed, all things paper, and even fine furniture, are burned for warmth. Staying warm in large cities proves particularly challenging. The silent killer of carbon monoxide poisoning leads to accidental deaths.\nWhen elevators fail to work, having navigated many flights of stairs in the dark to get home, many of those living in apartment buildings stay inside. It takes days for emergency workers to rescue those caught in stalled elevators when the power failed. Fire becomes an unchecked inferno, as desperate city dwellers create fires from anything that will burn. In the absence of vital emergency services, these fires inevitably become uncontrollable. First buildings, then entire neighborhoods, burn out of control.\n April Kahn, *What Is Carbon Monoxide Poisoning?*, HEALTHLINE (Dec. 1 2015), http://www.healthline.com/health/carbon-monoxide-poisoning#Overview1.\n\n[VOL. 18: 233]\nWith transportation halted, after a week or so hunger forces many to go into the cold in search of something to eat.\n## The Midwest in February\nThe weather in Chicago is almost always horrible in February. This year is no different. Many resourceful residents in Evanston and the more affluent suburbs use their gas fireplaces for cooking. However, this proves to be much easier to do in theory than in practice. Before long, cooking grease results in fires and dangerous and painful burns. Similar human misery is found throughout the mid-west as cities like Detroit, Cleveland, Columbus and St. Louis quickly stall to a frozen halt.\n## In the South\nThose in warmer climates find survival moderately easier. In rural areas, crops and livestock provide sustenance. Many revert to those survival skills typical of life on the prairie two hundred years earlier. Even worse than the gas lines of the 1970s, service station fuel pumps fail for lack of electrical power, and transportation soon stops as cars are rendered useless due to lack of fuel. Railroad and truck food distribution systems in the South also fail, and the population soon grows hungry. Hunting and fishing moves from being a hobby to a necessity, and survival gains a renewed importance in daily life. Particularly in densely populated areas, household pets soon disappear, along with the residents of many local zoos. Animal shelters everywhere are no longer needed. Easy availability of firearms results in a rapid shift of vital resources between the “haves” and “have nots.”\nAs the homeless have known for years, survival in warmer climates, such as in Florida, is easier during the winter. Unlike the frozen northeast, it is actually possible to sleep outdoors during the winter.

Messrs. Papa, Casper, and Moore state that “[s]upervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems and industrial control systems (ICSs) are widely used to control systems such as water supply systems, wastewater collection and treatment facilities... Unfortunately, ... these systems are vulnerable to command injection and middle-person attacks.”\nJames Fugate, now Administrator of the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), developed his emergency management skills while serving as Florida’s State Coordinating Officer during eleven federal disasters, including the four major hurricanes impacting Florida in 2004, and three more in 2005.

Our systems, from water treatment to hospitals to traffic control to all [those] things that we expect every day, our ability to operate without electricity is minimal.” The availability of water is a major priority at all times, particularly during a disruptive crisis such as a cyberattack. According to Fugate,\nThat means we need to have enough power to pump, treat, and distribute water through the system. You have to keep the water system up, and you’ve gotta [sic] then focus on the water treatment system. Backing up sewage is just about as bad. Those two pieces will buy you enough time to look at what your alternatives are. Basically, people have to drink water, they have to eat, that waste has to go somewhere, they need medical care, they need a safe environment. There has to be order of law there.\nThe nation’s water supply presents numerous vulnerabilities. The control system of a small dam within twenty miles of New York City was reported to have been hacked by Iranian hackers in 2013. The DOJ unsealed an indictment during March 2016 charging a defendant who was working on behalf of the Iranian Government to hack into the supervisory control and data acquisition systems of the Rye, New York Bowman Dam, thereby providing the ability to control flow rates and water levels.\n See KOPPEL, supra note 6, at 117.\n See id. at 118.\n See Danny Yadron, Iranian Hacking Threat Emerges, WALL ST.

After the relatively few commercial and home generators run out of their fuel sources, batteries for personal computers, iPads, iPhones, and all other hand-held devices soon lack connectivity and the ability to gain battery recharge. While public broadcasting facilities tend to have backup generators, cable television likely does not operate in most homes due to the lack of household electrical power.

As a result, “[e]ighteen ships of the American Pacific Fleet were sunk or badly damaged, including eight battleships.” “One hundred and eighty-eight aircraft were destroyed (mostly on the ground) and 2,403 people were killed.” The United States declared war on Japan the next day and entered World War II.\n## Value of Code-breaking\nOf particular relevance to this discussion is the evidence suggesting that better and quicker communication between various elements of the U.S. intelligence apparatus could have saved lives by providing warning of the impending attack. In 1937, building on the work of great American cryptanalysts such as Herbert O. Yardley, Laurance F. Safford, Agnes Meyer Driscoll, William F. Friedman, Frank B. Rowlett, Genevieve Grotjan, and many others, relevant “solutions of intercepted foreign messages began flowing to the White House.”\nPeter Kross writes that “[i]n 1941, William Friedman had broken the Japanese cryptosystem called Purple, which allowed this country to read all the diplomatic traffic coming from Tokyo to its outposts around the world.” David Kahn writes that “[b]y late 1941 solutions . . . soared to 50 to 75 messages a day . . .

Tokyo to the ambassador in Washington declared: There is more reason than ever before for us to arm ourselves to the teeth for all-out war.” Moreover,\nIn the first week of December, 1941, the U.S. learned that the Japanese government gave instructions to its Washington embassy to start destroying its codes, a clear sign that diplomatic relations were about to be broken. On December 6 through 7, U.S. code breakers intercepted a 14-part message, the so-called ‘War Warning,’ which ended with orders to break off any further talks with the Americans at precisely 1:00 p.m. Washington time (7:30 a.m. Hawaii time) on December 7.\nAmerican code-breaker and mathematics teacher Frank Rowlett observes, “As I look back at all the messages and other information available to us . . . it becomes crystal clear to me that this message ordering the destruction of certain of Washington’s codes provided the necessary evidence . . . which would make war between the United States and Japan a certainty.” Pearl Harbor had not been protected. As Kahn writes, “Japan had sealed all possible leaks. The ambassadors in Washington were not told of the attacks. Knowledge of it was limited in Toyko to as tight a circle as possible . . . No reference to a raid on Pearl Harbor ever went on the air, even coded.” In a tragedy of errors, “[d]isorganization and divided responsibility had cost America dearly.” It had taken fifteen and a half hours after message No.\n See Kahn, supra note 52.\n KROSS, supra note 53, at 269.; see also FRED B.

Seven prior investigations concerning the Pearl Harbor attack produced “9,754 printed pages of testimony from 318 witnesses and the attendant 469 exhibits.” The work of the Joint Committee itself resulted in the taking of some 15,000 pages of testimony “and a total of 183 exhibits received incident to an examination of 43 witnesses.” The report asks why “with the almost certain knowledge that war was at hand, with plans that contemplated the precise type of attack that was executed by Japan on the morning of December 7—[w]hy was it possible for Pearl Harbor to occur?”\n## Lessons from History\nThe surprise attack on Pearl Harbor is not an event anyone under the age of seventy-five will remember from actual life experiences. Therefore, the knowledge most U.S. citizens have about Pearl Harbor comes from history books and may seem increasingly remote as the years pass. For many families, the oral histories passed down by parents and grandparents are how many contemporary Americans remember and learn about Pearl Harbor.

Tactical information victories, such as the information skirmishes that preceded the Battle of Midway, highlighted the increasing interaction of advanced communications technologies with strategic deception tactics for operational advantage.” As Professor Chris Bronk observes, “[h]ow states behave with regard to the Internet appears to matter more and more within international affairs . . . [and] Internet conflict may be a new area of international behavior falling somewhere between diplomacy and military action.”\nWhile a detailed discussion of the law of cyberwar is beyond the scope of this paper, any threshold inquiry must start with the question, “What exactly constitutes ‘warfare?’” According to Nineteenth century military theorist Carl von Clausewitz, an act of war requires that aggressive or defensive conduct be (1) “violent or potentially violent, (2) “instrumental: [where] physical violence or the threat of force is a means to compel the enemy to accept the attacker’s will,” and (3) “attributable to one side at some point\n MICHAEL MCCAUL, FAILURES OF IMAGINATION: THE DEADLIEST THREATS TO OUR HOMELAND—AND HOW TO THWART THEM 5 (New York: Crown Forum 2016).\n GEORGE SANTAYANA, THE LIFE OF REASON OR THE PHASES OF PROGRESS 284 (Charles Scribner’s Sons 1905).\n See JULIE RYAN, LEADING ISSUES IN INFORMATION WARFARE AND SECURITY RESEARCH vii (ACPI, 2015).\n Id.\n See Christopher Bronk, Blown to Bits: China’s War in Cyberspace, August-September 2020, 5 STRAT.

Actions online affect actions offline, and vice versa. Thus, far from being separate from conventional war, as Rid [contends], cyberwar is deeply embedded in contemporary military practices.” Moreover, “[c]yberwar, in fact, is part of the evolution of conventional warfare, which itself is linked to broader social and political change . . .”\nIn addition to causing physical injury or death, violence can refer to mental abuse and different forms of deprivation. The academic discipline of peace studies has for decades advanced the concept of structural violence, such as racism and sexism. In its widest sense, then, violence can be found in almost any coercive situation. And the various attacks and activities associated with cyberwar, from stealing data to disrupting other governments’ computer systems, clearly fall within this broad category.\nThis debate, carried out in the pages of *Foreign Affairs*, includes Thomas Rid’s concurrence that cyberspace activities are indeed “an inherent part of conventional warfare . . .

CONTEMPORARY WARNINGS IGNORED\n“Knowing what we know now, there will be no explaining our inaction after the next attack.”\nGen. Michael V. Hayden\nFormer Director of the National Security Agency and CIA76\nSinger and Friedman believe that “[d]efining cyberwar need not be so complicated. The key elements of war in cyberspace all have their parallels and connections to warfare in other domains . . . war always has a political goal and mode (which distinguishes it from crime) and always has an element of violence.”77 For example, “the US government’s position is that to meet this definition of the use of force, a cyberattack would have to ‘proximately result in death, injury or significant destruction.’ That is, even if conducted through cyber means, the effect must be physical damage or destruction.”78\nHouse Homeland Security Chairman Michael McCaul reflected on the 9/11 Commission’s “lack of readiness;” finding, where\n\n[VOL: 18: 233\n\"[t]he most important failure was one of imagination.\" For those age thirty-five or younger, it may be hard to recognize that widespread availability of the Internet dates back only to the 1990s in the United States.

The helicopters weren't classified and the photos showed no seemingly useful information to the enemy.

Insurgents then used these geotags to pinpoint and destroy four of the helicopters in a mortar attack. Experts now use this example to warn people to be more careful about what they share when engaged in an important activity.\n## Warnings Abound\nDespite the repeated warnings from arguably the best and brightest among us, actual action has proved too little too late. Congress finally passed five major pieces of cybersecurity legislation during December 2014, the first cybersecurity laws enacted in more than a decade. By the time the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign was underway, and following the late 2015 terrorist strikes in Paris, San Bernardino, and Brussels, national security and cyber vulnerability had become topics of major concern to the American public.

Perhaps the most tangible effect of this terrorist activity is the momentum it provided to enact the Cybersecurity Act of 2015.”85 Observing that “[t]he omnibus $1.1 trillion spending law also includes hundreds of millions of dollars to add cybersecurity for the IRS, EPA, and other agencies,” Dean Garon warns, “[t]he law provides little more than a fig leaf for privacy protection, so only the development of final implementing regulations will determine whether there are meaningful safeguards from the potential abuse of the data sharing provisions to intrude on individual privacy.”86\nGeneral Michael V. Hayden, former director of both the National Security Agency (“NSA”) and Central Intelligence Agency (“CIA”) warned during 2011 that\n[o]ur most pressing need is clear policy, formed by shared consensus, shaped by informed discussion, and created by a common body of knowledge. With no common knowledge, no meaningful discussion, and no consensus ... the policy vacuum continues. This will not be easy ... it will require courage; but, it is essential and should itself be the subject of intense discussion.87\nCommander of U.S. Cyber Command and National Security Agency (“NSA”) Admiral Mike Rogers characterized “cyber attacks as the greatest long-term threat to national security in part\n\nDEC 2016] Is Cyberattack the Next Pearl Harbor? 259\nbecause ‘we have yet to come to a broad policy and legal consensus.’”\nAlso during 2011, Deputy Secretary of Defense William Lynn stated, “If we can minimize the impact of attacks on our operations and attribute them quickly and definitively, we may be able to change the decision calculus of an attacker.” According to the Pentagon, the volume of intellectual property stolen annually exceeds the amount of information contained in the Library of Congress.\nDuring April 2012, subcommittees of the U.S. House Committee on Homeland Security held hearings on the topic of “Iranian Cyber Threat to the U.S. Homeland.” On August 8, 2012, John O.

Johnson cautioned that in their daily lives, Americans are finding that “cyberspace is vulnerable to an ever-evolving range of threats.” Secretary Johnson further observes that this vulnerability stems “from criminals to nation-state actors, ranging in purpose from identity and data theft to espionage and disruption of critical functions. As our Nation’s reliance on cyber networks has grown, incidents which impact the safety and confidence with which we operate online have become increasingly commonplace.”\nBy early 2015, James F.

Coupled with Internet adoption patterns, we are witnessing a dramatic shift in the size, complexity, and diversity of cyber security attacks.” Before Congress, Kurose testified that the United States:\nNeeds to continue its investments in game-changing research if our cyber systems are to be trustworthy now and in the future. As you know, every day, we learn about more sophisticated and dangerous attacks. Why is the cyber security challenge so hard? The general answer is that attacks and defenses co-evolve: a system that was secure yesterday might no longer be secure tomorrow. More specific responses to this question include:\n- The technology base of our critical infrastructure systems is frequently updated to improve functionality, availability, and/or performance. New systems introduce new vulnerabilities (unknowable in the lab) that need new defenses when put into practice.\n- The environments in which our computing systems are rapidly developed and deployed, and the functionality that they provide are also not static. With entirely new computing models/platforms, like cloud and mobile computing, come new content and function, which in turn create new opportunities and incentives for attack and disruption.\n- As the automation of complex system interdependencies comes to pervade our critical infrastructure, new kinds of cascading vulnerabilities can be accidentally created and subsequently discovered in these systems, including the electric power grid, automated transportation networks, and robotic medical systems.\n- The sophistication of attackers is increasing as well as their sheer number and the specificity of their targets.\n- As information and systems are increasingly connected, and are increasingly composed of software and hardware\n *Id.*\nDEC 2016] Is Cyberattack the Next Pearl Harbor?\n\n- As more systems and data become accessible, information that was once low risk becomes high risk through correlation that was unimaginable only a few years ago.\n- Achieving system trustworthiness is not purely a technology problem. System developers, purchasers, operators and users all have a role to play in system security, and ways to incentivize positive behaviors are required. Security mechanisms that are not convenient will be circumvented; security mechanisms that are difficult to understand will be ignored or misinterpreted. Indeed, cyber security is a multi-dimensional challenge, requiring expertise in computer science, mathematics, economics, behavioral sciences, and education.\nIn Congressional testimony given on March 4, 2015, Navy Admiral Michael S. Rogers, commander of the U.S. Cyber Command and director of the National Security Agency, stated:\nEvery conflict in the world today has a cyber dimension ... The most worrisome of these campaigns are state-sponsored, persistent, and worldwide in scope. They are aimed at governments, non-profits, and corporations wherever they might be accruing intellectual capital that the attackers believe could be valuable, whether for re-sale or passage to competing firms and industries ... We see states developing capabilities and attaining accesses for potential hostilities, perhaps with the idea of enhancing deterrence or as a beachhead for future cyber sabotage. Private security researchers over the last year have reported on numerous malware finds in the industrial control systems of energy sector organizations ... We believe potential adversaries might be leaving cyber fingerprints on our critical infrastructure partly to convey a message that\n *Id.*\n\n[VOL. 18: 233\nour homeland is at risk if tensions ever escalate toward military conflict.\nTime and time again, specific warnings have been presented to Congress about what needs to be done by government and private organizations to increase their cybersecurity defenses. Secretary of Defense Ash Carter cautioned, “The same Internet that enables Wikipedia also allows terrorists to learn how to build a bomb. And the same technologies we use to target cruise missiles and jam enemy air defenses can be used against our own forces—and they’re now available to the highest bidder.” Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Navy Admiral James A. Winnefeld, Jr. said, “Today, 96 percent of our most advanced electronic warfare systems are assembled with commercially available components. We only add 4 percent worth of ‘special sauce.’ That means adversaries can quickly copy advanced U.S. systems with globally sourced components.” Ash Carter warned that “[w]hether it’s in the cloud, infrared cameras, or the GPS signals that provide navigation for ride-sharing apps, but also for aircraft carriers and our smart bombs—our reliance on technology has led to real vulnerabilities that our adversaries are eager to exploit.”\nSecretary of Defense, Ash Carter, explains nation-states, terrorist, and criminal networks are “increasing their cyber operations. Low-cost and global proliferation of malware have lowered barriers to entry and made it easier for smaller malicious actors to strike in cyberspace.

He stated, “[T]errorist groups operating in-permissive environments present a significant security threat to the U.S. and our allies . . .

Unfortunately, changing forms of internet communication are quickly outpacing laws and technology designed to allow for the lawful intercept of communication content.”\nLaw Professor Peter Swire reports that the Review Group, having full awareness of concerns about the “going dark” controversy, “sharply criticized any attempt to introduce vulnerabilities into commercially available products and services, and found that even temporary vulnerabilities should be authorized only after administration-wide scrutiny.” Moreover, based on\n *Id.*\n FBI Executives: Director James Comey, FBI, https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/fbi-executives.\n *Going Dark: Encryption, Tech., and the Balance Between Pub.

In addition to reducing risks to national security, public officials must consider four other risks:\n---\n Melissa Hathaway, Chris Demchak, Jason Kerben, Jennifer McArdle &amp; Francesca Spidalieri, *Cyber Readiness Index 2.0: A Plan for Cyber Readiness: A Baseline and an Index*, POTOMAC INST.

Rogers observes:\nI liken our historical moment to the situation that confronted the U.S. early in the Cold War, when it became obvious that the Soviet Union and others could build hydrogen bombs and the superpower competition showed worrying signs of instability. We rapidly learned that we needed a nuclear force that was deployed across the three legs of the triad and underpinned by robust command and control mechanisms, far-reaching intelligence, and policy structures including a declared deterrence posture. Building these nuclear forces and the policy and support structures around them took time and did not cause a nuclear war or make the world less safe. On the contrary, it made deterrence predictable, helped to lower tensions, and ultimately facilitated arms control negotiations. While the analogy to cyberspace is not exact, it seems clear that our\n Richard A. Clarke, Michael J. Stone, Cass R.

Just as we fashioned a formidable nuclear capability that served us through the Cold War and beyond, I am confident in our ability to keep pace with adversaries who are determined to control “their” corners of cyberspace, to exfiltrate our intellectual property, and to disrupt the functioning of our institutions. They are every bit as determined, creative, and persistent in these efforts as the Soviet leaders we contained during the Cold War, and unfortunately we see few hints they will act more responsibly in cyberspace. Thus we must commit to the long-term goal of building a truly open, secure cyberspace governed collaboratively by many stakeholders, while we remain prepared for crises and contingencies that can arise along the way—just as we do in every other domain.\nBy the end of 2015, Harvard’s Jessica Stein observes, “[l]ooking forward, cyberterrorism and cyberwar will likely pose a more serious threat to Americans’ well-being than conventional terrorist violence, and government surveillance is and will remain an essential weapon against cyberattacks.”\nDuring early 2016, President Barack Obama, while announcing his new cyber budget provisions and cybersecurity initiatives, stated:\nMy budget includes more than $19 billion for cybersecurity, which is up by more than one-third. And with this plan, we intend to modernize federal IT by replacing and retiring outdated systems that are vulnerable to attack... one of the biggest gaps between the public\n Cyber Operations: Improving the Military Cyber Security Posture in an Uncertain Threat Environment: Hearing Before the Subcomm. on Emerging Threats and Capabilities of the H.

Our Social Security system still runs on a Cobalt platform that dates back to the ‘60s. Our IRS systems are archaic... If we’re going to really secure those in a serious way, then we need to upgrade them . . .\n## More Lessons from History\nJason Healey is a former Director of Cyber Policy during the Obama Administration and cautions that “[c]yber history has been forgotten, ignored as irrelevant, or intentionally falsified . . . [while] the issues faced today are largely reflected in, or are exactly the same as, those faced by the previous generation.” Today, recruiting skilled talent to defend against cyber attack remains a challenge. However, as Mr. Healey observes about cyber defenders,\nAs each new wave of entrants, every five years or so, feels that they are the pioneers. Since they are not taught any history of their field, many accordingly fail to distinguish between what is actually new versus what is just new to them. In addition, cyberspace not only has many characteristics which are non-intuitive to (older) policymakers, but it seems to be forever changing... Admittedly, the field is still emerging rapidly, and we are at the beginning of the ‘cyber age.’ But that is no reason to ignore the useful lessons of its current history.\n---\n *Remarks by the President Obama on New Cybersecurity Initiatives* (Feb. 9, 2016), https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/02/09/remarks-president-new-cybersecurity-initiatives (last viewed Apr. 13, 2016); see also *President Obama, Protecting U.S. Innovation from Cyberthreats*, WALL ST.

[And] in the earnest hope that something constructive may be accomplished that will aid our national defense and preclude a repetition of the disaster of December 7, 1941.” As our strategy evolves to detect, mitigate, and fight cyberattacks, reflection upon these principles, and how, if at all, they may differ in today’s rapidly changing technological environment, may prove helpful. The principles are as follows:\n1. Operational and intelligence work requires centralization of authority and clear-cut allocation of responsibility.\n2. Supervisory officials cannot safely take anything for granted in the alerting of subordinates.\n3. Any doubt as to whether outposts should be given information should always be resolved in favor of supplying the information.\n4. The delegation of authority or the issuance of orders entails the duty of inspection to determine that the official mandate is properly exercised.\n5. The implementation of official orders must be followed with closest supervision.\n6. The maintenance of alertness to responsibility must be insured through repetition.\n---\n S. Rep.

Complacency and procrastination are out of place where sudden and decisive action are of the essence.\n8. The coordination and proper evaluation of intelligence in times of stress must be insured by continuity of service and centralization of responsibility in competent officials.\n9. The unapproachable or superior attitude of officials is fatal. There should never be any hesitancy in asking for clarification of instructions or in seeking advice on matters that are in doubt.\n10. There is no substitute for imagination and resourcefulness on the part of supervisory and intelligence officials.\n11. Communications must be characterized by clarity, forthrightness, and appropriateness.\n12. There is great danger in careless paraphrase of information received and every effort should be made to insure that the paraphrased material reflects the true meaning of the original.\n13. Procedures must be sufficiently flexible to meet the exigencies of unusual situations.\n14. Restrictions of highly confidential information to a minimum number of officials, while often necessary, should not be carried to the point of prejudicing the work of the organization.\n15. There is great danger of being blinded by the self-evident.\n16. Officials should at all times give subordinates the benefit of significant information.\n17. An official who neglects to familiarize himself in detail with his organization should forfeit his responsibility.\n18. Failure can be avoided in the long run only by preparation for any eventuality.\n19. Officials, on a personal basis, should never countermand an official instruction.\n\n[VOL. 18: 233]\n20. Personal or official jealousy will wreck any organization.\n21. Personal friendship, without more, should never be accepted in lieu of liaison or confused therewith where the latter is necessary to the proper functioning of two or more agencies.\n22. No considerations should be permitted as an excuse for failure to perform a fundamental task.\n23. Superiors must at all times keep their subordinates adequately informed and, conversely, subordinates should keep their superiors informed.\n24. The administrative organization of any establishment must be designed to locate failures and to assess responsibility.\n25. In a well-balanced organization there is close correlation of responsibility and authority.\nA major difference between the environment surrounding Pearl Harbor and the cyber domain, according to Harvard National Security Fellow Steven Anderson, “is the fact that the military owns less than 15% of the cyberspace environment . . . so integration between the military/public/private sectors is absolutely critical if the nation is going to prevent an event as depicted earlier in this paper . . . let alone how to respond if/when it does occur.”\n## VII.

Now, just as in the days and weeks immediately preceding the 1941 attack against the United States at Pearl Harbor, all the necessary warning signs are there. Enemies have probed and fully mapped the data systems of America’s important corporations and institutions. The future of the United States, represented by its intellectual property, has systematically been stolen by its adversaries. Initial sounding of the alarm, “the hackers are coming; the hackers are coming” may have already faded from deaf ears. However, beware, the hackers are here!

It’s a Tuesday morning in February. Without fanfare or warning, Americans awake to find that nothing works. In Wellesley, Massachusetts, sixth graders at Horatio H. Hunnewell Elementary School on Cameron Street awoke later than usual because alarm clocks failed to provide their normal wake-up call. Meanwhile, just a few miles away in South Boston, the fire fighters of Engine Company 39, Ladder 18 receive delayed notice of homes ablaze because the phone system is down. First responders arrive at their destinations later than normal because traffic lights are not functioning. Everywhere this morning, fire fighters are busy dealing with fires, hamstrung because fire hydrants are not operational due to electrical outages that cause pumps to fail. Those individuals reliant on electrical medical devices are struggling, and confusion is widespread.\nThis Tuesday morning, the electrical grids in the eastern and western United States fail. As a result, all states except for Texas, Alaska and Hawaii (which have their own grids) are without power. The government declares a state of emergency and promises to locate the problem and restore services as soon as possible. Emergency generators provide power for some essential services such as hospitals and public broadcasters. However, schools are closed, and public transportation proves intermittent at best. Inoperable traffic signals cause automobile travel to slow to a snail’s pace in major cities. Phone landlines are down for most businesses. Cell towers don’t work because of power loss. Some people use this “holiday” from work and school to venture out for necessities. However, stocked groceries and operating gas stations prove hard to come by since few sources have their own power generators. Most restaurants are unable to open due to lack of electricity and public transportation for their employees.

All originating air travel is cancelled, resulting in the stranding of travelers numbering in the tens of thousands, usually at unfamiliar airports. Even so, just before all aircraft could land, reports of compromised aircraft control systems are reported.

But this morning, no spinach &amp; feta omelets are served. Like Florida, southern Texas and Arizona, the West Coast—particularly southern California—benefits from a climate that is hospitable even during February. At the macro level, widespread losses of electrical power result in store closures and quicker defrost and spoilage of existing grocery store foodstuffs. The inability to pump gas at most service stations quickly results in long lines of cars waiting to fuel at the few open gas stations (before resupply trucks fail to make deliveries). Abandoned cars left on streets and highways soon become a major problem for the already congested Los Angeles area.\nIn northern California, Sandhill Road in Menlo Park, just a few minutes from Stanford University, is “ground zero” for America’s venture capital industry. This morning, many pillars of venture finance find themselves locked out of their offices when front door electronic security devices fail to operate. Classes are cancelled at Stanford, and lunch will not be served today along Fisherman’s Wharf in San Francisco.\nEven during February, the impact of global warming and wildfires prove to be problematic this year in the western United States. Lack of transportation hinders both first responder emergency services, such as firefighting efforts, and the ability to move agricultural products to heavily populated areas.

Frightened people quickly resort to desperate measures.\nFor California, as in most of the United States, most component parts of the electrical grid are now many decades old. Critically important for transferring electrical power between circuits, large power transformers average forty years old, with many in operation for an excess of seventy years. After power failures from disasters such as Hurricane Sandy on the U.S. east coast, the grid’s “reliability, effectiveness, and affordability are increasingly being brought into question.” However, not enough was done to fix the grid.\n## National Capital Area\nThis morning, breakfast is not available at the Hay Adams Hotel across from the White House. Nor were the doors open for business at Busboys and Poets at 2021 14th Street, NW. All the typical tourist attractions like the Smithsonian Museums remain closed, along with public schools. Classes are cancelled at American, Catholic, Georgetown, George Washington, Howard, and the University of the District of Columbia.\nThe bureaucratic army of the Potomac is estimated to employ over 500,000 federal workers, not counting the thousands of lawyers and consultants that perform work primarily for the U.S. government.

This submarine fiber optic network is “the physical infrastructure that underpins the virtual cloud of cyberspace.” Since its advent in 1977, the fiber optic cable system has experienced rampant growth. Thomas Friedman observes, “around the year 2000 we entered a whole new era, Globalization 3.0 . . . [which brings] the newfound power for individuals to collaborate and compete globally.” Friedman contends this development allows rapid circulation of digital content at almost no cost, thus creating global collaboration. Therefore, “[g]lobalization 3.0 is going to be more and more driven not only by individuals but also by a much more diverse—non-western, non white—group of individuals. Individuals from every corner of the flat world are being empowered.”\n---\n *Contact Us*, NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY, https://www.nsa.gov/about/contact-us/ (last visited Nov. 17, 2016).\n *Contact CIA*, CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY, https://www.cia.gov/index.html# (last visited Nov. 17, 2016).\n Barbara Maranzani, 9 *Things You May Not Know About the Pentagon*, HISTORY.COM (Jan. 15, 2013), http://www.history.com/news/9-things-you-may-not-know-about-the-pentagon.\n Tara Davenport, *Submarine Cables, Cybersecurity and International Law: An Intersectional Analysis*, 24 CATH.

Almost overnight, money has no meaning; bartering replaces currency for transactions, and the American economy grinds to a halt. Banks are closed, and ATM machines fail to operate.\nDown on Wall Street, although emergency backup systems are capable of trading securities, orders to buy or sell are not received in New York, as Boston area brokerage offices lack telephone service and have no ability to communicate. Commerce ceases nationwide as the power grid continues to stay down. Backup systems powered by fossil fuels soon deplete their supplies of coal, gas, diesel, kerosene, *et cetera*. Much like the great blizzard of 2015, snow is piled up everywhere. Schools have not reopened since Zero Day. Public transportation remains closed. After several days, snow removal is finally abandoned for lack of fuel and because workers choose to be at home with their families.\n Davenport, *supra* note 20, at 62 (citing G.A.

But this time, things are different.\nIt’s been almost ten days now since electricity went out across forty-seven states. For a while, hospitals are okay with their backup power sources. Within a week or so, many start to run out of fuel to power their generators. At first, elective surgeries are postponed. Several days later as power becomes increasingly scarce, medical monitoring machines fail and lab testing stops. Doctors, nurses, and other healthcare workers cannot make their way between home and work. By now, most hospitals are desperately understaffed, without fuel or other sources of functioning power. Many hospitals simply fail and services stop, with no place to send their patients. The sick start to die and bodies pile up. Without electricity, gas stations cannot pump gas, streetlights and traffic signals are dark, and those who can make it through the snow soon empty grocery stores of all remaining usable food.\nAt sub-freezing temperatures; humans and their habitats are in peril. As buildings shed their heat, staying warm becomes a challenge. The elderly and the very young succumb first. After the first few days, finding fire for warmth becomes difficult and causes panic. After firewood supplies are consumed, all things paper, and even fine furniture, are burned for warmth. Staying warm in large cities proves particularly challenging. The silent killer of carbon monoxide poisoning leads to accidental deaths.\nWhen elevators fail to work, having navigated many flights of stairs in the dark to get home, many of those living in apartment buildings stay inside. It takes days for emergency workers to rescue those caught in stalled elevators when the power failed. Fire becomes an unchecked inferno, as desperate city dwellers create fires from anything that will burn. In the absence of vital emergency services, these fires inevitably become uncontrollable. First buildings, then entire neighborhoods, burn out of control.\n April Kahn, *What Is Carbon Monoxide Poisoning?*, HEALTHLINE (Dec. 1 2015), http://www.healthline.com/health/carbon-monoxide-poisoning#Overview1.\n\n[VOL. 18: 233]\nWith transportation halted, after a week or so hunger forces many to go into the cold in search of something to eat.\n## The Midwest in February\nThe weather in Chicago is almost always horrible in February. This year is no different. Many resourceful residents in Evanston and the more affluent suburbs use their gas fireplaces for cooking. However, this proves to be much easier to do in theory than in practice. Before long, cooking grease results in fires and dangerous and painful burns. Similar human misery is found throughout the mid-west as cities like Detroit, Cleveland, Columbus and St. Louis quickly stall to a frozen halt.\n## In the South\nThose in warmer climates find survival moderately easier. In rural areas, crops and livestock provide sustenance. Many revert to those survival skills typical of life on the prairie two hundred years earlier. Even worse than the gas lines of the 1970s, service station fuel pumps fail for lack of electrical power, and transportation soon stops as cars are rendered useless due to lack of fuel. Railroad and truck food distribution systems in the South also fail, and the population soon grows hungry. Hunting and fishing moves from being a hobby to a necessity, and survival gains a renewed importance in daily life. Particularly in densely populated areas, household pets soon disappear, along with the residents of many local zoos. Animal shelters everywhere are no longer needed. Easy availability of firearms results in a rapid shift of vital resources between the “haves” and “have nots.”\nAs the homeless have known for years, survival in warmer climates, such as in Florida, is easier during the winter. Unlike the frozen northeast, it is actually possible to sleep outdoors during the winter. As a result, many families in the northern parts of the United States, having abandoned all their belongings, once their\n Christian Farr, *Record-Breaking Cold Air Grips Chicago*, NBC CHICAGO 5 (Feb. 19, 2015), http://www.nbcchicago.com/weather/stories/chicago-weather-record-cold-thursday-february-18-292218691.html.\nDEC 2016] Is Cyberattack the Next Pearl Harbor? 245\ngas runs out now find themselves stranded in their cars somewhere between home and their southern destinations.\n## The Importance of Water\nAs those in the western part of the United States have known for years, water scarcity is a life or death issue. Messrs. Papa, Casper, and Moore state that “[s]upervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems and industrial control systems (ICSs) are widely used to control systems such as water supply systems, wastewater collection and treatment facilities... Unfortunately, ... these systems are vulnerable to command injection and middle-person attacks.”\nJames Fugate, now Administrator of the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), developed his emergency management skills while serving as Florida’s State Coordinating Officer during eleven federal disasters, including the four major hurricanes impacting Florida in 2004, and three more in 2005.

Our systems, from water treatment to hospitals to traffic control to all [those] things that we expect every day, our ability to operate without electricity is minimal.” The availability of water is a major priority at all times, particularly during a disruptive crisis such as a cyberattack. According to Fugate,\nThat means we need to have enough power to pump, treat, and distribute water through the system. You have to keep the water system up, and you’ve gotta [sic] then focus on the water treatment system. Backing up sewage is just about as bad. Those two pieces will buy you enough time to look at what your alternatives are. Basically, people have to drink water, they have to eat, that waste has to go somewhere, they need medical care, they need a safe environment. There has to be order of law there.\nThe nation’s water supply presents numerous vulnerabilities. The control system of a small dam within twenty miles of New York City was reported to have been hacked by Iranian hackers in 2013. The DOJ unsealed an indictment during March 2016 charging a defendant who was working on behalf of the Iranian Government to hack into the supervisory control and data acquisition systems of the Rye, New York Bowman Dam, thereby providing the ability to control flow rates and water levels.\n See KOPPEL, supra note 6, at 117.\n See id. at 118.\n See Danny Yadron, Iranian Hacking Threat Emerges, WALL ST.

After the relatively few commercial and home generators run out of their fuel sources, batteries for personal computers, iPads, iPhones, and all other hand-held devices soon lack connectivity and the ability to gain battery recharge. While public broadcasting facilities tend to have backup generators, cable television likely does not operate in most homes due to the lack of household electrical power.

On December 6 through 7, U.S. code breakers intercepted a 14-part message, the so-called ‘War Warning,’ which ended with orders to break off any further talks with the Americans at precisely 1:00 p.m. Washington time (7:30 a.m. Hawaii time) on December 7.\nAmerican code-breaker and mathematics teacher Frank Rowlett observes, “As I look back at all the messages and other information available to us . . . it becomes crystal clear to me that this message ordering the destruction of certain of Washington’s codes provided the necessary evidence . . . which would make war between the United States and Japan a certainty.” Pearl Harbor had not been protected. As Kahn writes, “Japan had sealed all possible leaks. The ambassadors in Washington were not told of the attacks. Knowledge of it was limited in Toyko to as tight a circle as possible . . . No reference to a raid on Pearl Harbor ever went on the air, even coded.” In a tragedy of errors, “[d]isorganization and divided responsibility had cost America dearly.” It had taken fifteen and a half hours after message No.\n See Kahn, supra note 52.\n KROSS, supra note 53, at 269.; see also FRED B.

Seven prior investigations concerning the Pearl Harbor attack produced “9,754 printed pages of testimony from 318 witnesses and the attendant 469 exhibits.” The work of the Joint Committee itself resulted in the taking of some 15,000 pages of testimony “and a total of 183 exhibits received incident to an examination of 43 witnesses.” The report asks why “with the almost certain knowledge that war was at hand, with plans that contemplated the precise type of attack that was executed by Japan on the morning of December 7—[w]hy was it possible for Pearl Harbor to occur?”\n## Lessons from History\nThe surprise attack on Pearl Harbor is not an event anyone under the age of seventy-five will remember from actual life experiences. Therefore, the knowledge most U.S. citizens have about Pearl Harbor comes from history books and may seem increasingly remote as the years pass. For many families, the oral histories passed down by parents and grandparents are how many contemporary Americans remember and learn about Pearl Harbor. Michael McCaul, Chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, recalls, “My dad’s mission—the mission that millions of other young Americans joined after the attack on Pearl Harbor—was to help roll back the threat posed by a radical\n *Id.* at 61.\n S.

Tactical information victories, such as the information skirmishes that preceded the Battle of Midway, highlighted the increasing interaction of advanced communications technologies with strategic deception tactics for operational advantage.” As Professor Chris Bronk observes, “[h]ow states behave with regard to the Internet appears to matter more and more within international affairs . . . [and] Internet conflict may be a new area of international behavior falling somewhere between diplomacy and military action.”\nWhile a detailed discussion of the law of cyberwar is beyond the scope of this paper, any threshold inquiry must start with the question, “What exactly constitutes ‘warfare?’” According to Nineteenth century military theorist Carl von Clausewitz, an act of war requires that aggressive or defensive conduct be (1) “violent or potentially violent, (2) “instrumental: [where] physical violence or the threat of force is a means to compel the enemy to accept the attacker’s will,” and (3) “attributable to one side at some point\n MICHAEL MCCAUL, FAILURES OF IMAGINATION: THE DEADLIEST THREATS TO OUR HOMELAND—AND HOW TO THWART THEM 5 (New York: Crown Forum 2016).\n GEORGE SANTAYANA, THE LIFE OF REASON OR THE PHASES OF PROGRESS 284 (Charles Scribner’s Sons 1905).\n See JULIE RYAN, LEADING ISSUES IN INFORMATION WARFARE AND SECURITY RESEARCH vii (ACPI, 2015).\n Id.\n See Christopher Bronk, Blown to Bits: China’s War in Cyberspace, August-September 2020, 5 STRAT.

Actions online affect actions offline, and vice versa. Thus, far from being separate from conventional war, as Rid [contends], cyberwar is deeply embedded in contemporary military practices.” Moreover, “[c]yberwar, in fact, is part of the evolution of conventional warfare, which itself is linked to broader social and political change . . .”\nIn addition to causing physical injury or death, violence can refer to mental abuse and different forms of deprivation. The academic discipline of peace studies has for decades advanced the concept of structural violence, such as racism and sexism. In its widest sense, then, violence can be found in almost any coercive situation. And the various attacks and activities associated with cyberwar, from stealing data to disrupting other governments’ computer systems, clearly fall within this broad category.\nThis debate, carried out in the pages of *Foreign Affairs*, includes Thomas Rid’s concurrence that cyberspace activities are indeed “an inherent part of conventional warfare . . .

CONTEMPORARY WARNINGS IGNORED\n“Knowing what we know now, there will be no explaining our inaction after the next attack.”\nGen. Michael V. Hayden\nFormer Director of the National Security Agency and CIA76\nSinger and Friedman believe that “[d]efining cyberwar need not be so complicated. The key elements of war in cyberspace all have their parallels and connections to warfare in other domains . . . war always has a political goal and mode (which distinguishes it from crime) and always has an element of violence.”77 For example, “the US government’s position is that to meet this definition of the use of force, a cyberattack would have to ‘proximately result in death, injury or significant destruction.’ That is, even if conducted through cyber means, the effect must be physical damage or destruction.”78\nHouse Homeland Security Chairman Michael McCaul reflected on the 9/11 Commission’s “lack of readiness;” finding, where\n\n[VOL: 18: 233\n\"[t]he most important failure was one of imagination.\" For those age thirty-five or younger, it may be hard to recognize that widespread availability of the Internet dates back only to the 1990s in the United States.

For example,\nIn 2007, U.S. soldiers took smartphone photos of a group of new U.S. Army helicopters parked at a base in Iraq and then uploaded them to the Internet. The helicopters weren't classified and the photos showed no seemingly useful information to the enemy. But the soldiers didn't realize the photos also included \"geotags,\" which revealed where the photographers had been standing. Insurgents then used these geotags to pinpoint and destroy four of the helicopters in a mortar attack. Experts now use this example to warn people to be more careful about what they share when engaged in an important activity.\n## Warnings Abound\nDespite the repeated warnings from arguably the best and brightest among us, actual action has proved too little too late. Congress finally passed five major pieces of cybersecurity legislation during December 2014, the first cybersecurity laws enacted in more than a decade. By the time the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign was underway, and following the late 2015 terrorist strikes in Paris, San Bernardino, and Brussels, national security and cyber vulnerability had become topics of major concern to the American public.

Perhaps the most tangible effect of this terrorist activity is the momentum it provided to enact the Cybersecurity Act of 2015.”85 Observing that “[t]he omnibus $1.1 trillion spending law also includes hundreds of millions of dollars to add cybersecurity for the IRS, EPA, and other agencies,” Dean Garon warns, “[t]he law provides little more than a fig leaf for privacy protection, so only the development of final implementing regulations will determine whether there are meaningful safeguards from the potential abuse of the data sharing provisions to intrude on individual privacy.”86\nGeneral Michael V. Hayden, former director of both the National Security Agency (“NSA”) and Central Intelligence Agency (“CIA”) warned during 2011 that\n[o]ur most pressing need is clear policy, formed by shared consensus, shaped by informed discussion, and created by a common body of knowledge. With no common knowledge, no meaningful discussion, and no consensus ... the policy vacuum continues. This will not be easy ... it will require courage; but, it is essential and should itself be the subject of intense discussion.87\nCommander of U.S. Cyber Command and National Security Agency (“NSA”) Admiral Mike Rogers characterized “cyber attacks as the greatest long-term threat to national security in part\n\nDEC 2016] Is Cyberattack the Next Pearl Harbor? 259\nbecause ‘we have yet to come to a broad policy and legal consensus.’”\nAlso during 2011, Deputy Secretary of Defense William Lynn stated, “If we can minimize the impact of attacks on our operations and attribute them quickly and definitively, we may be able to change the decision calculus of an attacker.” According to the Pentagon, the volume of intellectual property stolen annually exceeds the amount of information contained in the Library of Congress.\nDuring April 2012, subcommittees of the U.S. House Committee on Homeland Security held hearings on the topic of “Iranian Cyber Threat to the U.S. Homeland.” On August 8, 2012, John O.

Coupled with Internet adoption patterns, we are witnessing a dramatic shift in the size, complexity, and diversity of cyber security attacks.” Before Congress, Kurose testified that the United States:\nNeeds to continue its investments in game-changing research if our cyber systems are to be trustworthy now and in the future. As you know, every day, we learn about more sophisticated and dangerous attacks. Why is the cyber security challenge so hard? The general answer is that attacks and defenses co-evolve: a system that was secure yesterday might no longer be secure tomorrow. More specific responses to this question include:\n- The technology base of our critical infrastructure systems is frequently updated to improve functionality, availability, and/or performance. New systems introduce new vulnerabilities (unknowable in the lab) that need new defenses when put into practice.\n- The environments in which our computing systems are rapidly developed and deployed, and the functionality that they provide are also not static. With entirely new computing models/platforms, like cloud and mobile computing, come new content and function, which in turn create new opportunities and incentives for attack and disruption.\n- As the automation of complex system interdependencies comes to pervade our critical infrastructure, new kinds of cascading vulnerabilities can be accidentally created and subsequently discovered in these systems, including the electric power grid, automated transportation networks, and robotic medical systems.\n- The sophistication of attackers is increasing as well as their sheer number and the specificity of their targets.\n- As information and systems are increasingly connected, and are increasingly composed of software and hardware\n *Id.*\nDEC 2016] Is Cyberattack the Next Pearl Harbor?\n\n- As more systems and data become accessible, information that was once low risk becomes high risk through correlation that was unimaginable only a few years ago.\n- Achieving system trustworthiness is not purely a technology problem. System developers, purchasers, operators and users all have a role to play in system security, and ways to incentivize positive behaviors are required. Security mechanisms that are not convenient will be circumvented; security mechanisms that are difficult to understand will be ignored or misinterpreted. Indeed, cyber security is a multi-dimensional challenge, requiring expertise in computer science, mathematics, economics, behavioral sciences, and education.\nIn Congressional testimony given on March 4, 2015, Navy Admiral Michael S. Rogers, commander of the U.S. Cyber Command and director of the National Security Agency, stated:\nEvery conflict in the world today has a cyber dimension ... The most worrisome of these campaigns are state-sponsored, persistent, and worldwide in scope. They are aimed at governments, non-profits, and corporations wherever they might be accruing intellectual capital that the attackers believe could be valuable, whether for re-sale or passage to competing firms and industries ... We see states developing capabilities and attaining accesses for potential hostilities, perhaps with the idea of enhancing deterrence or as a beachhead for future cyber sabotage. Private security researchers over the last year have reported on numerous malware finds in the industrial control systems of energy sector organizations ... We believe potential adversaries might be leaving cyber fingerprints on our critical infrastructure partly to convey a message that\n *Id.*\n\n[VOL. 18: 233\nour homeland is at risk if tensions ever escalate toward military conflict.\nTime and time again, specific warnings have been presented to Congress about what needs to be done by government and private organizations to increase their cybersecurity defenses. Secretary of Defense Ash Carter cautioned, “The same Internet that enables Wikipedia also allows terrorists to learn how to build a bomb. And the same technologies we use to target cruise missiles and jam enemy air defenses can be used against our own forces—and they’re now available to the highest bidder.” Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Navy Admiral James A. Winnefeld, Jr. said, “Today, 96 percent of our most advanced electronic warfare systems are assembled with commercially available components. We only add 4 percent worth of ‘special sauce.’ That means adversaries can quickly copy advanced U.S. systems with globally sourced components.” Ash Carter warned that “[w]hether it’s in the cloud, infrared cameras, or the GPS signals that provide navigation for ride-sharing apps, but also for aircraft carriers and our smart bombs—our reliance on technology has led to real vulnerabilities that our adversaries are eager to exploit.”\nSecretary of Defense, Ash Carter, explains nation-states, terrorist, and criminal networks are “increasing their cyber operations.

FBI Director James B. Comey describes the controversial problem known as “going dark” to the Senate Judiciary Committee as “the growing challenges to public safety and national security that have eroded our ability to obtain electronic information and evidence pursuant to a court order or warrant.” In testimony given to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, Director Comey observes that we “live in a technologically driven society and just as private industry has adapted to modern forms of communication so too have the terrorists. Unfortunately, changing forms of internet communication are quickly outpacing laws and technology designed to allow for the lawful intercept of communication content.”\nLaw Professor Peter Swire reports that the Review Group, having full awareness of concerns about the “going dark” controversy, “sharply criticized any attempt to introduce vulnerabilities into commercially available products and services, and found that even temporary vulnerabilities should be authorized only after administration-wide scrutiny.” Moreover, based on\n *Id.*\n FBI Executives: Director James Comey, FBI, https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/fbi-executives.\n *Going Dark: Encryption, Tech., and the Balance Between Pub.

These types of practice exercises and vulnerability testing often produce valuable lessons.\n## Impact of Technological Change\nAccording to Frank Cilluffo, the growing pace of cyberattacks “is magnified by the speed at which technologies continue to evolve and by the fact that our adversaries continue to adapt their tactics, techniques and procedures in order to evade and defeat our prevention and response measures.” This means that the likelihood of cyberattack increases on almost a daily basis due to technological advances in big data; brain-computer interfaces;\n See Mathew J.

If one party . . . uses compromised encryption as required in that country, then those globally who communicate with that country will have their communications compromised as well.”\nThis vulnerability is a particular problem because of lax data security in many other parts of the world where U.S.-generated data traffic either passes through or is destined. The significant growth in either the development or maintenance of computer code via business process outsourcing (“BPO”) by American companies to businesses located in such countries as India may be a critical weakness leading up to a cyber Pearl Harbor.\n## VI. WHAT IS TO BE DONE?\n“Terrorists will almost certainly continue to benefit . . . from a new generation of recruits proficient in information technology, social media, and online research. Some terrorists will look to use these technologies to increase the speed of their communications, the availability of their propaganda, and ability to collaborate with new partners.

Today, the prime topics reflected in most strategies include: outlining organizational and positional authority within the government; fostering awareness and education among citizens; building an incident and crisis management response capability; expanding law enforcement’s capacity to deal with the rate of cyber crimes; facilitating private-public partnerships and developing trusted information sharing exchanges; and\nNAL.pdf (statement of Hon.

Clarke, Michael J. Stone, Cass R. Sunstein &amp; Peter Swire state that:\nWhen public officials acquire foreign intelligence information, they seek to reduce risks, above all risks to national security. The challenge, of course, is that multiple risks are involved. Government must consider all of those risks, not a subset, when it is creating sensible safeguards.

Rogers observes:\nI liken our historical moment to the situation that confronted the U.S. early in the Cold War, when it became obvious that the Soviet Union and others could build hydrogen bombs and the superpower competition showed worrying signs of instability. We rapidly learned that we needed a nuclear force that was deployed across the three legs of the triad and underpinned by robust command and control mechanisms, far-reaching intelligence, and policy structures including a declared deterrence posture. Building these nuclear forces and the policy and support structures around them took time and did not cause a nuclear war or make the world less safe. On the contrary, it made deterrence predictable, helped to lower tensions, and ultimately facilitated arms control negotiations.

Just as we fashioned a formidable nuclear capability that served us through the Cold War and beyond, I am confident in our ability to keep pace with adversaries who are determined to control “their” corners of cyberspace, to exfiltrate our intellectual property, and to disrupt the functioning of our institutions. They are every bit as determined, creative, and persistent in these efforts as the Soviet leaders we contained during the Cold War, and unfortunately we see few hints they will act more responsibly in cyberspace. Thus we must commit to the long-term goal of building a truly open, secure cyberspace governed collaboratively by many stakeholders, while we remain prepared for crises and contingencies that can arise along the way—just as we do in every other domain.\nBy the end of 2015, Harvard’s Jessica Stein observes, “[l]ooking forward, cyberterrorism and cyberwar will likely pose a more serious threat to Americans’ well-being than conventional terrorist violence, and government surveillance is and will remain an essential weapon against cyberattacks.”\nDuring early 2016, President Barack Obama, while announcing his new cyber budget provisions and cybersecurity initiatives, stated:\nMy budget includes more than $19 billion for cybersecurity, which is up by more than one-third. And with this plan, we intend to modernize federal IT by replacing and retiring outdated systems that are vulnerable to attack... one of the biggest gaps between the public\n Cyber Operations: Improving the Military Cyber Security Posture in an Uncertain Threat Environment: Hearing Before the Subcomm. on Emerging Threats and Capabilities of the H.

Our Social Security system still runs on a Cobalt platform that dates back to the ‘60s. Our IRS systems are archaic... If we’re going to really secure those in a serious way, then we need to upgrade them . . .\n## More Lessons from History\nJason Healey is a former Director of Cyber Policy during the Obama Administration and cautions that “[c]yber history has been forgotten, ignored as irrelevant, or intentionally falsified . . . [while] the issues faced today are largely reflected in, or are exactly the same as, those faced by the previous generation.” Today, recruiting skilled talent to defend against cyber attack remains a challenge. However, as Mr. Healey observes about cyber defenders,\nAs each new wave of entrants, every five years or so, feels that they are the pioneers. Since they are not taught any history of their field, many accordingly fail to distinguish between what is actually new versus what is just new to them. In addition, cyberspace not only has many characteristics which are non-intuitive to (older) policymakers, but it seems to be forever changing... Admittedly, the field is still emerging rapidly, and we are at the beginning of the ‘cyber age.’ But that is no reason to ignore the useful lessons of its current history.\n---\n *Remarks by the President Obama on New Cybersecurity Initiatives* (Feb. 9, 2016), https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/02/09/remarks-president-new-cybersecurity-initiatives (last viewed Apr. 13, 2016); see also *President Obama, Protecting U.S. Innovation from Cyberthreats*, WALL ST.

[And] in the earnest hope that something constructive may be accomplished that will aid our national defense and preclude a repetition of the disaster of December 7, 1941.” As our strategy evolves to detect, mitigate, and fight cyberattacks, reflection upon these principles, and how, if at all, they may differ in today’s rapidly changing technological environment, may prove helpful. The principles are as follows:\n1. Operational and intelligence work requires centralization of authority and clear-cut allocation of responsibility.\n2. Supervisory officials cannot safely take anything for granted in the alerting of subordinates.\n3. Any doubt as to whether outposts should be given information should always be resolved in favor of supplying the information.\n4. The delegation of authority or the issuance of orders entails the duty of inspection to determine that the official mandate is properly exercised.\n5. The implementation of official orders must be followed with closest supervision.\n6. The maintenance of alertness to responsibility must be insured through repetition.\n---\n S. Rep.

Complacency and procrastination are out of place where sudden and decisive action are of the essence.\n8. The coordination and proper evaluation of intelligence in times of stress must be insured by continuity of service and centralization of responsibility in competent officials.\n9. The unapproachable or superior attitude of officials is fatal. There should never be any hesitancy in asking for clarification of instructions or in seeking advice on matters that are in doubt.\n10. There is no substitute for imagination and resourcefulness on the part of supervisory and intelligence officials.\n11. Communications must be characterized by clarity, forthrightness, and appropriateness.\n12. There is great danger in careless paraphrase of information received and every effort should be made to insure that the paraphrased material reflects the true meaning of the original.\n13. Procedures must be sufficiently flexible to meet the exigencies of unusual situations.\n14. Restrictions of highly confidential information to a minimum number of officials, while often necessary, should not be carried to the point of prejudicing the work of the organization.\n15. There is great danger of being blinded by the self-evident.\n16. Officials should at all times give subordinates the benefit of significant information.\n17. An official who neglects to familiarize himself in detail with his organization should forfeit his responsibility.\n18. Failure can be avoided in the long run only by preparation for any eventuality.\n19. Officials, on a personal basis, should never countermand an official instruction.\n\n[VOL. 18: 233]\n20. Personal or official jealousy will wreck any organization.\n21. Personal friendship, without more, should never be accepted in lieu of liaison or confused therewith where the latter is necessary to the proper functioning of two or more agencies.\n22. No considerations should be permitted as an excuse for failure to perform a fundamental task.\n23. Superiors must at all times keep their subordinates adequately informed and, conversely, subordinates should keep their superiors informed.\n24. The administrative organization of any establishment must be designed to locate failures and to assess responsibility.\n25. In a well-balanced organization there is close correlation of responsibility and authority.\nA major difference between the environment surrounding Pearl Harbor and the cyber domain, according to Harvard National Security Fellow Steven Anderson, “is the fact that the military owns less than 15% of the cyberspace environment . . . so integration between the military/public/private sectors is absolutely critical if the nation is going to prevent an event as depicted earlier in this paper . . . let alone how to respond if/when it does occur.”\n## VII.

Enemies have probed and fully mapped the data systems of America’s important corporations and institutions. The future of the United States, represented by its intellectual property, has systematically been stolen by its adversaries.

DEC 2016] Is Cyberattack the Next Pearl Harbor? 289 With the power to wreak havoc on global economic and political stability, cyber issues remain likely the greatest single threat to modern civilization. Now, just as in the days and weeks immediately preceding the 1941 attack against the United States at Pearl Harbor, all the necessary warning signs are there. Enemies have probed and fully mapped the data systems of America’s important corporations and institutions. The future of the United States, represented by its intellectual property, has systematically been stolen by its adversaries. Initial sounding of the alarm, “the hackers are coming; the hackers are coming” may have already faded from deaf ears. However, beware, the hackers are here! The hackers are here! ^{}[] # NORTH CAROLINA JOURNAL OF LAW &amp; TECHNOLOGY ## VOLUME 18, ISSUE 3 MARCH 2017 Published by: | NC.

Although we must be prepared for a catastrophic, large-scale strike, a so-called ‘Cyber Armageddon,’ the reality is that we’ve been living with a constant and expanding barrage of cyber attacks for some time.”\nHon. James R. Clapper\nDirector of National Intelligence\nFebruary 26, 2015\n## I. OVERVIEW\nCentral Intelligence Agency Director, Leon Panetta, stated in his Secretary of Defense confirmation testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee that, “the next Pearl Harbor that we confront could very well be a cyberattack that cripples America’s electrical grid and its security and financial systems.” Cyberattacks have become a daily threat to businesses, consumers, and all nation states, resulting in the profound loss of economic assets and intellectual property.

Second, for historical perspective, the December 7, 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor is presented. Third is a review of contemporary and credible warnings. Fourth is a discussion about the privacy versus national security debate, and geopolitical developments that might determine how a cyber drama is played-out on the world stage. Fifth, the question of what is to be done is addressed. Next, the 1946 Congressional Joint Committee on the Investigation of the Pearl Harbor Attack’s recommended principles (designed to prevent the repetition of such a future attack) is reviewed with our contemporary environment in mind.\n## II.

It’s a Tuesday morning in February. Without fanfare or warning, Americans awake to find that nothing works. In Wellesley, Massachusetts, sixth graders at Horatio H. Hunnewell Elementary School on Cameron Street awoke later than usual because alarm clocks failed to provide their normal wake-up call. Meanwhile, just a few miles away in South Boston, the fire fighters of Engine Company 39, Ladder 18 receive delayed notice of homes ablaze because the phone system is down. First responders arrive at their destinations later than normal because traffic lights are not functioning. Everywhere this morning, fire fighters are busy dealing with fires, hamstrung because fire hydrants are not operational due to electrical outages that cause pumps to fail. Those individuals reliant on electrical medical devices are struggling, and confusion is widespread.\nThis Tuesday morning, the electrical grids in the eastern and western United States fail. As a result, all states except for Texas, Alaska and Hawaii (which have their own grids) are without power. The government declares a state of emergency and promises to locate the problem and restore services as soon as possible. Emergency generators provide power for some essential services such as hospitals and public broadcasters. However, schools are closed, and public transportation proves intermittent at best. Inoperable traffic signals cause automobile travel to slow to a snail’s pace in major cities. Phone landlines are down for most businesses. Cell towers don’t work because of power loss. Some people use this “holiday” from work and school to venture out for necessities. However, stocked groceries and operating gas stations prove hard to come by since few sources have their own power generators. Most restaurants are unable to open due to lack of electricity and public transportation for their employees. With memories of 9/11 and the use of air transportation for purposes of\n See generally TED KOPPEL, LIGHTS OUT: A CYBERATTACK; A NATION UNPREPARED; SURVIVING THE AFTERMATH (Crown Pub., 2015) (depicting a future attack on U.S. power grids and its aftermath).

J.L. &amp; TECH. 139 (2015).\n\n[VOL. 18: 233\nterrorism still too fresh, immediate orders are given for all air traffic to land at the nearest possible airport. All originating air travel is cancelled, resulting in the stranding of travelers numbering in the tens of thousands, usually at unfamiliar airports. Even so, just before all aircraft could land, reports of compromised aircraft control systems are reported. Also, within recent memory are the terrorist attacks at Fort Hood, the Boston Marathon, Paris, San Bernardino, and Brussels.\n See generally Derek Jinks, September 11 and the Laws of War, 28 YALE J.

But this morning, no spinach &amp; feta omelets are served. Like Florida, southern Texas and Arizona, the West Coast—particularly southern California—benefits from a climate that is hospitable even during February. At the macro level, widespread losses of electrical power result in store closures and quicker defrost and spoilage of existing grocery store foodstuffs. The inability to pump gas at most service stations quickly results in long lines of cars waiting to fuel at the few open gas stations (before resupply trucks fail to make deliveries). Abandoned cars left on streets and highways soon become a major problem for the already congested Los Angeles area.\nIn northern California, Sandhill Road in Menlo Park, just a few minutes from Stanford University, is “ground zero” for America’s venture capital industry. This morning, many pillars of venture finance find themselves locked out of their offices when front door electronic security devices fail to operate. Classes are cancelled at Stanford, and lunch will not be served today along Fisherman’s Wharf in San Francisco.\nEven during February, the impact of global warming and wildfires prove to be problematic this year in the western United States. Lack of transportation hinders both first responder emergency services, such as firefighting efforts, and the ability to move agricultural products to heavily populated areas. Widespread\nZeckhauser, *Recollection Bias and Its Underpinnings: Lessons from Terrorism-Risk Assessments* (Harvard Kennedy Sch., Working Paper No. 16-003) (2015), http://ssrn.com/abstract=2692253.\n\n[VOL. 18: 233\nhunger soon becomes the primary cause of civil unrest and crime. Frightened people quickly resort to desperate measures.\nFor California, as in most of the United States, most component parts of the electrical grid are now many decades old. Critically important for transferring electrical power between circuits, large power transformers average forty years old, with many in operation for an excess of seventy years. After power failures from disasters such as Hurricane Sandy on the U.S. east coast, the grid’s “reliability, effectiveness, and affordability are increasingly being brought into question.” However, not enough was done to fix the grid.\n## National Capital Area\nThis morning, breakfast is not available at the Hay Adams Hotel across from the White House. Nor were the doors open for business at Busboys and Poets at 2021 14th Street, NW. All the typical tourist attractions like the Smithsonian Museums remain closed, along with public schools. Classes are cancelled at American, Catholic, Georgetown, George Washington, Howard, and the University of the District of Columbia.\nThe bureaucratic army of the Potomac is estimated to employ over 500,000 federal workers, not counting the thousands of lawyers and consultants that perform work primarily for the U.S. government. Almost all remain at home this day. As any thoughtful cyber warfare strategist might have predicted, an attack on the metropolitan Washington, DC – Baltimore metroplex is a focal point of the hostilities. Primary targets were the cyber warriors located at the suburban Washington, DC headquarters of\n Brian Warshay, *Upgrading the Grid: How to Modernize America’s Electrical Infrastructure*, FOREIGN AFF., Mar.–Apr. 2015, at 125.\n *Id.*\n *BUSBOYS AND POETS*, http://www.busboysandpoets.com/ (last visited Nov. 17, 2016).\n See *Federal Employees By State*, GOVERNING.COM, http://www.governing.com/gov-data/federal-employees-workforce-numbers-by-state.html (reporting data on the concentration of federal employees compiled from 2013 Bureau of Labor Statistics Current Employment Statistics).\nDEC 2016] · Is Cyberattack the Next Pearl Harbor? 241\nthe National Security Agency (NSA), the Northern Virginia defense community represented by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and the almost 30,000 employees who work at the Pentagon. In addition to these well-known agencies are the many whom the press seldom acknowledges as they engage in the mission of defending the United States against attacks both physical and virtual.\n## Day Three: Internet Backbone and Fiber Cable Destroyed\nBecause most had not enjoyed Internet availability since Zero Day due to lack of power, the sabotage and loss of the undersea international fiber cable system a few days after the initial attack on the U.S. power grid remained generally unnoticed. This submarine fiber optic network is “the physical infrastructure that underpins the virtual cloud of cyberspace.” Since its advent in 1977, the fiber optic cable system has experienced rampant growth. Thomas Friedman observes, “around the year 2000 we entered a whole new era, Globalization 3.0 . . . [which brings] the newfound power for individuals to collaborate and compete globally.” Friedman contends this development allows rapid circulation of digital content at almost no cost, thus creating global collaboration. Therefore, “[g]lobalization 3.0 is going to be more and more driven not only by individuals but also by a much more diverse—non-western, non white—group of individuals. Individuals from every corner of the flat world are being empowered.”\n---\n *Contact Us*, NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY, https://www.nsa.gov/about/contact-us/ (last visited Nov. 17, 2016).\n *Contact CIA*, CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY, https://www.cia.gov/index.html# (last visited Nov. 17, 2016).\n Barbara Maranzani, 9 *Things You May Not Know About the Pentagon*, HISTORY.COM (Jan. 15, 2013), http://www.history.com/news/9-things-you-may-not-know-about-the-pentagon.\n Tara Davenport, *Submarine Cables, Cybersecurity and International Law: An Intersectional Analysis*, 24 CATH.

Almost overnight, money has no meaning; bartering replaces currency for transactions, and the American economy grinds to a halt. Banks are closed, and ATM machines fail to operate.\nDown on Wall Street, although emergency backup systems are capable of trading securities, orders to buy or sell are not received in New York, as Boston area brokerage offices lack telephone service and have no ability to communicate. Commerce ceases nationwide as the power grid continues to stay down. Backup systems powered by fossil fuels soon deplete their supplies of coal, gas, diesel, kerosene, *et cetera*. Much like the great blizzard of 2015, snow is piled up everywhere. Schools have not reopened since Zero Day. Public transportation remains closed. After several days, snow removal is finally abandoned for lack of fuel and because workers choose to be at home with their families.\n Davenport, *supra* note 20, at 62 (citing G.A. Res. 65/37, ¶ 121 (Dec. 7, 2010)).\n Davenport, *supra* note 20, at 62 (citing LIONEL CARTER ET AL., SUBMARINE CABLES AND THE OCEANS: CONNECTING THE WORLD 8 (2009), http://www.iscpc.org/publications/ICPC-UNEP_Report.pdf).\n Davenport, *supra* note 20, at 63.\n Alex Sosnowski, *How Did East Coast Blizzard of 2015 Play Out?*, ACCUWEATHER (Jan. 31, 2015), http://www.accuweather.com/en/weather-news/what-happened-to-the-forecast/41294989.\nDEC 2016] Is Cyberattack the Next Pearl Harbor? 243\nAmbulance, fire, and police services quickly become missing in action. But this time, things are different.\nIt’s been almost ten days now since electricity went out across forty-seven states. For a while, hospitals are okay with their backup power sources. Within a week or so, many start to run out of fuel to power their generators. At first, elective surgeries are postponed. Several days later as power becomes increasingly scarce, medical monitoring machines fail and lab testing stops. Doctors, nurses, and other healthcare workers cannot make their way between home and work. By now, most hospitals are desperately understaffed, without fuel or other sources of functioning power. Many hospitals simply fail and services stop, with no place to send their patients. The sick start to die and bodies pile up. Without electricity, gas stations cannot pump gas, streetlights and traffic signals are dark, and those who can make it through the snow soon empty grocery stores of all remaining usable food.\nAt sub-freezing temperatures; humans and their habitats are in peril. As buildings shed their heat, staying warm becomes a challenge. The elderly and the very young succumb first. After the first few days, finding fire for warmth becomes difficult and causes panic. After firewood supplies are consumed, all things paper, and even fine furniture, are burned for warmth. Staying warm in large cities proves particularly challenging. The silent killer of carbon monoxide poisoning leads to accidental deaths.\nWhen elevators fail to work, having navigated many flights of stairs in the dark to get home, many of those living in apartment buildings stay inside. It takes days for emergency workers to rescue those caught in stalled elevators when the power failed. Fire becomes an unchecked inferno, as desperate city dwellers create fires from anything that will burn. In the absence of vital emergency services, these fires inevitably become uncontrollable. First buildings, then entire neighborhoods, burn out of control.\n April Kahn, *What Is Carbon Monoxide Poisoning?*, HEALTHLINE (Dec. 1 2015), http://www.healthline.com/health/carbon-monoxide-poisoning#Overview1.\n\n[VOL. 18: 233]\nWith transportation halted, after a week or so hunger forces many to go into the cold in search of something to eat.\n## The Midwest in February\nThe weather in Chicago is almost always horrible in February. This year is no different. Many resourceful residents in Evanston and the more affluent suburbs use their gas fireplaces for cooking. However, this proves to be much easier to do in theory than in practice. Before long, cooking grease results in fires and dangerous and painful burns. Similar human misery is found throughout the mid-west as cities like Detroit, Cleveland, Columbus and St. Louis quickly stall to a frozen halt.\n## In the South\nThose in warmer climates find survival moderately easier. In rural areas, crops and livestock provide sustenance. Many revert to those survival skills typical of life on the prairie two hundred years earlier. Even worse than the gas lines of the 1970s, service station fuel pumps fail for lack of electrical power, and transportation soon stops as cars are rendered useless due to lack of fuel. Railroad and truck food distribution systems in the South also fail, and the population soon grows hungry. Hunting and fishing moves from being a hobby to a necessity, and survival gains a renewed importance in daily life. Particularly in densely populated areas, household pets soon disappear, along with the residents of many local zoos. Animal shelters everywhere are no longer needed. Easy availability of firearms results in a rapid shift of vital resources between the “haves” and “have nots.”\nAs the homeless have known for years, survival in warmer climates, such as in Florida, is easier during the winter. Unlike the frozen northeast, it is actually possible to sleep outdoors during the winter.

Messrs. Papa, Casper, and Moore state that “[s]upervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems and industrial control systems (ICSs) are widely used to control systems such as water supply systems, wastewater collection and treatment facilities... Unfortunately, ... these systems are vulnerable to command injection and middle-person attacks.”\nJames Fugate, now Administrator of the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), developed his emergency management skills while serving as Florida’s State Coordinating Officer during eleven federal disasters, including the four major hurricanes impacting Florida in 2004, and three more in 2005. Fugate observes, “[w]e’re not a country that can\n See Stephen Papa, William Casper &amp; Tyler Moore, *Securing Wastewater Collection Systems from Accidental and Intentional Harm: A Cost-Benefit Analysis*, 6 INT’L.

Our systems, from water treatment to hospitals to traffic control to all [those] things that we expect every day, our ability to operate without electricity is minimal.” The availability of water is a major priority at all times, particularly during a disruptive crisis such as a cyberattack. According to Fugate,\nThat means we need to have enough power to pump, treat, and distribute water through the system. You have to keep the water system up, and you’ve gotta [sic] then focus on the water treatment system. Backing up sewage is just about as bad. Those two pieces will buy you enough time to look at what your alternatives are. Basically, people have to drink water, they have to eat, that waste has to go somewhere, they need medical care, they need a safe environment. There has to be order of law there.\nThe nation’s water supply presents numerous vulnerabilities. The control system of a small dam within twenty miles of New York City was reported to have been hacked by Iranian hackers in 2013. The DOJ unsealed an indictment during March 2016 charging a defendant who was working on behalf of the Iranian Government to hack into the supervisory control and data acquisition systems of the Rye, New York Bowman Dam, thereby providing the ability to control flow rates and water levels.\n See KOPPEL, supra note 6, at 117.\n See id. at 118.\n See Danny Yadron, Iranian Hacking Threat Emerges, WALL ST.

After the relatively few commercial and home generators run out of their fuel sources, batteries for personal computers, iPads, iPhones, and all other hand-held devices soon lack connectivity and the ability to gain battery recharge. While public broadcasting facilities tend to have backup generators, cable television likely does not operate in most homes due to the lack of household electrical power.

As a result, “[e]ighteen ships of the American Pacific Fleet were sunk or badly damaged, including eight battleships.” “One hundred and eighty-eight aircraft were destroyed (mostly on the ground) and 2,403 people were killed.” The United States declared war on Japan the next day and entered World War II.\n## Value of Code-breaking\nOf particular relevance to this discussion is the evidence suggesting that better and quicker communication between various elements of the U.S. intelligence apparatus could have saved lives by providing warning of the impending attack. In 1937, building on the work of great American cryptanalysts such as Herbert O. Yardley, Laurance F. Safford, Agnes Meyer Driscoll, William F. Friedman, Frank B. Rowlett, Genevieve Grotjan, and many others, relevant “solutions of intercepted foreign messages began flowing to the White House.”\nPeter Kross writes that “[i]n 1941, William Friedman had broken the Japanese cryptosystem called Purple, which allowed this country to read all the diplomatic traffic coming from Tokyo to its outposts around the world.” David Kahn writes that “[b]y late 1941 solutions . . . soared to 50 to 75 messages a day . . .

Tokyo to the ambassador in Washington declared: There is more reason than ever before for us to arm ourselves to the teeth for all-out war.” Moreover,\nIn the first week of December, 1941, the U.S. learned that the Japanese government gave instructions to its Washington embassy to start destroying its codes, a clear sign that diplomatic relations were about to be broken. On December 6 through 7, U.S. code breakers intercepted a 14-part message, the so-called ‘War Warning,’ which ended with orders to break off any further talks with the Americans at precisely 1:00 p.m. Washington time (7:30 a.m. Hawaii time) on December 7.\nAmerican code-breaker and mathematics teacher Frank Rowlett observes, “As I look back at all the messages and other information available to us . . . it becomes crystal clear to me that this message ordering the destruction of certain of Washington’s codes provided the necessary evidence . . . which would make war between the United States and Japan a certainty.” Pearl Harbor had not been protected. As Kahn writes, “Japan had sealed all possible leaks. The ambassadors in Washington were not told of the attacks. Knowledge of it was limited in Toyko to as tight a circle as possible . . . No reference to a raid on Pearl Harbor ever went on the air, even coded.” In a tragedy of errors, “[d]isorganization and divided responsibility had cost America dearly.” It had taken fifteen and a half hours after message No.\n See Kahn, supra note 52.\n KROSS, supra note 53, at 269.; see also FRED B.

Seven prior investigations concerning the Pearl Harbor attack produced “9,754 printed pages of testimony from 318 witnesses and the attendant 469 exhibits.” The work of the Joint Committee itself resulted in the taking of some 15,000 pages of testimony “and a total of 183 exhibits received incident to an examination of 43 witnesses.” The report asks why “with the almost certain knowledge that war was at hand, with plans that contemplated the precise type of attack that was executed by Japan on the morning of December 7—[w]hy was it possible for Pearl Harbor to occur?”\n## Lessons from History\nThe surprise attack on Pearl Harbor is not an event anyone under the age of seventy-five will remember from actual life experiences. Therefore, the knowledge most U.S. citizens have about Pearl Harbor comes from history books and may seem increasingly remote as the years pass. For many families, the oral histories passed down by parents and grandparents are how many contemporary Americans remember and learn about Pearl Harbor. Michael McCaul, Chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, recalls, “My dad’s mission—the mission that millions of other young Americans joined after the attack on Pearl Harbor—was to help roll back the threat posed by a radical\n *Id.* at 61.\n S.

Tactical information victories, such as the information skirmishes that preceded the Battle of Midway, highlighted the increasing interaction of advanced communications technologies with strategic deception tactics for operational advantage.” As Professor Chris Bronk observes, “[h]ow states behave with regard to the Internet appears to matter more and more within international affairs . . . [and] Internet conflict may be a new area of international behavior falling somewhere between diplomacy and military action.”\nWhile a detailed discussion of the law of cyberwar is beyond the scope of this paper, any threshold inquiry must start with the question, “What exactly constitutes ‘warfare?’” According to Nineteenth century military theorist Carl von Clausewitz, an act of war requires that aggressive or defensive conduct be (1) “violent or potentially violent, (2) “instrumental: [where] physical violence or the threat of force is a means to compel the enemy to accept the attacker’s will,” and (3) “attributable to one side at some point\n MICHAEL MCCAUL, FAILURES OF IMAGINATION: THE DEADLIEST THREATS TO OUR HOMELAND—AND HOW TO THWART THEM 5 (New York: Crown Forum 2016).\n GEORGE SANTAYANA, THE LIFE OF REASON OR THE PHASES OF PROGRESS 284 (Charles Scribner’s Sons 1905).\n See JULIE RYAN, LEADING ISSUES IN INFORMATION WARFARE AND SECURITY RESEARCH vii (ACPI, 2015).\n Id.\n See Christopher Bronk, Blown to Bits: China’s War in Cyberspace, August-September 2020, 5 STRAT.

Actions online affect actions offline, and vice versa. Thus, far from being separate from conventional war, as Rid [contends], cyberwar is deeply embedded in contemporary military practices.” Moreover, “[c]yberwar, in fact, is part of the evolution of conventional warfare, which itself is linked to broader social and political change . . .”\nIn addition to causing physical injury or death, violence can refer to mental abuse and different forms of deprivation. The academic discipline of peace studies has for decades advanced the concept of structural violence, such as racism and sexism. In its widest sense, then, violence can be found in almost any coercive situation. And the various attacks and activities associated with cyberwar, from stealing data to disrupting other governments’ computer systems, clearly fall within this broad category.\nThis debate, carried out in the pages of *Foreign Affairs*, includes Thomas Rid’s concurrence that cyberspace activities are indeed “an inherent part of conventional warfare . . .

CONTEMPORARY WARNINGS IGNORED\n“Knowing what we know now, there will be no explaining our inaction after the next attack.”\nGen. Michael V. Hayden\nFormer Director of the National Security Agency and CIA76\nSinger and Friedman believe that “[d]efining cyberwar need not be so complicated. The key elements of war in cyberspace all have their parallels and connections to warfare in other domains . . . war always has a political goal and mode (which distinguishes it from crime) and always has an element of violence.”77 For example, “the US government’s position is that to meet this definition of the use of force, a cyberattack would have to ‘proximately result in death, injury or significant destruction.’ That is, even if conducted through cyber means, the effect must be physical damage or destruction.”78\nHouse Homeland Security Chairman Michael McCaul reflected on the 9/11 Commission’s “lack of readiness;” finding, where\n\n[VOL: 18: 233\n\"[t]he most important failure was one of imagination.\" For those age thirty-five or younger, it may be hard to recognize that widespread availability of the Internet dates back only to the 1990s in the United States.

For example,\nIn 2007, U.S. soldiers took smartphone photos of a group of new U.S. Army helicopters parked at a base in Iraq and then uploaded them to the Internet. The helicopters weren't classified and the photos showed no seemingly useful information to the enemy. But the soldiers didn't realize the photos also included \"geotags,\" which revealed where the photographers had been standing. Insurgents then used these geotags to pinpoint and destroy four of the helicopters in a mortar attack. Experts now use this example to warn people to be more careful about what they share when engaged in an important activity.\n## Warnings Abound\nDespite the repeated warnings from arguably the best and brightest among us, actual action has proved too little too late. Congress finally passed five major pieces of cybersecurity legislation during December 2014, the first cybersecurity laws enacted in more than a decade. By the time the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign was underway, and following the late 2015 terrorist strikes in Paris, San Bernardino, and Brussels, national security and cyber vulnerability had become topics of major concern to the American public.

Perhaps the most tangible effect of this terrorist activity is the momentum it provided to enact the Cybersecurity Act of 2015.”85 Observing that “[t]he omnibus $1.1 trillion spending law also includes hundreds of millions of dollars to add cybersecurity for the IRS, EPA, and other agencies,” Dean Garon warns, “[t]he law provides little more than a fig leaf for privacy protection, so only the development of final implementing regulations will determine whether there are meaningful safeguards from the potential abuse of the data sharing provisions to intrude on individual privacy.”86\nGeneral Michael V. Hayden, former director of both the National Security Agency (“NSA”) and Central Intelligence Agency (“CIA”) warned during 2011 that\n[o]ur most pressing need is clear policy, formed by shared consensus, shaped by informed discussion, and created by a common body of knowledge. With no common knowledge, no meaningful discussion, and no consensus ... the policy vacuum continues. This will not be easy ... it will require courage; but, it is essential and should itself be the subject of intense discussion.87\nCommander of U.S. Cyber Command and National Security Agency (“NSA”) Admiral Mike Rogers characterized “cyber attacks as the greatest long-term threat to national security in part\n\nDEC 2016] Is Cyberattack the Next Pearl Harbor? 259\nbecause ‘we have yet to come to a broad policy and legal consensus.’”\nAlso during 2011, Deputy Secretary of Defense William Lynn stated, “If we can minimize the impact of attacks on our operations and attribute them quickly and definitively, we may be able to change the decision calculus of an attacker.” According to the Pentagon, the volume of intellectual property stolen annually exceeds the amount of information contained in the Library of Congress.\nDuring April 2012, subcommittees of the U.S. House Committee on Homeland Security held hearings on the topic of “Iranian Cyber Threat to the U.S. Homeland.” On August 8, 2012, John O.

Johnson cautioned that in their daily lives, Americans are finding that “cyberspace is vulnerable to an ever-evolving range of threats.” Secretary Johnson further observes that this vulnerability stems “from criminals to nation-state actors, ranging in purpose from identity and data theft to espionage and disruption of critical functions. As our Nation’s reliance on cyber networks has grown, incidents which impact the safety and confidence with which we operate online have become increasingly commonplace.”\nBy early 2015, James F.

Coupled with Internet adoption patterns, we are witnessing a dramatic shift in the size, complexity, and diversity of cyber security attacks.” Before Congress, Kurose testified that the United States:\nNeeds to continue its investments in game-changing research if our cyber systems are to be trustworthy now and in the future. As you know, every day, we learn about more sophisticated and dangerous attacks. Why is the cyber security challenge so hard? The general answer is that attacks and defenses co-evolve: a system that was secure yesterday might no longer be secure tomorrow. More specific responses to this question include:\n- The technology base of our critical infrastructure systems is frequently updated to improve functionality, availability, and/or performance. New systems introduce new vulnerabilities (unknowable in the lab) that need new defenses when put into practice.\n- The environments in which our computing systems are rapidly developed and deployed, and the functionality that they provide are also not static. With entirely new computing models/platforms, like cloud and mobile computing, come new content and function, which in turn create new opportunities and incentives for attack and disruption.\n- As the automation of complex system interdependencies comes to pervade our critical infrastructure, new kinds of cascading vulnerabilities can be accidentally created and subsequently discovered in these systems, including the electric power grid, automated transportation networks, and robotic medical systems.\n- The sophistication of attackers is increasing as well as their sheer number and the specificity of their targets.\n- As information and systems are increasingly connected, and are increasingly composed of software and hardware\n *Id.*\nDEC 2016] Is Cyberattack the Next Pearl Harbor?\n\n- As more systems and data become accessible, information that was once low risk becomes high risk through correlation that was unimaginable only a few years ago.\n- Achieving system trustworthiness is not purely a technology problem. System developers, purchasers, operators and users all have a role to play in system security, and ways to incentivize positive behaviors are required. Security mechanisms that are not convenient will be circumvented; security mechanisms that are difficult to understand will be ignored or misinterpreted. Indeed, cyber security is a multi-dimensional challenge, requiring expertise in computer science, mathematics, economics, behavioral sciences, and education.\nIn Congressional testimony given on March 4, 2015, Navy Admiral Michael S. Rogers, commander of the U.S. Cyber Command and director of the National Security Agency, stated:\nEvery conflict in the world today has a cyber dimension ... The most worrisome of these campaigns are state-sponsored, persistent, and worldwide in scope. They are aimed at governments, non-profits, and corporations wherever they might be accruing intellectual capital that the attackers believe could be valuable, whether for re-sale or passage to competing firms and industries ... We see states developing capabilities and attaining accesses for potential hostilities, perhaps with the idea of enhancing deterrence or as a beachhead for future cyber sabotage. Private security researchers over the last year have reported on numerous malware finds in the industrial control systems of energy sector organizations ... We believe potential adversaries might be leaving cyber fingerprints on our critical infrastructure partly to convey a message that\n *Id.*\n\n[VOL. 18: 233\nour homeland is at risk if tensions ever escalate toward military conflict.\nTime and time again, specific warnings have been presented to Congress about what needs to be done by government and private organizations to increase their cybersecurity defenses. Secretary of Defense Ash Carter cautioned, “The same Internet that enables Wikipedia also allows terrorists to learn how to build a bomb. And the same technologies we use to target cruise missiles and jam enemy air defenses can be used against our own forces—and they’re now available to the highest bidder.” Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Navy Admiral James A. Winnefeld, Jr. said, “Today, 96 percent of our most advanced electronic warfare systems are assembled with commercially available components. We only add 4 percent worth of ‘special sauce.’ That means adversaries can quickly copy advanced U.S. systems with globally sourced components.” Ash Carter warned that “[w]hether it’s in the cloud, infrared cameras, or the GPS signals that provide navigation for ride-sharing apps, but also for aircraft carriers and our smart bombs—our reliance on technology has led to real vulnerabilities that our adversaries are eager to exploit.”\nSecretary of Defense, Ash Carter, explains nation-states, terrorist, and criminal networks are “increasing their cyber operations. Low-cost and global proliferation of malware have lowered barriers to entry and made it easier for smaller malicious actors to strike in cyberspace.

He stated, “[T]errorist groups operating in-permissive environments present a significant security threat to the U.S. and our allies . . . [T]he terrorist threat is fluid and cannot be associated with one group, race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, or geographic location.” And, as DHS’s Andy Ozment, Assistant Secretary for Cybersecurity and Communications, stated, “[U]ltimately, there exists no perfect cyber defense, and persistent adversaries will find ways to infiltrate networks in both government and the private sector.”\n## Cyberattack: A National Security Issue\n“The next Pearl Harbor that we confront could very well be a cyberattack that cripples America’s electrical grid and its security and financial systems,” observed Central Intelligence Agency Director Leon Panetta in his June 9, 2011 confirmation hearing for the post of Secretary of Defense before the Senate Armed Services Committee.

Nearly two decades ago, defense analysis professor John Arquilla describes “the first global cyberwar, where the enemy is invisible, the battles virtual, and the casualties all too real.” Arquilla’s fictional day-by-day detailed depiction of a three-week-long cyber assault and its precipitating events remains a great read, and with very few exceptions, is just as contemporary today.

Unfortunately, changing forms of internet communication are quickly outpacing laws and technology designed to allow for the lawful intercept of communication content.”\nLaw Professor Peter Swire reports that the Review Group, having full awareness of concerns about the “going dark” controversy, “sharply criticized any attempt to introduce vulnerabilities into commercially available products and services, and found that even temporary vulnerabilities should be authorized only after administration-wide scrutiny.” Moreover, based on\n *Id.*\n FBI Executives: Director James Comey, FBI, https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/fbi-executives.\n *Going Dark: Encryption, Tech., and the Balance Between Pub.

Rogers observes:\nI liken our historical moment to the situation that confronted the U.S. early in the Cold War, when it became obvious that the Soviet Union and others could build hydrogen bombs and the superpower competition showed worrying signs of instability. We rapidly learned that we needed a nuclear force that was deployed across the three legs of the triad and underpinned by robust command and control mechanisms, far-reaching intelligence, and policy structures including a declared deterrence posture. Building these nuclear forces and the policy and support structures around them took time and did not cause a nuclear war or make the world less safe. On the contrary, it made deterrence predictable, helped to lower tensions, and ultimately facilitated arms control negotiations. While the analogy to cyberspace is not exact, it seems clear that our\n Richard A. Clarke, Michael J. Stone, Cass R.

Just as we fashioned a formidable nuclear capability that served us through the Cold War and beyond, I am confident in our ability to keep pace with adversaries who are determined to control “their” corners of cyberspace, to exfiltrate our intellectual property, and to disrupt the functioning of our institutions. They are every bit as determined, creative, and persistent in these efforts as the Soviet leaders we contained during the Cold War, and unfortunately we see few hints they will act more responsibly in cyberspace. Thus we must commit to the long-term goal of building a truly open, secure cyberspace governed collaboratively by many stakeholders, while we remain prepared for crises and contingencies that can arise along the way—just as we do in every other domain.\nBy the end of 2015, Harvard’s Jessica Stein observes, “[l]ooking forward, cyberterrorism and cyberwar will likely pose a more serious threat to Americans’ well-being than conventional terrorist violence, and government surveillance is and will remain an essential weapon against cyberattacks.”\nDuring early 2016, President Barack Obama, while announcing his new cyber budget provisions and cybersecurity initiatives, stated:\nMy budget includes more than $19 billion for cybersecurity, which is up by more than one-third. And with this plan, we intend to modernize federal IT by replacing and retiring outdated systems that are vulnerable to attack... one of the biggest gaps between the public\n Cyber Operations: Improving the Military Cyber Security Posture in an Uncertain Threat Environment: Hearing Before the Subcomm. on Emerging Threats and Capabilities of the H.

Our Social Security system still runs on a Cobalt platform that dates back to the ‘60s. Our IRS systems are archaic... If we’re going to really secure those in a serious way, then we need to upgrade them . . .\n## More Lessons from History\nJason Healey is a former Director of Cyber Policy during the Obama Administration and cautions that “[c]yber history has been forgotten, ignored as irrelevant, or intentionally falsified . . . [while] the issues faced today are largely reflected in, or are exactly the same as, those faced by the previous generation.” Today, recruiting skilled talent to defend against cyber attack remains a challenge. However, as Mr. Healey observes about cyber defenders,\nAs each new wave of entrants, every five years or so, feels that they are the pioneers. Since they are not taught any history of their field, many accordingly fail to distinguish between what is actually new versus what is just new to them. In addition, cyberspace not only has many characteristics which are non-intuitive to (older) policymakers, but it seems to be forever changing... Admittedly, the field is still emerging rapidly, and we are at the beginning of the ‘cyber age.’ But that is no reason to ignore the useful lessons of its current history.\n---\n *Remarks by the President Obama on New Cybersecurity Initiatives* (Feb. 9, 2016), https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/02/09/remarks-president-new-cybersecurity-initiatives (last viewed Apr. 13, 2016); see also *President Obama, Protecting U.S. Innovation from Cyberthreats*, WALL ST.

[And] in the earnest hope that something constructive may be accomplished that will aid our national defense and preclude a repetition of the disaster of December 7, 1941.” As our strategy evolves to detect, mitigate, and fight cyberattacks, reflection upon these principles, and how, if at all, they may differ in today’s rapidly changing technological environment, may prove helpful. The principles are as follows:\n1. Operational and intelligence work requires centralization of authority and clear-cut allocation of responsibility.\n2. Supervisory officials cannot safely take anything for granted in the alerting of subordinates.\n3. Any doubt as to whether outposts should be given information should always be resolved in favor of supplying the information.\n4. The delegation of authority or the issuance of orders entails the duty of inspection to determine that the official mandate is properly exercised.\n5. The implementation of official orders must be followed with closest supervision.\n6. The maintenance of alertness to responsibility must be insured through repetition.\n---\n S. Rep.

Complacency and procrastination are out of place where sudden and decisive action are of the essence.\n8. The coordination and proper evaluation of intelligence in times of stress must be insured by continuity of service and centralization of responsibility in competent officials.\n9. The unapproachable or superior attitude of officials is fatal. There should never be any hesitancy in asking for clarification of instructions or in seeking advice on matters that are in doubt.\n10. There is no substitute for imagination and resourcefulness on the part of supervisory and intelligence officials.\n11. Communications must be characterized by clarity, forthrightness, and appropriateness.\n12. There is great danger in careless paraphrase of information received and every effort should be made to insure that the paraphrased material reflects the true meaning of the original.\n13. Procedures must be sufficiently flexible to meet the exigencies of unusual situations.\n14. Restrictions of highly confidential information to a minimum number of officials, while often necessary, should not be carried to the point of prejudicing the work of the organization.\n15. There is great danger of being blinded by the self-evident.\n16. Officials should at all times give subordinates the benefit of significant information.\n17. An official who neglects to familiarize himself in detail with his organization should forfeit his responsibility.\n18. Failure can be avoided in the long run only by preparation for any eventuality.\n19. Officials, on a personal basis, should never countermand an official instruction.\n\n[VOL. 18: 233]\n20. Personal or official jealousy will wreck any organization.\n21. Personal friendship, without more, should never be accepted in lieu of liaison or confused therewith where the latter is necessary to the proper functioning of two or more agencies.\n22. No considerations should be permitted as an excuse for failure to perform a fundamental task.\n23. Superiors must at all times keep their subordinates adequately informed and, conversely, subordinates should keep their superiors informed.\n24. The administrative organization of any establishment must be designed to locate failures and to assess responsibility.\n25. In a well-balanced organization there is close correlation of responsibility and authority.\nA major difference between the environment surrounding Pearl Harbor and the cyber domain, according to Harvard National Security Fellow Steven Anderson, “is the fact that the military owns less than 15% of the cyberspace environment . . . so integration between the military/public/private sectors is absolutely critical if the nation is going to prevent an event as depicted earlier in this paper . . . let alone how to respond if/when it does occur.”\n## VII.

Now, just as in the days and weeks immediately preceding the 1941 attack against the United States at Pearl Harbor, all the necessary warning signs are there. Enemies have probed and fully mapped the data systems of America’s important corporations and institutions. The future of the United States, represented by its intellectual property, has systematically been stolen by its adversaries. Initial sounding of the alarm, “the hackers are coming; the hackers are coming” may have already faded from deaf ears. However, beware, the hackers are here!

It’s a Tuesday morning in February. Without fanfare or warning, Americans awake to find that nothing works. In Wellesley, Massachusetts, sixth graders at Horatio H. Hunnewell Elementary School on Cameron Street awoke later than usual because alarm clocks failed to provide their normal wake-up call. Meanwhile, just a few miles away in South Boston, the fire fighters of Engine Company 39, Ladder 18 receive delayed notice of homes ablaze because the phone system is down. First responders arrive at their destinations later than normal because traffic lights are not functioning. Everywhere this morning, fire fighters are busy dealing with fires, hamstrung because fire hydrants are not operational due to electrical outages that cause pumps to fail. Those individuals reliant on electrical medical devices are struggling, and confusion is widespread.\nThis Tuesday morning, the electrical grids in the eastern and western United States fail.⁶ As a result, all states except for Texas, Alaska and Hawaii (which have their own grids) are without power. The government declares a state of emergency and promises to locate the problem and restore services as soon as possible. Emergency generators provide power for some essential services such as hospitals and public broadcasters. However, schools are closed, and public transportation proves intermittent at best. Inoperable traffic signals cause automobile travel to slow to a snail’s pace in major cities. Phone landlines are down for most businesses. Cell towers don’t work because of power loss. Some people use this “holiday” from work and school to venture out for necessities.

But this morning, no spinach &amp; feta omelets are served. Like Florida, southern Texas and Arizona, the West Coast—particularly southern California—benefits from a climate that is hospitable even during February. At the macro level, widespread losses of electrical power result in store closures and quicker defrost and spoilage of existing grocery store foodstuffs. The inability to pump gas at most service stations quickly results in long lines of cars waiting to fuel at the few open gas stations (before resupply trucks fail to make deliveries). Abandoned cars left on streets and highways soon become a major problem for the already congested Los Angeles area.\nIn northern California, Sandhill Road in Menlo Park, just a few minutes from Stanford University, is “ground zero” for America’s venture capital industry. This morning, many pillars of venture finance find themselves locked out of their offices when front door electronic security devices fail to operate. Classes are cancelled at Stanford, and lunch will not be served today along Fisherman’s Wharf in San Francisco.\nEven during February, the impact of global warming and wildfires prove to be problematic this year in the western United States.

Frightened people quickly resort to desperate measures.\nFor California, as in most of the United States, most component parts of the electrical grid are now many decades old. Critically important for transferring electrical power between circuits, large power transformers average forty years old, with many in operation for an excess of seventy years.¹³ After power failures from disasters such as Hurricane Sandy on the U.S. east coast, the grid’s “reliability, effectiveness, and affordability are increasingly being brought into question.”¹⁴ However, not enough was done to fix the grid.\n## National Capital Area\nThis morning, breakfast is not available at the Hay Adams Hotel across from the White House.

This submarine fiber optic network is “the physical infrastructure that underpins the virtual cloud of cyberspace.”²⁰ Since its advent in 1977, the fiber optic cable system has experienced rampant growth. Thomas Friedman observes, “around the year 2000 we entered a whole new era, Globalization 3.0 . . . [which brings] the newfound power for individuals to collaborate and compete globally.”²¹ Friedman contends this development allows rapid circulation of digital content at almost no cost, thus creating global collaboration. Therefore, “[g]lobalization 3.0 is going to be more and more driven not only by individuals but also by a much more diverse—non-western, non white—group of individuals. Individuals from every corner of the flat world are being empowered.”²²\n---\n¹⁷ *Contact Us*, NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY, https://www.nsa.gov/about/contact-us/ (last visited Nov. 17, 2016).\n¹⁸ *Contact CIA*, CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY, https://www.cia.gov/index.html# (last visited Nov. 17, 2016).\n¹⁹ Barbara Maranzani, 9 *Things You May Not Know About the Pentagon*, HISTORY.COM (Jan. 15, 2013), http://www.history.com/news/9-things-you-may-not-know-about-the-pentagon.\n²⁰ Tara Davenport, *Submarine Cables, Cybersecurity and International Law: An Intersectional Analysis*, 24 CATH.

Almost overnight, money has no meaning; bartering replaces currency for transactions, and the American economy grinds to a halt. Banks are closed, and ATM machines fail to operate.\nDown on Wall Street, although emergency backup systems are capable of trading securities, orders to buy or sell are not received in New York, as Boston area brokerage offices lack telephone service and have no ability to communicate. Commerce ceases nationwide as the power grid continues to stay down. Backup systems powered by fossil fuels soon deplete their supplies of coal, gas, diesel, kerosene, *et cetera*. Much like the great blizzard of 2015, snow is piled up everywhere.²⁶ Schools have not reopened since Zero Day. Public transportation remains closed. After several days, snow removal is finally abandoned for lack of fuel and because workers choose to be at home with their families.\n²³ Davenport, *supra* note 20, at 62 (citing G.A.

But this time, things are different.\nIt’s been almost ten days now since electricity went out across forty-seven states. For a while, hospitals are okay with their backup power sources. Within a week or so, many start to run out of fuel to power their generators. At first, elective surgeries are postponed. Several days later as power becomes increasingly scarce, medical monitoring machines fail and lab testing stops. Doctors, nurses, and other healthcare workers cannot make their way between home and work. By now, most hospitals are desperately understaffed, without fuel or other sources of functioning power. Many hospitals simply fail and services stop, with no place to send their patients. The sick start to die and bodies pile up. Without electricity, gas stations cannot pump gas, streetlights and traffic signals are dark, and those who can make it through the snow soon empty grocery stores of all remaining usable food.\nAt sub-freezing temperatures; humans and their habitats are in peril. As buildings shed their heat, staying warm becomes a challenge. The elderly and the very young succumb first. After the first few days, finding fire for warmth becomes difficult and causes panic. After firewood supplies are consumed, all things paper, and even fine furniture, are burned for warmth. Staying warm in large cities proves particularly challenging. The silent killer of carbon monoxide poisoning leads to accidental deaths.²⁷\nWhen elevators fail to work, having navigated many flights of stairs in the dark to get home, many of those living in apartment buildings stay inside. It takes days for emergency workers to rescue those caught in stalled elevators when the power failed. Fire becomes an unchecked inferno, as desperate city dwellers create fires from anything that will burn. In the absence of vital emergency services, these fires inevitably become uncontrollable. First buildings, then entire neighborhoods, burn out of control.\n²⁷ April Kahn, *What Is Carbon Monoxide Poisoning?*, HEALTHLINE (Dec. 1 2015), http://www.healthline.com/health/carbon-monoxide-poisoning#Overview1.\n244\nN.C. J.L. &amp; TECH.\n[VOL. 18: 233]\nWith transportation halted, after a week or so hunger forces many to go into the cold in search of something to eat.\n## The Midwest in February\nThe weather in Chicago is almost always horrible in February.²⁸ This year is no different. Many resourceful residents in Evanston and the more affluent suburbs use their gas fireplaces for cooking. However, this proves to be much easier to do in theory than in practice. Before long, cooking grease results in fires and dangerous and painful burns. Similar human misery is found throughout the mid-west as cities like Detroit, Cleveland, Columbus and St. Louis quickly stall to a frozen halt.\n## In the South\nThose in warmer climates find survival moderately easier. In rural areas, crops and livestock provide sustenance. Many revert to those survival skills typical of life on the prairie two hundred years earlier. Even worse than the gas lines of the 1970s, service station fuel pumps fail for lack of electrical power, and transportation soon stops as cars are rendered useless due to lack of fuel. Railroad and truck food distribution systems in the South also fail, and the population soon grows hungry. Hunting and fishing moves from being a hobby to a necessity, and survival gains a renewed importance in daily life. Particularly in densely populated areas, household pets soon disappear, along with the residents of many local zoos. Animal shelters everywhere are no longer needed. Easy availability of firearms results in a rapid shift of vital resources between the “haves” and “have nots.”\nAs the homeless have known for years, survival in warmer climates, such as in Florida, is easier during the winter. Unlike the frozen northeast, it is actually possible to sleep outdoors during the winter. As a result, many families in the northern parts of the United States, having abandoned all their belongings, once their\n²⁸ Christian Farr, *Record-Breaking Cold Air Grips Chicago*, NBC CHICAGO 5 (Feb. 19, 2015), http://www.nbcchicago.com/weather/stories/chicago-weather-record-cold-thursday-february-18-292218691.html.\nDEC 2016] Is Cyberattack the Next Pearl Harbor? 245\ngas runs out now find themselves stranded in their cars somewhere between home and their southern destinations.\n## The Importance of Water\nAs those in the western part of the United States have known for years, water scarcity is a life or death issue. Messrs.

Our systems, from water treatment to hospitals to traffic control to all [those] things that we expect every day, our ability to operate without electricity is minimal.”³⁶ The availability of water is a major priority at all times, particularly during a disruptive crisis such as a cyberattack. According to Fugate,\nThat means we need to have enough power to pump, treat, and distribute water through the system. You have to keep the water system up, and you’ve gotta [sic] then focus on the water treatment system. Backing up sewage is just about as bad. Those two pieces will buy you enough time to look at what your alternatives are. Basically, people have to drink water, they have to eat, that waste has to go somewhere, they need medical care, they need a safe environment. There has to be order of law there.³⁷\nThe nation’s water supply presents numerous vulnerabilities.

In 1937, building on the work of great American cryptanalysts such as Herbert O. Yardley, Laurance F. Safford, Agnes Meyer Driscoll, William F. Friedman, Frank B. Rowlett, Genevieve Grotjan, and many others, relevant “solutions of intercepted foreign messages began flowing to the White House.”⁵²\nPeter Kross writes that “[i]n 1941, William Friedman had broken the Japanese cryptosystem called Purple, which allowed this country to read all the diplomatic traffic coming from Tokyo to its outposts around the world.”⁵³ David Kahn writes that “[b]y late 1941 solutions . . . soared to 50 to 75 messages a day . . .

Tokyo to the ambassador in Washington declared: There is more reason than ever before for us to arm ourselves to the teeth for all-out war.”⁵⁴ Moreover,\nIn the first week of December, 1941, the U.S. learned that the Japanese government gave instructions to its Washington embassy to start destroying its codes, a clear sign that diplomatic relations were about to be broken. On December 6 through 7, U.S. code breakers intercepted a 14-part message, the so-called ‘War Warning,’ which ended with orders to break off any further talks with the Americans at precisely 1:00 p.m. Washington time (7:30 a.m. Hawaii time) on December 7.⁵⁵\nAmerican code-breaker and mathematics teacher Frank Rowlett observes, “As I look back at all the messages and other information available to us . . . it becomes crystal clear to me that this message ordering the destruction of certain of Washington’s codes provided the necessary evidence . . . which would make war between the United States and Japan a certainty.”⁵⁶ Pearl Harbor had not been protected. As Kahn writes, “Japan had sealed all possible leaks. The ambassadors in Washington were not told of the attacks. Knowledge of it was limited in Toyko to as tight a circle as possible . . . No reference to a raid on Pearl Harbor ever went on the air, even coded.”⁵⁷ In a tragedy of errors, “[d]isorganization and divided responsibility had cost America dearly.”⁵⁸ It had taken fifteen and a half hours after message No.\n⁵⁴ See Kahn, supra note 52.\n⁵⁵ KROSS, supra note 53, at 269.; see also FRED B.

Therefore, the knowledge most U.S. citizens have about Pearl Harbor comes from history books and may seem increasingly remote as the years pass. For many families, the oral histories passed down by parents and grandparents are how many contemporary Americans remember and learn about Pearl Harbor. Michael McCaul, Chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, recalls, “My dad’s mission—the mission that millions of other young Americans joined after the attack on Pearl Harbor—was to help roll back the threat posed by a radical\n⁵⁹ *Id.* at 61.\n⁶⁰ S.

Tactical information victories, such as the information skirmishes that preceded the Battle of Midway, highlighted the increasing interaction of advanced communications technologies with strategic deception tactics for operational advantage.”⁶⁷ As Professor Chris Bronk observes, “[h]ow states behave with regard to the Internet appears to matter more and more within international affairs . . . [and] Internet conflict may be a new area of international behavior falling somewhere between diplomacy and military action.”⁶⁸\nWhile a detailed discussion of the law of cyberwar is beyond the scope of this paper, any threshold inquiry must start with the question, “What exactly constitutes ‘warfare?’” According to Nineteenth century military theorist Carl von Clausewitz, an act of war requires that aggressive or defensive conduct be (1) “violent or potentially violent, (2) “instrumental: [where] physical violence or the threat of force is a means to compel the enemy to accept the attacker’s will,” and (3) “attributable to one side at some point\n⁶⁴ MICHAEL MCCAUL, FAILURES OF IMAGINATION: THE DEADLIEST THREATS TO OUR HOMELAND—AND HOW TO THWART THEM 5 (New York: Crown Forum 2016).\n⁶⁵ GEORGE SANTAYANA, THE LIFE OF REASON OR THE PHASES OF PROGRESS 284 (Charles Scribner’s Sons 1905).\n⁶⁶ See JULIE RYAN, LEADING ISSUES IN INFORMATION WARFARE AND SECURITY RESEARCH vii (ACPI, 2015).\n⁶⁷ Id.\n⁶⁸ See Christopher Bronk, Blown to Bits: China’s War in Cyberspace, August-September 2020, 5 STRAT.

Actions online affect actions offline, and vice versa. Thus, far from being separate from conventional war, as Rid [contends], cyberwar is deeply embedded in contemporary military practices.”⁷¹ Moreover, “[c]yberwar, in fact, is part of the evolution of conventional warfare, which itself is linked to broader social and political change . . .”⁷²\nIn addition to causing physical injury or death, violence can refer to mental abuse and different forms of deprivation. The academic discipline of peace studies has for decades advanced the concept of structural violence, such as racism and sexism. In its widest sense, then, violence can be found in almost any coercive situation. And the various attacks and activities associated with cyberwar, from stealing data to disrupting other governments’ computer systems, clearly fall within this broad category.⁷³\nThis debate, carried out in the pages of *Foreign Affairs*,⁷⁴ includes Thomas Rid’s concurrence that cyberspace activities are indeed “an inherent part of conventional warfare . . .

Hayden\nFormer Director of the National Security Agency and CIA76\nSinger and Friedman believe that “[d]efining cyberwar need not be so complicated. The key elements of war in cyberspace all have their parallels and connections to warfare in other domains . . . war always has a political goal and mode (which distinguishes it from crime) and always has an element of violence.”77 For example, “the US government’s position is that to meet this definition of the use of force, a cyberattack would have to ‘proximately result in death, injury or significant destruction.’ That is, even if conducted through cyber means, the effect must be physical damage or destruction.”78\nHouse Homeland Security Chairman Michael McCaul reflected on the 9/11 Commission’s “lack of readiness;” finding, where\n75 See Thomas Rid, *Is Cyberwar Real?: Gauging the Threats/Rid Replies*, FOREIGN AFF., Mar.–Apr. 2014, at 167.

For example,\nIn 2007, U.S. soldiers took smartphone photos of a group of new U.S. Army helicopters parked at a base in Iraq and then uploaded them to the Internet. The helicopters weren't classified and the photos showed no seemingly useful information to the enemy. But the soldiers didn't realize the photos also included \"geotags,\" which revealed where the photographers had been standing. Insurgents then used these geotags to pinpoint and destroy four of the helicopters in a mortar attack. Experts now use this example to warn people to be more careful about what they share when engaged in an important activity.⁸¹\n## Warnings Abound\nDespite the repeated warnings from arguably the best and brightest among us, actual action has proved too little too late. Congress finally passed five major pieces of cybersecurity legislation during December 2014, the first cybersecurity laws enacted in more than a decade.⁸² By the time the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign was underway, and following the late 2015 terrorist strikes in Paris, San Bernardino, and Brussels, national security and cyber vulnerability had become topics of major concern to the American public.⁸³ Dean and law professor Jon M.

Coupled with Internet adoption patterns, we are witnessing a dramatic shift in the size, complexity, and diversity of cyber security attacks.”¹⁰³ Before Congress, Kurose testified that the United States:\nNeeds to continue its investments in game-changing research if our cyber systems are to be trustworthy now and in the future. As you know, every day, we learn about more sophisticated and dangerous attacks. Why is the cyber security challenge so hard? The general answer is that attacks and defenses co-evolve: a system that was secure yesterday might no longer be secure tomorrow. More specific responses to this question include:\n- The technology base of our critical infrastructure systems is frequently updated to improve functionality, availability, and/or performance. New systems introduce new vulnerabilities (unknowable in the lab) that need new defenses when put into practice.\n- The environments in which our computing systems are rapidly developed and deployed, and the functionality that they provide are also not static. With entirely new computing models/platforms, like cloud and mobile computing, come new content and function, which in turn create new opportunities and incentives for attack and disruption.\n- As the automation of complex system interdependencies comes to pervade our critical infrastructure, new kinds of cascading vulnerabilities can be accidentally created and subsequently discovered in these systems, including the electric power grid, automated transportation networks, and robotic medical systems.\n- The sophistication of attackers is increasing as well as their sheer number and the specificity of their targets.\n- As information and systems are increasingly connected, and are increasingly composed of software and hardware\n¹⁰³ *Id.*\nDEC 2016] Is Cyberattack the Next Pearl Harbor?\n263\nproduced by global supply chains, the opportunities for malicious insiders to cause damage increases, and the risks of information leaks multiply.\n- As more systems and data become accessible, information that was once low risk becomes high risk through correlation that was unimaginable only a few years ago.\n- Achieving system trustworthiness is not purely a technology problem. System developers, purchasers, operators and users all have a role to play in system security, and ways to incentivize positive behaviors are required. Security mechanisms that are not convenient will be circumvented; security mechanisms that are difficult to understand will be ignored or misinterpreted. Indeed, cyber security is a multi-dimensional challenge, requiring expertise in computer science, mathematics, economics, behavioral sciences, and education.¹⁰⁴\nIn Congressional testimony given on March 4, 2015, Navy Admiral Michael S. Rogers, commander of the U.S. Cyber Command and director of the National Security Agency, stated:\nEvery conflict in the world today has a cyber dimension ... The most worrisome of these campaigns are state-sponsored, persistent, and worldwide in scope. They are aimed at governments, non-profits, and corporations wherever they might be accruing intellectual capital that the attackers believe could be valuable, whether for re-sale or passage to competing firms and industries ... We see states developing capabilities and attaining accesses for potential hostilities, perhaps with the idea of enhancing deterrence or as a beachhead for future cyber sabotage. Private security researchers over the last year have reported on numerous malware finds in the industrial control systems of energy sector organizations ... We believe potential adversaries might be leaving cyber fingerprints on our critical infrastructure partly to convey a message that\n¹⁰⁴ *Id.*\n264\nN.C.J.L. &amp; TECH.\n[VOL. 18: 233\nour homeland is at risk if tensions ever escalate toward military conflict.¹⁰⁵\nTime and time again, specific warnings have been presented to Congress about what needs to be done by government and private organizations to increase their cybersecurity defenses. Secretary of Defense Ash Carter cautioned, “The same Internet that enables Wikipedia also allows terrorists to learn how to build a bomb. And the same technologies we use to target cruise missiles and jam enemy air defenses can be used against our own forces—and they’re now available to the highest bidder.”¹⁰⁶ Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Navy Admiral James A. Winnefeld, Jr. said, “Today, 96 percent of our most advanced electronic warfare systems are assembled with commercially available components. We only add 4 percent worth of ‘special sauce.’¹⁰⁷ That means adversaries can quickly copy advanced U.S. systems with globally sourced components.”¹⁰⁸ Ash Carter warned that “[w]hether it’s in the cloud, infrared cameras, or the GPS signals that provide navigation for ride-sharing apps, but also for aircraft carriers and our smart bombs—our reliance on technology has led to real vulnerabilities that our adversaries are eager to exploit.”¹⁰⁹\nSecretary of Defense, Ash Carter, explains nation-states, terrorist, and criminal networks are “increasing their cyber operations. Low-cost and global proliferation of malware have lowered barriers to entry and made it easier for smaller malicious actors to strike in cyberspace. We’re also seeing blended state-and-non-state threats in cyber … which complicates potential\n¹⁰⁵ Cyber Operations: Improving the Military Cybersecurity Posture in an Uncertain Threat Environment: Hearing Before the Subcomm. on Emerging Threats &amp; Capabilities of the H.

Nearly two decades ago, defense analysis professor John Arquilla describes “the first global cyberwar, where the enemy is invisible, the battles virtual, and the casualties all too real.”¹¹⁵ Arquilla’s fictional day-by-day detailed depiction of a three-week-long cyber assault and its precipitating events remains a great read, and with very few exceptions, is just as contemporary today. In 2012, Mike McConnell, former director of national intelligence during President George W. Bush’s administration, warned, “the United States could not ‘wait for the cyber equivalent of the World Trade Centers.’”¹¹⁶\nThe USA PATRIOT Act¹¹⁷ defines *critical infrastructure* as “systems and assets, physical or virtual, so vital to the United States that the incapacity or destruction of such systems and assets would have a debilitating impact on security, national economic security, national public health and safety, or any combination of those matters.”¹¹⁸ Presidential Decision Directive 63 (or PDD-63)\n---\n¹¹⁴ Siobhan Gorman &amp; Julian E.

FBI Director James B. Comey¹²⁴ describes the controversial problem known as “going dark” to the Senate Judiciary Committee as “the growing challenges to public safety and national security that have eroded our ability to obtain electronic information and evidence pursuant to a court order or warrant.”¹²⁵ In testimony given to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, Director Comey observes that we “live in a technologically driven society and just as private industry has adapted to modern forms of communication so too have the terrorists. Unfortunately, changing forms of internet communication are quickly outpacing laws and technology designed to allow for the lawful intercept of communication content.”¹²⁶\nLaw Professor Peter Swire reports that the Review Group, having full awareness of concerns about the “going dark” controversy, “sharply criticized any attempt to introduce vulnerabilities into commercially available products and services, and found that even temporary vulnerabilities should be authorized only after administration-wide scrutiny.”¹²⁷ Moreover, based on\n¹²³ *Id.*\n¹²⁴ FBI Executives: Director James Comey, FBI, https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/fbi-executives.\n¹²⁵ *Going Dark: Encryption, Tech., and the Balance Between Pub.

We rapidly learned that we needed a nuclear force that was deployed across the three legs of the triad and underpinned by robust command and control mechanisms, far-reaching intelligence, and policy structures including a declared deterrence posture. Building these nuclear forces and the policy and support structures around them took time and did not cause a nuclear war or make the world less safe. On the contrary, it made deterrence predictable, helped to lower tensions, and ultimately facilitated arms control negotiations.

Just as we fashioned a formidable nuclear capability that served us through the Cold War and beyond, I am confident in our ability to keep pace with adversaries who are determined to control “their” corners of cyberspace, to exfiltrate our intellectual property, and to disrupt the functioning of our institutions. They are every bit as determined, creative, and persistent in these efforts as the Soviet leaders we contained during the Cold War, and unfortunately we see few hints they will act more responsibly in cyberspace. Thus we must commit to the long-term goal of building a truly open, secure cyberspace governed collaboratively by many stakeholders, while we remain prepared for crises and contingencies that can arise along the way—just as we do in every other domain.¹⁸³\nBy the end of 2015, Harvard’s Jessica Stein observes, “[l]ooking forward, cyberterrorism and cyberwar will likely pose a more serious threat to Americans’ well-being than conventional terrorist violence, and government surveillance is and will remain an essential weapon against cyberattacks.”¹⁸⁴\nDuring early 2016, President Barack Obama, while announcing his new cyber budget provisions and cybersecurity initiatives, stated:\nMy budget includes more than $19 billion for cybersecurity, which is up by more than one-third.

[while] the issues faced today are largely reflected in, or are exactly the same as, those faced by the previous generation.”¹⁸⁶ Today, recruiting skilled talent to defend against cyber attack remains a challenge.¹⁸⁷ However, as Mr. Healey observes about cyber defenders,\nAs each new wave of entrants, every five years or so, feels that they are the pioneers. Since they are not taught any history of their field, many accordingly fail to distinguish between what is actually new versus what is just new to them. In addition, cyberspace not only has many characteristics which are non-intuitive to (older) policymakers, but it seems to be forever changing... Admittedly, the field is still emerging rapidly, and we are at the beginning of the ‘cyber age.’ But that is no reason to ignore the useful lessons of its current history.¹⁸⁸\n---\n¹⁸⁵ *Remarks by the President Obama on New Cybersecurity Initiatives* (Feb. 9, 2016), https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/02/09/remarks-president-new-cybersecurity-initiatives (last viewed Apr. 13, 2016); see also *President Obama, Protecting U.S. Innovation from Cyberthreats*, WALL ST.

[And] in the earnest hope that something constructive may be accomplished that will aid our national defense and preclude a repetition of the disaster of December 7, 1941.”¹⁹⁰ As our strategy evolves to detect, mitigate, and fight cyberattacks, reflection upon these principles, and how, if at all, they may differ in today’s rapidly changing technological environment, may prove helpful. The principles are as follows:\n1. Operational and intelligence work requires centralization of authority and clear-cut allocation of responsibility.\n2. Supervisory officials cannot safely take anything for granted in the alerting of subordinates.\n3. Any doubt as to whether outposts should be given information should always be resolved in favor of supplying the information.\n4. The delegation of authority or the issuance of orders entails the duty of inspection to determine that the official mandate is properly exercised.\n5.

Complacency and procrastination are out of place where sudden and decisive action are of the essence.\n8. The coordination and proper evaluation of intelligence in times of stress must be insured by continuity of service and centralization of responsibility in competent officials.\n9.

There is no substitute for imagination and resourcefulness on the part of supervisory and intelligence officials.\n11. Communications must be characterized by clarity, forthrightness, and appropriateness.\n12.

Now, just as in the days and weeks immediately preceding the 1941 attack against the United States at Pearl Harbor, all the necessary warning signs are there. Enemies have probed and fully mapped the data systems of America’s important corporations and institutions. The future of the United States, represented by its intellectual property, has systematically been stolen by its adversaries. Initial sounding of the alarm, “the hackers are coming; the hackers are coming” may have already faded from deaf ears. However, beware, the hackers are here! The hackers are here!\n^{}[]\n# NORTH CAROLINA JOURNAL OF LAW &amp; TECHNOLOGY\n## VOLUME 18, ISSUE 3\nMARCH 2017\nPublished by:\n|  NC.

Second, for historical perspective, the December 7, 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor is presented. Third is a review of contemporary and credible warnings. Fourth is a discussion about the privacy versus national security debate, and geopolitical developments that might determine how a cyber drama is played-out on the world stage. Fifth, the question of what is to be done is addressed. Next, the 1946 Congressional Joint Committee on the Investigation of the Pearl Harbor Attack’s recommended principles (designed to prevent the repetition of such a future attack) is reviewed with our contemporary environment in mind.\n## II.

It’s a Tuesday morning in February. Without fanfare or warning, Americans awake to find that nothing works. In Wellesley, Massachusetts, sixth graders at Horatio H. Hunnewell Elementary School on Cameron Street awoke later than usual because alarm clocks failed to provide their normal wake-up call. Meanwhile, just a few miles away in South Boston, the fire fighters of Engine Company 39, Ladder 18 receive delayed notice of homes ablaze because the phone system is down. First responders arrive at their destinations later than normal because traffic lights are not functioning. Everywhere this morning, fire fighters are busy dealing with fires, hamstrung because fire hydrants are not operational due to electrical outages that cause pumps to fail. Those individuals reliant on electrical medical devices are struggling, and confusion is widespread.\nThis Tuesday morning, the electrical grids in the eastern and western United States fail.⁶ As a result, all states except for Texas, Alaska and Hawaii (which have their own grids) are without power. The government declares a state of emergency and promises to locate the problem and restore services as soon as possible. Emergency generators provide power for some essential services such as hospitals and public broadcasters. However, schools are closed, and public transportation proves intermittent at best. Inoperable traffic signals cause automobile travel to slow to a snail’s pace in major cities. Phone landlines are down for most businesses. Cell towers don’t work because of power loss. Some people use this “holiday” from work and school to venture out for necessities. However, stocked groceries and operating gas stations prove hard to come by since few sources have their own power generators. Most restaurants are unable to open due to lack of electricity and public transportation for their employees.

All originating air travel is cancelled, resulting in the stranding of travelers numbering in the tens of thousands, usually at unfamiliar airports. Even so, just before all aircraft could land, reports of compromised aircraft control systems are reported. Also, within recent memory are the terrorist attacks at Fort Hood,⁸ the Boston Marathon,⁹ Paris,¹⁰ San Bernardino,¹¹ and Brussels.¹² ⁷ See generally Derek Jinks, September 11 and the Laws of War, 28 YALE J.

But this morning, no spinach &amp; feta omelets are served. Like Florida, southern Texas and Arizona, the West Coast—particularly southern California—benefits from a climate that is hospitable even during February. At the macro level, widespread losses of electrical power result in store closures and quicker defrost and spoilage of existing grocery store foodstuffs. The inability to pump gas at most service stations quickly results in long lines of cars waiting to fuel at the few open gas stations (before resupply trucks fail to make deliveries). Abandoned cars left on streets and highways soon become a major problem for the already congested Los Angeles area.\nIn northern California, Sandhill Road in Menlo Park, just a few minutes from Stanford University, is “ground zero” for America’s venture capital industry. This morning, many pillars of venture finance find themselves locked out of their offices when front door electronic security devices fail to operate. Classes are cancelled at Stanford, and lunch will not be served today along Fisherman’s Wharf in San Francisco.\nEven during February, the impact of global warming and wildfires prove to be problematic this year in the western United States. Lack of transportation hinders both first responder emergency services, such as firefighting efforts, and the ability to move agricultural products to heavily populated areas. Widespread Zeckhauser, *Recollection Bias and Its Underpinnings: Lessons from Terrorism-Risk Assessments* (Harvard Kennedy Sch., Working Paper No. 16-003) (2015), http://ssrn.com/abstract=2692253.\n\n[VOL. 18: 233 hunger soon becomes the primary cause of civil unrest and crime. Frightened people quickly resort to desperate measures.\nFor California, as in most of the United States, most component parts of the electrical grid are now many decades old. Critically important for transferring electrical power between circuits, large power transformers average forty years old, with many in operation for an excess of seventy years.¹³ After power failures from disasters such as Hurricane Sandy on the U.S. east coast, the grid’s “reliability, effectiveness, and affordability are increasingly being brought into question.”¹⁴ However, not enough was done to fix the grid.\n## National Capital Area This morning, breakfast is not available at the Hay Adams Hotel across from the White House. Nor were the doors open for business at Busboys and Poets at 2021 14th Street, NW.¹⁵ All the typical tourist attractions like the Smithsonian Museums remain closed, along with public schools.

As any thoughtful cyber warfare strategist might have predicted, an attack on the metropolitan Washington, DC – Baltimore metroplex is a focal point of the hostilities.

This submarine fiber optic network is “the physical infrastructure that underpins the virtual cloud of cyberspace.”²⁰ Since its advent in 1977, the fiber optic cable system has experienced rampant growth. Thomas Friedman observes, “around the year 2000 we entered a whole new era, Globalization 3.0... [which brings] the newfound power for individuals to collaborate and compete globally.”²¹ Friedman contends this development allows rapid circulation of digital content at almost no cost, thus creating global collaboration. Therefore, “[g]lobalization 3.0 is going to be more and more driven not only by individuals but also by a much more diverse—non-western, non white—group of individuals. Individuals from every corner of the flat world are being empowered.”²² --- ¹⁷ *Contact Us*, NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY, https://www.nsa.gov/about/contact-us/ (last visited Nov. 17, 2016).\n¹⁸ *Contact CIA*, CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY, https://www.cia.gov/index.html# (last visited Nov. 17, 2016).\n¹⁹ Barbara Maranzani, 9 *Things You May Not Know About the Pentagon*, HISTORY.COM (Jan. 15, 2013), http://www.history.com/news/9-things-you-may-not-know-about-the-pentagon.\n²⁰ Tara Davenport, *Submarine Cables, Cybersecurity and International Law: An Intersectional Analysis*, 24 CATH.

Almost overnight, money has no meaning; bartering replaces currency for transactions, and the American economy grinds to a halt. Banks are closed, and ATM machines fail to operate.\nDown on Wall Street, although emergency backup systems are capable of trading securities, orders to buy or sell are not received in New York, as Boston area brokerage offices lack telephone service and have no ability to communicate. Commerce ceases nationwide as the power grid continues to stay down. Backup systems powered by fossil fuels soon deplete their supplies of coal, gas, diesel, kerosene, *et cetera*. Much like the great blizzard of 2015, snow is piled up everywhere.²⁶ Schools have not reopened since Zero Day. Public transportation remains closed. After several days, snow removal is finally abandoned for lack of fuel and because workers choose to be at home with their families.\n²³ Davenport, *supra* note 20, at 62 (citing G.A.

But this time, things are different.\nIt’s been almost ten days now since electricity went out across forty-seven states. For a while, hospitals are okay with their backup power sources. Within a week or so, many start to run out of fuel to power their generators. At first, elective surgeries are postponed. Several days later as power becomes increasingly scarce, medical monitoring machines fail and lab testing stops. Doctors, nurses, and other healthcare workers cannot make their way between home and work. By now, most hospitals are desperately understaffed, without fuel or other sources of functioning power. Many hospitals simply fail and services stop, with no place to send their patients. The sick start to die and bodies pile up. Without electricity, gas stations cannot pump gas, streetlights and traffic signals are dark, and those who can make it through the snow soon empty grocery stores of all remaining usable food.\nAt sub-freezing temperatures; humans and their habitats are in peril. As buildings shed their heat, staying warm becomes a challenge. The elderly and the very young succumb first. After the first few days, finding fire for warmth becomes difficult and causes panic. After firewood supplies are consumed, all things paper, and even fine furniture, are burned for warmth. Staying warm in large cities proves particularly challenging. The silent killer of carbon monoxide poisoning leads to accidental deaths.²⁷ When elevators fail to work, having navigated many flights of stairs in the dark to get home, many of those living in apartment buildings stay inside. It takes days for emergency workers to rescue those caught in stalled elevators when the power failed. Fire becomes an unchecked inferno, as desperate city dwellers create fires from anything that will burn. In the absence of vital emergency services, these fires inevitably become uncontrollable. First buildings, then entire neighborhoods, burn out of control.\n²⁷ April Kahn, *What Is Carbon Monoxide Poisoning?*, HEALTHLINE (Dec. 1 2015), http://www.healthline.com/health/carbon-monoxide-poisoning#Overview1.\n\n[VOL. 18: 233] With transportation halted, after a week or so hunger forces many to go into the cold in search of something to eat.\n## The Midwest in February The weather in Chicago is almost always horrible in February.²⁸ This year is no different. Many resourceful residents in Evanston and the more affluent suburbs use their gas fireplaces for cooking. However, this proves to be much easier to do in theory than in practice. Before long, cooking grease results in fires and dangerous and painful burns. Similar human misery is found throughout the mid-west as cities like Detroit, Cleveland, Columbus and St. Louis quickly stall to a frozen halt.\n## In the South Those in warmer climates find survival moderately easier. In rural areas, crops and livestock provide sustenance. Many revert to those survival skills typical of life on the prairie two hundred years earlier. Even worse than the gas lines of the 1970s, service station fuel pumps fail for lack of electrical power, and transportation soon stops as cars are rendered useless due to lack of fuel. Railroad and truck food distribution systems in the South also fail, and the population soon grows hungry. Hunting and fishing moves from being a hobby to a necessity, and survival gains a renewed importance in daily life. Particularly in densely populated areas, household pets soon disappear, along with the residents of many local zoos. Animal shelters everywhere are no longer needed. Easy availability of firearms results in a rapid shift of vital resources between the “haves” and “have nots.”\nAs the homeless have known for years, survival in warmer climates, such as in Florida, is easier during the winter. Unlike the frozen northeast, it is actually possible to sleep outdoors during the winter. As a result, many families in the northern parts of the United States, having abandoned all their belongings, once their ²⁸ Christian Farr, *Record-Breaking Cold Air Grips Chicago*, NBC CHICAGO 5 (Feb. 19, 2015), http://www.nbcchicago.com/weather/stories/chicago-weather-record-cold-thursday-february-18-292218691.html.\nDEC 2016] Is Cyberattack the Next Pearl Harbor? 245 gas runs out now find themselves stranded in their cars somewhere between home and their southern destinations.\n## The Importance of Water As those in the western part of the United States have known for years, water scarcity is a life or death issue. Messrs. Papa, Casper, and Moore state that “[s]upervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems and industrial control systems (ICSs) are widely used to control systems such as water supply systems, wastewater collection and treatment facilities... Unfortunately,... these systems are vulnerable to command injection²⁹ and middle-person attacks.”³⁰ James Fugate, now Administrator of the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA),³¹ developed his emergency management skills while serving as Florida’s State Coordinating Officer³² during eleven federal disasters,³³ including the four major hurricanes impacting Florida in 2004,³⁴ and three more in 2005.³⁵ Fugate observes, “[w]e’re not a country that can ²⁹ See Stephen Papa, William Casper &amp; Tyler Moore, *Securing Wastewater Collection Systems from Accidental and Intentional Harm: A Cost-Benefit Analysis*, 6 INT’L.

Our systems, from water treatment to hospitals to traffic control to all [those] things that we expect every day, our ability to operate without electricity is minimal.”³⁶ The availability of water is a major priority at all times, particularly during a disruptive crisis such as a cyberattack. According to Fugate, That means we need to have enough power to pump, treat, and distribute water through the system. You have to keep the water system up, and you’ve gotta [sic] then focus on the water treatment system. Backing up sewage is just about as bad. Those two pieces will buy you enough time to look at what your alternatives are. Basically, people have to drink water, they have to eat, that waste has to go somewhere, they need medical care, they need a safe environment. There has to be order of law there.³⁷ The nation’s water supply presents numerous vulnerabilities. The control system of a small dam within twenty miles of New York City was reported to have been hacked by Iranian hackers in 2013.³⁸ The DOJ unsealed an indictment during March 2016 charging a defendant who was working on behalf of the Iranian Government to hack into the supervisory control and data acquisition systems of the Rye, New York Bowman Dam, thereby providing the ability to control flow rates and water levels.³⁹ ³⁶ See KOPPEL, supra note 6, at 117.\n³⁷ See id. at 118.\n³⁸ See Danny Yadron, Iranian Hacking Threat Emerges, WALL ST.

[All] 57,000 industrial-control systems,... more than any other country,”⁴⁰ remain vulnerable targets.\n## Communication Systems When the national electrical grids fail, home routers, televisions, most elements of the Internet of Things (“IoT”),⁴¹ and landline telephones become useless. After the relatively few commercial and home generators run out of their fuel sources, batteries for personal computers, iPads, iPhones, and all other hand-held devices soon lack connectivity and the ability to gain battery recharge. While public broadcasting facilities tend to have backup generators, cable television likely does not operate in most homes due to the lack of household electrical power. Car radios soon become the largest source of news and widespread civil-defense-type communication, until the gasoline runs out.\n## International Impact France and Great Britain also experience attacks similar to those aimed at the United States.

In 1937, building on the work of great American cryptanalysts such as Herbert O. Yardley, Laurance F. Safford, Agnes Meyer Driscoll, William F. Friedman, Frank B. Rowlett, Genevieve Grotjan, and many others, relevant “solutions of intercepted foreign messages began flowing to the White House.”⁵² Peter Kross writes that “[i]n 1941, William Friedman had broken the Japanese cryptosystem called Purple, which allowed this country to read all the diplomatic traffic coming from Tokyo to its outposts around the world.”⁵³ David Kahn writes that “[b]y late 1941 solutions... soared to 50 to 75 messages a day...

On December 6 through 7, U.S. code breakers intercepted a 14-part message, the so-called ‘War Warning,’ which ended with orders to break off any further talks with the Americans at precisely 1:00 p.m. Washington time (7:30 a.m. Hawaii time) on December 7.⁵⁵ American code-breaker and mathematics teacher Frank Rowlett observes, “As I look back at all the messages and other information available to us... it becomes crystal clear to me that this message ordering the destruction of certain of Washington’s codes provided the necessary evidence... which would make war between the United States and Japan a certainty.”⁵⁶ Pearl Harbor had not been protected. As Kahn writes, “Japan had sealed all possible leaks. The ambassadors in Washington were not told of the attacks. Knowledge of it was limited in Toyko to as tight a circle as possible... No reference to a raid on Pearl Harbor ever went on the air, even coded.”⁵⁷ In a tragedy of errors, “[d]isorganization and divided responsibility had cost America dearly.”⁵⁸ It had taken fifteen and a half hours after message No.\n⁵⁴ See Kahn, supra note 52.\n⁵⁵ KROSS, supra note 53, at 269.; see also FRED B.

Therefore, the knowledge most U.S. citizens have about Pearl Harbor comes from history books and may seem increasingly remote as the years pass. For many families, the oral histories passed down by parents and grandparents are how many contemporary Americans remember and learn about Pearl Harbor. Michael McCaul, Chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, recalls, “My dad’s mission—the mission that millions of other young Americans joined after the attack on Pearl Harbor—was to help roll back the threat posed by a radical ⁵⁹ *Id.* at 61.\n⁶⁰ S.

Tactical information victories, such as the information skirmishes that preceded the Battle of Midway, highlighted the increasing interaction of advanced communications technologies with strategic deception tactics for operational advantage.”⁶⁷ As Professor Chris Bronk observes, “[h]ow states behave with regard to the Internet appears to matter more and more within international affairs... [and] Internet conflict may be a new area of international behavior falling somewhere between diplomacy and military action.”⁶⁸ While a detailed discussion of the law of cyberwar is beyond the scope of this paper, any threshold inquiry must start with the question, “What exactly constitutes ‘warfare?’” According to Nineteenth century military theorist Carl von Clausewitz, an act of war requires that aggressive or defensive conduct be (1) “violent or potentially violent, (2) “instrumental: [where] physical violence or the threat of force is a means to compel the enemy to accept the attacker’s will,” and (3) “attributable to one side at some point ⁶⁴ MICHAEL MCCAUL, FAILURES OF IMAGINATION: THE DEADLIEST THREATS TO OUR HOMELAND—AND HOW TO THWART THEM 5 (New York: Crown Forum 2016).\n⁶⁵ GEORGE SANTAYANA, THE LIFE OF REASON OR THE PHASES OF PROGRESS 284 (Charles Scribner’s Sons 1905).\n⁶⁶ See JULIE RYAN, LEADING ISSUES IN INFORMATION WARFARE AND SECURITY RESEARCH vii.\n⁶⁷ Id.\n⁶⁸ See Christopher Bronk, Blown to Bits: China’s War in Cyberspace, August-September 2020, 5 STRAT.

Actions online affect actions offline, and vice versa. Thus, far from being separate from conventional war, as Rid [contends], cyberwar is deeply embedded in contemporary military practices.”⁷¹ Moreover, “[c]yberwar, in fact, is part of the evolution of conventional warfare, which itself is linked to broader social and political change...”⁷² In addition to causing physical injury or death, violence can refer to mental abuse and different forms of deprivation. The academic discipline of peace studies has for decades advanced the concept of structural violence, such as racism and sexism. In its widest sense, then, violence can be found in almost any coercive situation. And the various attacks and activities associated with cyberwar, from stealing data to disrupting other governments’ computer systems, clearly fall within this broad category.⁷³ This debate, carried out in the pages of *Foreign Affairs*,⁷⁴ includes Thomas Rid’s concurrence that cyberspace activities are indeed “an inherent part of conventional warfare...

Hayden Former Director of the National Security Agency and CIA76 Singer and Friedman believe that “[d]efining cyberwar need not be so complicated. The key elements of war in cyberspace all have their parallels and connections to warfare in other domains... war always has a political goal and mode (which distinguishes it from crime) and always has an element of violence.”77 For example, “the US government’s position is that to meet this definition of the use of force, a cyberattack would have to ‘proximately result in death, injury or significant destruction.’ That is, even if conducted through cyber means, the effect must be physical damage or destruction.”78 House Homeland Security Chairman Michael McCaul reflected on the 9/11 Commission’s “lack of readiness;” finding, where\n\n[VOL: 18: 233\n\"[t]he most important failure was one of imagination.\"⁷⁹ For those age thirty-five or younger, it may be hard to recognize that widespread availability of the Internet dates back only to the 1990s in the United States.

For example,\nIn 2007, U.S. soldiers took smartphone photos of a group of new U.S. Army helicopters parked at a base in Iraq and then uploaded them to the Internet. The helicopters weren't classified and the photos showed no seemingly useful information to the enemy. But the soldiers didn't realize the photos also included \"geotags,\" which revealed where the photographers had been standing. Insurgents then used these geotags to pinpoint and destroy four of the helicopters in a mortar attack. Experts now use this example to warn people to be more careful about what they share when engaged in an important activity.⁸¹\n## Warnings Abound\nDespite the repeated warnings from arguably the best and brightest among us, actual action has proved too little too late. Congress finally passed five major pieces of cybersecurity legislation during December 2014, the first cybersecurity laws enacted in more than a decade.⁸² By the time the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign was underway, and following the late 2015 terrorist strikes in Paris, San Bernardino, and Brussels, national security and cyber vulnerability had become topics of major concern to the American public.⁸³ Dean and law professor Jon M.

Perhaps the most tangible effect of this terrorist activity is the momentum it provided to enact the Cybersecurity Act of 2015.”85 Observing that “[t]he omnibus $1.1 trillion spending law also includes hundreds of millions of dollars to add cybersecurity for the IRS, EPA, and other agencies,” Dean Garon warns, “[t]he law provides little more than a fig leaf for privacy protection, so only the development of final implementing regulations will determine whether there are meaningful safeguards from the potential abuse of the data sharing provisions to intrude on individual privacy.”86 General Michael V. Hayden, former director of both the National Security Agency (“NSA”) and Central Intelligence Agency (“CIA”) warned during 2011 that [o]ur most pressing need is clear policy, formed by shared consensus, shaped by informed discussion, and created by a common body of knowledge. With no common knowledge, no meaningful discussion, and no consensus... the policy vacuum continues. This will not be easy... it will require courage; but, it is essential and should itself be the subject of intense discussion.87 Commander of U.S. Cyber Command and National Security Agency (“NSA”) Admiral Mike Rogers characterized “cyber attacks as the greatest long-term threat to national security in part DEC 2016] Is Cyberattack the Next Pearl Harbor? 259 because ‘we have yet to come to a broad policy and legal consensus.’”⁸⁸ Also during 2011, Deputy Secretary of Defense William Lynn⁸⁹ stated, “If we can minimize the impact of attacks on our operations and attribute them quickly and definitively, we may be able to change the decision calculus of an attacker.”⁹⁰ According to the Pentagon, the volume of intellectual property stolen annually exceeds the amount of information contained in the Library of Congress.⁹¹ During April 2012, subcommittees of the U.S. House Committee on Homeland Security held hearings on the topic of “Iranian Cyber Threat to the U.S. Homeland.”⁹² On August 8, 2012, John O.

Coupled with Internet adoption patterns, we are witnessing a dramatic shift in the size, complexity, and diversity of cyber security attacks.”¹⁰³ Before Congress, Kurose testified that the United States: Needs to continue its investments in game-changing research if our cyber systems are to be trustworthy now and in the future. As you know, every day, we learn about more sophisticated and dangerous attacks. Why is the cyber security challenge so hard? The general answer is that attacks and defenses co-evolve: a system that was secure yesterday might no longer be secure tomorrow. More specific responses to this question include: - The technology base of our critical infrastructure systems is frequently updated to improve functionality, availability, and/or performance. New systems introduce new vulnerabilities (unknowable in the lab) that need new defenses when put into practice.\n- The environments in which our computing systems are rapidly developed and deployed, and the functionality that they provide are also not static. With entirely new computing models/platforms, like cloud and mobile computing, come new content and function, which in turn create new opportunities and incentives for attack and disruption.\n- As the automation of complex system interdependencies comes to pervade our critical infrastructure, new kinds of cascading vulnerabilities can be accidentally created and subsequently discovered in these systems, including the electric power grid, automated transportation networks, and robotic medical systems.\n- The sophistication of attackers is increasing as well as their sheer number and the specificity of their targets.\n- As information and systems are increasingly connected, and are increasingly composed of software and hardware ¹⁰³ *Id.* DEC 2016] Is Cyberattack the Next Pearl Harbor?\n\n- As more systems and data become accessible, information that was once low risk becomes high risk through correlation that was unimaginable only a few years ago.\n- Achieving system trustworthiness is not purely a technology problem. System developers, purchasers, operators and users all have a role to play in system security, and ways to incentivize positive behaviors are required. Security mechanisms that are not convenient will be circumvented; security mechanisms that are difficult to understand will be ignored or misinterpreted. Indeed, cyber security is a multi-dimensional challenge, requiring expertise in computer science, mathematics, economics, behavioral sciences, and education.¹⁰⁴ In Congressional testimony given on March 4, 2015, Navy Admiral Michael S. Rogers, commander of the U.S. Cyber Command and director of the National Security Agency, stated: Every conflict in the world today has a cyber dimension... The most worrisome of these campaigns are state-sponsored, persistent, and worldwide in scope. They are aimed at governments, non-profits, and corporations wherever they might be accruing intellectual capital that the attackers believe could be valuable, whether for re-sale or passage to competing firms and industries... We see states developing capabilities and attaining accesses for potential hostilities, perhaps with the idea of enhancing deterrence or as a beachhead for future cyber sabotage. Private security researchers over the last year have reported on numerous malware finds in the industrial control systems of energy sector organizations... We believe potential adversaries might be leaving cyber fingerprints on our critical infrastructure partly to convey a message that ¹⁰⁴ *Id.* [VOL. 18: 233 our homeland is at risk if tensions ever escalate toward military conflict.¹⁰⁵ Time and time again, specific warnings have been presented to Congress about what needs to be done by government and private organizations to increase their cybersecurity defenses. Secretary of Defense Ash Carter cautioned, “The same Internet that enables Wikipedia also allows terrorists to learn how to build a bomb. And the same technologies we use to target cruise missiles and jam enemy air defenses can be used against our own forces—and they’re now available to the highest bidder.”¹⁰⁶ Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Navy Admiral James A. Winnefeld, Jr. said, “Today, 96 percent of our most advanced electronic warfare systems are assembled with commercially available components. We only add 4 percent worth of ‘special sauce.’¹⁰⁷ That means adversaries can quickly copy advanced U.S. systems with globally sourced components.”¹⁰⁸ Ash Carter warned that “[w]hether it’s in the cloud, infrared cameras, or the GPS signals that provide navigation for ride-sharing apps, but also for aircraft carriers and our smart bombs—our reliance on technology has led to real vulnerabilities that our adversaries are eager to exploit.”¹⁰⁹ Secretary of Defense, Ash Carter, explains nation-states, terrorist, and criminal networks are “increasing their cyber operations. Low-cost and global proliferation of malware have lowered barriers to entry and made it easier for smaller malicious actors to strike in cyberspace.

FBI Director James B. Comey¹²⁴ describes the controversial problem known as “going dark” to the Senate Judiciary Committee as “the growing challenges to public safety and national security that have eroded our ability to obtain electronic information and evidence pursuant to a court order or warrant.”¹²⁵ In testimony given to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, Director Comey observes that we “live in a technologically driven society and just as private industry has adapted to modern forms of communication so too have the terrorists. Unfortunately, changing forms of internet communication are quickly outpacing laws and technology designed to allow for the lawful intercept of communication content.”¹²⁶ Law Professor Peter Swire reports that the Review Group, having full awareness of concerns about the “going dark” controversy, “sharply criticized any attempt to introduce vulnerabilities into commercially available products and services, and found that even temporary vulnerabilities should be authorized only after administration-wide scrutiny.”¹²⁷ Moreover, based on ¹²³ *Id.* ¹²⁴ FBI Executives: Director James Comey, FBI, https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/fbi-executives.\n¹²⁵ *Going Dark: Encryption, Tech., and the Balance Between Pub.

The small can act very big today and pose a serious danger to world order—without the instruments of a state.”¹⁷¹ ## Encryption and the “Least Trusted Country” Problem Stewart A. Baker and Nathan A.

If one party... uses compromised encryption as required in that country, then those globally who communicate with that country will have their communications compromised as well.”¹⁷³ This vulnerability is a particular problem because of lax data security in many other parts of the world where U.S.-generated data traffic either passes through or is destined. The significant growth in either the development or maintenance of computer code via business process outsourcing (“BPO”) by American companies to businesses located in such countries as India may be a critical weakness leading up to a cyber Pearl Harbor.¹⁷⁴ ## VI. WHAT IS TO BE DONE?\n“Terrorists will almost certainly continue to benefit... from a new generation of recruits proficient in information technology, social media, and online research. Some terrorists will look to use these technologies to increase the speed of their communications, the availability of their propaganda, and ability to collaborate with new partners. They will easily take advantage of widely available, free encryption technology, mobile-messaging applications, the dark web, and virtual environments to pursue their objectives.”\nHon. James R.

Does it matter if these acts are carried out by nations, corporations, ad hoc groups, or individuals? [A]re the asymmetries associated with information warfare so great that unleashing the potential might in fact redraft the geopolitical landscape?”¹⁷⁶ Despite whether their policies toward the Internet are characterized as “open or closed,” governments worldwide continue to face “inherent perpetual difficulty in regulating online spaces.”¹⁷⁷ Melissa Hathaway, Chris Demchak, Jason Kerben, Jennifer McArdle and Francesca Spidalieri observe that: A sound National Cyber Security Strategy... must be actionable. Today, the prime topics reflected in most strategies include: outlining organizational and positional authority within the government; fostering awareness and education among citizens; building an incident and crisis management response capability; expanding law enforcement’s capacity to deal with the rate of cyber crimes; facilitating private-public partnerships and developing trusted information sharing exchanges; and NAL.pdf (statement of Hon.

Ryan observe “[m]ost corporations would no more consider the need to develop, and pay for, the technologies, practices and procedures that would be needed to defend against a state-sponsored INFOWAR attack than they would develop the technologies, practices and procedures to protect themselves against a strategic exchange of thermonuclear weapons.”¹⁷⁹ Robert Faris and Rebekah Heacock Jones observe that during the past decade all governmental Core regulatory challenges have changed in degree but not in kind; issues of scale, jurisdiction, and attribution, which are tied to the ability to conduct surveillance, complicate any efforts to regulate online activity. The ability to identify individuals associated with online activity facilitates regulation... and mechanisms that allow individuals to cloak their identity or to take refuge outside of their government’s jurisdiction reduce regulatory effectiveness.¹⁸⁰ In their 2014 report by The President’s Review Group on Intelligence and Communications Technologies, Richard A. Clarke, Michael J. Stone, Cass R. Sunstein &amp; Peter Swire state that: When public officials acquire foreign intelligence information, they seek to reduce risks, above all risks to national security. The challenge, of course, is that multiple risks are involved. Government must consider all of those risks, not a subset, when it is creating sensible safeguards. In addition to reducing risks to national security, public officials must consider four other risks: --- ¹⁷⁸ Melissa Hathaway, Chris Demchak, Jason Kerben, Jennifer McArdle &amp; Francesca Spidalieri, *Cyber Readiness Index 2.0: A Plan for Cyber Readiness: A Baseline and an Index*, POTOMAC INST.

Rogers observes: I liken our historical moment to the situation that confronted the U.S. early in the Cold War, when it became obvious that the Soviet Union and others could build hydrogen bombs and the superpower competition showed worrying signs of instability. We rapidly learned that we needed a nuclear force that was deployed across the three legs of the triad and underpinned by robust command and control mechanisms, far-reaching intelligence, and policy structures including a declared deterrence posture. Building these nuclear forces and the policy and support structures around them took time and did not cause a nuclear war or make the world less safe. On the contrary, it made deterrence predictable, helped to lower tensions, and ultimately facilitated arms control negotiations. While the analogy to cyberspace is not exact, it seems clear that our ¹⁸¹ Richard A. Clarke, Michael J. Stone, Cass R.

Just as we fashioned a formidable nuclear capability that served us through the Cold War and beyond, I am confident in our ability to keep pace with adversaries who are determined to control “their” corners of cyberspace, to exfiltrate our intellectual property, and to disrupt the functioning of our institutions. They are every bit as determined, creative, and persistent in these efforts as the Soviet leaders we contained during the Cold War, and unfortunately we see few hints they will act more responsibly in cyberspace. Thus we must commit to the long-term goal of building a truly open, secure cyberspace governed collaboratively by many stakeholders, while we remain prepared for crises and contingencies that can arise along the way—just as we do in every other domain.¹⁸³ By the end of 2015, Harvard’s Jessica Stein observes, “[l]ooking forward, cyberterrorism and cyberwar will likely pose a more serious threat to Americans’ well-being than conventional terrorist violence, and government surveillance is and will remain an essential weapon against cyberattacks.”¹⁸⁴ During early 2016, President Barack Obama, while announcing his new cyber budget provisions and cybersecurity initiatives, stated: My budget includes more than $19 billion for cybersecurity, which is up by more than one-third. And with this plan, we intend to modernize federal IT by replacing and retiring outdated systems that are vulnerable to attack... one of the biggest gaps between the public ¹⁸³ Cyber Operations: Improving the Military Cyber Security Posture in an Uncertain Threat Environment: Hearing Before the Subcomm. on Emerging Threats and Capabilities of the H.

Our Social Security system still runs on a Cobalt platform that dates back to the ‘60s. Our IRS systems are archaic... If we’re going to really secure those in a serious way, then we need to upgrade them...¹⁸⁵ ## More Lessons from History Jason Healey is a former Director of Cyber Policy during the Obama Administration and cautions that “[c]yber history has been forgotten, ignored as irrelevant, or intentionally falsified... [while] the issues faced today are largely reflected in, or are exactly the same as, those faced by the previous generation.”¹⁸⁶ Today, recruiting skilled talent to defend against cyber attack remains a challenge.¹⁸⁷ However, as Mr. Healey observes about cyber defenders, As each new wave of entrants, every five years or so, feels that they are the pioneers. Since they are not taught any history of their field, many accordingly fail to distinguish between what is actually new versus what is just new to them. In addition, cyberspace not only has many characteristics which are non-intuitive to (older) policymakers, but it seems to be forever changing... Admittedly, the field is still emerging rapidly, and we are at the beginning of the ‘cyber age.’ But that is no reason to ignore the useful lessons of its current history.¹⁸⁸ --- ¹⁸⁵ *Remarks by the President Obama on New Cybersecurity Initiatives* (Feb. 9, 2016), https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/02/09/remarks-president-new-cybersecurity-initiatives (last viewed Apr. 13, 2016); see also *President Obama, Protecting U.S. Innovation from Cyberthreats*, WALL ST.

[And] in the earnest hope that something constructive may be accomplished that will aid our national defense and preclude a repetition of the disaster of December 7, 1941.”¹⁹⁰ As our strategy evolves to detect, mitigate, and fight cyberattacks, reflection upon these principles, and how, if at all, they may differ in today’s rapidly changing technological environment, may prove helpful. The principles are as follows: --- ¹⁸⁹ S. Rep.

Now, just as in the days and weeks immediately preceding the 1941 attack against the United States at Pearl Harbor, all the necessary warning signs are there. Enemies have probed and fully mapped the data systems of America’s important corporations and institutions. The future of the United States, represented by its intellectual property, has systematically been stolen by its adversaries. Initial sounding of the alarm, “the hackers are coming; the hackers are coming” may have already faded from deaf ears. However, beware, the hackers are here!
