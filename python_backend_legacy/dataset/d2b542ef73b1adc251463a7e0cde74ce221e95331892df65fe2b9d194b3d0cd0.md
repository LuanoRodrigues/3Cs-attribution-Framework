In existing scholarship, many reasons have informed growing support for the promise of 'due diligence' obligations in regulating transboundary cyber operations. We affirm this position through a study of the specific context of Botnets, although bringing much-needed caution and complexity to the discourse. We offer a comprehensive account of the standard of conduct expected of States in detecting, mitigating and preventing Botnet-linked harms under due diligence; as well as to pursue cyber capacity building toward discharging these obligations. In so doing, we problematize and elaborate on the nature of due diligence as an obligation of conduct, therefore accounting for differential State capacities against Botnet-linked harms. The paper involves attempts to unpack a coherent conception of due diligence, appreciating the spectrum of obligations that it demands, and demonstrating these nuances through an appraisal of good practices adopted by States and private actors against Botnets. Consequently, we provide a unique holistic account of how States and their law enforcement could practically understand the conduct expected of them when faced with transboundary Botnets on a case-to-case basis. In the end, while underscoring potential dilemmas within this legal regime that may be faced by target States, as also its unresolved questions, we submit that due diligence is indeed the most appropriate candidate to act as a legal arsenal against transboundary Botnets.\nKEYWORDS: cyberspace, international law, due diligence, cybersecurity, Botnets.\n# INTRODUCTION\nThe past decades have witnessed unforeseen and unprecedented technological advancements.

In summary, there is no effective special law-governing inter-State conduct against cybercrime. Confusion, therefore, prevails as to the legal obligations of States around Botnets and transboundary cyber operations broadly\n² Vasileios Karagiannopoulos, *Living With Hacktivism From Conflict to Symbiosis* (Palgrave Macmillan, 2018) 1–13.\n³ Michael N.

In The relevance of due diligence for cyberspace, we offer a renewed theoretical formulation of due diligence, which is more precise and clearer than existing scholarship. Simultaneously, we consider why this formulation is appropriate for cyberspace and against Botnets. Since due diligence involves “best effort” obligations, we then dive deep into how the standard of conduct expected from each State would vary based on State cyber capacity differentials and the context of the cyber threat. This analysis in Unpacking differential standards of conduct is accompanied by our reflections on the evidentiary dilemmas that States affected by transboundary harm would face in proving breaches of due diligence.\nThereafter, we categorically elaborate the specific obligations demanded by due diligence in relation to Botnets. Triggers for due diligence obligations discuss the trigger points for the majority of due diligence obligations to become applicable. We then discuss obligations concerning the mitigation and prevention of harm that Botnets may cause to other States as well as the role of international cooperation in this regard. In Impact assessment obligations around Botnets, we analyze the obligation to conduct “impact assessments” in case of a preliminary risk of transboundary harm; and in Mitigating or preventing Botnet-related harms, we proceed to mitigation and prevention obligations, while tracing several instances of State and private-led efforts against various Botnets. Finally, we elaborate the obligation of States toward cyber capacity building against Botnet-like threats in The obligation toward cyber capacity building, with extensive discussion of good practices in that context.

Instead, in Reconceiving due diligence, we focus on providing an original and clear theoretical conception of the demands of due diligence. Following this, we briefly discuss in The preference for due diligence the reasons for scholarly confidence in due diligence obligations in the context of cyberspace.\n# Reconceiving due diligence\nTo what end are due diligence obligations designed? Some scholars have differentiated between two allegedly distinct conceptions of due diligence: first, the 'Corfu Channel principle' as emergent from the earliest judgment of the International Court of Justice²⁵ (ICJ); and second, the 'prevention of harm principle'.²⁶ Turning to the first, the ICJ in Corfu Channel held that Albania violated international law by failing to notify British Ships that Albanian territorial waters contained a minefield.²⁷ This was even though Albania itself was not found responsible for laying the said mines.²⁸ The ICJ also held this to be in breach of the obligation \"not to knowingly allow its territory\" to be \"used for acts contrary to the rights of other States\" [emphasis ours].²⁹ Certain authors consider this to mean that due diligence is a 'standard of conduct' which attaches to \"primary\" norms, including in respecting the \"rights\" of other States.³⁰ For example, in Bosnian genocide, the ICJ held that Serbia and Montenegro violated its duty to prevent genocide in Srebrenica, by failing to exercise \"due diligence\" in using all \"all means reasonably at its disposal\".³¹ In this conception, due diligence does not create self-contained obligations, but only serves as a general rubric to measure compliance with other obligations.³²\nIn parallel, the 'prevention of harm' conception, inter alia, requires States to exercise due diligence so as to prevent or minimize \"significant\" transboundary harm to other States—when such harm originates in their territory.³³ This conception also reflects customary international law, as per the ICJ's judgments in Pulp Mills³⁴ and Nicaragua v. Costa Rica,³⁵ which concerned alleged harms to rivers. In this formulation, due diligence does contain self-contained obligations whenever there is a risk of \"significant\" harm.³⁶ Here, 'significance'\n²⁴ See generally Heike Krieger, Anne Peters, and Leonhard Kreuzer (eds), Due Diligence in the International Legal Order (OUP, 2020).\n²⁵ Coco, and de Souza Dias (n 20) Cyber Due Diligence: A Patchwork of Protective Obligations in International Law.\n²⁶ Corfu Channel (United Kingdom v.

Under the other, even otherwise unprohibited activities become unlawful when resulting in “significant harm”. What then, is the law as it stands? In their positions on how international law applies to cyberspace, many States have highlighted the Corfu Channel conception,⁴⁰ while others have supported the prevention of harm conception.⁴¹ Some have instead advanced a singular conception where both the violation of a third State’s rights and “significant harm” need to be conjunctively proven.⁴² This is also the approach of the Tallinn Manual 2.0,⁴³ thus far the most authoritative scholarly text on the law applicable to cyberspace.\nWe regret such inconsistent or incomplete formulations of due diligence by States and scholars alike. We argue that both the Corfu Channel principle and the prevention of harm principle must be construed as part and parcel of a singular due diligence norm. In our conception, due diligence requires the prevention of “significant” transboundary harm. First, when such harm is in violation of any international legal obligation, such as the duty to prevent genocide, the harm must be presumed as significant. However, as we elaborate in *Significant harms from Botnets*, only in the rare event that such an illegal act poses only inconsequential harm, due diligence obligations arguably may not be imposed on States of origin if that would cause an undue burden. Second, in the absence of inherent unlawfulness in the transboundary harm, the significance of the harm can then be examined on a case-to-case basis, using factors that we shall elaborate in Triggers for due diligence obligations. This revised conception has many benefits. One, it coheres two strands of due diligence that have both been recognized by the ICJ.⁴⁴ Two, it gives maximal clarity to States seeking to act diligently, as also to States seeking to allege violations of due diligence. Clarity is crucial for any norm to be operational in cyberspace, which is a terrain carrying its own uncertainties.⁴⁵ We therefore adopt this two-fold conception of due diligence in the following Sections.\n³⁷ Certain Activities Carried out by Nicaragua in the Border Area (Costa Rica v Nicaragua) and Construction of a Road in Costa Rica along the San Juan River (Nicaragua v Costa Rica) (Merits) [2015] ICJ Rep 200 [155].\n³⁸ Coco and de Souza Dias (n 20) ‘Cyber Due Diligence’: A Patchwork of Protective Obligations in International Law, 790.\n³⁹ ibid.\n⁴⁰ Office for Disarmament Affairs, ‘Comments by Member States on the Initial Pre-Draft of the OEWG Report’ (Open-ended Working Group, 2021) <www.un.org disarmament=\"\" open-ended-working-group=\"\"></www.un.org> accessed 1 July 2022 (see individual comments from the Czech Republic and Republic of Korea).\n⁴¹ ‘President of the Republic of Estonia at the opening of CyCon 2019’ (CyCon, 29 May 2019) <https: cjefiles.s3.amazonaws.com=\"\" cgpt=\"\" pdf=\"\" cybernorms=\"\" lawstatements=\"\" remarks+by+the+president+of+the+republic+of+estonia+at+the+opening+of+cycon+2019.pdf=\"\" cech=\"\" cech_rapublic=\"\"> accessed 30 June 2022; Janne Taalas, Ambassador Finland, ‘Statement at the second session of the open-ended Working Group (OEWG) on developments in the field of information and telecommunications in the context of international security’ (Open-ended Working Group, February 2020) <https: 10=\"\" 2018=\"\" ccdcoe.org=\"\" cdc0e=\"\" ccdcoe.org.=\"\" online=\"\" opend=\"\" opend,=\"\" ut=\"\" ut.=\"\" ut.2nd-session-of-oewg.pdf=\"\" uploads=\"\" www.cdci.org=\"\"> accessed 1st July 2022; Organization of American States, ‘Improving Transparency — International Law and State Cyber Operations: Fourth Report (Presented by Prof. Duncan B.

First, consider the frequent situations where the Botnet or cyber operation is conducted by private actors. To prove the responsibility of the State where the transboundary harm originates (State of origin), the State affected by such harm (target State) would have to prove that the Botnet's operation is attributable to the State of origin.⁵² The attribution of private actions, such as this Botnet, would only arise if the stringent factual test of \"instruction, direction or control\" is met.⁵³ The test of \"instruction\" has very limited scope, while the joint test of \"direction or control\" requires proof of \"effective control\" over each allegedly wrongful act.⁵⁴ The latter test has never been successful before the ICJ, and rarely before other fora.⁵⁵ A test that is already onerous is further complicated by the immense difficulties States face in collecting digital evidence of attribution in cyberspace, given, for example, novel masking or spoofing technology.⁵⁶ Therefore, proving the violation of other norms, such as the use of force prohibition, is far from feasible⁵⁷—especially for States lacking advanced cyberinfrastructure.\n⁴⁶ Coco and de Souza Dias (n 20) 'Cyber Due Diligence': A Patchwork of Protective Obligations in International Law, 790.\n⁴⁷ Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons (Advisory Opinion) [1996] ICJ Reps 226 [2]; Pulp Mills [101].\n⁴⁸ Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 2 [4], [8].

DILIGENCE IN CYBERSPACE\nWhile some authors raise the continuing debates over the thresholds of other primary norms as another reason to prefer due diligence,58 we do not exaggerate this factor—since as we shall show, concretizing due diligence, including the \"significant\" harm threshold also presents difficulties in cyberspace. Still, due diligence can operate in tandem with those primary norms that contain a preventive or positive effort aspect—such as the positive obligation to prevent genocide,59 protect human rights60 and so forth. In this respect, for failing to take measures against Botnets causing specific kinds of harm, the indirect responsibility of States can be alleged—even when the Botnets are not attributable to the State of origin.61 Furthermore, as we elaborate in Unpacking differential standards of conduct, the conduct expected in due diligence is flexible—responding to the factual context as well as the concerned State's own capacities.62 Therefore, in a terrain such as cyberspace and against the threat of Botnets—both of which are constantly and rapidly evolving, due diligence serves the advantage of accommodating advancements in technology,63 as well as imposing an equitable standard of conduct on the States based on their uneven cyber capabilities.64\nMoreover, as noted in Introduction, there are presently no treaties meaningfully addressing threats such as Botnets. This is, among other reasons, because States have thus far been unwilling to limit their freedoms in ways that may implicate their own policies; as also their hesitations given the unpredictable growths of technology.[65] Yet even if a treaty does arise in the future, we propose that it ought to codify due diligence as aforementioned to operationalize it in cyberspace. Even if it does not, due diligence obligations would co-exist with the treaty obligations, as has been the case previously,[66] unless the treaty provisions conflict with the custom, such that the lex specialis rule is triggered.[67] Finally, as we argue in The obligation toward cyber capacity building, due diligence also imposes a general duty on States toward cyber capacity building, which would enhance cybersecurity worldwide. This capacity building would enable States to detect and mitigate the harms posed by transboundary Botnets, which we elaborate as their obligation in Mitigating or preventing Botnet-related harms. For all these reasons, as international law stands, due diligence is the most appropriate norm for regulating the international response to cyber operations such as Botnets.\n58 Barrie Sander, 'Democracy Under The Influence: Paradigms of State Responsibility for Cyber Influence Operations on Elections' (2019) 18 Chinese Journal of International Law 1, 18-24, 52; Rebecca Crootof, 'International Cyberorts: Expanding State Accountability in Cyberspace' (2018) 103 Cornell Law Review 565.\n59 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (adopted 12 January 1951, entered into force 12 January 1951) 78 UNTS 277 Article 1; Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v Serbia and Montenegro) (Merits) [2007] ICJ Rep (2007) 43 [430]-[431].\n60 Koivurova (n 30) Due Diligence, [45].\n61 Schmitt (n 20) In Defense of Due Diligence in Cyberspace.\n62 Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm article 3 [3], [17], [12], [13], [11], [18]; Coco and de Souza Dias (n 20) 'Cyber Due Diligence': A Patchwork of Protective Obligations in International Law 787-88; Buchan (n 20) Cyberspace, Non-State Actors and the Obligation to Prevent Transboundary Harm 443; Bannelier-Christakis (n 20) Cyber Diligence: A Low-Intensity Due Diligence Principle for Low-Intensity Cyber Operations? 37; Iréne Couzigou, 'Securing cyber space: the obligation of States to prevent harmful international cyber operations' (2018) 32 International Review of Law, Computers &amp; Technology 37, 47.\n63 Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm article 3 [11].\n64 Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm article 3 [3], [17], [12], [13], [11], [16]; Coco and de Souza Dias (n 20) 'Cyber Due Diligence': A Patchwork of Protective Obligations in International Law 787-88; Buchan (n 20) Cyberspace, Non-State Actors and the Obligation to Prevent Transboundary Harm, 443; Bannelier-Christakis (n 20) Cyber Diligence: A Low-Intensity Due Diligence Principle for Low-Intensity Cyber Operations? 37; Couzigou (n 62) Securing cyber space: the obligation of States to prevent harmful international cyber operations 47.\n65 Ney and Zimmermann (n 18) Cyber-Security beyond the Military Perspective: International Law, Cyberspace, and the Concept of Due Diligence.\n6 Certain Activities Carried out by Nicaragua in the Border Area (Costa Rica v Nicaragua) and Construction of a Road in Costa Rica along the San Juan River (Nicaragua v Costa Rica) (Merits) [2015] ICJ Rep 200 [107].\n67 Akande, Coco and de Souza Dias (n 50) Old Habits Die Hard: Applying Existing International Law in Cyberspace and Beyond; ILC, 'Fragmentation of International Law: Difficulties Arising from the Diversification and Expansion of International Law' (13 April 2006) Report of the Study Group of the International Law Commission Finalized by Martti Koskenniemi, UN Doc A/CN.4/L.682, [120].\nABHIJEET SHRIVASTAVA AND RUDRAKSH LAKRA\n# UNPACKING DIFFERENTIAL STANDARDS OF CONDUCT\nThis Section contains one of the most important contributions of this article. It considers an in-depth examination of the implications of due diligence being an obligation of best efforts. First, we discuss a variety of factors to be considered when assessing the standard of conduct expected of States of origin based on their cyber capacity. Simultaneously, we elaborate how the factual context around a concerned cyber threat will affect the State of origin's obligations. Second, we consider if this breath of variable factors may evidently impair a target State's case that a State of origin violated its due diligence obligations. This allows a pragmatic appraisal of the obstacles to establishing State responsibility in inter-State litigation.\n# Factors affecting standard of conduct\nThe obligation to prevent and minimize significant transboundary harm is an obligation of 'conduct' and not of 'result.' As hinted earlier, this means that due diligence requires a State of origin only to utilize the means reasonably available to it to meet this expectation, rather than succeeding at preventing or minimizing harm. Thus, the obligations imposed on States of origin are commensurate with their wherewithal—i.e., their cybersecurity capacities comprising financial, technical and institutional resources.\nConsider the question of technical means. The most prevalent forms of Botnets involve a 'command and control' server which sends instructions to Bots from specific web domains.[71] One method of disabling a Botnet is \"sinkholing\"—here, law enforcement takes control of these web domains, and redirects the Bot traffic to severs under their control.[72] When the Dutch police took over the Bredolab Botnet in 2010, it employed this method and used its server to notify all affected users that their devices had been compromised.[73] Could one then assume that whenever a Botnet emerges, with the Botmaster operating the command server in The Netherlands, the Dutch police can be presumed to have the means to sinkhole the Botnet? The answer is in negative.\nFor example, several Botmasters have employed techniques to generate mass false domain names, owing to which locating the command server becomes arduous.[74] In such cases, concerns arise as to collisions with legitimate domains when law enforcement attempts to target malicious domains.[75] In addition, as seen in the Mariposa Botnet takedown by Spanish authorities, not all Botnets use \"static malware\", meaning that Botmasters can often update the code of the malware infecting devices so as to prevent detection of the Botnet itself.[76] This is why despite several apparently successful attempts at taking down the Kelihos Botnet, it continued to\n66 Koivurova (n 30) Due Diligence, [1]–[2].\n69 Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 3 [3], [18].\n70 For this reason, some authors characterize due diligence as an obligation of 'common but differentiated responsibility' (CBDR). However, we avoid this term given its specific connotation in climate change law – where specific obligations are imposed on legally defined \"developed\" countries to assist the capacity-building of \"developing\" countries. As to capacity-building in cyberspace, see Section on Impact Assessment Obligations Around Botnets.

These limited factors suffice to show that at times the very detection of a Botnet may surpass the technical capabilities of a State, let alone a takedown process. Thus, in the absence of knowledge of the Botnet's existence, the obligation to prevent transboundary harm would not even be triggered,79 as we elaborate in Triggers for due diligence obligations.\nWe harp on two points here. First, cybersecurity capacities vary drastically across States.80 The same conduct cannot generally be expected between so-called \"developed\" countries, \"developing\" and \"least developed\" (LDC) countries;81 or even between countries in comparable socio-economic brackets or the same region—given that their cyber capacities against particular threats can differ substantially.82 Second, to reiterate, due diligence requires highly factual assessments.83 Thus, to allege violations of due diligence, target States would have to prove that the concerned State of origin possessed the capacity to detect, mitigate or prevent transboundary Botnet-related harm in relation to the specific Botnet at hand.84\nDespite differences of capacity, some authors argue that there are certain measures for which any State should be presumed as capable—by the very virtue of being a State, such as the creation of legislations to penalize cybercrime.85 However, even the creation of regulations and corresponding enforcement agencies requires financial and technical investments.86 Therefore, the contents, scope and effectiveness of such domestic regimes may vary depending on State capacity, without violating due diligence. Therefore, one must be cautious when asserting any supposedly universal expectations under due diligence. At the same time, as State capacity advances, the standard of diligent conduct would also advance commensurably.87 Hence, if a State previously lacking cybercrime police, Botnet detection or mitigation techniques later\n77 Arsh Arora, 'Kelihos Botnet: A Never-Ending Saga' (Annual ADFSL Conference on Digital Forensics, Security and Law, 2017). <https: commons.erau.edu=\"\" cgi=\"\" cgi?viewcontent.cgi?article=\"1271&amp;context=adfsl\"> accessed 1 July 2022 9.\n78 Ahmad (n 71) Why Botnets Persist: Designing Effective Technical and Policy Interventions 9.\n79 Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 3 para [5] and [18]; Coco and de Souza Dias (n 20) 'Cyber Due Diligence': A Patchwork of Protective Obligations in International Law, 793–94.\n80 International Telecommunications Union, Global Cybersecurity Index 2020 Measuring commitment to cybersecurity (ITU Publications 2020); Andrea Calderaro and Anthony J.

Yet one is compelled to wonder if the evidentiary burden of a State to prove these variable factors may become self-defeating, negating the promising potential of due diligence in establishing State responsibility.\n## Evidentiary concerns\nIn proving the aforementioned facts, three considerations must be examined separately: the 'burden', 'method' and 'standard' of proof.⁸⁸ The burden of proof concerns whether certain facts must be proven by a particular party—as per the ICJ, the party alleging due diligence violations must prove the necessary facts.⁸⁹ The method of proving facts can either comprise direct or indirect evidence. In Nicaragua v. Costa Rica, the ICJ showed preference for direct scientific evidence, at least on the question of whether the harm alleged over the San Huan river was \"significant\".⁹⁰ Yet in Corfu Channel, the ICJ allowed \"liberal recourse\" to inferences from indirect (circumstantial) evidence proving Albania's knowledge of the placing of mines on its territory.⁹¹ This was because any direct evidence would have been in Albania's exclusive control.⁹² Analogizing, some authors argue that States litigating against cyber operations would face similar evidentiary obstacles, and thus, courts should be amenable to circumstantial digital evidence.⁹³\nHowever, even so, in Corfu Channel, the ICJ only found for the United Kingdom since its set of indirect evidence left \"no room for reasonable doubt\".⁹⁴ This is the 'standard' of proof—i.e., the extent to which the Court must be persuaded as to the existence of facts.⁹⁵ In later cases where the opposing State's direct evidence contradicted the available circumstantial evidence, this standard was not met for the ICJ.⁹⁶ This, in effect means that if States of origin are able to provide direct evidence contradicting the indirect evidence of target States on any count, the latter's case would likely fall. Crucially moreover, in Bosnian Genocide, the Court held that it would apply a higher standard of proof for charges of \"exceptional gravity\"—in that case, concerning the genocide prohibition.⁹⁷ With regard to proving due diligence allegations on factual significant harm in se, the Court has not indicated a precise standard of proof.⁹⁸ Yet at least for cases where applicant States found their submissions on due diligence as a measure of compliance for primary norms, the standards of proof may shift based on the \"gravity\" of the allegations.⁹⁹\nFinally, it should be acknowledged that the ICJ in Pulp Mills was asked by Argentina to grant similar flexibilities as in Corfu Channel; although the Court found no need to inquire into the request since it did not consider Argentina evidentially disadvantaged.¹⁰⁰ Moreover, to reiterate,\n⁸⁸ Michael P.

It appears unlikely, however, that the Court would depart from its previous approaches.¹⁰²\nConsidering all this, and in light of the differential facts to be proven for asserting a specific standard of conduct as per the previous Sub-Section, one may be inclined to conclude that proving due diligence violations is in fact more difficult than for other norms—contrary to our view in The relevance of due diligence for cyberspace. While these challenges are certainly formidable, we hesitate to dismiss our preference for due diligence. First, the high standard of proof applied to presentations of circumstantial evidence would affect submissions on any norm violation in cyberspace, not just due diligence.¹⁰³ This would include attempts to attribute private actions to States of origin, the tests for which are in any case extremely stringent.¹⁰⁴ Accordingly and second, due diligence would help avoid impunity by facilitating indirect responsibility at least in certain cases.¹⁰⁵ This is especially for cases where the State of origin manifestly takes none or negligible efforts against the private group¹⁰⁶—i.e., it enabled the Botnet's administration by its unwillingness to act for whatever reason.\nTo reiterate, it could be difficult to prove violations of due diligence expectations that heavily hinge on State capacity (such as Botnet takedowns).¹⁰⁷ Perhaps, even proving the \"risk\" of \"significant\" harm could pose difficulties, as we discuss in Triggers for due diligence obligations. Nevertheless, there would be recourse at least when States of origin attempt unilateral measures against Botnets that could have potential impacts on other States. The target State could argue that a prior \"impact assessment\" should necessarily be held—so as to examine if \"significant\" harm may result from the measure.¹⁰⁸ Indeed, in Nicaragua v. Costa Rica, the ICJ found that Costa Rica violated this procedural requirement, even though it also considered that there was no risk of significant harm at the time.¹⁰⁹ As we elaborate in Impact Assessment Obligations Around Botnets, it is arguable that in conducting such impact assessments, the potentially affected States must be consulted, thus maximizing inter-State cooperation. In any case, when a risk of significant harm is found, the obligation to notify and co-operate with the other States would be triggered.¹¹⁰ Albania's omission to respect this very obligation was what entitled the United Kingdom for full compensation for the damage inflicted on its warships.¹¹¹ Therefore,\n¹⁰¹ Alan Boyle, 'Developments in the International Law of Environmental Impact Assessments and their Relation to the Espoo Convention' (2011) 20 Review of European Community &amp; International Environmental Law, 227.\n¹⁰² Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Croatia v.

In any case, the differential standard of conduct it imposes also protects the interests of States for whom higher expectations would have formed an \"undue burden\".¹¹³ Thus, on balance, this regime should remain until and unless distinct opinio juris arises in this regard. This backdrop having been set; we now turn to the spectrum of due diligence obligations specifically applicable to the context of Botnets.\n# TRIGGERS FOR DUE DILIGENCE OBLIGATIONS\nThis Section elaborates two conditions for different obligations under due diligence to apply: first, that the risk of harm should be significant, and second, that the State of origin must possess 'knowledge' of such risk. The first difficulty arises in defining which forms of harms posed by Botnets would be \"significant\".\n# Significant harms from Botnets\nAs regards factual significant harm, the ILC has argued that assessments of harm must be amenable to \"fast evolving technology\".¹¹⁴ While declining to provide clear metrics for measuring \"significance\", it argued that such harm can be somewhere between \"detectable and substantial\"—including harm to persons, property or the environment.¹¹⁵ As we shall elaborate, Botnets may cause tangible or intangible harm, to hardware, software, data and persons.¹¹⁶ A two-fold inquiry may be carried out concerning intrinsic or instrumental harm—for example, the ICJ examined whether the discharge of sediments into the San Huan river could in itself amount to significant harm against Nicaraguan territory, or if it could cause consequences amounting to such harm, such as the extinction of its fish species.¹¹⁷ In examining this, the Court considered the scale, magnitude and context of Costa Rica's road construction project.¹¹⁸\nThe first acknowledgement then is that not every Botnet is as such harmful—for instance, their use might be for innocuous purposes not amounting to harm, or at a low \"scale\".¹¹⁹ Theoretically, it is possible that despite infecting millions of devices (having a high scale), the Botnet only spreads harmless spam (having little magnitude), or that the devices are clearly secure against the effects the Botnets seeks to cause (in the context of these devices, it does not pose a risk of harm).¹²⁰ Yet it is also possible that despite infecting only a few hundred devices, it may cause\n¹¹² ILC Articles on Responsibility of States Articles 31, 34–38.\n¹¹³ Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 3 [3], [17], [12], [13], [11], [16]; Coco and de Souza Dias (n 20) 'Cyber Due Diligence': A Patchwork of Protective Obligations in International Law, 787-88; Buchan (n 20) Cyberspace, Non-State Actors and the Obligation to Prevent Transboundary Harm 443; Bannelier-Christakis (n 20) Cyber Diligence: A Low-Intensity Due Diligence Principle for Low-Intensity Cyber Operations? 37; Couzigou (n 62) Securing cyber space: the obligation of States to prevent harmful international cyber operations 47.\n¹¹⁴ Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 3 [11].\n¹¹⁵ Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 2 [4].\n¹¹⁶ Coco and de Souza Dias (n 20) 'Cyber Due Diligence': A Patchwork of Protective Obligations in International Law 793.\n¹¹⁷ Certain Activities Carried out by Nicaragua in the Border Area (Costa Rica v Nicaragua) and Construction of a Road in Costa Rica along the San Juan River (Nicaragua v Costa Rica) (Merits) [2015] ICJ Rep 200 [155], [192]–[217].\n¹¹⁸ ibid.

Costa Rica, the Court did indicate that when the harm to an object passes a “sort of critical level”,¹²³ the harm could be significant—integrity is the least controversial measure of this regard.\nThe assessment of intrinsic harm is complicated when the effects take other forms, such as against the confidentiality of the data of the device.¹²⁴ Consider the Corfu Channel conception of due diligence, which we argued in The relevance of due diligence for cyberspace as attaching due diligence to other primary norms (a violation of another international norm is presupposed as \"significant harm\"). The breach of confidentiality could involve the leak, deletion, or threats to interfere with data.¹²⁵ Some authors consider all such intrusions as arbitrary interferences with the primary norm of the right to privacy.¹²⁶ Others argue that States' positive obligation to protect human rights (which would include privacy) is one of due diligence.¹²⁷ Yet others contend, though not without opponents,¹²⁸ that this obligation applies extraterritorially—i.e., a State of origin would owe it to affected device-holders present in the target State.¹²⁹ Reading these views together, could one argue that every Botnet that affects the confidentiality of devices attracts the State of origin's due diligence obligations? While technically arguable, it could impose an undue burden on States given the sheer frequency of \"low-intensity\" cyber operations¹³⁰—and go against the logic that negligible harm is excluded from due diligence.¹³¹ This dilemma, in informal terms, puts due diligence in an awkward position.\nThe analysis would perhaps be clearer depending on the nature of the data, whether it forms part of \"critical\" infrastructure,¹³² the scale of mass data deletion; or to come to \"instrumental\" harms, the concrete effects on human life and property resulting from the Botnet—such as causing financial losses,¹³³ the rigging of ballot machines to distort votes,¹³⁴ manipulating stock markets by using algorithmic trading from the Bots,¹³⁵ spreading hate speech on mass scales to\n¹²¹ Kim Zetter, 'An Unprecedented Look at Stuxnet, the World's First Digital Weapon' (Wired, 3 Nov 2014) <https: 11=\"\" 2014=\"\" countdown-to-zero-day-stuxnet=\"\" www.wired.com=\"\"></https:> accessed 15 May 2022.\n¹²² David Kushner, 'The Real Story of Stuxnet' (IEE Spectrum, 23 February 2013) <https: spectrum.ieee.org=\"\" the-real-story-of-stuxnet=\"\" the-real-story-of-stuxnet=\"\"></https:> accessed 1 July 2022; Saleh Soltan, Prateek Mittal, and H.

Yet even instrumental effects would require close attention in particular cases. For example, whether mass disinformation campaigns run through Botnets, in the context of pandemics,¹³⁷ elections¹³⁸ or otherwise could be considered “significant” would necessarily depend on the facts and empirics of each case.¹³⁹ Such factors could include the scale of the Botnet, the nature of the disinformation, and the social context at hand.¹⁴⁰\nFrom this long discussion, we conclude the following. First, that a variety of distinct cyber threats posed by Botnets may give rise to risks of significant transboundary harm. Second, at the same time, it is crucial for States to elaborate their views on what forms of cyber threats they consider as such harms, whether intrinsically or instrumentally, given that many cases presently involve ambiguity. Third, in any case, the examination of a risk of significant harm would necessarily be a case-to-case basis test. The same goes for the potential effects of any response measures that States of origin may wish to take against transboundary Botnets, which we elaborate in Mitigating or preventing Botnet-related harms. These complications are why, in Impact assessment obligations around Botnets, we emphasize the need for respecting the obligation¹⁴¹ to conduct an “impact assessment” to examine if significant harm may arise from Botnet response measures that could potentially affect other States.\n# The state of origin's knowledge\nIt is crucial that a great majority of due diligence obligations: that to notify potentially affected States of the risk of significant harm from private or its own activities; and to co-operate with them in order to mitigate, minimize or prevent such harm, all take for granted that the State of origin knows of the existence of this risk.¹⁴² Such knowledge can be either actual or constructive, the latter meaning that in the circumstances of a case, a diligent State ought to or can be presumed to have known of the risk.¹⁴³ As examples, in Corfu Channel, the constant surveillance of Albanian forces close to areas where mines were placed indicated its constructive knowledge as to the presence of the mines;¹⁴⁴ while in Bosnian Genocide, the fact that international bodies and other States continually expressed concerns that genocide may transpire was taken to prove Serbia and Montenegro's constructive knowledge to that effect.¹⁴⁵ Thus, for example, a State of origin's knowledge can be presumed if its own cyber infrastructure was frequently exploited by the private Botnet.¹⁴⁶ Alternatively, as has often been the case,¹⁴⁷ if the target State, other States or private actors publicize the existence of a harmful Botnet, the aforesaid obligations of the State of origin would activate.\n¹³⁶ Coco, and de Souza Dias (n 30) Cyber due diligence in international law 77; HRC, 'Report of the independent international fact-finding mission on Myanmar' (12 September 2018) UN Doc.

In the absence of such capacity, neither would the State of origin be capable of apprising itself as to Botnet risks, nor could constructive knowledge be realistically imputed to it.¹⁴⁸ In that event, some have speculated that States may use their capacity deficiencies as excuses to evade the above spectrum of obligations.¹⁴⁹ We address this dilemma later in The obligation toward cyber capacity building of the article, where we submit that due diligence obligates continuous State efforts toward cyber capacity building. In the next Section, we discuss the obligation of States of origin to conduct impact assessments in order to secure knowledge of any risks of significant Botnet-related transboundary harm from their territory.\n# IMPACT ASSESSMENT OBLIGATIONS AROUND BOTNETS\nIn Triggers for due diligence obligations, we outlined the trigger thresholds for the majority of due diligence obligations to apply for a State of origin—knowledge, and the risk of significant transboundary harm. Later in Mitigating or preventing Botnet-related harms, we finally address the specific conduct expected of States of States once the trigger thresholds described in Triggers for due diligence obligations are met.\nHowever, before that stage, we begin in this Section by unpacking the earlier stage where there is a preliminary risk of harm to other States—yet it remains uncertain whether the risked harm could be \"significant\". In such situations, we argue that States of origin must conduct impact assessments to examine whether there is a risk of \"significant\" harm from the Botnet or their response measures. First, we outline the contents of the obligation to conduct impact assessments as also an inexhaustive list of factors that these assessments should consider against contemporary Botnets. Second, we discuss impact assessment techniques employed by States thus far and their interplay with differential State capacities. Finally, we elaborate certain miscellaneous questions as to the scope of this obligation that require the urgent attention of States.\n# Setting the law and context\nThe ICJ has recognized that in case of a preliminary risk of harm, States are customarily bound to conduct impact assessments to discover if the concerned harm could be \"significant\".¹⁵⁰ If such a risk becomes apparent, the State of origin must notify and consult the potentially affected States and take measures to mitigate the potential harm.¹⁵¹ Upon discovering suspicious Botnets, a \"preliminary risk\" of this nature must be presupposed given their inherent potential for malicious uses, as described in Significant Harms From Botnets. There is also a frequent affirmation of the need for prior impact assessments in cyberspace.¹⁵² For example, in reference to due diligence, the Council of Europe considers that States must assess if a \"disruption or interference\n¹⁴⁸ Buchan (n 20) Cyberspace, Non-State Actors and the Obligation to Prevent Transboundary Harm 443; Bannelier-Christakis (n 20) Cyber Diligence: A Low-Intensity Due Diligence Principle for Low-Intensity Cyber Operations? 37; Couzigou (n 62) Securing cyber space: the obligation of States to prevent harmful international cyber operations 47.\n¹⁴⁹ O.

Indeed, without proper vigilance, States of origin could inadvertently harm the integrity and functionality of foreign devices, which may even include other States' critical digital infrastructure.¹⁵⁶\nThe ICJ appreciates that States have discretion in deciding the exact modalities of these impact assessments; however, the assessment must account for the \"nature and magnitude\" of the transboundary activity, its likely adverse impact on States, and the need to \"exercise due diligence\" in its conduct.¹⁵⁷ The ILC has taken a similar position, while elaborating that the likely effects on persons, property and environment of the States should be considered,¹⁵⁸ as we described in Significant harms from Botnets. In any event, the assessment should be rooted in \"scientific\" evidence.¹⁵⁹ Based on these legal compulsions and our research on contemporary Botnets, the following are some inexhaustive factors that could inform an effective impact assessment. Needless to add, future Botnets may evolve such that these factors prove inadequate to examine their activities.¹⁶⁰ Our analysis only serves to illustrate the rigor that ought to be expected from States.\nFirst, examining the 'size' of the Botnet (the number of Bots) can indicate the potency of its threat and its unique geographical spread,¹⁶¹ which may necessitate international co-operation. Relatedly, determining the locations of foreign devices can enable measures such as notifying users in order to remove malwares from the devices.¹⁶² Second, inquiring the precise activities pursued by the Botnets can indicate the nature of harm they could cause, as described in Significant harms from Botnets. In fact, Botnets are frequently used to earn revenue by illegal activities such as mass spam or theft.¹⁶³ Thus, to meaningfully counter the threat of Botnets in the long-term, it is imperative to cut such streams of revenue that serve as incentives\n¹⁵³ Council of Europe, 'Recommendation CM/Rec (2011)8 of the Committee of Ministers to member states on the protection and promotion of the universality, integrity and openness of the Internet' (21 September 2011) <https: cm=\"\" pages=\"\" result_details.aspx?objectid=\"09000016805cc2f8\" search.coe.int=\"\"> accessed 1st July 2022; Council of Europe, 'Explanatory Memorandum to the draft Recommendation CM/Rec(2011)... of the Committee of Ministers to member states on the protection and promotion of Internet's universality, integrity and openness', (CM Documents, CM(2011)115–add1, 24 August 2011) <https: cm=\"\" pages=\"\" result_details.aspx?objectid=\"09000016805ccaeb\" search.coe.int=\"\"> accessed 1 July 2022 [79].\n¹⁵⁴ ibid.\n¹⁵⁵ Stockburger (n 104) Control and Capabilities Test: Toward a New Lex Specialis Governing State Responsibility for Third Party Cyber Incidents 259–60.\n¹⁵⁶ Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 90.\n¹⁵⁷ Pulp Mills [205]; Certain Activities Carried out by Nicaragua in the Border Area (Costa Rica v Nicaragua) and Construction of a Road in Costa Rica along the San Juan River (Nicaragua v Costa Rica) (Merits) [2015] ICJ Rep 200 [104].\n¹⁵⁸ Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 7 [7]–[8].\n¹⁵⁹ Boyle (n 101) Developments in the International Law of Environmental Impact Assessments and their Relation to the Espoo Convention 230.\n¹⁶⁰ Mayra Rosario Fuentes and other, 'The Future of P2P IoT Botnets' (Trend Micro, 11 March 2021) <https: 21=\"\" en_in=\"\" ec=\"\" c=\"\" the-future-of-p2p-iot-botnets.html=\"\" research=\"\" www.trendmicro.com=\"\"> accessed 1 July 2022; Ben Dickson, 'IoT botnets might be the cybersecurity industry's next big worry' (IOT Security Foundation, 12 July 2016) <https: 07=\"\" 12=\"\" 2016=\"\" bdtechtalks.com=\"\" iot-botnets-might-be-the-cybersecurity-industrys-next-big-worry=\"\"></https:> accessed 1 July 2022; Shailaja Shankar, 'Ghosts of Botnets Past, Present, and Future' (McAfee, 17 December 2018) <https: blogs=\"\" internet-security=\"\" ghosts-of-botnets-past-present-and-future=\"\" www.mcafee.com=\"\"></https:> accessed 1 July 2022.\n¹⁶¹ Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 26–28.\n¹⁶² BBC (n 73); Zeitlin (n 72) Botnet Takedowns and the Fourth Amendment, 753–754.\n¹⁶³ Ogu and others (n 10) A Botnets Circumspection: The Current Threat Landscape, and What We Know So Far 11–12.</https:></https:></https:>\nREVISITING DUE DILIGENCE IN CYBERSPACE\n337\nfor Botmasters¹⁶⁴—which can only be made possible by this second measure. Third, securing information on the method of propagation of the Botnet and other technicalities such as its malware can assist law enforcement in halting and preventing its spread in the future.¹⁶⁵ Finally, the architecture and communication protocol of the Botnet must be ascertained to understand the appropriate methods to eradicate the Botnet, as also the likely effects of such methods on affected devices.¹⁶⁶ This is of course not to suggest that these factors are to be universally followed, since the extent of diligence expected from States varies with their respective capacities.¹⁶⁷ We turn to this dilemma in the next Sub-Section.\n## Differential capacities for assessment techniques\nOperationalizing the aforementioned factors requires recourse to one or a combination of various methods—categorized as ‘passive’ or ‘active’ techniques.¹⁶⁸ On the facts of each Botnet, one technique might be more strategically appropriate than the other.¹⁶⁹ Passive techniques are relatively stealthier and do not interfere with the Botnets directly,¹⁷⁰ such as analysis of spam records, and anti-virus software feedback;¹⁷¹ though we do not elaborate all such techniques in this article. Active techniques in contrast are relatively more intrusive but offer greater accuracy and reliability in their findings.¹⁷² In construing ‘diligence’, States possessing capacities to deploy either forms of technique may be obligated to determine and utilize the technique most appropriate against a particular Botnet, or at least attempt to do so.\nAn example of active technique is the method of sinkholing—which involves the redirection of Bots from the Botmaster’s malicious domain servers to law enforcement-controlled domain servers.¹⁷³ This technique, which is also characterized as a Domain Name System (DNS) approach, takes for granted that States have a certain amount of technical and financial resources.¹⁷⁴ It also necessitates cooperation with DNS operators, most of whom would be private actors; in the event of their refusal to co-operate, sinkholing can only be pursued if the operators can be legally compelled to that end.¹⁷⁵ Yet that takes for granted the presence of a legal framework that criminalizes cybercriminal acts such as Botnets, enabling the State to compel co-operation. As recently as 2020, it was found in a survey of 194 countries that around 27 countries do not even possess such laws.¹⁷⁶ The situation is worsened in the event that the DNS operator, service provider or corporation is not subject to the State of origin’s enforcement jurisdiction—in which case co-operation with other States would also have to be pursued to proceed.¹⁷⁷ Evidently, toward States of origin presently lacking these necessary capacities, it would be an “undue burden” to expect sophisticated sinkholing techniques. Even in respect of passive techniques such as analyses of spam records, there is a need for certain minimal capacities for\n¹⁶⁴ Ahmad (n 71) Why Botnets Persist: Designing Effective Technical and Policy Interventions 29–31.\n¹⁶⁵ Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 30–31.\n¹⁶⁶ Ogu and others (n 10) A Botnets Circumspection: The Current Threat Landscape, and What We Know So Far 9.\n¹⁶⁷ Supra Sub-section Factors Affecting Standard Of Conduct\n¹⁶⁸ Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 40–78.\n¹⁶⁹ ibid. 40–53, 77–78.\n¹⁷⁰ ibid.\n¹⁷¹ ibid.\n¹⁷² ibid. 53–65, 77–78.\n¹⁷³ ibid. 54–57; Zeitlin (n 72) Botnet Takedowns and the Fourth Amendment 753–754.\n¹⁷⁴ Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 76.\n¹⁷⁵ ibid. 76, 109–110; Asaf Lubin, and João Marinotti, ‘Why Current Botnet Takedown Jurisprudence Should Not Be Replicated’ (Lawfare, 21 Wed 2021) <https: \"bulletproof\"=\"\" 1=\"\" 2022;=\"\" 21=\"\" 2022;=\"\" 2022;=\"\" 21=\"\" 471,=\"\" 471.=\"\" 71.=\"\" <https:=\"\" ag=\"\" alishanda-ransomware-banking-trojans-information-stealers=\"\" blog=\"\" bulletproof-hosting-yalishanda-ransomware-banking-trojans-information-stalers»=\"\" http:=\"\" infel471.com=\"\" international=\"\" international=\"\" infel4711=\"\" blog=\"\" telecommunications=\"\" union,=\"\" www.lawfareblog.com=\"\"> accessed 1 May 2022.\n¹⁷⁶ International Telecommunications Union, Global Cybersecurity Index 2020 Measuring commitment to cybersecurity (ITU Publications 2020) vii.\n¹⁷⁷ Lubin (n 45) The Prohibition on Extraterritorial Enforcement Jurisdiction in the Datasphere.</https:>\nABHIJEET SHRIVASTAVA AND RUDRAKSH LAKRA\nfiltering out malicious content from benign content.¹⁷⁸ Such capacities, in turn, would most likely be uneven across States, especially those within the LDC group.¹⁷⁹\nA related factor is that the pursuit of impact assessment methods as described above often requires high technical know-how, for which past experiences in tackling Botnets are crucial.¹⁸⁰ An accepted indicator of these capabilities is whether a State possesses a National or Sectoral Cyber Incident Response Team (CIRT), which fosters a coordinated cybersecurity ecosystem in the State.¹⁸¹ However, as of 2020, over 63 States did not have National level CIRTs and faced significant barriers in establishing them, given resource deficiencies in institutional knowledge, skills shortages and other factors—especially for LDCs.¹⁸² This strengthens the case¹⁸³ for international co-operation between States and private actors alike in capacity-building and intelligence sharing for improving cybersecurity. In the end, this would benefit not only less capable States, but also the international community at large—as capacity-building would enable the former to better discharge their obligations as States of origin, as we shall argue in The obligation toward cyber capacity building. To reiterate, as the technological capabilities of States advance, the rigour expected in their impact assessments would also increase under due diligence.¹⁸⁴ By the same metric, if Botnet threats advance further beyond a State's renewed capabilities, the State would not be faulted for ineffective impact assessments as long as it invests its best efforts.¹⁸⁵\n## Miscellaneous debates\nBefore proceeding to the next Section on the specific obligations to mitigate and prevent Botnet-related harms, we consider it crucial to outline three unresolved questions as to the scope of the impact assessment obligation. First, some authors have argued for a universal obligation on States to conduct continuous 'monitoring' against cyber threats such as Botnets under due diligence.¹⁸⁶ Seemingly, this connects to the impact assessment stage. In our view, other scholars are correct in responding that general monitoring falls outside its scope,¹⁸⁷ since the obligation is only triggered in the event of a \"preliminary risk\" of harm.¹⁸⁸ Others further argue that this would pose capacity concerns even for developed States, or at least difficulties in making such monitoring conform to human rights safeguards.¹⁸⁹ Yet we further submit that general monitoring\n¹⁷⁸ Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 71–73; Do Le Quoc, André Martin, and Christof Fetzer, 'Scalable and Real-Time Deep Packet Inspection' (IEEE/ACM 6th International Conference on Utility and Cloud Computing, 2013) 446–451.\n¹⁷⁹ Generally, see footnote 191.\n¹⁸⁰ Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 72–74.\n¹⁸¹ ITU (n 176) Global Cybersecurity Index 2020 131–134.\n¹⁸² ibid. 7.\n¹⁸³ Ahmad (n 71) Why Botnets Persist: Designing Effective Technical and Policy Interventions 31–35.\n¹⁸⁴ Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 3 [3], [17], [12], [13], [11], [16]; Coco, and de Souza Dias (n 20) 'Cyber Due Diligence': A Patchwork of Protective Obligations in International Law 787–88; Buchan (n 20) Cyberspace, Non-State Actors and the Obligation to Prevent Transboundary Harm 443; Bannelier-Christakis (n 20) Cyber Diligence: A Low-Intensity Due Diligence Principle for Low-Intensity Cyber Operations? 37.\n¹⁸⁵ ibid.\n¹⁸⁶ O.

The issue, however, is that necessity imposes a stringent test, one that has never been met before the ICJ. In this vein, there could be cases where States of origin fail the obligation to conduct impact assessments for reasons that are legitimate but fall below necessity. The ICJ was asked in Nicaragua v. Costa Rica to find that an \"emergency\" situation could preclude the obligation of holding impact assessments;¹⁹³ however, the Court avoided this legal question by factually finding that there were no circumstances resembling an emergency.¹⁹⁴ This, therefore, remains a question that ought to be debated and clarified by States in their positions on cyber-law or a future treaty on the subject.\nFinally, it is accepted that once a risk of \"significant\" harm is determined, the State of origin must co-operate and consult potentially affected States in good faith.¹⁹⁵ Yet some consider that inter-State co-operation is crucial even during the prior stage of impact assessments.¹⁹⁶ The basis for this assertion is that an accurate examination of the likely harms cannot be facilitated without co-operation from affected States, given their position to directly appreciate the risk posed to their territory¹⁹⁷—here, foreign devices infected by the Botnet. This question too was raised in the case of Nicaragua v. Costa Rica but avoided by the ICJ on grounds of judicial economy.¹⁹⁸ Given the ramifications of this question, we hope to see clearer articulations from States as to their co-operation obligations concerning threats such as Botnets. That said, we now turn to the spectrum of obligations triggered once a risk of significant harm does in fact arise.\n# MITIGATING OR PREVENTING BOTNET-RELATED HARMS\nTo reiterate once again, States of origin must use all means at their disposal to prevent or mitigate harm to target States emanating from the former's territory.¹⁹⁹ This due diligence obligation would arise either upon the State's own impact assessment or by constructive knowledge as\n¹⁹⁰ General monitoring which entails deep packet inspection at scale requires significant computing power.

The mitigating measures the State must take depend on the nature of the harm (including its \"seriousness\" and \"likelihood\"²⁰⁰), the State's capacity, and other circumstances of the case.²⁰¹ The harm in question may result from either the Botnet itself, or through response measures taken by the State of origin against the Botnet. We do not propose that there are specific forms of measures that are universal expectations against any and all Botnets. The purpose of this Section is only to provide an account of contemporary mitigating measures that in our view serve as good practices that depending on the facts, could likely meet the States' due diligence obligations. Like before, we also acknowledge capacity differentials in the discussion.\nWe consider five forms of measures that together could entirely mitigate Botnet-related harms: first, the takeover or takedown of the Botnet, second, the subsequent clean-up of infected devices, third, the fixing of software or hardware vulnerabilities that allowed the Botnet's propagation, fourth, the arrest and prosecution of the Botmaster, and finally, efforts against any financial incentives that may have led to the creation of the Botnets.\nBeginning categorically, the takedown of Botnets involves identifying the gaps in the Botnet's functioning and architecture to thereafter disable or bring it down.²⁰² This measure requires tremendous technical and financial wherewithal as it involves a specialized response to each unique Botnet;²⁰³ it is challenging even for developed States and major private corporations.²⁰⁴ Despite this, it might only provide a fleeting control since the Botmaster would resist takedowns using defence and contingencies.²⁰⁵ Given this, Microsoft's takedowns have failed so often that it has begun instead referring to these attempts as Botnet \"disruptions\".²⁰⁶ To illustrate further, Microsoft botched its attempt to takedown the ZeroAccess Botnet owing to its omission to account for the P2P structure of the Botnet, meaning that the malware on devices was self-executing—and did not respond to a command server.²⁰⁷ Alternatively, Botnets can often have multiple command servers, and the failure to eradicate all such servers has previously enabled their resurgence.²⁰⁸ Clearly, the nature, architecture and protocols of the Botnet could necessitate careful strategies. Thus, it would be absurd to consider Botnet takedowns or takeovers as a universal expectation from even States of origin with high cyber capabilities, let alone developing States and LDCs. There is a need for inter-State and private-State cooperation for collective capacity-building efforts in this regard.\nAs to the second measure, even if a State of origin somehow manages to takedown Botnets—it should attempt to disinfect or clean the malware left on affected devices if the State possesses the necessary capacity. This is because the malware leftovers also pose great risks to the \"stability and behaviour\" of the devices.²⁰⁹ In fact, in the Conflicker Botnet, the leftover malware of the Botnet disabled the security and update mechanisms of five million affected devices.²¹⁰ It is also possible for such leftover malware to join the devices as part of a new Botnet.²¹¹\n200 Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 3 [11], [18].\n201 Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 3 [11], [18], [12], [17]; Coco, and de Souza Dias (n 20) 'Cyber Due Diligence': A Patchwork of Protective Obligations in International Law 787-88.\n202 Ahmad (n 71) Why Botnets Persist: Designing Effective Technical and Policy Interventions, 14.\n203 Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 113\n204 Zeitlin (n 72) Botnet Takedowns and the Fourth Amendment 751-56.\n205 ibid.\n206 Mathew J.

One is to takeover the Botnet's command server to send a notification to users with instructions to uninstall the malware, as the Dutch police demonstrated against the Bredolab Botnet.²¹² Yet this method has several drawbacks. For example, there are often peculiar communication chains in Botnets under which the devices may not promptly receive notifications from the taken-over command server.²¹³ Further, some empirical work shows that users may question the legitimacy of these notifications, given the prevalence of false malware alert scams.²¹⁴ Since control over the command server could be fleeting, giving rise to urgencies, additional measures such as letter or telephonic warnings,²¹⁵ and maintaining a helpdesk such as the German Anti-Botnet initiative²¹⁶ may resolve this concern. However, these measures also require immense technical and financial wherewithal and thus cannot be universal expectations, even if effective.\nA second method to clean-up malware is for law enforcement to unilaterally command the Bots to delete the malware on the infected computers,²¹⁷ akin to the United States approach against the Coreflood Botnet²¹⁸ and Microsoft's against the Citadel Botnets in 2013.²¹⁹ The third method involves unilaterally patching the flaw in the security system of the devices that facilitated the installation of malware to begin with.²²⁰ Apart from being measures that only highly technologically advanced States could be expected to pursue, both these methods carry strong privacy concerns owing to their disregard for user consent.²²¹ This may also allow law enforcement to gain unconsented access to personal data,²²² highlighting the need for human-rights centric legal frameworks regulating Botnet-response measures.²²³ These unilateral measures could also cause unforeseen side effects and should therefore be contemplated cautiously.²²⁴ A State of origin proposing such measures would be bound to conduct prior impact assessments as detailed in Impact assessment obligations around Botnets; as also to co-operate with the potentially affected States. If it undertakes unilateral Botnet takedown or malware clean-up measures that result in significant harm to devices in other States, without having taken appropriate steps to mitigate such harm, it would be in violation of its due diligence obligations.²²⁵\nAs to the remaining common measures, the fixing of software or hardware vulnerabilities that enabled the Botnet's propagation is crucial to improve cybersecurity resilience, such that a similar Botnet does not emerge in the future.²²⁶ The arrest and prosecution of Botmasters would ensure that the same cybercriminals do not rebuild the Botnet once taken down, while\n²¹² BBC (n 73).\n²¹³ Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 110; Ahmad (n 71) Why Botnets Persist: Designing Effective Technical and Policy Interventions 12–13.\n²¹⁴ Wei Meng et and others, 'DNS Changer Remediation Study' (Presentation at the Messaging, Malware, and Mobile Anti-Abuse Working Group 27th General Meeting 7, 19 February 2013) <https: GeorgiaTech_DNSChanger_study-2013-02-19.pdf=\"\" files=\"\" news=\"\" www.m3aawg.org=\"\"> accessed 1 July 2022.\n²¹⁵ Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 111. ibid, page 93.\n²¹⁷ Zeitlin (n 72) 753–54.\n²¹⁸ Brian Krebs, 'FBI Scrubbed 19,000 PCs Snared by Coreflood Botnet' (Krebs On Security, 21 June 2011) <https: attacks-breaches=\"\" microsoft-fails-to-nuke-zeroaccess-botnet=\"\" www.darkreading.com=\"\"> accessed 1 July 2022.\n²¹⁹ In 2013 after sinkholing Citadel botnets used its command infrastructure to update the malware on infected computers.

Yet one commonality across all is the need for international co-operation in their success—cyber capabilities can only flourish best with collective efforts;²²⁹ arrests and prosecutions of transnational cybercriminals can only concretize with mutual legal assistance; and the social evils enabling Botnets eradicated with concerted diplomatic initiatives.²³⁰ It seems then, that due diligence is not only a gap-filling legal arsenal against Botnets amidst the presently mutually suspicious²³¹ State relations in cyberspace; instead, due diligence must also be viewed as a norm that can realize its maximal potential only in a milieu where States develop robust co-operative and consultative efforts. In that vein, it may well become a vehicle for facilitating internationalism in cyberspace, in line with its core logic. This brings us to the final Section of this article, where we detail the overarching obligation of all States toward cyber capacity building, as also the role of international co-operation in its fruition.\n# THE OBLIGATION TOWARD CYBER CAPACITY BUILDING\nAs previously discussed in Factors affecting standard of conduct and The state of origin's knowledge, the obligation of due diligence is a 'duty of conduct'; yet that carries within it an obligation which is a 'duty of result.'²³² This obligation is to build a 'minimum' institutional capacity that would allow States to effectively carry out their due diligence obligations.²³³ This framework should equip the State to be able to detect potential significant harm and to take appropriate mitigating measures to minimize and prevent the harm. This aspect of due diligence has been recognized by the ILC²³⁴ and ICJ.²³⁵ For capacity building, States should make reasonable efforts to create an ability to detect risk, and the capability to mitigate and halt that risk. This obligation of result is necessary for the due diligence norms to have any bite. States including South Korea, Canada, the United Kingdom and Australia in their report on incorporating UNGGE non-binding norms have focused on the building of institutional capacity.²³⁶ These have included raising awareness, creating an appropriate legislative framework, creating or strengthening departments for countering cyber threats, developing incident response plans and domestic policy, and enabling cooperative partnerships—both domestic and international.²³⁷ As with other due diligence obligations, the minimum baseline that is expected of States would differ based\n²²⁷ ibid 121.\n²²⁸ Ahmad (n 71) Why Botnets Persist: Designing Effective Technical and Policy Interventions, 29–31.\n²²⁹ Supra Section on Impact Assessment Obligations Around Botnets\n²³⁰ Fausto Pocar, 'New Challenges for International Rules Against Cyber-Crime' (2004) 10 European Journal on Criminal Policy and Research 27.\n²³¹ Ney and Zimmermann (n 18) Cyber-Security beyond the Military Perspective: International Law, Cyberspace, and the Concept of Due Diligence.\n²³² Coco, and de Souza Dias (n 20) 'Cyber Due Diligence': A Patchwork of Protective Obligations in International Law, 788; Russel Buchan, 'Cyberspace, Non-State Actors and the Obligation to Prevent Transboundary Harm' (2019) 21 Journal of Conflict &amp; Security Law (2016) 429, 434–439.\n²³³ ibid; ILC, Draft Articles on Prevention Article 3 [15]–[17]; Couzigou (n 62) Securing cyber space: the obligation of States to prevent harmful international cyber operations 50–51.\n²³⁴ Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 3 [14]–[17], Article 5.\n²³⁵ Pulp Mills [197].\n²³⁶ Andraz Kastelic, \"Due Diligence in Cyberspace: Normative Expectations of Reciprocal Protection of International Legal Rights\" (UNIDIR, 2021) <https: due-diligence-cyberspace-normative-expectations-reciprocal-protection-international=\"\" publication=\"\" www.unidir.org=\"\"> accessed 1 June 2022, 10.\n²³⁷ ibid.</https:>\nREVISITING DUE DILIGENCE IN CYBERSPACE\n343\non their resources and socio-economic factors.²³⁸ Consequently, this baseline would differ for developed states, developing states and LDCs.\nThis Section attempts to provide indicators which States can follow for the process of establishing the capability to detect contemporary Botnets and conduct mitigation efforts. Such indicators would also serve to illustrate the conduct expected from States as technologies and Botnet threats evolve.²³⁹ Further, States are free to design their institutional baseline as long as it is adequate for the harm in question.²⁴⁰ While being mindful of capacity differentials of States, we divide these baseline measures into six categories: national/sectoral cybersecurity strategies, legal measures, measures focusing on preventing Botnet infection, on early detection of botnets, collaborative measures, and review-related measures.\n## National/Sectoral cybersecurity strategies\nStates have limited resources and regulatory capacities. Due diligence recognizes this central pillar of policymaking²⁴¹ and accordingly, it requires states to use their best efforts based on their capabilities.²⁴² To allocate their resources and the regulatory capacity in an economically efficient manner, States should create a strategy for countering threats akin to Botnets based on a risk-based approach, which would help the State identify threats and security gaps that pose a high risk and those that pose a low risk.²⁴³ Based on this level of risk assessment, the State can focus its resources on priority areas where high-risk vulnerabilities exist. This process can be and should ideally be performed both nationally and sectorally.²⁴⁴\nNational cybersecurity strategies should become the cornerstone that guides State measures and initiatives.²⁴⁵ Special focus should be on strengthening and making their networks more resilient to support critical infrastructure, critical supply chains and major financial institutions.²⁴⁶ Such a National Cybersecurity strategy can also be developed based on a multi-stakeholder approach as recommended by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU).²⁴⁷ As regards feasibility, the most States should be able to draw up these strategies as it only requires states to take stock of their resources, their regulatory capacity and the landscape of threats faced by them. Indeed, as of 2020, the ITU found that 127 countries out of 194 countries have now adopted a National Cyber Strategy.²⁴⁸\n## Legal measures\nA suitable legal and regulatory framework is the bedrock of due diligence. As the ILC in their Draft Articles on Transboundary Harm notes, “[s]tates concerned shall take the necessary legislative, administrative or other action…”²⁴⁹. The legal framework should lay out relevant rights\n²³⁸ Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 3 [12]–[13] 17; Coco, and de Souza Dias (n 20) Cyber Due Diligence: A Patchwork of Protective Obligations in International Law 787-88; Buchan (n 20) Cyberspace, Non-State Actors and the Obligation to Prevent Transboundary Harm 443; Bannelier-Christakis (n 20) Cyber Diligence: A Low-Intensity Due Diligence Principle for Low-Intensity Cyber Operations? 37; Couzigou (n 62) Securing cyber space: the obligation of States to prevent harmful international cyber operations 47.\n²³⁹ Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 3 [11].\n²⁴⁰ Coco, and de Souza Dias (n 20) Cyber Due Diligence: A Patchwork of Protective Obligations in International Law, 787-88.\n²⁴¹ OECD, OECD Regulatory Policy Outlook 2021: Risk-based regulation (OECD Publishing, 2021).\n²⁴² Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 3 [3], [5].\n²⁴³ ITU, 'ITU Botnet Mitigation Toolkit' (Jan 2008) ITU Telecommunication Development Sector <https: cyp=\"\" itub-cyb=\"\" cyp/ecybersecurity=\"\" docs=\"\" itu-botnet-mitigation-toolkit-background.pdf=\"\" www.itu.int=\"\"> accessed 1 July 2022, 25; Shackelford, Russell and Kuehn (n 84) Unpacking the International Law on Cybersecurity Due Diligence: Lessons from the Public and Private Sectors 34-42.\n²⁴⁴ Coco, and de Souza Dias (n 30) Cyber due diligence in international law 187-190.\n²⁴⁵ ITU (n 176) Global Cybersecurity Index 2020 145-47; ITU (n 243) Botnet Mitigation Toolkit 25.\n²⁴⁶ ibid.\n²⁴⁷ ibid.\n²⁴⁸ ibid.\n²⁴⁹ Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 5.</https:>\nABHIJEET SHRIVASTAVA AND RUDRAKSH LAKRA\nand responsibilities clearly for State and private parties, and the sanctions and remedies in case of a breach.²⁵⁰ Such a framework would provide foresight to those subject to it and promote deterrence.²⁵¹ In connection to Botnets, any legal framework should attempt to meet two objectives: first, it should clearly criminalize the operation of a Botnet and second, it should provide tools to law enforcement, and other State bodies to effectively investigate and take enforcement actions against Botnets.²⁵² Attempts at facilitating such legal frameworks can take guidance from prevailing international and regional standards.²⁵³\nTurning first to criminalization, the criminalizing law should capture the range of crimes committed by Botnets; these include both ‘core’ cybercrime and ‘cyber-enabled’ crimes. States should ensure that the definition of the crimes adopted by the law should not be such that it succumbs to obsolescence very soon with technological changes.²⁵⁴ A possible approach for this is to define cyber-criminal activities at a high level of abstraction, which would also cover crimes unforeseeable at the time.²⁵⁵ This is in line with the approach in the Budapest Convention.²⁵⁶ Further in line with the Budapest Convention and other such initiatives, it is important to push for creating a uniform and common legislative baseline framework across jurisdictions, so that Botmasters could not exploit any difference in laws in different countries.²⁵⁷ In this regard, there is presently wide disagreement between States about the precise content of crimes beyond core crimes, as presently seen in ongoing debates under the UN’s auspices around a cybercrime treaty.²⁵⁸ This disagreement limits the possibility of harmonization, and thus, one hopes that a representative consensus is reached.\nRegarding the second proposed objective for laws, as Lubin explains, using existing domestic legal remedies such as injunction orders can be inappropriate for Botnet mitigation.²⁵⁹ Thus, the law should provide remedies and procedural tools which accommodate the uniqueness of cyberspace and facilitate suitable resources tailored for Botnet mitigation. The question of which procedural tools law enforcement should have can again be resolved by drawing from international standards.²⁶⁰ There is also a need to build regulatory capacity in a manner that Botnet mitigation operations could be approved at a quicker pace and the body adjudicating these requests is well versed in the specific practical and technical details.²⁶¹ Having a quicker turnaround period is important as Botnets are constantly evolving.²⁶² Consequently, responses against them can quickly become antiquated.\n²⁵⁰ Coco, and de Souza Dias (n 30) Cyber due diligence in international law 171.\n²⁵¹ ibid.\n²⁵² Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 121–22, 125, 127; ITU (n 243) Botnet Mitigation Toolkit 21–31.\n²⁵³ For instance see, Convention on Cybercrime (adopted 23 Nov 2001, entered into force 1 July 2004) 2296 UNTS 167; Arab Convention on Combating Information Technology Offences (adopted 21 December 2010); African Union Convention on Cyber Security and Personal Data Protection (adopted 27 June 2014); UNODC, ‘Second session of the Ad Hoc Committee’ (Second session of the Ad Hoc Committee to Elaborate a Comprehensive International Convention on Countering the Use of Information and Communications Technologies for Criminal Purposes, 2022) <https: ad_hoc_committee=\"\" chc-second-session.html=\"\" en=\"\" www.unodc.org=\"\"> accessed 1 July 2022; ITU (n 243) Botnet Mitigation Toolkit.\n²⁵⁴ Gerard (n 6) Botnet Mitigation and International Law 226.\n²⁵⁵ ibid.\n²⁵⁶ ibid.\n²⁵⁷ Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 25.\n²⁵⁸ Tomaso Falchetta, Deborah Brown and Katitza Rodriguez, ‘Opening Stages in UN Cybercrime Treaty Talks Reflect Human Rights Risks’ (Just Security, 18 April 2022) <https: 81105=\"\" apri=\"\" opening-stages-in-un-cybercrime-treaty-talks-reflect-human-rights-risks=\"\" www.justsecurity.org=\"\"></https:> accessed 30 June 2022.\n²⁵⁹ Lubin, and Marinotti (n 175) Why Current Botnet Takedown Jurisprudence Should Not Be Replicated.\n²⁶⁰ For instance see, Convention on Cybercrime (adopted 23 Nov 2001, entered into force 1 July 2004) 2296 UNTS 167; Arab Convention on Combating Information Technology Offences (adopted 21 Dec 2010); African Union Convention on Cyber Security and Personal Data Protection (adopted 27 June 2014); UNODC, ‘Second session of the Ad Hoc Committee’ (Second session of the Ad Hoc Committee to Elaborate a Comprehensive International Convention on Countering the Use of Information and Communications Technologies for Criminal Purposes, 2022) <https: ad_hoc_committee=\"\" chc-second-session.html=\"\" en=\"\" www.unodc.org=\"\"> accessed 1 July 2022; ITU (n 243) Botnet Mitigation Toolkit.\n²⁶¹ Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 116, 126.\n²⁶² ibid.</https:></https:>\nREVISITING DUE DILIGENCE IN CYBERSPACE\n345\nIt is important to acknowledge that any such legal and regulatory framework should draw a practical balance between enforcement interests and human rights, especially the right to privacy.²⁶³ This is because the principle of due diligence needs to be exercised in compliance with a State's other international legal obligations.²⁶⁴ To elaborate, whenever the right of privacy is implicated, the measure should meet the requirement of legality (accessibility, foresight, independent oversight and data protection safeguards), necessity and proportionality.²⁶⁵ This is linked to our earlier discussion in Mitigating or preventing Botnet-related harms as to how privacy should be taken into account when conducting mitigation measures.\nA final observation is required for the question of the State's capacity to undertake legal and regulatory measures. Some authors have argued that all states are presumably capable of creating such a framework. However, as we highlighted in Factors affecting standard of conduct and Differential capacities for assessment techniques, even creating cybercrime legislation tailored to the threat of Botnet would require financial and technical investments.²⁶⁶ To reiterate, as of 2020, 27 countries out of 194 surveyed by ITU did not have any cybercrime-specific legislations.²⁶⁷ Moreover, even if States had cyber-specific legislations, having an adequate regulatory capacity to enforce it could be particularly challenging for LDCs and certain developing states, as discussed earlier.²⁶⁸\n## Measures for preventing Botnet infections\nPreventive efforts against Botnets can be much more effective than combating Botnet-related threats once the Botnet mushrooms into harmful scales.²⁶⁹ If proactive measures are undertaken to this end, the creation of Botnets, and potentially their potency can be limited if and when States deploy Botnet mitigation measures as described in Mitigating or preventing Botnet-related harms.²⁷⁰ One way to limit the operation and spread of Botnets is to minimize and prevent the infection of devices.²⁷¹ There are primarily two methods through which contemporary Botnets can infect devices—first, by exploiting the vulnerabilities in the software, hardware or firmware used by the devices or second, by social engineering.²⁷²\nThe first method of propagation of malware can be limited first by regulating the suppliers of ICT products in requiring them to follow baseline security measures based on best practices.²⁷³ For this, States such as China, Japan, the United Kingdom, Germany, South Africa and Brazil have focused on technical standards, verification, certification or accreditation schemes.²⁷⁴ Moreover, similar to the harmonization of criminal provisions, there is a need for inter-State dialogue on global baseline security practice.²⁷⁵ This is because Botnets frequently infect devices across a tremendous number of States—for instance, the Mirai botnet infected Botnets in around 85 countries.²⁷⁶ States, particularly LDCs and developing States that do not have the\n²⁶³ ibid. 111.\n²⁶⁴ Coco, and de Souza Dias (n 30) Cyber due diligence in international law 137.\n²⁶⁵ Privacy International, 'Guide to International Law and Surveillance' (Privacy International, Dec 2021) <https: 2021%20gils%20version%203.0_0.pdf=\"\" default=\"\" files=\"\" sites=\"\" www.privacyinternational.org=\"\"> accessed 1 July 2022.\n²⁶⁶ Supra Sub-section on Factors Affecting Standard Of Conduct and Sub-section on Differential Capacities For Assessment Techniques.\n²⁶⁷ ITU (n 176) Global Cybersecurity Index 2020 vii.\n²⁶⁸ Supra Sub-section on Differential Capacities For Assessment Techniques.\n²⁶⁹ Ahmad (n 71) Why Botnets Persist: Designing Effective Technical and Policy Interventions, 26–27; Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 123.\n²⁷⁰ ibid.\n²⁷¹ ibid.\n²⁷² Ahmad (n 71) Why Botnets Persist: Designing Effective Technical and Policy Interventions, 26–27.\n²⁷³ ibid.; Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 123; ITU (n 243) Botnet Mitigation Toolkit.\n²⁷⁴ Coco, and de Souza Dias (n 30) Cyber due diligence in international law 181–186.\n²⁷⁵ ibid.\n²⁷⁶ Ahmad (n 71) Why Botnets Persist: Designing Effective Technical and Policy Interventions, 26–27.</https:>\nABHIJEET SHRIVASTAVA AND RUDRAKSH LAKRA\ncapacity to build their own security standards, can benefit from the best practices publicized by international and regional organizations.²⁷⁷ Further, the vulnerabilities in ICT products can be tackled by carrying out cybersecurity awareness campaigns that focus on end-user awareness to ensure that users keep their software and firmware up to date and install patches.²⁷⁸ Widespread adoption of baseline security practice could make it exacting for Botmasters to infect secured devices and it would limit the proportion of unsecured devices. Infecting secured devices would require more investment, and if it is more than the expected financial return, the financial incentive for Botmasters to create Botnets at all could be curtailed.²⁷⁹\nTurning to the second manner in which Botnets generally propagate—social engineering—it is a method that involves manipulating the end users into committing errors for evading their device security. This is a psychological manipulation technique aiming to manoeuvre users into making security lapses, so as to gain unauthorised access to users' private information, devices, or valuables. However, this method too can be challenged by carrying out cybersecurity awareness campaigns that focus on building tech-literacy, particularly regarding the malware-spreading mechanisms and methods of social engineering.²⁸⁰ These campaigns should focus more on private companies as end-users, given that they have greater financial resources generally than individual end-users, and particularly small and medium enterprises which are more vulnerable.²⁸¹\nA capacity-building measure that would be common as a defense for both methods of Botnet propagation is conducting extensive cybersecurity awareness programs.²⁸² These programs require financial bandwidth to fund campaigns, and technical expertise since trained professionals are needed to spearhead them.²⁸³ Comprehensive public cybersecurity campaigns are arduous for developing and LDC countries. For instance, the ITU Cybersecurity Index revealed that more than half of the countries under examination did not have any cybersecurity educational programs or training for professionals.²⁸⁴ Similarly, a study of cybersecurity awareness for users and executives in Africa found that in the surveyed countries, the lack of such awareness was a major institutional deficiency, necessitating robust programs of this nature.²⁸⁵\n## Measures for early detection\nThe obligation of cyber capacity building toward creating a minimum institutional framework also aims at enabling States to detect threats that pose a risk of significant harm. In the case of Botnets, there is a need to create initiatives that focus on their 'early' detection.²⁸⁶ These can be worked upon by virtue of various mechanisms and initiatives, including some of the presently feasible ones we discuss hereafter.

The CIRTs should engage in information sharing with relevant stakeholders and actors who may have access to information about infections.²⁸⁸ This could include ISP, DNS, anti-virus companies, researchers and private companies facing the primary brunt of cybercrimes.²⁸⁹ However, we reiterate our caution from Differential capacities for assessment techniques in terms of how establishing a CIRT can require significant resources and LDCs particularly face many roadblocks and establishing such frameworks.²⁹⁰ The third mechanism for early detection is based on the cooperation between the State and DNS operators; this is limited to Botnets with command servers that use DNS-based communication protocol.²⁹¹ Here, the focus should be on mitigation efforts. For this, States could create a Botnet-related DNS abuse reputation system that identifies automatically and accurately the malicious domain before they appear on the blacklist.²⁹² However, all of the techniques discussed above would require the cooperation of private entities such as DNS operators and could be demanding for LDCs, especially if some developing States had to compel these private entities if they are non-cooperative, as elaborated in Section on Impact Assessment Obligations Around Botnets.²⁹³ Thus, these techniques may be accepted as good practices, rather than as an obligation for States to meet, especially as they, in any case, serve as illustrations of efforts that could not be alleged as below the due diligence standard.\n## Collaborative measures\nThroughout the article, we have seen how tackling the threat of Botnets requires cooperation and improved communication between relevant stakeholders since they may hold a distinct piece of the puzzle.²⁹⁴ As we have previously noted, Botnets are by their very nature transnational in scope, and due to their scale can often only be taken down by the cooperation not only between multiple States but also private parties which are involved in the takedown, such as antivirus companies, researchers, ISP and DNS providers and other tech companies.²⁹⁵ Impact assessment obligations around Botnets and Mitigating or preventing Botnet-related harms explain how conducting an impact assessment and taking mitigation or prevention measures necessitates a multi-stakeholder approach.²⁹⁶ A concomitant aim should be to build long-term and sustainable collaborations.²⁹⁷ Currently, private actors are not always given their due importance and inter-State cooperation on criminal matters is burdensome and slow as shown by contemporary mutual legal assistance processes.²⁹⁸ Consequently, there is a strong need to create\n²⁸⁷ Ahmad (n 71) Why Botnets Persist: Designing Effective Technical and Policy Interventions 27–29; Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 122.\n²⁸⁸ Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 121.\n²⁸⁹ ibid. 121, 95–102; Ahmad (n 71) Why Botnets Persist: Designing Effective Technical and Policy Interventions, 32–33.\n²⁹⁰ Supra Sub-section on Differential Capacities For Assessment Techniques.\n²⁹¹ Ahmad (n 71) Why Botnets Persist: Designing Effective Technical and Policy Interventions, 27–29.\n²⁹² ibid.; Shuang Hao, Nick Feamster, and Ramakant Pandrangi, 'Monitoring the initial DNS behavior of malicious domains' (IMC '11: Proceedings of the 2011 ACM SIGCOMM conference on Internet measurement conference, November 2011) <https: 2011=\"\" conf2011=\"\" docs=\"\" docx=\"\" p269.pdf=\"\" www.nytimes.com=\"\"> accessed 1 July 2022.\n²⁹³ Supra Sub-section on Differential Capacities For Assessment Techniques.\n²⁹⁴ Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 121–23, 126–28.\n²⁹⁵ For instance, see, David E.

Third, the review should audit the adequacy of its overall cybersecurity infrastructure and efforts.³⁰³ Lastly, as the ITU recommends, the State can require entities both public and private to carry out an periodic cybersecurity audit that examines the information system’s security.³⁰⁴ This can focus on the physical configuration of the systems and software, information handling processes, user practices and environment.³⁰⁵ Again, all these suggestions must be treated as illustrations of good practices crucial for the maximal fruition of States’ due diligence obligations. We do not propose that these exact measures ought to necessarily be pursued as a matter of duty, especially given capacity differentials—however, these presently serve as some of the best possible examples of conduct the diligence of which could not reasonably be doubted. We are, therefore, hopeful for wider adoption of practices of this rigour.\n## CONCLUSION\nThrough this article, we have reaffirmed the increasing confidence in scholarly views for due diligence as a crucial means of regulating transboundary cyber operations. This faith was concretized through a unique legal and policy study of contemporary Botnets, which are among the gravest threats posed in cyberspace. That said, we demonstrated several cautions toward treating due diligence as a panacea against the Pandora’s box of harms opened by the advent of cyberspace, including for Botnets. This included evidentiary dilemmas that target States may face in proving violations of the norm, particularly given the differential standards of conduct expected of States based on their respective capacities—a nuance that we appreciated in relation to the context of the Botnet concerned, as also the State’s capacity against the specific Botnet concerned.\nYet, we also showed that many of these concerns apply to any international legal norm in the face of the novelties of this terrain. Further, due diligence connotes a spectrum of obligations for which target States may pursue the responsibility of a State of origin. This is from the very first stage of demanding that States conduct an impact assessment in the event of a preliminary\n²⁹⁹ Ahmad (n 71) Why Botnets Persist: Designing Effective Technical and Policy Interventions 27–29.\n³⁰⁰ Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 5.\n³⁰¹ Shackelford, Russell and Kuehn (n 84) ‘Unpacking the International Law on Cybersecurity Due Diligence: Lessons from the Public and Private Sectors 41–42.\n³⁰² Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 3 paras [11].\n³⁰³ Shackelford, Russell and Kuehn (n 84) ‘Unpacking the International Law on Cybersecurity Due Diligence: Lessons from the Public and Private Sectors 41–42; ITU (n 176) Global Cybersecurity Index 2020 146.\n³⁰⁴ ITU (n 176) Global Cybersecurity Index 2020 141.\n³⁰⁵ ibid.\nREVISITING DUE DILIGENCE IN CYBERSPACE\n349\nrisk of harm from Botnets being administered in their jurisdiction (or from the State of origin's response-measures against the Botnets); to the obligation to notify, consult and co-operate with the States potentially affected by the Botnet incident; to the State of origin's obligation to prevent and mitigate transboundary Botnet harm with its best efforts as per its cyber capacity. To that end, we also unpacked the continuous obligation of all States toward cyber capacity building, to facilitate the discharge of their aforesaid obligations against Botnet-related harms. All in all, we submitted that the promise and benefits of due diligence are such as to empower meaningful cyber resilience against Botnets. This is not just until more specific treaties on the subject hopefully take shape—instead, there is merit in supporting the codification and concretization of the norm even in any such future instruments. Indeed, the capacity differentials in due diligence may hold great promise for developing States and LDCs, given its equitable logics.\nIn presenting our claims, we have been conscious of the definitional uncertainties that the articulation of due diligence has carried with respect to the 'Corfu Channel' and 'prevention of harm' principles, including in discourse around cyberspace. Yet we argued for a novel coherent conception of due diligence that unifies these principles, providing States and cybersecurity experts much-needed clarity in understanding the scope of its obligations and trigger-thresholds for complex threats such as Botnets. We also outlined various questions with respect to each specific sub-obligation under due diligence that necessitates urgent dialogue between States. In outlining the standards of conduct expected under due diligence, we exposited scientific literature concerning contemporary Botnets, as also several instances of good practices in this context. We are conscious that those illustrations may become anachronistic as technology advances. The point, however, was largely to demonstrate—unlike thus far seen in cyberspace literature—a concrete methodology and guidelines for States to appreciate the precise rigour of diligence that would be required of them against threats like Botnets. To that extent, it is safe to presume that the relevance of these contentions will remain foregrounded for a long time.\nWhile due diligence is indeed a strong legal device to facilitate international co-operation against Botnets, the opposite is equally true. Considering not least the sheer scale of contemporary transboundary Botnets, the fullest and meaningful actualization of due diligence in cyberspace is only possible with greater international co-operation between States and private actors alike, especially for cyber capacity building. Therefore, there remains an urgent need for robust co-operative and consultative efforts against Botnets and similar threats—which in the end, would only be to the collective benefit of the entire international community at large.\n## ACKNOWLEDGEMENT\nThe authors are grateful to Professor Aman for his guidance during their study of cyberspace, and to Professor Sanskriti Sanghi for her feedback and encouragement.",

In existing scholarship, many reasons have informed growing support for the promise of 'due diligence' obligations in regulating transboundary cyber operations. We affirm this position through a study of the specific context of Botnets, although bringing much-needed caution and complexity to the discourse. We offer a comprehensive account of the standard of conduct expected of States in detecting, mitigating and preventing Botnet-linked harms under due diligence; as well as to pursue cyber capacity building toward discharging these obligations. In so doing, we problematize and elaborate on the nature of due diligence as an obligation of conduct, therefore accounting for differential State capacities against Botnet-linked harms. The paper involves attempts to unpack a coherent conception of due diligence, appreciating the spectrum of obligations that it demands, and demonstrating these nuances through an appraisal of good practices adopted by States and private actors against Botnets. Consequently, we provide a unique holistic account of how States and their law enforcement could practically understand the conduct expected of them when faced with transboundary Botnets on a case-to-case basis. In the end, while underscoring potential dilemmas within this legal regime that may be faced by target States, as also its unresolved questions, we submit that due diligence is indeed the most appropriate candidate to act as a legal arsenal against transboundary Botnets.\nKEYWORDS: cyberspace, international law, due diligence, cybersecurity, Botnets.\n# INTRODUCTION\nThe past decades have witnessed unforeseen and unprecedented technological advancements. The advent of information communication technology (ICT) has birthed a new domain in\n© The Author(s) (2022). Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

Formally defined as an “environment” comprising the “physical and non-physical components” of ICT that transmit data, cyberspace is in practice the closest arena one could informally describe as “borderless”. Yet this terrain brought with it a host of cybersecurity threats, including cybercrime.\nWithin the ecosystem of cybercrime, ‘Botnets’ are the apex species. Botnets refer to a set of compromised devices (Bots) that are controlled by a ‘Botmaster’ usually without the knowledge of device users, typically to carry out a variety of cybercrimes. There is “no practical limit” on the number of devices that Botnets may ‘infect’. For example, the Zeus Botnet has now infected over 13 million devices in 196 countries, causing financial losses of over 120 million USD. Given the decrease in entry barrier costs in the tool kits required to create Botnets, they are now frequently used for cyber-attacks, distributed denial of service attacks (DDOS), ransomware, click fraud, identity theft, and the spread of hate speech, among other threats. Considering their cross-border impact, Botmasters exploit divergences across the domestic legal systems of States to escape accountability. Owing to the vacuum of a globally unified effort against cybercrime, cyber-criminals such as Botmasters seem to enjoy a “safe haven”.\nPresently, there is no major treaty addressing cybercrime, apart from the Convention on Cybercrime (Budapest Convention) which has 66 signatories. Yet even the Budapest Convention has been criticized by many for its narrow set of obligations and its failures to keep up with evolving technology since 2001. As we write, negotiations for drafts of a new treaty on cybercrime are underway under the auspices of the United Nations. However, the scope of this proposed treaty thus far also remains in doubt, and in any case, the extent of its future acceptance would face several obstacles that we discuss hereafter. In summary, there is no effective special law-governing inter-State conduct against cybercrime. Confusion, therefore, prevails as to the legal obligations of States around Botnets and transboundary cyber operations broadly\n Vasileios Karagiannopoulos, *Living With Hacktivism From Conflict to Symbiosis* (Palgrave Macmillan, 2018) 1–13.\n Michael N.

This is a “best efforts” obligation, which would require States to prevent or minimize harm to other States from Botnets that are being administered under their jurisdiction. It would equally cover the cyber responses of States or private actors in their jurisdiction against such Botnets with transboundary effects. In this article, we affirm this position, albeit while problematizing the unconditional optimism that most authors have shown for due diligence. In The relevance of due diligence for cyberspace, we offer a renewed theoretical formulation of due diligence, which is more precise and clearer than existing scholarship. Simultaneously, we consider why this formulation is appropriate for cyberspace and against Botnets. Since due diligence involves “best effort” obligations, we then dive deep into how the standard of conduct expected from each State would vary based on State cyber capacity differentials and the context of the cyber threat. This analysis in Unpacking differential standards of conduct is accompanied by our reflections on the evidentiary dilemmas that States affected by transboundary harm would face in proving breaches of due diligence.\nThereafter, we categorically elaborate the specific obligations demanded by due diligence in relation to Botnets. Triggers for due diligence obligations discuss the trigger points for the majority of due diligence obligations to become applicable. We then discuss obligations concerning the mitigation and prevention of harm that Botnets may cause to other States as well as the role of international cooperation in this regard. In Impact assessment obligations around Botnets, we analyze the obligation to conduct “impact assessments” in case of a preliminary risk of transboundary harm; and in Mitigating or preventing Botnet-related harms, we proceed to mitigation and prevention obligations, while tracing several instances of State and private-led efforts against various Botnets. Finally, we elaborate the obligation of States toward cyber capacity building against Botnet-like threats in The obligation toward cyber capacity building, with extensive discussion of good practices in that context.

Instead, in Reconceiving due diligence, we focus on providing an original and clear theoretical conception of the demands of due diligence. Following this, we briefly discuss in The preference for due diligence the reasons for scholarly confidence in due diligence obligations in the context of cyberspace.\n# Reconceiving due diligence\nTo what end are due diligence obligations designed? Some scholars have differentiated between two allegedly distinct conceptions of due diligence: first, the 'Corfu Channel principle' as emergent from the earliest judgment of the International Court of Justice (ICJ); and second, the 'prevention of harm principle'. Turning to the first, the ICJ in Corfu Channel held that Albania violated international law by failing to notify British Ships that Albanian territorial waters contained a minefield. This was even though Albania itself was not found responsible for laying the said mines. The ICJ also held this to be in breach of the obligation \"not to knowingly allow its territory\" to be \"used for acts contrary to the rights of other States\" [emphasis ours]. Certain authors consider this to mean that due diligence is a 'standard of conduct' which attaches to \"primary\" norms, including in respecting the \"rights\" of other States. For example, in Bosnian genocide, the ICJ held that Serbia and Montenegro violated its duty to prevent genocide in Srebrenica, by failing to exercise \"due diligence\" in using all \"all means reasonably at its disposal\". In this conception, due diligence does not create self-contained obligations, but only serves as a general rubric to measure compliance with other obligations.\nIn parallel, the 'prevention of harm' conception, inter alia, requires States to exercise due diligence so as to prevent or minimize \"significant\" transboundary harm to other States—when such harm originates in their territory. This conception also reflects customary international law, as per the ICJ's judgments in Pulp Mills and Nicaragua v. Costa Rica, which concerned alleged harms to rivers. In this formulation, due diligence does contain self-contained obligations whenever there is a risk of \"significant\" harm. Here, 'significance'\n See generally Heike Krieger, Anne Peters, and Leonhard Kreuzer (eds), Due Diligence in the International Legal Order (OUP, 2020).\n Coco, and de Souza Dias (n 20) Cyber Due Diligence: A Patchwork of Protective Obligations in International Law.\n Corfu Channel (United Kingdom v.

Under the other, even otherwise unprohibited activities become unlawful when resulting in “significant harm”. What then, is the law as it stands? In their positions on how international law applies to cyberspace, many States have highlighted the Corfu Channel conception, while others have supported the prevention of harm conception. Some have instead advanced a singular conception where both the violation of a third State’s rights and “significant harm” need to be conjunctively proven. This is also the approach of the Tallinn Manual 2.0, thus far the most authoritative scholarly text on the law applicable to cyberspace.\nWe regret such inconsistent or incomplete formulations of due diligence by States and scholars alike. We argue that both the Corfu Channel principle and the prevention of harm principle must be construed as part and parcel of a singular due diligence norm. In our conception, due diligence requires the prevention of “significant” transboundary harm. First, when such harm is in violation of any international legal obligation, such as the duty to prevent genocide, the harm must be presumed as significant. However, as we elaborate in *Significant harms from Botnets*, only in the rare event that such an illegal act poses only inconsequential harm, due diligence obligations arguably may not be imposed on States of origin if that would cause an undue burden. Second, in the absence of inherent unlawfulness in the transboundary harm, the significance of the harm can then be examined on a case-to-case basis, using factors that we shall elaborate in Triggers for due diligence obligations. This revised conception has many benefits. One, it coheres two strands of due diligence that have both been recognized by the ICJ. Two, it gives maximal clarity to States seeking to act diligently, as also to States seeking to allege violations of due diligence. Clarity is crucial for any norm to be operational in cyberspace, which is a terrain carrying its own uncertainties. We therefore adopt this two-fold conception of due diligence in the following Sections.\n Certain Activities Carried out by Nicaragua in the Border Area (Costa Rica v Nicaragua) and Construction of a Road in Costa Rica along the San Juan River (Nicaragua v Costa Rica) (Merits) [2015] ICJ Rep 200 [155].\n Coco and de Souza Dias (n 20) ‘Cyber Due Diligence’: A Patchwork of Protective Obligations in International Law, 790.\n ibid.\n Office for Disarmament Affairs, ‘Comments by Member States on the Initial Pre-Draft of the OEWG Report’ (Open-ended Working Group, 2021) <www.un.org disarmament=\"\" open-ended-working-group=\"\"></www.un.org> accessed 1 July 2022 (see individual comments from the Czech Republic and Republic of Korea).\n ‘President of the Republic of Estonia at the opening of CyCon 2019’ (CyCon, 29 May 2019) <https: cjefiles.s3.amazonaws.com=\"\" cgpt=\"\" pdf=\"\" cybernorms=\"\" lawstatements=\"\" remarks+by+the+president+of+the+republic+of+estonia+at+the+opening+of+cycon+2019.pdf=\"\" cech=\"\" cech_rapublic=\"\"> accessed 30 June 2022; Janne Taalas, Ambassador Finland, ‘Statement at the second session of the open-ended Working Group (OEWG) on developments in the field of information and telecommunications in the context of international security’ (Open-ended Working Group, February 2020) <https: 10=\"\" 2018=\"\" ccdcoe.org=\"\" cdc0e=\"\" ccdcoe.org.=\"\" online=\"\" opend=\"\" opend,=\"\" ut=\"\" ut.=\"\" ut.2nd-session-of-oewg.pdf=\"\" uploads=\"\" www.cdci.org=\"\"> accessed 1st July 2022; Organization of American States, ‘Improving Transparency — International Law and State Cyber Operations: Fourth Report (Presented by Prof. Duncan B.

We also take for granted in this article the assertion that all existing international law norms apply to cyberspace, in the absence of new opinio juris to the contrary. Indeed, this is now the majority view in both scholarship and the recent positions of States. The question then naturally arises as to why for addressing harmful cyber operations, including Botnets, in particular, we choose to focus on due diligence when the entire spectrum of international law remains open.\nSeveral reasons justify this choice. First, consider the frequent situations where the Botnet or cyber operation is conducted by private actors. To prove the responsibility of the State where the transboundary harm originates (State of origin), the State affected by such harm (target State) would have to prove that the Botnet's operation is attributable to the State of origin. The attribution of private actions, such as this Botnet, would only arise if the stringent factual test of \"instruction, direction or control\" is met. The test of \"instruction\" has very limited scope, while the joint test of \"direction or control\" requires proof of \"effective control\" over each allegedly wrongful act. The latter test has never been successful before the ICJ, and rarely before other fora. A test that is already onerous is further complicated by the immense difficulties States face in collecting digital evidence of attribution in cyberspace, given, for example, novel masking or spoofing technology. Therefore, proving the violation of other norms, such as the use of force prohibition, is far from feasible—especially for States lacking advanced cyberinfrastructure.\n Coco and de Souza Dias (n 20) 'Cyber Due Diligence': A Patchwork of Protective Obligations in International Law, 790.\n Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons (Advisory Opinion) [1996] ICJ Reps 226 [2]; Pulp Mills [101].\n Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 2 [4], [8].

DILIGENCE IN CYBERSPACE\nWhile some authors raise the continuing debates over the thresholds of other primary norms as another reason to prefer due diligence,58 we do not exaggerate this factor—since as we shall show, concretizing due diligence, including the \"significant\" harm threshold also presents difficulties in cyberspace. Still, due diligence can operate in tandem with those primary norms that contain a preventive or positive effort aspect—such as the positive obligation to prevent genocide,59 protect human rights60 and so forth. In this respect, for failing to take measures against Botnets causing specific kinds of harm, the indirect responsibility of States can be alleged—even when the Botnets are not attributable to the State of origin.61 Furthermore, as we elaborate in Unpacking differential standards of conduct, the conduct expected in due diligence is flexible—responding to the factual context as well as the concerned State's own capacities.62 Therefore, in a terrain such as cyberspace and against the threat of Botnets—both of which are constantly and rapidly evolving, due diligence serves the advantage of accommodating advancements in technology,63 as well as imposing an equitable standard of conduct on the States based on their uneven cyber capabilities.64\nMoreover, as noted in Introduction, there are presently no treaties meaningfully addressing threats such as Botnets. This is, among other reasons, because States have thus far been unwilling to limit their freedoms in ways that may implicate their own policies; as also their hesitations given the unpredictable growths of technology.[65] Yet even if a treaty does arise in the future, we propose that it ought to codify due diligence as aforementioned to operationalize it in cyberspace. Even if it does not, due diligence obligations would co-exist with the treaty obligations, as has been the case previously,[66] unless the treaty provisions conflict with the custom, such that the lex specialis rule is triggered.[67] Finally, as we argue in The obligation toward cyber capacity building, due diligence also imposes a general duty on States toward cyber capacity building, which would enhance cybersecurity worldwide. This capacity building would enable States to detect and mitigate the harms posed by transboundary Botnets, which we elaborate as their obligation in Mitigating or preventing Botnet-related harms. For all these reasons, as international law stands, due diligence is the most appropriate norm for regulating the international response to cyber operations such as Botnets.\n\nABHIJEET SHRIVASTAVA AND RUDRAKSH LAKRA\n# UNPACKING DIFFERENTIAL STANDARDS OF CONDUCT\nThis Section contains one of the most important contributions of this article. It considers an in-depth examination of the implications of due diligence being an obligation of best efforts. First, we discuss a variety of factors to be considered when assessing the standard of conduct expected of States of origin based on their cyber capacity. Simultaneously, we elaborate how the factual context around a concerned cyber threat will affect the State of origin's obligations. Second, we consider if this breath of variable factors may evidently impair a target State's case that a State of origin violated its due diligence obligations. This allows a pragmatic appraisal of the obstacles to establishing State responsibility in inter-State litigation.\n# Factors affecting standard of conduct\nThe obligation to prevent and minimize significant transboundary harm is an obligation of 'conduct' and not of 'result.' As hinted earlier, this means that due diligence requires a State of origin only to utilize the means reasonably available to it to meet this expectation, rather than succeeding at preventing or minimizing harm. Thus, the obligations imposed on States of origin are commensurate with their wherewithal—i.e., their cybersecurity capacities comprising financial, technical and institutional resources.\nConsider the question of technical means. The most prevalent forms of Botnets involve a 'command and control' server which sends instructions to Bots from specific web domains.[71] One method of disabling a Botnet is \"sinkholing\"—here, law enforcement takes control of these web domains, and redirects the Bot traffic to severs under their control.[72] When the Dutch police took over the Bredolab Botnet in 2010, it employed this method and used its server to notify all affected users that their devices had been compromised.[73] Could one then assume that whenever a Botnet emerges, with the Botmaster operating the command server in The Netherlands, the Dutch police can be presumed to have the means to sinkhole the Botnet? The answer is in negative.\nFor example, several Botmasters have employed techniques to generate mass false domain names, owing to which locating the command server becomes arduous.[74] In such cases, concerns arise as to collisions with legitimate domains when law enforcement attempts to target malicious domains.[75] In addition, as seen in the Mariposa Botnet takedown by Spanish authorities, not all Botnets use \"static malware\", meaning that Botmasters can often update the code of the malware infecting devices so as to prevent detection of the Botnet itself.[76] This is why despite several apparently successful attempts at taking down the Kelihos Botnet, it continued to\n\nREVISITING DUE DILIGENCE IN CYBERSPACE\n\nWe harp on two points here. First, cybersecurity capacities vary drastically across States.80 The same conduct cannot generally be expected between so-called \"developed\" countries, \"developing\" and \"least developed\" (LDC) countries;81 or even between countries in comparable socio-economic brackets or the same region—given that their cyber capacities against particular threats can differ substantially.82 Second, to reiterate, due diligence requires highly factual assessments.83 Thus, to allege violations of due diligence, target States would have to prove that the concerned State of origin possessed the capacity to detect, mitigate or prevent transboundary Botnet-related harm in relation to the specific Botnet at hand.84\nDespite differences of capacity, some authors argue that there are certain measures for which any State should be presumed as capable—by the very virtue of being a State, such as the creation of legislations to penalize cybercrime.85 However, even the creation of regulations and corresponding enforcement agencies requires financial and technical investments.86 Therefore, the contents, scope and effectiveness of such domestic regimes may vary depending on State capacity, without violating due diligence. Therefore, one must be cautious when asserting any supposedly universal expectations under due diligence. At the same time, as State capacity advances, the standard of diligent conduct would also advance commensurably.87 Hence, if a State previously lacking cybercrime police, Botnet detection or mitigation techniques later\n\nABHIJEET SHRIVASTAVA AND RUDRAKSH LAKRA\nadvances to these ends, it would owe target States due diligence obligations thereafter. Yet one is compelled to wonder if the evidentiary burden of a State to prove these variable factors may become self-defeating, negating the promising potential of due diligence in establishing State responsibility.\n## Evidentiary concerns\nIn proving the aforementioned facts, three considerations must be examined separately: the 'burden', 'method' and 'standard' of proof. The burden of proof concerns whether certain facts must be proven by a particular party—as per the ICJ, the party alleging due diligence violations must prove the necessary facts. The method of proving facts can either comprise direct or indirect evidence. In Nicaragua v. Costa Rica, the ICJ showed preference for direct scientific evidence, at least on the question of whether the harm alleged over the San Huan river was \"significant\". Yet in Corfu Channel, the ICJ allowed \"liberal recourse\" to inferences from indirect (circumstantial) evidence proving Albania's knowledge of the placing of mines on its territory. This was because any direct evidence would have been in Albania's exclusive control. Analogizing, some authors argue that States litigating against cyber operations would face similar evidentiary obstacles, and thus, courts should be amenable to circumstantial digital evidence.\nHowever, even so, in Corfu Channel, the ICJ only found for the United Kingdom since its set of indirect evidence left \"no room for reasonable doubt\". This is the 'standard' of proof—i.e., the extent to which the Court must be persuaded as to the existence of facts. In later cases where the opposing State's direct evidence contradicted the available circumstantial evidence, this standard was not met for the ICJ. This, in effect means that if States of origin are able to provide direct evidence contradicting the indirect evidence of target States on any count, the latter's case would likely fall. Crucially moreover, in Bosnian Genocide, the Court held that it would apply a higher standard of proof for charges of \"exceptional gravity\"—in that case, concerning the genocide prohibition. With regard to proving due diligence allegations on factual significant harm in se, the Court has not indicated a precise standard of proof. Yet at least for cases where applicant States found their submissions on due diligence as a measure of compliance for primary norms, the standards of proof may shift based on the \"gravity\" of the allegations.\nFinally, it should be acknowledged that the ICJ in Pulp Mills was asked by Argentina to grant similar flexibilities as in Corfu Channel; although the Court found no need to inquire into the request since it did not consider Argentina evidentially disadvantaged. Moreover, to reiterate,\n Michael P.

While these challenges are certainly formidable, we hesitate to dismiss our preference for due diligence. First, the high standard of proof applied to presentations of circumstantial evidence would affect submissions on any norm violation in cyberspace, not just due diligence. This would include attempts to attribute private actions to States of origin, the tests for which are in any case extremely stringent. Accordingly and second, due diligence would help avoid impunity by facilitating indirect responsibility at least in certain cases. This is especially for cases where the State of origin manifestly takes none or negligible efforts against the private group—i.e., it enabled the Botnet's administration by its unwillingness to act for whatever reason.\nTo reiterate, it could be difficult to prove violations of due diligence expectations that heavily hinge on State capacity (such as Botnet takedowns). Perhaps, even proving the \"risk\" of \"significant\" harm could pose difficulties, as we discuss in Triggers for due diligence obligations. Nevertheless, there would be recourse at least when States of origin attempt unilateral measures against Botnets that could have potential impacts on other States. The target State could argue that a prior \"impact assessment\" should necessarily be held—so as to examine if \"significant\" harm may result from the measure. Indeed, in Nicaragua v. Costa Rica, the ICJ found that Costa Rica violated this procedural requirement, even though it also considered that there was no risk of significant harm at the time. As we elaborate in Impact Assessment Obligations Around Botnets, it is arguable that in conducting such impact assessments, the potentially affected States must be consulted, thus maximizing inter-State cooperation. In any case, when a risk of significant harm is found, the obligation to notify and co-operate with the other States would be triggered. Albania's omission to respect this very obligation was what entitled the United Kingdom for full compensation for the damage inflicted on its warships.

In any case, the differential standard of conduct it imposes also protects the interests of States for whom higher expectations would have formed an \"undue burden\". Thus, on balance, this regime should remain until and unless distinct opinio juris arises in this regard. This backdrop having been set; we now turn to the spectrum of due diligence obligations specifically applicable to the context of Botnets.\n# TRIGGERS FOR DUE DILIGENCE OBLIGATIONS\nThis Section elaborates two conditions for different obligations under due diligence to apply: first, that the risk of harm should be significant, and second, that the State of origin must possess 'knowledge' of such risk. The first difficulty arises in defining which forms of harms posed by Botnets would be \"significant\".\n# Significant harms from Botnets\nAs regards factual significant harm, the ILC has argued that assessments of harm must be amenable to \"fast evolving technology\". While declining to provide clear metrics for measuring \"significance\", it argued that such harm can be somewhere between \"detectable and substantial\"—including harm to persons, property or the environment. As we shall elaborate, Botnets may cause tangible or intangible harm, to hardware, software, data and persons. A two-fold inquiry may be carried out concerning intrinsic or instrumental harm—for example, the ICJ examined whether the discharge of sediments into the San Huan river could in itself amount to significant harm against Nicaraguan territory, or if it could cause consequences amounting to such harm, such as the extinction of its fish species. In examining this, the Court considered the scale, magnitude and context of Costa Rica's road construction project.\nThe first acknowledgement then is that not every Botnet is as such harmful—for instance, their use might be for innocuous purposes not amounting to harm, or at a low \"scale\". Theoretically, it is possible that despite infecting millions of devices (having a high scale), the Botnet only spreads harmless spam (having little magnitude), or that the devices are clearly secure against the effects the Botnets seeks to cause (in the context of these devices, it does not pose a risk of harm). Yet it is also possible that despite infecting only a few hundred devices, it may cause\n ILC Articles on Responsibility of States Articles 31, 34–38.\n Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 3 [3], [17], [12], [13], [11], [16]; Coco and de Souza Dias (n 20) 'Cyber Due Diligence': A Patchwork of Protective Obligations in International Law, 787-88; Buchan (n 20) Cyberspace, Non-State Actors and the Obligation to Prevent Transboundary Harm 443; Bannelier-Christakis (n 20) Cyber Diligence: A Low-Intensity Due Diligence Principle for Low-Intensity Cyber Operations? 37; Couzigou (n 62) Securing cyber space: the obligation of States to prevent harmful international cyber operations 47.\n Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 3 [11].\n Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 2 [4].\n Coco and de Souza Dias (n 20) 'Cyber Due Diligence': A Patchwork of Protective Obligations in International Law 793.\n Certain Activities Carried out by Nicaragua in the Border Area (Costa Rica v Nicaragua) and Construction of a Road in Costa Rica along the San Juan River (Nicaragua v Costa Rica) (Merits) [2015] ICJ Rep 200 [155], [192]–[217].\n ibid.

Consider the Corfu Channel conception of due diligence, which we argued in The relevance of due diligence for cyberspace as attaching due diligence to other primary norms (a violation of another international norm is presupposed as \"significant harm\"). The breach of confidentiality could involve the leak, deletion, or threats to interfere with data. Some authors consider all such intrusions as arbitrary interferences with the primary norm of the right to privacy. Others argue that States' positive obligation to protect human rights (which would include privacy) is one of due diligence. Yet others contend, though not without opponents, that this obligation applies extraterritorially—i.e., a State of origin would owe it to affected device-holders present in the target State. Reading these views together, could one argue that every Botnet that affects the confidentiality of devices attracts the State of origin's due diligence obligations? While technically arguable, it could impose an undue burden on States given the sheer frequency of \"low-intensity\" cyber operations—and go against the logic that negligible harm is excluded from due diligence. This dilemma, in informal terms, puts due diligence in an awkward position.\nThe analysis would perhaps be clearer depending on the nature of the data, whether it forms part of \"critical\" infrastructure, the scale of mass data deletion; or to come to \"instrumental\" harms, the concrete effects on human life and property resulting from the Botnet—such as causing financial losses, the rigging of ballot machines to distort votes, manipulating stock markets by using algorithmic trading from the Bots, spreading hate speech on mass scales to\n Kim Zetter, 'An Unprecedented Look at Stuxnet, the World's First Digital Weapon' (Wired, 3 Nov 2014) <https: 11=\"\" 2014=\"\" countdown-to-zero-day-stuxnet=\"\" www.wired.com=\"\"></https:> accessed 15 May 2022.\n David Kushner, 'The Real Story of Stuxnet' (IEE Spectrum, 23 February 2013) <https: spectrum.ieee.org=\"\" the-real-story-of-stuxnet=\"\" the-real-story-of-stuxnet=\"\"></https:> accessed 1 July 2022; Saleh Soltan, Prateek Mittal, and H.

Yet even instrumental effects would require close attention in particular cases. For example, whether mass disinformation campaigns run through Botnets, in the context of pandemics, elections or otherwise could be considered “significant” would necessarily depend on the facts and empirics of each case. Such factors could include the scale of the Botnet, the nature of the disinformation, and the social context at hand.\nFrom this long discussion, we conclude the following. First, that a variety of distinct cyber threats posed by Botnets may give rise to risks of significant transboundary harm. Second, at the same time, it is crucial for States to elaborate their views on what forms of cyber threats they consider as such harms, whether intrinsically or instrumentally, given that many cases presently involve ambiguity. Third, in any case, the examination of a risk of significant harm would necessarily be a case-to-case basis test. The same goes for the potential effects of any response measures that States of origin may wish to take against transboundary Botnets, which we elaborate in Mitigating or preventing Botnet-related harms. These complications are why, in Impact assessment obligations around Botnets, we emphasize the need for respecting the obligation to conduct an “impact assessment” to examine if significant harm may arise from Botnet response measures that could potentially affect other States.\n# The state of origin's knowledge\nIt is crucial that a great majority of due diligence obligations: that to notify potentially affected States of the risk of significant harm from private or its own activities; and to co-operate with them in order to mitigate, minimize or prevent such harm, all take for granted that the State of origin knows of the existence of this risk. Such knowledge can be either actual or constructive, the latter meaning that in the circumstances of a case, a diligent State ought to or can be presumed to have known of the risk. As examples, in Corfu Channel, the constant surveillance of Albanian forces close to areas where mines were placed indicated its constructive knowledge as to the presence of the mines; while in Bosnian Genocide, the fact that international bodies and other States continually expressed concerns that genocide may transpire was taken to prove Serbia and Montenegro's constructive knowledge to that effect. Thus, for example, a State of origin's knowledge can be presumed if its own cyber infrastructure was frequently exploited by the private Botnet. Alternatively, as has often been the case, if the target State, other States or private actors publicize the existence of a harmful Botnet, the aforesaid obligations of the State of origin would activate.\n Coco, and de Souza Dias (n 30) Cyber due diligence in international law 77; HRC, 'Report of the independent international fact-finding mission on Myanmar' (12 September 2018) UN Doc.

Later in Mitigating or preventing Botnet-related harms, we finally address the specific conduct expected of States of States once the trigger thresholds described in Triggers for due diligence obligations are met.\nHowever, before that stage, we begin in this Section by unpacking the earlier stage where there is a preliminary risk of harm to other States—yet it remains uncertain whether the risked harm could be \"significant\". In such situations, we argue that States of origin must conduct impact assessments to examine whether there is a risk of \"significant\" harm from the Botnet or their response measures. First, we outline the contents of the obligation to conduct impact assessments as also an inexhaustive list of factors that these assessments should consider against contemporary Botnets. Second, we discuss impact assessment techniques employed by States thus far and their interplay with differential State capacities. Finally, we elaborate certain miscellaneous questions as to the scope of this obligation that require the urgent attention of States.\n# Setting the law and context\nThe ICJ has recognized that in case of a preliminary risk of harm, States are customarily bound to conduct impact assessments to discover if the concerned harm could be \"significant\". If such a risk becomes apparent, the State of origin must notify and consult the potentially affected States and take measures to mitigate the potential harm. Upon discovering suspicious Botnets, a \"preliminary risk\" of this nature must be presupposed given their inherent potential for malicious uses, as described in Significant Harms From Botnets. There is also a frequent affirmation of the need for prior impact assessments in cyberspace. For example, in reference to due diligence, the Council of Europe considers that States must assess if a \"disruption or interference\n Buchan (n 20) Cyberspace, Non-State Actors and the Obligation to Prevent Transboundary Harm 443; Bannelier-Christakis (n 20) Cyber Diligence: A Low-Intensity Due Diligence Principle for Low-Intensity Cyber Operations? 37; Couzigou (n 62) Securing cyber space: the obligation of States to prevent harmful international cyber operations 47.\n O.

Guidelines on conducting risk assessments have also been provided by the United States National Institute of Standards and Technology, and the institute's guidelines are taken as baselines by the United Kingdom, Japan, Estonia, Korea, Israel and Germany. This is also echoed in other instruments, such as the European Union data protection framework.\nStates of origin will be obligated to conduct impact assessments in two cases: first, to understand if Botnets administered in their jurisdiction pose threats to other States; and second, to appreciate any risk of significant harm that their proposed response measures against the Botnet may pose to target States. Indeed, without proper vigilance, States of origin could inadvertently harm the integrity and functionality of foreign devices, which may even include other States' critical digital infrastructure.\nThe ICJ appreciates that States have discretion in deciding the exact modalities of these impact assessments; however, the assessment must account for the \"nature and magnitude\" of the transboundary activity, its likely adverse impact on States, and the need to \"exercise due diligence\" in its conduct. The ILC has taken a similar position, while elaborating that the likely effects on persons, property and environment of the States should be considered, as we described in Significant harms from Botnets. In any event, the assessment should be rooted in \"scientific\" evidence. Based on these legal compulsions and our research on contemporary Botnets, the following are some inexhaustive factors that could inform an effective impact assessment. Needless to add, future Botnets may evolve such that these factors prove inadequate to examine their activities. Our analysis only serves to illustrate the rigor that ought to be expected from States.\nFirst, examining the 'size' of the Botnet (the number of Bots) can indicate the potency of its threat and its unique geographical spread, which may necessitate international co-operation. Relatedly, determining the locations of foreign devices can enable measures such as notifying users in order to remove malwares from the devices. Second, inquiring the precise activities pursued by the Botnets can indicate the nature of harm they could cause, as described in Significant harms from Botnets. In fact, Botnets are frequently used to earn revenue by illegal activities such as mass spam or theft. Thus, to meaningfully counter the threat of Botnets in the long-term, it is imperative to cut such streams of revenue that serve as incentives\n Council of Europe, 'Recommendation CM/Rec (2011)8 of the Committee of Ministers to member states on the protection and promotion of the universality, integrity and openness of the Internet' (21 September 2011) <https: cm=\"\" pages=\"\" result_details.aspx?objectid=\"09000016805cc2f8\" search.coe.int=\"\"> accessed 1st July 2022; Council of Europe, 'Explanatory Memorandum to the draft Recommendation CM/Rec(2011)... of the Committee of Ministers to member states on the protection and promotion of Internet's universality, integrity and openness', (CM Documents, CM(2011)115–add1, 24 August 2011) <https: cm=\"\" pages=\"\" result_details.aspx?objectid=\"09000016805ccaeb\" search.coe.int=\"\"> accessed 1 July 2022 [79].\n ibid.\n Stockburger (n 104) Control and Capabilities Test: Toward a New Lex Specialis Governing State Responsibility for Third Party Cyber Incidents 259–60.\n Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 90.\n Pulp Mills [205]; Certain Activities Carried out by Nicaragua in the Border Area (Costa Rica v Nicaragua) and Construction of a Road in Costa Rica along the San Juan River (Nicaragua v Costa Rica) (Merits) [2015] ICJ Rep 200 [104].\n Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 7 [7]–[8].\n Boyle (n 101) Developments in the International Law of Environmental Impact Assessments and their Relation to the Espoo Convention 230.\n Mayra Rosario Fuentes and other, 'The Future of P2P IoT Botnets' (Trend Micro, 11 March 2021) <https: 21=\"\" en_in=\"\" ec=\"\" c=\"\" the-future-of-p2p-iot-botnets.html=\"\" research=\"\" www.trendmicro.com=\"\"> accessed 1 July 2022; Ben Dickson, 'IoT botnets might be the cybersecurity industry's next big worry' (IOT Security Foundation, 12 July 2016) <https: 07=\"\" 12=\"\" 2016=\"\" bdtechtalks.com=\"\" iot-botnets-might-be-the-cybersecurity-industrys-next-big-worry=\"\"></https:> accessed 1 July 2022; Shailaja Shankar, 'Ghosts of Botnets Past, Present, and Future' (McAfee, 17 December 2018) <https: blogs=\"\" internet-security=\"\" ghosts-of-botnets-past-present-and-future=\"\" www.mcafee.com=\"\"></https:> accessed 1 July 2022.\n Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 26–28.\n BBC (n 73); Zeitlin (n 72) Botnet Takedowns and the Fourth Amendment, 753–754.\n Ogu and others (n 10) A Botnets Circumspection: The Current Threat Landscape, and What We Know So Far 11–12.</https:></https:></https:>\nREVISITING DUE DILIGENCE IN CYBERSPACE\n\n## Differential capacities for assessment techniques\nOperationalizing the aforementioned factors requires recourse to one or a combination of various methods—categorized as ‘passive’ or ‘active’ techniques. On the facts of each Botnet, one technique might be more strategically appropriate than the other. Passive techniques are relatively stealthier and do not interfere with the Botnets directly, such as analysis of spam records, and anti-virus software feedback; though we do not elaborate all such techniques in this article. Active techniques in contrast are relatively more intrusive but offer greater accuracy and reliability in their findings. In construing ‘diligence’, States possessing capacities to deploy either forms of technique may be obligated to determine and utilize the technique most appropriate against a particular Botnet, or at least attempt to do so.\nAn example of active technique is the method of sinkholing—which involves the redirection of Bots from the Botmaster’s malicious domain servers to law enforcement-controlled domain servers. This technique, which is also characterized as a Domain Name System (DNS) approach, takes for granted that States have a certain amount of technical and financial resources. It also necessitates cooperation with DNS operators, most of whom would be private actors; in the event of their refusal to co-operate, sinkholing can only be pursued if the operators can be legally compelled to that end. Yet that takes for granted the presence of a legal framework that criminalizes cybercriminal acts such as Botnets, enabling the State to compel co-operation. As recently as 2020, it was found in a survey of 194 countries that around 27 countries do not even possess such laws. The situation is worsened in the event that the DNS operator, service provider or corporation is not subject to the State of origin’s enforcement jurisdiction—in which case co-operation with other States would also have to be pursued to proceed. Evidently, toward States of origin presently lacking these necessary capacities, it would be an “undue burden” to expect sophisticated sinkholing techniques. Even in respect of passive techniques such as analyses of spam records, there is a need for certain minimal capacities for\n Ahmad (n 71) Why Botnets Persist: Designing Effective Technical and Policy Interventions 29–31.\n Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 30–31.\n Ogu and others (n 10) A Botnets Circumspection: The Current Threat Landscape, and What We Know So Far 9.\n Supra Sub-section Factors Affecting Standard Of Conduct\n Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 40–78.\n ibid. 40–53, 77–78.\n ibid.\n ibid.\n ibid. 53–65, 77–78.\n ibid. 54–57; Zeitlin (n 72) Botnet Takedowns and the Fourth Amendment 753–754.\n Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 76.\n ibid. 76, 109–110; Asaf Lubin, and João Marinotti, ‘Why Current Botnet Takedown Jurisprudence Should Not Be Replicated’ (Lawfare, 21 Wed 2021) <https: \"bulletproof\"=\"\" 1=\"\" 2022;=\"\" 21=\"\" 2022;=\"\" 2022;=\"\" 21=\"\" 471,=\"\" 471.=\"\" 71.=\"\" <https:=\"\" ag=\"\" alishanda-ransomware-banking-trojans-information-stealers=\"\" blog=\"\" bulletproof-hosting-yalishanda-ransomware-banking-trojans-information-stalers»=\"\" http:=\"\" infel471.com=\"\" international=\"\" international=\"\" infel4711=\"\" blog=\"\" telecommunications=\"\" union,=\"\" www.lawfareblog.com=\"\"> accessed 1 May 2022.\n International Telecommunications Union, Global Cybersecurity Index 2020 Measuring commitment to cybersecurity (ITU Publications 2020) vii.\n Lubin (n 45) The Prohibition on Extraterritorial Enforcement Jurisdiction in the Datasphere.</https:>\nABHIJEET SHRIVASTAVA AND RUDRAKSH LAKRA\nfiltering out malicious content from benign content. Such capacities, in turn, would most likely be uneven across States, especially those within the LDC group.\nA related factor is that the pursuit of impact assessment methods as described above often requires high technical know-how, for which past experiences in tackling Botnets are crucial. An accepted indicator of these capabilities is whether a State possesses a National or Sectoral Cyber Incident Response Team (CIRT), which fosters a coordinated cybersecurity ecosystem in the State. However, as of 2020, over 63 States did not have National level CIRTs and faced significant barriers in establishing them, given resource deficiencies in institutional knowledge, skills shortages and other factors—especially for LDCs. This strengthens the case for international co-operation between States and private actors alike in capacity-building and intelligence sharing for improving cybersecurity. In the end, this would benefit not only less capable States, but also the international community at large—as capacity-building would enable the former to better discharge their obligations as States of origin, as we shall argue in The obligation toward cyber capacity building. To reiterate, as the technological capabilities of States advance, the rigour expected in their impact assessments would also increase under due diligence. By the same metric, if Botnet threats advance further beyond a State's renewed capabilities, the State would not be faulted for ineffective impact assessments as long as it invests its best efforts.\n## Miscellaneous debates\nBefore proceeding to the next Section on the specific obligations to mitigate and prevent Botnet-related harms, we consider it crucial to outline three unresolved questions as to the scope of the impact assessment obligation. First, some authors have argued for a universal obligation on States to conduct continuous 'monitoring' against cyber threats such as Botnets under due diligence. Seemingly, this connects to the impact assessment stage. In our view, other scholars are correct in responding that general monitoring falls outside its scope, since the obligation is only triggered in the event of a \"preliminary risk\" of harm. Others further argue that this would pose capacity concerns even for developed States, or at least difficulties in making such monitoring conform to human rights safeguards. Yet we further submit that general monitoring\n Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 71–73; Do Le Quoc, André Martin, and Christof Fetzer, 'Scalable and Real-Time Deep Packet Inspection' (IEEE/ACM 6th International Conference on Utility and Cloud Computing, 2013) 446–451.\n Generally, see footnote 191.\n Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 72–74.\n ITU (n 176) Global Cybersecurity Index 2020 131–134.\n ibid. 7.\n Ahmad (n 71) Why Botnets Persist: Designing Effective Technical and Policy Interventions 31–35.\n Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 3 [3], [17], [12], [13], [11], [16]; Coco, and de Souza Dias (n 20) 'Cyber Due Diligence': A Patchwork of Protective Obligations in International Law 787–88; Buchan (n 20) Cyberspace, Non-State Actors and the Obligation to Prevent Transboundary Harm 443; Bannelier-Christakis (n 20) Cyber Diligence: A Low-Intensity Due Diligence Principle for Low-Intensity Cyber Operations? 37.\n ibid.\n O.

Okwori (n 20) The Obligation of Due Diligence and Cyber-Attacks: Bridging the Gap Between Universal and Differential Approaches for States 234.\nREVISITING DUE DILIGENCE IN CYBERSPACE\n\nSecond, it is well-accepted that the necessity to protect an essential state interest (under relevant conditions) can preclude the wrongfulness of an illegal act, such as violations of due diligence. We raise this point given that States of origin may often be faced with Botnet threats that necessitate an imminent takedown response, in which case conducting an impact assessment may become impracticable. The issue, however, is that necessity imposes a stringent test, one that has never been met before the ICJ. In this vein, there could be cases where States of origin fail the obligation to conduct impact assessments for reasons that are legitimate but fall below necessity. The ICJ was asked in Nicaragua v. Costa Rica to find that an \"emergency\" situation could preclude the obligation of holding impact assessments; however, the Court avoided this legal question by factually finding that there were no circumstances resembling an emergency. This, therefore, remains a question that ought to be debated and clarified by States in their positions on cyber-law or a future treaty on the subject.\nFinally, it is accepted that once a risk of \"significant\" harm is determined, the State of origin must co-operate and consult potentially affected States in good faith. Yet some consider that inter-State co-operation is crucial even during the prior stage of impact assessments. The basis for this assertion is that an accurate examination of the likely harms cannot be facilitated without co-operation from affected States, given their position to directly appreciate the risk posed to their territory—here, foreign devices infected by the Botnet. This question too was raised in the case of Nicaragua v. Costa Rica but avoided by the ICJ on grounds of judicial economy. Given the ramifications of this question, we hope to see clearer articulations from States as to their co-operation obligations concerning threats such as Botnets. That said, we now turn to the spectrum of obligations triggered once a risk of significant harm does in fact arise.\n# MITIGATING OR PREVENTING BOTNET-RELATED HARMS\nTo reiterate once again, States of origin must use all means at their disposal to prevent or mitigate harm to target States emanating from the former's territory. This due diligence obligation would arise either upon the State's own impact assessment or by constructive knowledge as\n General monitoring which entails deep packet inspection at scale requires significant computing power.

The mitigating measures the State must take depend on the nature of the harm (including its \"seriousness\" and \"likelihood\"), the State's capacity, and other circumstances of the case. The harm in question may result from either the Botnet itself, or through response measures taken by the State of origin against the Botnet. We do not propose that there are specific forms of measures that are universal expectations against any and all Botnets. The purpose of this Section is only to provide an account of contemporary mitigating measures that in our view serve as good practices that depending on the facts, could likely meet the States' due diligence obligations. Like before, we also acknowledge capacity differentials in the discussion.\nWe consider five forms of measures that together could entirely mitigate Botnet-related harms: first, the takeover or takedown of the Botnet, second, the subsequent clean-up of infected devices, third, the fixing of software or hardware vulnerabilities that allowed the Botnet's propagation, fourth, the arrest and prosecution of the Botmaster, and finally, efforts against any financial incentives that may have led to the creation of the Botnets.\nBeginning categorically, the takedown of Botnets involves identifying the gaps in the Botnet's functioning and architecture to thereafter disable or bring it down. This measure requires tremendous technical and financial wherewithal as it involves a specialized response to each unique Botnet; it is challenging even for developed States and major private corporations. Despite this, it might only provide a fleeting control since the Botmaster would resist takedowns using defence and contingencies. Given this, Microsoft's takedowns have failed so often that it has begun instead referring to these attempts as Botnet \"disruptions\". To illustrate further, Microsoft botched its attempt to takedown the ZeroAccess Botnet owing to its omission to account for the P2P structure of the Botnet, meaning that the malware on devices was self-executing—and did not respond to a command server. Alternatively, Botnets can often have multiple command servers, and the failure to eradicate all such servers has previously enabled their resurgence. Clearly, the nature, architecture and protocols of the Botnet could necessitate careful strategies. Thus, it would be absurd to consider Botnet takedowns or takeovers as a universal expectation from even States of origin with high cyber capabilities, let alone developing States and LDCs. There is a need for inter-State and private-State cooperation for collective capacity-building efforts in this regard.\nAs to the second measure, even if a State of origin somehow manages to takedown Botnets—it should attempt to disinfect or clean the malware left on affected devices if the State possesses the necessary capacity. This is because the malware leftovers also pose great risks to the \"stability and behaviour\" of the devices. In fact, in the Conflicker Botnet, the leftover malware of the Botnet disabled the security and update mechanisms of five million affected devices. It is also possible for such leftover malware to join the devices as part of a new Botnet.\n\nREVISITING DUE DILIGENCE IN CYBERSPACE\n\nA second method to clean-up malware is for law enforcement to unilaterally command the Bots to delete the malware on the infected computers, akin to the United States approach against the Coreflood Botnet and Microsoft's against the Citadel Botnets in 2013. The third method involves unilaterally patching the flaw in the security system of the devices that facilitated the installation of malware to begin with. Apart from being measures that only highly technologically advanced States could be expected to pursue, both these methods carry strong privacy concerns owing to their disregard for user consent. This may also allow law enforcement to gain unconsented access to personal data, highlighting the need for human-rights centric legal frameworks regulating Botnet-response measures. These unilateral measures could also cause unforeseen side effects and should therefore be contemplated cautiously. A State of origin proposing such measures would be bound to conduct prior impact assessments as detailed in Impact assessment obligations around Botnets; as also to co-operate with the potentially affected States. If it undertakes unilateral Botnet takedown or malware clean-up measures that result in significant harm to devices in other States, without having taken appropriate steps to mitigate such harm, it would be in violation of its due diligence obligations.\nAs to the remaining common measures, the fixing of software or hardware vulnerabilities that enabled the Botnet's propagation is crucial to improve cybersecurity resilience, such that a similar Botnet does not emerge in the future. The arrest and prosecution of Botmasters would ensure that the same cybercriminals do not rebuild the Botnet once taken down, while\n BBC (n 73).\n Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 110; Ahmad (n 71) Why Botnets Persist: Designing Effective Technical and Policy Interventions 12–13.\n Wei Meng et and others, 'DNS Changer Remediation Study' (Presentation at the Messaging, Malware, and Mobile Anti-Abuse Working Group 27th General Meeting 7, 19 February 2013) <https: GeorgiaTech_DNSChanger_study-2013-02-19.pdf=\"\" files=\"\" news=\"\" www.m3aawg.org=\"\"> accessed 1 July 2022.\n Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 111. ibid, page 93.\n Zeitlin (n 72) 753–54.\n Brian Krebs, 'FBI Scrubbed 19,000 PCs Snared by Coreflood Botnet' (Krebs On Security, 21 June 2011) <https: attacks-breaches=\"\" microsoft-fails-to-nuke-zeroaccess-botnet=\"\" www.darkreading.com=\"\"> accessed 1 July 2022.\n In 2013 after sinkholing Citadel botnets used its command infrastructure to update the malware on infected computers.

Finally, any financial or similar incentives that may have motivated the creation of the Botnets should be targeted, since even if the Botmasters are not arrested, there would be little reason to rebuild the Botnet absent such motives.\nAgain, capacity differentials would determine whether these measures are obligatory on a State or mere suggestions. Yet one commonality across all is the need for international co-operation in their success—cyber capabilities can only flourish best with collective efforts; arrests and prosecutions of transnational cybercriminals can only concretize with mutual legal assistance; and the social evils enabling Botnets eradicated with concerted diplomatic initiatives. It seems then, that due diligence is not only a gap-filling legal arsenal against Botnets amidst the presently mutually suspicious State relations in cyberspace; instead, due diligence must also be viewed as a norm that can realize its maximal potential only in a milieu where States develop robust co-operative and consultative efforts. In that vein, it may well become a vehicle for facilitating internationalism in cyberspace, in line with its core logic. This brings us to the final Section of this article, where we detail the overarching obligation of all States toward cyber capacity building, as also the role of international co-operation in its fruition.\n# THE OBLIGATION TOWARD CYBER CAPACITY BUILDING\nAs previously discussed in Factors affecting standard of conduct and The state of origin's knowledge, the obligation of due diligence is a 'duty of conduct'; yet that carries within it an obligation which is a 'duty of result.' This obligation is to build a 'minimum' institutional capacity that would allow States to effectively carry out their due diligence obligations. This framework should equip the State to be able to detect potential significant harm and to take appropriate mitigating measures to minimize and prevent the harm. This aspect of due diligence has been recognized by the ILC and ICJ. For capacity building, States should make reasonable efforts to create an ability to detect risk, and the capability to mitigate and halt that risk. This obligation of result is necessary for the due diligence norms to have any bite. States including South Korea, Canada, the United Kingdom and Australia in their report on incorporating UNGGE non-binding norms have focused on the building of institutional capacity. These have included raising awareness, creating an appropriate legislative framework, creating or strengthening departments for countering cyber threats, developing incident response plans and domestic policy, and enabling cooperative partnerships—both domestic and international. As with other due diligence obligations, the minimum baseline that is expected of States would differ based\n ibid 121.\n Ahmad (n 71) Why Botnets Persist: Designing Effective Technical and Policy Interventions, 29–31.\n Supra Section on Impact Assessment Obligations Around Botnets\n Fausto Pocar, 'New Challenges for International Rules Against Cyber-Crime' (2004) 10 European Journal on Criminal Policy and Research 27.\n Ney and Zimmermann (n 18) Cyber-Security beyond the Military Perspective: International Law, Cyberspace, and the Concept of Due Diligence.\n Coco, and de Souza Dias (n 20) 'Cyber Due Diligence': A Patchwork of Protective Obligations in International Law, 788; Russel Buchan, 'Cyberspace, Non-State Actors and the Obligation to Prevent Transboundary Harm' (2019) 21 Journal of Conflict &amp; Security Law (2016) 429, 434–439.\n ibid; ILC, Draft Articles on Prevention Article 3 [15]–[17]; Couzigou (n 62) Securing cyber space: the obligation of States to prevent harmful international cyber operations 50–51.\n Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 3 [14]–[17], Article 5.\n Pulp Mills [197].\n Andraz Kastelic, \"Due Diligence in Cyberspace: Normative Expectations of Reciprocal Protection of International Legal Rights\" (UNIDIR, 2021) <https: due-diligence-cyberspace-normative-expectations-reciprocal-protection-international=\"\" publication=\"\" www.unidir.org=\"\"> accessed 1 June 2022, 10.\n ibid.</https:>\nREVISITING DUE DILIGENCE IN CYBERSPACE\n\nThis Section attempts to provide indicators which States can follow for the process of establishing the capability to detect contemporary Botnets and conduct mitigation efforts. Such indicators would also serve to illustrate the conduct expected from States as technologies and Botnet threats evolve. Further, States are free to design their institutional baseline as long as it is adequate for the harm in question. While being mindful of capacity differentials of States, we divide these baseline measures into six categories: national/sectoral cybersecurity strategies, legal measures, measures focusing on preventing Botnet infection, on early detection of botnets, collaborative measures, and review-related measures.\n## National/Sectoral cybersecurity strategies\nStates have limited resources and regulatory capacities. Due diligence recognizes this central pillar of policymaking and accordingly, it requires states to use their best efforts based on their capabilities. To allocate their resources and the regulatory capacity in an economically efficient manner, States should create a strategy for countering threats akin to Botnets based on a risk-based approach, which would help the State identify threats and security gaps that pose a high risk and those that pose a low risk. Based on this level of risk assessment, the State can focus its resources on priority areas where high-risk vulnerabilities exist. This process can be and should ideally be performed both nationally and sectorally.\nNational cybersecurity strategies should become the cornerstone that guides State measures and initiatives. Special focus should be on strengthening and making their networks more resilient to support critical infrastructure, critical supply chains and major financial institutions. Such a National Cybersecurity strategy can also be developed based on a multi-stakeholder approach as recommended by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). As regards feasibility, the most States should be able to draw up these strategies as it only requires states to take stock of their resources, their regulatory capacity and the landscape of threats faced by them. Indeed, as of 2020, the ITU found that 127 countries out of 194 countries have now adopted a National Cyber Strategy.\n## Legal measures\nA suitable legal and regulatory framework is the bedrock of due diligence. As the ILC in their Draft Articles on Transboundary Harm notes, “[s]tates concerned shall take the necessary legislative, administrative or other action…”. The legal framework should lay out relevant rights\n Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 3 [12]–[13] 17; Coco, and de Souza Dias (n 20) Cyber Due Diligence: A Patchwork of Protective Obligations in International Law 787-88; Buchan (n 20) Cyberspace, Non-State Actors and the Obligation to Prevent Transboundary Harm 443; Bannelier-Christakis (n 20) Cyber Diligence: A Low-Intensity Due Diligence Principle for Low-Intensity Cyber Operations? 37; Couzigou (n 62) Securing cyber space: the obligation of States to prevent harmful international cyber operations 47.\n Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 3 [11].\n Coco, and de Souza Dias (n 20) Cyber Due Diligence: A Patchwork of Protective Obligations in International Law, 787-88.\n OECD, OECD Regulatory Policy Outlook 2021: Risk-based regulation (OECD Publishing, 2021).\n Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 3 [3], [5].\n ITU, 'ITU Botnet Mitigation Toolkit' (Jan 2008) ITU Telecommunication Development Sector <https: cyp=\"\" itub-cyb=\"\" cyp/ecybersecurity=\"\" docs=\"\" itu-botnet-mitigation-toolkit-background.pdf=\"\" www.itu.int=\"\"> accessed 1 July 2022, 25; Shackelford, Russell and Kuehn (n 84) Unpacking the International Law on Cybersecurity Due Diligence: Lessons from the Public and Private Sectors 34-42.\n Coco, and de Souza Dias (n 30) Cyber due diligence in international law 187-190.\n ITU (n 176) Global Cybersecurity Index 2020 145-47; ITU (n 243) Botnet Mitigation Toolkit 25.\n ibid.\n ibid.\n ibid.\n Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 5.</https:>\nABHIJEET SHRIVASTAVA AND RUDRAKSH LAKRA\nand responsibilities clearly for State and private parties, and the sanctions and remedies in case of a breach. Such a framework would provide foresight to those subject to it and promote deterrence. In connection to Botnets, any legal framework should attempt to meet two objectives: first, it should clearly criminalize the operation of a Botnet and second, it should provide tools to law enforcement, and other State bodies to effectively investigate and take enforcement actions against Botnets. Attempts at facilitating such legal frameworks can take guidance from prevailing international and regional standards.\nTurning first to criminalization, the criminalizing law should capture the range of crimes committed by Botnets; these include both ‘core’ cybercrime and ‘cyber-enabled’ crimes. States should ensure that the definition of the crimes adopted by the law should not be such that it succumbs to obsolescence very soon with technological changes. A possible approach for this is to define cyber-criminal activities at a high level of abstraction, which would also cover crimes unforeseeable at the time. This is in line with the approach in the Budapest Convention. Further in line with the Budapest Convention and other such initiatives, it is important to push for creating a uniform and common legislative baseline framework across jurisdictions, so that Botmasters could not exploit any difference in laws in different countries. In this regard, there is presently wide disagreement between States about the precise content of crimes beyond core crimes, as presently seen in ongoing debates under the UN’s auspices around a cybercrime treaty. This disagreement limits the possibility of harmonization, and thus, one hopes that a representative consensus is reached.\nRegarding the second proposed objective for laws, as Lubin explains, using existing domestic legal remedies such as injunction orders can be inappropriate for Botnet mitigation. Thus, the law should provide remedies and procedural tools which accommodate the uniqueness of cyberspace and facilitate suitable resources tailored for Botnet mitigation. The question of which procedural tools law enforcement should have can again be resolved by drawing from international standards. There is also a need to build regulatory capacity in a manner that Botnet mitigation operations could be approved at a quicker pace and the body adjudicating these requests is well versed in the specific practical and technical details. Having a quicker turnaround period is important as Botnets are constantly evolving. Consequently, responses against them can quickly become antiquated.\n Coco, and de Souza Dias (n 30) Cyber due diligence in international law 171.\n ibid.\n Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 121–22, 125, 127; ITU (n 243) Botnet Mitigation Toolkit 21–31.\n For instance see, Convention on Cybercrime (adopted 23 Nov 2001, entered into force 1 July 2004) 2296 UNTS 167; Arab Convention on Combating Information Technology Offences (adopted 21 December 2010); African Union Convention on Cyber Security and Personal Data Protection (adopted 27 June 2014); UNODC, ‘Second session of the Ad Hoc Committee’ (Second session of the Ad Hoc Committee to Elaborate a Comprehensive International Convention on Countering the Use of Information and Communications Technologies for Criminal Purposes, 2022) <https: ad_hoc_committee=\"\" chc-second-session.html=\"\" en=\"\" www.unodc.org=\"\"> accessed 1 July 2022; ITU (n 243) Botnet Mitigation Toolkit.\n Gerard (n 6) Botnet Mitigation and International Law 226.\n ibid.\n ibid.\n Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 25.\n Tomaso Falchetta, Deborah Brown and Katitza Rodriguez, ‘Opening Stages in UN Cybercrime Treaty Talks Reflect Human Rights Risks’ (Just Security, 18 April 2022) <https: 81105=\"\" apri=\"\" opening-stages-in-un-cybercrime-treaty-talks-reflect-human-rights-risks=\"\" www.justsecurity.org=\"\"></https:> accessed 30 June 2022.\n Lubin, and Marinotti (n 175) Why Current Botnet Takedown Jurisprudence Should Not Be Replicated.\n For instance see, Convention on Cybercrime (adopted 23 Nov 2001, entered into force 1 July 2004) 2296 UNTS 167; Arab Convention on Combating Information Technology Offences (adopted 21 Dec 2010); African Union Convention on Cyber Security and Personal Data Protection (adopted 27 June 2014); UNODC, ‘Second session of the Ad Hoc Committee’ (Second session of the Ad Hoc Committee to Elaborate a Comprehensive International Convention on Countering the Use of Information and Communications Technologies for Criminal Purposes, 2022) <https: ad_hoc_committee=\"\" chc-second-session.html=\"\" en=\"\" www.unodc.org=\"\"> accessed 1 July 2022; ITU (n 243) Botnet Mitigation Toolkit.\n Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 116, 126.\n ibid.</https:></https:>\nREVISITING DUE DILIGENCE IN CYBERSPACE\n\nA final observation is required for the question of the State's capacity to undertake legal and regulatory measures. Some authors have argued that all states are presumably capable of creating such a framework. However, as we highlighted in Factors affecting standard of conduct and Differential capacities for assessment techniques, even creating cybercrime legislation tailored to the threat of Botnet would require financial and technical investments. To reiterate, as of 2020, 27 countries out of 194 surveyed by ITU did not have any cybercrime-specific legislations. Moreover, even if States had cyber-specific legislations, having an adequate regulatory capacity to enforce it could be particularly challenging for LDCs and certain developing states, as discussed earlier.\n## Measures for preventing Botnet infections\nPreventive efforts against Botnets can be much more effective than combating Botnet-related threats once the Botnet mushrooms into harmful scales. If proactive measures are undertaken to this end, the creation of Botnets, and potentially their potency can be limited if and when States deploy Botnet mitigation measures as described in Mitigating or preventing Botnet-related harms. One way to limit the operation and spread of Botnets is to minimize and prevent the infection of devices. There are primarily two methods through which contemporary Botnets can infect devices—first, by exploiting the vulnerabilities in the software, hardware or firmware used by the devices or second, by social engineering.\nThe first method of propagation of malware can be limited first by regulating the suppliers of ICT products in requiring them to follow baseline security measures based on best practices. For this, States such as China, Japan, the United Kingdom, Germany, South Africa and Brazil have focused on technical standards, verification, certification or accreditation schemes. Moreover, similar to the harmonization of criminal provisions, there is a need for inter-State dialogue on global baseline security practice. This is because Botnets frequently infect devices across a tremendous number of States—for instance, the Mirai botnet infected Botnets in around 85 countries. States, particularly LDCs and developing States that do not have the\n ibid. 111.\n Coco, and de Souza Dias (n 30) Cyber due diligence in international law 137.\n Privacy International, 'Guide to International Law and Surveillance' (Privacy International, Dec 2021) <https: 2021%20gils%20version%203.0_0.pdf=\"\" default=\"\" files=\"\" sites=\"\" www.privacyinternational.org=\"\"> accessed 1 July 2022.\n Supra Sub-section on Factors Affecting Standard Of Conduct and Sub-section on Differential Capacities For Assessment Techniques.\n ITU (n 176) Global Cybersecurity Index 2020 vii.\n Supra Sub-section on Differential Capacities For Assessment Techniques.\n Ahmad (n 71) Why Botnets Persist: Designing Effective Technical and Policy Interventions, 26–27; Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 123.\n ibid.\n ibid.\n Ahmad (n 71) Why Botnets Persist: Designing Effective Technical and Policy Interventions, 26–27.\n ibid.; Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 123; ITU (n 243) Botnet Mitigation Toolkit.\n Coco, and de Souza Dias (n 30) Cyber due diligence in international law 181–186.\n ibid.\n Ahmad (n 71) Why Botnets Persist: Designing Effective Technical and Policy Interventions, 26–27.</https:>\nABHIJEET SHRIVASTAVA AND RUDRAKSH LAKRA\ncapacity to build their own security standards, can benefit from the best practices publicized by international and regional organizations. Further, the vulnerabilities in ICT products can be tackled by carrying out cybersecurity awareness campaigns that focus on end-user awareness to ensure that users keep their software and firmware up to date and install patches. Widespread adoption of baseline security practice could make it exacting for Botmasters to infect secured devices and it would limit the proportion of unsecured devices. Infecting secured devices would require more investment, and if it is more than the expected financial return, the financial incentive for Botmasters to create Botnets at all could be curtailed.\nTurning to the second manner in which Botnets generally propagate—social engineering—it is a method that involves manipulating the end users into committing errors for evading their device security. This is a psychological manipulation technique aiming to manoeuvre users into making security lapses, so as to gain unauthorised access to users' private information, devices, or valuables. However, this method too can be challenged by carrying out cybersecurity awareness campaigns that focus on building tech-literacy, particularly regarding the malware-spreading mechanisms and methods of social engineering. These campaigns should focus more on private companies as end-users, given that they have greater financial resources generally than individual end-users, and particularly small and medium enterprises which are more vulnerable.\nA capacity-building measure that would be common as a defense for both methods of Botnet propagation is conducting extensive cybersecurity awareness programs. These programs require financial bandwidth to fund campaigns, and technical expertise since trained professionals are needed to spearhead them. Comprehensive public cybersecurity campaigns are arduous for developing and LDC countries. For instance, the ITU Cybersecurity Index revealed that more than half of the countries under examination did not have any cybersecurity educational programs or training for professionals. Similarly, a study of cybersecurity awareness for users and executives in Africa found that in the surveyed countries, the lack of such awareness was a major institutional deficiency, necessitating robust programs of this nature.\n## Measures for early detection\nThe obligation of cyber capacity building toward creating a minimum institutional framework also aims at enabling States to detect threats that pose a risk of significant harm. In the case of Botnets, there is a need to create initiatives that focus on their 'early' detection. These can be worked upon by virtue of various mechanisms and initiatives, including some of the presently feasible ones we discuss hereafter.

As we have previously noted, Botnets are by their very nature transnational in scope, and due to their scale can often only be taken down by the cooperation not only between multiple States but also private parties which are involved in the takedown, such as antivirus companies, researchers, ISP and DNS providers and other tech companies. Impact assessment obligations around Botnets and Mitigating or preventing Botnet-related harms explain how conducting an impact assessment and taking mitigation or prevention measures necessitates a multi-stakeholder approach. A concomitant aim should be to build long-term and sustainable collaborations. Currently, private actors are not always given their due importance and inter-State cooperation on criminal matters is burdensome and slow as shown by contemporary mutual legal assistance processes.

Cooperation can even be used to facilitate capacity building in the form of sharing of information, and best practices.\n## Review measures\nFinally, as the ILC has noted in their Draft Articles on Transboundary Harm, “[s]tates concerned shall take the necessary...action including the establishment of suitable monitoring mechanisms to implement...” their due diligence obligations. States can first carry out a review that assesses the potential cyber risks, and the landscape of generally foreseeable threats, such as from growing technical developments. This is critical as expectant conduct under the principle of due diligence should evolve with scientific developments. Second, the review should focus on evaluating the progress the State has made regarding the goals it had set for itself in its national or sectoral cybersecurity policies. Third, the review should audit the adequacy of its overall cybersecurity infrastructure and efforts. Lastly, as the ITU recommends, the State can require entities both public and private to carry out an periodic cybersecurity audit that examines the information system’s security. This can focus on the physical configuration of the systems and software, information handling processes, user practices and environment. Again, all these suggestions must be treated as illustrations of good practices crucial for the maximal fruition of States’ due diligence obligations. We do not propose that these exact measures ought to necessarily be pursued as a matter of duty, especially given capacity differentials—however, these presently serve as some of the best possible examples of conduct the diligence of which could not reasonably be doubted. We are, therefore, hopeful for wider adoption of practices of this rigour.\n## CONCLUSION\nThrough this article, we have reaffirmed the increasing confidence in scholarly views for due diligence as a crucial means of regulating transboundary cyber operations. This faith was concretized through a unique legal and policy study of contemporary Botnets, which are among the gravest threats posed in cyberspace. That said, we demonstrated several cautions toward treating due diligence as a panacea against the Pandora’s box of harms opened by the advent of cyberspace, including for Botnets. This included evidentiary dilemmas that target States may face in proving violations of the norm, particularly given the differential standards of conduct expected of States based on their respective capacities—a nuance that we appreciated in relation to the context of the Botnet concerned, as also the State’s capacity against the specific Botnet concerned.\nYet, we also showed that many of these concerns apply to any international legal norm in the face of the novelties of this terrain. Further, due diligence connotes a spectrum of obligations for which target States may pursue the responsibility of a State of origin. This is from the very first stage of demanding that States conduct an impact assessment in the event of a preliminary\n Ahmad (n 71) Why Botnets Persist: Designing Effective Technical and Policy Interventions 27–29.\n Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 5.\n Shackelford, Russell and Kuehn (n 84) ‘Unpacking the International Law on Cybersecurity Due Diligence: Lessons from the Public and Private Sectors 41–42.\n Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 3 paras [11].\n Shackelford, Russell and Kuehn (n 84) ‘Unpacking the International Law on Cybersecurity Due Diligence: Lessons from the Public and Private Sectors 41–42; ITU (n 176) Global Cybersecurity Index 2020 146.\n ITU (n 176) Global Cybersecurity Index 2020 141.\n ibid.\nREVISITING DUE DILIGENCE IN CYBERSPACE\n\nIn presenting our claims, we have been conscious of the definitional uncertainties that the articulation of due diligence has carried with respect to the 'Corfu Channel' and 'prevention of harm' principles, including in discourse around cyberspace. Yet we argued for a novel coherent conception of due diligence that unifies these principles, providing States and cybersecurity experts much-needed clarity in understanding the scope of its obligations and trigger-thresholds for complex threats such as Botnets. We also outlined various questions with respect to each specific sub-obligation under due diligence that necessitates urgent dialogue between States. In outlining the standards of conduct expected under due diligence, we exposited scientific literature concerning contemporary Botnets, as also several instances of good practices in this context. We are conscious that those illustrations may become anachronistic as technology advances. The point, however, was largely to demonstrate—unlike thus far seen in cyberspace literature—a concrete methodology and guidelines for States to appreciate the precise rigour of diligence that would be required of them against threats like Botnets. To that extent, it is safe to presume that the relevance of these contentions will remain foregrounded for a long time.\nWhile due diligence is indeed a strong legal device to facilitate international co-operation against Botnets, the opposite is equally true. Considering not least the sheer scale of contemporary transboundary Botnets, the fullest and meaningful actualization of due diligence in cyberspace is only possible with greater international co-operation between States and private actors alike, especially for cyber capacity building. Therefore, there remains an urgent need for robust co-operative and consultative efforts against Botnets and similar threats—which in the end, would only be to the collective benefit of the entire international community at large.\n## ACKNOWLEDGEMENT\nThe authors are grateful to Professor Aman for his guidance during their study of cyberspace, and to Professor Sanskriti Sanghi for her feedback and encouragement.",

In existing scholarship, many reasons have informed growing support for the promise of 'due diligence' obligations in regulating transboundary cyber operations. We affirm this position through a study of the specific context of Botnets, although bringing much-needed caution and complexity to the discourse. We offer a comprehensive account of the standard of conduct expected of States in detecting, mitigating and preventing Botnet-linked harms under due diligence; as well as to pursue cyber capacity building toward discharging these obligations. In so doing, we problematize and elaborate on the nature of due diligence as an obligation of conduct, therefore accounting for differential State capacities against Botnet-linked harms. The paper involves attempts to unpack a coherent conception of due diligence, appreciating the spectrum of obligations that it demands, and demonstrating these nuances through an appraisal of good practices adopted by States and private actors against Botnets. Consequently, we provide a unique holistic account of how States and their law enforcement could practically understand the conduct expected of them when faced with transboundary Botnets on a case-to-case basis. In the end, while underscoring potential dilemmas within this legal regime that may be faced by target States, as also its unresolved questions, we submit that due diligence is indeed the most appropriate candidate to act as a legal arsenal against transboundary Botnets.\nKEYWORDS: cyberspace, international law, due diligence, cybersecurity, Botnets.",
    "# INTRODUCTION": "The past decades have witnessed unforeseen and unprecedented technological advancements. The advent of information communication technology (ICT) has birthed a new domain in\n© The Author(s) (2022). Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

In summary, there is no effective special law-governing inter-State conduct against cybercrime. Confusion, therefore, prevails as to the legal obligations of States around Botnets and transboundary cyber operations broadly\n² Vasileios Karagiannopoulos, *Living With Hacktivism From Conflict to Symbiosis* (Palgrave Macmillan, 2018) 1–13.\n³ Michael N.

In The relevance of due diligence for cyberspace, we offer a renewed theoretical formulation of due diligence, which is more precise and clearer than existing scholarship. Simultaneously, we consider why this formulation is appropriate for cyberspace and against Botnets. Since due diligence involves “best effort” obligations, we then dive deep into how the standard of conduct expected from each State would vary based on State cyber capacity differentials and the context of the cyber threat. This analysis in Unpacking differential standards of conduct is accompanied by our reflections on the evidentiary dilemmas that States affected by transboundary harm would face in proving breaches of due diligence.\nThereafter, we categorically elaborate the specific obligations demanded by due diligence in relation to Botnets. Triggers for due diligence obligations discuss the trigger points for the majority of due diligence obligations to become applicable. We then discuss obligations concerning the mitigation and prevention of harm that Botnets may cause to other States as well as the role of international cooperation in this regard. In Impact assessment obligations around Botnets, we analyze the obligation to conduct “impact assessments” in case of a preliminary risk of transboundary harm; and in Mitigating or preventing Botnet-related harms, we proceed to mitigation and prevention obligations, while tracing several instances of State and private-led efforts against various Botnets. Finally, we elaborate the obligation of States toward cyber capacity building against Botnet-like threats in The obligation toward cyber capacity building, with extensive discussion of good practices in that context.

    "# THE RELEVANCE OF DUE DILIGENCE FOR CYBERSPACE": "Extensive accounts of the origin and history of due diligence obligations are already present in existing literature²⁴ and will not be reiterated in this Section. Instead, in Reconceiving due diligence, we focus on providing an original and clear theoretical conception of the demands of due diligence. Following this, we briefly discuss in The preference for due diligence the reasons for scholarly confidence in due diligence obligations in the context of cyberspace.",
    "# Reconceiving due diligence": "To what end are due diligence obligations designed? Some scholars have differentiated between two allegedly distinct conceptions of due diligence: first, the 'Corfu Channel principle' as emergent from the earliest judgment of the International Court of Justice²⁵ (ICJ); and second, the 'prevention of harm principle'.²⁶ Turning to the first, the ICJ in Corfu Channel held that Albania violated international law by failing to notify British Ships that Albanian territorial waters contained a minefield.²⁷ This was even though Albania itself was not found responsible for laying the said mines.²⁸ The ICJ also held this to be in breach of the obligation \"not to knowingly allow its territory\" to be \"used for acts contrary to the rights of other States\" [emphasis ours].²⁹ Certain authors consider this to mean that due diligence is a 'standard of conduct' which attaches to \"primary\" norms, including in respecting the \"rights\" of other States.³⁰ For example, in Bosnian genocide, the ICJ held that Serbia and Montenegro violated its duty to prevent genocide in Srebrenica, by failing to exercise \"due diligence\" in using all \"all means reasonably at its disposal\".³¹ In this conception, due diligence does not create self-contained obligations, but only serves as a general rubric to measure compliance with other obligations.³²\nIn parallel, the 'prevention of harm' conception, inter alia, requires States to exercise due diligence so as to prevent or minimize \"significant\" transboundary harm to other States—when such harm originates in their territory.³³ This conception also reflects customary international law, as per the ICJ's judgments in Pulp Mills³⁴ and Nicaragua v. Costa Rica,³⁵ which concerned alleged harms to rivers. In this formulation, due diligence does contain self-contained obligations whenever there is a risk of \"significant\" harm.³⁶ Here, 'significance'\n²⁴ See generally Heike Krieger, Anne Peters, and Leonhard Kreuzer (eds), Due Diligence in the International Legal Order (OUP, 2020).\n²⁵ Coco, and de Souza Dias (n 20) Cyber Due Diligence: A Patchwork of Protective Obligations in International Law.\n²⁶ Corfu Channel (United Kingdom v.

Under the other, even otherwise unprohibited activities become unlawful when resulting in “significant harm”. What then, is the law as it stands? In their positions on how international law applies to cyberspace, many States have highlighted the Corfu Channel conception,⁴⁰ while others have supported the prevention of harm conception.⁴¹ Some have instead advanced a singular conception where both the violation of a third State’s rights and “significant harm” need to be conjunctively proven.⁴² This is also the approach of the Tallinn Manual 2.0,⁴³ thus far the most authoritative scholarly text on the law applicable to cyberspace.\nWe regret such inconsistent or incomplete formulations of due diligence by States and scholars alike. We argue that both the Corfu Channel principle and the prevention of harm principle must be construed as part and parcel of a singular due diligence norm. In our conception, due diligence requires the prevention of “significant” transboundary harm. First, when such harm is in violation of any international legal obligation, such as the duty to prevent genocide, the harm must be presumed as significant. However, as we elaborate in *Significant harms from Botnets*, only in the rare event that such an illegal act poses only inconsequential harm, due diligence obligations arguably may not be imposed on States of origin if that would cause an undue burden. Second, in the absence of inherent unlawfulness in the transboundary harm, the significance of the harm can then be examined on a case-to-case basis, using factors that we shall elaborate in Triggers for due diligence obligations. This revised conception has many benefits. One, it coheres two strands of due diligence that have both been recognized by the ICJ.⁴⁴ Two, it gives maximal clarity to States seeking to act diligently, as also to States seeking to allege violations of due diligence. Clarity is crucial for any norm to be operational in cyberspace, which is a terrain carrying its own uncertainties.⁴⁵ We therefore adopt this two-fold conception of due diligence in the following Sections.\n³⁷ Certain Activities Carried out by Nicaragua in the Border Area (Costa Rica v Nicaragua) and Construction of a Road in Costa Rica along the San Juan River (Nicaragua v Costa Rica) (Merits)  ICJ Rep 200 .\n³⁸ Coco and de Souza Dias (n 20) ‘Cyber Due Diligence’: A Patchwork of Protective Obligations in International Law, 790.\n³⁹ ibid.\n⁴⁰ Office for Disarmament Affairs, ‘Comments by Member States on the Initial Pre-Draft of the OEWG Report’ (Open-ended Working Group, 2021) <www.un.org disarmament=\"\" open-ended-working-group=\"\"></www.un.org> accessed 1 July 2022 (see individual comments from the Czech Republic and Republic of Korea).\n⁴¹ ‘President of the Republic of Estonia at the opening of CyCon 2019’ (CyCon, 29 May 2019) <https: cjefiles.s3.amazonaws.com=\"\" cgpt=\"\" pdf=\"\" cybernorms=\"\" lawstatements=\"\" remarks+by+the+president+of+the+republic+of+estonia+at+the+opening+of+cycon+2019.pdf=\"\" cech=\"\" cech_rapublic=\"\"> accessed 30 June 2022; Janne Taalas, Ambassador Finland, ‘Statement at the second session of the open-ended Working Group (OEWG) on developments in the field of information and telecommunications in the context of international security’ (Open-ended Working Group, February 2020) <https: 10=\"\" 2018=\"\" ccdcoe.org=\"\" cdc0e=\"\" ccdcoe.org.=\"\" online=\"\" opend=\"\" opend,=\"\" ut=\"\" ut.=\"\" ut.2nd-session-of-oewg.pdf=\"\" uploads=\"\" www.cdci.org=\"\"> accessed 1st July 2022; Organization of American States, ‘Improving Transparency — International Law and State Cyber Operations: Fourth Report (Presented by Prof. Duncan B.

    "# The preference for due diligence": "While some have argued that due diligence applies only in the context of international environmental law,⁴⁶ its general coverage finds support in the views of the ICJ,⁴⁷ the International Law Commission (ILC),⁴⁸ and the positions of most States that have discussed how international law applies to cyberspace.⁴⁹ We also take for granted in this article the assertion that all existing international law norms apply to cyberspace, in the absence of new opinio juris to the contrary.⁵⁰ Indeed, this is now the majority view in both scholarship and the recent positions of States.⁵¹ The question then naturally arises as to why for addressing harmful cyber operations, including Botnets, in particular, we choose to focus on due diligence when the entire spectrum of international law remains open.\nSeveral reasons justify this choice. First, consider the frequent situations where the Botnet or cyber operation is conducted by private actors. To prove the responsibility of the State where the transboundary harm originates (State of origin), the State affected by such harm (target State) would have to prove that the Botnet's operation is attributable to the State of origin.⁵² The attribution of private actions, such as this Botnet, would only arise if the stringent factual test of \"instruction, direction or control\" is met.⁵³ The test of \"instruction\" has very limited scope, while the joint test of \"direction or control\" requires proof of \"effective control\" over each allegedly wrongful act.⁵⁴ The latter test has never been successful before the ICJ, and rarely before other fora.⁵⁵ A test that is already onerous is further complicated by the immense difficulties States face in collecting digital evidence of attribution in cyberspace, given, for example, novel masking or spoofing technology.⁵⁶ Therefore, proving the violation of other norms, such as the use of force prohibition, is far from feasible⁵⁷—especially for States lacking advanced cyberinfrastructure.\n⁴⁶ Coco and de Souza Dias (n 20) 'Cyber Due Diligence': A Patchwork of Protective Obligations in International Law, 790.\n⁴⁷ Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons (Advisory Opinion)  ICJ Reps 226 ; Pulp Mills .\n⁴⁸ Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 2 , .

some authors raise the continuing debates over the thresholds of other primary norms as another reason to prefer due diligence,58 we do not exaggerate this factor—since as we shall show, concretizing due diligence, including the \"significant\" harm threshold also presents difficulties in cyberspace. Still, due diligence can operate in tandem with those primary norms that contain a preventive or positive effort aspect—such as the positive obligation to prevent genocide,59 protect human rights60 and so forth. In this respect, for failing to take measures against Botnets causing specific kinds of harm, the indirect responsibility of States can be alleged—even when the Botnets are not attributable to the State of origin.61 Furthermore, as we elaborate in Unpacking differential standards of conduct, the conduct expected in due diligence is flexible—responding to the factual context as well as the concerned State's own capacities.62 Therefore, in a terrain such as cyberspace and against the threat of Botnets—both of which are constantly and rapidly evolving, due diligence serves the advantage of accommodating advancements in technology,63 as well as imposing an equitable standard of conduct on the States based on their uneven cyber capabilities.64\nMoreover, as noted in Introduction, there are presently no treaties meaningfully addressing threats such as Botnets. This is, among other reasons, because States have thus far been unwilling to limit their freedoms in ways that may implicate their own policies; as also their hesitations given the unpredictable growths of technology. Yet even if a treaty does arise in the future, we propose that it ought to codify due diligence as aforementioned to operationalize it in cyberspace. Even if it does not, due diligence obligations would co-exist with the treaty obligations, as has been the case previously, unless the treaty provisions conflict with the custom, such that the lex specialis rule is triggered. Finally, as we argue in The obligation toward cyber capacity building, due diligence also imposes a general duty on States toward cyber capacity building, which would enhance cybersecurity worldwide. This capacity building would enable States to detect and mitigate the harms posed by transboundary Botnets, which we elaborate as their obligation in Mitigating or preventing Botnet-related harms.

It considers an in-depth examination of the implications of due diligence being an obligation of best efforts. First, we discuss a variety of factors to be considered when assessing the standard of conduct expected of States of origin based on their cyber capacity. Simultaneously, we elaborate how the factual context around a concerned cyber threat will affect the State of origin's obligations. Second, we consider if this breath of variable factors may evidently impair a target State's case that a State of origin violated its due diligence obligations. This allows a pragmatic appraisal of the obstacles to establishing State responsibility in inter-State litigation.",
    "# Factors affecting standard of conduct": "The obligation to prevent and minimize significant transboundary harm is an obligation of 'conduct' and not of 'result.' As hinted earlier, this means that due diligence requires a State of origin only to utilize the means reasonably available to it to meet this expectation, rather than succeeding at preventing or minimizing harm. Thus, the obligations imposed on States of origin are commensurate with their wherewithal—i.e., their cybersecurity capacities comprising financial, technical and institutional resources.\nConsider the question of technical means. The most prevalent forms of Botnets involve a 'command and control' server which sends instructions to Bots from specific web domains. One method of disabling a Botnet is \"sinkholing\"—here, law enforcement takes control of these web domains, and redirects the Bot traffic to severs under their control. When the Dutch police took over the Bredolab Botnet in 2010, it employed this method and used its server to notify all affected users that their devices had been compromised. Could one then assume that whenever a Botnet emerges, with the Botmaster operating the command server in The Netherlands, the Dutch police can be presumed to have the means to sinkhole the Botnet? The answer is in negative.\nFor example, several Botmasters have employed techniques to generate mass false domain names, owing to which locating the command server becomes arduous. In such cases, concerns arise as to collisions with legitimate domains when law enforcement attempts to target malicious domains. In addition, as seen in the Mariposa Botnet takedown by Spanish authorities, not all Botnets use \"static malware\", meaning that Botmasters can often update the code of the malware infecting devices so as to prevent detection of the Botnet itself. This is why despite several apparently successful attempts at taking down the Kelihos Botnet, it continued to\n66 Koivurova (n 30) Due Diligence, –.\n69 Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 3 , .\n70 For this reason, some authors characterize due diligence as an obligation of 'common but differentiated responsibility' (CBDR). However, we avoid this term given its specific connotation in climate change law – where specific obligations are imposed on legally defined \"developed\" countries to assist the capacity-building of \"developing\" countries. As to capacity-building in cyberspace, see Section on Impact Assessment Obligations Around Botnets.

These limited factors suffice to show that at times the very detection of a Botnet may surpass the technical capabilities of a State, let alone a takedown process. Thus, in the absence of knowledge of the Botnet's existence, the obligation to prevent transboundary harm would not even be triggered,79 as we elaborate in Triggers for due diligence obligations.\nWe harp on two points here. First, cybersecurity capacities vary drastically across States.80 The same conduct cannot generally be expected between so-called \"developed\" countries, \"developing\" and \"least developed\" (LDC) countries;81 or even between countries in comparable socio-economic brackets or the same region—given that their cyber capacities against particular threats can differ substantially.82 Second, to reiterate, due diligence requires highly factual assessments.83 Thus, to allege violations of due diligence, target States would have to prove that the concerned State of origin possessed the capacity to detect, mitigate or prevent transboundary Botnet-related harm in relation to the specific Botnet at hand.84\nDespite differences of capacity, some authors argue that there are certain measures for which any State should be presumed as capable—by the very virtue of being a State, such as the creation of legislations to penalize cybercrime.85 However, even the creation of regulations and corresponding enforcement agencies requires financial and technical investments.86 Therefore, the contents, scope and effectiveness of such domestic regimes may vary depending on State capacity, without violating due diligence. Therefore, one must be cautious when asserting any supposedly universal expectations under due diligence. At the same time, as State capacity advances, the standard of diligent conduct would also advance commensurably.87 Hence, if a State previously lacking cybercrime police, Botnet detection or mitigation techniques later\n77 Arsh Arora, 'Kelihos Botnet: A Never-Ending Saga' (Annual ADFSL Conference on Digital Forensics, Security and Law, 2017). <https: commons.erau.edu=\"\" cgi=\"\" cgi?viewcontent.cgi?article=\"1271&amp;context=adfsl\"> accessed 1 July 2022 9.\n78 Ahmad (n 71) Why Botnets Persist: Designing Effective Technical and Policy Interventions 9.\n79 Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 3 para  and ; Coco and de Souza Dias (n 20) 'Cyber Due Diligence': A Patchwork of Protective Obligations in International Law, 793–94.\n80 International Telecommunications Union, Global Cybersecurity Index 2020 Measuring commitment to cybersecurity (ITU Publications 2020); Andrea Calderaro and Anthony J.

Yet one is compelled to wonder if the evidentiary burden of a State to prove these variable factors may become self-defeating, negating the promising potential of due diligence in establishing State responsibility.\n## Evidentiary concerns\nIn proving the aforementioned facts, three considerations must be examined separately: the 'burden', 'method' and 'standard' of proof.⁸⁸ The burden of proof concerns whether certain facts must be proven by a particular party—as per the ICJ, the party alleging due diligence violations must prove the necessary facts.⁸⁹ The method of proving facts can either comprise direct or indirect evidence. In Nicaragua v. Costa Rica, the ICJ showed preference for direct scientific evidence, at least on the question of whether the harm alleged over the San Huan river was \"significant\".⁹⁰ Yet in Corfu Channel, the ICJ allowed \"liberal recourse\" to inferences from indirect (circumstantial) evidence proving Albania's knowledge of the placing of mines on its territory.⁹¹ This was because any direct evidence would have been in Albania's exclusive control.⁹² Analogizing, some authors argue that States litigating against cyber operations would face similar evidentiary obstacles, and thus, courts should be amenable to circumstantial digital evidence.⁹³\nHowever, even so, in Corfu Channel, the ICJ only found for the United Kingdom since its set of indirect evidence left \"no room for reasonable doubt\".⁹⁴ This is the 'standard' of proof—i.e., the extent to which the Court must be persuaded as to the existence of facts.⁹⁵ In later cases where the opposing State's direct evidence contradicted the available circumstantial evidence, this standard was not met for the ICJ.⁹⁶ This, in effect means that if States of origin are able to provide direct evidence contradicting the indirect evidence of target States on any count, the latter's case would likely fall. Crucially moreover, in Bosnian Genocide, the Court held that it would apply a higher standard of proof for charges of \"exceptional gravity\"—in that case, concerning the genocide prohibition.⁹⁷ With regard to proving due diligence allegations on factual significant harm in se, the Court has not indicated a precise standard of proof.⁹⁸ Yet at least for cases where applicant States found their submissions on due diligence as a measure of compliance for primary norms, the standards of proof may shift based on the \"gravity\" of the allegations.⁹⁹\nFinally, it should be acknowledged that the ICJ in Pulp Mills was asked by Argentina to grant similar flexibilities as in Corfu Channel; although the Court found no need to inquire into the request since it did not consider Argentina evidentially disadvantaged.¹⁰⁰ Moreover, to reiterate,\n⁸⁸ Michael P.

It appears unlikely, however, that the Court would depart from its previous approaches.¹⁰²\nConsidering all this, and in light of the differential facts to be proven for asserting a specific standard of conduct as per the previous Sub-Section, one may be inclined to conclude that proving due diligence violations is in fact more difficult than for other norms—contrary to our view in The relevance of due diligence for cyberspace. While these challenges are certainly formidable, we hesitate to dismiss our preference for due diligence. First, the high standard of proof applied to presentations of circumstantial evidence would affect submissions on any norm violation in cyberspace, not just due diligence.¹⁰³ This would include attempts to attribute private actions to States of origin, the tests for which are in any case extremely stringent.¹⁰⁴ Accordingly and second, due diligence would help avoid impunity by facilitating indirect responsibility at least in certain cases.¹⁰⁵ This is especially for cases where the State of origin manifestly takes none or negligible efforts against the private group¹⁰⁶—i.e., it enabled the Botnet's administration by its unwillingness to act for whatever reason.\nTo reiterate, it could be difficult to prove violations of due diligence expectations that heavily hinge on State capacity (such as Botnet takedowns).¹⁰⁷ Perhaps, even proving the \"risk\" of \"significant\" harm could pose difficulties, as we discuss in Triggers for due diligence obligations. Nevertheless, there would be recourse at least when States of origin attempt unilateral measures against Botnets that could have potential impacts on other States. The target State could argue that a prior \"impact assessment\" should necessarily be held—so as to examine if \"significant\" harm may result from the measure.¹⁰⁸ Indeed, in Nicaragua v. Costa Rica, the ICJ found that Costa Rica violated this procedural requirement, even though it also considered that there was no risk of significant harm at the time.¹⁰⁹ As we elaborate in Impact Assessment Obligations Around Botnets, it is arguable that in conducting such impact assessments, the potentially affected States must be consulted, thus maximizing inter-State cooperation. In any case, when a risk of significant harm is found, the obligation to notify and co-operate with the other States would be triggered.¹¹⁰ Albania's omission to respect this very obligation was what entitled the United Kingdom for full compensation for the damage inflicted on its warships.¹¹¹ Therefore,\n¹⁰¹ Alan Boyle, 'Developments in the International Law of Environmental Impact Assessments and their Relation to the Espoo Convention' (2011) 20 Review of European Community &amp; International Environmental Law, 227.\n¹⁰² Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Croatia v.

In any case, the differential standard of conduct it imposes also protects the interests of States for whom higher expectations would have formed an \"undue burden\".¹¹³ Thus, on balance, this regime should remain until and unless distinct opinio juris arises in this regard. This backdrop having been set; we now turn to the spectrum of due diligence obligations specifically applicable to the context of Botnets.",
    "# TRIGGERS FOR DUE DILIGENCE OBLIGATIONS": "This Section elaborates two conditions for different obligations under due diligence to apply: first, that the risk of harm should be significant, and second, that the State of origin must possess 'knowledge' of such risk. The first difficulty arises in defining which forms of harms posed by Botnets would be \"significant\".",
    "# Significant harms from Botnets": "As regards factual significant harm, the ILC has argued that assessments of harm must be amenable to \"fast evolving technology\".¹¹⁴ While declining to provide clear metrics for measuring \"significance\", it argued that such harm can be somewhere between \"detectable and substantial\"—including harm to persons, property or the environment.¹¹⁵ As we shall elaborate, Botnets may cause tangible or intangible harm, to hardware, software, data and persons.¹¹⁶ A two-fold inquiry may be carried out concerning intrinsic or instrumental harm—for example, the ICJ examined whether the discharge of sediments into the San Huan river could in itself amount to significant harm against Nicaraguan territory, or if it could cause consequences amounting to such harm, such as the extinction of its fish species.¹¹⁷ In examining this, the Court considered the scale, magnitude and context of Costa Rica's road construction project.¹¹⁸\nThe first acknowledgement then is that not every Botnet is as such harmful—for instance, their use might be for innocuous purposes not amounting to harm, or at a low \"scale\".¹¹⁹ Theoretically, it is possible that despite infecting millions of devices (having a high scale), the Botnet only spreads harmless spam (having little magnitude), or that the devices are clearly secure against the effects the Botnets seeks to cause (in the context of these devices, it does not pose a risk of harm).¹²⁰ Yet it is also possible that despite infecting only a few hundred devices, it may cause\n¹¹² ILC Articles on Responsibility of States Articles 31, 34–38.\n¹¹³ Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 3 , , , , , ; Coco and de Souza Dias (n 20) 'Cyber Due Diligence': A Patchwork of Protective Obligations in International Law, 787-88; Buchan (n 20) Cyberspace, Non-State Actors and the Obligation to Prevent Transboundary Harm 443; Bannelier-Christakis (n 20) Cyber Diligence: A Low-Intensity Due Diligence Principle for Low-Intensity Cyber Operations? 37; Couzigou (n 62) Securing cyber space: the obligation of States to prevent harmful international cyber operations 47.\n¹¹⁴ Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 3 .\n¹¹⁵ Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 2 .\n¹¹⁶ Coco and de Souza Dias (n 20) 'Cyber Due Diligence': A Patchwork of Protective Obligations in International Law 793.\n¹¹⁷ Certain Activities Carried out by Nicaragua in the Border Area (Costa Rica v Nicaragua) and Construction of a Road in Costa Rica along the San Juan River (Nicaragua v Costa Rica) (Merits)  ICJ Rep 200 , –.\n¹¹⁸ ibid. ,\n¹¹⁹ Ahmad (n 71) Why Botnets Persist: Designing Effective Technical and Policy Interventions 7–8.\n¹²⁰ The ICJ has previously examined whether the object in question would indeed be prone to a harmful impact; see Pulp Mills .\nREVISITING DUE DILIGENCE IN CYBERSPACE\n333\nharm of alarming proportions—as evident from the Stuxnet worm which interfered with the workings of Iranian nuclear power plants.¹²¹ Suppose that a Botnet is used to launch cyber-attacks with physical effects, where it aims to render the critical infrastructure of a State dysfunctional—the case for such effects as intrinsically significantly harmful is evident.¹²² Indeed, in Nicaragua v. Costa Rica, the Court did indicate that when the harm to an object passes a “sort of critical level”,¹²³ the harm could be significant—integrity is the least controversial measure of this regard.\nThe assessment of intrinsic harm is complicated when the effects take other forms, such as against the confidentiality of the data of the device.¹²⁴ Consider the Corfu Channel conception of due diligence, which we argued in The relevance of due diligence for cyberspace as attaching due diligence to other primary norms (a violation of another international norm is presupposed as \"significant harm\"). The breach of confidentiality could involve the leak, deletion, or threats to interfere with data.¹²⁵ Some authors consider all such intrusions as arbitrary interferences with the primary norm of the right to privacy.¹²⁶ Others argue that States' positive obligation to protect human rights (which would include privacy) is one of due diligence.¹²⁷ Yet others contend, though not without opponents,¹²⁸ that this obligation applies extraterritorially—i.e., a State of origin would owe it to affected device-holders present in the target State.¹²⁹ Reading these views together, could one argue that every Botnet that affects the confidentiality of devices attracts the State of origin's due diligence obligations? While technically arguable, it could impose an undue burden on States given the sheer frequency of \"low-intensity\" cyber operations¹³⁰—and go against the logic that negligible harm is excluded from due diligence.¹³¹ This dilemma, in informal terms, puts due diligence in an awkward position.\nThe analysis would perhaps be clearer depending on the nature of the data, whether it forms part of \"critical\" infrastructure,¹³² the scale of mass data deletion; or to come to \"instrumental\" harms, the concrete effects on human life and property resulting from the Botnet—such as causing financial losses,¹³³ the rigging of ballot machines to distort votes,¹³⁴ manipulating stock markets by using algorithmic trading from the Bots,¹³⁵ spreading hate speech on mass scales to\n¹²¹ Kim Zetter, 'An Unprecedented Look at Stuxnet, the World's First Digital Weapon' (Wired, 3 Nov 2014) <https: 11=\"\" 2014=\"\" countdown-to-zero-day-stuxnet=\"\" www.wired.com=\"\"></https:> accessed 15 May 2022.\n¹²² David Kushner, 'The Real Story of Stuxnet' (IEE Spectrum, 23 February 2013) <https: spectrum.ieee.org=\"\" the-real-story-of-stuxnet=\"\" the-real-story-of-stuxnet=\"\"></https:> accessed 1 July 2022; Saleh Soltan, Prateek Mittal, and H.

Yet even instrumental effects would require close attention in particular cases. For example, whether mass disinformation campaigns run through Botnets, in the context of pandemics,¹³⁷ elections¹³⁸ or otherwise could be considered “significant” would necessarily depend on the facts and empirics of each case.¹³⁹ Such factors could include the scale of the Botnet, the nature of the disinformation, and the social context at hand.¹⁴⁰\nFrom this long discussion, we conclude the following. First, that a variety of distinct cyber threats posed by Botnets may give rise to risks of significant transboundary harm. Second, at the same time, it is crucial for States to elaborate their views on what forms of cyber threats they consider as such harms, whether intrinsically or instrumentally, given that many cases presently involve ambiguity. Third, in any case, the examination of a risk of significant harm would necessarily be a case-to-case basis test. The same goes for the potential effects of any response measures that States of origin may wish to take against transboundary Botnets, which we elaborate in Mitigating or preventing Botnet-related harms. These complications are why, in Impact assessment obligations around Botnets, we emphasize the need for respecting the obligation¹⁴¹ to conduct an “impact assessment” to examine if significant harm may arise from Botnet response measures that could potentially affect other States.",
    "# The state of origin's knowledge": "It is crucial that a great majority of due diligence obligations: that to notify potentially affected States of the risk of significant harm from private or its own activities; and to co-operate with them in order to mitigate, minimize or prevent such harm, all take for granted that the State of origin knows of the existence of this risk.¹⁴² Such knowledge can be either actual or constructive, the latter meaning that in the circumstances of a case, a diligent State ought to or can be presumed to have known of the risk.¹⁴³ As examples, in Corfu Channel, the constant surveillance of Albanian forces close to areas where mines were placed indicated its constructive knowledge as to the presence of the mines;¹⁴⁴ while in Bosnian Genocide, the fact that international bodies and other States continually expressed concerns that genocide may transpire was taken to prove Serbia and Montenegro's constructive knowledge to that effect.¹⁴⁵ Thus, for example, a State of origin's knowledge can be presumed if its own cyber infrastructure was frequently exploited by the private Botnet.¹⁴⁶ Alternatively, as has often been the case,¹⁴⁷ if the target State, other States or private actors publicize the existence of a harmful Botnet, the aforesaid obligations of the State of origin would activate.\n¹³⁶ Coco, and de Souza Dias (n 30) Cyber due diligence in international law 77; HRC, 'Report of the independent international fact-finding mission on Myanmar' (12 September 2018) UN Doc.

In the absence of such capacity, neither would the State of origin be capable of apprising itself as to Botnet risks, nor could constructive knowledge be realistically imputed to it.¹⁴⁸ In that event, some have speculated that States may use their capacity deficiencies as excuses to evade the above spectrum of obligations.¹⁴⁹ We address this dilemma later in The obligation toward cyber capacity building of the article, where we submit that due diligence obligates continuous State efforts toward cyber capacity building. In the next Section, we discuss the obligation of States of origin to conduct impact assessments in order to secure knowledge of any risks of significant Botnet-related transboundary harm from their territory.",
    "# IMPACT ASSESSMENT OBLIGATIONS AROUND BOTNETS": "In Triggers for due diligence obligations, we outlined the trigger thresholds for the majority of due diligence obligations to apply for a State of origin—knowledge, and the risk of significant transboundary harm. Later in Mitigating or preventing Botnet-related harms, we finally address the specific conduct expected of States of States once the trigger thresholds described in Triggers for due diligence obligations are met.\nHowever, before that stage, we begin in this Section by unpacking the earlier stage where there is a preliminary risk of harm to other States—yet it remains uncertain whether the risked harm could be \"significant\". In such situations, we argue that States of origin must conduct impact assessments to examine whether there is a risk of \"significant\" harm from the Botnet or their response measures. First, we outline the contents of the obligation to conduct impact assessments as also an inexhaustive list of factors that these assessments should consider against contemporary Botnets. Second, we discuss impact assessment techniques employed by States thus far and their interplay with differential State capacities. Finally, we elaborate certain miscellaneous questions as to the scope of this obligation that require the urgent attention of States.",
    "# Setting the law and context": "The ICJ has recognized that in case of a preliminary risk of harm, States are customarily bound to conduct impact assessments to discover if the concerned harm could be \"significant\".¹⁵⁰ If such a risk becomes apparent, the State of origin must notify and consult the potentially affected States and take measures to mitigate the potential harm.¹⁵¹ Upon discovering suspicious Botnets, a \"preliminary risk\" of this nature must be presupposed given their inherent potential for malicious uses, as described in Significant Harms From Botnets. There is also a frequent affirmation of the need for prior impact assessments in cyberspace.¹⁵² For example, in reference to due diligence, the Council of Europe considers that States must assess if a \"disruption or interference\n¹⁴⁸ Buchan (n 20) Cyberspace, Non-State Actors and the Obligation to Prevent Transboundary Harm 443; Bannelier-Christakis (n 20) Cyber Diligence: A Low-Intensity Due Diligence Principle for Low-Intensity Cyber Operations? 37; Couzigou (n 62) Securing cyber space: the obligation of States to prevent harmful international cyber operations 47.\n¹⁴⁹ O.

Indeed, without proper vigilance, States of origin could inadvertently harm the integrity and functionality of foreign devices, which may even include other States' critical digital infrastructure.¹⁵⁶\nThe ICJ appreciates that States have discretion in deciding the exact modalities of these impact assessments; however, the assessment must account for the \"nature and magnitude\" of the transboundary activity, its likely adverse impact on States, and the need to \"exercise due diligence\" in its conduct.¹⁵⁷ The ILC has taken a similar position, while elaborating that the likely effects on persons, property and environment of the States should be considered,¹⁵⁸ as we described in Significant harms from Botnets. In any event, the assessment should be rooted in \"scientific\" evidence.¹⁵⁹ Based on these legal compulsions and our research on contemporary Botnets, the following are some inexhaustive factors that could inform an effective impact assessment. Needless to add, future Botnets may evolve such that these factors prove inadequate to examine their activities.¹⁶⁰ Our analysis only serves to illustrate the rigor that ought to be expected from States.\nFirst, examining the 'size' of the Botnet (the number of Bots) can indicate the potency of its threat and its unique geographical spread,¹⁶¹ which may necessitate international co-operation. Relatedly, determining the locations of foreign devices can enable measures such as notifying users in order to remove malwares from the devices.¹⁶² Second, inquiring the precise activities pursued by the Botnets can indicate the nature of harm they could cause, as described in Significant harms from Botnets. In fact, Botnets are frequently used to earn revenue by illegal activities such as mass spam or theft.¹⁶³ Thus, to meaningfully counter the threat of Botnets in the long-term, it is imperative to cut such streams of revenue that serve as incentives\n¹⁵³ Council of Europe, 'Recommendation CM/Rec (2011)8 of the Committee of Ministers to member states on the protection and promotion of the universality, integrity and openness of the Internet' (21 September 2011) <https: cm=\"\" pages=\"\" result_details.aspx?objectid=\"09000016805cc2f8\" search.coe.int=\"\"> accessed 1st July 2022; Council of Europe, 'Explanatory Memorandum to the draft Recommendation CM/Rec(2011)... of the Committee of Ministers to member states on the protection and promotion of Internet's universality, integrity and openness', (CM Documents, CM(2011)115–add1, 24 August 2011) <https: cm=\"\" pages=\"\" result_details.aspx?objectid=\"09000016805ccaeb\" search.coe.int=\"\"> accessed 1 July 2022 .\n¹⁵⁴ ibid.\n¹⁵⁵ Stockburger (n 104) Control and Capabilities Test: Toward a New Lex Specialis Governing State Responsibility for Third Party Cyber Incidents 259–60.\n¹⁵⁶ Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 90.\n¹⁵⁷ Pulp Mills ; Certain Activities Carried out by Nicaragua in the Border Area (Costa Rica v Nicaragua) and Construction of a Road in Costa Rica along the San Juan River (Nicaragua v Costa Rica) (Merits)  ICJ Rep 200 .\n¹⁵⁸ Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 7 –.\n¹⁵⁹ Boyle (n 101) Developments in the International Law of Environmental Impact Assessments and their Relation to the Espoo Convention 230.\n¹⁶⁰ Mayra Rosario Fuentes and other, 'The Future of P2P IoT Botnets' (Trend Micro, 11 March 2021) <https: 21=\"\" en_in=\"\" ec=\"\" c=\"\" the-future-of-p2p-iot-botnets.html=\"\" research=\"\" www.trendmicro.com=\"\"> accessed 1 July 2022; Ben Dickson, 'IoT botnets might be the cybersecurity industry's next big worry' (IOT Security Foundation, 12 July 2016) <https: 07=\"\" 12=\"\" 2016=\"\" bdtechtalks.com=\"\" iot-botnets-might-be-the-cybersecurity-industrys-next-big-worry=\"\"></https:> accessed 1 July 2022; Shailaja Shankar, 'Ghosts of Botnets Past, Present, and Future' (McAfee, 17 December 2018) <https: blogs=\"\" internet-security=\"\" ghosts-of-botnets-past-present-and-future=\"\" www.mcafee.com=\"\"></https:> accessed 1 July 2022.\n¹⁶¹ Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 26–28.\n¹⁶² BBC (n 73); Zeitlin (n 72) Botnet Takedowns and the Fourth Amendment, 753–754.\n¹⁶³ Ogu and others (n 10) A Botnets Circumspection: The Current Threat Landscape, and What We Know So Far 11–12.</https:></https:></https:>\nREVISITING DUE DILIGENCE IN CYBERSPACE\n337\nfor Botmasters¹⁶⁴—which can only be made possible by this second measure. Third, securing information on the method of propagation of the Botnet and other technicalities such as its malware can assist law enforcement in halting and preventing its spread in the future.¹⁶⁵ Finally, the architecture and communication protocol of the Botnet must be ascertained to understand the appropriate methods to eradicate the Botnet, as also the likely effects of such methods on affected devices.¹⁶⁶ This is of course not to suggest that these factors are to be universally followed, since the extent of diligence expected from States varies with their respective capacities.¹⁶⁷ We turn to this dilemma in the next Sub-Section.\n## Differential capacities for assessment techniques\nOperationalizing the aforementioned factors requires recourse to one or a combination of various methods—categorized as ‘passive’ or ‘active’ techniques.¹⁶⁸ On the facts of each Botnet, one technique might be more strategically appropriate than the other.¹⁶⁹ Passive techniques are relatively stealthier and do not interfere with the Botnets directly,¹⁷⁰ such as analysis of spam records, and anti-virus software feedback;¹⁷¹ though we do not elaborate all such techniques in this article. Active techniques in contrast are relatively more intrusive but offer greater accuracy and reliability in their findings.¹⁷² In construing ‘diligence’, States possessing capacities to deploy either forms of technique may be obligated to determine and utilize the technique most appropriate against a particular Botnet, or at least attempt to do so.\nAn example of active technique is the method of sinkholing—which involves the redirection of Bots from the Botmaster’s malicious domain servers to law enforcement-controlled domain servers.¹⁷³ This technique, which is also characterized as a Domain Name System (DNS) approach, takes for granted that States have a certain amount of technical and financial resources.¹⁷⁴ It also necessitates cooperation with DNS operators, most of whom would be private actors; in the event of their refusal to co-operate, sinkholing can only be pursued if the operators can be legally compelled to that end.¹⁷⁵ Yet that takes for granted the presence of a legal framework that criminalizes cybercriminal acts such as Botnets, enabling the State to compel co-operation. As recently as 2020, it was found in a survey of 194 countries that around 27 countries do not even possess such laws.¹⁷⁶ The situation is worsened in the event that the DNS operator, service provider or corporation is not subject to the State of origin’s enforcement jurisdiction—in which case co-operation with other States would also have to be pursued to proceed.¹⁷⁷ Evidently, toward States of origin presently lacking these necessary capacities, it would be an “undue burden” to expect sophisticated sinkholing techniques. Even in respect of passive techniques such as analyses of spam records, there is a need for certain minimal capacities for\n¹⁶⁴ Ahmad (n 71) Why Botnets Persist: Designing Effective Technical and Policy Interventions 29–31.\n¹⁶⁵ Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 30–31.\n¹⁶⁶ Ogu and others (n 10) A Botnets Circumspection: The Current Threat Landscape, and What We Know So Far 9.\n¹⁶⁷ Supra Sub-section Factors Affecting Standard Of Conduct\n¹⁶⁸ Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 40–78.\n¹⁶⁹ ibid. 40–53, 77–78.\n¹⁷⁰ ibid.\n¹⁷¹ ibid.\n¹⁷² ibid. 53–65, 77–78.\n¹⁷³ ibid. 54–57; Zeitlin (n 72) Botnet Takedowns and the Fourth Amendment 753–754.\n¹⁷⁴ Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 76.\n¹⁷⁵ ibid. 76, 109–110; Asaf Lubin, and João Marinotti, ‘Why Current Botnet Takedown Jurisprudence Should Not Be Replicated’ (Lawfare, 21 Wed 2021) <https: \"bulletproof\"=\"\" 1=\"\" 2022;=\"\" 21=\"\" 2022;=\"\" 2022;=\"\" 21=\"\" 471,=\"\" 471.=\"\" 71.=\"\" <https:=\"\" ag=\"\" alishanda-ransomware-banking-trojans-information-stealers=\"\" blog=\"\" bulletproof-hosting-yalishanda-ransomware-banking-trojans-information-stalers»=\"\" http:=\"\" infel471.com=\"\" international=\"\" international=\"\" infel4711=\"\" blog=\"\" telecommunications=\"\" union,=\"\" www.lawfareblog.com=\"\"> accessed 1 May 2022.\n¹⁷⁶ International Telecommunications Union, Global Cybersecurity Index 2020 Measuring commitment to cybersecurity (ITU Publications 2020) vii.\n¹⁷⁷ Lubin (n 45) The Prohibition on Extraterritorial Enforcement Jurisdiction in the Datasphere.</https:>\nABHIJEET SHRIVASTAVA AND RUDRAKSH LAKRA\nfiltering out malicious content from benign content.¹⁷⁸ Such capacities, in turn, would most likely be uneven across States, especially those within the LDC group.¹⁷⁹\nA related factor is that the pursuit of impact assessment methods as described above often requires high technical know-how, for which past experiences in tackling Botnets are crucial.¹⁸⁰ An accepted indicator of these capabilities is whether a State possesses a National or Sectoral Cyber Incident Response Team (CIRT), which fosters a coordinated cybersecurity ecosystem in the State.¹⁸¹ However, as of 2020, over 63 States did not have National level CIRTs and faced significant barriers in establishing them, given resource deficiencies in institutional knowledge, skills shortages and other factors—especially for LDCs.¹⁸² This strengthens the case¹⁸³ for international co-operation between States and private actors alike in capacity-building and intelligence sharing for improving cybersecurity. In the end, this would benefit not only less capable States, but also the international community at large—as capacity-building would enable the former to better discharge their obligations as States of origin, as we shall argue in The obligation toward cyber capacity building. To reiterate, as the technological capabilities of States advance, the rigour expected in their impact assessments would also increase under due diligence.¹⁸⁴ By the same metric, if Botnet threats advance further beyond a State's renewed capabilities, the State would not be faulted for ineffective impact assessments as long as it invests its best efforts.¹⁸⁵\n## Miscellaneous debates\nBefore proceeding to the next Section on the specific obligations to mitigate and prevent Botnet-related harms, we consider it crucial to outline three unresolved questions as to the scope of the impact assessment obligation. First, some authors have argued for a universal obligation on States to conduct continuous 'monitoring' against cyber threats such as Botnets under due diligence.¹⁸⁶ Seemingly, this connects to the impact assessment stage. In our view, other scholars are correct in responding that general monitoring falls outside its scope,¹⁸⁷ since the obligation is only triggered in the event of a \"preliminary risk\" of harm.¹⁸⁸ Others further argue that this would pose capacity concerns even for developed States, or at least difficulties in making such monitoring conform to human rights safeguards.¹⁸⁹ Yet we further submit that general monitoring\n¹⁷⁸ Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 71–73; Do Le Quoc, André Martin, and Christof Fetzer, 'Scalable and Real-Time Deep Packet Inspection' (IEEE/ACM 6th International Conference on Utility and Cloud Computing, 2013) 446–451.\n¹⁷⁹ Generally, see footnote 191.\n¹⁸⁰ Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 72–74.\n¹⁸¹ ITU (n 176) Global Cybersecurity Index 2020 131–134.\n¹⁸² ibid. 7.\n¹⁸³ Ahmad (n 71) Why Botnets Persist: Designing Effective Technical and Policy Interventions 31–35.\n¹⁸⁴ Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 3 , , , , , ; Coco, and de Souza Dias (n 20) 'Cyber Due Diligence': A Patchwork of Protective Obligations in International Law 787–88; Buchan (n 20) Cyberspace, Non-State Actors and the Obligation to Prevent Transboundary Harm 443; Bannelier-Christakis (n 20) Cyber Diligence: A Low-Intensity Due Diligence Principle for Low-Intensity Cyber Operations? 37.\n¹⁸⁵ ibid.\n¹⁸⁶ O.

The issue, however, is that necessity imposes a stringent test, one that has never been met before the ICJ. In this vein, there could be cases where States of origin fail the obligation to conduct impact assessments for reasons that are legitimate but fall below necessity. The ICJ was asked in Nicaragua v. Costa Rica to find that an \"emergency\" situation could preclude the obligation of holding impact assessments;¹⁹³ however, the Court avoided this legal question by factually finding that there were no circumstances resembling an emergency.¹⁹⁴ This, therefore, remains a question that ought to be debated and clarified by States in their positions on cyber-law or a future treaty on the subject.\nFinally, it is accepted that once a risk of \"significant\" harm is determined, the State of origin must co-operate and consult potentially affected States in good faith.¹⁹⁵ Yet some consider that inter-State co-operation is crucial even during the prior stage of impact assessments.¹⁹⁶ The basis for this assertion is that an accurate examination of the likely harms cannot be facilitated without co-operation from affected States, given their position to directly appreciate the risk posed to their territory¹⁹⁷—here, foreign devices infected by the Botnet. This question too was raised in the case of Nicaragua v. Costa Rica but avoided by the ICJ on grounds of judicial economy.¹⁹⁸ Given the ramifications of this question, we hope to see clearer articulations from States as to their co-operation obligations concerning threats such as Botnets. That said, we now turn to the spectrum of obligations triggered once a risk of significant harm does in fact arise.",
    "# MITIGATING OR PREVENTING BOTNET-RELATED HARMS": "To reiterate once again, States of origin must use all means at their disposal to prevent or mitigate harm to target States emanating from the former's territory.¹⁹⁹ This due diligence obligation would arise either upon the State's own impact assessment or by constructive knowledge as\n¹⁹⁰ General monitoring which entails deep packet inspection at scale requires significant computing power.

The mitigating measures the State must take depend on the nature of the harm (including its \"seriousness\" and \"likelihood\"²⁰⁰), the State's capacity, and other circumstances of the case.²⁰¹ The harm in question may result from either the Botnet itself, or through response measures taken by the State of origin against the Botnet. We do not propose that there are specific forms of measures that are universal expectations against any and all Botnets. The purpose of this Section is only to provide an account of contemporary mitigating measures that in our view serve as good practices that depending on the facts, could likely meet the States' due diligence obligations. Like before, we also acknowledge capacity differentials in the discussion.\nWe consider five forms of measures that together could entirely mitigate Botnet-related harms: first, the takeover or takedown of the Botnet, second, the subsequent clean-up of infected devices, third, the fixing of software or hardware vulnerabilities that allowed the Botnet's propagation, fourth, the arrest and prosecution of the Botmaster, and finally, efforts against any financial incentives that may have led to the creation of the Botnets.\nBeginning categorically, the takedown of Botnets involves identifying the gaps in the Botnet's functioning and architecture to thereafter disable or bring it down.²⁰² This measure requires tremendous technical and financial wherewithal as it involves a specialized response to each unique Botnet;²⁰³ it is challenging even for developed States and major private corporations.²⁰⁴ Despite this, it might only provide a fleeting control since the Botmaster would resist takedowns using defence and contingencies.²⁰⁵ Given this, Microsoft's takedowns have failed so often that it has begun instead referring to these attempts as Botnet \"disruptions\".²⁰⁶ To illustrate further, Microsoft botched its attempt to takedown the ZeroAccess Botnet owing to its omission to account for the P2P structure of the Botnet, meaning that the malware on devices was self-executing—and did not respond to a command server.²⁰⁷ Alternatively, Botnets can often have multiple command servers, and the failure to eradicate all such servers has previously enabled their resurgence.²⁰⁸ Clearly, the nature, architecture and protocols of the Botnet could necessitate careful strategies. Thus, it would be absurd to consider Botnet takedowns or takeovers as a universal expectation from even States of origin with high cyber capabilities, let alone developing States and LDCs. There is a need for inter-State and private-State cooperation for collective capacity-building efforts in this regard.\nAs to the second measure, even if a State of origin somehow manages to takedown Botnets—it should attempt to disinfect or clean the malware left on affected devices if the State possesses the necessary capacity. This is because the malware leftovers also pose great risks to the \"stability and behaviour\" of the devices.²⁰⁹ In fact, in the Conflicker Botnet, the leftover malware of the Botnet disabled the security and update mechanisms of five million affected devices.²¹⁰ It is also possible for such leftover malware to join the devices as part of a new Botnet.²¹¹\n200 Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 3 , .\n201 Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 3 , , , ; Coco, and de Souza Dias (n 20) 'Cyber Due Diligence': A Patchwork of Protective Obligations in International Law 787-88.\n202 Ahmad (n 71) Why Botnets Persist: Designing Effective Technical and Policy Interventions, 14.\n203 Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 113\n204 Zeitlin (n 72) Botnet Takedowns and the Fourth Amendment 751-56.\n205 ibid.\n206 Mathew J.

One is to takeover the Botnet's command server to send a notification to users with instructions to uninstall the malware, as the Dutch police demonstrated against the Bredolab Botnet.²¹² Yet this method has several drawbacks. For example, there are often peculiar communication chains in Botnets under which the devices may not promptly receive notifications from the taken-over command server.²¹³ Further, some empirical work shows that users may question the legitimacy of these notifications, given the prevalence of false malware alert scams.²¹⁴ Since control over the command server could be fleeting, giving rise to urgencies, additional measures such as letter or telephonic warnings,²¹⁵ and maintaining a helpdesk such as the German Anti-Botnet initiative²¹⁶ may resolve this concern. However, these measures also require immense technical and financial wherewithal and thus cannot be universal expectations, even if effective.\nA second method to clean-up malware is for law enforcement to unilaterally command the Bots to delete the malware on the infected computers,²¹⁷ akin to the United States approach against the Coreflood Botnet²¹⁸ and Microsoft's against the Citadel Botnets in 2013.²¹⁹ The third method involves unilaterally patching the flaw in the security system of the devices that facilitated the installation of malware to begin with.²²⁰ Apart from being measures that only highly technologically advanced States could be expected to pursue, both these methods carry strong privacy concerns owing to their disregard for user consent.²²¹ This may also allow law enforcement to gain unconsented access to personal data,²²² highlighting the need for human-rights centric legal frameworks regulating Botnet-response measures.²²³ These unilateral measures could also cause unforeseen side effects and should therefore be contemplated cautiously.²²⁴ A State of origin proposing such measures would be bound to conduct prior impact assessments as detailed in Impact assessment obligations around Botnets; as also to co-operate with the potentially affected States. If it undertakes unilateral Botnet takedown or malware clean-up measures that result in significant harm to devices in other States, without having taken appropriate steps to mitigate such harm, it would be in violation of its due diligence obligations.²²⁵\nAs to the remaining common measures, the fixing of software or hardware vulnerabilities that enabled the Botnet's propagation is crucial to improve cybersecurity resilience, such that a similar Botnet does not emerge in the future.²²⁶ The arrest and prosecution of Botmasters would ensure that the same cybercriminals do not rebuild the Botnet once taken down, while\n²¹² BBC (n 73).\n²¹³ Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 110; Ahmad (n 71) Why Botnets Persist: Designing Effective Technical and Policy Interventions 12–13.\n²¹⁴ Wei Meng et and others, 'DNS Changer Remediation Study' (Presentation at the Messaging, Malware, and Mobile Anti-Abuse Working Group 27th General Meeting 7, 19 February 2013) <https: GeorgiaTech_DNSChanger_study-2013-02-19.pdf=\"\" files=\"\" news=\"\" www.m3aawg.org=\"\"> accessed 1 July 2022.\n²¹⁵ Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 111. ibid, page 93.\n²¹⁷ Zeitlin (n 72) 753–54.\n²¹⁸ Brian Krebs, 'FBI Scrubbed 19,000 PCs Snared by Coreflood Botnet' (Krebs On Security, 21 June 2011) <https: attacks-breaches=\"\" microsoft-fails-to-nuke-zeroaccess-botnet=\"\" www.darkreading.com=\"\"> accessed 1 July 2022.\n²¹⁹ In 2013 after sinkholing Citadel botnets used its command infrastructure to update the malware on infected computers.

Yet one commonality across all is the need for international co-operation in their success—cyber capabilities can only flourish best with collective efforts;²²⁹ arrests and prosecutions of transnational cybercriminals can only concretize with mutual legal assistance; and the social evils enabling Botnets eradicated with concerted diplomatic initiatives.²³⁰ It seems then, that due diligence is not only a gap-filling legal arsenal against Botnets amidst the presently mutually suspicious²³¹ State relations in cyberspace; instead, due diligence must also be viewed as a norm that can realize its maximal potential only in a milieu where States develop robust co-operative and consultative efforts. In that vein, it may well become a vehicle for facilitating internationalism in cyberspace, in line with its core logic. This brings us to the final Section of this article, where we detail the overarching obligation of all States toward cyber capacity building, as also the role of international co-operation in its fruition.",
    "# THE OBLIGATION TOWARD CYBER CAPACITY BUILDING": "As previously discussed in Factors affecting standard of conduct and The state of origin's knowledge, the obligation of due diligence is a 'duty of conduct'; yet that carries within it an obligation which is a 'duty of result.'²³² This obligation is to build a 'minimum' institutional capacity that would allow States to effectively carry out their due diligence obligations.²³³ This framework should equip the State to be able to detect potential significant harm and to take appropriate mitigating measures to minimize and prevent the harm. This aspect of due diligence has been recognized by the ILC²³⁴ and ICJ.²³⁵ For capacity building, States should make reasonable efforts to create an ability to detect risk, and the capability to mitigate and halt that risk. This obligation of result is necessary for the due diligence norms to have any bite. States including South Korea, Canada, the United Kingdom and Australia in their report on incorporating UNGGE non-binding norms have focused on the building of institutional capacity.²³⁶ These have included raising awareness, creating an appropriate legislative framework, creating or strengthening departments for countering cyber threats, developing incident response plans and domestic policy, and enabling cooperative partnerships—both domestic and international.²³⁷ As with other due diligence obligations, the minimum baseline that is expected of States would differ based\n²²⁷ ibid 121.\n²²⁸ Ahmad (n 71) Why Botnets Persist: Designing Effective Technical and Policy Interventions, 29–31.\n²²⁹ Supra Section on Impact Assessment Obligations Around Botnets\n²³⁰ Fausto Pocar, 'New Challenges for International Rules Against Cyber-Crime' (2004) 10 European Journal on Criminal Policy and Research 27.\n²³¹ Ney and Zimmermann (n 18) Cyber-Security beyond the Military Perspective: International Law, Cyberspace, and the Concept of Due Diligence.\n²³² Coco, and de Souza Dias (n 20) 'Cyber Due Diligence': A Patchwork of Protective Obligations in International Law, 788; Russel Buchan, 'Cyberspace, Non-State Actors and the Obligation to Prevent Transboundary Harm' (2019) 21 Journal of Conflict &amp; Security Law (2016) 429, 434–439.\n²³³ ibid; ILC, Draft Articles on Prevention Article 3 –; Couzigou (n 62) Securing cyber space: the obligation of States to prevent harmful international cyber operations 50–51.\n²³⁴ Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 3 –, Article 5.\n²³⁵ Pulp Mills .\n²³⁶ Andraz Kastelic, \"Due Diligence in Cyberspace: Normative Expectations of Reciprocal Protection of International Legal Rights\" (UNIDIR, 2021) <https: due-diligence-cyberspace-normative-expectations-reciprocal-protection-international=\"\" publication=\"\" www.unidir.org=\"\"> accessed 1 June 2022, 10.\n²³⁷ ibid.</https:>\nREVISITING DUE DILIGENCE IN CYBERSPACE\n343\non their resources and socio-economic factors.²³⁸ Consequently, this baseline would differ for developed states, developing states and LDCs.\nThis Section attempts to provide indicators which States can follow for the process of establishing the capability to detect contemporary Botnets and conduct mitigation efforts. Such indicators would also serve to illustrate the conduct expected from States as technologies and Botnet threats evolve.²³⁹ Further, States are free to design their institutional baseline as long as it is adequate for the harm in question.²⁴⁰ While being mindful of capacity differentials of States, we divide these baseline measures into six categories: national/sectoral cybersecurity strategies, legal measures, measures focusing on preventing Botnet infection, on early detection of botnets, collaborative measures, and review-related measures.\n## National/Sectoral cybersecurity strategies\nStates have limited resources and regulatory capacities. Due diligence recognizes this central pillar of policymaking²⁴¹ and accordingly, it requires states to use their best efforts based on their capabilities.²⁴² To allocate their resources and the regulatory capacity in an economically efficient manner, States should create a strategy for countering threats akin to Botnets based on a risk-based approach, which would help the State identify threats and security gaps that pose a high risk and those that pose a low risk.²⁴³ Based on this level of risk assessment, the State can focus its resources on priority areas where high-risk vulnerabilities exist. This process can be and should ideally be performed both nationally and sectorally.²⁴⁴\nNational cybersecurity strategies should become the cornerstone that guides State measures and initiatives.²⁴⁵ Special focus should be on strengthening and making their networks more resilient to support critical infrastructure, critical supply chains and major financial institutions.²⁴⁶ Such a National Cybersecurity strategy can also be developed based on a multi-stakeholder approach as recommended by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU).²⁴⁷ As regards feasibility, the most States should be able to draw up these strategies as it only requires states to take stock of their resources, their regulatory capacity and the landscape of threats faced by them. Indeed, as of 2020, the ITU found that 127 countries out of 194 countries have now adopted a National Cyber Strategy.²⁴⁸\n## Legal measures\nA suitable legal and regulatory framework is the bedrock of due diligence. As the ILC in their Draft Articles on Transboundary Harm notes, “[s]tates concerned shall take the necessary legislative, administrative or other action…”²⁴⁹. The legal framework should lay out relevant rights\n²³⁸ Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 3 – 17; Coco, and de Souza Dias (n 20) Cyber Due Diligence: A Patchwork of Protective Obligations in International Law 787-88; Buchan (n 20) Cyberspace, Non-State Actors and the Obligation to Prevent Transboundary Harm 443; Bannelier-Christakis (n 20) Cyber Diligence: A Low-Intensity Due Diligence Principle for Low-Intensity Cyber Operations? 37; Couzigou (n 62) Securing cyber space: the obligation of States to prevent harmful international cyber operations 47.\n²³⁹ Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 3 .\n²⁴⁰ Coco, and de Souza Dias (n 20) Cyber Due Diligence: A Patchwork of Protective Obligations in International Law, 787-88.\n²⁴¹ OECD, OECD Regulatory Policy Outlook 2021: Risk-based regulation (OECD Publishing, 2021).\n²⁴² Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 3 , .\n²⁴³ ITU, 'ITU Botnet Mitigation Toolkit' (Jan 2008) ITU Telecommunication Development Sector <https: cyp=\"\" itub-cyb=\"\" cyp/ecybersecurity=\"\" docs=\"\" itu-botnet-mitigation-toolkit-background.pdf=\"\" www.itu.int=\"\"> accessed 1 July 2022, 25; Shackelford, Russell and Kuehn (n 84) Unpacking the International Law on Cybersecurity Due Diligence: Lessons from the Public and Private Sectors 34-42.\n²⁴⁴ Coco, and de Souza Dias (n 30) Cyber due diligence in international law 187-190.\n²⁴⁵ ITU (n 176) Global Cybersecurity Index 2020 145-47; ITU (n 243) Botnet Mitigation Toolkit 25.\n²⁴⁶ ibid.\n²⁴⁷ ibid.\n²⁴⁸ ibid.\n²⁴⁹ Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 5.</https:>\nABHIJEET SHRIVASTAVA AND RUDRAKSH LAKRA\nand responsibilities clearly for State and private parties, and the sanctions and remedies in case of a breach.²⁵⁰ Such a framework would provide foresight to those subject to it and promote deterrence.²⁵¹ In connection to Botnets, any legal framework should attempt to meet two objectives: first, it should clearly criminalize the operation of a Botnet and second, it should provide tools to law enforcement, and other State bodies to effectively investigate and take enforcement actions against Botnets.²⁵² Attempts at facilitating such legal frameworks can take guidance from prevailing international and regional standards.²⁵³\nTurning first to criminalization, the criminalizing law should capture the range of crimes committed by Botnets; these include both ‘core’ cybercrime and ‘cyber-enabled’ crimes. States should ensure that the definition of the crimes adopted by the law should not be such that it succumbs to obsolescence very soon with technological changes.²⁵⁴ A possible approach for this is to define cyber-criminal activities at a high level of abstraction, which would also cover crimes unforeseeable at the time.²⁵⁵ This is in line with the approach in the Budapest Convention.²⁵⁶ Further in line with the Budapest Convention and other such initiatives, it is important to push for creating a uniform and common legislative baseline framework across jurisdictions, so that Botmasters could not exploit any difference in laws in different countries.²⁵⁷ In this regard, there is presently wide disagreement between States about the precise content of crimes beyond core crimes, as presently seen in ongoing debates under the UN’s auspices around a cybercrime treaty.²⁵⁸ This disagreement limits the possibility of harmonization, and thus, one hopes that a representative consensus is reached.\nRegarding the second proposed objective for laws, as Lubin explains, using existing domestic legal remedies such as injunction orders can be inappropriate for Botnet mitigation.²⁵⁹ Thus, the law should provide remedies and procedural tools which accommodate the uniqueness of cyberspace and facilitate suitable resources tailored for Botnet mitigation. The question of which procedural tools law enforcement should have can again be resolved by drawing from international standards.²⁶⁰ There is also a need to build regulatory capacity in a manner that Botnet mitigation operations could be approved at a quicker pace and the body adjudicating these requests is well versed in the specific practical and technical details.²⁶¹ Having a quicker turnaround period is important as Botnets are constantly evolving.²⁶² Consequently, responses against them can quickly become antiquated.\n²⁵⁰ Coco, and de Souza Dias (n 30) Cyber due diligence in international law 171.\n²⁵¹ ibid.\n²⁵² Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 121–22, 125, 127; ITU (n 243) Botnet Mitigation Toolkit 21–31.\n²⁵³ For instance see, Convention on Cybercrime (adopted 23 Nov 2001, entered into force 1 July 2004) 2296 UNTS 167; Arab Convention on Combating Information Technology Offences (adopted 21 December 2010); African Union Convention on Cyber Security and Personal Data Protection (adopted 27 June 2014); UNODC, ‘Second session of the Ad Hoc Committee’ (Second session of the Ad Hoc Committee to Elaborate a Comprehensive International Convention on Countering the Use of Information and Communications Technologies for Criminal Purposes, 2022) <https: ad_hoc_committee=\"\" chc-second-session.html=\"\" en=\"\" www.unodc.org=\"\"> accessed 1 July 2022; ITU (n 243) Botnet Mitigation Toolkit.\n²⁵⁴ Gerard (n 6) Botnet Mitigation and International Law 226.\n²⁵⁵ ibid.\n²⁵⁶ ibid.\n²⁵⁷ Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 25.\n²⁵⁸ Tomaso Falchetta, Deborah Brown and Katitza Rodriguez, ‘Opening Stages in UN Cybercrime Treaty Talks Reflect Human Rights Risks’ (Just Security, 18 April 2022) <https: 81105=\"\" apri=\"\" opening-stages-in-un-cybercrime-treaty-talks-reflect-human-rights-risks=\"\" www.justsecurity.org=\"\"></https:> accessed 30 June 2022.\n²⁵⁹ Lubin, and Marinotti (n 175) Why Current Botnet Takedown Jurisprudence Should Not Be Replicated.\n²⁶⁰ For instance see, Convention on Cybercrime (adopted 23 Nov 2001, entered into force 1 July 2004) 2296 UNTS 167; Arab Convention on Combating Information Technology Offences (adopted 21 Dec 2010); African Union Convention on Cyber Security and Personal Data Protection (adopted 27 June 2014); UNODC, ‘Second session of the Ad Hoc Committee’ (Second session of the Ad Hoc Committee to Elaborate a Comprehensive International Convention on Countering the Use of Information and Communications Technologies for Criminal Purposes, 2022) <https: ad_hoc_committee=\"\" chc-second-session.html=\"\" en=\"\" www.unodc.org=\"\"> accessed 1 July 2022; ITU (n 243) Botnet Mitigation Toolkit.\n²⁶¹ Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 116, 126.\n²⁶² ibid.</https:></https:>\nREVISITING DUE DILIGENCE IN CYBERSPACE\n345\nIt is important to acknowledge that any such legal and regulatory framework should draw a practical balance between enforcement interests and human rights, especially the right to privacy.²⁶³ This is because the principle of due diligence needs to be exercised in compliance with a State's other international legal obligations.²⁶⁴ To elaborate, whenever the right of privacy is implicated, the measure should meet the requirement of legality (accessibility, foresight, independent oversight and data protection safeguards), necessity and proportionality.²⁶⁵ This is linked to our earlier discussion in Mitigating or preventing Botnet-related harms as to how privacy should be taken into account when conducting mitigation measures.\nA final observation is required for the question of the State's capacity to undertake legal and regulatory measures. Some authors have argued that all states are presumably capable of creating such a framework. However, as we highlighted in Factors affecting standard of conduct and Differential capacities for assessment techniques, even creating cybercrime legislation tailored to the threat of Botnet would require financial and technical investments.²⁶⁶ To reiterate, as of 2020, 27 countries out of 194 surveyed by ITU did not have any cybercrime-specific legislations.²⁶⁷ Moreover, even if States had cyber-specific legislations, having an adequate regulatory capacity to enforce it could be particularly challenging for LDCs and certain developing states, as discussed earlier.²⁶⁸\n## Measures for preventing Botnet infections\nPreventive efforts against Botnets can be much more effective than combating Botnet-related threats once the Botnet mushrooms into harmful scales.²⁶⁹ If proactive measures are undertaken to this end, the creation of Botnets, and potentially their potency can be limited if and when States deploy Botnet mitigation measures as described in Mitigating or preventing Botnet-related harms.²⁷⁰ One way to limit the operation and spread of Botnets is to minimize and prevent the infection of devices.²⁷¹ There are primarily two methods through which contemporary Botnets can infect devices—first, by exploiting the vulnerabilities in the software, hardware or firmware used by the devices or second, by social engineering.²⁷²\nThe first method of propagation of malware can be limited first by regulating the suppliers of ICT products in requiring them to follow baseline security measures based on best practices.²⁷³ For this, States such as China, Japan, the United Kingdom, Germany, South Africa and Brazil have focused on technical standards, verification, certification or accreditation schemes.²⁷⁴ Moreover, similar to the harmonization of criminal provisions, there is a need for inter-State dialogue on global baseline security practice.²⁷⁵ This is because Botnets frequently infect devices across a tremendous number of States—for instance, the Mirai botnet infected Botnets in around 85 countries.²⁷⁶ States, particularly LDCs and developing States that do not have the\n²⁶³ ibid. 111.\n²⁶⁴ Coco, and de Souza Dias (n 30) Cyber due diligence in international law 137.\n²⁶⁵ Privacy International, 'Guide to International Law and Surveillance' (Privacy International, Dec 2021) <https: 2021%20gils%20version%203.0_0.pdf=\"\" default=\"\" files=\"\" sites=\"\" www.privacyinternational.org=\"\"> accessed 1 July 2022.\n²⁶⁶ Supra Sub-section on Factors Affecting Standard Of Conduct and Sub-section on Differential Capacities For Assessment Techniques.\n²⁶⁷ ITU (n 176) Global Cybersecurity Index 2020 vii.\n²⁶⁸ Supra Sub-section on Differential Capacities For Assessment Techniques.\n²⁶⁹ Ahmad (n 71) Why Botnets Persist: Designing Effective Technical and Policy Interventions, 26–27; Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 123.\n²⁷⁰ ibid.\n²⁷¹ ibid.\n²⁷² Ahmad (n 71) Why Botnets Persist: Designing Effective Technical and Policy Interventions, 26–27.\n²⁷³ ibid.; Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 123; ITU (n 243) Botnet Mitigation Toolkit.\n²⁷⁴ Coco, and de Souza Dias (n 30) Cyber due diligence in international law 181–186.\n²⁷⁵ ibid.\n²⁷⁶ Ahmad (n 71) Why Botnets Persist: Designing Effective Technical and Policy Interventions, 26–27.</https:>\nABHIJEET SHRIVASTAVA AND RUDRAKSH LAKRA\ncapacity to build their own security standards, can benefit from the best practices publicized by international and regional organizations.²⁷⁷ Further, the vulnerabilities in ICT products can be tackled by carrying out cybersecurity awareness campaigns that focus on end-user awareness to ensure that users keep their software and firmware up to date and install patches.²⁷⁸ Widespread adoption of baseline security practice could make it exacting for Botmasters to infect secured devices and it would limit the proportion of unsecured devices. Infecting secured devices would require more investment, and if it is more than the expected financial return, the financial incentive for Botmasters to create Botnets at all could be curtailed.²⁷⁹\nTurning to the second manner in which Botnets generally propagate—social engineering—it is a method that involves manipulating the end users into committing errors for evading their device security. This is a psychological manipulation technique aiming to manoeuvre users into making security lapses, so as to gain unauthorised access to users' private information, devices, or valuables. However, this method too can be challenged by carrying out cybersecurity awareness campaigns that focus on building tech-literacy, particularly regarding the malware-spreading mechanisms and methods of social engineering.²⁸⁰ These campaigns should focus more on private companies as end-users, given that they have greater financial resources generally than individual end-users, and particularly small and medium enterprises which are more vulnerable.²⁸¹\nA capacity-building measure that would be common as a defense for both methods of Botnet propagation is conducting extensive cybersecurity awareness programs.²⁸² These programs require financial bandwidth to fund campaigns, and technical expertise since trained professionals are needed to spearhead them.²⁸³ Comprehensive public cybersecurity campaigns are arduous for developing and LDC countries. For instance, the ITU Cybersecurity Index revealed that more than half of the countries under examination did not have any cybersecurity educational programs or training for professionals.²⁸⁴ Similarly, a study of cybersecurity awareness for users and executives in Africa found that in the surveyed countries, the lack of such awareness was a major institutional deficiency, necessitating robust programs of this nature.²⁸⁵\n## Measures for early detection\nThe obligation of cyber capacity building toward creating a minimum institutional framework also aims at enabling States to detect threats that pose a risk of significant harm. In the case of Botnets, there is a need to create initiatives that focus on their 'early' detection.²⁸⁶ These can be worked upon by virtue of various mechanisms and initiatives, including some of the presently feasible ones we discuss hereafter.

The CIRTs should engage in information sharing with relevant stakeholders and actors who may have access to information about infections.²⁸⁸ This could include ISP, DNS, anti-virus companies, researchers and private companies facing the primary brunt of cybercrimes.²⁸⁹ However, we reiterate our caution from Differential capacities for assessment techniques in terms of how establishing a CIRT can require significant resources and LDCs particularly face many roadblocks and establishing such frameworks.²⁹⁰ The third mechanism for early detection is based on the cooperation between the State and DNS operators; this is limited to Botnets with command servers that use DNS-based communication protocol.²⁹¹ Here, the focus should be on mitigation efforts. For this, States could create a Botnet-related DNS abuse reputation system that identifies automatically and accurately the malicious domain before they appear on the blacklist.²⁹² However, all of the techniques discussed above would require the cooperation of private entities such as DNS operators and could be demanding for LDCs, especially if some developing States had to compel these private entities if they are non-cooperative, as elaborated in Section on Impact Assessment Obligations Around Botnets.²⁹³ Thus, these techniques may be accepted as good practices, rather than as an obligation for States to meet, especially as they, in any case, serve as illustrations of efforts that could not be alleged as below the due diligence standard.\n## Collaborative measures\nThroughout the article, we have seen how tackling the threat of Botnets requires cooperation and improved communication between relevant stakeholders since they may hold a distinct piece of the puzzle.²⁹⁴ As we have previously noted, Botnets are by their very nature transnational in scope, and due to their scale can often only be taken down by the cooperation not only between multiple States but also private parties which are involved in the takedown, such as antivirus companies, researchers, ISP and DNS providers and other tech companies.²⁹⁵ Impact assessment obligations around Botnets and Mitigating or preventing Botnet-related harms explain how conducting an impact assessment and taking mitigation or prevention measures necessitates a multi-stakeholder approach.²⁹⁶ A concomitant aim should be to build long-term and sustainable collaborations.²⁹⁷ Currently, private actors are not always given their due importance and inter-State cooperation on criminal matters is burdensome and slow as shown by contemporary mutual legal assistance processes.²⁹⁸ Consequently, there is a strong need to create\n²⁸⁷ Ahmad (n 71) Why Botnets Persist: Designing Effective Technical and Policy Interventions 27–29; Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 122.\n²⁸⁸ Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 121.\n²⁸⁹ ibid. 121, 95–102; Ahmad (n 71) Why Botnets Persist: Designing Effective Technical and Policy Interventions, 32–33.\n²⁹⁰ Supra Sub-section on Differential Capacities For Assessment Techniques.\n²⁹¹ Ahmad (n 71) Why Botnets Persist: Designing Effective Technical and Policy Interventions, 27–29.\n²⁹² ibid.; Shuang Hao, Nick Feamster, and Ramakant Pandrangi, 'Monitoring the initial DNS behavior of malicious domains' (IMC '11: Proceedings of the 2011 ACM SIGCOMM conference on Internet measurement conference, November 2011) <https: 2011=\"\" conf2011=\"\" docs=\"\" docx=\"\" p269.pdf=\"\" www.nytimes.com=\"\"> accessed 1 July 2022.\n²⁹³ Supra Sub-section on Differential Capacities For Assessment Techniques.\n²⁹⁴ Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 121–23, 126–28.\n²⁹⁵ For instance, see, David E.

Third, the review should audit the adequacy of its overall cybersecurity infrastructure and efforts.³⁰³ Lastly, as the ITU recommends, the State can require entities both public and private to carry out an periodic cybersecurity audit that examines the information system’s security.³⁰⁴ This can focus on the physical configuration of the systems and software, information handling processes, user practices and environment.³⁰⁵ Again, all these suggestions must be treated as illustrations of good practices crucial for the maximal fruition of States’ due diligence obligations. We do not propose that these exact measures ought to necessarily be pursued as a matter of duty, especially given capacity differentials—however, these presently serve as some of the best possible examples of conduct the diligence of which could not reasonably be doubted. We are, therefore, hopeful for wider adoption of practices of this rigour.",
    "## CONCLUSION": "Through this article, we have reaffirmed the increasing confidence in scholarly views for due diligence as a crucial means of regulating transboundary cyber operations. This faith was concretized through a unique legal and policy study of contemporary Botnets, which are among the gravest threats posed in cyberspace. That said, we demonstrated several cautions toward treating due diligence as a panacea against the Pandora’s box of harms opened by the advent of cyberspace, including for Botnets. This included evidentiary dilemmas that target States may face in proving violations of the norm, particularly given the differential standards of conduct expected of States based on their respective capacities—a nuance that we appreciated in relation to the context of the Botnet concerned, as also the State’s capacity against the specific Botnet concerned.\nYet, we also showed that many of these concerns apply to any international legal norm in the face of the novelties of this terrain. Further, due diligence connotes a spectrum of obligations for which target States may pursue the responsibility of a State of origin. This is from the very first stage of demanding that States conduct an impact assessment in the event of a preliminary\n²⁹⁹ Ahmad (n 71) Why Botnets Persist: Designing Effective Technical and Policy Interventions 27–29.\n³⁰⁰ Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 5.\n³⁰¹ Shackelford, Russell and Kuehn (n 84) ‘Unpacking the International Law on Cybersecurity Due Diligence: Lessons from the Public and Private Sectors 41–42.\n³⁰² Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 3 paras .\n³⁰³ Shackelford, Russell and Kuehn (n 84) ‘Unpacking the International Law on Cybersecurity Due Diligence: Lessons from the Public and Private Sectors 41–42; ITU (n 176) Global Cybersecurity Index 2020 146.\n³⁰⁴ ITU (n 176) Global Cybersecurity Index 2020 141.\n³⁰⁵ ibid.\nREVISITING DUE DILIGENCE IN CYBERSPACE\n349\nrisk of harm from Botnets being administered in their jurisdiction (or from the State of origin's response-measures against the Botnets); to the obligation to notify, consult and co-operate with the States potentially affected by the Botnet incident; to the State of origin's obligation to prevent and mitigate transboundary Botnet harm with its best efforts as per its cyber capacity. To that end, we also unpacked the continuous obligation of all States toward cyber capacity building, to facilitate the discharge of their aforesaid obligations against Botnet-related harms. All in all, we submitted that the promise and benefits of due diligence are such as to empower meaningful cyber resilience against Botnets. This is not just until more specific treaties on the subject hopefully take shape—instead, there is merit in supporting the codification and concretization of the norm even in any such future instruments. Indeed, the capacity differentials in due diligence may hold great promise for developing States and LDCs, given its equitable logics.\nIn presenting our claims, we have been conscious of the definitional uncertainties that the articulation of due diligence has carried with respect to the 'Corfu Channel' and 'prevention of harm' principles, including in discourse around cyberspace. Yet we argued for a novel coherent conception of due diligence that unifies these principles, providing States and cybersecurity experts much-needed clarity in understanding the scope of its obligations and trigger-thresholds for complex threats such as Botnets. We also outlined various questions with respect to each specific sub-obligation under due diligence that necessitates urgent dialogue between States. In outlining the standards of conduct expected under due diligence, we exposited scientific literature concerning contemporary Botnets, as also several instances of good practices in this context. We are conscious that those illustrations may become anachronistic as technology advances. The point, however, was largely to demonstrate—unlike thus far seen in cyberspace literature—a concrete methodology and guidelines for States to appreciate the precise rigour of diligence that would be required of them against threats like Botnets. To that extent, it is safe to presume that the relevance of these contentions will remain foregrounded for a long time.\nWhile due diligence is indeed a strong legal device to facilitate international co-operation against Botnets, the opposite is equally true. Considering not least the sheer scale of contemporary transboundary Botnets, the fullest and meaningful actualization of due diligence in cyberspace is only possible with greater international co-operation between States and private actors alike, especially for cyber capacity building. Therefore, there remains an urgent need for robust co-operative and consultative efforts against Botnets and similar threats—which in the end, would only be to the collective benefit of the entire international community at large.",

In existing scholarship, many reasons have informed growing support for the promise of 'due diligence' obligations in regulating transboundary cyber operations. We affirm this position through a study of the specific context of Botnets, although bringing much-needed caution and complexity to the discourse. We offer a comprehensive account of the standard of conduct expected of States in detecting, mitigating and preventing Botnet-linked harms under due diligence; as well as to pursue cyber capacity building toward discharging these obligations. In so doing, we problematize and elaborate on the nature of due diligence as an obligation of conduct, therefore accounting for differential State capacities against Botnet-linked harms. The paper involves attempts to unpack a coherent conception of due diligence, appreciating the spectrum of obligations that it demands, and demonstrating these nuances through an appraisal of good practices adopted by States and private actors against Botnets. Consequently, we provide a unique holistic account of how States and their law enforcement could practically understand the conduct expected of them when faced with transboundary Botnets on a case-to-case basis. In the end, while underscoring potential dilemmas within this legal regime that may be faced by target States, as also its unresolved questions, we submit that due diligence is indeed the most appropriate candidate to act as a legal arsenal against transboundary Botnets.\nKEYWORDS: cyberspace, international law, due diligence, cybersecurity, Botnets.\n# INTRODUCTION\nThe past decades have witnessed unforeseen and unprecedented technological advancements. The advent of information communication technology (ICT) has birthed a new domain in\n© The Author(s) (2022). Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

Formally defined as an “environment” comprising the “physical and non-physical components” of ICT that transmit data, cyberspace is in practice the closest arena one could informally describe as “borderless”. Yet this terrain brought with it a host of cybersecurity threats, including cybercrime.\nWithin the ecosystem of cybercrime, ‘Botnets’ are the apex species. Botnets refer to a set of compromised devices (Bots) that are controlled by a ‘Botmaster’ usually without the knowledge of device users, typically to carry out a variety of cybercrimes. There is “no practical limit” on the number of devices that Botnets may ‘infect’. For example, the Zeus Botnet has now infected over 13 million devices in 196 countries, causing financial losses of over 120 million USD. Given the decrease in entry barrier costs in the tool kits required to create Botnets, they are now frequently used for cyber-attacks, distributed denial of service attacks (DDOS), ransomware, click fraud, identity theft, and the spread of hate speech, among other threats. Considering their cross-border impact, Botmasters exploit divergences across the domestic legal systems of States to escape accountability. Owing to the vacuum of a globally unified effort against cybercrime, cyber-criminals such as Botmasters seem to enjoy a “safe haven”.\nPresently, there is no major treaty addressing cybercrime, apart from the Convention on Cybercrime (Budapest Convention) which has 66 signatories. Yet even the Budapest Convention has been criticized by many for its narrow set of obligations and its failures to keep up with evolving technology since 2001. As we write, negotiations for drafts of a new treaty on cybercrime are underway under the auspices of the United Nations. However, the scope of this proposed treaty thus far also remains in doubt, and in any case, the extent of its future acceptance would face several obstacles that we discuss hereafter. In summary, there is no effective special law-governing inter-State conduct against cybercrime. Confusion, therefore, prevails as to the legal obligations of States around Botnets and transboundary cyber operations broadly\n Vasileios Karagiannopoulos, *Living With Hacktivism From Conflict to Symbiosis* (Palgrave Macmillan, 2018) 1–13.\n Michael N.

This is a “best efforts” obligation, which would require States to prevent or minimize harm to other States from Botnets that are being administered under their jurisdiction. It would equally cover the cyber responses of States or private actors in their jurisdiction against such Botnets with transboundary effects. In this article, we affirm this position, albeit while problematizing the unconditional optimism that most authors have shown for due diligence. In The relevance of due diligence for cyberspace, we offer a renewed theoretical formulation of due diligence, which is more precise and clearer than existing scholarship. Simultaneously, we consider why this formulation is appropriate for cyberspace and against Botnets. Since due diligence involves “best effort” obligations, we then dive deep into how the standard of conduct expected from each State would vary based on State cyber capacity differentials and the context of the cyber threat. This analysis in Unpacking differential standards of conduct is accompanied by our reflections on the evidentiary dilemmas that States affected by transboundary harm would face in proving breaches of due diligence.\nThereafter, we categorically elaborate the specific obligations demanded by due diligence in relation to Botnets. Triggers for due diligence obligations discuss the trigger points for the majority of due diligence obligations to become applicable. We then discuss obligations concerning the mitigation and prevention of harm that Botnets may cause to other States as well as the role of international cooperation in this regard. In Impact assessment obligations around Botnets, we analyze the obligation to conduct “impact assessments” in case of a preliminary risk of transboundary harm; and in Mitigating or preventing Botnet-related harms, we proceed to mitigation and prevention obligations, while tracing several instances of State and private-led efforts against various Botnets. Finally, we elaborate the obligation of States toward cyber capacity building against Botnet-like threats in The obligation toward cyber capacity building, with extensive discussion of good practices in that context.

Instead, in Reconceiving due diligence, we focus on providing an original and clear theoretical conception of the demands of due diligence. Following this, we briefly discuss in The preference for due diligence the reasons for scholarly confidence in due diligence obligations in the context of cyberspace.\n# Reconceiving due diligence\nTo what end are due diligence obligations designed? Some scholars have differentiated between two allegedly distinct conceptions of due diligence: first, the 'Corfu Channel principle' as emergent from the earliest judgment of the International Court of Justice (ICJ); and second, the 'prevention of harm principle'. Turning to the first, the ICJ in Corfu Channel held that Albania violated international law by failing to notify British Ships that Albanian territorial waters contained a minefield. This was even though Albania itself was not found responsible for laying the said mines. The ICJ also held this to be in breach of the obligation \"not to knowingly allow its territory\" to be \"used for acts contrary to the rights of other States\" [emphasis ours]. Certain authors consider this to mean that due diligence is a 'standard of conduct' which attaches to \"primary\" norms, including in respecting the \"rights\" of other States. For example, in Bosnian genocide, the ICJ held that Serbia and Montenegro violated its duty to prevent genocide in Srebrenica, by failing to exercise \"due diligence\" in using all \"all means reasonably at its disposal\". In this conception, due diligence does not create self-contained obligations, but only serves as a general rubric to measure compliance with other obligations.\nIn parallel, the 'prevention of harm' conception, inter alia, requires States to exercise due diligence so as to prevent or minimize \"significant\" transboundary harm to other States—when such harm originates in their territory. This conception also reflects customary international law, as per the ICJ's judgments in Pulp Mills and Nicaragua v. Costa Rica, which concerned alleged harms to rivers. In this formulation, due diligence does contain self-contained obligations whenever there is a risk of \"significant\" harm. Here, 'significance'\n See generally Heike Krieger, Anne Peters, and Leonhard Kreuzer (eds), Due Diligence in the International Legal Order (OUP, 2020).\n Coco, and de Souza Dias (n 20) Cyber Due Diligence: A Patchwork of Protective Obligations in International Law.\n Corfu Channel (United Kingdom v.

Under the other, even otherwise unprohibited activities become unlawful when resulting in “significant harm”. What then, is the law as it stands? In their positions on how international law applies to cyberspace, many States have highlighted the Corfu Channel conception, while others have supported the prevention of harm conception. Some have instead advanced a singular conception where both the violation of a third State’s rights and “significant harm” need to be conjunctively proven. This is also the approach of the Tallinn Manual 2.0, thus far the most authoritative scholarly text on the law applicable to cyberspace.\nWe regret such inconsistent or incomplete formulations of due diligence by States and scholars alike. We argue that both the Corfu Channel principle and the prevention of harm principle must be construed as part and parcel of a singular due diligence norm. In our conception, due diligence requires the prevention of “significant” transboundary harm. First, when such harm is in violation of any international legal obligation, such as the duty to prevent genocide, the harm must be presumed as significant. However, as we elaborate in *Significant harms from Botnets*, only in the rare event that such an illegal act poses only inconsequential harm, due diligence obligations arguably may not be imposed on States of origin if that would cause an undue burden. Second, in the absence of inherent unlawfulness in the transboundary harm, the significance of the harm can then be examined on a case-to-case basis, using factors that we shall elaborate in Triggers for due diligence obligations. This revised conception has many benefits. One, it coheres two strands of due diligence that have both been recognized by the ICJ. Two, it gives maximal clarity to States seeking to act diligently, as also to States seeking to allege violations of due diligence. Clarity is crucial for any norm to be operational in cyberspace, which is a terrain carrying its own uncertainties. We therefore adopt this two-fold conception of due diligence in the following Sections.\n Certain Activities Carried out by Nicaragua in the Border Area (Costa Rica v Nicaragua) and Construction of a Road in Costa Rica along the San Juan River (Nicaragua v Costa Rica) (Merits) [2015] ICJ Rep 200 [155].\n Coco and de Souza Dias (n 20) ‘Cyber Due Diligence’: A Patchwork of Protective Obligations in International Law, 790.\n ibid.\n Office for Disarmament Affairs, ‘Comments by Member States on the Initial Pre-Draft of the OEWG Report’ (Open-ended Working Group, 2021) <www.un.org disarmament=\"\" open-ended-working-group=\"\"></www.un.org> accessed 1 July 2022 (see individual comments from the Czech Republic and Republic of Korea).\n ‘President of the Republic of Estonia at the opening of CyCon 2019’ (CyCon, 29 May 2019) <https: cjefiles.s3.amazonaws.com=\"\" cgpt=\"\" pdf=\"\" cybernorms=\"\" lawstatements=\"\" remarks+by+the+president+of+the+republic+of+estonia+at+the+opening+of+cycon+2019.pdf=\"\" cech=\"\" cech_rapublic=\"\"> accessed 30 June 2022; Janne Taalas, Ambassador Finland, ‘Statement at the second session of the open-ended Working Group (OEWG) on developments in the field of information and telecommunications in the context of international security’ (Open-ended Working Group, February 2020) <https: 10=\"\" 2018=\"\" ccdcoe.org=\"\" cdc0e=\"\" ccdcoe.org.=\"\" online=\"\" opend=\"\" opend,=\"\" ut=\"\" ut.=\"\" ut.2nd-session-of-oewg.pdf=\"\" uploads=\"\" www.cdci.org=\"\"> accessed 1st July 2022; Organization of American States, ‘Improving Transparency — International Law and State Cyber Operations: Fourth Report (Presented by Prof. Duncan B.

We also take for granted in this article the assertion that all existing international law norms apply to cyberspace, in the absence of new opinio juris to the contrary. Indeed, this is now the majority view in both scholarship and the recent positions of States. The question then naturally arises as to why for addressing harmful cyber operations, including Botnets, in particular, we choose to focus on due diligence when the entire spectrum of international law remains open.\nSeveral reasons justify this choice. First, consider the frequent situations where the Botnet or cyber operation is conducted by private actors. To prove the responsibility of the State where the transboundary harm originates (State of origin), the State affected by such harm (target State) would have to prove that the Botnet's operation is attributable to the State of origin. The attribution of private actions, such as this Botnet, would only arise if the stringent factual test of \"instruction, direction or control\" is met. The test of \"instruction\" has very limited scope, while the joint test of \"direction or control\" requires proof of \"effective control\" over each allegedly wrongful act. The latter test has never been successful before the ICJ, and rarely before other fora. A test that is already onerous is further complicated by the immense difficulties States face in collecting digital evidence of attribution in cyberspace, given, for example, novel masking or spoofing technology. Therefore, proving the violation of other norms, such as the use of force prohibition, is far from feasible—especially for States lacking advanced cyberinfrastructure.\n Coco and de Souza Dias (n 20) 'Cyber Due Diligence': A Patchwork of Protective Obligations in International Law, 790.\n Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons (Advisory Opinion) [1996] ICJ Reps 226 [2]; Pulp Mills [101].\n Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 2 [4], [8].

DILIGENCE IN CYBERSPACE\nWhile some authors raise the continuing debates over the thresholds of other primary norms as another reason to prefer due diligence,58 we do not exaggerate this factor—since as we shall show, concretizing due diligence, including the \"significant\" harm threshold also presents difficulties in cyberspace. Still, due diligence can operate in tandem with those primary norms that contain a preventive or positive effort aspect—such as the positive obligation to prevent genocide,59 protect human rights60 and so forth. In this respect, for failing to take measures against Botnets causing specific kinds of harm, the indirect responsibility of States can be alleged—even when the Botnets are not attributable to the State of origin.61 Furthermore, as we elaborate in Unpacking differential standards of conduct, the conduct expected in due diligence is flexible—responding to the factual context as well as the concerned State's own capacities.62 Therefore, in a terrain such as cyberspace and against the threat of Botnets—both of which are constantly and rapidly evolving, due diligence serves the advantage of accommodating advancements in technology,63 as well as imposing an equitable standard of conduct on the States based on their uneven cyber capabilities.64\nMoreover, as noted in Introduction, there are presently no treaties meaningfully addressing threats such as Botnets. This is, among other reasons, because States have thus far been unwilling to limit their freedoms in ways that may implicate their own policies; as also their hesitations given the unpredictable growths of technology.[65] Yet even if a treaty does arise in the future, we propose that it ought to codify due diligence as aforementioned to operationalize it in cyberspace. Even if it does not, due diligence obligations would co-exist with the treaty obligations, as has been the case previously,[66] unless the treaty provisions conflict with the custom, such that the lex specialis rule is triggered.[67] Finally, as we argue in The obligation toward cyber capacity building, due diligence also imposes a general duty on States toward cyber capacity building, which would enhance cybersecurity worldwide. This capacity building would enable States to detect and mitigate the harms posed by transboundary Botnets, which we elaborate as their obligation in Mitigating or preventing Botnet-related harms. For all these reasons, as international law stands, due diligence is the most appropriate norm for regulating the international response to cyber operations such as Botnets.\n\nABHIJEET SHRIVASTAVA AND RUDRAKSH LAKRA\n# UNPACKING DIFFERENTIAL STANDARDS OF CONDUCT\nThis Section contains one of the most important contributions of this article. It considers an in-depth examination of the implications of due diligence being an obligation of best efforts. First, we discuss a variety of factors to be considered when assessing the standard of conduct expected of States of origin based on their cyber capacity. Simultaneously, we elaborate how the factual context around a concerned cyber threat will affect the State of origin's obligations. Second, we consider if this breath of variable factors may evidently impair a target State's case that a State of origin violated its due diligence obligations. This allows a pragmatic appraisal of the obstacles to establishing State responsibility in inter-State litigation.\n# Factors affecting standard of conduct\nThe obligation to prevent and minimize significant transboundary harm is an obligation of 'conduct' and not of 'result.' As hinted earlier, this means that due diligence requires a State of origin only to utilize the means reasonably available to it to meet this expectation, rather than succeeding at preventing or minimizing harm. Thus, the obligations imposed on States of origin are commensurate with their wherewithal—i.e., their cybersecurity capacities comprising financial, technical and institutional resources.\nConsider the question of technical means. The most prevalent forms of Botnets involve a 'command and control' server which sends instructions to Bots from specific web domains.[71] One method of disabling a Botnet is \"sinkholing\"—here, law enforcement takes control of these web domains, and redirects the Bot traffic to severs under their control.[72] When the Dutch police took over the Bredolab Botnet in 2010, it employed this method and used its server to notify all affected users that their devices had been compromised.[73] Could one then assume that whenever a Botnet emerges, with the Botmaster operating the command server in The Netherlands, the Dutch police can be presumed to have the means to sinkhole the Botnet? The answer is in negative.\nFor example, several Botmasters have employed techniques to generate mass false domain names, owing to which locating the command server becomes arduous.[74] In such cases, concerns arise as to collisions with legitimate domains when law enforcement attempts to target malicious domains.[75] In addition, as seen in the Mariposa Botnet takedown by Spanish authorities, not all Botnets use \"static malware\", meaning that Botmasters can often update the code of the malware infecting devices so as to prevent detection of the Botnet itself.[76] This is why despite several apparently successful attempts at taking down the Kelihos Botnet, it continued to\n\nREVISITING DUE DILIGENCE IN CYBERSPACE\n\nWe harp on two points here. First, cybersecurity capacities vary drastically across States.80 The same conduct cannot generally be expected between so-called \"developed\" countries, \"developing\" and \"least developed\" (LDC) countries;81 or even between countries in comparable socio-economic brackets or the same region—given that their cyber capacities against particular threats can differ substantially.82 Second, to reiterate, due diligence requires highly factual assessments.83 Thus, to allege violations of due diligence, target States would have to prove that the concerned State of origin possessed the capacity to detect, mitigate or prevent transboundary Botnet-related harm in relation to the specific Botnet at hand.84\nDespite differences of capacity, some authors argue that there are certain measures for which any State should be presumed as capable—by the very virtue of being a State, such as the creation of legislations to penalize cybercrime.85 However, even the creation of regulations and corresponding enforcement agencies requires financial and technical investments.86 Therefore, the contents, scope and effectiveness of such domestic regimes may vary depending on State capacity, without violating due diligence. Therefore, one must be cautious when asserting any supposedly universal expectations under due diligence. At the same time, as State capacity advances, the standard of diligent conduct would also advance commensurably.87 Hence, if a State previously lacking cybercrime police, Botnet detection or mitigation techniques later\n\nABHIJEET SHRIVASTAVA AND RUDRAKSH LAKRA\nadvances to these ends, it would owe target States due diligence obligations thereafter. Yet one is compelled to wonder if the evidentiary burden of a State to prove these variable factors may become self-defeating, negating the promising potential of due diligence in establishing State responsibility.\n## Evidentiary concerns\nIn proving the aforementioned facts, three considerations must be examined separately: the 'burden', 'method' and 'standard' of proof. The burden of proof concerns whether certain facts must be proven by a particular party—as per the ICJ, the party alleging due diligence violations must prove the necessary facts. The method of proving facts can either comprise direct or indirect evidence. In Nicaragua v. Costa Rica, the ICJ showed preference for direct scientific evidence, at least on the question of whether the harm alleged over the San Huan river was \"significant\". Yet in Corfu Channel, the ICJ allowed \"liberal recourse\" to inferences from indirect (circumstantial) evidence proving Albania's knowledge of the placing of mines on its territory. This was because any direct evidence would have been in Albania's exclusive control. Analogizing, some authors argue that States litigating against cyber operations would face similar evidentiary obstacles, and thus, courts should be amenable to circumstantial digital evidence.\nHowever, even so, in Corfu Channel, the ICJ only found for the United Kingdom since its set of indirect evidence left \"no room for reasonable doubt\". This is the 'standard' of proof—i.e., the extent to which the Court must be persuaded as to the existence of facts. In later cases where the opposing State's direct evidence contradicted the available circumstantial evidence, this standard was not met for the ICJ. This, in effect means that if States of origin are able to provide direct evidence contradicting the indirect evidence of target States on any count, the latter's case would likely fall. Crucially moreover, in Bosnian Genocide, the Court held that it would apply a higher standard of proof for charges of \"exceptional gravity\"—in that case, concerning the genocide prohibition. With regard to proving due diligence allegations on factual significant harm in se, the Court has not indicated a precise standard of proof. Yet at least for cases where applicant States found their submissions on due diligence as a measure of compliance for primary norms, the standards of proof may shift based on the \"gravity\" of the allegations.\nFinally, it should be acknowledged that the ICJ in Pulp Mills was asked by Argentina to grant similar flexibilities as in Corfu Channel; although the Court found no need to inquire into the request since it did not consider Argentina evidentially disadvantaged. Moreover, to reiterate,\n Michael P.

While these challenges are certainly formidable, we hesitate to dismiss our preference for due diligence. First, the high standard of proof applied to presentations of circumstantial evidence would affect submissions on any norm violation in cyberspace, not just due diligence. This would include attempts to attribute private actions to States of origin, the tests for which are in any case extremely stringent. Accordingly and second, due diligence would help avoid impunity by facilitating indirect responsibility at least in certain cases. This is especially for cases where the State of origin manifestly takes none or negligible efforts against the private group—i.e., it enabled the Botnet's administration by its unwillingness to act for whatever reason.\nTo reiterate, it could be difficult to prove violations of due diligence expectations that heavily hinge on State capacity (such as Botnet takedowns). Perhaps, even proving the \"risk\" of \"significant\" harm could pose difficulties, as we discuss in Triggers for due diligence obligations. Nevertheless, there would be recourse at least when States of origin attempt unilateral measures against Botnets that could have potential impacts on other States. The target State could argue that a prior \"impact assessment\" should necessarily be held—so as to examine if \"significant\" harm may result from the measure. Indeed, in Nicaragua v. Costa Rica, the ICJ found that Costa Rica violated this procedural requirement, even though it also considered that there was no risk of significant harm at the time. As we elaborate in Impact Assessment Obligations Around Botnets, it is arguable that in conducting such impact assessments, the potentially affected States must be consulted, thus maximizing inter-State cooperation. In any case, when a risk of significant harm is found, the obligation to notify and co-operate with the other States would be triggered. Albania's omission to respect this very obligation was what entitled the United Kingdom for full compensation for the damage inflicted on its warships.

In any case, the differential standard of conduct it imposes also protects the interests of States for whom higher expectations would have formed an \"undue burden\". Thus, on balance, this regime should remain until and unless distinct opinio juris arises in this regard. This backdrop having been set; we now turn to the spectrum of due diligence obligations specifically applicable to the context of Botnets.\n# TRIGGERS FOR DUE DILIGENCE OBLIGATIONS\nThis Section elaborates two conditions for different obligations under due diligence to apply: first, that the risk of harm should be significant, and second, that the State of origin must possess 'knowledge' of such risk. The first difficulty arises in defining which forms of harms posed by Botnets would be \"significant\".\n# Significant harms from Botnets\nAs regards factual significant harm, the ILC has argued that assessments of harm must be amenable to \"fast evolving technology\". While declining to provide clear metrics for measuring \"significance\", it argued that such harm can be somewhere between \"detectable and substantial\"—including harm to persons, property or the environment. As we shall elaborate, Botnets may cause tangible or intangible harm, to hardware, software, data and persons. A two-fold inquiry may be carried out concerning intrinsic or instrumental harm—for example, the ICJ examined whether the discharge of sediments into the San Huan river could in itself amount to significant harm against Nicaraguan territory, or if it could cause consequences amounting to such harm, such as the extinction of its fish species. In examining this, the Court considered the scale, magnitude and context of Costa Rica's road construction project.\nThe first acknowledgement then is that not every Botnet is as such harmful—for instance, their use might be for innocuous purposes not amounting to harm, or at a low \"scale\". Theoretically, it is possible that despite infecting millions of devices (having a high scale), the Botnet only spreads harmless spam (having little magnitude), or that the devices are clearly secure against the effects the Botnets seeks to cause (in the context of these devices, it does not pose a risk of harm). Yet it is also possible that despite infecting only a few hundred devices, it may cause\n ILC Articles on Responsibility of States Articles 31, 34–38.\n Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 3 [3], [17], [12], [13], [11], [16]; Coco and de Souza Dias (n 20) 'Cyber Due Diligence': A Patchwork of Protective Obligations in International Law, 787-88; Buchan (n 20) Cyberspace, Non-State Actors and the Obligation to Prevent Transboundary Harm 443; Bannelier-Christakis (n 20) Cyber Diligence: A Low-Intensity Due Diligence Principle for Low-Intensity Cyber Operations? 37; Couzigou (n 62) Securing cyber space: the obligation of States to prevent harmful international cyber operations 47.\n Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 3 [11].\n Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 2 [4].\n Coco and de Souza Dias (n 20) 'Cyber Due Diligence': A Patchwork of Protective Obligations in International Law 793.\n Certain Activities Carried out by Nicaragua in the Border Area (Costa Rica v Nicaragua) and Construction of a Road in Costa Rica along the San Juan River (Nicaragua v Costa Rica) (Merits) [2015] ICJ Rep 200 [155], [192]–[217].\n ibid. [192], [208]\n Ahmad (n 71) Why Botnets Persist: Designing Effective Technical and Policy Interventions 7–8.\n The ICJ has previously examined whether the object in question would indeed be prone to a harmful impact; see Pulp Mills [211].\nREVISITING DUE DILIGENCE IN CYBERSPACE\n\nThe assessment of intrinsic harm is complicated when the effects take other forms, such as against the confidentiality of the data of the device. Consider the Corfu Channel conception of due diligence, which we argued in The relevance of due diligence for cyberspace as attaching due diligence to other primary norms (a violation of another international norm is presupposed as \"significant harm\"). The breach of confidentiality could involve the leak, deletion, or threats to interfere with data. Some authors consider all such intrusions as arbitrary interferences with the primary norm of the right to privacy. Others argue that States' positive obligation to protect human rights (which would include privacy) is one of due diligence. Yet others contend, though not without opponents, that this obligation applies extraterritorially—i.e., a State of origin would owe it to affected device-holders present in the target State. Reading these views together, could one argue that every Botnet that affects the confidentiality of devices attracts the State of origin's due diligence obligations? While technically arguable, it could impose an undue burden on States given the sheer frequency of \"low-intensity\" cyber operations—and go against the logic that negligible harm is excluded from due diligence. This dilemma, in informal terms, puts due diligence in an awkward position.\nThe analysis would perhaps be clearer depending on the nature of the data, whether it forms part of \"critical\" infrastructure, the scale of mass data deletion; or to come to \"instrumental\" harms, the concrete effects on human life and property resulting from the Botnet—such as causing financial losses, the rigging of ballot machines to distort votes, manipulating stock markets by using algorithmic trading from the Bots, spreading hate speech on mass scales to\n Kim Zetter, 'An Unprecedented Look at Stuxnet, the World's First Digital Weapon' (Wired, 3 Nov 2014) <https: 11=\"\" 2014=\"\" countdown-to-zero-day-stuxnet=\"\" www.wired.com=\"\"></https:> accessed 15 May 2022.\n David Kushner, 'The Real Story of Stuxnet' (IEE Spectrum, 23 February 2013) <https: spectrum.ieee.org=\"\" the-real-story-of-stuxnet=\"\" the-real-story-of-stuxnet=\"\"></https:> accessed 1 July 2022; Saleh Soltan, Prateek Mittal, and H.

Yet even instrumental effects would require close attention in particular cases. For example, whether mass disinformation campaigns run through Botnets, in the context of pandemics, elections or otherwise could be considered “significant” would necessarily depend on the facts and empirics of each case. Such factors could include the scale of the Botnet, the nature of the disinformation, and the social context at hand.\nFrom this long discussion, we conclude the following. First, that a variety of distinct cyber threats posed by Botnets may give rise to risks of significant transboundary harm. Second, at the same time, it is crucial for States to elaborate their views on what forms of cyber threats they consider as such harms, whether intrinsically or instrumentally, given that many cases presently involve ambiguity. Third, in any case, the examination of a risk of significant harm would necessarily be a case-to-case basis test. The same goes for the potential effects of any response measures that States of origin may wish to take against transboundary Botnets, which we elaborate in Mitigating or preventing Botnet-related harms. These complications are why, in Impact assessment obligations around Botnets, we emphasize the need for respecting the obligation to conduct an “impact assessment” to examine if significant harm may arise from Botnet response measures that could potentially affect other States.\n# The state of origin's knowledge\nIt is crucial that a great majority of due diligence obligations: that to notify potentially affected States of the risk of significant harm from private or its own activities; and to co-operate with them in order to mitigate, minimize or prevent such harm, all take for granted that the State of origin knows of the existence of this risk. Such knowledge can be either actual or constructive, the latter meaning that in the circumstances of a case, a diligent State ought to or can be presumed to have known of the risk. As examples, in Corfu Channel, the constant surveillance of Albanian forces close to areas where mines were placed indicated its constructive knowledge as to the presence of the mines; while in Bosnian Genocide, the fact that international bodies and other States continually expressed concerns that genocide may transpire was taken to prove Serbia and Montenegro's constructive knowledge to that effect. Thus, for example, a State of origin's knowledge can be presumed if its own cyber infrastructure was frequently exploited by the private Botnet. Alternatively, as has often been the case, if the target State, other States or private actors publicize the existence of a harmful Botnet, the aforesaid obligations of the State of origin would activate.\n Coco, and de Souza Dias (n 30) Cyber due diligence in international law 77; HRC, 'Report of the independent international fact-finding mission on Myanmar' (12 September 2018) UN Doc.

Later in Mitigating or preventing Botnet-related harms, we finally address the specific conduct expected of States of States once the trigger thresholds described in Triggers for due diligence obligations are met.\nHowever, before that stage, we begin in this Section by unpacking the earlier stage where there is a preliminary risk of harm to other States—yet it remains uncertain whether the risked harm could be \"significant\". In such situations, we argue that States of origin must conduct impact assessments to examine whether there is a risk of \"significant\" harm from the Botnet or their response measures. First, we outline the contents of the obligation to conduct impact assessments as also an inexhaustive list of factors that these assessments should consider against contemporary Botnets. Second, we discuss impact assessment techniques employed by States thus far and their interplay with differential State capacities. Finally, we elaborate certain miscellaneous questions as to the scope of this obligation that require the urgent attention of States.\n# Setting the law and context\nThe ICJ has recognized that in case of a preliminary risk of harm, States are customarily bound to conduct impact assessments to discover if the concerned harm could be \"significant\". If such a risk becomes apparent, the State of origin must notify and consult the potentially affected States and take measures to mitigate the potential harm. Upon discovering suspicious Botnets, a \"preliminary risk\" of this nature must be presupposed given their inherent potential for malicious uses, as described in Significant Harms From Botnets. There is also a frequent affirmation of the need for prior impact assessments in cyberspace. For example, in reference to due diligence, the Council of Europe considers that States must assess if a \"disruption or interference\n Buchan (n 20) Cyberspace, Non-State Actors and the Obligation to Prevent Transboundary Harm 443; Bannelier-Christakis (n 20) Cyber Diligence: A Low-Intensity Due Diligence Principle for Low-Intensity Cyber Operations? 37; Couzigou (n 62) Securing cyber space: the obligation of States to prevent harmful international cyber operations 47.\n O.

This is also echoed in other instruments, such as the European Union data protection framework.\nStates of origin will be obligated to conduct impact assessments in two cases: first, to understand if Botnets administered in their jurisdiction pose threats to other States; and second, to appreciate any risk of significant harm that their proposed response measures against the Botnet may pose to target States. Indeed, without proper vigilance, States of origin could inadvertently harm the integrity and functionality of foreign devices, which may even include other States' critical digital infrastructure.\nThe ICJ appreciates that States have discretion in deciding the exact modalities of these impact assessments; however, the assessment must account for the \"nature and magnitude\" of the transboundary activity, its likely adverse impact on States, and the need to \"exercise due diligence\" in its conduct. The ILC has taken a similar position, while elaborating that the likely effects on persons, property and environment of the States should be considered, as we described in Significant harms from Botnets. In any event, the assessment should be rooted in \"scientific\" evidence. Based on these legal compulsions and our research on contemporary Botnets, the following are some inexhaustive factors that could inform an effective impact assessment. Needless to add, future Botnets may evolve such that these factors prove inadequate to examine their activities. Our analysis only serves to illustrate the rigor that ought to be expected from States.\nFirst, examining the 'size' of the Botnet (the number of Bots) can indicate the potency of its threat and its unique geographical spread, which may necessitate international co-operation. Relatedly, determining the locations of foreign devices can enable measures such as notifying users in order to remove malwares from the devices. Second, inquiring the precise activities pursued by the Botnets can indicate the nature of harm they could cause, as described in Significant harms from Botnets. In fact, Botnets are frequently used to earn revenue by illegal activities such as mass spam or theft. Thus, to meaningfully counter the threat of Botnets in the long-term, it is imperative to cut such streams of revenue that serve as incentives\n Council of Europe, 'Recommendation CM/Rec (2011)8 of the Committee of Ministers to member states on the protection and promotion of the universality, integrity and openness of the Internet' (21 September 2011) <https: cm=\"\" pages=\"\" result_details.aspx?objectid=\"09000016805cc2f8\" search.coe.int=\"\"> accessed 1st July 2022; Council of Europe, 'Explanatory Memorandum to the draft Recommendation CM/Rec(2011)... of the Committee of Ministers to member states on the protection and promotion of Internet's universality, integrity and openness', (CM Documents, CM(2011)115–add1, 24 August 2011) <https: cm=\"\" pages=\"\" result_details.aspx?objectid=\"09000016805ccaeb\" search.coe.int=\"\"> accessed 1 July 2022 [79].\n ibid.\n Stockburger (n 104) Control and Capabilities Test: Toward a New Lex Specialis Governing State Responsibility for Third Party Cyber Incidents 259–60.\n Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 90.\n Pulp Mills [205]; Certain Activities Carried out by Nicaragua in the Border Area (Costa Rica v Nicaragua) and Construction of a Road in Costa Rica along the San Juan River (Nicaragua v Costa Rica) (Merits) [2015] ICJ Rep 200 [104].\n Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 7 [7]–[8].\n Boyle (n 101) Developments in the International Law of Environmental Impact Assessments and their Relation to the Espoo Convention 230.\n Mayra Rosario Fuentes and other, 'The Future of P2P IoT Botnets' (Trend Micro, 11 March 2021) <https: 21=\"\" en_in=\"\" ec=\"\" c=\"\" the-future-of-p2p-iot-botnets.html=\"\" research=\"\" www.trendmicro.com=\"\"> accessed 1 July 2022; Ben Dickson, 'IoT botnets might be the cybersecurity industry's next big worry' (IOT Security Foundation, 12 July 2016) <https: 07=\"\" 12=\"\" 2016=\"\" bdtechtalks.com=\"\" iot-botnets-might-be-the-cybersecurity-industrys-next-big-worry=\"\"></https:> accessed 1 July 2022; Shailaja Shankar, 'Ghosts of Botnets Past, Present, and Future' (McAfee, 17 December 2018) <https: blogs=\"\" internet-security=\"\" ghosts-of-botnets-past-present-and-future=\"\" www.mcafee.com=\"\"></https:> accessed 1 July 2022.\n Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 26–28.\n BBC (n 73); Zeitlin (n 72) Botnet Takedowns and the Fourth Amendment, 753–754.\n Ogu and others (n 10) A Botnets Circumspection: The Current Threat Landscape, and What We Know So Far 11–12.</https:></https:></https:>\nREVISITING DUE DILIGENCE IN CYBERSPACE\n\n## Differential capacities for assessment techniques\nOperationalizing the aforementioned factors requires recourse to one or a combination of various methods—categorized as ‘passive’ or ‘active’ techniques. On the facts of each Botnet, one technique might be more strategically appropriate than the other. Passive techniques are relatively stealthier and do not interfere with the Botnets directly, such as analysis of spam records, and anti-virus software feedback; though we do not elaborate all such techniques in this article. Active techniques in contrast are relatively more intrusive but offer greater accuracy and reliability in their findings. In construing ‘diligence’, States possessing capacities to deploy either forms of technique may be obligated to determine and utilize the technique most appropriate against a particular Botnet, or at least attempt to do so.\nAn example of active technique is the method of sinkholing—which involves the redirection of Bots from the Botmaster’s malicious domain servers to law enforcement-controlled domain servers. This technique, which is also characterized as a Domain Name System (DNS) approach, takes for granted that States have a certain amount of technical and financial resources. It also necessitates cooperation with DNS operators, most of whom would be private actors; in the event of their refusal to co-operate, sinkholing can only be pursued if the operators can be legally compelled to that end. Yet that takes for granted the presence of a legal framework that criminalizes cybercriminal acts such as Botnets, enabling the State to compel co-operation. As recently as 2020, it was found in a survey of 194 countries that around 27 countries do not even possess such laws. The situation is worsened in the event that the DNS operator, service provider or corporation is not subject to the State of origin’s enforcement jurisdiction—in which case co-operation with other States would also have to be pursued to proceed. Evidently, toward States of origin presently lacking these necessary capacities, it would be an “undue burden” to expect sophisticated sinkholing techniques. Even in respect of passive techniques such as analyses of spam records, there is a need for certain minimal capacities for\n Ahmad (n 71) Why Botnets Persist: Designing Effective Technical and Policy Interventions 29–31.\n Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 30–31.\n Ogu and others (n 10) A Botnets Circumspection: The Current Threat Landscape, and What We Know So Far 9.\n Supra Sub-section Factors Affecting Standard Of Conduct\n Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 40–78.\n ibid. 40–53, 77–78.\n ibid.\n ibid.\n ibid. 53–65, 77–78.\n ibid. 54–57; Zeitlin (n 72) Botnet Takedowns and the Fourth Amendment 753–754.\n Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 76.\n ibid. 76, 109–110; Asaf Lubin, and João Marinotti, ‘Why Current Botnet Takedown Jurisprudence Should Not Be Replicated’ (Lawfare, 21 Wed 2021) <https: \"bulletproof\"=\"\" 1=\"\" 2022;=\"\" 21=\"\" 2022;=\"\" 2022;=\"\" 21=\"\" 471,=\"\" 471.=\"\" 71.=\"\" <https:=\"\" ag=\"\" alishanda-ransomware-banking-trojans-information-stealers=\"\" blog=\"\" bulletproof-hosting-yalishanda-ransomware-banking-trojans-information-stalers»=\"\" http:=\"\" infel471.com=\"\" international=\"\" international=\"\" infel4711=\"\" blog=\"\" telecommunications=\"\" union,=\"\" www.lawfareblog.com=\"\"> accessed 1 May 2022.\n International Telecommunications Union, Global Cybersecurity Index 2020 Measuring commitment to cybersecurity (ITU Publications 2020) vii.\n Lubin (n 45) The Prohibition on Extraterritorial Enforcement Jurisdiction in the Datasphere.</https:>\nABHIJEET SHRIVASTAVA AND RUDRAKSH LAKRA\nfiltering out malicious content from benign content. Such capacities, in turn, would most likely be uneven across States, especially those within the LDC group.\nA related factor is that the pursuit of impact assessment methods as described above often requires high technical know-how, for which past experiences in tackling Botnets are crucial. An accepted indicator of these capabilities is whether a State possesses a National or Sectoral Cyber Incident Response Team (CIRT), which fosters a coordinated cybersecurity ecosystem in the State. However, as of 2020, over 63 States did not have National level CIRTs and faced significant barriers in establishing them, given resource deficiencies in institutional knowledge, skills shortages and other factors—especially for LDCs. This strengthens the case for international co-operation between States and private actors alike in capacity-building and intelligence sharing for improving cybersecurity. In the end, this would benefit not only less capable States, but also the international community at large—as capacity-building would enable the former to better discharge their obligations as States of origin, as we shall argue in The obligation toward cyber capacity building. To reiterate, as the technological capabilities of States advance, the rigour expected in their impact assessments would also increase under due diligence. By the same metric, if Botnet threats advance further beyond a State's renewed capabilities, the State would not be faulted for ineffective impact assessments as long as it invests its best efforts.\n## Miscellaneous debates\nBefore proceeding to the next Section on the specific obligations to mitigate and prevent Botnet-related harms, we consider it crucial to outline three unresolved questions as to the scope of the impact assessment obligation. First, some authors have argued for a universal obligation on States to conduct continuous 'monitoring' against cyber threats such as Botnets under due diligence. Seemingly, this connects to the impact assessment stage. In our view, other scholars are correct in responding that general monitoring falls outside its scope, since the obligation is only triggered in the event of a \"preliminary risk\" of harm. Others further argue that this would pose capacity concerns even for developed States, or at least difficulties in making such monitoring conform to human rights safeguards. Yet we further submit that general monitoring\n Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 71–73; Do Le Quoc, André Martin, and Christof Fetzer, 'Scalable and Real-Time Deep Packet Inspection' (IEEE/ACM 6th International Conference on Utility and Cloud Computing, 2013) 446–451.\n Generally, see footnote 191.\n Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 72–74.\n ITU (n 176) Global Cybersecurity Index 2020 131–134.\n ibid. 7.\n Ahmad (n 71) Why Botnets Persist: Designing Effective Technical and Policy Interventions 31–35.\n Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 3 [3], [17], [12], [13], [11], [16]; Coco, and de Souza Dias (n 20) 'Cyber Due Diligence': A Patchwork of Protective Obligations in International Law 787–88; Buchan (n 20) Cyberspace, Non-State Actors and the Obligation to Prevent Transboundary Harm 443; Bannelier-Christakis (n 20) Cyber Diligence: A Low-Intensity Due Diligence Principle for Low-Intensity Cyber Operations? 37.\n ibid.\n O.

Okwori (n 20) The Obligation of Due Diligence and Cyber-Attacks: Bridging the Gap Between Universal and Differential Approaches for States 234.\nREVISITING DUE DILIGENCE IN CYBERSPACE\n\nSecond, it is well-accepted that the necessity to protect an essential state interest (under relevant conditions) can preclude the wrongfulness of an illegal act, such as violations of due diligence. We raise this point given that States of origin may often be faced with Botnet threats that necessitate an imminent takedown response, in which case conducting an impact assessment may become impracticable. The issue, however, is that necessity imposes a stringent test, one that has never been met before the ICJ. In this vein, there could be cases where States of origin fail the obligation to conduct impact assessments for reasons that are legitimate but fall below necessity. The ICJ was asked in Nicaragua v. Costa Rica to find that an \"emergency\" situation could preclude the obligation of holding impact assessments; however, the Court avoided this legal question by factually finding that there were no circumstances resembling an emergency. This, therefore, remains a question that ought to be debated and clarified by States in their positions on cyber-law or a future treaty on the subject.\nFinally, it is accepted that once a risk of \"significant\" harm is determined, the State of origin must co-operate and consult potentially affected States in good faith. Yet some consider that inter-State co-operation is crucial even during the prior stage of impact assessments. The basis for this assertion is that an accurate examination of the likely harms cannot be facilitated without co-operation from affected States, given their position to directly appreciate the risk posed to their territory—here, foreign devices infected by the Botnet. This question too was raised in the case of Nicaragua v. Costa Rica but avoided by the ICJ on grounds of judicial economy. Given the ramifications of this question, we hope to see clearer articulations from States as to their co-operation obligations concerning threats such as Botnets. That said, we now turn to the spectrum of obligations triggered once a risk of significant harm does in fact arise.\n# MITIGATING OR PREVENTING BOTNET-RELATED HARMS\nTo reiterate once again, States of origin must use all means at their disposal to prevent or mitigate harm to target States emanating from the former's territory. This due diligence obligation would arise either upon the State's own impact assessment or by constructive knowledge as\n General monitoring which entails deep packet inspection at scale requires significant computing power.

The mitigating measures the State must take depend on the nature of the harm (including its \"seriousness\" and \"likelihood\"), the State's capacity, and other circumstances of the case. The harm in question may result from either the Botnet itself, or through response measures taken by the State of origin against the Botnet. We do not propose that there are specific forms of measures that are universal expectations against any and all Botnets. The purpose of this Section is only to provide an account of contemporary mitigating measures that in our view serve as good practices that depending on the facts, could likely meet the States' due diligence obligations. Like before, we also acknowledge capacity differentials in the discussion.\nWe consider five forms of measures that together could entirely mitigate Botnet-related harms: first, the takeover or takedown of the Botnet, second, the subsequent clean-up of infected devices, third, the fixing of software or hardware vulnerabilities that allowed the Botnet's propagation, fourth, the arrest and prosecution of the Botmaster, and finally, efforts against any financial incentives that may have led to the creation of the Botnets.\nBeginning categorically, the takedown of Botnets involves identifying the gaps in the Botnet's functioning and architecture to thereafter disable or bring it down. This measure requires tremendous technical and financial wherewithal as it involves a specialized response to each unique Botnet; it is challenging even for developed States and major private corporations. Despite this, it might only provide a fleeting control since the Botmaster would resist takedowns using defence and contingencies. Given this, Microsoft's takedowns have failed so often that it has begun instead referring to these attempts as Botnet \"disruptions\". To illustrate further, Microsoft botched its attempt to takedown the ZeroAccess Botnet owing to its omission to account for the P2P structure of the Botnet, meaning that the malware on devices was self-executing—and did not respond to a command server. Alternatively, Botnets can often have multiple command servers, and the failure to eradicate all such servers has previously enabled their resurgence. Clearly, the nature, architecture and protocols of the Botnet could necessitate careful strategies. Thus, it would be absurd to consider Botnet takedowns or takeovers as a universal expectation from even States of origin with high cyber capabilities, let alone developing States and LDCs. There is a need for inter-State and private-State cooperation for collective capacity-building efforts in this regard.\nAs to the second measure, even if a State of origin somehow manages to takedown Botnets—it should attempt to disinfect or clean the malware left on affected devices if the State possesses the necessary capacity. This is because the malware leftovers also pose great risks to the \"stability and behaviour\" of the devices. In fact, in the Conflicker Botnet, the leftover malware of the Botnet disabled the security and update mechanisms of five million affected devices. It is also possible for such leftover malware to join the devices as part of a new Botnet.\n\nREVISITING DUE DILIGENCE IN CYBERSPACE\n\nA second method to clean-up malware is for law enforcement to unilaterally command the Bots to delete the malware on the infected computers, akin to the United States approach against the Coreflood Botnet and Microsoft's against the Citadel Botnets in 2013. The third method involves unilaterally patching the flaw in the security system of the devices that facilitated the installation of malware to begin with. Apart from being measures that only highly technologically advanced States could be expected to pursue, both these methods carry strong privacy concerns owing to their disregard for user consent. This may also allow law enforcement to gain unconsented access to personal data, highlighting the need for human-rights centric legal frameworks regulating Botnet-response measures. These unilateral measures could also cause unforeseen side effects and should therefore be contemplated cautiously. A State of origin proposing such measures would be bound to conduct prior impact assessments as detailed in Impact assessment obligations around Botnets; as also to co-operate with the potentially affected States. If it undertakes unilateral Botnet takedown or malware clean-up measures that result in significant harm to devices in other States, without having taken appropriate steps to mitigate such harm, it would be in violation of its due diligence obligations.\nAs to the remaining common measures, the fixing of software or hardware vulnerabilities that enabled the Botnet's propagation is crucial to improve cybersecurity resilience, such that a similar Botnet does not emerge in the future. The arrest and prosecution of Botmasters would ensure that the same cybercriminals do not rebuild the Botnet once taken down, while\n BBC (n 73).\n Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 110; Ahmad (n 71) Why Botnets Persist: Designing Effective Technical and Policy Interventions 12–13.\n Wei Meng et and others, 'DNS Changer Remediation Study' (Presentation at the Messaging, Malware, and Mobile Anti-Abuse Working Group 27th General Meeting 7, 19 February 2013) <https: GeorgiaTech_DNSChanger_study-2013-02-19.pdf=\"\" files=\"\" news=\"\" www.m3aawg.org=\"\"> accessed 1 July 2022.\n Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 111. ibid, page 93.\n Zeitlin (n 72) 753–54.\n Brian Krebs, 'FBI Scrubbed 19,000 PCs Snared by Coreflood Botnet' (Krebs On Security, 21 June 2011) <https: attacks-breaches=\"\" microsoft-fails-to-nuke-zeroaccess-botnet=\"\" www.darkreading.com=\"\"> accessed 1 July 2022.\n In 2013 after sinkholing Citadel botnets used its command infrastructure to update the malware on infected computers.

Finally, any financial or similar incentives that may have motivated the creation of the Botnets should be targeted, since even if the Botmasters are not arrested, there would be little reason to rebuild the Botnet absent such motives.\nAgain, capacity differentials would determine whether these measures are obligatory on a State or mere suggestions. Yet one commonality across all is the need for international co-operation in their success—cyber capabilities can only flourish best with collective efforts; arrests and prosecutions of transnational cybercriminals can only concretize with mutual legal assistance; and the social evils enabling Botnets eradicated with concerted diplomatic initiatives. It seems then, that due diligence is not only a gap-filling legal arsenal against Botnets amidst the presently mutually suspicious State relations in cyberspace; instead, due diligence must also be viewed as a norm that can realize its maximal potential only in a milieu where States develop robust co-operative and consultative efforts. In that vein, it may well become a vehicle for facilitating internationalism in cyberspace, in line with its core logic. This brings us to the final Section of this article, where we detail the overarching obligation of all States toward cyber capacity building, as also the role of international co-operation in its fruition.\n# THE OBLIGATION TOWARD CYBER CAPACITY BUILDING\nAs previously discussed in Factors affecting standard of conduct and The state of origin's knowledge, the obligation of due diligence is a 'duty of conduct'; yet that carries within it an obligation which is a 'duty of result.' This obligation is to build a 'minimum' institutional capacity that would allow States to effectively carry out their due diligence obligations. This framework should equip the State to be able to detect potential significant harm and to take appropriate mitigating measures to minimize and prevent the harm. This aspect of due diligence has been recognized by the ILC and ICJ. For capacity building, States should make reasonable efforts to create an ability to detect risk, and the capability to mitigate and halt that risk. This obligation of result is necessary for the due diligence norms to have any bite. States including South Korea, Canada, the United Kingdom and Australia in their report on incorporating UNGGE non-binding norms have focused on the building of institutional capacity. These have included raising awareness, creating an appropriate legislative framework, creating or strengthening departments for countering cyber threats, developing incident response plans and domestic policy, and enabling cooperative partnerships—both domestic and international. As with other due diligence obligations, the minimum baseline that is expected of States would differ based\n ibid 121.\n Ahmad (n 71) Why Botnets Persist: Designing Effective Technical and Policy Interventions, 29–31.\n Supra Section on Impact Assessment Obligations Around Botnets\n Fausto Pocar, 'New Challenges for International Rules Against Cyber-Crime' (2004) 10 European Journal on Criminal Policy and Research 27.\n Ney and Zimmermann (n 18) Cyber-Security beyond the Military Perspective: International Law, Cyberspace, and the Concept of Due Diligence.\n Coco, and de Souza Dias (n 20) 'Cyber Due Diligence': A Patchwork of Protective Obligations in International Law, 788; Russel Buchan, 'Cyberspace, Non-State Actors and the Obligation to Prevent Transboundary Harm' (2019) 21 Journal of Conflict &amp; Security Law (2016) 429, 434–439.\n ibid; ILC, Draft Articles on Prevention Article 3 [15]–[17]; Couzigou (n 62) Securing cyber space: the obligation of States to prevent harmful international cyber operations 50–51.\n Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 3 [14]–[17], Article 5.\n Pulp Mills [197].\n Andraz Kastelic, \"Due Diligence in Cyberspace: Normative Expectations of Reciprocal Protection of International Legal Rights\" (UNIDIR, 2021) <https: due-diligence-cyberspace-normative-expectations-reciprocal-protection-international=\"\" publication=\"\" www.unidir.org=\"\"> accessed 1 June 2022, 10.\n ibid.</https:>\nREVISITING DUE DILIGENCE IN CYBERSPACE\n\nThis Section attempts to provide indicators which States can follow for the process of establishing the capability to detect contemporary Botnets and conduct mitigation efforts. Such indicators would also serve to illustrate the conduct expected from States as technologies and Botnet threats evolve. Further, States are free to design their institutional baseline as long as it is adequate for the harm in question. While being mindful of capacity differentials of States, we divide these baseline measures into six categories: national/sectoral cybersecurity strategies, legal measures, measures focusing on preventing Botnet infection, on early detection of botnets, collaborative measures, and review-related measures.\n## National/Sectoral cybersecurity strategies\nStates have limited resources and regulatory capacities. Due diligence recognizes this central pillar of policymaking and accordingly, it requires states to use their best efforts based on their capabilities. To allocate their resources and the regulatory capacity in an economically efficient manner, States should create a strategy for countering threats akin to Botnets based on a risk-based approach, which would help the State identify threats and security gaps that pose a high risk and those that pose a low risk. Based on this level of risk assessment, the State can focus its resources on priority areas where high-risk vulnerabilities exist. This process can be and should ideally be performed both nationally and sectorally.\nNational cybersecurity strategies should become the cornerstone that guides State measures and initiatives. Special focus should be on strengthening and making their networks more resilient to support critical infrastructure, critical supply chains and major financial institutions. Such a National Cybersecurity strategy can also be developed based on a multi-stakeholder approach as recommended by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). As regards feasibility, the most States should be able to draw up these strategies as it only requires states to take stock of their resources, their regulatory capacity and the landscape of threats faced by them. Indeed, as of 2020, the ITU found that 127 countries out of 194 countries have now adopted a National Cyber Strategy.\n## Legal measures\nA suitable legal and regulatory framework is the bedrock of due diligence. As the ILC in their Draft Articles on Transboundary Harm notes, “[s]tates concerned shall take the necessary legislative, administrative or other action…”. The legal framework should lay out relevant rights\n Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 3 [12]–[13] 17; Coco, and de Souza Dias (n 20) Cyber Due Diligence: A Patchwork of Protective Obligations in International Law 787-88; Buchan (n 20) Cyberspace, Non-State Actors and the Obligation to Prevent Transboundary Harm 443; Bannelier-Christakis (n 20) Cyber Diligence: A Low-Intensity Due Diligence Principle for Low-Intensity Cyber Operations? 37; Couzigou (n 62) Securing cyber space: the obligation of States to prevent harmful international cyber operations 47.\n Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 3 [11].\n Coco, and de Souza Dias (n 20) Cyber Due Diligence: A Patchwork of Protective Obligations in International Law, 787-88.\n OECD, OECD Regulatory Policy Outlook 2021: Risk-based regulation (OECD Publishing, 2021).\n Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 3 [3], [5].\n ITU, 'ITU Botnet Mitigation Toolkit' (Jan 2008) ITU Telecommunication Development Sector <https: cyp=\"\" itub-cyb=\"\" cyp/ecybersecurity=\"\" docs=\"\" itu-botnet-mitigation-toolkit-background.pdf=\"\" www.itu.int=\"\"> accessed 1 July 2022, 25; Shackelford, Russell and Kuehn (n 84) Unpacking the International Law on Cybersecurity Due Diligence: Lessons from the Public and Private Sectors 34-42.\n Coco, and de Souza Dias (n 30) Cyber due diligence in international law 187-190.\n ITU (n 176) Global Cybersecurity Index 2020 145-47; ITU (n 243) Botnet Mitigation Toolkit 25.\n ibid.\n ibid.\n ibid.\n Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 5.</https:>\nABHIJEET SHRIVASTAVA AND RUDRAKSH LAKRA\nand responsibilities clearly for State and private parties, and the sanctions and remedies in case of a breach. Such a framework would provide foresight to those subject to it and promote deterrence. In connection to Botnets, any legal framework should attempt to meet two objectives: first, it should clearly criminalize the operation of a Botnet and second, it should provide tools to law enforcement, and other State bodies to effectively investigate and take enforcement actions against Botnets. Attempts at facilitating such legal frameworks can take guidance from prevailing international and regional standards.\nTurning first to criminalization, the criminalizing law should capture the range of crimes committed by Botnets; these include both ‘core’ cybercrime and ‘cyber-enabled’ crimes. States should ensure that the definition of the crimes adopted by the law should not be such that it succumbs to obsolescence very soon with technological changes. A possible approach for this is to define cyber-criminal activities at a high level of abstraction, which would also cover crimes unforeseeable at the time. This is in line with the approach in the Budapest Convention. Further in line with the Budapest Convention and other such initiatives, it is important to push for creating a uniform and common legislative baseline framework across jurisdictions, so that Botmasters could not exploit any difference in laws in different countries. In this regard, there is presently wide disagreement between States about the precise content of crimes beyond core crimes, as presently seen in ongoing debates under the UN’s auspices around a cybercrime treaty. This disagreement limits the possibility of harmonization, and thus, one hopes that a representative consensus is reached.\nRegarding the second proposed objective for laws, as Lubin explains, using existing domestic legal remedies such as injunction orders can be inappropriate for Botnet mitigation. Thus, the law should provide remedies and procedural tools which accommodate the uniqueness of cyberspace and facilitate suitable resources tailored for Botnet mitigation. The question of which procedural tools law enforcement should have can again be resolved by drawing from international standards. There is also a need to build regulatory capacity in a manner that Botnet mitigation operations could be approved at a quicker pace and the body adjudicating these requests is well versed in the specific practical and technical details. Having a quicker turnaround period is important as Botnets are constantly evolving. Consequently, responses against them can quickly become antiquated.\n Coco, and de Souza Dias (n 30) Cyber due diligence in international law 171.\n ibid.\n Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 121–22, 125, 127; ITU (n 243) Botnet Mitigation Toolkit 21–31.\n For instance see, Convention on Cybercrime (adopted 23 Nov 2001, entered into force 1 July 2004) 2296 UNTS 167; Arab Convention on Combating Information Technology Offences (adopted 21 December 2010); African Union Convention on Cyber Security and Personal Data Protection (adopted 27 June 2014); UNODC, ‘Second session of the Ad Hoc Committee’ (Second session of the Ad Hoc Committee to Elaborate a Comprehensive International Convention on Countering the Use of Information and Communications Technologies for Criminal Purposes, 2022) <https: ad_hoc_committee=\"\" chc-second-session.html=\"\" en=\"\" www.unodc.org=\"\"> accessed 1 July 2022; ITU (n 243) Botnet Mitigation Toolkit.\n Gerard (n 6) Botnet Mitigation and International Law 226.\n ibid.\n ibid.\n Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 25.\n Tomaso Falchetta, Deborah Brown and Katitza Rodriguez, ‘Opening Stages in UN Cybercrime Treaty Talks Reflect Human Rights Risks’ (Just Security, 18 April 2022) <https: 81105=\"\" apri=\"\" opening-stages-in-un-cybercrime-treaty-talks-reflect-human-rights-risks=\"\" www.justsecurity.org=\"\"></https:> accessed 30 June 2022.\n Lubin, and Marinotti (n 175) Why Current Botnet Takedown Jurisprudence Should Not Be Replicated.\n For instance see, Convention on Cybercrime (adopted 23 Nov 2001, entered into force 1 July 2004) 2296 UNTS 167; Arab Convention on Combating Information Technology Offences (adopted 21 Dec 2010); African Union Convention on Cyber Security and Personal Data Protection (adopted 27 June 2014); UNODC, ‘Second session of the Ad Hoc Committee’ (Second session of the Ad Hoc Committee to Elaborate a Comprehensive International Convention on Countering the Use of Information and Communications Technologies for Criminal Purposes, 2022) <https: ad_hoc_committee=\"\" chc-second-session.html=\"\" en=\"\" www.unodc.org=\"\"> accessed 1 July 2022; ITU (n 243) Botnet Mitigation Toolkit.\n Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 116, 126.\n ibid.</https:></https:>\nREVISITING DUE DILIGENCE IN CYBERSPACE\n\nA final observation is required for the question of the State's capacity to undertake legal and regulatory measures. Some authors have argued that all states are presumably capable of creating such a framework. However, as we highlighted in Factors affecting standard of conduct and Differential capacities for assessment techniques, even creating cybercrime legislation tailored to the threat of Botnet would require financial and technical investments. To reiterate, as of 2020, 27 countries out of 194 surveyed by ITU did not have any cybercrime-specific legislations. Moreover, even if States had cyber-specific legislations, having an adequate regulatory capacity to enforce it could be particularly challenging for LDCs and certain developing states, as discussed earlier.\n## Measures for preventing Botnet infections\nPreventive efforts against Botnets can be much more effective than combating Botnet-related threats once the Botnet mushrooms into harmful scales. If proactive measures are undertaken to this end, the creation of Botnets, and potentially their potency can be limited if and when States deploy Botnet mitigation measures as described in Mitigating or preventing Botnet-related harms. One way to limit the operation and spread of Botnets is to minimize and prevent the infection of devices. There are primarily two methods through which contemporary Botnets can infect devices—first, by exploiting the vulnerabilities in the software, hardware or firmware used by the devices or second, by social engineering.\nThe first method of propagation of malware can be limited first by regulating the suppliers of ICT products in requiring them to follow baseline security measures based on best practices. For this, States such as China, Japan, the United Kingdom, Germany, South Africa and Brazil have focused on technical standards, verification, certification or accreditation schemes. Moreover, similar to the harmonization of criminal provisions, there is a need for inter-State dialogue on global baseline security practice. This is because Botnets frequently infect devices across a tremendous number of States—for instance, the Mirai botnet infected Botnets in around 85 countries. States, particularly LDCs and developing States that do not have the\n ibid. 111.\n Coco, and de Souza Dias (n 30) Cyber due diligence in international law 137.\n Privacy International, 'Guide to International Law and Surveillance' (Privacy International, Dec 2021) <https: 2021%20gils%20version%203.0_0.pdf=\"\" default=\"\" files=\"\" sites=\"\" www.privacyinternational.org=\"\"> accessed 1 July 2022.\n Supra Sub-section on Factors Affecting Standard Of Conduct and Sub-section on Differential Capacities For Assessment Techniques.\n ITU (n 176) Global Cybersecurity Index 2020 vii.\n Supra Sub-section on Differential Capacities For Assessment Techniques.\n Ahmad (n 71) Why Botnets Persist: Designing Effective Technical and Policy Interventions, 26–27; Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 123.\n ibid.\n ibid.\n Ahmad (n 71) Why Botnets Persist: Designing Effective Technical and Policy Interventions, 26–27.\n ibid.; Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 123; ITU (n 243) Botnet Mitigation Toolkit.\n Coco, and de Souza Dias (n 30) Cyber due diligence in international law 181–186.\n ibid.\n Ahmad (n 71) Why Botnets Persist: Designing Effective Technical and Policy Interventions, 26–27.</https:>\nABHIJEET SHRIVASTAVA AND RUDRAKSH LAKRA\ncapacity to build their own security standards, can benefit from the best practices publicized by international and regional organizations. Further, the vulnerabilities in ICT products can be tackled by carrying out cybersecurity awareness campaigns that focus on end-user awareness to ensure that users keep their software and firmware up to date and install patches. Widespread adoption of baseline security practice could make it exacting for Botmasters to infect secured devices and it would limit the proportion of unsecured devices. Infecting secured devices would require more investment, and if it is more than the expected financial return, the financial incentive for Botmasters to create Botnets at all could be curtailed.\nTurning to the second manner in which Botnets generally propagate—social engineering—it is a method that involves manipulating the end users into committing errors for evading their device security. This is a psychological manipulation technique aiming to manoeuvre users into making security lapses, so as to gain unauthorised access to users' private information, devices, or valuables. However, this method too can be challenged by carrying out cybersecurity awareness campaigns that focus on building tech-literacy, particularly regarding the malware-spreading mechanisms and methods of social engineering. These campaigns should focus more on private companies as end-users, given that they have greater financial resources generally than individual end-users, and particularly small and medium enterprises which are more vulnerable.\nA capacity-building measure that would be common as a defense for both methods of Botnet propagation is conducting extensive cybersecurity awareness programs. These programs require financial bandwidth to fund campaigns, and technical expertise since trained professionals are needed to spearhead them. Comprehensive public cybersecurity campaigns are arduous for developing and LDC countries. For instance, the ITU Cybersecurity Index revealed that more than half of the countries under examination did not have any cybersecurity educational programs or training for professionals. Similarly, a study of cybersecurity awareness for users and executives in Africa found that in the surveyed countries, the lack of such awareness was a major institutional deficiency, necessitating robust programs of this nature.\n## Measures for early detection\nThe obligation of cyber capacity building toward creating a minimum institutional framework also aims at enabling States to detect threats that pose a risk of significant harm. In the case of Botnets, there is a need to create initiatives that focus on their 'early' detection. These can be worked upon by virtue of various mechanisms and initiatives, including some of the presently feasible ones we discuss hereafter.

As we have previously noted, Botnets are by their very nature transnational in scope, and due to their scale can often only be taken down by the cooperation not only between multiple States but also private parties which are involved in the takedown, such as antivirus companies, researchers, ISP and DNS providers and other tech companies. Impact assessment obligations around Botnets and Mitigating or preventing Botnet-related harms explain how conducting an impact assessment and taking mitigation or prevention measures necessitates a multi-stakeholder approach. A concomitant aim should be to build long-term and sustainable collaborations. Currently, private actors are not always given their due importance and inter-State cooperation on criminal matters is burdensome and slow as shown by contemporary mutual legal assistance processes. Consequently, there is a strong need to create\n Ahmad (n 71) Why Botnets Persist: Designing Effective Technical and Policy Interventions 27–29; Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 122.\n Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 121.\n ibid. 121, 95–102; Ahmad (n 71) Why Botnets Persist: Designing Effective Technical and Policy Interventions, 32–33.\n Supra Sub-section on Differential Capacities For Assessment Techniques.\n Ahmad (n 71) Why Botnets Persist: Designing Effective Technical and Policy Interventions, 27–29.\n ibid.; Shuang Hao, Nick Feamster, and Ramakant Pandrangi, 'Monitoring the initial DNS behavior of malicious domains' (IMC '11: Proceedings of the 2011 ACM SIGCOMM conference on Internet measurement conference, November 2011) <https: 2011=\"\" conf2011=\"\" docs=\"\" docx=\"\" p269.pdf=\"\" www.nytimes.com=\"\"> accessed 1 July 2022.\n Supra Sub-section on Differential Capacities For Assessment Techniques.\n Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 121–23, 126–28.\n For instance, see, David E.

Cooperation can even be used to facilitate capacity building in the form of sharing of information, and best practices.\n## Review measures\nFinally, as the ILC has noted in their Draft Articles on Transboundary Harm, “[s]tates concerned shall take the necessary...action including the establishment of suitable monitoring mechanisms to implement...” their due diligence obligations. States can first carry out a review that assesses the potential cyber risks, and the landscape of generally foreseeable threats, such as from growing technical developments. This is critical as expectant conduct under the principle of due diligence should evolve with scientific developments. Second, the review should focus on evaluating the progress the State has made regarding the goals it had set for itself in its national or sectoral cybersecurity policies. Third, the review should audit the adequacy of its overall cybersecurity infrastructure and efforts. Lastly, as the ITU recommends, the State can require entities both public and private to carry out an periodic cybersecurity audit that examines the information system’s security. This can focus on the physical configuration of the systems and software, information handling processes, user practices and environment. Again, all these suggestions must be treated as illustrations of good practices crucial for the maximal fruition of States’ due diligence obligations. We do not propose that these exact measures ought to necessarily be pursued as a matter of duty, especially given capacity differentials—however, these presently serve as some of the best possible examples of conduct the diligence of which could not reasonably be doubted. We are, therefore, hopeful for wider adoption of practices of this rigour.\n## CONCLUSION\nThrough this article, we have reaffirmed the increasing confidence in scholarly views for due diligence as a crucial means of regulating transboundary cyber operations. This faith was concretized through a unique legal and policy study of contemporary Botnets, which are among the gravest threats posed in cyberspace. That said, we demonstrated several cautions toward treating due diligence as a panacea against the Pandora’s box of harms opened by the advent of cyberspace, including for Botnets. This included evidentiary dilemmas that target States may face in proving violations of the norm, particularly given the differential standards of conduct expected of States based on their respective capacities—a nuance that we appreciated in relation to the context of the Botnet concerned, as also the State’s capacity against the specific Botnet concerned.\nYet, we also showed that many of these concerns apply to any international legal norm in the face of the novelties of this terrain. Further, due diligence connotes a spectrum of obligations for which target States may pursue the responsibility of a State of origin. This is from the very first stage of demanding that States conduct an impact assessment in the event of a preliminary\n Ahmad (n 71) Why Botnets Persist: Designing Effective Technical and Policy Interventions 27–29.\n Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 5.\n Shackelford, Russell and Kuehn (n 84) ‘Unpacking the International Law on Cybersecurity Due Diligence: Lessons from the Public and Private Sectors 41–42.\n Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 3 paras [11].\n Shackelford, Russell and Kuehn (n 84) ‘Unpacking the International Law on Cybersecurity Due Diligence: Lessons from the Public and Private Sectors 41–42; ITU (n 176) Global Cybersecurity Index 2020 146.\n ITU (n 176) Global Cybersecurity Index 2020 141.\n ibid.\nREVISITING DUE DILIGENCE IN CYBERSPACE\n\nIn presenting our claims, we have been conscious of the definitional uncertainties that the articulation of due diligence has carried with respect to the 'Corfu Channel' and 'prevention of harm' principles, including in discourse around cyberspace. Yet we argued for a novel coherent conception of due diligence that unifies these principles, providing States and cybersecurity experts much-needed clarity in understanding the scope of its obligations and trigger-thresholds for complex threats such as Botnets. We also outlined various questions with respect to each specific sub-obligation under due diligence that necessitates urgent dialogue between States. In outlining the standards of conduct expected under due diligence, we exposited scientific literature concerning contemporary Botnets, as also several instances of good practices in this context. We are conscious that those illustrations may become anachronistic as technology advances. The point, however, was largely to demonstrate—unlike thus far seen in cyberspace literature—a concrete methodology and guidelines for States to appreciate the precise rigour of diligence that would be required of them against threats like Botnets. To that extent, it is safe to presume that the relevance of these contentions will remain foregrounded for a long time.\nWhile due diligence is indeed a strong legal device to facilitate international co-operation against Botnets, the opposite is equally true. Considering not least the sheer scale of contemporary transboundary Botnets, the fullest and meaningful actualization of due diligence in cyberspace is only possible with greater international co-operation between States and private actors alike, especially for cyber capacity building. Therefore, there remains an urgent need for robust co-operative and consultative efforts against Botnets and similar threats—which in the end, would only be to the collective benefit of the entire international community at large.\n## ACKNOWLEDGEMENT\nThe authors are grateful to Professor Aman for his guidance during their study of cyberspace, and to Professor Sanskriti Sanghi for her feedback and encouragement.",

In existing scholarship, many reasons have informed growing support for the promise of 'due diligence' obligations in regulating transboundary cyber operations. We affirm this position through a study of the specific context of Botnets, although bringing much-needed caution and complexity to the discourse. We offer a comprehensive account of the standard of conduct expected of States in detecting, mitigating and preventing Botnet-linked harms under due diligence; as well as to pursue cyber capacity building toward discharging these obligations. In so doing, we problematize and elaborate on the nature of due diligence as an obligation of conduct, therefore accounting for differential State capacities against Botnet-linked harms. The paper involves attempts to unpack a coherent conception of due diligence, appreciating the spectrum of obligations that it demands, and demonstrating these nuances through an appraisal of good practices adopted by States and private actors against Botnets. Consequently, we provide a unique holistic account of how States and their law enforcement could practically understand the conduct expected of them when faced with transboundary Botnets on a case-to-case basis. In the end, while underscoring potential dilemmas within this legal regime that may be faced by target States, as also its unresolved questions, we submit that due diligence is indeed the most appropriate candidate to act as a legal arsenal against transboundary Botnets.\nKEYWORDS: cyberspace, international law, due diligence, cybersecurity, Botnets.\n# INTRODUCTION\nThe past decades have witnessed unforeseen and unprecedented technological advancements.

Formally defined as an “environment” comprising the “physical and non-physical components” of ICT that transmit data, cyberspace is in practice the closest arena one could informally describe as “borderless”. Yet this terrain brought with it a host of cybersecurity threats, including cybercrime.\nWithin the ecosystem of cybercrime, ‘Botnets’ are the apex species. Botnets refer to a set of compromised devices (Bots) that are controlled by a ‘Botmaster’ usually without the knowledge of device users, typically to carry out a variety of cybercrimes. There is “no practical limit” on the number of devices that Botnets may ‘infect’. For example, the Zeus Botnet has now infected over 13 million devices in 196 countries, causing financial losses of over 120 million USD. Given the decrease in entry barrier costs in the tool kits required to create Botnets, they are now frequently used for cyber-attacks, distributed denial of service attacks (DDOS), ransomware, click fraud, identity theft, and the spread of hate speech, among other threats. Considering their cross-border impact, Botmasters exploit divergences across the domestic legal systems of States to escape accountability. Owing to the vacuum of a globally unified effort against cybercrime, cyber-criminals such as Botmasters seem to enjoy a “safe haven”.\nPresently, there is no major treaty addressing cybercrime, apart from the Convention on Cybercrime (Budapest Convention) which has 66 signatories. Yet even the Budapest Convention has been criticized by many for its narrow set of obligations and its failures to keep up with evolving technology since 2001. As we write, negotiations for drafts of a new treaty on cybercrime are underway under the auspices of the United Nations. However, the scope of this proposed treaty thus far also remains in doubt, and in any case, the extent of its future acceptance would face several obstacles that we discuss hereafter. In summary, there is no effective special law-governing inter-State conduct against cybercrime. Confusion, therefore, prevails as to the legal obligations of States around Botnets and transboundary cyber operations broadly\n Vasileios Karagiannopoulos, *Living With Hacktivism From Conflict to Symbiosis* (Palgrave Macmillan, 2018) 1–13.\n Michael N.

This is a “best efforts” obligation, which would require States to prevent or minimize harm to other States from Botnets that are being administered under their jurisdiction. It would equally cover the cyber responses of States or private actors in their jurisdiction against such Botnets with transboundary effects. In this article, we affirm this position, albeit while problematizing the unconditional optimism that most authors have shown for due diligence. In The relevance of due diligence for cyberspace, we offer a renewed theoretical formulation of due diligence, which is more precise and clearer than existing scholarship. Simultaneously, we consider why this formulation is appropriate for cyberspace and against Botnets. Since due diligence involves “best effort” obligations, we then dive deep into how the standard of conduct expected from each State would vary based on State cyber capacity differentials and the context of the cyber threat. This analysis in Unpacking differential standards of conduct is accompanied by our reflections on the evidentiary dilemmas that States affected by transboundary harm would face in proving breaches of due diligence.\nThereafter, we categorically elaborate the specific obligations demanded by due diligence in relation to Botnets. Triggers for due diligence obligations discuss the trigger points for the majority of due diligence obligations to become applicable. We then discuss obligations concerning the mitigation and prevention of harm that Botnets may cause to other States as well as the role of international cooperation in this regard. In Impact assessment obligations around Botnets, we analyze the obligation to conduct “impact assessments” in case of a preliminary risk of transboundary harm; and in Mitigating or preventing Botnet-related harms, we proceed to mitigation and prevention obligations, while tracing several instances of State and private-led efforts against various Botnets. Finally, we elaborate the obligation of States toward cyber capacity building against Botnet-like threats in The obligation toward cyber capacity building, with extensive discussion of good practices in that context. Across all Sections, while our focus is to concretize existing obligations imposed by due diligence around Botnets, we also detail\n Martin Ney and Andreas Zimmermann, ‘Cyber-Security beyond the Military Perspective: International Law, Cyberspace, and the Concept of Due Diligence’ (2015) 58 German Yearbook of International Law 51.\n Gerard (n 6) Botnet Mitigation and International Law, 191–92.\n Michael N.

Instead, in Reconceiving due diligence, we focus on providing an original and clear theoretical conception of the demands of due diligence. Following this, we briefly discuss in The preference for due diligence the reasons for scholarly confidence in due diligence obligations in the context of cyberspace.\n# Reconceiving due diligence\nTo what end are due diligence obligations designed? Some scholars have differentiated between two allegedly distinct conceptions of due diligence: first, the 'Corfu Channel principle' as emergent from the earliest judgment of the International Court of Justice (ICJ); and second, the 'prevention of harm principle'. Turning to the first, the ICJ in Corfu Channel held that Albania violated international law by failing to notify British Ships that Albanian territorial waters contained a minefield. This was even though Albania itself was not found responsible for laying the said mines. The ICJ also held this to be in breach of the obligation \"not to knowingly allow its territory\" to be \"used for acts contrary to the rights of other States\" [emphasis ours]. Certain authors consider this to mean that due diligence is a 'standard of conduct' which attaches to \"primary\" norms, including in respecting the \"rights\" of other States. For example, in Bosnian genocide, the ICJ held that Serbia and Montenegro violated its duty to prevent genocide in Srebrenica, by failing to exercise \"due diligence\" in using all \"all means reasonably at its disposal\". In this conception, due diligence does not create self-contained obligations, but only serves as a general rubric to measure compliance with other obligations.\nIn parallel, the 'prevention of harm' conception, inter alia, requires States to exercise due diligence so as to prevent or minimize \"significant\" transboundary harm to other States—when such harm originates in their territory. This conception also reflects customary international law, as per the ICJ's judgments in Pulp Mills and Nicaragua v. Costa Rica, which concerned alleged harms to rivers. In this formulation, due diligence does contain self-contained obligations whenever there is a risk of \"significant\" harm. Here, 'significance'\n See generally Heike Krieger, Anne Peters, and Leonhard Kreuzer (eds), Due Diligence in the International Legal Order (OUP, 2020).\n Coco, and de Souza Dias (n 20) Cyber Due Diligence: A Patchwork of Protective Obligations in International Law.\n Corfu Channel (United Kingdom v.

Under the other, even otherwise unprohibited activities become unlawful when resulting in “significant harm”. What then, is the law as it stands? In their positions on how international law applies to cyberspace, many States have highlighted the Corfu Channel conception, while others have supported the prevention of harm conception. Some have instead advanced a singular conception where both the violation of a third State’s rights and “significant harm” need to be conjunctively proven. This is also the approach of the Tallinn Manual 2.0, thus far the most authoritative scholarly text on the law applicable to cyberspace.\nWe regret such inconsistent or incomplete formulations of due diligence by States and scholars alike. We argue that both the Corfu Channel principle and the prevention of harm principle must be construed as part and parcel of a singular due diligence norm. In our conception, due diligence requires the prevention of “significant” transboundary harm. First, when such harm is in violation of any international legal obligation, such as the duty to prevent genocide, the harm must be presumed as significant. However, as we elaborate in *Significant harms from Botnets*, only in the rare event that such an illegal act poses only inconsequential harm, due diligence obligations arguably may not be imposed on States of origin if that would cause an undue burden. Second, in the absence of inherent unlawfulness in the transboundary harm, the significance of the harm can then be examined on a case-to-case basis, using factors that we shall elaborate in Triggers for due diligence obligations. This revised conception has many benefits. One, it coheres two strands of due diligence that have both been recognized by the ICJ. Two, it gives maximal clarity to States seeking to act diligently, as also to States seeking to allege violations of due diligence. Clarity is crucial for any norm to be operational in cyberspace, which is a terrain carrying its own uncertainties. We therefore adopt this two-fold conception of due diligence in the following Sections.\n Certain Activities Carried out by Nicaragua in the Border Area (Costa Rica v Nicaragua) and Construction of a Road in Costa Rica along the San Juan River (Nicaragua v Costa Rica) (Merits) [2015] ICJ Rep 200 [155].\n Coco and de Souza Dias (n 20) ‘Cyber Due Diligence’: A Patchwork of Protective Obligations in International Law, 790.\n ibid.\n Office for Disarmament Affairs, ‘Comments by Member States on the Initial Pre-Draft of the OEWG Report’ (Open-ended Working Group, 2021) <www.un.org disarmament=\"\" open-ended-working-group=\"\"></www.un.org> accessed 1 July 2022 (see individual comments from the Czech Republic and Republic of Korea).\n ‘President of the Republic of Estonia at the opening of CyCon 2019’ (CyCon, 29 May 2019) <https: cjefiles.s3.amazonaws.com=\"\" cgpt=\"\" pdf=\"\" cybernorms=\"\" lawstatements=\"\" remarks+by+the+president+of+the+republic+of+estonia+at+the+opening+of+cycon+2019.pdf=\"\" cech=\"\" cech_rapublic=\"\"> accessed 30 June 2022; Janne Taalas, Ambassador Finland, ‘Statement at the second session of the open-ended Working Group (OEWG) on developments in the field of information and telecommunications in the context of international security’ (Open-ended Working Group, February 2020) <https: 10=\"\" 2018=\"\" ccdcoe.org=\"\" cdc0e=\"\" ccdcoe.org.=\"\" online=\"\" opend=\"\" opend,=\"\" ut=\"\" ut.=\"\" ut.2nd-session-of-oewg.pdf=\"\" uploads=\"\" www.cdci.org=\"\"> accessed 1st July 2022; Organization of American States, ‘Improving Transparency — International Law and State Cyber Operations: Fourth Report (Presented by Prof. Duncan B.

We also take for granted in this article the assertion that all existing international law norms apply to cyberspace, in the absence of new opinio juris to the contrary. Indeed, this is now the majority view in both scholarship and the recent positions of States. The question then naturally arises as to why for addressing harmful cyber operations, including Botnets, in particular, we choose to focus on due diligence when the entire spectrum of international law remains open.\nSeveral reasons justify this choice. First, consider the frequent situations where the Botnet or cyber operation is conducted by private actors. To prove the responsibility of the State where the transboundary harm originates (State of origin), the State affected by such harm (target State) would have to prove that the Botnet's operation is attributable to the State of origin. The attribution of private actions, such as this Botnet, would only arise if the stringent factual test of \"instruction, direction or control\" is met. The test of \"instruction\" has very limited scope, while the joint test of \"direction or control\" requires proof of \"effective control\" over each allegedly wrongful act. The latter test has never been successful before the ICJ, and rarely before other fora. A test that is already onerous is further complicated by the immense difficulties States face in collecting digital evidence of attribution in cyberspace, given, for example, novel masking or spoofing technology. Therefore, proving the violation of other norms, such as the use of force prohibition, is far from feasible—especially for States lacking advanced cyberinfrastructure.\n Coco and de Souza Dias (n 20) 'Cyber Due Diligence': A Patchwork of Protective Obligations in International Law, 790.\n Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons (Advisory Opinion) [1996] ICJ Reps 226 [2]; Pulp Mills [101].\n Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 2 [4], [8].

DILIGENCE IN CYBERSPACE\nWhile some authors raise the continuing debates over the thresholds of other primary norms as another reason to prefer due diligence,58 we do not exaggerate this factor—since as we shall show, concretizing due diligence, including the \"significant\" harm threshold also presents difficulties in cyberspace. Still, due diligence can operate in tandem with those primary norms that contain a preventive or positive effort aspect—such as the positive obligation to prevent genocide,59 protect human rights60 and so forth. In this respect, for failing to take measures against Botnets causing specific kinds of harm, the indirect responsibility of States can be alleged—even when the Botnets are not attributable to the State of origin.61 Furthermore, as we elaborate in Unpacking differential standards of conduct, the conduct expected in due diligence is flexible—responding to the factual context as well as the concerned State's own capacities.62 Therefore, in a terrain such as cyberspace and against the threat of Botnets—both of which are constantly and rapidly evolving, due diligence serves the advantage of accommodating advancements in technology,63 as well as imposing an equitable standard of conduct on the States based on their uneven cyber capabilities.64\nMoreover, as noted in Introduction, there are presently no treaties meaningfully addressing threats such as Botnets. This is, among other reasons, because States have thus far been unwilling to limit their freedoms in ways that may implicate their own policies; as also their hesitations given the unpredictable growths of technology.[65] Yet even if a treaty does arise in the future, we propose that it ought to codify due diligence as aforementioned to operationalize it in cyberspace. Even if it does not, due diligence obligations would co-exist with the treaty obligations, as has been the case previously,[66] unless the treaty provisions conflict with the custom, such that the lex specialis rule is triggered.[67] Finally, as we argue in The obligation toward cyber capacity building, due diligence also imposes a general duty on States toward cyber capacity building, which would enhance cybersecurity worldwide. This capacity building would enable States to detect and mitigate the harms posed by transboundary Botnets, which we elaborate as their obligation in Mitigating or preventing Botnet-related harms. For all these reasons, as international law stands, due diligence is the most appropriate norm for regulating the international response to cyber operations such as Botnets.\n\nABHIJEET SHRIVASTAVA AND RUDRAKSH LAKRA\n# UNPACKING DIFFERENTIAL STANDARDS OF CONDUCT\nThis Section contains one of the most important contributions of this article. It considers an in-depth examination of the implications of due diligence being an obligation of best efforts. First, we discuss a variety of factors to be considered when assessing the standard of conduct expected of States of origin based on their cyber capacity. Simultaneously, we elaborate how the factual context around a concerned cyber threat will affect the State of origin's obligations. Second, we consider if this breath of variable factors may evidently impair a target State's case that a State of origin violated its due diligence obligations. This allows a pragmatic appraisal of the obstacles to establishing State responsibility in inter-State litigation.\n# Factors affecting standard of conduct\nThe obligation to prevent and minimize significant transboundary harm is an obligation of 'conduct' and not of 'result.' As hinted earlier, this means that due diligence requires a State of origin only to utilize the means reasonably available to it to meet this expectation, rather than succeeding at preventing or minimizing harm. Thus, the obligations imposed on States of origin are commensurate with their wherewithal—i.e., their cybersecurity capacities comprising financial, technical and institutional resources.\nConsider the question of technical means. The most prevalent forms of Botnets involve a 'command and control' server which sends instructions to Bots from specific web domains.[71] One method of disabling a Botnet is \"sinkholing\"—here, law enforcement takes control of these web domains, and redirects the Bot traffic to severs under their control.[72] When the Dutch police took over the Bredolab Botnet in 2010, it employed this method and used its server to notify all affected users that their devices had been compromised.[73] Could one then assume that whenever a Botnet emerges, with the Botmaster operating the command server in The Netherlands, the Dutch police can be presumed to have the means to sinkhole the Botnet? The answer is in negative.\nFor example, several Botmasters have employed techniques to generate mass false domain names, owing to which locating the command server becomes arduous.[74] In such cases, concerns arise as to collisions with legitimate domains when law enforcement attempts to target malicious domains.[75] In addition, as seen in the Mariposa Botnet takedown by Spanish authorities, not all Botnets use \"static malware\", meaning that Botmasters can often update the code of the malware infecting devices so as to prevent detection of the Botnet itself.[76] This is why despite several apparently successful attempts at taking down the Kelihos Botnet, it continued to\n\nREVISITING DUE DILIGENCE IN CYBERSPACE\n\nWe harp on two points here. First, cybersecurity capacities vary drastically across States.80 The same conduct cannot generally be expected between so-called \"developed\" countries, \"developing\" and \"least developed\" (LDC) countries;81 or even between countries in comparable socio-economic brackets or the same region—given that their cyber capacities against particular threats can differ substantially.82 Second, to reiterate, due diligence requires highly factual assessments.83 Thus, to allege violations of due diligence, target States would have to prove that the concerned State of origin possessed the capacity to detect, mitigate or prevent transboundary Botnet-related harm in relation to the specific Botnet at hand.84\nDespite differences of capacity, some authors argue that there are certain measures for which any State should be presumed as capable—by the very virtue of being a State, such as the creation of legislations to penalize cybercrime.85 However, even the creation of regulations and corresponding enforcement agencies requires financial and technical investments.86 Therefore, the contents, scope and effectiveness of such domestic regimes may vary depending on State capacity, without violating due diligence. Therefore, one must be cautious when asserting any supposedly universal expectations under due diligence. At the same time, as State capacity advances, the standard of diligent conduct would also advance commensurably.87 Hence, if a State previously lacking cybercrime police, Botnet detection or mitigation techniques later\n\nABHIJEET SHRIVASTAVA AND RUDRAKSH LAKRA\nadvances to these ends, it would owe target States due diligence obligations thereafter. Yet one is compelled to wonder if the evidentiary burden of a State to prove these variable factors may become self-defeating, negating the promising potential of due diligence in establishing State responsibility.\n## Evidentiary concerns\nIn proving the aforementioned facts, three considerations must be examined separately: the 'burden', 'method' and 'standard' of proof. The burden of proof concerns whether certain facts must be proven by a particular party—as per the ICJ, the party alleging due diligence violations must prove the necessary facts. The method of proving facts can either comprise direct or indirect evidence. In Nicaragua v. Costa Rica, the ICJ showed preference for direct scientific evidence, at least on the question of whether the harm alleged over the San Huan river was \"significant\". Yet in Corfu Channel, the ICJ allowed \"liberal recourse\" to inferences from indirect (circumstantial) evidence proving Albania's knowledge of the placing of mines on its territory. This was because any direct evidence would have been in Albania's exclusive control. Analogizing, some authors argue that States litigating against cyber operations would face similar evidentiary obstacles, and thus, courts should be amenable to circumstantial digital evidence.\nHowever, even so, in Corfu Channel, the ICJ only found for the United Kingdom since its set of indirect evidence left \"no room for reasonable doubt\". This is the 'standard' of proof—i.e., the extent to which the Court must be persuaded as to the existence of facts. In later cases where the opposing State's direct evidence contradicted the available circumstantial evidence, this standard was not met for the ICJ. This, in effect means that if States of origin are able to provide direct evidence contradicting the indirect evidence of target States on any count, the latter's case would likely fall. Crucially moreover, in Bosnian Genocide, the Court held that it would apply a higher standard of proof for charges of \"exceptional gravity\"—in that case, concerning the genocide prohibition. With regard to proving due diligence allegations on factual significant harm in se, the Court has not indicated a precise standard of proof. Yet at least for cases where applicant States found their submissions on due diligence as a measure of compliance for primary norms, the standards of proof may shift based on the \"gravity\" of the allegations.\nFinally, it should be acknowledged that the ICJ in Pulp Mills was asked by Argentina to grant similar flexibilities as in Corfu Channel; although the Court found no need to inquire into the request since it did not consider Argentina evidentially disadvantaged. Moreover, to reiterate,\n Michael P.

While these challenges are certainly formidable, we hesitate to dismiss our preference for due diligence. First, the high standard of proof applied to presentations of circumstantial evidence would affect submissions on any norm violation in cyberspace, not just due diligence. This would include attempts to attribute private actions to States of origin, the tests for which are in any case extremely stringent. Accordingly and second, due diligence would help avoid impunity by facilitating indirect responsibility at least in certain cases. This is especially for cases where the State of origin manifestly takes none or negligible efforts against the private group—i.e., it enabled the Botnet's administration by its unwillingness to act for whatever reason.\nTo reiterate, it could be difficult to prove violations of due diligence expectations that heavily hinge on State capacity (such as Botnet takedowns). Perhaps, even proving the \"risk\" of \"significant\" harm could pose difficulties, as we discuss in Triggers for due diligence obligations. Nevertheless, there would be recourse at least when States of origin attempt unilateral measures against Botnets that could have potential impacts on other States. The target State could argue that a prior \"impact assessment\" should necessarily be held—so as to examine if \"significant\" harm may result from the measure. Indeed, in Nicaragua v. Costa Rica, the ICJ found that Costa Rica violated this procedural requirement, even though it also considered that there was no risk of significant harm at the time. As we elaborate in Impact Assessment Obligations Around Botnets, it is arguable that in conducting such impact assessments, the potentially affected States must be consulted, thus maximizing inter-State cooperation. In any case, when a risk of significant harm is found, the obligation to notify and co-operate with the other States would be triggered. Albania's omission to respect this very obligation was what entitled the United Kingdom for full compensation for the damage inflicted on its warships.

In any case, the differential standard of conduct it imposes also protects the interests of States for whom higher expectations would have formed an \"undue burden\". Thus, on balance, this regime should remain until and unless distinct opinio juris arises in this regard. This backdrop having been set; we now turn to the spectrum of due diligence obligations specifically applicable to the context of Botnets.\n# TRIGGERS FOR DUE DILIGENCE OBLIGATIONS\nThis Section elaborates two conditions for different obligations under due diligence to apply: first, that the risk of harm should be significant, and second, that the State of origin must possess 'knowledge' of such risk. The first difficulty arises in defining which forms of harms posed by Botnets would be \"significant\".\n# Significant harms from Botnets\nAs regards factual significant harm, the ILC has argued that assessments of harm must be amenable to \"fast evolving technology\". While declining to provide clear metrics for measuring \"significance\", it argued that such harm can be somewhere between \"detectable and substantial\"—including harm to persons, property or the environment. As we shall elaborate, Botnets may cause tangible or intangible harm, to hardware, software, data and persons. A two-fold inquiry may be carried out concerning intrinsic or instrumental harm—for example, the ICJ examined whether the discharge of sediments into the San Huan river could in itself amount to significant harm against Nicaraguan territory, or if it could cause consequences amounting to such harm, such as the extinction of its fish species. In examining this, the Court considered the scale, magnitude and context of Costa Rica's road construction project.\nThe first acknowledgement then is that not every Botnet is as such harmful—for instance, their use might be for innocuous purposes not amounting to harm, or at a low \"scale\". Theoretically, it is possible that despite infecting millions of devices (having a high scale), the Botnet only spreads harmless spam (having little magnitude), or that the devices are clearly secure against the effects the Botnets seeks to cause (in the context of these devices, it does not pose a risk of harm). Yet it is also possible that despite infecting only a few hundred devices, it may cause\n ILC Articles on Responsibility of States Articles 31, 34–38.\n Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 3 [3], [17], [12], [13], [11], [16]; Coco and de Souza Dias (n 20) 'Cyber Due Diligence': A Patchwork of Protective Obligations in International Law, 787-88; Buchan (n 20) Cyberspace, Non-State Actors and the Obligation to Prevent Transboundary Harm 443; Bannelier-Christakis (n 20) Cyber Diligence: A Low-Intensity Due Diligence Principle for Low-Intensity Cyber Operations? 37; Couzigou (n 62) Securing cyber space: the obligation of States to prevent harmful international cyber operations 47.\n Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 3 [11].\n Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 2 [4].\n Coco and de Souza Dias (n 20) 'Cyber Due Diligence': A Patchwork of Protective Obligations in International Law 793.\n Certain Activities Carried out by Nicaragua in the Border Area (Costa Rica v Nicaragua) and Construction of a Road in Costa Rica along the San Juan River (Nicaragua v Costa Rica) (Merits) [2015] ICJ Rep 200 [155], [192]–[217].\n ibid.

Consider the Corfu Channel conception of due diligence, which we argued in The relevance of due diligence for cyberspace as attaching due diligence to other primary norms (a violation of another international norm is presupposed as \"significant harm\"). The breach of confidentiality could involve the leak, deletion, or threats to interfere with data. Some authors consider all such intrusions as arbitrary interferences with the primary norm of the right to privacy. Others argue that States' positive obligation to protect human rights (which would include privacy) is one of due diligence. Yet others contend, though not without opponents, that this obligation applies extraterritorially—i.e., a State of origin would owe it to affected device-holders present in the target State. Reading these views together, could one argue that every Botnet that affects the confidentiality of devices attracts the State of origin's due diligence obligations? While technically arguable, it could impose an undue burden on States given the sheer frequency of \"low-intensity\" cyber operations—and go against the logic that negligible harm is excluded from due diligence. This dilemma, in informal terms, puts due diligence in an awkward position.\nThe analysis would perhaps be clearer depending on the nature of the data, whether it forms part of \"critical\" infrastructure, the scale of mass data deletion; or to come to \"instrumental\" harms, the concrete effects on human life and property resulting from the Botnet—such as causing financial losses, the rigging of ballot machines to distort votes, manipulating stock markets by using algorithmic trading from the Bots, spreading hate speech on mass scales to\n Kim Zetter, 'An Unprecedented Look at Stuxnet, the World's First Digital Weapon' (Wired, 3 Nov 2014) <https: 11=\"\" 2014=\"\" countdown-to-zero-day-stuxnet=\"\" www.wired.com=\"\"></https:> accessed 15 May 2022.\n David Kushner, 'The Real Story of Stuxnet' (IEE Spectrum, 23 February 2013) <https: spectrum.ieee.org=\"\" the-real-story-of-stuxnet=\"\" the-real-story-of-stuxnet=\"\"></https:> accessed 1 July 2022; Saleh Soltan, Prateek Mittal, and H.

Yet even instrumental effects would require close attention in particular cases. For example, whether mass disinformation campaigns run through Botnets, in the context of pandemics, elections or otherwise could be considered “significant” would necessarily depend on the facts and empirics of each case. Such factors could include the scale of the Botnet, the nature of the disinformation, and the social context at hand.\nFrom this long discussion, we conclude the following. First, that a variety of distinct cyber threats posed by Botnets may give rise to risks of significant transboundary harm. Second, at the same time, it is crucial for States to elaborate their views on what forms of cyber threats they consider as such harms, whether intrinsically or instrumentally, given that many cases presently involve ambiguity. Third, in any case, the examination of a risk of significant harm would necessarily be a case-to-case basis test. The same goes for the potential effects of any response measures that States of origin may wish to take against transboundary Botnets, which we elaborate in Mitigating or preventing Botnet-related harms. These complications are why, in Impact assessment obligations around Botnets, we emphasize the need for respecting the obligation to conduct an “impact assessment” to examine if significant harm may arise from Botnet response measures that could potentially affect other States.\n# The state of origin's knowledge\nIt is crucial that a great majority of due diligence obligations: that to notify potentially affected States of the risk of significant harm from private or its own activities; and to co-operate with them in order to mitigate, minimize or prevent such harm, all take for granted that the State of origin knows of the existence of this risk. Such knowledge can be either actual or constructive, the latter meaning that in the circumstances of a case, a diligent State ought to or can be presumed to have known of the risk. As examples, in Corfu Channel, the constant surveillance of Albanian forces close to areas where mines were placed indicated its constructive knowledge as to the presence of the mines; while in Bosnian Genocide, the fact that international bodies and other States continually expressed concerns that genocide may transpire was taken to prove Serbia and Montenegro's constructive knowledge to that effect. Thus, for example, a State of origin's knowledge can be presumed if its own cyber infrastructure was frequently exploited by the private Botnet. Alternatively, as has often been the case, if the target State, other States or private actors publicize the existence of a harmful Botnet, the aforesaid obligations of the State of origin would activate.\n Coco, and de Souza Dias (n 30) Cyber due diligence in international law 77; HRC, 'Report of the independent international fact-finding mission on Myanmar' (12 September 2018) UN Doc.

Later in Mitigating or preventing Botnet-related harms, we finally address the specific conduct expected of States of States once the trigger thresholds described in Triggers for due diligence obligations are met.\nHowever, before that stage, we begin in this Section by unpacking the earlier stage where there is a preliminary risk of harm to other States—yet it remains uncertain whether the risked harm could be \"significant\". In such situations, we argue that States of origin must conduct impact assessments to examine whether there is a risk of \"significant\" harm from the Botnet or their response measures. First, we outline the contents of the obligation to conduct impact assessments as also an inexhaustive list of factors that these assessments should consider against contemporary Botnets. Second, we discuss impact assessment techniques employed by States thus far and their interplay with differential State capacities. Finally, we elaborate certain miscellaneous questions as to the scope of this obligation that require the urgent attention of States.\n# Setting the law and context\nThe ICJ has recognized that in case of a preliminary risk of harm, States are customarily bound to conduct impact assessments to discover if the concerned harm could be \"significant\". If such a risk becomes apparent, the State of origin must notify and consult the potentially affected States and take measures to mitigate the potential harm. Upon discovering suspicious Botnets, a \"preliminary risk\" of this nature must be presupposed given their inherent potential for malicious uses, as described in Significant Harms From Botnets. There is also a frequent affirmation of the need for prior impact assessments in cyberspace. For example, in reference to due diligence, the Council of Europe considers that States must assess if a \"disruption or interference\n Buchan (n 20) Cyberspace, Non-State Actors and the Obligation to Prevent Transboundary Harm 443; Bannelier-Christakis (n 20) Cyber Diligence: A Low-Intensity Due Diligence Principle for Low-Intensity Cyber Operations? 37; Couzigou (n 62) Securing cyber space: the obligation of States to prevent harmful international cyber operations 47.\n O.

Guidelines on conducting risk assessments have also been provided by the United States National Institute of Standards and Technology, and the institute's guidelines are taken as baselines by the United Kingdom, Japan, Estonia, Korea, Israel and Germany. This is also echoed in other instruments, such as the European Union data protection framework.\nStates of origin will be obligated to conduct impact assessments in two cases: first, to understand if Botnets administered in their jurisdiction pose threats to other States; and second, to appreciate any risk of significant harm that their proposed response measures against the Botnet may pose to target States. Indeed, without proper vigilance, States of origin could inadvertently harm the integrity and functionality of foreign devices, which may even include other States' critical digital infrastructure.\nThe ICJ appreciates that States have discretion in deciding the exact modalities of these impact assessments; however, the assessment must account for the \"nature and magnitude\" of the transboundary activity, its likely adverse impact on States, and the need to \"exercise due diligence\" in its conduct. The ILC has taken a similar position, while elaborating that the likely effects on persons, property and environment of the States should be considered, as we described in Significant harms from Botnets. In any event, the assessment should be rooted in \"scientific\" evidence. Based on these legal compulsions and our research on contemporary Botnets, the following are some inexhaustive factors that could inform an effective impact assessment. Needless to add, future Botnets may evolve such that these factors prove inadequate to examine their activities. Our analysis only serves to illustrate the rigor that ought to be expected from States.\nFirst, examining the 'size' of the Botnet (the number of Bots) can indicate the potency of its threat and its unique geographical spread, which may necessitate international co-operation. Relatedly, determining the locations of foreign devices can enable measures such as notifying users in order to remove malwares from the devices. Second, inquiring the precise activities pursued by the Botnets can indicate the nature of harm they could cause, as described in Significant harms from Botnets. In fact, Botnets are frequently used to earn revenue by illegal activities such as mass spam or theft. Thus, to meaningfully counter the threat of Botnets in the long-term, it is imperative to cut such streams of revenue that serve as incentives\n Council of Europe, 'Recommendation CM/Rec (2011)8 of the Committee of Ministers to member states on the protection and promotion of the universality, integrity and openness of the Internet' (21 September 2011) <https: cm=\"\" pages=\"\" result_details.aspx?objectid=\"09000016805cc2f8\" search.coe.int=\"\"> accessed 1st July 2022; Council of Europe, 'Explanatory Memorandum to the draft Recommendation CM/Rec(2011)... of the Committee of Ministers to member states on the protection and promotion of Internet's universality, integrity and openness', (CM Documents, CM(2011)115–add1, 24 August 2011) <https: cm=\"\" pages=\"\" result_details.aspx?objectid=\"09000016805ccaeb\" search.coe.int=\"\"> accessed 1 July 2022 [79].\n ibid.\n Stockburger (n 104) Control and Capabilities Test: Toward a New Lex Specialis Governing State Responsibility for Third Party Cyber Incidents 259–60.\n Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 90.\n Pulp Mills [205]; Certain Activities Carried out by Nicaragua in the Border Area (Costa Rica v Nicaragua) and Construction of a Road in Costa Rica along the San Juan River (Nicaragua v Costa Rica) (Merits) [2015] ICJ Rep 200 [104].\n Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 7 [7]–[8].\n Boyle (n 101) Developments in the International Law of Environmental Impact Assessments and their Relation to the Espoo Convention 230.\n Mayra Rosario Fuentes and other, 'The Future of P2P IoT Botnets' (Trend Micro, 11 March 2021) <https: 21=\"\" en_in=\"\" ec=\"\" c=\"\" the-future-of-p2p-iot-botnets.html=\"\" research=\"\" www.trendmicro.com=\"\"> accessed 1 July 2022; Ben Dickson, 'IoT botnets might be the cybersecurity industry's next big worry' (IOT Security Foundation, 12 July 2016) <https: 07=\"\" 12=\"\" 2016=\"\" bdtechtalks.com=\"\" iot-botnets-might-be-the-cybersecurity-industrys-next-big-worry=\"\"></https:> accessed 1 July 2022; Shailaja Shankar, 'Ghosts of Botnets Past, Present, and Future' (McAfee, 17 December 2018) <https: blogs=\"\" internet-security=\"\" ghosts-of-botnets-past-present-and-future=\"\" www.mcafee.com=\"\"></https:> accessed 1 July 2022.\n Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 26–28.\n BBC (n 73); Zeitlin (n 72) Botnet Takedowns and the Fourth Amendment, 753–754.\n Ogu and others (n 10) A Botnets Circumspection: The Current Threat Landscape, and What We Know So Far 11–12.</https:></https:></https:>\nREVISITING DUE DILIGENCE IN CYBERSPACE\n\n## Differential capacities for assessment techniques\nOperationalizing the aforementioned factors requires recourse to one or a combination of various methods—categorized as ‘passive’ or ‘active’ techniques. On the facts of each Botnet, one technique might be more strategically appropriate than the other. Passive techniques are relatively stealthier and do not interfere with the Botnets directly, such as analysis of spam records, and anti-virus software feedback; though we do not elaborate all such techniques in this article. Active techniques in contrast are relatively more intrusive but offer greater accuracy and reliability in their findings. In construing ‘diligence’, States possessing capacities to deploy either forms of technique may be obligated to determine and utilize the technique most appropriate against a particular Botnet, or at least attempt to do so.\nAn example of active technique is the method of sinkholing—which involves the redirection of Bots from the Botmaster’s malicious domain servers to law enforcement-controlled domain servers. This technique, which is also characterized as a Domain Name System (DNS) approach, takes for granted that States have a certain amount of technical and financial resources. It also necessitates cooperation with DNS operators, most of whom would be private actors; in the event of their refusal to co-operate, sinkholing can only be pursued if the operators can be legally compelled to that end. Yet that takes for granted the presence of a legal framework that criminalizes cybercriminal acts such as Botnets, enabling the State to compel co-operation. As recently as 2020, it was found in a survey of 194 countries that around 27 countries do not even possess such laws. The situation is worsened in the event that the DNS operator, service provider or corporation is not subject to the State of origin’s enforcement jurisdiction—in which case co-operation with other States would also have to be pursued to proceed. Evidently, toward States of origin presently lacking these necessary capacities, it would be an “undue burden” to expect sophisticated sinkholing techniques. Even in respect of passive techniques such as analyses of spam records, there is a need for certain minimal capacities for\n Ahmad (n 71) Why Botnets Persist: Designing Effective Technical and Policy Interventions 29–31.\n Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 30–31.\n Ogu and others (n 10) A Botnets Circumspection: The Current Threat Landscape, and What We Know So Far 9.\n Supra Sub-section Factors Affecting Standard Of Conduct\n Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 40–78.\n ibid. 40–53, 77–78.\n ibid.\n ibid.\n ibid. 53–65, 77–78.\n ibid. 54–57; Zeitlin (n 72) Botnet Takedowns and the Fourth Amendment 753–754.\n Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 76.\n ibid. 76, 109–110; Asaf Lubin, and João Marinotti, ‘Why Current Botnet Takedown Jurisprudence Should Not Be Replicated’ (Lawfare, 21 Wed 2021) <https: \"bulletproof\"=\"\" 1=\"\" 2022;=\"\" 21=\"\" 2022;=\"\" 2022;=\"\" 21=\"\" 471,=\"\" 471.=\"\" 71.=\"\" <https:=\"\" ag=\"\" alishanda-ransomware-banking-trojans-information-stealers=\"\" blog=\"\" bulletproof-hosting-yalishanda-ransomware-banking-trojans-information-stalers»=\"\" http:=\"\" infel471.com=\"\" international=\"\" international=\"\" infel4711=\"\" blog=\"\" telecommunications=\"\" union,=\"\" www.lawfareblog.com=\"\"> accessed 1 May 2022.\n International Telecommunications Union, Global Cybersecurity Index 2020 Measuring commitment to cybersecurity (ITU Publications 2020) vii.\n Lubin (n 45) The Prohibition on Extraterritorial Enforcement Jurisdiction in the Datasphere.</https:>\nABHIJEET SHRIVASTAVA AND RUDRAKSH LAKRA\nfiltering out malicious content from benign content. Such capacities, in turn, would most likely be uneven across States, especially those within the LDC group.\nA related factor is that the pursuit of impact assessment methods as described above often requires high technical know-how, for which past experiences in tackling Botnets are crucial. An accepted indicator of these capabilities is whether a State possesses a National or Sectoral Cyber Incident Response Team (CIRT), which fosters a coordinated cybersecurity ecosystem in the State. However, as of 2020, over 63 States did not have National level CIRTs and faced significant barriers in establishing them, given resource deficiencies in institutional knowledge, skills shortages and other factors—especially for LDCs. This strengthens the case for international co-operation between States and private actors alike in capacity-building and intelligence sharing for improving cybersecurity. In the end, this would benefit not only less capable States, but also the international community at large—as capacity-building would enable the former to better discharge their obligations as States of origin, as we shall argue in The obligation toward cyber capacity building. To reiterate, as the technological capabilities of States advance, the rigour expected in their impact assessments would also increase under due diligence. By the same metric, if Botnet threats advance further beyond a State's renewed capabilities, the State would not be faulted for ineffective impact assessments as long as it invests its best efforts.\n## Miscellaneous debates\nBefore proceeding to the next Section on the specific obligations to mitigate and prevent Botnet-related harms, we consider it crucial to outline three unresolved questions as to the scope of the impact assessment obligation. First, some authors have argued for a universal obligation on States to conduct continuous 'monitoring' against cyber threats such as Botnets under due diligence. Seemingly, this connects to the impact assessment stage. In our view, other scholars are correct in responding that general monitoring falls outside its scope, since the obligation is only triggered in the event of a \"preliminary risk\" of harm. Others further argue that this would pose capacity concerns even for developed States, or at least difficulties in making such monitoring conform to human rights safeguards. Yet we further submit that general monitoring\n Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 71–73; Do Le Quoc, André Martin, and Christof Fetzer, 'Scalable and Real-Time Deep Packet Inspection' (IEEE/ACM 6th International Conference on Utility and Cloud Computing, 2013) 446–451.\n Generally, see footnote 191.\n Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 72–74.\n ITU (n 176) Global Cybersecurity Index 2020 131–134.\n ibid. 7.\n Ahmad (n 71) Why Botnets Persist: Designing Effective Technical and Policy Interventions 31–35.\n Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 3 [3], [17], [12], [13], [11], [16]; Coco, and de Souza Dias (n 20) 'Cyber Due Diligence': A Patchwork of Protective Obligations in International Law 787–88; Buchan (n 20) Cyberspace, Non-State Actors and the Obligation to Prevent Transboundary Harm 443; Bannelier-Christakis (n 20) Cyber Diligence: A Low-Intensity Due Diligence Principle for Low-Intensity Cyber Operations? 37.\n ibid.\n O.

Okwori (n 20) The Obligation of Due Diligence and Cyber-Attacks: Bridging the Gap Between Universal and Differential Approaches for States 234.\nREVISITING DUE DILIGENCE IN CYBERSPACE\n\nSecond, it is well-accepted that the necessity to protect an essential state interest (under relevant conditions) can preclude the wrongfulness of an illegal act, such as violations of due diligence. We raise this point given that States of origin may often be faced with Botnet threats that necessitate an imminent takedown response, in which case conducting an impact assessment may become impracticable. The issue, however, is that necessity imposes a stringent test, one that has never been met before the ICJ. In this vein, there could be cases where States of origin fail the obligation to conduct impact assessments for reasons that are legitimate but fall below necessity. The ICJ was asked in Nicaragua v. Costa Rica to find that an \"emergency\" situation could preclude the obligation of holding impact assessments; however, the Court avoided this legal question by factually finding that there were no circumstances resembling an emergency. This, therefore, remains a question that ought to be debated and clarified by States in their positions on cyber-law or a future treaty on the subject.\nFinally, it is accepted that once a risk of \"significant\" harm is determined, the State of origin must co-operate and consult potentially affected States in good faith. Yet some consider that inter-State co-operation is crucial even during the prior stage of impact assessments. The basis for this assertion is that an accurate examination of the likely harms cannot be facilitated without co-operation from affected States, given their position to directly appreciate the risk posed to their territory—here, foreign devices infected by the Botnet. This question too was raised in the case of Nicaragua v. Costa Rica but avoided by the ICJ on grounds of judicial economy. Given the ramifications of this question, we hope to see clearer articulations from States as to their co-operation obligations concerning threats such as Botnets. That said, we now turn to the spectrum of obligations triggered once a risk of significant harm does in fact arise.\n# MITIGATING OR PREVENTING BOTNET-RELATED HARMS\nTo reiterate once again, States of origin must use all means at their disposal to prevent or mitigate harm to target States emanating from the former's territory. This due diligence obligation would arise either upon the State's own impact assessment or by constructive knowledge as\n General monitoring which entails deep packet inspection at scale requires significant computing power.

The mitigating measures the State must take depend on the nature of the harm (including its \"seriousness\" and \"likelihood\"), the State's capacity, and other circumstances of the case. The harm in question may result from either the Botnet itself, or through response measures taken by the State of origin against the Botnet. We do not propose that there are specific forms of measures that are universal expectations against any and all Botnets. The purpose of this Section is only to provide an account of contemporary mitigating measures that in our view serve as good practices that depending on the facts, could likely meet the States' due diligence obligations. Like before, we also acknowledge capacity differentials in the discussion.\nWe consider five forms of measures that together could entirely mitigate Botnet-related harms: first, the takeover or takedown of the Botnet, second, the subsequent clean-up of infected devices, third, the fixing of software or hardware vulnerabilities that allowed the Botnet's propagation, fourth, the arrest and prosecution of the Botmaster, and finally, efforts against any financial incentives that may have led to the creation of the Botnets.\nBeginning categorically, the takedown of Botnets involves identifying the gaps in the Botnet's functioning and architecture to thereafter disable or bring it down. This measure requires tremendous technical and financial wherewithal as it involves a specialized response to each unique Botnet; it is challenging even for developed States and major private corporations. Despite this, it might only provide a fleeting control since the Botmaster would resist takedowns using defence and contingencies. Given this, Microsoft's takedowns have failed so often that it has begun instead referring to these attempts as Botnet \"disruptions\". To illustrate further, Microsoft botched its attempt to takedown the ZeroAccess Botnet owing to its omission to account for the P2P structure of the Botnet, meaning that the malware on devices was self-executing—and did not respond to a command server. Alternatively, Botnets can often have multiple command servers, and the failure to eradicate all such servers has previously enabled their resurgence. Clearly, the nature, architecture and protocols of the Botnet could necessitate careful strategies. Thus, it would be absurd to consider Botnet takedowns or takeovers as a universal expectation from even States of origin with high cyber capabilities, let alone developing States and LDCs. There is a need for inter-State and private-State cooperation for collective capacity-building efforts in this regard.\nAs to the second measure, even if a State of origin somehow manages to takedown Botnets—it should attempt to disinfect or clean the malware left on affected devices if the State possesses the necessary capacity. This is because the malware leftovers also pose great risks to the \"stability and behaviour\" of the devices. In fact, in the Conflicker Botnet, the leftover malware of the Botnet disabled the security and update mechanisms of five million affected devices. It is also possible for such leftover malware to join the devices as part of a new Botnet.\n\nREVISITING DUE DILIGENCE IN CYBERSPACE\n\nA second method to clean-up malware is for law enforcement to unilaterally command the Bots to delete the malware on the infected computers, akin to the United States approach against the Coreflood Botnet and Microsoft's against the Citadel Botnets in 2013. The third method involves unilaterally patching the flaw in the security system of the devices that facilitated the installation of malware to begin with. Apart from being measures that only highly technologically advanced States could be expected to pursue, both these methods carry strong privacy concerns owing to their disregard for user consent. This may also allow law enforcement to gain unconsented access to personal data, highlighting the need for human-rights centric legal frameworks regulating Botnet-response measures. These unilateral measures could also cause unforeseen side effects and should therefore be contemplated cautiously. A State of origin proposing such measures would be bound to conduct prior impact assessments as detailed in Impact assessment obligations around Botnets; as also to co-operate with the potentially affected States. If it undertakes unilateral Botnet takedown or malware clean-up measures that result in significant harm to devices in other States, without having taken appropriate steps to mitigate such harm, it would be in violation of its due diligence obligations.\nAs to the remaining common measures, the fixing of software or hardware vulnerabilities that enabled the Botnet's propagation is crucial to improve cybersecurity resilience, such that a similar Botnet does not emerge in the future. The arrest and prosecution of Botmasters would ensure that the same cybercriminals do not rebuild the Botnet once taken down, while\n BBC (n 73).\n Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 110; Ahmad (n 71) Why Botnets Persist: Designing Effective Technical and Policy Interventions 12–13.\n Wei Meng et and others, 'DNS Changer Remediation Study' (Presentation at the Messaging, Malware, and Mobile Anti-Abuse Working Group 27th General Meeting 7, 19 February 2013) <https: GeorgiaTech_DNSChanger_study-2013-02-19.pdf=\"\" files=\"\" news=\"\" www.m3aawg.org=\"\"> accessed 1 July 2022.\n Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 111. ibid, page 93.\n Zeitlin (n 72) 753–54.\n Brian Krebs, 'FBI Scrubbed 19,000 PCs Snared by Coreflood Botnet' (Krebs On Security, 21 June 2011) <https: attacks-breaches=\"\" microsoft-fails-to-nuke-zeroaccess-botnet=\"\" www.darkreading.com=\"\"> accessed 1 July 2022.\n In 2013 after sinkholing Citadel botnets used its command infrastructure to update the malware on infected computers.

Finally, any financial or similar incentives that may have motivated the creation of the Botnets should be targeted, since even if the Botmasters are not arrested, there would be little reason to rebuild the Botnet absent such motives.\nAgain, capacity differentials would determine whether these measures are obligatory on a State or mere suggestions. Yet one commonality across all is the need for international co-operation in their success—cyber capabilities can only flourish best with collective efforts; arrests and prosecutions of transnational cybercriminals can only concretize with mutual legal assistance; and the social evils enabling Botnets eradicated with concerted diplomatic initiatives. It seems then, that due diligence is not only a gap-filling legal arsenal against Botnets amidst the presently mutually suspicious State relations in cyberspace; instead, due diligence must also be viewed as a norm that can realize its maximal potential only in a milieu where States develop robust co-operative and consultative efforts. In that vein, it may well become a vehicle for facilitating internationalism in cyberspace, in line with its core logic. This brings us to the final Section of this article, where we detail the overarching obligation of all States toward cyber capacity building, as also the role of international co-operation in its fruition.\n# THE OBLIGATION TOWARD CYBER CAPACITY BUILDING\nAs previously discussed in Factors affecting standard of conduct and The state of origin's knowledge, the obligation of due diligence is a 'duty of conduct'; yet that carries within it an obligation which is a 'duty of result.' This obligation is to build a 'minimum' institutional capacity that would allow States to effectively carry out their due diligence obligations. This framework should equip the State to be able to detect potential significant harm and to take appropriate mitigating measures to minimize and prevent the harm. This aspect of due diligence has been recognized by the ILC and ICJ. For capacity building, States should make reasonable efforts to create an ability to detect risk, and the capability to mitigate and halt that risk. This obligation of result is necessary for the due diligence norms to have any bite. States including South Korea, Canada, the United Kingdom and Australia in their report on incorporating UNGGE non-binding norms have focused on the building of institutional capacity. These have included raising awareness, creating an appropriate legislative framework, creating or strengthening departments for countering cyber threats, developing incident response plans and domestic policy, and enabling cooperative partnerships—both domestic and international. As with other due diligence obligations, the minimum baseline that is expected of States would differ based\n ibid 121.\n Ahmad (n 71) Why Botnets Persist: Designing Effective Technical and Policy Interventions, 29–31.\n Supra Section on Impact Assessment Obligations Around Botnets\n Fausto Pocar, 'New Challenges for International Rules Against Cyber-Crime' (2004) 10 European Journal on Criminal Policy and Research 27.\n Ney and Zimmermann (n 18) Cyber-Security beyond the Military Perspective: International Law, Cyberspace, and the Concept of Due Diligence.\n Coco, and de Souza Dias (n 20) 'Cyber Due Diligence': A Patchwork of Protective Obligations in International Law, 788; Russel Buchan, 'Cyberspace, Non-State Actors and the Obligation to Prevent Transboundary Harm' (2019) 21 Journal of Conflict &amp; Security Law (2016) 429, 434–439.\n ibid; ILC, Draft Articles on Prevention Article 3 [15]–[17]; Couzigou (n 62) Securing cyber space: the obligation of States to prevent harmful international cyber operations 50–51.\n Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 3 [14]–[17], Article 5.\n Pulp Mills [197].\n Andraz Kastelic, \"Due Diligence in Cyberspace: Normative Expectations of Reciprocal Protection of International Legal Rights\" (UNIDIR, 2021) <https: due-diligence-cyberspace-normative-expectations-reciprocal-protection-international=\"\" publication=\"\" www.unidir.org=\"\"> accessed 1 June 2022, 10.\n ibid.</https:>\nREVISITING DUE DILIGENCE IN CYBERSPACE\n\nThis Section attempts to provide indicators which States can follow for the process of establishing the capability to detect contemporary Botnets and conduct mitigation efforts. Such indicators would also serve to illustrate the conduct expected from States as technologies and Botnet threats evolve. Further, States are free to design their institutional baseline as long as it is adequate for the harm in question. While being mindful of capacity differentials of States, we divide these baseline measures into six categories: national/sectoral cybersecurity strategies, legal measures, measures focusing on preventing Botnet infection, on early detection of botnets, collaborative measures, and review-related measures.\n## National/Sectoral cybersecurity strategies\nStates have limited resources and regulatory capacities. Due diligence recognizes this central pillar of policymaking and accordingly, it requires states to use their best efforts based on their capabilities. To allocate their resources and the regulatory capacity in an economically efficient manner, States should create a strategy for countering threats akin to Botnets based on a risk-based approach, which would help the State identify threats and security gaps that pose a high risk and those that pose a low risk. Based on this level of risk assessment, the State can focus its resources on priority areas where high-risk vulnerabilities exist. This process can be and should ideally be performed both nationally and sectorally.\nNational cybersecurity strategies should become the cornerstone that guides State measures and initiatives. Special focus should be on strengthening and making their networks more resilient to support critical infrastructure, critical supply chains and major financial institutions. Such a National Cybersecurity strategy can also be developed based on a multi-stakeholder approach as recommended by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). As regards feasibility, the most States should be able to draw up these strategies as it only requires states to take stock of their resources, their regulatory capacity and the landscape of threats faced by them. Indeed, as of 2020, the ITU found that 127 countries out of 194 countries have now adopted a National Cyber Strategy.\n## Legal measures\nA suitable legal and regulatory framework is the bedrock of due diligence. As the ILC in their Draft Articles on Transboundary Harm notes, “[s]tates concerned shall take the necessary legislative, administrative or other action…”. The legal framework should lay out relevant rights\n Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 3 [12]–[13] 17; Coco, and de Souza Dias (n 20) Cyber Due Diligence: A Patchwork of Protective Obligations in International Law 787-88; Buchan (n 20) Cyberspace, Non-State Actors and the Obligation to Prevent Transboundary Harm 443; Bannelier-Christakis (n 20) Cyber Diligence: A Low-Intensity Due Diligence Principle for Low-Intensity Cyber Operations? 37; Couzigou (n 62) Securing cyber space: the obligation of States to prevent harmful international cyber operations 47.\n Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 3 [11].\n Coco, and de Souza Dias (n 20) Cyber Due Diligence: A Patchwork of Protective Obligations in International Law, 787-88.\n OECD, OECD Regulatory Policy Outlook 2021: Risk-based regulation (OECD Publishing, 2021).\n Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 3 [3], [5].\n ITU, 'ITU Botnet Mitigation Toolkit' (Jan 2008) ITU Telecommunication Development Sector <https: cyp=\"\" itub-cyb=\"\" cyp/ecybersecurity=\"\" docs=\"\" itu-botnet-mitigation-toolkit-background.pdf=\"\" www.itu.int=\"\"> accessed 1 July 2022, 25; Shackelford, Russell and Kuehn (n 84) Unpacking the International Law on Cybersecurity Due Diligence: Lessons from the Public and Private Sectors 34-42.\n Coco, and de Souza Dias (n 30) Cyber due diligence in international law 187-190.\n ITU (n 176) Global Cybersecurity Index 2020 145-47; ITU (n 243) Botnet Mitigation Toolkit 25.\n ibid.\n ibid.\n ibid.\n Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 5.</https:>\nABHIJEET SHRIVASTAVA AND RUDRAKSH LAKRA\nand responsibilities clearly for State and private parties, and the sanctions and remedies in case of a breach. Such a framework would provide foresight to those subject to it and promote deterrence. In connection to Botnets, any legal framework should attempt to meet two objectives: first, it should clearly criminalize the operation of a Botnet and second, it should provide tools to law enforcement, and other State bodies to effectively investigate and take enforcement actions against Botnets. Attempts at facilitating such legal frameworks can take guidance from prevailing international and regional standards.\nTurning first to criminalization, the criminalizing law should capture the range of crimes committed by Botnets; these include both ‘core’ cybercrime and ‘cyber-enabled’ crimes. States should ensure that the definition of the crimes adopted by the law should not be such that it succumbs to obsolescence very soon with technological changes. A possible approach for this is to define cyber-criminal activities at a high level of abstraction, which would also cover crimes unforeseeable at the time. This is in line with the approach in the Budapest Convention. Further in line with the Budapest Convention and other such initiatives, it is important to push for creating a uniform and common legislative baseline framework across jurisdictions, so that Botmasters could not exploit any difference in laws in different countries. In this regard, there is presently wide disagreement between States about the precise content of crimes beyond core crimes, as presently seen in ongoing debates under the UN’s auspices around a cybercrime treaty. This disagreement limits the possibility of harmonization, and thus, one hopes that a representative consensus is reached.\nRegarding the second proposed objective for laws, as Lubin explains, using existing domestic legal remedies such as injunction orders can be inappropriate for Botnet mitigation. Thus, the law should provide remedies and procedural tools which accommodate the uniqueness of cyberspace and facilitate suitable resources tailored for Botnet mitigation. The question of which procedural tools law enforcement should have can again be resolved by drawing from international standards. There is also a need to build regulatory capacity in a manner that Botnet mitigation operations could be approved at a quicker pace and the body adjudicating these requests is well versed in the specific practical and technical details. Having a quicker turnaround period is important as Botnets are constantly evolving. Consequently, responses against them can quickly become antiquated.\n Coco, and de Souza Dias (n 30) Cyber due diligence in international law 171.\n ibid.\n Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 121–22, 125, 127; ITU (n 243) Botnet Mitigation Toolkit 21–31.\n For instance see, Convention on Cybercrime (adopted 23 Nov 2001, entered into force 1 July 2004) 2296 UNTS 167; Arab Convention on Combating Information Technology Offences (adopted 21 December 2010); African Union Convention on Cyber Security and Personal Data Protection (adopted 27 June 2014); UNODC, ‘Second session of the Ad Hoc Committee’ (Second session of the Ad Hoc Committee to Elaborate a Comprehensive International Convention on Countering the Use of Information and Communications Technologies for Criminal Purposes, 2022) <https: ad_hoc_committee=\"\" chc-second-session.html=\"\" en=\"\" www.unodc.org=\"\"> accessed 1 July 2022; ITU (n 243) Botnet Mitigation Toolkit.\n Gerard (n 6) Botnet Mitigation and International Law 226.\n ibid.\n ibid.\n Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 25.\n Tomaso Falchetta, Deborah Brown and Katitza Rodriguez, ‘Opening Stages in UN Cybercrime Treaty Talks Reflect Human Rights Risks’ (Just Security, 18 April 2022) <https: 81105=\"\" apri=\"\" opening-stages-in-un-cybercrime-treaty-talks-reflect-human-rights-risks=\"\" www.justsecurity.org=\"\"></https:> accessed 30 June 2022.\n Lubin, and Marinotti (n 175) Why Current Botnet Takedown Jurisprudence Should Not Be Replicated.\n For instance see, Convention on Cybercrime (adopted 23 Nov 2001, entered into force 1 July 2004) 2296 UNTS 167; Arab Convention on Combating Information Technology Offences (adopted 21 Dec 2010); African Union Convention on Cyber Security and Personal Data Protection (adopted 27 June 2014); UNODC, ‘Second session of the Ad Hoc Committee’ (Second session of the Ad Hoc Committee to Elaborate a Comprehensive International Convention on Countering the Use of Information and Communications Technologies for Criminal Purposes, 2022) <https: ad_hoc_committee=\"\" chc-second-session.html=\"\" en=\"\" www.unodc.org=\"\"> accessed 1 July 2022; ITU (n 243) Botnet Mitigation Toolkit.\n Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 116, 126.\n ibid.</https:></https:>\nREVISITING DUE DILIGENCE IN CYBERSPACE\n\nA final observation is required for the question of the State's capacity to undertake legal and regulatory measures. Some authors have argued that all states are presumably capable of creating such a framework. However, as we highlighted in Factors affecting standard of conduct and Differential capacities for assessment techniques, even creating cybercrime legislation tailored to the threat of Botnet would require financial and technical investments. To reiterate, as of 2020, 27 countries out of 194 surveyed by ITU did not have any cybercrime-specific legislations. Moreover, even if States had cyber-specific legislations, having an adequate regulatory capacity to enforce it could be particularly challenging for LDCs and certain developing states, as discussed earlier.\n## Measures for preventing Botnet infections\nPreventive efforts against Botnets can be much more effective than combating Botnet-related threats once the Botnet mushrooms into harmful scales. If proactive measures are undertaken to this end, the creation of Botnets, and potentially their potency can be limited if and when States deploy Botnet mitigation measures as described in Mitigating or preventing Botnet-related harms. One way to limit the operation and spread of Botnets is to minimize and prevent the infection of devices. There are primarily two methods through which contemporary Botnets can infect devices—first, by exploiting the vulnerabilities in the software, hardware or firmware used by the devices or second, by social engineering.\nThe first method of propagation of malware can be limited first by regulating the suppliers of ICT products in requiring them to follow baseline security measures based on best practices. For this, States such as China, Japan, the United Kingdom, Germany, South Africa and Brazil have focused on technical standards, verification, certification or accreditation schemes. Moreover, similar to the harmonization of criminal provisions, there is a need for inter-State dialogue on global baseline security practice. This is because Botnets frequently infect devices across a tremendous number of States—for instance, the Mirai botnet infected Botnets in around 85 countries. States, particularly LDCs and developing States that do not have the\n ibid. 111.\n Coco, and de Souza Dias (n 30) Cyber due diligence in international law 137.\n Privacy International, 'Guide to International Law and Surveillance' (Privacy International, Dec 2021) <https: 2021%20gils%20version%203.0_0.pdf=\"\" default=\"\" files=\"\" sites=\"\" www.privacyinternational.org=\"\"> accessed 1 July 2022.\n Supra Sub-section on Factors Affecting Standard Of Conduct and Sub-section on Differential Capacities For Assessment Techniques.\n ITU (n 176) Global Cybersecurity Index 2020 vii.\n Supra Sub-section on Differential Capacities For Assessment Techniques.\n Ahmad (n 71) Why Botnets Persist: Designing Effective Technical and Policy Interventions, 26–27; Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 123.\n ibid.\n ibid.\n Ahmad (n 71) Why Botnets Persist: Designing Effective Technical and Policy Interventions, 26–27.\n ibid.; Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 123; ITU (n 243) Botnet Mitigation Toolkit.\n Coco, and de Souza Dias (n 30) Cyber due diligence in international law 181–186.\n ibid.\n Ahmad (n 71) Why Botnets Persist: Designing Effective Technical and Policy Interventions, 26–27.</https:>\nABHIJEET SHRIVASTAVA AND RUDRAKSH LAKRA\ncapacity to build their own security standards, can benefit from the best practices publicized by international and regional organizations. Further, the vulnerabilities in ICT products can be tackled by carrying out cybersecurity awareness campaigns that focus on end-user awareness to ensure that users keep their software and firmware up to date and install patches. Widespread adoption of baseline security practice could make it exacting for Botmasters to infect secured devices and it would limit the proportion of unsecured devices. Infecting secured devices would require more investment, and if it is more than the expected financial return, the financial incentive for Botmasters to create Botnets at all could be curtailed.\nTurning to the second manner in which Botnets generally propagate—social engineering—it is a method that involves manipulating the end users into committing errors for evading their device security. This is a psychological manipulation technique aiming to manoeuvre users into making security lapses, so as to gain unauthorised access to users' private information, devices, or valuables. However, this method too can be challenged by carrying out cybersecurity awareness campaigns that focus on building tech-literacy, particularly regarding the malware-spreading mechanisms and methods of social engineering. These campaigns should focus more on private companies as end-users, given that they have greater financial resources generally than individual end-users, and particularly small and medium enterprises which are more vulnerable.\nA capacity-building measure that would be common as a defense for both methods of Botnet propagation is conducting extensive cybersecurity awareness programs. These programs require financial bandwidth to fund campaigns, and technical expertise since trained professionals are needed to spearhead them. Comprehensive public cybersecurity campaigns are arduous for developing and LDC countries. For instance, the ITU Cybersecurity Index revealed that more than half of the countries under examination did not have any cybersecurity educational programs or training for professionals. Similarly, a study of cybersecurity awareness for users and executives in Africa found that in the surveyed countries, the lack of such awareness was a major institutional deficiency, necessitating robust programs of this nature.\n## Measures for early detection\nThe obligation of cyber capacity building toward creating a minimum institutional framework also aims at enabling States to detect threats that pose a risk of significant harm. In the case of Botnets, there is a need to create initiatives that focus on their 'early' detection. These can be worked upon by virtue of various mechanisms and initiatives, including some of the presently feasible ones we discuss hereafter.

As we have previously noted, Botnets are by their very nature transnational in scope, and due to their scale can often only be taken down by the cooperation not only between multiple States but also private parties which are involved in the takedown, such as antivirus companies, researchers, ISP and DNS providers and other tech companies. Impact assessment obligations around Botnets and Mitigating or preventing Botnet-related harms explain how conducting an impact assessment and taking mitigation or prevention measures necessitates a multi-stakeholder approach. A concomitant aim should be to build long-term and sustainable collaborations. Currently, private actors are not always given their due importance and inter-State cooperation on criminal matters is burdensome and slow as shown by contemporary mutual legal assistance processes.

Cooperation can even be used to facilitate capacity building in the form of sharing of information, and best practices.\n## Review measures\nFinally, as the ILC has noted in their Draft Articles on Transboundary Harm, “[s]tates concerned shall take the necessary...action including the establishment of suitable monitoring mechanisms to implement...” their due diligence obligations. States can first carry out a review that assesses the potential cyber risks, and the landscape of generally foreseeable threats, such as from growing technical developments. This is critical as expectant conduct under the principle of due diligence should evolve with scientific developments. Second, the review should focus on evaluating the progress the State has made regarding the goals it had set for itself in its national or sectoral cybersecurity policies. Third, the review should audit the adequacy of its overall cybersecurity infrastructure and efforts. Lastly, as the ITU recommends, the State can require entities both public and private to carry out an periodic cybersecurity audit that examines the information system’s security. This can focus on the physical configuration of the systems and software, information handling processes, user practices and environment. Again, all these suggestions must be treated as illustrations of good practices crucial for the maximal fruition of States’ due diligence obligations. We do not propose that these exact measures ought to necessarily be pursued as a matter of duty, especially given capacity differentials—however, these presently serve as some of the best possible examples of conduct the diligence of which could not reasonably be doubted. We are, therefore, hopeful for wider adoption of practices of this rigour.\n## CONCLUSION\nThrough this article, we have reaffirmed the increasing confidence in scholarly views for due diligence as a crucial means of regulating transboundary cyber operations. This faith was concretized through a unique legal and policy study of contemporary Botnets, which are among the gravest threats posed in cyberspace. That said, we demonstrated several cautions toward treating due diligence as a panacea against the Pandora’s box of harms opened by the advent of cyberspace, including for Botnets. This included evidentiary dilemmas that target States may face in proving violations of the norm, particularly given the differential standards of conduct expected of States based on their respective capacities—a nuance that we appreciated in relation to the context of the Botnet concerned, as also the State’s capacity against the specific Botnet concerned.\nYet, we also showed that many of these concerns apply to any international legal norm in the face of the novelties of this terrain. Further, due diligence connotes a spectrum of obligations for which target States may pursue the responsibility of a State of origin. This is from the very first stage of demanding that States conduct an impact assessment in the event of a preliminary\n Ahmad (n 71) Why Botnets Persist: Designing Effective Technical and Policy Interventions 27–29.\n Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 5.\n Shackelford, Russell and Kuehn (n 84) ‘Unpacking the International Law on Cybersecurity Due Diligence: Lessons from the Public and Private Sectors 41–42.\n Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 3 paras [11].\n Shackelford, Russell and Kuehn (n 84) ‘Unpacking the International Law on Cybersecurity Due Diligence: Lessons from the Public and Private Sectors 41–42; ITU (n 176) Global Cybersecurity Index 2020 146.\n ITU (n 176) Global Cybersecurity Index 2020 141.\n ibid.\nREVISITING DUE DILIGENCE IN CYBERSPACE\n\nIn presenting our claims, we have been conscious of the definitional uncertainties that the articulation of due diligence has carried with respect to the 'Corfu Channel' and 'prevention of harm' principles, including in discourse around cyberspace. Yet we argued for a novel coherent conception of due diligence that unifies these principles, providing States and cybersecurity experts much-needed clarity in understanding the scope of its obligations and trigger-thresholds for complex threats such as Botnets. We also outlined various questions with respect to each specific sub-obligation under due diligence that necessitates urgent dialogue between States. In outlining the standards of conduct expected under due diligence, we exposited scientific literature concerning contemporary Botnets, as also several instances of good practices in this context. We are conscious that those illustrations may become anachronistic as technology advances. The point, however, was largely to demonstrate—unlike thus far seen in cyberspace literature—a concrete methodology and guidelines for States to appreciate the precise rigour of diligence that would be required of them against threats like Botnets. To that extent, it is safe to presume that the relevance of these contentions will remain foregrounded for a long time.\nWhile due diligence is indeed a strong legal device to facilitate international co-operation against Botnets, the opposite is equally true. Considering not least the sheer scale of contemporary transboundary Botnets, the fullest and meaningful actualization of due diligence in cyberspace is only possible with greater international co-operation between States and private actors alike, especially for cyber capacity building. Therefore, there remains an urgent need for robust co-operative and consultative efforts against Botnets and similar threats—which in the end, would only be to the collective benefit of the entire international community at large.\n## ACKNOWLEDGEMENT\nThe authors are grateful to Professor Aman for his guidance during their study of cyberspace, and to Professor Sanskriti Sanghi for her feedback and encouragement."

In existing scholarship, many reasons have informed growing support for the promise of 'due diligence' obligations in regulating transboundary cyber operations. We affirm this position through a study of the specific context of Botnets, although bringing much-needed caution and complexity to the discourse. We offer a comprehensive account of the standard of conduct expected of States in detecting, mitigating and preventing Botnet-linked harms under due diligence; as well as to pursue cyber capacity building toward discharging these obligations. In so doing, we problematize and elaborate on the nature of due diligence as an obligation of conduct, therefore accounting for differential State capacities against Botnet-linked harms. The paper involves attempts to unpack a coherent conception of due diligence, appreciating the spectrum of obligations that it demands, and demonstrating these nuances through an appraisal of good practices adopted by States and private actors against Botnets. Consequently, we provide a unique holistic account of how States and their law enforcement could practically understand the conduct expected of them when faced with transboundary Botnets on a case-to-case basis. In the end, while underscoring potential dilemmas within this legal regime that may be faced by target States, as also its unresolved questions, we submit that due diligence is indeed the most appropriate candidate to act as a legal arsenal against transboundary Botnets.\nKEYWORDS: cyberspace, international law, due diligence, cybersecurity, Botnets.\n# INTRODUCTION\nThe past decades have witnessed unforeseen and unprecedented technological advancements. The advent of information communication technology (ICT) has birthed a new domain in\n© The Author(s) (2022). Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

In summary, there is no effective special law-governing inter-State conduct against cybercrime. Confusion, therefore, prevails as to the legal obligations of States around Botnets and transboundary cyber operations broadly\n² Vasileios Karagiannopoulos, *Living With Hacktivism From Conflict to Symbiosis* (Palgrave Macmillan, 2018) 1–13.\n³ Michael N.

In The relevance of due diligence for cyberspace, we offer a renewed theoretical formulation of due diligence, which is more precise and clearer than existing scholarship. Simultaneously, we consider why this formulation is appropriate for cyberspace and against Botnets. Since due diligence involves “best effort” obligations, we then dive deep into how the standard of conduct expected from each State would vary based on State cyber capacity differentials and the context of the cyber threat. This analysis in Unpacking differential standards of conduct is accompanied by our reflections on the evidentiary dilemmas that States affected by transboundary harm would face in proving breaches of due diligence.\nThereafter, we categorically elaborate the specific obligations demanded by due diligence in relation to Botnets. Triggers for due diligence obligations discuss the trigger points for the majority of due diligence obligations to become applicable. We then discuss obligations concerning the mitigation and prevention of harm that Botnets may cause to other States as well as the role of international cooperation in this regard. In Impact assessment obligations around Botnets, we analyze the obligation to conduct “impact assessments” in case of a preliminary risk of transboundary harm; and in Mitigating or preventing Botnet-related harms, we proceed to mitigation and prevention obligations, while tracing several instances of State and private-led efforts against various Botnets. Finally, we elaborate the obligation of States toward cyber capacity building against Botnet-like threats in The obligation toward cyber capacity building, with extensive discussion of good practices in that context.

Instead, in Reconceiving due diligence, we focus on providing an original and clear theoretical conception of the demands of due diligence. Following this, we briefly discuss in The preference for due diligence the reasons for scholarly confidence in due diligence obligations in the context of cyberspace.\n# Reconceiving due diligence\nTo what end are due diligence obligations designed? Some scholars have differentiated between two allegedly distinct conceptions of due diligence: first, the 'Corfu Channel principle' as emergent from the earliest judgment of the International Court of Justice²⁵ (ICJ); and second, the 'prevention of harm principle'.²⁶ Turning to the first, the ICJ in Corfu Channel held that Albania violated international law by failing to notify British Ships that Albanian territorial waters contained a minefield.²⁷ This was even though Albania itself was not found responsible for laying the said mines.²⁸ The ICJ also held this to be in breach of the obligation \"not to knowingly allow its territory\" to be \"used for acts contrary to the rights of other States\" [emphasis ours].²⁹ Certain authors consider this to mean that due diligence is a 'standard of conduct' which attaches to \"primary\" norms, including in respecting the \"rights\" of other States.³⁰ For example, in Bosnian genocide, the ICJ held that Serbia and Montenegro violated its duty to prevent genocide in Srebrenica, by failing to exercise \"due diligence\" in using all \"all means reasonably at its disposal\".³¹ In this conception, due diligence does not create self-contained obligations, but only serves as a general rubric to measure compliance with other obligations.³²\nIn parallel, the 'prevention of harm' conception, inter alia, requires States to exercise due diligence so as to prevent or minimize \"significant\" transboundary harm to other States—when such harm originates in their territory.³³ This conception also reflects customary international law, as per the ICJ's judgments in Pulp Mills³⁴ and Nicaragua v. Costa Rica,³⁵ which concerned alleged harms to rivers. In this formulation, due diligence does contain self-contained obligations whenever there is a risk of \"significant\" harm.³⁶ Here, 'significance'\n²⁴ See generally Heike Krieger, Anne Peters, and Leonhard Kreuzer (eds), Due Diligence in the International Legal Order (OUP, 2020).\n²⁵ Coco, and de Souza Dias (n 20) Cyber Due Diligence: A Patchwork of Protective Obligations in International Law.\n²⁶ Corfu Channel (United Kingdom v.

Under the other, even otherwise unprohibited activities become unlawful when resulting in “significant harm”. What then, is the law as it stands? In their positions on how international law applies to cyberspace, many States have highlighted the Corfu Channel conception,⁴⁰ while others have supported the prevention of harm conception.⁴¹ Some have instead advanced a singular conception where both the violation of a third State’s rights and “significant harm” need to be conjunctively proven.⁴² This is also the approach of the Tallinn Manual 2.0,⁴³ thus far the most authoritative scholarly text on the law applicable to cyberspace.\nWe regret such inconsistent or incomplete formulations of due diligence by States and scholars alike. We argue that both the Corfu Channel principle and the prevention of harm principle must be construed as part and parcel of a singular due diligence norm. In our conception, due diligence requires the prevention of “significant” transboundary harm. First, when such harm is in violation of any international legal obligation, such as the duty to prevent genocide, the harm must be presumed as significant. However, as we elaborate in *Significant harms from Botnets*, only in the rare event that such an illegal act poses only inconsequential harm, due diligence obligations arguably may not be imposed on States of origin if that would cause an undue burden. Second, in the absence of inherent unlawfulness in the transboundary harm, the significance of the harm can then be examined on a case-to-case basis, using factors that we shall elaborate in Triggers for due diligence obligations. This revised conception has many benefits. One, it coheres two strands of due diligence that have both been recognized by the ICJ.⁴⁴ Two, it gives maximal clarity to States seeking to act diligently, as also to States seeking to allege violations of due diligence. Clarity is crucial for any norm to be operational in cyberspace, which is a terrain carrying its own uncertainties.⁴⁵ We therefore adopt this two-fold conception of due diligence in the following Sections.\n³⁷ Certain Activities Carried out by Nicaragua in the Border Area (Costa Rica v Nicaragua) and Construction of a Road in Costa Rica along the San Juan River (Nicaragua v Costa Rica) (Merits)  ICJ Rep 200 .\n³⁸ Coco and de Souza Dias (n 20) ‘Cyber Due Diligence’: A Patchwork of Protective Obligations in International Law, 790.\n³⁹ ibid.\n⁴⁰ Office for Disarmament Affairs, ‘Comments by Member States on the Initial Pre-Draft of the OEWG Report’ (Open-ended Working Group, 2021) <www.un.org disarmament=\"\" open-ended-working-group=\"\"></www.un.org> accessed 1 July 2022 (see individual comments from the Czech Republic and Republic of Korea).\n⁴¹ ‘President of the Republic of Estonia at the opening of CyCon 2019’ (CyCon, 29 May 2019) <https: cjefiles.s3.amazonaws.com=\"\" cgpt=\"\" pdf=\"\" cybernorms=\"\" lawstatements=\"\" remarks+by+the+president+of+the+republic+of+estonia+at+the+opening+of+cycon+2019.pdf=\"\" cech=\"\" cech_rapublic=\"\"> accessed 30 June 2022; Janne Taalas, Ambassador Finland, ‘Statement at the second session of the open-ended Working Group (OEWG) on developments in the field of information and telecommunications in the context of international security’ (Open-ended Working Group, February 2020) <https: 10=\"\" 2018=\"\" ccdcoe.org=\"\" cdc0e=\"\" ccdcoe.org.=\"\" online=\"\" opend=\"\" opend,=\"\" ut=\"\" ut.=\"\" ut.2nd-session-of-oewg.pdf=\"\" uploads=\"\" www.cdci.org=\"\"> accessed 1st July 2022; Organization of American States, ‘Improving Transparency — International Law and State Cyber Operations: Fourth Report (Presented by Prof. Duncan B.

First, consider the frequent situations where the Botnet or cyber operation is conducted by private actors. To prove the responsibility of the State where the transboundary harm originates (State of origin), the State affected by such harm (target State) would have to prove that the Botnet's operation is attributable to the State of origin.⁵² The attribution of private actions, such as this Botnet, would only arise if the stringent factual test of \"instruction, direction or control\" is met.⁵³ The test of \"instruction\" has very limited scope, while the joint test of \"direction or control\" requires proof of \"effective control\" over each allegedly wrongful act.⁵⁴ The latter test has never been successful before the ICJ, and rarely before other fora.⁵⁵ A test that is already onerous is further complicated by the immense difficulties States face in collecting digital evidence of attribution in cyberspace, given, for example, novel masking or spoofing technology.⁵⁶ Therefore, proving the violation of other norms, such as the use of force prohibition, is far from feasible⁵⁷—especially for States lacking advanced cyberinfrastructure.\n⁴⁶ Coco and de Souza Dias (n 20) 'Cyber Due Diligence': A Patchwork of Protective Obligations in International Law, 790.\n⁴⁷ Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons (Advisory Opinion)  ICJ Reps 226 ; Pulp Mills .\n⁴⁸ Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 2 , .

some authors raise the continuing debates over the thresholds of other primary norms as another reason to prefer due diligence,58 we do not exaggerate this factor—since as we shall show, concretizing due diligence, including the \"significant\" harm threshold also presents difficulties in cyberspace. Still, due diligence can operate in tandem with those primary norms that contain a preventive or positive effort aspect—such as the positive obligation to prevent genocide,59 protect human rights60 and so forth. In this respect, for failing to take measures against Botnets causing specific kinds of harm, the indirect responsibility of States can be alleged—even when the Botnets are not attributable to the State of origin.61 Furthermore, as we elaborate in Unpacking differential standards of conduct, the conduct expected in due diligence is flexible—responding to the factual context as well as the concerned State's own capacities.62 Therefore, in a terrain such as cyberspace and against the threat of Botnets—both of which are constantly and rapidly evolving, due diligence serves the advantage of accommodating advancements in technology,63 as well as imposing an equitable standard of conduct on the States based on their uneven cyber capabilities.64\nMoreover, as noted in Introduction, there are presently no treaties meaningfully addressing threats such as Botnets. This is, among other reasons, because States have thus far been unwilling to limit their freedoms in ways that may implicate their own policies; as also their hesitations given the unpredictable growths of technology. Yet even if a treaty does arise in the future, we propose that it ought to codify due diligence as aforementioned to operationalize it in cyberspace. Even if it does not, due diligence obligations would co-exist with the treaty obligations, as has been the case previously, unless the treaty provisions conflict with the custom, such that the lex specialis rule is triggered. Finally, as we argue in The obligation toward cyber capacity building, due diligence also imposes a general duty on States toward cyber capacity building, which would enhance cybersecurity worldwide. This capacity building would enable States to detect and mitigate the harms posed by transboundary Botnets, which we elaborate as their obligation in Mitigating or preventing Botnet-related harms. For all these reasons, as international law stands, due diligence is the most appropriate norm for regulating the international response to cyber operations such as Botnets.\n58 Barrie Sander, 'Democracy Under The Influence: Paradigms of State Responsibility for Cyber Influence Operations on Elections' (2019) 18 Chinese Journal of International Law 1, 18-24, 52; Rebecca Crootof, 'International Cyberorts: Expanding State Accountability in Cyberspace' (2018) 103 Cornell Law Review 565.\n59 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (adopted 12 January 1951, entered into force 12 January 1951) 78 UNTS 277 Article 1; Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v Serbia and Montenegro) (Merits)  ICJ Rep (2007) 43 -.\n60 Koivurova (n 30) Due Diligence, .\n61 Schmitt (n 20) In Defense of Due Diligence in Cyberspace.\n62 Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm article 3 , , , , , ; Coco and de Souza Dias (n 20) 'Cyber Due Diligence': A Patchwork of Protective Obligations in International Law 787-88; Buchan (n 20) Cyberspace, Non-State Actors and the Obligation to Prevent Transboundary Harm 443; Bannelier-Christakis (n 20) Cyber Diligence: A Low-Intensity Due Diligence Principle for Low-Intensity Cyber Operations? 37; Iréne Couzigou, 'Securing cyber space: the obligation of States to prevent harmful international cyber operations' (2018) 32 International Review of Law, Computers &amp; Technology 37, 47.\n63 Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm article 3 .\n64 Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm article 3 , , , , , ; Coco and de Souza Dias (n 20) 'Cyber Due Diligence': A Patchwork of Protective Obligations in International Law 787-88; Buchan (n 20) Cyberspace, Non-State Actors and the Obligation to Prevent Transboundary Harm, 443; Bannelier-Christakis (n 20) Cyber Diligence: A Low-Intensity Due Diligence Principle for Low-Intensity Cyber Operations? 37; Couzigou (n 62) Securing cyber space: the obligation of States to prevent harmful international cyber operations 47.\n65 Ney and Zimmermann (n 18) Cyber-Security beyond the Military Perspective: International Law, Cyberspace, and the Concept of Due Diligence.\n6 Certain Activities Carried out by Nicaragua in the Border Area (Costa Rica v Nicaragua) and Construction of a Road in Costa Rica along the San Juan River (Nicaragua v Costa Rica) (Merits)  ICJ Rep 200 .\n67 Akande, Coco and de Souza Dias (n 50) Old Habits Die Hard: Applying Existing International Law in Cyberspace and Beyond; ILC, 'Fragmentation of International Law: Difficulties Arising from the Diversification and Expansion of International Law' (13 April 2006) Report of the Study Group of the International Law Commission Finalized by Martti Koskenniemi, UN Doc A/CN.4/L.682, .\nABHIJEET SHRIVASTAVA AND RUDRAKSH LAKRA\n# UNPACKING DIFFERENTIAL STANDARDS OF CONDUCT\nThis Section contains one of the most important contributions of this article. It considers an in-depth examination of the implications of due diligence being an obligation of best efforts. First, we discuss a variety of factors to be considered when assessing the standard of conduct expected of States of origin based on their cyber capacity. Simultaneously, we elaborate how the factual context around a concerned cyber threat will affect the State of origin's obligations. Second, we consider if this breath of variable factors may evidently impair a target State's case that a State of origin violated its due diligence obligations. This allows a pragmatic appraisal of the obstacles to establishing State responsibility in inter-State litigation.\n# Factors affecting standard of conduct\nThe obligation to prevent and minimize significant transboundary harm is an obligation of 'conduct' and not of 'result.' As hinted earlier, this means that due diligence requires a State of origin only to utilize the means reasonably available to it to meet this expectation, rather than succeeding at preventing or minimizing harm. Thus, the obligations imposed on States of origin are commensurate with their wherewithal—i.e., their cybersecurity capacities comprising financial, technical and institutional resources.\nConsider the question of technical means. The most prevalent forms of Botnets involve a 'command and control' server which sends instructions to Bots from specific web domains. One method of disabling a Botnet is \"sinkholing\"—here, law enforcement takes control of these web domains, and redirects the Bot traffic to severs under their control. When the Dutch police took over the Bredolab Botnet in 2010, it employed this method and used its server to notify all affected users that their devices had been compromised. Could one then assume that whenever a Botnet emerges, with the Botmaster operating the command server in The Netherlands, the Dutch police can be presumed to have the means to sinkhole the Botnet? The answer is in negative.\nFor example, several Botmasters have employed techniques to generate mass false domain names, owing to which locating the command server becomes arduous. In such cases, concerns arise as to collisions with legitimate domains when law enforcement attempts to target malicious domains. In addition, as seen in the Mariposa Botnet takedown by Spanish authorities, not all Botnets use \"static malware\", meaning that Botmasters can often update the code of the malware infecting devices so as to prevent detection of the Botnet itself. This is why despite several apparently successful attempts at taking down the Kelihos Botnet, it continued to\n66 Koivurova (n 30) Due Diligence, –.\n69 Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 3 , .\n70 For this reason, some authors characterize due diligence as an obligation of 'common but differentiated responsibility' (CBDR). However, we avoid this term given its specific connotation in climate change law – where specific obligations are imposed on legally defined \"developed\" countries to assist the capacity-building of \"developing\" countries. As to capacity-building in cyberspace, see Section on Impact Assessment Obligations Around Botnets.

These limited factors suffice to show that at times the very detection of a Botnet may surpass the technical capabilities of a State, let alone a takedown process. Thus, in the absence of knowledge of the Botnet's existence, the obligation to prevent transboundary harm would not even be triggered,79 as we elaborate in Triggers for due diligence obligations.\nWe harp on two points here. First, cybersecurity capacities vary drastically across States.80 The same conduct cannot generally be expected between so-called \"developed\" countries, \"developing\" and \"least developed\" (LDC) countries;81 or even between countries in comparable socio-economic brackets or the same region—given that their cyber capacities against particular threats can differ substantially.82 Second, to reiterate, due diligence requires highly factual assessments.83 Thus, to allege violations of due diligence, target States would have to prove that the concerned State of origin possessed the capacity to detect, mitigate or prevent transboundary Botnet-related harm in relation to the specific Botnet at hand.84\nDespite differences of capacity, some authors argue that there are certain measures for which any State should be presumed as capable—by the very virtue of being a State, such as the creation of legislations to penalize cybercrime.85 However, even the creation of regulations and corresponding enforcement agencies requires financial and technical investments.86 Therefore, the contents, scope and effectiveness of such domestic regimes may vary depending on State capacity, without violating due diligence. Therefore, one must be cautious when asserting any supposedly universal expectations under due diligence. At the same time, as State capacity advances, the standard of diligent conduct would also advance commensurably.87 Hence, if a State previously lacking cybercrime police, Botnet detection or mitigation techniques later\n77 Arsh Arora, 'Kelihos Botnet: A Never-Ending Saga' (Annual ADFSL Conference on Digital Forensics, Security and Law, 2017). <https: commons.erau.edu=\"\" cgi=\"\" cgi?viewcontent.cgi?article=\"1271&amp;context=adfsl\"> accessed 1 July 2022 9.\n78 Ahmad (n 71) Why Botnets Persist: Designing Effective Technical and Policy Interventions 9.\n79 Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 3 para  and ; Coco and de Souza Dias (n 20) 'Cyber Due Diligence': A Patchwork of Protective Obligations in International Law, 793–94.\n80 International Telecommunications Union, Global Cybersecurity Index 2020 Measuring commitment to cybersecurity (ITU Publications 2020); Andrea Calderaro and Anthony J.

Yet one is compelled to wonder if the evidentiary burden of a State to prove these variable factors may become self-defeating, negating the promising potential of due diligence in establishing State responsibility.\n## Evidentiary concerns\nIn proving the aforementioned facts, three considerations must be examined separately: the 'burden', 'method' and 'standard' of proof.⁸⁸ The burden of proof concerns whether certain facts must be proven by a particular party—as per the ICJ, the party alleging due diligence violations must prove the necessary facts.⁸⁹ The method of proving facts can either comprise direct or indirect evidence. In Nicaragua v. Costa Rica, the ICJ showed preference for direct scientific evidence, at least on the question of whether the harm alleged over the San Huan river was \"significant\".⁹⁰ Yet in Corfu Channel, the ICJ allowed \"liberal recourse\" to inferences from indirect (circumstantial) evidence proving Albania's knowledge of the placing of mines on its territory.⁹¹ This was because any direct evidence would have been in Albania's exclusive control.⁹² Analogizing, some authors argue that States litigating against cyber operations would face similar evidentiary obstacles, and thus, courts should be amenable to circumstantial digital evidence.⁹³\nHowever, even so, in Corfu Channel, the ICJ only found for the United Kingdom since its set of indirect evidence left \"no room for reasonable doubt\".⁹⁴ This is the 'standard' of proof—i.e., the extent to which the Court must be persuaded as to the existence of facts.⁹⁵ In later cases where the opposing State's direct evidence contradicted the available circumstantial evidence, this standard was not met for the ICJ.⁹⁶ This, in effect means that if States of origin are able to provide direct evidence contradicting the indirect evidence of target States on any count, the latter's case would likely fall. Crucially moreover, in Bosnian Genocide, the Court held that it would apply a higher standard of proof for charges of \"exceptional gravity\"—in that case, concerning the genocide prohibition.⁹⁷ With regard to proving due diligence allegations on factual significant harm in se, the Court has not indicated a precise standard of proof.⁹⁸ Yet at least for cases where applicant States found their submissions on due diligence as a measure of compliance for primary norms, the standards of proof may shift based on the \"gravity\" of the allegations.⁹⁹\nFinally, it should be acknowledged that the ICJ in Pulp Mills was asked by Argentina to grant similar flexibilities as in Corfu Channel; although the Court found no need to inquire into the request since it did not consider Argentina evidentially disadvantaged.¹⁰⁰ Moreover, to reiterate,\n⁸⁸ Michael P.

It appears unlikely, however, that the Court would depart from its previous approaches.¹⁰²\nConsidering all this, and in light of the differential facts to be proven for asserting a specific standard of conduct as per the previous Sub-Section, one may be inclined to conclude that proving due diligence violations is in fact more difficult than for other norms—contrary to our view in The relevance of due diligence for cyberspace. While these challenges are certainly formidable, we hesitate to dismiss our preference for due diligence. First, the high standard of proof applied to presentations of circumstantial evidence would affect submissions on any norm violation in cyberspace, not just due diligence.¹⁰³ This would include attempts to attribute private actions to States of origin, the tests for which are in any case extremely stringent.¹⁰⁴ Accordingly and second, due diligence would help avoid impunity by facilitating indirect responsibility at least in certain cases.¹⁰⁵ This is especially for cases where the State of origin manifestly takes none or negligible efforts against the private group¹⁰⁶—i.e., it enabled the Botnet's administration by its unwillingness to act for whatever reason.\nTo reiterate, it could be difficult to prove violations of due diligence expectations that heavily hinge on State capacity (such as Botnet takedowns).¹⁰⁷ Perhaps, even proving the \"risk\" of \"significant\" harm could pose difficulties, as we discuss in Triggers for due diligence obligations. Nevertheless, there would be recourse at least when States of origin attempt unilateral measures against Botnets that could have potential impacts on other States. The target State could argue that a prior \"impact assessment\" should necessarily be held—so as to examine if \"significant\" harm may result from the measure.¹⁰⁸ Indeed, in Nicaragua v. Costa Rica, the ICJ found that Costa Rica violated this procedural requirement, even though it also considered that there was no risk of significant harm at the time.¹⁰⁹ As we elaborate in Impact Assessment Obligations Around Botnets, it is arguable that in conducting such impact assessments, the potentially affected States must be consulted, thus maximizing inter-State cooperation. In any case, when a risk of significant harm is found, the obligation to notify and co-operate with the other States would be triggered.¹¹⁰ Albania's omission to respect this very obligation was what entitled the United Kingdom for full compensation for the damage inflicted on its warships.¹¹¹ Therefore,\n¹⁰¹ Alan Boyle, 'Developments in the International Law of Environmental Impact Assessments and their Relation to the Espoo Convention' (2011) 20 Review of European Community &amp; International Environmental Law, 227.\n¹⁰² Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Croatia v.

In any case, the differential standard of conduct it imposes also protects the interests of States for whom higher expectations would have formed an \"undue burden\".¹¹³ Thus, on balance, this regime should remain until and unless distinct opinio juris arises in this regard. This backdrop having been set; we now turn to the spectrum of due diligence obligations specifically applicable to the context of Botnets.\n# TRIGGERS FOR DUE DILIGENCE OBLIGATIONS\nThis Section elaborates two conditions for different obligations under due diligence to apply: first, that the risk of harm should be significant, and second, that the State of origin must possess 'knowledge' of such risk. The first difficulty arises in defining which forms of harms posed by Botnets would be \"significant\".\n# Significant harms from Botnets\nAs regards factual significant harm, the ILC has argued that assessments of harm must be amenable to \"fast evolving technology\".¹¹⁴ While declining to provide clear metrics for measuring \"significance\", it argued that such harm can be somewhere between \"detectable and substantial\"—including harm to persons, property or the environment.¹¹⁵ As we shall elaborate, Botnets may cause tangible or intangible harm, to hardware, software, data and persons.¹¹⁶ A two-fold inquiry may be carried out concerning intrinsic or instrumental harm—for example, the ICJ examined whether the discharge of sediments into the San Huan river could in itself amount to significant harm against Nicaraguan territory, or if it could cause consequences amounting to such harm, such as the extinction of its fish species.¹¹⁷ In examining this, the Court considered the scale, magnitude and context of Costa Rica's road construction project.¹¹⁸\nThe first acknowledgement then is that not every Botnet is as such harmful—for instance, their use might be for innocuous purposes not amounting to harm, or at a low \"scale\".¹¹⁹ Theoretically, it is possible that despite infecting millions of devices (having a high scale), the Botnet only spreads harmless spam (having little magnitude), or that the devices are clearly secure against the effects the Botnets seeks to cause (in the context of these devices, it does not pose a risk of harm).¹²⁰ Yet it is also possible that despite infecting only a few hundred devices, it may cause\n¹¹² ILC Articles on Responsibility of States Articles 31, 34–38.\n¹¹³ Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 3 , , , , , ; Coco and de Souza Dias (n 20) 'Cyber Due Diligence': A Patchwork of Protective Obligations in International Law, 787-88; Buchan (n 20) Cyberspace, Non-State Actors and the Obligation to Prevent Transboundary Harm 443; Bannelier-Christakis (n 20) Cyber Diligence: A Low-Intensity Due Diligence Principle for Low-Intensity Cyber Operations? 37; Couzigou (n 62) Securing cyber space: the obligation of States to prevent harmful international cyber operations 47.\n¹¹⁴ Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 3 .\n¹¹⁵ Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 2 .\n¹¹⁶ Coco and de Souza Dias (n 20) 'Cyber Due Diligence': A Patchwork of Protective Obligations in International Law 793.\n¹¹⁷ Certain Activities Carried out by Nicaragua in the Border Area (Costa Rica v Nicaragua) and Construction of a Road in Costa Rica along the San Juan River (Nicaragua v Costa Rica) (Merits)  ICJ Rep 200 , –.\n¹¹⁸ ibid. ,\n¹¹⁹ Ahmad (n 71) Why Botnets Persist: Designing Effective Technical and Policy Interventions 7–8.\n¹²⁰ The ICJ has previously examined whether the object in question would indeed be prone to a harmful impact; see Pulp Mills .\nREVISITING DUE DILIGENCE IN CYBERSPACE\n333\nharm of alarming proportions—as evident from the Stuxnet worm which interfered with the workings of Iranian nuclear power plants.¹²¹ Suppose that a Botnet is used to launch cyber-attacks with physical effects, where it aims to render the critical infrastructure of a State dysfunctional—the case for such effects as intrinsically significantly harmful is evident.¹²² Indeed, in Nicaragua v. Costa Rica, the Court did indicate that when the harm to an object passes a “sort of critical level”,¹²³ the harm could be significant—integrity is the least controversial measure of this regard.\nThe assessment of intrinsic harm is complicated when the effects take other forms, such as against the confidentiality of the data of the device.¹²⁴ Consider the Corfu Channel conception of due diligence, which we argued in The relevance of due diligence for cyberspace as attaching due diligence to other primary norms (a violation of another international norm is presupposed as \"significant harm\"). The breach of confidentiality could involve the leak, deletion, or threats to interfere with data.¹²⁵ Some authors consider all such intrusions as arbitrary interferences with the primary norm of the right to privacy.¹²⁶ Others argue that States' positive obligation to protect human rights (which would include privacy) is one of due diligence.¹²⁷ Yet others contend, though not without opponents,¹²⁸ that this obligation applies extraterritorially—i.e., a State of origin would owe it to affected device-holders present in the target State.¹²⁹ Reading these views together, could one argue that every Botnet that affects the confidentiality of devices attracts the State of origin's due diligence obligations? While technically arguable, it could impose an undue burden on States given the sheer frequency of \"low-intensity\" cyber operations¹³⁰—and go against the logic that negligible harm is excluded from due diligence.¹³¹ This dilemma, in informal terms, puts due diligence in an awkward position.\nThe analysis would perhaps be clearer depending on the nature of the data, whether it forms part of \"critical\" infrastructure,¹³² the scale of mass data deletion; or to come to \"instrumental\" harms, the concrete effects on human life and property resulting from the Botnet—such as causing financial losses,¹³³ the rigging of ballot machines to distort votes,¹³⁴ manipulating stock markets by using algorithmic trading from the Bots,¹³⁵ spreading hate speech on mass scales to\n¹²¹ Kim Zetter, 'An Unprecedented Look at Stuxnet, the World's First Digital Weapon' (Wired, 3 Nov 2014) <https: 11=\"\" 2014=\"\" countdown-to-zero-day-stuxnet=\"\" www.wired.com=\"\"></https:> accessed 15 May 2022.\n¹²² David Kushner, 'The Real Story of Stuxnet' (IEE Spectrum, 23 February 2013) <https: spectrum.ieee.org=\"\" the-real-story-of-stuxnet=\"\" the-real-story-of-stuxnet=\"\"></https:> accessed 1 July 2022; Saleh Soltan, Prateek Mittal, and H.

Yet even instrumental effects would require close attention in particular cases. For example, whether mass disinformation campaigns run through Botnets, in the context of pandemics,¹³⁷ elections¹³⁸ or otherwise could be considered “significant” would necessarily depend on the facts and empirics of each case.¹³⁹ Such factors could include the scale of the Botnet, the nature of the disinformation, and the social context at hand.¹⁴⁰\nFrom this long discussion, we conclude the following. First, that a variety of distinct cyber threats posed by Botnets may give rise to risks of significant transboundary harm. Second, at the same time, it is crucial for States to elaborate their views on what forms of cyber threats they consider as such harms, whether intrinsically or instrumentally, given that many cases presently involve ambiguity. Third, in any case, the examination of a risk of significant harm would necessarily be a case-to-case basis test. The same goes for the potential effects of any response measures that States of origin may wish to take against transboundary Botnets, which we elaborate in Mitigating or preventing Botnet-related harms. These complications are why, in Impact assessment obligations around Botnets, we emphasize the need for respecting the obligation¹⁴¹ to conduct an “impact assessment” to examine if significant harm may arise from Botnet response measures that could potentially affect other States.\n# The state of origin's knowledge\nIt is crucial that a great majority of due diligence obligations: that to notify potentially affected States of the risk of significant harm from private or its own activities; and to co-operate with them in order to mitigate, minimize or prevent such harm, all take for granted that the State of origin knows of the existence of this risk.¹⁴² Such knowledge can be either actual or constructive, the latter meaning that in the circumstances of a case, a diligent State ought to or can be presumed to have known of the risk.¹⁴³ As examples, in Corfu Channel, the constant surveillance of Albanian forces close to areas where mines were placed indicated its constructive knowledge as to the presence of the mines;¹⁴⁴ while in Bosnian Genocide, the fact that international bodies and other States continually expressed concerns that genocide may transpire was taken to prove Serbia and Montenegro's constructive knowledge to that effect.¹⁴⁵ Thus, for example, a State of origin's knowledge can be presumed if its own cyber infrastructure was frequently exploited by the private Botnet.¹⁴⁶ Alternatively, as has often been the case,¹⁴⁷ if the target State, other States or private actors publicize the existence of a harmful Botnet, the aforesaid obligations of the State of origin would activate.\n¹³⁶ Coco, and de Souza Dias (n 30) Cyber due diligence in international law 77; HRC, 'Report of the independent international fact-finding mission on Myanmar' (12 September 2018) UN Doc.

In the absence of such capacity, neither would the State of origin be capable of apprising itself as to Botnet risks, nor could constructive knowledge be realistically imputed to it.¹⁴⁸ In that event, some have speculated that States may use their capacity deficiencies as excuses to evade the above spectrum of obligations.¹⁴⁹ We address this dilemma later in The obligation toward cyber capacity building of the article, where we submit that due diligence obligates continuous State efforts toward cyber capacity building. In the next Section, we discuss the obligation of States of origin to conduct impact assessments in order to secure knowledge of any risks of significant Botnet-related transboundary harm from their territory.\n# IMPACT ASSESSMENT OBLIGATIONS AROUND BOTNETS\nIn Triggers for due diligence obligations, we outlined the trigger thresholds for the majority of due diligence obligations to apply for a State of origin—knowledge, and the risk of significant transboundary harm. Later in Mitigating or preventing Botnet-related harms, we finally address the specific conduct expected of States of States once the trigger thresholds described in Triggers for due diligence obligations are met.\nHowever, before that stage, we begin in this Section by unpacking the earlier stage where there is a preliminary risk of harm to other States—yet it remains uncertain whether the risked harm could be \"significant\". In such situations, we argue that States of origin must conduct impact assessments to examine whether there is a risk of \"significant\" harm from the Botnet or their response measures. First, we outline the contents of the obligation to conduct impact assessments as also an inexhaustive list of factors that these assessments should consider against contemporary Botnets. Second, we discuss impact assessment techniques employed by States thus far and their interplay with differential State capacities. Finally, we elaborate certain miscellaneous questions as to the scope of this obligation that require the urgent attention of States.\n# Setting the law and context\nThe ICJ has recognized that in case of a preliminary risk of harm, States are customarily bound to conduct impact assessments to discover if the concerned harm could be \"significant\".¹⁵⁰ If such a risk becomes apparent, the State of origin must notify and consult the potentially affected States and take measures to mitigate the potential harm.¹⁵¹ Upon discovering suspicious Botnets, a \"preliminary risk\" of this nature must be presupposed given their inherent potential for malicious uses, as described in Significant Harms From Botnets. There is also a frequent affirmation of the need for prior impact assessments in cyberspace.¹⁵² For example, in reference to due diligence, the Council of Europe considers that States must assess if a \"disruption or interference\n¹⁴⁸ Buchan (n 20) Cyberspace, Non-State Actors and the Obligation to Prevent Transboundary Harm 443; Bannelier-Christakis (n 20) Cyber Diligence: A Low-Intensity Due Diligence Principle for Low-Intensity Cyber Operations? 37; Couzigou (n 62) Securing cyber space: the obligation of States to prevent harmful international cyber operations 47.\n¹⁴⁹ O.

Indeed, without proper vigilance, States of origin could inadvertently harm the integrity and functionality of foreign devices, which may even include other States' critical digital infrastructure.¹⁵⁶\nThe ICJ appreciates that States have discretion in deciding the exact modalities of these impact assessments; however, the assessment must account for the \"nature and magnitude\" of the transboundary activity, its likely adverse impact on States, and the need to \"exercise due diligence\" in its conduct.¹⁵⁷ The ILC has taken a similar position, while elaborating that the likely effects on persons, property and environment of the States should be considered,¹⁵⁸ as we described in Significant harms from Botnets. In any event, the assessment should be rooted in \"scientific\" evidence.¹⁵⁹ Based on these legal compulsions and our research on contemporary Botnets, the following are some inexhaustive factors that could inform an effective impact assessment. Needless to add, future Botnets may evolve such that these factors prove inadequate to examine their activities.¹⁶⁰ Our analysis only serves to illustrate the rigor that ought to be expected from States.\nFirst, examining the 'size' of the Botnet (the number of Bots) can indicate the potency of its threat and its unique geographical spread,¹⁶¹ which may necessitate international co-operation. Relatedly, determining the locations of foreign devices can enable measures such as notifying users in order to remove malwares from the devices.¹⁶² Second, inquiring the precise activities pursued by the Botnets can indicate the nature of harm they could cause, as described in Significant harms from Botnets. In fact, Botnets are frequently used to earn revenue by illegal activities such as mass spam or theft.¹⁶³ Thus, to meaningfully counter the threat of Botnets in the long-term, it is imperative to cut such streams of revenue that serve as incentives\n¹⁵³ Council of Europe, 'Recommendation CM/Rec (2011)8 of the Committee of Ministers to member states on the protection and promotion of the universality, integrity and openness of the Internet' (21 September 2011) <https: cm=\"\" pages=\"\" result_details.aspx?objectid=\"09000016805cc2f8\" search.coe.int=\"\"> accessed 1st July 2022; Council of Europe, 'Explanatory Memorandum to the draft Recommendation CM/Rec(2011)... of the Committee of Ministers to member states on the protection and promotion of Internet's universality, integrity and openness', (CM Documents, CM(2011)115–add1, 24 August 2011) <https: cm=\"\" pages=\"\" result_details.aspx?objectid=\"09000016805ccaeb\" search.coe.int=\"\"> accessed 1 July 2022 .\n¹⁵⁴ ibid.\n¹⁵⁵ Stockburger (n 104) Control and Capabilities Test: Toward a New Lex Specialis Governing State Responsibility for Third Party Cyber Incidents 259–60.\n¹⁵⁶ Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 90.\n¹⁵⁷ Pulp Mills ; Certain Activities Carried out by Nicaragua in the Border Area (Costa Rica v Nicaragua) and Construction of a Road in Costa Rica along the San Juan River (Nicaragua v Costa Rica) (Merits)  ICJ Rep 200 .\n¹⁵⁸ Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 7 –.\n¹⁵⁹ Boyle (n 101) Developments in the International Law of Environmental Impact Assessments and their Relation to the Espoo Convention 230.\n¹⁶⁰ Mayra Rosario Fuentes and other, 'The Future of P2P IoT Botnets' (Trend Micro, 11 March 2021) <https: 21=\"\" en_in=\"\" ec=\"\" c=\"\" the-future-of-p2p-iot-botnets.html=\"\" research=\"\" www.trendmicro.com=\"\"> accessed 1 July 2022; Ben Dickson, 'IoT botnets might be the cybersecurity industry's next big worry' (IOT Security Foundation, 12 July 2016) <https: 07=\"\" 12=\"\" 2016=\"\" bdtechtalks.com=\"\" iot-botnets-might-be-the-cybersecurity-industrys-next-big-worry=\"\"></https:> accessed 1 July 2022; Shailaja Shankar, 'Ghosts of Botnets Past, Present, and Future' (McAfee, 17 December 2018) <https: blogs=\"\" internet-security=\"\" ghosts-of-botnets-past-present-and-future=\"\" www.mcafee.com=\"\"></https:> accessed 1 July 2022.\n¹⁶¹ Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 26–28.\n¹⁶² BBC (n 73); Zeitlin (n 72) Botnet Takedowns and the Fourth Amendment, 753–754.\n¹⁶³ Ogu and others (n 10) A Botnets Circumspection: The Current Threat Landscape, and What We Know So Far 11–12.</https:></https:></https:>\nREVISITING DUE DILIGENCE IN CYBERSPACE\n337\nfor Botmasters¹⁶⁴—which can only be made possible by this second measure. Third, securing information on the method of propagation of the Botnet and other technicalities such as its malware can assist law enforcement in halting and preventing its spread in the future.¹⁶⁵ Finally, the architecture and communication protocol of the Botnet must be ascertained to understand the appropriate methods to eradicate the Botnet, as also the likely effects of such methods on affected devices.¹⁶⁶ This is of course not to suggest that these factors are to be universally followed, since the extent of diligence expected from States varies with their respective capacities.¹⁶⁷ We turn to this dilemma in the next Sub-Section.\n## Differential capacities for assessment techniques\nOperationalizing the aforementioned factors requires recourse to one or a combination of various methods—categorized as ‘passive’ or ‘active’ techniques.¹⁶⁸ On the facts of each Botnet, one technique might be more strategically appropriate than the other.¹⁶⁹ Passive techniques are relatively stealthier and do not interfere with the Botnets directly,¹⁷⁰ such as analysis of spam records, and anti-virus software feedback;¹⁷¹ though we do not elaborate all such techniques in this article. Active techniques in contrast are relatively more intrusive but offer greater accuracy and reliability in their findings.¹⁷² In construing ‘diligence’, States possessing capacities to deploy either forms of technique may be obligated to determine and utilize the technique most appropriate against a particular Botnet, or at least attempt to do so.\nAn example of active technique is the method of sinkholing—which involves the redirection of Bots from the Botmaster’s malicious domain servers to law enforcement-controlled domain servers.¹⁷³ This technique, which is also characterized as a Domain Name System (DNS) approach, takes for granted that States have a certain amount of technical and financial resources.¹⁷⁴ It also necessitates cooperation with DNS operators, most of whom would be private actors; in the event of their refusal to co-operate, sinkholing can only be pursued if the operators can be legally compelled to that end.¹⁷⁵ Yet that takes for granted the presence of a legal framework that criminalizes cybercriminal acts such as Botnets, enabling the State to compel co-operation. As recently as 2020, it was found in a survey of 194 countries that around 27 countries do not even possess such laws.¹⁷⁶ The situation is worsened in the event that the DNS operator, service provider or corporation is not subject to the State of origin’s enforcement jurisdiction—in which case co-operation with other States would also have to be pursued to proceed.¹⁷⁷ Evidently, toward States of origin presently lacking these necessary capacities, it would be an “undue burden” to expect sophisticated sinkholing techniques. Even in respect of passive techniques such as analyses of spam records, there is a need for certain minimal capacities for\n¹⁶⁴ Ahmad (n 71) Why Botnets Persist: Designing Effective Technical and Policy Interventions 29–31.\n¹⁶⁵ Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 30–31.\n¹⁶⁶ Ogu and others (n 10) A Botnets Circumspection: The Current Threat Landscape, and What We Know So Far 9.\n¹⁶⁷ Supra Sub-section Factors Affecting Standard Of Conduct\n¹⁶⁸ Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 40–78.\n¹⁶⁹ ibid. 40–53, 77–78.\n¹⁷⁰ ibid.\n¹⁷¹ ibid.\n¹⁷² ibid. 53–65, 77–78.\n¹⁷³ ibid. 54–57; Zeitlin (n 72) Botnet Takedowns and the Fourth Amendment 753–754.\n¹⁷⁴ Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 76.\n¹⁷⁵ ibid. 76, 109–110; Asaf Lubin, and João Marinotti, ‘Why Current Botnet Takedown Jurisprudence Should Not Be Replicated’ (Lawfare, 21 Wed 2021) <https: \"bulletproof\"=\"\" 1=\"\" 2022;=\"\" 21=\"\" 2022;=\"\" 2022;=\"\" 21=\"\" 471,=\"\" 471.=\"\" 71.=\"\" <https:=\"\" ag=\"\" alishanda-ransomware-banking-trojans-information-stealers=\"\" blog=\"\" bulletproof-hosting-yalishanda-ransomware-banking-trojans-information-stalers»=\"\" http:=\"\" infel471.com=\"\" international=\"\" international=\"\" infel4711=\"\" blog=\"\" telecommunications=\"\" union,=\"\" www.lawfareblog.com=\"\"> accessed 1 May 2022.\n¹⁷⁶ International Telecommunications Union, Global Cybersecurity Index 2020 Measuring commitment to cybersecurity (ITU Publications 2020) vii.\n¹⁷⁷ Lubin (n 45) The Prohibition on Extraterritorial Enforcement Jurisdiction in the Datasphere.</https:>\nABHIJEET SHRIVASTAVA AND RUDRAKSH LAKRA\nfiltering out malicious content from benign content.¹⁷⁸ Such capacities, in turn, would most likely be uneven across States, especially those within the LDC group.¹⁷⁹\nA related factor is that the pursuit of impact assessment methods as described above often requires high technical know-how, for which past experiences in tackling Botnets are crucial.¹⁸⁰ An accepted indicator of these capabilities is whether a State possesses a National or Sectoral Cyber Incident Response Team (CIRT), which fosters a coordinated cybersecurity ecosystem in the State.¹⁸¹ However, as of 2020, over 63 States did not have National level CIRTs and faced significant barriers in establishing them, given resource deficiencies in institutional knowledge, skills shortages and other factors—especially for LDCs.¹⁸² This strengthens the case¹⁸³ for international co-operation between States and private actors alike in capacity-building and intelligence sharing for improving cybersecurity. In the end, this would benefit not only less capable States, but also the international community at large—as capacity-building would enable the former to better discharge their obligations as States of origin, as we shall argue in The obligation toward cyber capacity building. To reiterate, as the technological capabilities of States advance, the rigour expected in their impact assessments would also increase under due diligence.¹⁸⁴ By the same metric, if Botnet threats advance further beyond a State's renewed capabilities, the State would not be faulted for ineffective impact assessments as long as it invests its best efforts.¹⁸⁵\n## Miscellaneous debates\nBefore proceeding to the next Section on the specific obligations to mitigate and prevent Botnet-related harms, we consider it crucial to outline three unresolved questions as to the scope of the impact assessment obligation. First, some authors have argued for a universal obligation on States to conduct continuous 'monitoring' against cyber threats such as Botnets under due diligence.¹⁸⁶ Seemingly, this connects to the impact assessment stage. In our view, other scholars are correct in responding that general monitoring falls outside its scope,¹⁸⁷ since the obligation is only triggered in the event of a \"preliminary risk\" of harm.¹⁸⁸ Others further argue that this would pose capacity concerns even for developed States, or at least difficulties in making such monitoring conform to human rights safeguards.¹⁸⁹ Yet we further submit that general monitoring\n¹⁷⁸ Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 71–73; Do Le Quoc, André Martin, and Christof Fetzer, 'Scalable and Real-Time Deep Packet Inspection' (IEEE/ACM 6th International Conference on Utility and Cloud Computing, 2013) 446–451.\n¹⁷⁹ Generally, see footnote 191.\n¹⁸⁰ Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 72–74.\n¹⁸¹ ITU (n 176) Global Cybersecurity Index 2020 131–134.\n¹⁸² ibid. 7.\n¹⁸³ Ahmad (n 71) Why Botnets Persist: Designing Effective Technical and Policy Interventions 31–35.\n¹⁸⁴ Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 3 , , , , , ; Coco, and de Souza Dias (n 20) 'Cyber Due Diligence': A Patchwork of Protective Obligations in International Law 787–88; Buchan (n 20) Cyberspace, Non-State Actors and the Obligation to Prevent Transboundary Harm 443; Bannelier-Christakis (n 20) Cyber Diligence: A Low-Intensity Due Diligence Principle for Low-Intensity Cyber Operations? 37.\n¹⁸⁵ ibid.\n¹⁸⁶ O.

The issue, however, is that necessity imposes a stringent test, one that has never been met before the ICJ. In this vein, there could be cases where States of origin fail the obligation to conduct impact assessments for reasons that are legitimate but fall below necessity. The ICJ was asked in Nicaragua v. Costa Rica to find that an \"emergency\" situation could preclude the obligation of holding impact assessments;¹⁹³ however, the Court avoided this legal question by factually finding that there were no circumstances resembling an emergency.¹⁹⁴ This, therefore, remains a question that ought to be debated and clarified by States in their positions on cyber-law or a future treaty on the subject.\nFinally, it is accepted that once a risk of \"significant\" harm is determined, the State of origin must co-operate and consult potentially affected States in good faith.¹⁹⁵ Yet some consider that inter-State co-operation is crucial even during the prior stage of impact assessments.¹⁹⁶ The basis for this assertion is that an accurate examination of the likely harms cannot be facilitated without co-operation from affected States, given their position to directly appreciate the risk posed to their territory¹⁹⁷—here, foreign devices infected by the Botnet. This question too was raised in the case of Nicaragua v. Costa Rica but avoided by the ICJ on grounds of judicial economy.¹⁹⁸ Given the ramifications of this question, we hope to see clearer articulations from States as to their co-operation obligations concerning threats such as Botnets. That said, we now turn to the spectrum of obligations triggered once a risk of significant harm does in fact arise.\n# MITIGATING OR PREVENTING BOTNET-RELATED HARMS\nTo reiterate once again, States of origin must use all means at their disposal to prevent or mitigate harm to target States emanating from the former's territory.¹⁹⁹ This due diligence obligation would arise either upon the State's own impact assessment or by constructive knowledge as\n¹⁹⁰ General monitoring which entails deep packet inspection at scale requires significant computing power.

The mitigating measures the State must take depend on the nature of the harm (including its \"seriousness\" and \"likelihood\"²⁰⁰), the State's capacity, and other circumstances of the case.²⁰¹ The harm in question may result from either the Botnet itself, or through response measures taken by the State of origin against the Botnet. We do not propose that there are specific forms of measures that are universal expectations against any and all Botnets. The purpose of this Section is only to provide an account of contemporary mitigating measures that in our view serve as good practices that depending on the facts, could likely meet the States' due diligence obligations. Like before, we also acknowledge capacity differentials in the discussion.\nWe consider five forms of measures that together could entirely mitigate Botnet-related harms: first, the takeover or takedown of the Botnet, second, the subsequent clean-up of infected devices, third, the fixing of software or hardware vulnerabilities that allowed the Botnet's propagation, fourth, the arrest and prosecution of the Botmaster, and finally, efforts against any financial incentives that may have led to the creation of the Botnets.\nBeginning categorically, the takedown of Botnets involves identifying the gaps in the Botnet's functioning and architecture to thereafter disable or bring it down.²⁰² This measure requires tremendous technical and financial wherewithal as it involves a specialized response to each unique Botnet;²⁰³ it is challenging even for developed States and major private corporations.²⁰⁴ Despite this, it might only provide a fleeting control since the Botmaster would resist takedowns using defence and contingencies.²⁰⁵ Given this, Microsoft's takedowns have failed so often that it has begun instead referring to these attempts as Botnet \"disruptions\".²⁰⁶ To illustrate further, Microsoft botched its attempt to takedown the ZeroAccess Botnet owing to its omission to account for the P2P structure of the Botnet, meaning that the malware on devices was self-executing—and did not respond to a command server.²⁰⁷ Alternatively, Botnets can often have multiple command servers, and the failure to eradicate all such servers has previously enabled their resurgence.²⁰⁸ Clearly, the nature, architecture and protocols of the Botnet could necessitate careful strategies. Thus, it would be absurd to consider Botnet takedowns or takeovers as a universal expectation from even States of origin with high cyber capabilities, let alone developing States and LDCs. There is a need for inter-State and private-State cooperation for collective capacity-building efforts in this regard.\nAs to the second measure, even if a State of origin somehow manages to takedown Botnets—it should attempt to disinfect or clean the malware left on affected devices if the State possesses the necessary capacity. This is because the malware leftovers also pose great risks to the \"stability and behaviour\" of the devices.²⁰⁹ In fact, in the Conflicker Botnet, the leftover malware of the Botnet disabled the security and update mechanisms of five million affected devices.²¹⁰ It is also possible for such leftover malware to join the devices as part of a new Botnet.²¹¹\n200 Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 3 , .\n201 Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 3 , , , ; Coco, and de Souza Dias (n 20) 'Cyber Due Diligence': A Patchwork of Protective Obligations in International Law 787-88.\n202 Ahmad (n 71) Why Botnets Persist: Designing Effective Technical and Policy Interventions, 14.\n203 Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 113\n204 Zeitlin (n 72) Botnet Takedowns and the Fourth Amendment 751-56.\n205 ibid.\n206 Mathew J.

One is to takeover the Botnet's command server to send a notification to users with instructions to uninstall the malware, as the Dutch police demonstrated against the Bredolab Botnet.²¹² Yet this method has several drawbacks. For example, there are often peculiar communication chains in Botnets under which the devices may not promptly receive notifications from the taken-over command server.²¹³ Further, some empirical work shows that users may question the legitimacy of these notifications, given the prevalence of false malware alert scams.²¹⁴ Since control over the command server could be fleeting, giving rise to urgencies, additional measures such as letter or telephonic warnings,²¹⁵ and maintaining a helpdesk such as the German Anti-Botnet initiative²¹⁶ may resolve this concern. However, these measures also require immense technical and financial wherewithal and thus cannot be universal expectations, even if effective.\nA second method to clean-up malware is for law enforcement to unilaterally command the Bots to delete the malware on the infected computers,²¹⁷ akin to the United States approach against the Coreflood Botnet²¹⁸ and Microsoft's against the Citadel Botnets in 2013.²¹⁹ The third method involves unilaterally patching the flaw in the security system of the devices that facilitated the installation of malware to begin with.²²⁰ Apart from being measures that only highly technologically advanced States could be expected to pursue, both these methods carry strong privacy concerns owing to their disregard for user consent.²²¹ This may also allow law enforcement to gain unconsented access to personal data,²²² highlighting the need for human-rights centric legal frameworks regulating Botnet-response measures.²²³ These unilateral measures could also cause unforeseen side effects and should therefore be contemplated cautiously.²²⁴ A State of origin proposing such measures would be bound to conduct prior impact assessments as detailed in Impact assessment obligations around Botnets; as also to co-operate with the potentially affected States. If it undertakes unilateral Botnet takedown or malware clean-up measures that result in significant harm to devices in other States, without having taken appropriate steps to mitigate such harm, it would be in violation of its due diligence obligations.²²⁵\nAs to the remaining common measures, the fixing of software or hardware vulnerabilities that enabled the Botnet's propagation is crucial to improve cybersecurity resilience, such that a similar Botnet does not emerge in the future.²²⁶ The arrest and prosecution of Botmasters would ensure that the same cybercriminals do not rebuild the Botnet once taken down, while\n²¹² BBC (n 73).\n²¹³ Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 110; Ahmad (n 71) Why Botnets Persist: Designing Effective Technical and Policy Interventions 12–13.\n²¹⁴ Wei Meng et and others, 'DNS Changer Remediation Study' (Presentation at the Messaging, Malware, and Mobile Anti-Abuse Working Group 27th General Meeting 7, 19 February 2013) <https: GeorgiaTech_DNSChanger_study-2013-02-19.pdf=\"\" files=\"\" news=\"\" www.m3aawg.org=\"\"> accessed 1 July 2022.\n²¹⁵ Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 111. ibid, page 93.\n²¹⁷ Zeitlin (n 72) 753–54.\n²¹⁸ Brian Krebs, 'FBI Scrubbed 19,000 PCs Snared by Coreflood Botnet' (Krebs On Security, 21 June 2011) <https: attacks-breaches=\"\" microsoft-fails-to-nuke-zeroaccess-botnet=\"\" www.darkreading.com=\"\"> accessed 1 July 2022.\n²¹⁹ In 2013 after sinkholing Citadel botnets used its command infrastructure to update the malware on infected computers.

Yet one commonality across all is the need for international co-operation in their success—cyber capabilities can only flourish best with collective efforts;²²⁹ arrests and prosecutions of transnational cybercriminals can only concretize with mutual legal assistance; and the social evils enabling Botnets eradicated with concerted diplomatic initiatives.²³⁰ It seems then, that due diligence is not only a gap-filling legal arsenal against Botnets amidst the presently mutually suspicious²³¹ State relations in cyberspace; instead, due diligence must also be viewed as a norm that can realize its maximal potential only in a milieu where States develop robust co-operative and consultative efforts. In that vein, it may well become a vehicle for facilitating internationalism in cyberspace, in line with its core logic. This brings us to the final Section of this article, where we detail the overarching obligation of all States toward cyber capacity building, as also the role of international co-operation in its fruition.\n# THE OBLIGATION TOWARD CYBER CAPACITY BUILDING\nAs previously discussed in Factors affecting standard of conduct and The state of origin's knowledge, the obligation of due diligence is a 'duty of conduct'; yet that carries within it an obligation which is a 'duty of result.'²³² This obligation is to build a 'minimum' institutional capacity that would allow States to effectively carry out their due diligence obligations.²³³ This framework should equip the State to be able to detect potential significant harm and to take appropriate mitigating measures to minimize and prevent the harm. This aspect of due diligence has been recognized by the ILC²³⁴ and ICJ.²³⁵ For capacity building, States should make reasonable efforts to create an ability to detect risk, and the capability to mitigate and halt that risk. This obligation of result is necessary for the due diligence norms to have any bite. States including South Korea, Canada, the United Kingdom and Australia in their report on incorporating UNGGE non-binding norms have focused on the building of institutional capacity.²³⁶ These have included raising awareness, creating an appropriate legislative framework, creating or strengthening departments for countering cyber threats, developing incident response plans and domestic policy, and enabling cooperative partnerships—both domestic and international.²³⁷ As with other due diligence obligations, the minimum baseline that is expected of States would differ based\n²²⁷ ibid 121.\n²²⁸ Ahmad (n 71) Why Botnets Persist: Designing Effective Technical and Policy Interventions, 29–31.\n²²⁹ Supra Section on Impact Assessment Obligations Around Botnets\n²³⁰ Fausto Pocar, 'New Challenges for International Rules Against Cyber-Crime' (2004) 10 European Journal on Criminal Policy and Research 27.\n²³¹ Ney and Zimmermann (n 18) Cyber-Security beyond the Military Perspective: International Law, Cyberspace, and the Concept of Due Diligence.\n²³² Coco, and de Souza Dias (n 20) 'Cyber Due Diligence': A Patchwork of Protective Obligations in International Law, 788; Russel Buchan, 'Cyberspace, Non-State Actors and the Obligation to Prevent Transboundary Harm' (2019) 21 Journal of Conflict &amp; Security Law (2016) 429, 434–439.\n²³³ ibid; ILC, Draft Articles on Prevention Article 3 –; Couzigou (n 62) Securing cyber space: the obligation of States to prevent harmful international cyber operations 50–51.\n²³⁴ Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 3 –, Article 5.\n²³⁵ Pulp Mills .\n²³⁶ Andraz Kastelic, \"Due Diligence in Cyberspace: Normative Expectations of Reciprocal Protection of International Legal Rights\" (UNIDIR, 2021) <https: due-diligence-cyberspace-normative-expectations-reciprocal-protection-international=\"\" publication=\"\" www.unidir.org=\"\"> accessed 1 June 2022, 10.\n²³⁷ ibid.</https:>\nREVISITING DUE DILIGENCE IN CYBERSPACE\n343\non their resources and socio-economic factors.²³⁸ Consequently, this baseline would differ for developed states, developing states and LDCs.\nThis Section attempts to provide indicators which States can follow for the process of establishing the capability to detect contemporary Botnets and conduct mitigation efforts. Such indicators would also serve to illustrate the conduct expected from States as technologies and Botnet threats evolve.²³⁹ Further, States are free to design their institutional baseline as long as it is adequate for the harm in question.²⁴⁰ While being mindful of capacity differentials of States, we divide these baseline measures into six categories: national/sectoral cybersecurity strategies, legal measures, measures focusing on preventing Botnet infection, on early detection of botnets, collaborative measures, and review-related measures.\n## National/Sectoral cybersecurity strategies\nStates have limited resources and regulatory capacities. Due diligence recognizes this central pillar of policymaking²⁴¹ and accordingly, it requires states to use their best efforts based on their capabilities.²⁴² To allocate their resources and the regulatory capacity in an economically efficient manner, States should create a strategy for countering threats akin to Botnets based on a risk-based approach, which would help the State identify threats and security gaps that pose a high risk and those that pose a low risk.²⁴³ Based on this level of risk assessment, the State can focus its resources on priority areas where high-risk vulnerabilities exist. This process can be and should ideally be performed both nationally and sectorally.²⁴⁴\nNational cybersecurity strategies should become the cornerstone that guides State measures and initiatives.²⁴⁵ Special focus should be on strengthening and making their networks more resilient to support critical infrastructure, critical supply chains and major financial institutions.²⁴⁶ Such a National Cybersecurity strategy can also be developed based on a multi-stakeholder approach as recommended by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU).²⁴⁷ As regards feasibility, the most States should be able to draw up these strategies as it only requires states to take stock of their resources, their regulatory capacity and the landscape of threats faced by them. Indeed, as of 2020, the ITU found that 127 countries out of 194 countries have now adopted a National Cyber Strategy.²⁴⁸\n## Legal measures\nA suitable legal and regulatory framework is the bedrock of due diligence. As the ILC in their Draft Articles on Transboundary Harm notes, “[s]tates concerned shall take the necessary legislative, administrative or other action…”²⁴⁹. The legal framework should lay out relevant rights\n²³⁸ Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 3 – 17; Coco, and de Souza Dias (n 20) Cyber Due Diligence: A Patchwork of Protective Obligations in International Law 787-88; Buchan (n 20) Cyberspace, Non-State Actors and the Obligation to Prevent Transboundary Harm 443; Bannelier-Christakis (n 20) Cyber Diligence: A Low-Intensity Due Diligence Principle for Low-Intensity Cyber Operations? 37; Couzigou (n 62) Securing cyber space: the obligation of States to prevent harmful international cyber operations 47.\n²³⁹ Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 3 .\n²⁴⁰ Coco, and de Souza Dias (n 20) Cyber Due Diligence: A Patchwork of Protective Obligations in International Law, 787-88.\n²⁴¹ OECD, OECD Regulatory Policy Outlook 2021: Risk-based regulation (OECD Publishing, 2021).\n²⁴² Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 3 , .\n²⁴³ ITU, 'ITU Botnet Mitigation Toolkit' (Jan 2008) ITU Telecommunication Development Sector <https: cyp=\"\" itub-cyb=\"\" cyp/ecybersecurity=\"\" docs=\"\" itu-botnet-mitigation-toolkit-background.pdf=\"\" www.itu.int=\"\"> accessed 1 July 2022, 25; Shackelford, Russell and Kuehn (n 84) Unpacking the International Law on Cybersecurity Due Diligence: Lessons from the Public and Private Sectors 34-42.\n²⁴⁴ Coco, and de Souza Dias (n 30) Cyber due diligence in international law 187-190.\n²⁴⁵ ITU (n 176) Global Cybersecurity Index 2020 145-47; ITU (n 243) Botnet Mitigation Toolkit 25.\n²⁴⁶ ibid.\n²⁴⁷ ibid.\n²⁴⁸ ibid.\n²⁴⁹ Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 5.</https:>\nABHIJEET SHRIVASTAVA AND RUDRAKSH LAKRA\nand responsibilities clearly for State and private parties, and the sanctions and remedies in case of a breach.²⁵⁰ Such a framework would provide foresight to those subject to it and promote deterrence.²⁵¹ In connection to Botnets, any legal framework should attempt to meet two objectives: first, it should clearly criminalize the operation of a Botnet and second, it should provide tools to law enforcement, and other State bodies to effectively investigate and take enforcement actions against Botnets.²⁵² Attempts at facilitating such legal frameworks can take guidance from prevailing international and regional standards.²⁵³\nTurning first to criminalization, the criminalizing law should capture the range of crimes committed by Botnets; these include both ‘core’ cybercrime and ‘cyber-enabled’ crimes. States should ensure that the definition of the crimes adopted by the law should not be such that it succumbs to obsolescence very soon with technological changes.²⁵⁴ A possible approach for this is to define cyber-criminal activities at a high level of abstraction, which would also cover crimes unforeseeable at the time.²⁵⁵ This is in line with the approach in the Budapest Convention.²⁵⁶ Further in line with the Budapest Convention and other such initiatives, it is important to push for creating a uniform and common legislative baseline framework across jurisdictions, so that Botmasters could not exploit any difference in laws in different countries.²⁵⁷ In this regard, there is presently wide disagreement between States about the precise content of crimes beyond core crimes, as presently seen in ongoing debates under the UN’s auspices around a cybercrime treaty.²⁵⁸ This disagreement limits the possibility of harmonization, and thus, one hopes that a representative consensus is reached.\nRegarding the second proposed objective for laws, as Lubin explains, using existing domestic legal remedies such as injunction orders can be inappropriate for Botnet mitigation.²⁵⁹ Thus, the law should provide remedies and procedural tools which accommodate the uniqueness of cyberspace and facilitate suitable resources tailored for Botnet mitigation. The question of which procedural tools law enforcement should have can again be resolved by drawing from international standards.²⁶⁰ There is also a need to build regulatory capacity in a manner that Botnet mitigation operations could be approved at a quicker pace and the body adjudicating these requests is well versed in the specific practical and technical details.²⁶¹ Having a quicker turnaround period is important as Botnets are constantly evolving.²⁶² Consequently, responses against them can quickly become antiquated.\n²⁵⁰ Coco, and de Souza Dias (n 30) Cyber due diligence in international law 171.\n²⁵¹ ibid.\n²⁵² Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 121–22, 125, 127; ITU (n 243) Botnet Mitigation Toolkit 21–31.\n²⁵³ For instance see, Convention on Cybercrime (adopted 23 Nov 2001, entered into force 1 July 2004) 2296 UNTS 167; Arab Convention on Combating Information Technology Offences (adopted 21 December 2010); African Union Convention on Cyber Security and Personal Data Protection (adopted 27 June 2014); UNODC, ‘Second session of the Ad Hoc Committee’ (Second session of the Ad Hoc Committee to Elaborate a Comprehensive International Convention on Countering the Use of Information and Communications Technologies for Criminal Purposes, 2022) <https: ad_hoc_committee=\"\" chc-second-session.html=\"\" en=\"\" www.unodc.org=\"\"> accessed 1 July 2022; ITU (n 243) Botnet Mitigation Toolkit.\n²⁵⁴ Gerard (n 6) Botnet Mitigation and International Law 226.\n²⁵⁵ ibid.\n²⁵⁶ ibid.\n²⁵⁷ Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 25.\n²⁵⁸ Tomaso Falchetta, Deborah Brown and Katitza Rodriguez, ‘Opening Stages in UN Cybercrime Treaty Talks Reflect Human Rights Risks’ (Just Security, 18 April 2022) <https: 81105=\"\" apri=\"\" opening-stages-in-un-cybercrime-treaty-talks-reflect-human-rights-risks=\"\" www.justsecurity.org=\"\"></https:> accessed 30 June 2022.\n²⁵⁹ Lubin, and Marinotti (n 175) Why Current Botnet Takedown Jurisprudence Should Not Be Replicated.\n²⁶⁰ For instance see, Convention on Cybercrime (adopted 23 Nov 2001, entered into force 1 July 2004) 2296 UNTS 167; Arab Convention on Combating Information Technology Offences (adopted 21 Dec 2010); African Union Convention on Cyber Security and Personal Data Protection (adopted 27 June 2014); UNODC, ‘Second session of the Ad Hoc Committee’ (Second session of the Ad Hoc Committee to Elaborate a Comprehensive International Convention on Countering the Use of Information and Communications Technologies for Criminal Purposes, 2022) <https: ad_hoc_committee=\"\" chc-second-session.html=\"\" en=\"\" www.unodc.org=\"\"> accessed 1 July 2022; ITU (n 243) Botnet Mitigation Toolkit.\n²⁶¹ Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 116, 126.\n²⁶² ibid.</https:></https:>\nREVISITING DUE DILIGENCE IN CYBERSPACE\n345\nIt is important to acknowledge that any such legal and regulatory framework should draw a practical balance between enforcement interests and human rights, especially the right to privacy.²⁶³ This is because the principle of due diligence needs to be exercised in compliance with a State's other international legal obligations.²⁶⁴ To elaborate, whenever the right of privacy is implicated, the measure should meet the requirement of legality (accessibility, foresight, independent oversight and data protection safeguards), necessity and proportionality.²⁶⁵ This is linked to our earlier discussion in Mitigating or preventing Botnet-related harms as to how privacy should be taken into account when conducting mitigation measures.\nA final observation is required for the question of the State's capacity to undertake legal and regulatory measures. Some authors have argued that all states are presumably capable of creating such a framework. However, as we highlighted in Factors affecting standard of conduct and Differential capacities for assessment techniques, even creating cybercrime legislation tailored to the threat of Botnet would require financial and technical investments.²⁶⁶ To reiterate, as of 2020, 27 countries out of 194 surveyed by ITU did not have any cybercrime-specific legislations.²⁶⁷ Moreover, even if States had cyber-specific legislations, having an adequate regulatory capacity to enforce it could be particularly challenging for LDCs and certain developing states, as discussed earlier.²⁶⁸\n## Measures for preventing Botnet infections\nPreventive efforts against Botnets can be much more effective than combating Botnet-related threats once the Botnet mushrooms into harmful scales.²⁶⁹ If proactive measures are undertaken to this end, the creation of Botnets, and potentially their potency can be limited if and when States deploy Botnet mitigation measures as described in Mitigating or preventing Botnet-related harms.²⁷⁰ One way to limit the operation and spread of Botnets is to minimize and prevent the infection of devices.²⁷¹ There are primarily two methods through which contemporary Botnets can infect devices—first, by exploiting the vulnerabilities in the software, hardware or firmware used by the devices or second, by social engineering.²⁷²\nThe first method of propagation of malware can be limited first by regulating the suppliers of ICT products in requiring them to follow baseline security measures based on best practices.²⁷³ For this, States such as China, Japan, the United Kingdom, Germany, South Africa and Brazil have focused on technical standards, verification, certification or accreditation schemes.²⁷⁴ Moreover, similar to the harmonization of criminal provisions, there is a need for inter-State dialogue on global baseline security practice.²⁷⁵ This is because Botnets frequently infect devices across a tremendous number of States—for instance, the Mirai botnet infected Botnets in around 85 countries.²⁷⁶ States, particularly LDCs and developing States that do not have the\n²⁶³ ibid. 111.\n²⁶⁴ Coco, and de Souza Dias (n 30) Cyber due diligence in international law 137.\n²⁶⁵ Privacy International, 'Guide to International Law and Surveillance' (Privacy International, Dec 2021) <https: 2021%20gils%20version%203.0_0.pdf=\"\" default=\"\" files=\"\" sites=\"\" www.privacyinternational.org=\"\"> accessed 1 July 2022.\n²⁶⁶ Supra Sub-section on Factors Affecting Standard Of Conduct and Sub-section on Differential Capacities For Assessment Techniques.\n²⁶⁷ ITU (n 176) Global Cybersecurity Index 2020 vii.\n²⁶⁸ Supra Sub-section on Differential Capacities For Assessment Techniques.\n²⁶⁹ Ahmad (n 71) Why Botnets Persist: Designing Effective Technical and Policy Interventions, 26–27; Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 123.\n²⁷⁰ ibid.\n²⁷¹ ibid.\n²⁷² Ahmad (n 71) Why Botnets Persist: Designing Effective Technical and Policy Interventions, 26–27.\n²⁷³ ibid.; Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 123; ITU (n 243) Botnet Mitigation Toolkit.\n²⁷⁴ Coco, and de Souza Dias (n 30) Cyber due diligence in international law 181–186.\n²⁷⁵ ibid.\n²⁷⁶ Ahmad (n 71) Why Botnets Persist: Designing Effective Technical and Policy Interventions, 26–27.</https:>\nABHIJEET SHRIVASTAVA AND RUDRAKSH LAKRA\ncapacity to build their own security standards, can benefit from the best practices publicized by international and regional organizations.²⁷⁷ Further, the vulnerabilities in ICT products can be tackled by carrying out cybersecurity awareness campaigns that focus on end-user awareness to ensure that users keep their software and firmware up to date and install patches.²⁷⁸ Widespread adoption of baseline security practice could make it exacting for Botmasters to infect secured devices and it would limit the proportion of unsecured devices. Infecting secured devices would require more investment, and if it is more than the expected financial return, the financial incentive for Botmasters to create Botnets at all could be curtailed.²⁷⁹\nTurning to the second manner in which Botnets generally propagate—social engineering—it is a method that involves manipulating the end users into committing errors for evading their device security. This is a psychological manipulation technique aiming to manoeuvre users into making security lapses, so as to gain unauthorised access to users' private information, devices, or valuables. However, this method too can be challenged by carrying out cybersecurity awareness campaigns that focus on building tech-literacy, particularly regarding the malware-spreading mechanisms and methods of social engineering.²⁸⁰ These campaigns should focus more on private companies as end-users, given that they have greater financial resources generally than individual end-users, and particularly small and medium enterprises which are more vulnerable.²⁸¹\nA capacity-building measure that would be common as a defense for both methods of Botnet propagation is conducting extensive cybersecurity awareness programs.²⁸² These programs require financial bandwidth to fund campaigns, and technical expertise since trained professionals are needed to spearhead them.²⁸³ Comprehensive public cybersecurity campaigns are arduous for developing and LDC countries. For instance, the ITU Cybersecurity Index revealed that more than half of the countries under examination did not have any cybersecurity educational programs or training for professionals.²⁸⁴ Similarly, a study of cybersecurity awareness for users and executives in Africa found that in the surveyed countries, the lack of such awareness was a major institutional deficiency, necessitating robust programs of this nature.²⁸⁵\n## Measures for early detection\nThe obligation of cyber capacity building toward creating a minimum institutional framework also aims at enabling States to detect threats that pose a risk of significant harm. In the case of Botnets, there is a need to create initiatives that focus on their 'early' detection.²⁸⁶ These can be worked upon by virtue of various mechanisms and initiatives, including some of the presently feasible ones we discuss hereafter.

The CIRTs should engage in information sharing with relevant stakeholders and actors who may have access to information about infections.²⁸⁸ This could include ISP, DNS, anti-virus companies, researchers and private companies facing the primary brunt of cybercrimes.²⁸⁹ However, we reiterate our caution from Differential capacities for assessment techniques in terms of how establishing a CIRT can require significant resources and LDCs particularly face many roadblocks and establishing such frameworks.²⁹⁰ The third mechanism for early detection is based on the cooperation between the State and DNS operators; this is limited to Botnets with command servers that use DNS-based communication protocol.²⁹¹ Here, the focus should be on mitigation efforts. For this, States could create a Botnet-related DNS abuse reputation system that identifies automatically and accurately the malicious domain before they appear on the blacklist.²⁹² However, all of the techniques discussed above would require the cooperation of private entities such as DNS operators and could be demanding for LDCs, especially if some developing States had to compel these private entities if they are non-cooperative, as elaborated in Section on Impact Assessment Obligations Around Botnets.²⁹³ Thus, these techniques may be accepted as good practices, rather than as an obligation for States to meet, especially as they, in any case, serve as illustrations of efforts that could not be alleged as below the due diligence standard.\n## Collaborative measures\nThroughout the article, we have seen how tackling the threat of Botnets requires cooperation and improved communication between relevant stakeholders since they may hold a distinct piece of the puzzle.²⁹⁴ As we have previously noted, Botnets are by their very nature transnational in scope, and due to their scale can often only be taken down by the cooperation not only between multiple States but also private parties which are involved in the takedown, such as antivirus companies, researchers, ISP and DNS providers and other tech companies.²⁹⁵ Impact assessment obligations around Botnets and Mitigating or preventing Botnet-related harms explain how conducting an impact assessment and taking mitigation or prevention measures necessitates a multi-stakeholder approach.²⁹⁶ A concomitant aim should be to build long-term and sustainable collaborations.²⁹⁷ Currently, private actors are not always given their due importance and inter-State cooperation on criminal matters is burdensome and slow as shown by contemporary mutual legal assistance processes.²⁹⁸ Consequently, there is a strong need to create\n²⁸⁷ Ahmad (n 71) Why Botnets Persist: Designing Effective Technical and Policy Interventions 27–29; Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 122.\n²⁸⁸ Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 121.\n²⁸⁹ ibid. 121, 95–102; Ahmad (n 71) Why Botnets Persist: Designing Effective Technical and Policy Interventions, 32–33.\n²⁹⁰ Supra Sub-section on Differential Capacities For Assessment Techniques.\n²⁹¹ Ahmad (n 71) Why Botnets Persist: Designing Effective Technical and Policy Interventions, 27–29.\n²⁹² ibid.; Shuang Hao, Nick Feamster, and Ramakant Pandrangi, 'Monitoring the initial DNS behavior of malicious domains' (IMC '11: Proceedings of the 2011 ACM SIGCOMM conference on Internet measurement conference, November 2011) <https: 2011=\"\" conf2011=\"\" docs=\"\" docx=\"\" p269.pdf=\"\" www.nytimes.com=\"\"> accessed 1 July 2022.\n²⁹³ Supra Sub-section on Differential Capacities For Assessment Techniques.\n²⁹⁴ Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 121–23, 126–28.\n²⁹⁵ For instance, see, David E.

Third, the review should audit the adequacy of its overall cybersecurity infrastructure and efforts.³⁰³ Lastly, as the ITU recommends, the State can require entities both public and private to carry out an periodic cybersecurity audit that examines the information system’s security.³⁰⁴ This can focus on the physical configuration of the systems and software, information handling processes, user practices and environment.³⁰⁵ Again, all these suggestions must be treated as illustrations of good practices crucial for the maximal fruition of States’ due diligence obligations. We do not propose that these exact measures ought to necessarily be pursued as a matter of duty, especially given capacity differentials—however, these presently serve as some of the best possible examples of conduct the diligence of which could not reasonably be doubted. We are, therefore, hopeful for wider adoption of practices of this rigour.\n## CONCLUSION\nThrough this article, we have reaffirmed the increasing confidence in scholarly views for due diligence as a crucial means of regulating transboundary cyber operations. This faith was concretized through a unique legal and policy study of contemporary Botnets, which are among the gravest threats posed in cyberspace. That said, we demonstrated several cautions toward treating due diligence as a panacea against the Pandora’s box of harms opened by the advent of cyberspace, including for Botnets. This included evidentiary dilemmas that target States may face in proving violations of the norm, particularly given the differential standards of conduct expected of States based on their respective capacities—a nuance that we appreciated in relation to the context of the Botnet concerned, as also the State’s capacity against the specific Botnet concerned.\nYet, we also showed that many of these concerns apply to any international legal norm in the face of the novelties of this terrain. Further, due diligence connotes a spectrum of obligations for which target States may pursue the responsibility of a State of origin. This is from the very first stage of demanding that States conduct an impact assessment in the event of a preliminary\n²⁹⁹ Ahmad (n 71) Why Botnets Persist: Designing Effective Technical and Policy Interventions 27–29.\n³⁰⁰ Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 5.\n³⁰¹ Shackelford, Russell and Kuehn (n 84) ‘Unpacking the International Law on Cybersecurity Due Diligence: Lessons from the Public and Private Sectors 41–42.\n³⁰² Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 3 paras .\n³⁰³ Shackelford, Russell and Kuehn (n 84) ‘Unpacking the International Law on Cybersecurity Due Diligence: Lessons from the Public and Private Sectors 41–42; ITU (n 176) Global Cybersecurity Index 2020 146.\n³⁰⁴ ITU (n 176) Global Cybersecurity Index 2020 141.\n³⁰⁵ ibid.\nREVISITING DUE DILIGENCE IN CYBERSPACE\n349\nrisk of harm from Botnets being administered in their jurisdiction (or from the State of origin's response-measures against the Botnets); to the obligation to notify, consult and co-operate with the States potentially affected by the Botnet incident; to the State of origin's obligation to prevent and mitigate transboundary Botnet harm with its best efforts as per its cyber capacity. To that end, we also unpacked the continuous obligation of all States toward cyber capacity building, to facilitate the discharge of their aforesaid obligations against Botnet-related harms. All in all, we submitted that the promise and benefits of due diligence are such as to empower meaningful cyber resilience against Botnets. This is not just until more specific treaties on the subject hopefully take shape—instead, there is merit in supporting the codification and concretization of the norm even in any such future instruments. Indeed, the capacity differentials in due diligence may hold great promise for developing States and LDCs, given its equitable logics.\nIn presenting our claims, we have been conscious of the definitional uncertainties that the articulation of due diligence has carried with respect to the 'Corfu Channel' and 'prevention of harm' principles, including in discourse around cyberspace. Yet we argued for a novel coherent conception of due diligence that unifies these principles, providing States and cybersecurity experts much-needed clarity in understanding the scope of its obligations and trigger-thresholds for complex threats such as Botnets. We also outlined various questions with respect to each specific sub-obligation under due diligence that necessitates urgent dialogue between States. In outlining the standards of conduct expected under due diligence, we exposited scientific literature concerning contemporary Botnets, as also several instances of good practices in this context. We are conscious that those illustrations may become anachronistic as technology advances. The point, however, was largely to demonstrate—unlike thus far seen in cyberspace literature—a concrete methodology and guidelines for States to appreciate the precise rigour of diligence that would be required of them against threats like Botnets. To that extent, it is safe to presume that the relevance of these contentions will remain foregrounded for a long time.\nWhile due diligence is indeed a strong legal device to facilitate international co-operation against Botnets, the opposite is equally true. Considering not least the sheer scale of contemporary transboundary Botnets, the fullest and meaningful actualization of due diligence in cyberspace is only possible with greater international co-operation between States and private actors alike, especially for cyber capacity building. Therefore, there remains an urgent need for robust co-operative and consultative efforts against Botnets and similar threats—which in the end, would only be to the collective benefit of the entire international community at large.\n## ACKNOWLEDGEMENT\nThe authors are grateful to Professor Aman for his guidance during their study of cyberspace, and to Professor Sanskriti Sanghi for her feedback and encouragement."

In existing scholarship, many reasons have informed growing support for the promise of 'due diligence' obligations in regulating transboundary cyber operations. We affirm this position through a study of the specific context of Botnets, although bringing much-needed caution and complexity to the discourse. We offer a comprehensive account of the standard of conduct expected of States in detecting, mitigating and preventing Botnet-linked harms under due diligence; as well as to pursue cyber capacity building toward discharging these obligations. In so doing, we problematize and elaborate on the nature of due diligence as an obligation of conduct, therefore accounting for differential State capacities against Botnet-linked harms. The paper involves attempts to unpack a coherent conception of due diligence, appreciating the spectrum of obligations that it demands, and demonstrating these nuances through an appraisal of good practices adopted by States and private actors against Botnets. Consequently, we provide a unique holistic account of how States and their law enforcement could practically understand the conduct expected of them when faced with transboundary Botnets on a case-to-case basis. In the end, while underscoring potential dilemmas within this legal regime that may be faced by target States, as also its unresolved questions, we submit that due diligence is indeed the most appropriate candidate to act as a legal arsenal against transboundary Botnets.\nKEYWORDS: cyberspace, international law, due diligence, cybersecurity, Botnets.\n# INTRODUCTION The past decades have witnessed unforeseen and unprecedented technological advancements. The advent of information communication technology (ICT) has birthed a new domain in © The Author(s) (2022). Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

In summary, there is no effective special law-governing inter-State conduct against cybercrime. Confusion, therefore, prevails as to the legal obligations of States around Botnets and transboundary cyber operations broadly ² Vasileios Karagiannopoulos, *Living With Hacktivism From Conflict to Symbiosis* (Palgrave Macmillan, 2018) 1–13.\n³ Michael N.

In The relevance of due diligence for cyberspace, we offer a renewed theoretical formulation of due diligence, which is more precise and clearer than existing scholarship. Simultaneously, we consider why this formulation is appropriate for cyberspace and against Botnets. Since due diligence involves “best effort” obligations, we then dive deep into how the standard of conduct expected from each State would vary based on State cyber capacity differentials and the context of the cyber threat. This analysis in Unpacking differential standards of conduct is accompanied by our reflections on the evidentiary dilemmas that States affected by transboundary harm would face in proving breaches of due diligence.\nThereafter, we categorically elaborate the specific obligations demanded by due diligence in relation to Botnets. Triggers for due diligence obligations discuss the trigger points for the majority of due diligence obligations to become applicable. We then discuss obligations concerning the mitigation and prevention of harm that Botnets may cause to other States as well as the role of international cooperation in this regard. In Impact assessment obligations around Botnets, we analyze the obligation to conduct “impact assessments” in case of a preliminary risk of transboundary harm; and in Mitigating or preventing Botnet-related harms, we proceed to mitigation and prevention obligations, while tracing several instances of State and private-led efforts against various Botnets. Finally, we elaborate the obligation of States toward cyber capacity building against Botnet-like threats in The obligation toward cyber capacity building, with extensive discussion of good practices in that context.

Instead, in Reconceiving due diligence, we focus on providing an original and clear theoretical conception of the demands of due diligence. Following this, we briefly discuss in The preference for due diligence the reasons for scholarly confidence in due diligence obligations in the context of cyberspace.\n# Reconceiving due diligence To what end are due diligence obligations designed? Some scholars have differentiated between two allegedly distinct conceptions of due diligence: first, the 'Corfu Channel principle' as emergent from the earliest judgment of the International Court of Justice²⁵ (ICJ); and second, the 'prevention of harm principle'.²⁶ Turning to the first, the ICJ in Corfu Channel held that Albania violated international law by failing to notify British Ships that Albanian territorial waters contained a minefield.²⁷ This was even though Albania itself was not found responsible for laying the said mines.²⁸ The ICJ also held this to be in breach of the obligation\"not to knowingly allow its territory\"to be\"used for acts contrary to the rights of other States\"[emphasis ours].²⁹ Certain authors consider this to mean that due diligence is a 'standard of conduct' which attaches to\"primary\"norms, including in respecting the\"rights\"of other States.³⁰ For example, in Bosnian genocide, the ICJ held that Serbia and Montenegro violated its duty to prevent genocide in Srebrenica, by failing to exercise\"due diligence\"in using all\"all means reasonably at its disposal\".³¹ In this conception, due diligence does not create self-contained obligations, but only serves as a general rubric to measure compliance with other obligations.³² In parallel, the 'prevention of harm' conception, inter alia, requires States to exercise due diligence so as to prevent or minimize\"significant\"transboundary harm to other States—when such harm originates in their territory.³³ This conception also reflects customary international law, as per the ICJ's judgments in Pulp Mills³⁴ and Nicaragua v. Costa Rica,³⁵ which concerned alleged harms to rivers. In this formulation, due diligence does contain self-contained obligations whenever there is a risk of\"significant\"harm.³⁶ Here, 'significance' ²⁴ See generally Heike Krieger, Anne Peters, and Leonhard Kreuzer (eds), Due Diligence in the International Legal Order.\n²⁵ Coco, and de Souza Dias (n 20) Cyber Due Diligence: A Patchwork of Protective Obligations in International Law.\n²⁶ Corfu Channel (United Kingdom v.

Under the other, even otherwise unprohibited activities become unlawful when resulting in “significant harm”. What then, is the law as it stands? In their positions on how international law applies to cyberspace, many States have highlighted the Corfu Channel conception,⁴⁰ while others have supported the prevention of harm conception.⁴¹ Some have instead advanced a singular conception where both the violation of a third State’s rights and “significant harm” need to be conjunctively proven.⁴² This is also the approach of the Tallinn Manual 2.0,⁴³ thus far the most authoritative scholarly text on the law applicable to cyberspace.\nWe regret such inconsistent or incomplete formulations of due diligence by States and scholars alike. We argue that both the Corfu Channel principle and the prevention of harm principle must be construed as part and parcel of a singular due diligence norm. In our conception, due diligence requires the prevention of “significant” transboundary harm. First, when such harm is in violation of any international legal obligation, such as the duty to prevent genocide, the harm must be presumed as significant. However, as we elaborate in *Significant harms from Botnets*, only in the rare event that such an illegal act poses only inconsequential harm, due diligence obligations arguably may not be imposed on States of origin if that would cause an undue burden. Second, in the absence of inherent unlawfulness in the transboundary harm, the significance of the harm can then be examined on a case-to-case basis, using factors that we shall elaborate in Triggers for due diligence obligations. This revised conception has many benefits. One, it coheres two strands of due diligence that have both been recognized by the ICJ.⁴⁴ Two, it gives maximal clarity to States seeking to act diligently, as also to States seeking to allege violations of due diligence. Clarity is crucial for any norm to be operational in cyberspace, which is a terrain carrying its own uncertainties.⁴⁵ We therefore adopt this two-fold conception of due diligence in the following Sections.\n³⁷ Certain Activities Carried out by Nicaragua in the Border Area (Costa Rica v Nicaragua) and Construction of a Road in Costa Rica along the San Juan River (Nicaragua v Costa Rica) (Merits) [2015] ICJ Rep 200 [155].\n³⁸ Coco and de Souza Dias (n 20) ‘Cyber Due Diligence’: A Patchwork of Protective Obligations in International Law, 790.\n³⁹ ibid.\n⁴⁰ Office for Disarmament Affairs, ‘Comments by Member States on the Initial Pre-Draft of the OEWG Report’ (Open-ended Working Group, 2021) <www.un.org disarmament=\"\"open-ended-working-group=\"\"></www.un.org> accessed 1 July 2022 (see individual comments from the Czech Republic and Republic of Korea).\n⁴¹ ‘President of the Republic of Estonia at the opening of CyCon 2019’ (CyCon, 29 May 2019) <https: cjefiles.s3.amazonaws.com=\"\"cgpt=\"\"pdf=\"\"cybernorms=\"\"lawstatements=\"\"remarks+by+the+president+of+the+republic+of+estonia+at+the+opening+of+cycon+2019.pdf=\"\"cech=\"\"cech_rapublic=\"\"> accessed 30 June 2022; Janne Taalas, Ambassador Finland, ‘Statement at the second session of the open-ended Working Group (OEWG) on developments in the field of information and telecommunications in the context of international security’ (Open-ended Working Group, February 2020) <https: 10=\"\"2018=\"\"ccdcoe.org=\"\"cdc0e=\"\"ccdcoe.org.=\"\"online=\"\"opend=\"\"opend,=\"\"ut=\"\"ut.=\"\"ut.2nd-session-of-oewg.pdf=\"\"uploads=\"\"www.cdci.org=\"\"> accessed 1st July 2022; Organization of American States, ‘Improving Transparency — International Law and State Cyber Operations: Fourth Report (Presented by Prof. Duncan B.

First, consider the frequent situations where the Botnet or cyber operation is conducted by private actors. To prove the responsibility of the State where the transboundary harm originates (State of origin), the State affected by such harm (target State) would have to prove that the Botnet's operation is attributable to the State of origin.⁵² The attribution of private actions, such as this Botnet, would only arise if the stringent factual test of\"instruction, direction or control\"is met.⁵³ The test of\"instruction\"has very limited scope, while the joint test of\"direction or control\"requires proof of\"effective control\"over each allegedly wrongful act.⁵⁴ The latter test has never been successful before the ICJ, and rarely before other fora.⁵⁵ A test that is already onerous is further complicated by the immense difficulties States face in collecting digital evidence of attribution in cyberspace, given, for example, novel masking or spoofing technology.⁵⁶ Therefore, proving the violation of other norms, such as the use of force prohibition, is far from feasible⁵⁷—especially for States lacking advanced cyberinfrastructure.\n⁴⁶ Coco and de Souza Dias (n 20) 'Cyber Due Diligence': A Patchwork of Protective Obligations in International Law, 790.\n⁴⁷ Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons (Advisory Opinion) [1996] ICJ Reps 226 [2]; Pulp Mills [101].\n⁴⁸ Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 2 [4], [8].

DUE DILIGENCE IN CYBERSPACE While some authors raise the continuing debates over the thresholds of other primary norms as another reason to prefer due diligence,58 we do not exaggerate this factor—since as we shall show, concretizing due diligence, including the\"significant\"harm threshold also presents difficulties in cyberspace. Still, due diligence can operate in tandem with those primary norms that contain a preventive or positive effort aspect—such as the positive obligation to prevent genocide,59 protect human rights60 and so forth. In this respect, for failing to take measures against Botnets causing specific kinds of harm, the indirect responsibility of States can be alleged—even when the Botnets are not attributable to the State of origin.61 Furthermore, as we elaborate in Unpacking differential standards of conduct, the conduct expected in due diligence is flexible—responding to the factual context as well as the concerned State's own capacities.62 Therefore, in a terrain such as cyberspace and against the threat of Botnets—both of which are constantly and rapidly evolving, due diligence serves the advantage of accommodating advancements in technology,63 as well as imposing an equitable standard of conduct on the States based on their uneven cyber capabilities.64 Moreover, as noted in Introduction, there are presently no treaties meaningfully addressing threats such as Botnets. This is, among other reasons, because States have thus far been unwilling to limit their freedoms in ways that may implicate their own policies; as also their hesitations given the unpredictable growths of technology.[65] Yet even if a treaty does arise in the future, we propose that it ought to codify due diligence as aforementioned to operationalize it in cyberspace. Even if it does not, due diligence obligations would co-exist with the treaty obligations, as has been the case previously,[66] unless the treaty provisions conflict with the custom, such that the lex specialis rule is triggered.[67] Finally, as we argue in The obligation toward cyber capacity building, due diligence also imposes a general duty on States toward cyber capacity building, which would enhance cybersecurity worldwide. This capacity building would enable States to detect and mitigate the harms posed by transboundary Botnets, which we elaborate as their obligation in Mitigating or preventing Botnet-related harms. For all these reasons, as international law stands, due diligence is the most appropriate norm for regulating the international response to cyber operations such as Botnets.\n\nABHIJEET SHRIVASTAVA AND RUDRAKSH LAKRA # UNPACKING DIFFERENTIAL STANDARDS OF CONDUCT This Section contains one of the most important contributions of this article. It considers an in-depth examination of the implications of due diligence being an obligation of best efforts. First, we discuss a variety of factors to be considered when assessing the standard of conduct expected of States of origin based on their cyber capacity. Simultaneously, we elaborate how the factual context around a concerned cyber threat will affect the State of origin's obligations. Second, we consider if this breath of variable factors may evidently impair a target State's case that a State of origin violated its due diligence obligations. This allows a pragmatic appraisal of the obstacles to establishing State responsibility in inter-State litigation.\n# Factors affecting standard of conduct The obligation to prevent and minimize significant transboundary harm is an obligation of 'conduct' and not of 'result.' As hinted earlier, this means that due diligence requires a State of origin only to utilize the means reasonably available to it to meet this expectation, rather than succeeding at preventing or minimizing harm. Thus, the obligations imposed on States of origin are commensurate with their wherewithal—i.e., their cybersecurity capacities comprising financial, technical and institutional resources.\nConsider the question of technical means. The most prevalent forms of Botnets involve a 'command and control' server which sends instructions to Bots from specific web domains.[71] One method of disabling a Botnet is\"sinkholing\"—here, law enforcement takes control of these web domains, and redirects the Bot traffic to severs under their control.[72] When the Dutch police took over the Bredolab Botnet in 2010, it employed this method and used its server to notify all affected users that their devices had been compromised.[73] Could one then assume that whenever a Botnet emerges, with the Botmaster operating the command server in The Netherlands, the Dutch police can be presumed to have the means to sinkhole the Botnet? The answer is in negative.\nFor example, several Botmasters have employed techniques to generate mass false domain names, owing to which locating the command server becomes arduous.[74] In such cases, concerns arise as to collisions with legitimate domains when law enforcement attempts to target malicious domains.[75] In addition, as seen in the Mariposa Botnet takedown by Spanish authorities, not all Botnets use\"static malware\", meaning that Botmasters can often update the code of the malware infecting devices so as to prevent detection of the Botnet itself.[76] This is why despite several apparently successful attempts at taking down the Kelihos Botnet, it continued to\n\nREVISITING DUE DILIGENCE IN CYBERSPACE\n\nWe harp on two points here. First, cybersecurity capacities vary drastically across States.80 The same conduct cannot generally be expected between so-called\"developed\"countries,\"developing\"and\"least developed\"(LDC) countries;81 or even between countries in comparable socio-economic brackets or the same region—given that their cyber capacities against particular threats can differ substantially.82 Second, to reiterate, due diligence requires highly factual assessments.83 Thus, to allege violations of due diligence, target States would have to prove that the concerned State of origin possessed the capacity to detect, mitigate or prevent transboundary Botnet-related harm in relation to the specific Botnet at hand.84 Despite differences of capacity, some authors argue that there are certain measures for which any State should be presumed as capable—by the very virtue of being a State, such as the creation of legislations to penalize cybercrime.85 However, even the creation of regulations and corresponding enforcement agencies requires financial and technical investments.86 Therefore, the contents, scope and effectiveness of such domestic regimes may vary depending on State capacity, without violating due diligence. Therefore, one must be cautious when asserting any supposedly universal expectations under due diligence. At the same time, as State capacity advances, the standard of diligent conduct would also advance commensurably.87 Hence, if a State previously lacking cybercrime police, Botnet detection or mitigation techniques later ABHIJEET SHRIVASTAVA AND RUDRAKSH LAKRA advances to these ends, it would owe target States due diligence obligations thereafter. Yet one is compelled to wonder if the evidentiary burden of a State to prove these variable factors may become self-defeating, negating the promising potential of due diligence in establishing State responsibility.\n## Evidentiary concerns In proving the aforementioned facts, three considerations must be examined separately: the 'burden', 'method' and 'standard' of proof.⁸⁸ The burden of proof concerns whether certain facts must be proven by a particular party—as per the ICJ, the party alleging due diligence violations must prove the necessary facts.⁸⁹ The method of proving facts can either comprise direct or indirect evidence. In Nicaragua v. Costa Rica, the ICJ showed preference for direct scientific evidence, at least on the question of whether the harm alleged over the San Huan river was\"significant\".⁹⁰ Yet in Corfu Channel, the ICJ allowed\"liberal recourse\"to inferences from indirect (circumstantial) evidence proving Albania's knowledge of the placing of mines on its territory.⁹¹ This was because any direct evidence would have been in Albania's exclusive control.⁹² Analogizing, some authors argue that States litigating against cyber operations would face similar evidentiary obstacles, and thus, courts should be amenable to circumstantial digital evidence.⁹³ However, even so, in Corfu Channel, the ICJ only found for the United Kingdom since its set of indirect evidence left\"no room for reasonable doubt\".⁹⁴ This is the 'standard' of proof—i.e., the extent to which the Court must be persuaded as to the existence of facts.⁹⁵ In later cases where the opposing State's direct evidence contradicted the available circumstantial evidence, this standard was not met for the ICJ.⁹⁶ This, in effect means that if States of origin are able to provide direct evidence contradicting the indirect evidence of target States on any count, the latter's case would likely fall. Crucially moreover, in Bosnian Genocide, the Court held that it would apply a higher standard of proof for charges of\"exceptional gravity\"—in that case, concerning the genocide prohibition.⁹⁷ With regard to proving due diligence allegations on factual significant harm in se, the Court has not indicated a precise standard of proof.⁹⁸ Yet at least for cases where applicant States found their submissions on due diligence as a measure of compliance for primary norms, the standards of proof may shift based on the\"gravity\"of the allegations.⁹⁹ Finally, it should be acknowledged that the ICJ in Pulp Mills was asked by Argentina to grant similar flexibilities as in Corfu Channel; although the Court found no need to inquire into the request since it did not consider Argentina evidentially disadvantaged.¹⁰⁰ Moreover, to reiterate, ⁸⁸ Michael P.

While these challenges are certainly formidable, we hesitate to dismiss our preference for due diligence. First, the high standard of proof applied to presentations of circumstantial evidence would affect submissions on any norm violation in cyberspace, not just due diligence.¹⁰³ This would include attempts to attribute private actions to States of origin, the tests for which are in any case extremely stringent.¹⁰⁴ Accordingly and second, due diligence would help avoid impunity by facilitating indirect responsibility at least in certain cases.¹⁰⁵ This is especially for cases where the State of origin manifestly takes none or negligible efforts against the private group¹⁰⁶—i.e., it enabled the Botnet's administration by its unwillingness to act for whatever reason.\nTo reiterate, it could be difficult to prove violations of due diligence expectations that heavily hinge on State capacity (such as Botnet takedowns).¹⁰⁷ Perhaps, even proving the\"risk\"of\"significant\"harm could pose difficulties, as we discuss in Triggers for due diligence obligations. Nevertheless, there would be recourse at least when States of origin attempt unilateral measures against Botnets that could have potential impacts on other States. The target State could argue that a prior\"impact assessment\"should necessarily be held—so as to examine if\"significant\"harm may result from the measure.¹⁰⁸ Indeed, in Nicaragua v. Costa Rica, the ICJ found that Costa Rica violated this procedural requirement, even though it also considered that there was no risk of significant harm at the time.¹⁰⁹ As we elaborate in Impact Assessment Obligations Around Botnets, it is arguable that in conducting such impact assessments, the potentially affected States must be consulted, thus maximizing inter-State cooperation. In any case, when a risk of significant harm is found, the obligation to notify and co-operate with the other States would be triggered.¹¹⁰ Albania's omission to respect this very obligation was what entitled the United Kingdom for full compensation for the damage inflicted on its warships.¹¹¹ Therefore, ¹⁰¹ Alan Boyle, 'Developments in the International Law of Environmental Impact Assessments and their Relation to the Espoo Convention' (2011) 20 Review of European Community &amp; International Environmental Law, 227.\n¹⁰² Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Croatia v.

In any case, the differential standard of conduct it imposes also protects the interests of States for whom higher expectations would have formed an\"undue burden\".¹¹³ Thus, on balance, this regime should remain until and unless distinct opinio juris arises in this regard. This backdrop having been set; we now turn to the spectrum of due diligence obligations specifically applicable to the context of Botnets.\n# TRIGGERS FOR DUE DILIGENCE OBLIGATIONS This Section elaborates two conditions for different obligations under due diligence to apply: first, that the risk of harm should be significant, and second, that the State of origin must possess 'knowledge' of such risk. The first difficulty arises in defining which forms of harms posed by Botnets would be\"significant\".\n# Significant harms from Botnets As regards factual significant harm, the ILC has argued that assessments of harm must be amenable to\"fast evolving technology\".¹¹⁴ While declining to provide clear metrics for measuring\"significance\", it argued that such harm can be somewhere between\"detectable and substantial\"—including harm to persons, property or the environment.¹¹⁵ As we shall elaborate, Botnets may cause tangible or intangible harm, to hardware, software, data and persons.¹¹⁶ A two-fold inquiry may be carried out concerning intrinsic or instrumental harm—for example, the ICJ examined whether the discharge of sediments into the San Huan river could in itself amount to significant harm against Nicaraguan territory, or if it could cause consequences amounting to such harm, such as the extinction of its fish species.¹¹⁷ In examining this, the Court considered the scale, magnitude and context of Costa Rica's road construction project.¹¹⁸ The first acknowledgement then is that not every Botnet is as such harmful—for instance, their use might be for innocuous purposes not amounting to harm, or at a low\"scale\".¹¹⁹ Theoretically, it is possible that despite infecting millions of devices (having a high scale), the Botnet only spreads harmless spam (having little magnitude), or that the devices are clearly secure against the effects the Botnets seeks to cause (in the context of these devices, it does not pose a risk of harm).¹²⁰ Yet it is also possible that despite infecting only a few hundred devices, it may cause ¹¹² ILC Articles on Responsibility of States Articles 31, 34–38.\n¹¹³ Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 3 [3], [17], [12], [13], [11], [16]; Coco and de Souza Dias (n 20) 'Cyber Due Diligence': A Patchwork of Protective Obligations in International Law, 787-88; Buchan (n 20) Cyberspace, Non-State Actors and the Obligation to Prevent Transboundary Harm 443; Bannelier-Christakis (n 20) Cyber Diligence: A Low-Intensity Due Diligence Principle for Low-Intensity Cyber Operations? 37; Couzigou (n 62) Securing cyber space: the obligation of States to prevent harmful international cyber operations 47.\n¹¹⁴ Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 3 [11].\n¹¹⁵ Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 2 [4].\n¹¹⁶ Coco and de Souza Dias (n 20) 'Cyber Due Diligence': A Patchwork of Protective Obligations in International Law 793.\n¹¹⁷ Certain Activities Carried out by Nicaragua in the Border Area (Costa Rica v Nicaragua) and Construction of a Road in Costa Rica along the San Juan River (Nicaragua v Costa Rica) (Merits) [2015] ICJ Rep 200 [155], [192]–[217].\n¹¹⁸ ibid.

The breach of confidentiality could involve the leak, deletion, or threats to interfere with data.¹²⁵ Some authors consider all such intrusions as arbitrary interferences with the primary norm of the right to privacy.¹²⁶ Others argue that States' positive obligation to protect human rights (which would include privacy) is one of due diligence.¹²⁷ Yet others contend, though not without opponents,¹²⁸ that this obligation applies extraterritorially—i.e., a State of origin would owe it to affected device-holders present in the target State.¹²⁹ Reading these views together, could one argue that every Botnet that affects the confidentiality of devices attracts the State of origin's due diligence obligations? While technically arguable, it could impose an undue burden on States given the sheer frequency of\"low-intensity\"cyber operations¹³⁰—and go against the logic that negligible harm is excluded from due diligence.¹³¹ This dilemma, in informal terms, puts due diligence in an awkward position.\nThe analysis would perhaps be clearer depending on the nature of the data, whether it forms part of\"critical\"infrastructure,¹³² the scale of mass data deletion; or to come to\"instrumental\"harms, the concrete effects on human life and property resulting from the Botnet—such as causing financial losses,¹³³ the rigging of ballot machines to distort votes,¹³⁴ manipulating stock markets by using algorithmic trading from the Bots,¹³⁵ spreading hate speech on mass scales to ¹²¹ Kim Zetter, 'An Unprecedented Look at Stuxnet, the World's First Digital Weapon' (Wired, 3 Nov 2014) <https: 11=\"\"2014=\"\"countdown-to-zero-day-stuxnet=\"\"www.wired.com=\"\"></https:> accessed 15 May 2022.\n¹²² David Kushner, 'The Real Story of Stuxnet' (IEE Spectrum, 23 February 2013) <https: spectrum.ieee.org=\"\"the-real-story-of-stuxnet=\"\"the-real-story-of-stuxnet=\"\"></https:> accessed 1 July 2022; Saleh Soltan, Prateek Mittal, and H.

Yet even instrumental effects would require close attention in particular cases. For example, whether mass disinformation campaigns run through Botnets, in the context of pandemics,¹³⁷ elections¹³⁸ or otherwise could be considered “significant” would necessarily depend on the facts and empirics of each case.¹³⁹ Such factors could include the scale of the Botnet, the nature of the disinformation, and the social context at hand.¹⁴⁰ From this long discussion, we conclude the following. First, that a variety of distinct cyber threats posed by Botnets may give rise to risks of significant transboundary harm. Second, at the same time, it is crucial for States to elaborate their views on what forms of cyber threats they consider as such harms, whether intrinsically or instrumentally, given that many cases presently involve ambiguity. Third, in any case, the examination of a risk of significant harm would necessarily be a case-to-case basis test. The same goes for the potential effects of any response measures that States of origin may wish to take against transboundary Botnets, which we elaborate in Mitigating or preventing Botnet-related harms. These complications are why, in Impact assessment obligations around Botnets, we emphasize the need for respecting the obligation¹⁴¹ to conduct an “impact assessment” to examine if significant harm may arise from Botnet response measures that could potentially affect other States.\n# The state of origin's knowledge It is crucial that a great majority of due diligence obligations: that to notify potentially affected States of the risk of significant harm from private or its own activities; and to co-operate with them in order to mitigate, minimize or prevent such harm, all take for granted that the State of origin knows of the existence of this risk.¹⁴² Such knowledge can be either actual or constructive, the latter meaning that in the circumstances of a case, a diligent State ought to or can be presumed to have known of the risk.¹⁴³ As examples, in Corfu Channel, the constant surveillance of Albanian forces close to areas where mines were placed indicated its constructive knowledge as to the presence of the mines;¹⁴⁴ while in Bosnian Genocide, the fact that international bodies and other States continually expressed concerns that genocide may transpire was taken to prove Serbia and Montenegro's constructive knowledge to that effect.¹⁴⁵ Thus, for example, a State of origin's knowledge can be presumed if its own cyber infrastructure was frequently exploited by the private Botnet.¹⁴⁶ Alternatively, as has often been the case,¹⁴⁷ if the target State, other States or private actors publicize the existence of a harmful Botnet, the aforesaid obligations of the State of origin would activate.\n¹³⁶ Coco, and de Souza Dias (n 30) Cyber due diligence in international law 77; HRC, 'Report of the independent international fact-finding mission on Myanmar' (12 September 2018) UN Doc.

Later in Mitigating or preventing Botnet-related harms, we finally address the specific conduct expected of States of States once the trigger thresholds described in Triggers for due diligence obligations are met.\nHowever, before that stage, we begin in this Section by unpacking the earlier stage where there is a preliminary risk of harm to other States—yet it remains uncertain whether the risked harm could be \"significant\". In such situations, we argue that States of origin must conduct impact assessments to examine whether there is a risk of \"significant\" harm from the Botnet or their response measures. First, we outline the contents of the obligation to conduct impact assessments as also an inexhaustive list of factors that these assessments should consider against contemporary Botnets. Second, we discuss impact assessment techniques employed by States thus far and their interplay with differential State capacities. Finally, we elaborate certain miscellaneous questions as to the scope of this obligation that require the urgent attention of States.\n# Setting the law and context\nThe ICJ has recognized that in case of a preliminary risk of harm, States are customarily bound to conduct impact assessments to discover if the concerned harm could be \"significant\".¹⁵⁰ If such a risk becomes apparent, the State of origin must notify and consult the potentially affected States and take measures to mitigate the potential harm.¹⁵¹ Upon discovering suspicious Botnets, a \"preliminary risk\" of this nature must be presupposed given their inherent potential for malicious uses, as described in Significant Harms From Botnets. There is also a frequent affirmation of the need for prior impact assessments in cyberspace.¹⁵² For example, in reference to due diligence, the Council of Europe considers that States must assess if a \"disruption or interference\n¹⁴⁸ Buchan (n 20) Cyberspace, Non-State Actors and the Obligation to Prevent Transboundary Harm 443; Bannelier-Christakis (n 20) Cyber Diligence: A Low-Intensity Due Diligence Principle for Low-Intensity Cyber Operations? 37; Couzigou (n 62) Securing cyber space: the obligation of States to prevent harmful international cyber operations 47.\n¹⁴⁹ O.

Indeed, without proper vigilance, States of origin could inadvertently harm the integrity and functionality of foreign devices, which may even include other States' critical digital infrastructure.¹⁵⁶\nThe ICJ appreciates that States have discretion in deciding the exact modalities of these impact assessments; however, the assessment must account for the \"nature and magnitude\" of the transboundary activity, its likely adverse impact on States, and the need to \"exercise due diligence\" in its conduct.¹⁵⁷ The ILC has taken a similar position, while elaborating that the likely effects on persons, property and environment of the States should be considered,¹⁵⁸ as we described in Significant harms from Botnets. In any event, the assessment should be rooted in \"scientific\" evidence.¹⁵⁹ Based on these legal compulsions and our research on contemporary Botnets, the following are some inexhaustive factors that could inform an effective impact assessment. Needless to add, future Botnets may evolve such that these factors prove inadequate to examine their activities.¹⁶⁰ Our analysis only serves to illustrate the rigor that ought to be expected from States.\nFirst, examining the 'size' of the Botnet (the number of Bots) can indicate the potency of its threat and its unique geographical spread,¹⁶¹ which may necessitate international co-operation. Relatedly, determining the locations of foreign devices can enable measures such as notifying users in order to remove malwares from the devices.¹⁶² Second, inquiring the precise activities pursued by the Botnets can indicate the nature of harm they could cause, as described in Significant harms from Botnets. In fact, Botnets are frequently used to earn revenue by illegal activities such as mass spam or theft.¹⁶³ Thus, to meaningfully counter the threat of Botnets in the long-term, it is imperative to cut such streams of revenue that serve as incentives\n¹⁵³ Council of Europe, 'Recommendation CM/Rec (2011)8 of the Committee of Ministers to member states on the protection and promotion of the universality, integrity and openness of the Internet' (21 September 2011) <https: cm=\"\" pages=\"\" result_details.aspx?objectid=\"09000016805cc2f8\" search.coe.int=\"\"> accessed 1st July 2022; Council of Europe, 'Explanatory Memorandum to the draft Recommendation CM/Rec(2011)... of the Committee of Ministers to member states on the protection and promotion of Internet's universality, integrity and openness', (CM Documents, CM(2011)115–add1, 24 August 2011) <https: cm=\"\" pages=\"\" result_details.aspx?objectid=\"09000016805ccaeb\" search.coe.int=\"\"> accessed 1 July 2022 [79].\n¹⁵⁴ ibid.\n¹⁵⁵ Stockburger (n 104) Control and Capabilities Test: Toward a New Lex Specialis Governing State Responsibility for Third Party Cyber Incidents 259–60.\n¹⁵⁶ Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 90.\n¹⁵⁷ Pulp Mills [205]; Certain Activities Carried out by Nicaragua in the Border Area (Costa Rica v Nicaragua) and Construction of a Road in Costa Rica along the San Juan River (Nicaragua v Costa Rica) (Merits) [2015] ICJ Rep 200 [104].\n¹⁵⁸ Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 7 [7]–[8].\n¹⁵⁹ Boyle (n 101) Developments in the International Law of Environmental Impact Assessments and their Relation to the Espoo Convention 230.\n¹⁶⁰ Mayra Rosario Fuentes and other, 'The Future of P2P IoT Botnets' (Trend Micro, 11 March 2021) <https: 21=\"\" en_in=\"\" ec=\"\" c=\"\" the-future-of-p2p-iot-botnets.html=\"\" research=\"\" www.trendmicro.com=\"\"> accessed 1 July 2022; Ben Dickson, 'IoT botnets might be the cybersecurity industry's next big worry' (IOT Security Foundation, 12 July 2016) <https: 07=\"\" 12=\"\" 2016=\"\" bdtechtalks.com=\"\" iot-botnets-might-be-the-cybersecurity-industrys-next-big-worry=\"\"></https:> accessed 1 July 2022; Shailaja Shankar, 'Ghosts of Botnets Past, Present, and Future' (McAfee, 17 December 2018) <https: blogs=\"\" internet-security=\"\" ghosts-of-botnets-past-present-and-future=\"\" www.mcafee.com=\"\"></https:> accessed 1 July 2022.\n¹⁶¹ Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 26–28.\n¹⁶² BBC (n 73); Zeitlin (n 72) Botnet Takedowns and the Fourth Amendment, 753–754.\n¹⁶³ Ogu and others (n 10) A Botnets Circumspection: The Current Threat Landscape, and What We Know So Far 11–12.</https:></https:></https:>\nREVISITING DUE DILIGENCE IN CYBERSPACE\n\n## Differential capacities for assessment techniques\nOperationalizing the aforementioned factors requires recourse to one or a combination of various methods—categorized as ‘passive’ or ‘active’ techniques.¹⁶⁸ On the facts of each Botnet, one technique might be more strategically appropriate than the other.¹⁶⁹ Passive techniques are relatively stealthier and do not interfere with the Botnets directly,¹⁷⁰ such as analysis of spam records, and anti-virus software feedback;¹⁷¹ though we do not elaborate all such techniques in this article. Active techniques in contrast are relatively more intrusive but offer greater accuracy and reliability in their findings.¹⁷² In construing ‘diligence’, States possessing capacities to deploy either forms of technique may be obligated to determine and utilize the technique most appropriate against a particular Botnet, or at least attempt to do so.\nAn example of active technique is the method of sinkholing—which involves the redirection of Bots from the Botmaster’s malicious domain servers to law enforcement-controlled domain servers.¹⁷³ This technique, which is also characterized as a Domain Name System (DNS) approach, takes for granted that States have a certain amount of technical and financial resources.¹⁷⁴ It also necessitates cooperation with DNS operators, most of whom would be private actors; in the event of their refusal to co-operate, sinkholing can only be pursued if the operators can be legally compelled to that end.¹⁷⁵ Yet that takes for granted the presence of a legal framework that criminalizes cybercriminal acts such as Botnets, enabling the State to compel co-operation. As recently as 2020, it was found in a survey of 194 countries that around 27 countries do not even possess such laws.¹⁷⁶ The situation is worsened in the event that the DNS operator, service provider or corporation is not subject to the State of origin’s enforcement jurisdiction—in which case co-operation with other States would also have to be pursued to proceed.¹⁷⁷ Evidently, toward States of origin presently lacking these necessary capacities, it would be an “undue burden” to expect sophisticated sinkholing techniques.

In the end, this would benefit not only less capable States, but also the international community at large—as capacity-building would enable the former to better discharge their obligations as States of origin, as we shall argue in The obligation toward cyber capacity building. To reiterate, as the technological capabilities of States advance, the rigour expected in their impact assessments would also increase under due diligence.¹⁸⁴ By the same metric, if Botnet threats advance further beyond a State's renewed capabilities, the State would not be faulted for ineffective impact assessments as long as it invests its best efforts.¹⁸⁵\n## Miscellaneous debates\nBefore proceeding to the next Section on the specific obligations to mitigate and prevent Botnet-related harms, we consider it crucial to outline three unresolved questions as to the scope of the impact assessment obligation. First, some authors have argued for a universal obligation on States to conduct continuous 'monitoring' against cyber threats such as Botnets under due diligence.¹⁸⁶ Seemingly, this connects to the impact assessment stage. In our view, other scholars are correct in responding that general monitoring falls outside its scope,¹⁸⁷ since the obligation is only triggered in the event of a \"preliminary risk\" of harm.¹⁸⁸ Others further argue that this would pose capacity concerns even for developed States, or at least difficulties in making such monitoring conform to human rights safeguards.¹⁸⁹ Yet we further submit that general monitoring\n¹⁷⁸ Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 71–73; Do Le Quoc, André Martin, and Christof Fetzer, 'Scalable and Real-Time Deep Packet Inspection' (IEEE/ACM 6th International Conference on Utility and Cloud Computing, 2013) 446–451.\n¹⁷⁹ Generally, see footnote 191.\n¹⁸⁰ Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 72–74.\n¹⁸¹ ITU (n 176) Global Cybersecurity Index 2020 131–134.\n¹⁸² ibid. 7.\n¹⁸³ Ahmad (n 71) Why Botnets Persist: Designing Effective Technical and Policy Interventions 31–35.\n¹⁸⁴ Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 3 [3], [17], [12], [13], [11], [16]; Coco, and de Souza Dias (n 20) 'Cyber Due Diligence': A Patchwork of Protective Obligations in International Law 787–88; Buchan (n 20) Cyberspace, Non-State Actors and the Obligation to Prevent Transboundary Harm 443; Bannelier-Christakis (n 20) Cyber Diligence: A Low-Intensity Due Diligence Principle for Low-Intensity Cyber Operations? 37.\n¹⁸⁵ ibid.\n¹⁸⁶ O.

The issue, however, is that necessity imposes a stringent test, one that has never been met before the ICJ. In this vein, there could be cases where States of origin fail the obligation to conduct impact assessments for reasons that are legitimate but fall below necessity. The ICJ was asked in Nicaragua v. Costa Rica to find that an\"emergency\"situation could preclude the obligation of holding impact assessments;¹⁹³ however, the Court avoided this legal question by factually finding that there were no circumstances resembling an emergency.¹⁹⁴ This, therefore, remains a question that ought to be debated and clarified by States in their positions on cyber-law or a future treaty on the subject.\nFinally, it is accepted that once a risk of\"significant\"harm is determined, the State of origin must co-operate and consult potentially affected States in good faith.¹⁹⁵ Yet some consider that inter-State co-operation is crucial even during the prior stage of impact assessments.¹⁹⁶ The basis for this assertion is that an accurate examination of the likely harms cannot be facilitated without co-operation from affected States, given their position to directly appreciate the risk posed to their territory¹⁹⁷—here, foreign devices infected by the Botnet. This question too was raised in the case of Nicaragua v. Costa Rica but avoided by the ICJ on grounds of judicial economy.¹⁹⁸ Given the ramifications of this question, we hope to see clearer articulations from States as to their co-operation obligations concerning threats such as Botnets. That said, we now turn to the spectrum of obligations triggered once a risk of significant harm does in fact arise.\n# MITIGATING OR PREVENTING BOTNET-RELATED HARMS To reiterate once again, States of origin must use all means at their disposal to prevent or mitigate harm to target States emanating from the former's territory.¹⁹⁹ This due diligence obligation would arise either upon the State's own impact assessment or by constructive knowledge as ¹⁹⁰ General monitoring which entails deep packet inspection at scale requires significant computing power.

The mitigating measures the State must take depend on the nature of the harm (including its\"seriousness\"and\"likelihood\"²⁰⁰), the State's capacity, and other circumstances of the case.²⁰¹ The harm in question may result from either the Botnet itself, or through response measures taken by the State of origin against the Botnet. We do not propose that there are specific forms of measures that are universal expectations against any and all Botnets. The purpose of this Section is only to provide an account of contemporary mitigating measures that in our view serve as good practices that depending on the facts, could likely meet the States' due diligence obligations. Like before, we also acknowledge capacity differentials in the discussion.\nWe consider five forms of measures that together could entirely mitigate Botnet-related harms: first, the takeover or takedown of the Botnet, second, the subsequent clean-up of infected devices, third, the fixing of software or hardware vulnerabilities that allowed the Botnet's propagation, fourth, the arrest and prosecution of the Botmaster, and finally, efforts against any financial incentives that may have led to the creation of the Botnets.\nBeginning categorically, the takedown of Botnets involves identifying the gaps in the Botnet's functioning and architecture to thereafter disable or bring it down.²⁰² This measure requires tremendous technical and financial wherewithal as it involves a specialized response to each unique Botnet;²⁰³ it is challenging even for developed States and major private corporations.²⁰⁴ Despite this, it might only provide a fleeting control since the Botmaster would resist takedowns using defence and contingencies.²⁰⁵ Given this, Microsoft's takedowns have failed so often that it has begun instead referring to these attempts as Botnet\"disruptions\".²⁰⁶ To illustrate further, Microsoft botched its attempt to takedown the ZeroAccess Botnet owing to its omission to account for the P2P structure of the Botnet, meaning that the malware on devices was self-executing—and did not respond to a command server.²⁰⁷ Alternatively, Botnets can often have multiple command servers, and the failure to eradicate all such servers has previously enabled their resurgence.²⁰⁸ Clearly, the nature, architecture and protocols of the Botnet could necessitate careful strategies. Thus, it would be absurd to consider Botnet takedowns or takeovers as a universal expectation from even States of origin with high cyber capabilities, let alone developing States and LDCs. There is a need for inter-State and private-State cooperation for collective capacity-building efforts in this regard.\nAs to the second measure, even if a State of origin somehow manages to takedown Botnets—it should attempt to disinfect or clean the malware left on affected devices if the State possesses the necessary capacity. This is because the malware leftovers also pose great risks to the\"stability and behaviour\"of the devices.²⁰⁹ In fact, in the Conflicker Botnet, the leftover malware of the Botnet disabled the security and update mechanisms of five million affected devices.²¹⁰ It is also possible for such leftover malware to join the devices as part of a new Botnet.²¹¹\n\nREVISITING DUE DILIGENCE IN CYBERSPACE\n\nA second method to clean-up malware is for law enforcement to unilaterally command the Bots to delete the malware on the infected computers,²¹⁷ akin to the United States approach against the Coreflood Botnet²¹⁸ and Microsoft's against the Citadel Botnets in 2013.²¹⁹ The third method involves unilaterally patching the flaw in the security system of the devices that facilitated the installation of malware to begin with.²²⁰ Apart from being measures that only highly technologically advanced States could be expected to pursue, both these methods carry strong privacy concerns owing to their disregard for user consent.²²¹ This may also allow law enforcement to gain unconsented access to personal data,²²² highlighting the need for human-rights centric legal frameworks regulating Botnet-response measures.²²³ These unilateral measures could also cause unforeseen side effects and should therefore be contemplated cautiously.²²⁴ A State of origin proposing such measures would be bound to conduct prior impact assessments as detailed in Impact assessment obligations around Botnets; as also to co-operate with the potentially affected States. If it undertakes unilateral Botnet takedown or malware clean-up measures that result in significant harm to devices in other States, without having taken appropriate steps to mitigate such harm, it would be in violation of its due diligence obligations.²²⁵ As to the remaining common measures, the fixing of software or hardware vulnerabilities that enabled the Botnet's propagation is crucial to improve cybersecurity resilience, such that a similar Botnet does not emerge in the future.²²⁶ The arrest and prosecution of Botmasters would ensure that the same cybercriminals do not rebuild the Botnet once taken down, while ²¹² BBC (n 73).\n²¹³ Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 110; Ahmad (n 71) Why Botnets Persist: Designing Effective Technical and Policy Interventions 12–13.\n²¹⁴ Wei Meng et and others, 'DNS Changer Remediation Study' (Presentation at the Messaging, Malware, and Mobile Anti-Abuse Working Group 27th General Meeting 7, 19 February 2013) <https: GeorgiaTech_DNSChanger_study-2013-02-19.pdf=\"\"files=\"\"news=\"\"www.m3aawg.org=\"\"> accessed 1 July 2022.\n²¹⁵ Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 111. ibid, page 93.\n²¹⁷ Zeitlin (n 72) 753–54.\n²¹⁸ Brian Krebs, 'FBI Scrubbed 19,000 PCs Snared by Coreflood Botnet' (Krebs On Security, 21 June 2011) <https: attacks-breaches=\"\"microsoft-fails-to-nuke-zeroaccess-botnet=\"\"www.darkreading.com=\"\"> accessed 1 July 2022.\n²¹⁹ In 2013 after sinkholing Citadel botnets used its command infrastructure to update the malware on infected computers.

Yet one commonality across all is the need for international co-operation in their success—cyber capabilities can only flourish best with collective efforts;²²⁹ arrests and prosecutions of transnational cybercriminals can only concretize with mutual legal assistance; and the social evils enabling Botnets eradicated with concerted diplomatic initiatives.²³⁰ It seems then, that due diligence is not only a gap-filling legal arsenal against Botnets amidst the presently mutually suspicious²³¹ State relations in cyberspace; instead, due diligence must also be viewed as a norm that can realize its maximal potential only in a milieu where States develop robust co-operative and consultative efforts. In that vein, it may well become a vehicle for facilitating internationalism in cyberspace, in line with its core logic. This brings us to the final Section of this article, where we detail the overarching obligation of all States toward cyber capacity building, as also the role of international co-operation in its fruition.\n# THE OBLIGATION TOWARD CYBER CAPACITY BUILDING As previously discussed in Factors affecting standard of conduct and The state of origin's knowledge, the obligation of due diligence is a 'duty of conduct'; yet that carries within it an obligation which is a 'duty of result.'²³² This obligation is to build a 'minimum' institutional capacity that would allow States to effectively carry out their due diligence obligations.²³³ This framework should equip the State to be able to detect potential significant harm and to take appropriate mitigating measures to minimize and prevent the harm. This aspect of due diligence has been recognized by the ILC²³⁴ and ICJ.²³⁵ For capacity building, States should make reasonable efforts to create an ability to detect risk, and the capability to mitigate and halt that risk. This obligation of result is necessary for the due diligence norms to have any bite. States including South Korea, Canada, the United Kingdom and Australia in their report on incorporating UNGGE non-binding norms have focused on the building of institutional capacity.²³⁶ These have included raising awareness, creating an appropriate legislative framework, creating or strengthening departments for countering cyber threats, developing incident response plans and domestic policy, and enabling cooperative partnerships—both domestic and international.²³⁷ As with other due diligence obligations, the minimum baseline that is expected of States would differ based ²²⁷ ibid 121.\n²²⁸ Ahmad (n 71) Why Botnets Persist: Designing Effective Technical and Policy Interventions, 29–31.\n²²⁹ Supra Section on Impact Assessment Obligations Around Botnets ²³⁰ Fausto Pocar, 'New Challenges for International Rules Against Cyber-Crime' (2004) 10 European Journal on Criminal Policy and Research 27.\n²³¹ Ney and Zimmermann (n 18) Cyber-Security beyond the Military Perspective: International Law, Cyberspace, and the Concept of Due Diligence.\n²³² Coco, and de Souza Dias (n 20) 'Cyber Due Diligence': A Patchwork of Protective Obligations in International Law, 788; Russel Buchan, 'Cyberspace, Non-State Actors and the Obligation to Prevent Transboundary Harm' (2019) 21 Journal of Conflict &amp; Security Law (2016) 429, 434–439.\n²³³ ibid; ILC, Draft Articles on Prevention Article 3 [15]–[17]; Couzigou (n 62) Securing cyber space: the obligation of States to prevent harmful international cyber operations 50–51.\n²³⁴ Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 3 [14]–[17], Article 5.\n²³⁵ Pulp Mills [197].\n²³⁶ Andraz Kastelic,\"Due Diligence in Cyberspace: Normative Expectations of Reciprocal Protection of International Legal Rights\"<https: due-diligence-cyberspace-normative-expectations-reciprocal-protection-international=\"\"publication=\"\"www.unidir.org=\"\"> accessed 1 June 2022, 10.\n²³⁷ ibid.</https:> REVISITING DUE DILIGENCE IN CYBERSPACE This Section attempts to provide indicators which States can follow for the process of establishing the capability to detect contemporary Botnets and conduct mitigation efforts. Such indicators would also serve to illustrate the conduct expected from States as technologies and Botnet threats evolve.²³⁹ Further, States are free to design their institutional baseline as long as it is adequate for the harm in question.²⁴⁰ While being mindful of capacity differentials of States, we divide these baseline measures into six categories: national/sectoral cybersecurity strategies, legal measures, measures focusing on preventing Botnet infection, on early detection of botnets, collaborative measures, and review-related measures.\n## National/Sectoral cybersecurity strategies States have limited resources and regulatory capacities. Due diligence recognizes this central pillar of policymaking²⁴¹ and accordingly, it requires states to use their best efforts based on their capabilities.²⁴² To allocate their resources and the regulatory capacity in an economically efficient manner, States should create a strategy for countering threats akin to Botnets based on a risk-based approach, which would help the State identify threats and security gaps that pose a high risk and those that pose a low risk.²⁴³ Based on this level of risk assessment, the State can focus its resources on priority areas where high-risk vulnerabilities exist. This process can be and should ideally be performed both nationally and sectorally.²⁴⁴ National cybersecurity strategies should become the cornerstone that guides State measures and initiatives.²⁴⁵ Special focus should be on strengthening and making their networks more resilient to support critical infrastructure, critical supply chains and major financial institutions.²⁴⁶ Such a National Cybersecurity strategy can also be developed based on a multi-stakeholder approach as recommended by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU).²⁴⁷ As regards feasibility, the most States should be able to draw up these strategies as it only requires states to take stock of their resources, their regulatory capacity and the landscape of threats faced by them. Indeed, as of 2020, the ITU found that 127 countries out of 194 countries have now adopted a National Cyber Strategy.²⁴⁸ ## Legal measures A suitable legal and regulatory framework is the bedrock of due diligence. As the ILC in their Draft Articles on Transboundary Harm notes, “[s]tates concerned shall take the necessary legislative, administrative or other action…”²⁴⁹. The legal framework should lay out relevant rights ²³⁸ Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 3 [12]–[13] 17; Coco, and de Souza Dias (n 20) Cyber Due Diligence: A Patchwork of Protective Obligations in International Law 787-88; Buchan (n 20) Cyberspace, Non-State Actors and the Obligation to Prevent Transboundary Harm 443; Bannelier-Christakis (n 20) Cyber Diligence: A Low-Intensity Due Diligence Principle for Low-Intensity Cyber Operations? 37; Couzigou (n 62) Securing cyber space: the obligation of States to prevent harmful international cyber operations 47.\n²³⁹ Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 3 [11].\n²⁴⁰ Coco, and de Souza Dias (n 20) Cyber Due Diligence: A Patchwork of Protective Obligations in International Law, 787-88.\n²⁴¹ OECD, OECD Regulatory Policy Outlook 2021: Risk-based regulation (OECD Publishing, 2021).\n²⁴² Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 3 [3], [5].\n²⁴³ ITU, 'ITU Botnet Mitigation Toolkit' ITU Telecommunication Development Sector <https: cyp=\"\"itub-cyb=\"\"cyp/ecybersecurity=\"\"docs=\"\"itu-botnet-mitigation-toolkit-background.pdf=\"\"www.itu.int=\"\"> accessed 1 July 2022, 25; Shackelford, Russell and Kuehn (n 84) Unpacking the International Law on Cybersecurity Due Diligence: Lessons from the Public and Private Sectors 34-42.\n²⁴⁴ Coco, and de Souza Dias (n 30) Cyber due diligence in international law 187-190.\n²⁴⁵ ITU (n 176) Global Cybersecurity Index 2020 145-47; ITU (n 243) Botnet Mitigation Toolkit 25.\n²⁴⁶ ibid.\n²⁴⁷ ibid.\n²⁴⁸ ibid.\n²⁴⁹ Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 5.</https:> ABHIJEET SHRIVASTAVA AND RUDRAKSH LAKRA and responsibilities clearly for State and private parties, and the sanctions and remedies in case of a breach.²⁵⁰ Such a framework would provide foresight to those subject to it and promote deterrence.²⁵¹ In connection to Botnets, any legal framework should attempt to meet two objectives: first, it should clearly criminalize the operation of a Botnet and second, it should provide tools to law enforcement, and other State bodies to effectively investigate and take enforcement actions against Botnets.²⁵² Attempts at facilitating such legal frameworks can take guidance from prevailing international and regional standards.²⁵³ Turning first to criminalization, the criminalizing law should capture the range of crimes committed by Botnets; these include both ‘core’ cybercrime and ‘cyber-enabled’ crimes. States should ensure that the definition of the crimes adopted by the law should not be such that it succumbs to obsolescence very soon with technological changes.²⁵⁴ A possible approach for this is to define cyber-criminal activities at a high level of abstraction, which would also cover crimes unforeseeable at the time.²⁵⁵ This is in line with the approach in the Budapest Convention.²⁵⁶ Further in line with the Budapest Convention and other such initiatives, it is important to push for creating a uniform and common legislative baseline framework across jurisdictions, so that Botmasters could not exploit any difference in laws in different countries.²⁵⁷ In this regard, there is presently wide disagreement between States about the precise content of crimes beyond core crimes, as presently seen in ongoing debates under the UN’s auspices around a cybercrime treaty.²⁵⁸ This disagreement limits the possibility of harmonization, and thus, one hopes that a representative consensus is reached.\nRegarding the second proposed objective for laws, as Lubin explains, using existing domestic legal remedies such as injunction orders can be inappropriate for Botnet mitigation.²⁵⁹ Thus, the law should provide remedies and procedural tools which accommodate the uniqueness of cyberspace and facilitate suitable resources tailored for Botnet mitigation. The question of which procedural tools law enforcement should have can again be resolved by drawing from international standards.²⁶⁰ There is also a need to build regulatory capacity in a manner that Botnet mitigation operations could be approved at a quicker pace and the body adjudicating these requests is well versed in the specific practical and technical details.²⁶¹ Having a quicker turnaround period is important as Botnets are constantly evolving.²⁶² Consequently, responses against them can quickly become antiquated.\n²⁵⁰ Coco, and de Souza Dias (n 30) Cyber due diligence in international law 171.\n²⁵¹ ibid.\n²⁵² Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 121–22, 125, 127; ITU (n 243) Botnet Mitigation Toolkit 21–31.\n²⁵³ For instance see, Convention on Cybercrime (adopted 23 Nov 2001, entered into force 1 July 2004) 2296 UNTS 167; Arab Convention on Combating Information Technology Offences (adopted 21 December 2010); African Union Convention on Cyber Security and Personal Data Protection (adopted 27 June 2014); UNODC, ‘Second session of the Ad Hoc Committee’ (Second session of the Ad Hoc Committee to Elaborate a Comprehensive International Convention on Countering the Use of Information and Communications Technologies for Criminal Purposes, 2022) <https: ad_hoc_committee=\"\"chc-second-session.html=\"\"en=\"\"www.unodc.org=\"\"> accessed 1 July 2022; ITU (n 243) Botnet Mitigation Toolkit.\n²⁵⁴ Gerard (n 6) Botnet Mitigation and International Law 226.\n²⁵⁵ ibid.\n²⁵⁶ ibid.\n²⁵⁷ Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 25.\n²⁵⁸ Tomaso Falchetta, Deborah Brown and Katitza Rodriguez, ‘Opening Stages in UN Cybercrime Treaty Talks Reflect Human Rights Risks’ (Just Security, 18 April 2022) <https: 81105=\"\"apri=\"\"opening-stages-in-un-cybercrime-treaty-talks-reflect-human-rights-risks=\"\"www.justsecurity.org=\"\"></https:> accessed 30 June 2022.\n²⁵⁹ Lubin, and Marinotti (n 175) Why Current Botnet Takedown Jurisprudence Should Not Be Replicated.\n²⁶⁰ For instance see, Convention on Cybercrime (adopted 23 Nov 2001, entered into force 1 July 2004) 2296 UNTS 167; Arab Convention on Combating Information Technology Offences (adopted 21 Dec 2010); African Union Convention on Cyber Security and Personal Data Protection (adopted 27 June 2014); UNODC, ‘Second session of the Ad Hoc Committee’ (Second session of the Ad Hoc Committee to Elaborate a Comprehensive International Convention on Countering the Use of Information and Communications Technologies for Criminal Purposes, 2022) <https: ad_hoc_committee=\"\"chc-second-session.html=\"\"en=\"\"www.unodc.org=\"\"> accessed 1 July 2022; ITU (n 243) Botnet Mitigation Toolkit.\n²⁶¹ Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 116, 126.\n²⁶² ibid.</https:></https:> REVISITING DUE DILIGENCE IN CYBERSPACE A final observation is required for the question of the State's capacity to undertake legal and regulatory measures. Some authors have argued that all states are presumably capable of creating such a framework. However, as we highlighted in Factors affecting standard of conduct and Differential capacities for assessment techniques, even creating cybercrime legislation tailored to the threat of Botnet would require financial and technical investments.²⁶⁶ To reiterate, as of 2020, 27 countries out of 194 surveyed by ITU did not have any cybercrime-specific legislations.²⁶⁷ Moreover, even if States had cyber-specific legislations, having an adequate regulatory capacity to enforce it could be particularly challenging for LDCs and certain developing states, as discussed earlier.²⁶⁸ ## Measures for preventing Botnet infections Preventive efforts against Botnets can be much more effective than combating Botnet-related threats once the Botnet mushrooms into harmful scales.²⁶⁹ If proactive measures are undertaken to this end, the creation of Botnets, and potentially their potency can be limited if and when States deploy Botnet mitigation measures as described in Mitigating or preventing Botnet-related harms.²⁷⁰ One way to limit the operation and spread of Botnets is to minimize and prevent the infection of devices.²⁷¹ There are primarily two methods through which contemporary Botnets can infect devices—first, by exploiting the vulnerabilities in the software, hardware or firmware used by the devices or second, by social engineering.²⁷² The first method of propagation of malware can be limited first by regulating the suppliers of ICT products in requiring them to follow baseline security measures based on best practices.²⁷³ For this, States such as China, Japan, the United Kingdom, Germany, South Africa and Brazil have focused on technical standards, verification, certification or accreditation schemes.²⁷⁴ Moreover, similar to the harmonization of criminal provisions, there is a need for inter-State dialogue on global baseline security practice.²⁷⁵ This is because Botnets frequently infect devices across a tremendous number of States—for instance, the Mirai botnet infected Botnets in around 85 countries.²⁷⁶ States, particularly LDCs and developing States that do not have the ²⁶³ ibid. 111.\n²⁶⁴ Coco, and de Souza Dias (n 30) Cyber due diligence in international law 137.\n²⁶⁵ Privacy International, 'Guide to International Law and Surveillance' (Privacy International, Dec 2021) <https: 2021%20gils%20version%203.0_0.pdf=\"\"default=\"\"files=\"\"sites=\"\"www.privacyinternational.org=\"\"> accessed 1 July 2022.\n²⁶⁶ Supra Sub-section on Factors Affecting Standard Of Conduct and Sub-section on Differential Capacities For Assessment Techniques.\n²⁶⁷ ITU (n 176) Global Cybersecurity Index 2020 vii.\n²⁶⁸ Supra Sub-section on Differential Capacities For Assessment Techniques.\n²⁶⁹ Ahmad (n 71) Why Botnets Persist: Designing Effective Technical and Policy Interventions, 26–27; Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 123.\n²⁷⁰ ibid.\n²⁷¹ ibid.\n²⁷² Ahmad (n 71) Why Botnets Persist: Designing Effective Technical and Policy Interventions, 26–27.\n²⁷³ ibid.; Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 123; ITU (n 243) Botnet Mitigation Toolkit.\n²⁷⁴ Coco, and de Souza Dias (n 30) Cyber due diligence in international law 181–186.\n²⁷⁵ ibid.\n²⁷⁶ Ahmad (n 71) Why Botnets Persist: Designing Effective Technical and Policy Interventions, 26–27.</https:> ABHIJEET SHRIVASTAVA AND RUDRAKSH LAKRA capacity to build their own security standards, can benefit from the best practices publicized by international and regional organizations.²⁷⁷ Further, the vulnerabilities in ICT products can be tackled by carrying out cybersecurity awareness campaigns that focus on end-user awareness to ensure that users keep their software and firmware up to date and install patches.²⁷⁸ Widespread adoption of baseline security practice could make it exacting for Botmasters to infect secured devices and it would limit the proportion of unsecured devices. Infecting secured devices would require more investment, and if it is more than the expected financial return, the financial incentive for Botmasters to create Botnets at all could be curtailed.²⁷⁹ Turning to the second manner in which Botnets generally propagate—social engineering—it is a method that involves manipulating the end users into committing errors for evading their device security. This is a psychological manipulation technique aiming to manoeuvre users into making security lapses, so as to gain unauthorised access to users' private information, devices, or valuables. However, this method too can be challenged by carrying out cybersecurity awareness campaigns that focus on building tech-literacy, particularly regarding the malware-spreading mechanisms and methods of social engineering.²⁸⁰ These campaigns should focus more on private companies as end-users, given that they have greater financial resources generally than individual end-users, and particularly small and medium enterprises which are more vulnerable.²⁸¹ A capacity-building measure that would be common as a defense for both methods of Botnet propagation is conducting extensive cybersecurity awareness programs.²⁸² These programs require financial bandwidth to fund campaigns, and technical expertise since trained professionals are needed to spearhead them.²⁸³ Comprehensive public cybersecurity campaigns are arduous for developing and LDC countries. For instance, the ITU Cybersecurity Index revealed that more than half of the countries under examination did not have any cybersecurity educational programs or training for professionals.²⁸⁴ Similarly, a study of cybersecurity awareness for users and executives in Africa found that in the surveyed countries, the lack of such awareness was a major institutional deficiency, necessitating robust programs of this nature.²⁸⁵ ## Measures for early detection The obligation of cyber capacity building toward creating a minimum institutional framework also aims at enabling States to detect threats that pose a risk of significant harm. In the case of Botnets, there is a need to create initiatives that focus on their 'early' detection.²⁸⁶ These can be worked upon by virtue of various mechanisms and initiatives, including some of the presently feasible ones we discuss hereafter.

Third, the review should audit the adequacy of its overall cybersecurity infrastructure and efforts.³⁰³ Lastly, as the ITU recommends, the State can require entities both public and private to carry out an periodic cybersecurity audit that examines the information system’s security.³⁰⁴ This can focus on the physical configuration of the systems and software, information handling processes, user practices and environment.³⁰⁵ Again, all these suggestions must be treated as illustrations of good practices crucial for the maximal fruition of States’ due diligence obligations. We do not propose that these exact measures ought to necessarily be pursued as a matter of duty, especially given capacity differentials—however, these presently serve as some of the best possible examples of conduct the diligence of which could not reasonably be doubted. We are, therefore, hopeful for wider adoption of practices of this rigour.\n## CONCLUSION\nThrough this article, we have reaffirmed the increasing confidence in scholarly views for due diligence as a crucial means of regulating transboundary cyber operations. This faith was concretized through a unique legal and policy study of contemporary Botnets, which are among the gravest threats posed in cyberspace. That said, we demonstrated several cautions toward treating due diligence as a panacea against the Pandora’s box of harms opened by the advent of cyberspace, including for Botnets. This included evidentiary dilemmas that target States may face in proving violations of the norm, particularly given the differential standards of conduct expected of States based on their respective capacities—a nuance that we appreciated in relation to the context of the Botnet concerned, as also the State’s capacity against the specific Botnet concerned.\nYet, we also showed that many of these concerns apply to any international legal norm in the face of the novelties of this terrain. Further, due diligence connotes a spectrum of obligations for which target States may pursue the responsibility of a State of origin. This is from the very first stage of demanding that States conduct an impact assessment in the event of a preliminary\n²⁹⁹ Ahmad (n 71) Why Botnets Persist: Designing Effective Technical and Policy Interventions 27–29.\n³⁰⁰ Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 5.\n³⁰¹ Shackelford, Russell and Kuehn (n 84) ‘Unpacking the International Law on Cybersecurity Due Diligence: Lessons from the Public and Private Sectors 41–42.\n³⁰² Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 3 paras [11].\n³⁰³ Shackelford, Russell and Kuehn (n 84) ‘Unpacking the International Law on Cybersecurity Due Diligence: Lessons from the Public and Private Sectors 41–42; ITU (n 176) Global Cybersecurity Index 2020 146.\n³⁰⁴ ITU (n 176) Global Cybersecurity Index 2020 141.\n³⁰⁵ ibid.\nREVISITING DUE DILIGENCE IN CYBERSPACE\n\nIn presenting our claims, we have been conscious of the definitional uncertainties that the articulation of due diligence has carried with respect to the 'Corfu Channel' and 'prevention of harm' principles, including in discourse around cyberspace. Yet we argued for a novel coherent conception of due diligence that unifies these principles, providing States and cybersecurity experts much-needed clarity in understanding the scope of its obligations and trigger-thresholds for complex threats such as Botnets. We also outlined various questions with respect to each specific sub-obligation under due diligence that necessitates urgent dialogue between States. In outlining the standards of conduct expected under due diligence, we exposited scientific literature concerning contemporary Botnets, as also several instances of good practices in this context. We are conscious that those illustrations may become anachronistic as technology advances. The point, however, was largely to demonstrate—unlike thus far seen in cyberspace literature—a concrete methodology and guidelines for States to appreciate the precise rigour of diligence that would be required of them against threats like Botnets. To that extent, it is safe to presume that the relevance of these contentions will remain foregrounded for a long time.\nWhile due diligence is indeed a strong legal device to facilitate international co-operation against Botnets, the opposite is equally true. Considering not least the sheer scale of contemporary transboundary Botnets, the fullest and meaningful actualization of due diligence in cyberspace is only possible with greater international co-operation between States and private actors alike, especially for cyber capacity building. Therefore, there remains an urgent need for robust co-operative and consultative efforts against Botnets and similar threats—which in the end, would only be to the collective benefit of the entire international community at large.\n## ACKNOWLEDGEMENT The authors are grateful to Professor Aman for his guidance during their study of cyberspace, and to Professor Sanskriti Sanghi for her feedback and encouragement."

The advent of information communication technology (ICT) has birthed a new domain in\n© The Author(s) (2022). Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

In summary, there is no effective special law-governing inter-State conduct against cybercrime. Confusion, therefore, prevails as to the legal obligations of States around Botnets and transboundary cyber operations broadly\n² Vasileios Karagiannopoulos, *Living With Hacktivism From Conflict to Symbiosis* (Palgrave Macmillan, 2018) 1–13.\n³ Michael N.

In The relevance of due diligence for cyberspace, we offer a renewed theoretical formulation of due diligence, which is more precise and clearer than existing scholarship. Simultaneously, we consider why this formulation is appropriate for cyberspace and against Botnets. Since due diligence involves “best effort” obligations, we then dive deep into how the standard of conduct expected from each State would vary based on State cyber capacity differentials and the context of the cyber threat. This analysis in Unpacking differential standards of conduct is accompanied by our reflections on the evidentiary dilemmas that States affected by transboundary harm would face in proving breaches of due diligence.\nThereafter, we categorically elaborate the specific obligations demanded by due diligence in relation to Botnets. Triggers for due diligence obligations discuss the trigger points for the majority of due diligence obligations to become applicable. We then discuss obligations concerning the mitigation and prevention of harm that Botnets may cause to other States as well as the role of international cooperation in this regard. In Impact assessment obligations around Botnets, we analyze the obligation to conduct “impact assessments” in case of a preliminary risk of transboundary harm; and in Mitigating or preventing Botnet-related harms, we proceed to mitigation and prevention obligations, while tracing several instances of State and private-led efforts against various Botnets. Finally, we elaborate the obligation of States toward cyber capacity building against Botnet-like threats in The obligation toward cyber capacity building, with extensive discussion of good practices in that context.

This included evidentiary dilemmas that target States may face in proving violations of the norm, particularly given the differential standards of conduct expected of States based on their respective capacities—a nuance that we appreciated in relation to the context of the Botnet concerned, as also the State’s capacity against the specific Botnet concerned.\nYet, we also showed that many of these concerns apply to any international legal norm in the face of the novelties of this terrain. Further, due diligence connotes a spectrum of obligations for which target States may pursue the responsibility of a State of origin. This is from the very first stage of demanding that States conduct an impact assessment in the event of a preliminary\n²⁹⁹ Ahmad (n 71) Why Botnets Persist: Designing Effective Technical and Policy Interventions 27–29.\n³⁰⁰ Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 5.\n³⁰¹ Shackelford, Russell and Kuehn (n 84) ‘Unpacking the International Law on Cybersecurity Due Diligence: Lessons from the Public and Private Sectors 41–42.\n³⁰² Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 3 paras .\n³⁰³ Shackelford, Russell and Kuehn (n 84) ‘Unpacking the International Law on Cybersecurity Due Diligence: Lessons from the Public and Private Sectors 41–42; ITU (n 176) Global Cybersecurity Index 2020 146.\n³⁰⁴ ITU (n 176) Global Cybersecurity Index 2020 141.\n³⁰⁵ ibid.\nREVISITING DUE DILIGENCE IN CYBERSPACE\n349\nrisk of harm from Botnets being administered in their jurisdiction (or from the State of origin's response-measures against the Botnets); to the obligation to notify, consult and co-operate with the States potentially affected by the Botnet incident; to the State of origin's obligation to prevent and mitigate transboundary Botnet harm with its best efforts as per its cyber capacity. To that end, we also unpacked the continuous obligation of all States toward cyber capacity building, to facilitate the discharge of their aforesaid obligations against Botnet-related harms. All in all, we submitted that the promise and benefits of due diligence are such as to empower meaningful cyber resilience against Botnets. This is not just until more specific treaties on the subject hopefully take shape—instead, there is merit in supporting the codification and concretization of the norm even in any such future instruments. Indeed, the capacity differentials in due diligence may hold great promise for developing States and LDCs, given its equitable logics.\nIn presenting our claims, we have been conscious of the definitional uncertainties that the articulation of due diligence has carried with respect to the 'Corfu Channel' and 'prevention of harm' principles, including in discourse around cyberspace. Yet we argued for a novel coherent conception of due diligence that unifies these principles, providing States and cybersecurity experts much-needed clarity in understanding the scope of its obligations and trigger-thresholds for complex threats such as Botnets. We also outlined various questions with respect to each specific sub-obligation under due diligence that necessitates urgent dialogue between States. In outlining the standards of conduct expected under due diligence, we exposited scientific literature concerning contemporary Botnets, as also several instances of good practices in this context. We are conscious that those illustrations may become anachronistic as technology advances. The point, however, was largely to demonstrate—unlike thus far seen in cyberspace literature—a concrete methodology and guidelines for States to appreciate the precise rigour of diligence that would be required of them against threats like Botnets. To that extent, it is safe to presume that the relevance of these contentions will remain foregrounded for a long time.\nWhile due diligence is indeed a strong legal device to facilitate international co-operation against Botnets, the opposite is equally true. Considering not least the sheer scale of contemporary transboundary Botnets, the fullest and meaningful actualization of due diligence in cyberspace is only possible with greater international co-operation between States and private actors alike, especially for cyber capacity building. Therefore, there remains an urgent need for robust co-operative and consultative efforts against Botnets and similar threats—which in the end, would only be to the collective benefit of the entire international community at large.",

In existing scholarship, many reasons have informed growing support for the promise of 'due diligence' obligations in regulating transboundary cyber operations. We affirm this position through a study of the specific context of Botnets, although bringing much-needed caution and complexity to the discourse. We offer a comprehensive account of the standard of conduct expected of States in detecting, mitigating and preventing Botnet-linked harms under due diligence; as well as to pursue cyber capacity building toward discharging these obligations. In so doing, we problematize and elaborate on the nature of due diligence as an obligation of conduct, therefore accounting for differential State capacities against Botnet-linked harms. The paper involves attempts to unpack a coherent conception of due diligence, appreciating the spectrum of obligations that it demands, and demonstrating these nuances through an appraisal of good practices adopted by States and private actors against Botnets. Consequently, we provide a unique holistic account of how States and their law enforcement could practically understand the conduct expected of them when faced with transboundary Botnets on a case-to-case basis. In the end, while underscoring potential dilemmas within this legal regime that may be faced by target States, as also its unresolved questions, we submit that due diligence is indeed the most appropriate candidate to act as a legal arsenal against transboundary Botnets.\n\nKEYWORDS: cyberspace, international law, due diligence, cybersecurity, Botnets.\n\n# INTRODUCTION\n\nThe past decades have witnessed unforeseen and unprecedented technological advancements.

In summary, there is no effective special law-governing inter-State conduct against cybercrime.

    "REVISITING DUE DILIGENCE IN CYBERSPACE\n323\n\nspeaking.¹⁸ This presents one of the greatest challenges to international law, given not only the increasing number of Botnets; but also, the increasing unilateral action by State actors and private vigilantes against Botnets—which could affect the interests of several other States at once.¹⁹\n\nIn this context, many scholars have reposed faith in the customary obligation of States to exercise due diligence to prevent transboundary harm to other States (due diligence).²⁰ This is a “best efforts” obligation, which would require States to prevent or minimize harm to other States from Botnets that are being administered under their jurisdiction.²¹ It would equally cover the cyber responses of States or private actors in their jurisdiction against such Botnets with transboundary effects.²² In this article, we affirm this position, albeit while problematizing the unconditional optimism²³ that most authors have shown for due diligence. In The relevance of due diligence for cyberspace, we offer a renewed theoretical formulation of due diligence, which is more precise and clearer than existing scholarship. Simultaneously, we consider why this formulation is appropriate for cyberspace and against Botnets. Since due diligence involves “best effort” obligations, we then dive deep into how the standard of conduct expected from each State would vary based on State cyber capacity differentials and the context of the cyber threat. This analysis in Unpacking differential standards of conduct is accompanied by our reflections on the evidentiary dilemmas that States affected by transboundary harm would face in proving breaches of due diligence.\n\nThereafter, we categorically elaborate the specific obligations demanded by due diligence in relation to Botnets. Triggers for due diligence obligations discuss the trigger points for the majority of due diligence obligations to become applicable. We then discuss obligations concerning the mitigation and prevention of harm that Botnets may cause to other States as well as the role of international cooperation in this regard. In Impact assessment obligations around Botnets, we analyze the obligation to conduct “impact assessments” in case of a preliminary risk of transboundary harm; and in Mitigating or preventing Botnet-related harms, we proceed to mitigation and prevention obligations, while tracing several instances of State and private-led efforts against various Botnets. Finally, we elaborate the obligation of States toward cyber capacity building against Botnet-like threats in The obligation toward cyber capacity building, with extensive discussion of good practices in that context.

Instead, in Reconceiving due diligence, we focus on providing an original and clear theoretical conception of the demands of due diligence. Following this, we briefly discuss in The preference for due diligence the reasons for scholarly confidence in due diligence obligations in the context of cyberspace.\n\n# Reconceiving due diligence\n\nTo what end are due diligence obligations designed? Some scholars have differentiated between two allegedly distinct conceptions of due diligence: first, the 'Corfu Channel principle' as emergent from the earliest judgment of the International Court of Justice²⁵ (ICJ); and second, the 'prevention of harm principle'.²⁶ Turning to the first, the ICJ in Corfu Channel held that Albania violated international law by failing to notify British Ships that Albanian territorial waters contained a minefield.²⁷ This was even though Albania itself was not found responsible for laying the said mines.²⁸ The ICJ also held this to be in breach of the obligation \"not to knowingly allow its territory\" to be \"used for acts contrary to the rights of other States\" [emphasis ours].²⁹ Certain authors consider this to mean that due diligence is a 'standard of conduct' which attaches to \"primary\" norms, including in respecting the \"rights\" of other States.³⁰ For example, in Bosnian genocide, the ICJ held that Serbia and Montenegro violated its duty to prevent genocide in Srebrenica, by failing to exercise \"due diligence\" in using all \"all means reasonably at its disposal\".³¹ In this conception, due diligence does not create self-contained obligations, but only serves as a general rubric to measure compliance with other obligations.³²\n\nIn parallel, the 'prevention of harm' conception, inter alia, requires States to exercise due diligence so as to prevent or minimize \"significant\" transboundary harm to other States—when such harm originates in their territory.³³ This conception also reflects customary international law, as per the ICJ's judgments in Pulp Mills³⁴ and Nicaragua v. Costa Rica,³⁵ which concerned alleged harms to rivers. In this formulation, due diligence does contain self-contained obligations whenever there is a risk of \"significant\" harm.³⁶ Here, 'significance'\n\n²⁴ See generally Heike Krieger, Anne Peters, and Leonhard Kreuzer (eds), Due Diligence in the International Legal Order (OUP, 2020).\n²⁵ Coco, and de Souza Dias (n 20) Cyber Due Diligence: A Patchwork of Protective Obligations in International Law.\n²⁶ Corfu Channel (United Kingdom v.

    "REVISITING DUE DILIGENCE IN CYBERSPACE\n335\n\ndepends on the scale, context, and magnitude of the harm.³⁷ Scholars argue that this does not require the violation of any primary norm or the recognized rights of other States.³⁸ Rather, the existence of such a risk in se triggers due diligence obligations on a case-to-case basis.³⁹\n\nIn other words, transboundary activities in the ‘Corfu Channel’ conception require the transboundary activities to be unlawful as such. Under the other, even otherwise unprohibited activities become unlawful when resulting in “significant harm”. What then, is the law as it stands? In their positions on how international law applies to cyberspace, many States have highlighted the Corfu Channel conception,⁴⁰ while others have supported the prevention of harm conception.⁴¹ Some have instead advanced a singular conception where both the violation of a third State’s rights and “significant harm” need to be conjunctively proven.⁴² This is also the approach of the Tallinn Manual 2.0,⁴³ thus far the most authoritative scholarly text on the law applicable to cyberspace.\n\nWe regret such inconsistent or incomplete formulations of due diligence by States and scholars alike. We argue that both the Corfu Channel principle and the prevention of harm principle must be construed as part and parcel of a singular due diligence norm. In our conception, due diligence requires the prevention of “significant” transboundary harm. First, when such harm is in violation of any international legal obligation, such as the duty to prevent genocide, the harm must be presumed as significant. However, as we elaborate in *Significant harms from Botnets*, only in the rare event that such an illegal act poses only inconsequential harm, due diligence obligations arguably may not be imposed on States of origin if that would cause an undue burden. Second, in the absence of inherent unlawfulness in the transboundary harm, the significance of the harm can then be examined on a case-to-case basis, using factors that we shall elaborate in Triggers for due diligence obligations. This revised conception has many benefits. One, it coheres two strands of due diligence that have both been recognized by the ICJ.⁴⁴ Two, it gives maximal clarity to States seeking to act diligently, as also to States seeking to allege violations of due diligence. Clarity is crucial for any norm to be operational in cyberspace, which is a terrain carrying its own uncertainties.⁴⁵ We therefore adopt this two-fold conception of due diligence in the following Sections.\n\n³⁷ Certain Activities Carried out by Nicaragua in the Border Area (Costa Rica v Nicaragua) and Construction of a Road in Costa Rica along the San Juan River (Nicaragua v Costa Rica) (Merits) [2015] ICJ Rep 200 [155].\n³⁸ Coco and de Souza Dias (n 20) ‘Cyber Due Diligence’: A Patchwork of Protective Obligations in International Law, 790.\n³⁹ ibid.\n⁴⁰ Office for Disarmament Affairs, ‘Comments by Member States on the Initial Pre-Draft of the OEWG Report’ (Open-ended Working Group, 2021) <www.un.org disarmament=\"\" open-ended-working-group=\"\"></www.un.org> accessed 1 July 2022 (see individual comments from the Czech Republic and Republic of Korea).\n⁴¹ ‘President of the Republic of Estonia at the opening of CyCon 2019’ (CyCon, 29 May 2019) <https: cjefiles.s3.amazonaws.com=\"\" cgpt=\"\" pdf=\"\" cybernorms=\"\" lawstatements=\"\" remarks+by+the+president+of+the+republic+of+estonia+at+the+opening+of+cycon+2019.pdf=\"\" cech=\"\" cech_rapublic=\"\"> accessed 30 June 2022; Janne Taalas, Ambassador Finland, ‘Statement at the second session of the open-ended Working Group (OEWG) on developments in the field of information and telecommunications in the context of international security’ (Open-ended Working Group, February 2020) <https: 10=\"\" 2018=\"\" ccdcoe.org=\"\" cdc0e=\"\" ccdcoe.org.=\"\" online=\"\" opend=\"\" opend,=\"\" ut=\"\" ut.=\"\" ut.2nd-session-of-oewg.pdf=\"\" uploads=\"\" www.cdci.org=\"\"> accessed 1st July 2022; Organization of American States, ‘Improving Transparency — International Law and State Cyber Operations: Fourth Report (Presented by Prof. Duncan B.

    "ABHIJEET SHRIVASTAVA AND RUDRAKSH LAKRA\n\n# The preference for due diligence\n\nWhile some have argued that due diligence applies only in the context of international environmental law,⁴⁶ its general coverage finds support in the views of the ICJ,⁴⁷ the International Law Commission (ILC),⁴⁸ and the positions of most States that have discussed how international law applies to cyberspace.⁴⁹ We also take for granted in this article the assertion that all existing international law norms apply to cyberspace, in the absence of new opinio juris to the contrary.⁵⁰ Indeed, this is now the majority view in both scholarship and the recent positions of States.⁵¹ The question then naturally arises as to why for addressing harmful cyber operations, including Botnets, in particular, we choose to focus on due diligence when the entire spectrum of international law remains open.\n\nSeveral reasons justify this choice. First, consider the frequent situations where the Botnet or cyber operation is conducted by private actors. To prove the responsibility of the State where the transboundary harm originates (State of origin), the State affected by such harm (target State) would have to prove that the Botnet's operation is attributable to the State of origin.⁵² The attribution of private actions, such as this Botnet, would only arise if the stringent factual test of \"instruction, direction or control\" is met.⁵³ The test of \"instruction\" has very limited scope, while the joint test of \"direction or control\" requires proof of \"effective control\" over each allegedly wrongful act.⁵⁴ The latter test has never been successful before the ICJ, and rarely before other fora.⁵⁵ A test that is already onerous is further complicated by the immense difficulties States face in collecting digital evidence of attribution in cyberspace, given, for example, novel masking or spoofing technology.⁵⁶ Therefore, proving the violation of other norms, such as the use of force prohibition, is far from feasible⁵⁷—especially for States lacking advanced cyberinfrastructure.\n\n⁴⁶ Coco and de Souza Dias (n 20) 'Cyber Due Diligence': A Patchwork of Protective Obligations in International Law, 790.\n⁴⁷ Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons (Advisory Opinion) [1996] ICJ Reps 226 [2]; Pulp Mills [101].\n⁴⁸ Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 2 [4], [8].

    "REVISITING DUE DILIGENCE IN CYBERSPACE\n\nWhile some authors raise the continuing debates over the thresholds of other primary norms as another reason to prefer due diligence,58 we do not exaggerate this factor—since as we shall show, concretizing due diligence, including the \"significant\" harm threshold also presents difficulties in cyberspace. Still, due diligence can operate in tandem with those primary norms that contain a preventive or positive effort aspect—such as the positive obligation to prevent genocide,59 protect human rights60 and so forth. In this respect, for failing to take measures against Botnets causing specific kinds of harm, the indirect responsibility of States can be alleged—even when the Botnets are not attributable to the State of origin.61 Furthermore, as we elaborate in Unpacking differential standards of conduct, the conduct expected in due diligence is flexible—responding to the factual context as well as the concerned State's own capacities.62 Therefore, in a terrain such as cyberspace and against the threat of Botnets—both of which are constantly and rapidly evolving, due diligence serves the advantage of accommodating advancements in technology,63 as well as imposing an equitable standard of conduct on the States based on their uneven cyber capabilities.64\n\nMoreover, as noted in Introduction, there are presently no treaties meaningfully addressing threats such as Botnets. This is, among other reasons, because States have thus far been unwilling to limit their freedoms in ways that may implicate their own policies; as also their hesitations given the unpredictable growths of technology.[65] Yet even if a treaty does arise in the future, we propose that it ought to codify due diligence as aforementioned to operationalize it in cyberspace. Even if it does not, due diligence obligations would co-exist with the treaty obligations, as has been the case previously,[66] unless the treaty provisions conflict with the custom, such that the lex specialis rule is triggered.[67] Finally, as we argue in The obligation toward cyber capacity building, due diligence also imposes a general duty on States toward cyber capacity building, which would enhance cybersecurity worldwide. This capacity building would enable States to detect and mitigate the harms posed by transboundary Botnets, which we elaborate as their obligation in Mitigating or preventing Botnet-related harms. For all these reasons, as international law stands, due diligence is the most appropriate norm for regulating the international response to cyber operations such as Botnets.\n\n58 Barrie Sander, 'Democracy Under The Influence: Paradigms of State Responsibility for Cyber Influence Operations on Elections' (2019) 18 Chinese Journal of International Law 1, 18-24, 52; Rebecca Crootof, 'International Cyberorts: Expanding State Accountability in Cyberspace' (2018) 103 Cornell Law Review 565.\n59 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (adopted 12 January 1951, entered into force 12 January 1951) 78 UNTS 277 Article 1; Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v Serbia and Montenegro) (Merits) [2007] ICJ Rep (2007) 43 [430]-[431].\n60 Koivurova (n 30) Due Diligence, [45].\n61 Schmitt (n 20) In Defense of Due Diligence in Cyberspace.\n62 Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm article 3 [3], [17], [12], [13], [11], [18]; Coco and de Souza Dias (n 20) 'Cyber Due Diligence': A Patchwork of Protective Obligations in International Law 787-88; Buchan (n 20) Cyberspace, Non-State Actors and the Obligation to Prevent Transboundary Harm 443; Bannelier-Christakis (n 20) Cyber Diligence: A Low-Intensity Due Diligence Principle for Low-Intensity Cyber Operations? 37; Iréne Couzigou, 'Securing cyber space: the obligation of States to prevent harmful international cyber operations' (2018) 32 International Review of Law, Computers &amp; Technology 37, 47.\n63 Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm article 3 [11].\n64 Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm article 3 [3], [17], [12], [13], [11], [16]; Coco and de Souza Dias (n 20) 'Cyber Due Diligence': A Patchwork of Protective Obligations in International Law 787-88; Buchan (n 20) Cyberspace, Non-State Actors and the Obligation to Prevent Transboundary Harm, 443; Bannelier-Christakis (n 20) Cyber Diligence: A Low-Intensity Due Diligence Principle for Low-Intensity Cyber Operations? 37; Couzigou (n 62) Securing cyber space: the obligation of States to prevent harmful international cyber operations 47.\n65 Ney and Zimmermann (n 18) Cyber-Security beyond the Military Perspective: International Law, Cyberspace, and the Concept of Due Diligence.\n6 Certain Activities Carried out by Nicaragua in the Border Area (Costa Rica v Nicaragua) and Construction of a Road in Costa Rica along the San Juan River (Nicaragua v Costa Rica) (Merits) [2015] ICJ Rep 200 [107].\n67 Akande, Coco and de Souza Dias (n 50) Old Habits Die Hard: Applying Existing International Law in Cyberspace and Beyond; ILC, 'Fragmentation of International Law: Difficulties Arising from the Diversification and Expansion of International Law' (13 April 2006) Report of the Study Group of the International Law Commission Finalized by Martti Koskenniemi, UN Doc A/CN.4/L.682, [120].",
    "ABHIJEET SHRIVASTAVA AND RUDRAKSH LAKRA\n\n# UNPACKING DIFFERENTIAL STANDARDS OF CONDUCT\n\nThis Section contains one of the most important contributions of this article. It considers an in-depth examination of the implications of due diligence being an obligation of best efforts. First, we discuss a variety of factors to be considered when assessing the standard of conduct expected of States of origin based on their cyber capacity. Simultaneously, we elaborate how the factual context around a concerned cyber threat will affect the State of origin's obligations. Second, we consider if this breath of variable factors may evidently impair a target State's case that a State of origin violated its due diligence obligations. This allows a pragmatic appraisal of the obstacles to establishing State responsibility in inter-State litigation.\n\n# Factors affecting standard of conduct\n\nThe obligation to prevent and minimize significant transboundary harm is an obligation of 'conduct' and not of 'result.' As hinted earlier, this means that due diligence requires a State of origin only to utilize the means reasonably available to it to meet this expectation, rather than succeeding at preventing or minimizing harm. Thus, the obligations imposed on States of origin are commensurate with their wherewithal—i.e., their cybersecurity capacities comprising financial, technical and institutional resources.\n\nConsider the question of technical means. The most prevalent forms of Botnets involve a 'command and control' server which sends instructions to Bots from specific web domains.[71] One method of disabling a Botnet is \"sinkholing\"—here, law enforcement takes control of these web domains, and redirects the Bot traffic to severs under their control.[72] When the Dutch police took over the Bredolab Botnet in 2010, it employed this method and used its server to notify all affected users that their devices had been compromised.[73] Could one then assume that whenever a Botnet emerges, with the Botmaster operating the command server in The Netherlands, the Dutch police can be presumed to have the means to sinkhole the Botnet? The answer is in negative.\n\nFor example, several Botmasters have employed techniques to generate mass false domain names, owing to which locating the command server becomes arduous.[74] In such cases, concerns arise as to collisions with legitimate domains when law enforcement attempts to target malicious domains.[75] In addition, as seen in the Mariposa Botnet takedown by Spanish authorities, not all Botnets use \"static malware\", meaning that Botmasters can often update the code of the malware infecting devices so as to prevent detection of the Botnet itself.[76] This is why despite several apparently successful attempts at taking down the Kelihos Botnet, it continued to\n\n66 Koivurova (n 30) Due Diligence, [1]–[2].\n\n69 Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 3 [3], [18].\n\n70 For this reason, some authors characterize due diligence as an obligation of 'common but differentiated responsibility' (CBDR).

These limited factors suffice to show that at times the very detection of a Botnet may surpass the technical capabilities of a State, let alone a takedown process. Thus, in the absence of knowledge of the Botnet's existence, the obligation to prevent transboundary harm would not even be triggered,79 as we elaborate in Triggers for due diligence obligations.\n\nWe harp on two points here. First, cybersecurity capacities vary drastically across States.80 The same conduct cannot generally be expected between so-called \"developed\" countries, \"developing\" and \"least developed\" (LDC) countries;81 or even between countries in comparable socio-economic brackets or the same region—given that their cyber capacities against particular threats can differ substantially.82 Second, to reiterate, due diligence requires highly factual assessments.83 Thus, to allege violations of due diligence, target States would have to prove that the concerned State of origin possessed the capacity to detect, mitigate or prevent transboundary Botnet-related harm in relation to the specific Botnet at hand.84\n\nDespite differences of capacity, some authors argue that there are certain measures for which any State should be presumed as capable—by the very virtue of being a State, such as the creation of legislations to penalize cybercrime.85 However, even the creation of regulations and corresponding enforcement agencies requires financial and technical investments.86 Therefore, the contents, scope and effectiveness of such domestic regimes may vary depending on State capacity, without violating due diligence. Therefore, one must be cautious when asserting any supposedly universal expectations under due diligence. At the same time, as State capacity advances, the standard of diligent conduct would also advance commensurably.87 Hence, if a State previously lacking cybercrime police, Botnet detection or mitigation techniques later\n\n77 Arsh Arora, 'Kelihos Botnet: A Never-Ending Saga' (Annual ADFSL Conference on Digital Forensics, Security and Law, 2017). <https: commons.erau.edu=\"\" cgi=\"\" cgi?viewcontent.cgi?article=\"1271&amp;context=adfsl\"> accessed 1 July 2022 9.\n78 Ahmad (n 71) Why Botnets Persist: Designing Effective Technical and Policy Interventions 9.\n79 Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 3 para [5] and [18]; Coco and de Souza Dias (n 20) 'Cyber Due Diligence': A Patchwork of Protective Obligations in International Law, 793–94.\n80 International Telecommunications Union, Global Cybersecurity Index 2020 Measuring commitment to cybersecurity (ITU Publications 2020); Andrea Calderaro and Anthony J.

Yet one is compelled to wonder if the evidentiary burden of a State to prove these variable factors may become self-defeating, negating the promising potential of due diligence in establishing State responsibility.\n\n## Evidentiary concerns\n\nIn proving the aforementioned facts, three considerations must be examined separately: the 'burden', 'method' and 'standard' of proof.⁸⁸ The burden of proof concerns whether certain facts must be proven by a particular party—as per the ICJ, the party alleging due diligence violations must prove the necessary facts.⁸⁹ The method of proving facts can either comprise direct or indirect evidence. In Nicaragua v. Costa Rica, the ICJ showed preference for direct scientific evidence, at least on the question of whether the harm alleged over the San Huan river was \"significant\".⁹⁰ Yet in Corfu Channel, the ICJ allowed \"liberal recourse\" to inferences from indirect (circumstantial) evidence proving Albania's knowledge of the placing of mines on its territory.⁹¹ This was because any direct evidence would have been in Albania's exclusive control.⁹² Analogizing, some authors argue that States litigating against cyber operations would face similar evidentiary obstacles, and thus, courts should be amenable to circumstantial digital evidence.⁹³\n\nHowever, even so, in Corfu Channel, the ICJ only found for the United Kingdom since its set of indirect evidence left \"no room for reasonable doubt\".⁹⁴ This is the 'standard' of proof—i.e., the extent to which the Court must be persuaded as to the existence of facts.⁹⁵ In later cases where the opposing State's direct evidence contradicted the available circumstantial evidence, this standard was not met for the ICJ.⁹⁶ This, in effect means that if States of origin are able to provide direct evidence contradicting the indirect evidence of target States on any count, the latter's case would likely fall. Crucially moreover, in Bosnian Genocide, the Court held that it would apply a higher standard of proof for charges of \"exceptional gravity\"—in that case, concerning the genocide prohibition.⁹⁷ With regard to proving due diligence allegations on factual significant harm in se, the Court has not indicated a precise standard of proof.⁹⁸ Yet at least for cases where applicant States found their submissions on due diligence as a measure of compliance for primary norms, the standards of proof may shift based on the \"gravity\" of the allegations.⁹⁹\n\nFinally, it should be acknowledged that the ICJ in Pulp Mills was asked by Argentina to grant similar flexibilities as in Corfu Channel; although the Court found no need to inquire into the request since it did not consider Argentina evidentially disadvantaged.¹⁰⁰ Moreover, to reiterate,\n\n⁸⁸ Michael P.

    "REVISITING DUE DILIGENCE IN CYBERSPACE\n331\n\nCorfu Channel did not concern the factual \"significant harm\" conception of due diligence, which arguably carries higher evidentiary scrutiny given its demands of scientific evidence.¹⁰¹ Thus, it remains open for States to argue that the standard of proof should be relaxed in case of States facing Botnet-related factual \"significant\" harms (when they are evidentially disadvantaged). It appears unlikely, however, that the Court would depart from its previous approaches.¹⁰²\n\nConsidering all this, and in light of the differential facts to be proven for asserting a specific standard of conduct as per the previous Sub-Section, one may be inclined to conclude that proving due diligence violations is in fact more difficult than for other norms—contrary to our view in The relevance of due diligence for cyberspace. While these challenges are certainly formidable, we hesitate to dismiss our preference for due diligence. First, the high standard of proof applied to presentations of circumstantial evidence would affect submissions on any norm violation in cyberspace, not just due diligence.¹⁰³ This would include attempts to attribute private actions to States of origin, the tests for which are in any case extremely stringent.¹⁰⁴ Accordingly and second, due diligence would help avoid impunity by facilitating indirect responsibility at least in certain cases.¹⁰⁵ This is especially for cases where the State of origin manifestly takes none or negligible efforts against the private group¹⁰⁶—i.e., it enabled the Botnet's administration by its unwillingness to act for whatever reason.\n\nTo reiterate, it could be difficult to prove violations of due diligence expectations that heavily hinge on State capacity (such as Botnet takedowns).¹⁰⁷ Perhaps, even proving the \"risk\" of \"significant\" harm could pose difficulties, as we discuss in Triggers for due diligence obligations. Nevertheless, there would be recourse at least when States of origin attempt unilateral measures against Botnets that could have potential impacts on other States. The target State could argue that a prior \"impact assessment\" should necessarily be held—so as to examine if \"significant\" harm may result from the measure.¹⁰⁸ Indeed, in Nicaragua v. Costa Rica, the ICJ found that Costa Rica violated this procedural requirement, even though it also considered that there was no risk of significant harm at the time.¹⁰⁹ As we elaborate in Impact Assessment Obligations Around Botnets, it is arguable that in conducting such impact assessments, the potentially affected States must be consulted, thus maximizing inter-State cooperation. In any case, when a risk of significant harm is found, the obligation to notify and co-operate with the other States would be triggered.¹¹⁰ Albania's omission to respect this very obligation was what entitled the United Kingdom for full compensation for the damage inflicted on its warships.¹¹¹ Therefore,\n\n¹⁰¹ Alan Boyle, 'Developments in the International Law of Environmental Impact Assessments and their Relation to the Espoo Convention' (2011) 20 Review of European Community &amp; International Environmental Law, 227.\n¹⁰² Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Croatia v.

In any case, the differential standard of conduct it imposes also protects the interests of States for whom higher expectations would have formed an \"undue burden\".¹¹³ Thus, on balance, this regime should remain until and unless distinct opinio juris arises in this regard. This backdrop having been set; we now turn to the spectrum of due diligence obligations specifically applicable to the context of Botnets.\n\n# TRIGGERS FOR DUE DILIGENCE OBLIGATIONS\n\nThis Section elaborates two conditions for different obligations under due diligence to apply: first, that the risk of harm should be significant, and second, that the State of origin must possess 'knowledge' of such risk. The first difficulty arises in defining which forms of harms posed by Botnets would be \"significant\".\n\n# Significant harms from Botnets\n\nAs regards factual significant harm, the ILC has argued that assessments of harm must be amenable to \"fast evolving technology\".¹¹⁴ While declining to provide clear metrics for measuring \"significance\", it argued that such harm can be somewhere between \"detectable and substantial\"—including harm to persons, property or the environment.¹¹⁵ As we shall elaborate, Botnets may cause tangible or intangible harm, to hardware, software, data and persons.¹¹⁶ A two-fold inquiry may be carried out concerning intrinsic or instrumental harm—for example, the ICJ examined whether the discharge of sediments into the San Huan river could in itself amount to significant harm against Nicaraguan territory, or if it could cause consequences amounting to such harm, such as the extinction of its fish species.¹¹⁷ In examining this, the Court considered the scale, magnitude and context of Costa Rica's road construction project.¹¹⁸\n\nThe first acknowledgement then is that not every Botnet is as such harmful—for instance, their use might be for innocuous purposes not amounting to harm, or at a low \"scale\".¹¹⁹ Theoretically, it is possible that despite infecting millions of devices (having a high scale), the Botnet only spreads harmless spam (having little magnitude), or that the devices are clearly secure against the effects the Botnets seeks to cause (in the context of these devices, it does not pose a risk of harm).¹²⁰ Yet it is also possible that despite infecting only a few hundred devices, it may cause\n\n¹¹² ILC Articles on Responsibility of States Articles 31, 34–38.\n¹¹³ Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 3 [3], [17], [12], [13], [11], [16]; Coco and de Souza Dias (n 20) 'Cyber Due Diligence': A Patchwork of Protective Obligations in International Law, 787-88; Buchan (n 20) Cyberspace, Non-State Actors and the Obligation to Prevent Transboundary Harm 443; Bannelier-Christakis (n 20) Cyber Diligence: A Low-Intensity Due Diligence Principle for Low-Intensity Cyber Operations? 37; Couzigou (n 62) Securing cyber space: the obligation of States to prevent harmful international cyber operations 47.\n¹¹⁴ Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 3 [11].\n¹¹⁵ Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 2 [4].\n¹¹⁶ Coco and de Souza Dias (n 20) 'Cyber Due Diligence': A Patchwork of Protective Obligations in International Law 793.\n¹¹⁷ Certain Activities Carried out by Nicaragua in the Border Area (Costa Rica v Nicaragua) and Construction of a Road in Costa Rica along the San Juan River (Nicaragua v Costa Rica) (Merits) [2015] ICJ Rep 200 [155], [192]–[217].\n¹¹⁸ ibid.

Costa Rica, the Court did indicate that when the harm to an object passes a “sort of critical level”,¹²³ the harm could be significant—integrity is the least controversial measure of this regard.\n\nThe assessment of intrinsic harm is complicated when the effects take other forms, such as against the confidentiality of the data of the device.¹²⁴ Consider the Corfu Channel conception of due diligence, which we argued in The relevance of due diligence for cyberspace as attaching due diligence to other primary norms (a violation of another international norm is presupposed as \"significant harm\"). The breach of confidentiality could involve the leak, deletion, or threats to interfere with data.¹²⁵ Some authors consider all such intrusions as arbitrary interferences with the primary norm of the right to privacy.¹²⁶ Others argue that States' positive obligation to protect human rights (which would include privacy) is one of due diligence.¹²⁷ Yet others contend, though not without opponents,¹²⁸ that this obligation applies extraterritorially—i.e., a State of origin would owe it to affected device-holders present in the target State.¹²⁹ Reading these views together, could one argue that every Botnet that affects the confidentiality of devices attracts the State of origin's due diligence obligations? While technically arguable, it could impose an undue burden on States given the sheer frequency of \"low-intensity\" cyber operations¹³⁰—and go against the logic that negligible harm is excluded from due diligence.¹³¹ This dilemma, in informal terms, puts due diligence in an awkward position.\n\nThe analysis would perhaps be clearer depending on the nature of the data, whether it forms part of \"critical\" infrastructure,¹³² the scale of mass data deletion; or to come to \"instrumental\" harms, the concrete effects on human life and property resulting from the Botnet—such as causing financial losses,¹³³ the rigging of ballot machines to distort votes,¹³⁴ manipulating stock markets by using algorithmic trading from the Bots,¹³⁵ spreading hate speech on mass scales to\n\n¹²¹ Kim Zetter, 'An Unprecedented Look at Stuxnet, the World's First Digital Weapon' (Wired, 3 Nov 2014) <https: 11=\"\" 2014=\"\" countdown-to-zero-day-stuxnet=\"\" www.wired.com=\"\"></https:> accessed 15 May 2022.\n¹²² David Kushner, 'The Real Story of Stuxnet' (IEE Spectrum, 23 February 2013) <https: spectrum.ieee.org=\"\" the-real-story-of-stuxnet=\"\" the-real-story-of-stuxnet=\"\"></https:> accessed 1 July 2022; Saleh Soltan, Prateek Mittal, and H.

For example, whether mass disinformation campaigns run through Botnets, in the context of pandemics,¹³⁷ elections¹³⁸ or otherwise could be considered “significant” would necessarily depend on the facts and empirics of each case.¹³⁹ Such factors could include the scale of the Botnet, the nature of the disinformation, and the social context at hand.¹⁴⁰\n\nFrom this long discussion, we conclude the following. First, that a variety of distinct cyber threats posed by Botnets may give rise to risks of significant transboundary harm. Second, at the same time, it is crucial for States to elaborate their views on what forms of cyber threats they consider as such harms, whether intrinsically or instrumentally, given that many cases presently involve ambiguity. Third, in any case, the examination of a risk of significant harm would necessarily be a case-to-case basis test. The same goes for the potential effects of any response measures that States of origin may wish to take against transboundary Botnets, which we elaborate in Mitigating or preventing Botnet-related harms. These complications are why, in Impact assessment obligations around Botnets, we emphasize the need for respecting the obligation¹⁴¹ to conduct an “impact assessment” to examine if significant harm may arise from Botnet response measures that could potentially affect other States.\n\n# The state of origin's knowledge\n\nIt is crucial that a great majority of due diligence obligations: that to notify potentially affected States of the risk of significant harm from private or its own activities; and to co-operate with them in order to mitigate, minimize or prevent such harm, all take for granted that the State of origin knows of the existence of this risk.¹⁴² Such knowledge can be either actual or constructive, the latter meaning that in the circumstances of a case, a diligent State ought to or can be presumed to have known of the risk.¹⁴³ As examples, in Corfu Channel, the constant surveillance of Albanian forces close to areas where mines were placed indicated its constructive knowledge as to the presence of the mines;¹⁴⁴ while in Bosnian Genocide, the fact that international bodies and other States continually expressed concerns that genocide may transpire was taken to prove Serbia and Montenegro's constructive knowledge to that effect.¹⁴⁵ Thus, for example, a State of origin's knowledge can be presumed if its own cyber infrastructure was frequently exploited by the private Botnet.¹⁴⁶ Alternatively, as has often been the case,¹⁴⁷ if the target State, other States or private actors publicize the existence of a harmful Botnet, the aforesaid obligations of the State of origin would activate.\n\n¹³⁶ Coco, and de Souza Dias (n 30) Cyber due diligence in international law 77; HRC, 'Report of the independent international fact-finding mission on Myanmar' (12 September 2018) UN Doc.

    "REVISITING DUE DILIGENCE IN CYBERSPACE\n335\n\nYet recall that as per Factors affecting standard of conduct, the very detection of Botnets, including the harms they may be causing, requires a minimal set-up of cyber monitoring capabilities. In the absence of such capacity, neither would the State of origin be capable of apprising itself as to Botnet risks, nor could constructive knowledge be realistically imputed to it.¹⁴⁸ In that event, some have speculated that States may use their capacity deficiencies as excuses to evade the above spectrum of obligations.¹⁴⁹ We address this dilemma later in The obligation toward cyber capacity building of the article, where we submit that due diligence obligates continuous State efforts toward cyber capacity building. In the next Section, we discuss the obligation of States of origin to conduct impact assessments in order to secure knowledge of any risks of significant Botnet-related transboundary harm from their territory.\n\n# IMPACT ASSESSMENT OBLIGATIONS AROUND BOTNETS\n\nIn Triggers for due diligence obligations, we outlined the trigger thresholds for the majority of due diligence obligations to apply for a State of origin—knowledge, and the risk of significant transboundary harm. Later in Mitigating or preventing Botnet-related harms, we finally address the specific conduct expected of States of States once the trigger thresholds described in Triggers for due diligence obligations are met.\n\nHowever, before that stage, we begin in this Section by unpacking the earlier stage where there is a preliminary risk of harm to other States—yet it remains uncertain whether the risked harm could be \"significant\". In such situations, we argue that States of origin must conduct impact assessments to examine whether there is a risk of \"significant\" harm from the Botnet or their response measures. First, we outline the contents of the obligation to conduct impact assessments as also an inexhaustive list of factors that these assessments should consider against contemporary Botnets. Second, we discuss impact assessment techniques employed by States thus far and their interplay with differential State capacities. Finally, we elaborate certain miscellaneous questions as to the scope of this obligation that require the urgent attention of States.\n\n# Setting the law and context\n\nThe ICJ has recognized that in case of a preliminary risk of harm, States are customarily bound to conduct impact assessments to discover if the concerned harm could be \"significant\".¹⁵⁰ If such a risk becomes apparent, the State of origin must notify and consult the potentially affected States and take measures to mitigate the potential harm.¹⁵¹ Upon discovering suspicious Botnets, a \"preliminary risk\" of this nature must be presupposed given their inherent potential for malicious uses, as described in Significant Harms From Botnets. There is also a frequent affirmation of the need for prior impact assessments in cyberspace.¹⁵² For example, in reference to due diligence, the Council of Europe considers that States must assess if a \"disruption or interference\n\n¹⁴⁸ Buchan (n 20) Cyberspace, Non-State Actors and the Obligation to Prevent Transboundary Harm 443; Bannelier-Christakis (n 20) Cyber Diligence: A Low-Intensity Due Diligence Principle for Low-Intensity Cyber Operations? 37; Couzigou (n 62) Securing cyber space: the obligation of States to prevent harmful international cyber operations 47.\n¹⁴⁹ O.

Indeed, without proper vigilance, States of origin could inadvertently harm the integrity and functionality of foreign devices, which may even include other States' critical digital infrastructure.¹⁵⁶\n\nThe ICJ appreciates that States have discretion in deciding the exact modalities of these impact assessments; however, the assessment must account for the \"nature and magnitude\" of the transboundary activity, its likely adverse impact on States, and the need to \"exercise due diligence\" in its conduct.¹⁵⁷ The ILC has taken a similar position, while elaborating that the likely effects on persons, property and environment of the States should be considered,¹⁵⁸ as we described in Significant harms from Botnets. In any event, the assessment should be rooted in \"scientific\" evidence.¹⁵⁹ Based on these legal compulsions and our research on contemporary Botnets, the following are some inexhaustive factors that could inform an effective impact assessment. Needless to add, future Botnets may evolve such that these factors prove inadequate to examine their activities.¹⁶⁰ Our analysis only serves to illustrate the rigor that ought to be expected from States.\n\nFirst, examining the 'size' of the Botnet (the number of Bots) can indicate the potency of its threat and its unique geographical spread,¹⁶¹ which may necessitate international co-operation. Relatedly, determining the locations of foreign devices can enable measures such as notifying users in order to remove malwares from the devices.¹⁶² Second, inquiring the precise activities pursued by the Botnets can indicate the nature of harm they could cause, as described in Significant harms from Botnets. In fact, Botnets are frequently used to earn revenue by illegal activities such as mass spam or theft.¹⁶³ Thus, to meaningfully counter the threat of Botnets in the long-term, it is imperative to cut such streams of revenue that serve as incentives\n\n¹⁵³ Council of Europe, 'Recommendation CM/Rec (2011)8 of the Committee of Ministers to member states on the protection and promotion of the universality, integrity and openness of the Internet' (21 September 2011) <https: cm=\"\" pages=\"\" result_details.aspx?objectid=\"09000016805cc2f8\" search.coe.int=\"\"> accessed 1st July 2022; Council of Europe, 'Explanatory Memorandum to the draft Recommendation CM/Rec(2011)... of the Committee of Ministers to member states on the protection and promotion of Internet's universality, integrity and openness', (CM Documents, CM(2011)115–add1, 24 August 2011) <https: cm=\"\" pages=\"\" result_details.aspx?objectid=\"09000016805ccaeb\" search.coe.int=\"\"> accessed 1 July 2022 [79].\n¹⁵⁴ ibid.\n¹⁵⁵ Stockburger (n 104) Control and Capabilities Test: Toward a New Lex Specialis Governing State Responsibility for Third Party Cyber Incidents 259–60.\n¹⁵⁶ Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 90.\n¹⁵⁷ Pulp Mills [205]; Certain Activities Carried out by Nicaragua in the Border Area (Costa Rica v Nicaragua) and Construction of a Road in Costa Rica along the San Juan River (Nicaragua v Costa Rica) (Merits) [2015] ICJ Rep 200 [104].\n¹⁵⁸ Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 7 [7]–[8].\n¹⁵⁹ Boyle (n 101) Developments in the International Law of Environmental Impact Assessments and their Relation to the Espoo Convention 230.\n¹⁶⁰ Mayra Rosario Fuentes and other, 'The Future of P2P IoT Botnets' (Trend Micro, 11 March 2021) <https: 21=\"\" en_in=\"\" ec=\"\" c=\"\" the-future-of-p2p-iot-botnets.html=\"\" research=\"\" www.trendmicro.com=\"\"> accessed 1 July 2022; Ben Dickson, 'IoT botnets might be the cybersecurity industry's next big worry' (IOT Security Foundation, 12 July 2016) <https: 07=\"\" 12=\"\" 2016=\"\" bdtechtalks.com=\"\" iot-botnets-might-be-the-cybersecurity-industrys-next-big-worry=\"\"></https:> accessed 1 July 2022; Shailaja Shankar, 'Ghosts of Botnets Past, Present, and Future' (McAfee, 17 December 2018) <https: blogs=\"\" internet-security=\"\" ghosts-of-botnets-past-present-and-future=\"\" www.mcafee.com=\"\"></https:> accessed 1 July 2022.\n¹⁶¹ Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 26–28.\n¹⁶² BBC (n 73); Zeitlin (n 72) Botnet Takedowns and the Fourth Amendment, 753–754.\n¹⁶³ Ogu and others (n 10) A Botnets Circumspection: The Current Threat Landscape, and What We Know So Far 11–12.</https:></https:></https:>",

Third, securing information on the method of propagation of the Botnet and other technicalities such as its malware can assist law enforcement in halting and preventing its spread in the future.¹⁶⁵ Finally, the architecture and communication protocol of the Botnet must be ascertained to understand the appropriate methods to eradicate the Botnet, as also the likely effects of such methods on affected devices.¹⁶⁶ This is of course not to suggest that these factors are to be universally followed, since the extent of diligence expected from States varies with their respective capacities.¹⁶⁷ We turn to this dilemma in the next Sub-Section.\n\n## Differential capacities for assessment techniques\n\nOperationalizing the aforementioned factors requires recourse to one or a combination of various methods—categorized as ‘passive’ or ‘active’ techniques.¹⁶⁸ On the facts of each Botnet, one technique might be more strategically appropriate than the other.¹⁶⁹ Passive techniques are relatively stealthier and do not interfere with the Botnets directly,¹⁷⁰ such as analysis of spam records, and anti-virus software feedback;¹⁷¹ though we do not elaborate all such techniques in this article. Active techniques in contrast are relatively more intrusive but offer greater accuracy and reliability in their findings.¹⁷² In construing ‘diligence’, States possessing capacities to deploy either forms of technique may be obligated to determine and utilize the technique most appropriate against a particular Botnet, or at least attempt to do so.\n\nAn example of active technique is the method of sinkholing—which involves the redirection of Bots from the Botmaster’s malicious domain servers to law enforcement-controlled domain servers.¹⁷³ This technique, which is also characterized as a Domain Name System (DNS) approach, takes for granted that States have a certain amount of technical and financial resources.¹⁷⁴ It also necessitates cooperation with DNS operators, most of whom would be private actors; in the event of their refusal to co-operate, sinkholing can only be pursued if the operators can be legally compelled to that end.¹⁷⁵ Yet that takes for granted the presence of a legal framework that criminalizes cybercriminal acts such as Botnets, enabling the State to compel co-operation. As recently as 2020, it was found in a survey of 194 countries that around 27 countries do not even possess such laws.¹⁷⁶ The situation is worsened in the event that the DNS operator, service provider or corporation is not subject to the State of origin’s enforcement jurisdiction—in which case co-operation with other States would also have to be pursued to proceed.¹⁷⁷ Evidently, toward States of origin presently lacking these necessary capacities, it would be an “undue burden” to expect sophisticated sinkholing techniques.

In the end, this would benefit not only less capable States, but also the international community at large—as capacity-building would enable the former to better discharge their obligations as States of origin, as we shall argue in The obligation toward cyber capacity building. To reiterate, as the technological capabilities of States advance, the rigour expected in their impact assessments would also increase under due diligence.¹⁸⁴ By the same metric, if Botnet threats advance further beyond a State's renewed capabilities, the State would not be faulted for ineffective impact assessments as long as it invests its best efforts.¹⁸⁵\n\n## Miscellaneous debates\n\nBefore proceeding to the next Section on the specific obligations to mitigate and prevent Botnet-related harms, we consider it crucial to outline three unresolved questions as to the scope of the impact assessment obligation. First, some authors have argued for a universal obligation on States to conduct continuous 'monitoring' against cyber threats such as Botnets under due diligence.¹⁸⁶ Seemingly, this connects to the impact assessment stage. In our view, other scholars are correct in responding that general monitoring falls outside its scope,¹⁸⁷ since the obligation is only triggered in the event of a \"preliminary risk\" of harm.¹⁸⁸ Others further argue that this would pose capacity concerns even for developed States, or at least difficulties in making such monitoring conform to human rights safeguards.¹⁸⁹ Yet we further submit that general monitoring\n\n¹⁷⁸ Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 71–73; Do Le Quoc, André Martin, and Christof Fetzer, 'Scalable and Real-Time Deep Packet Inspection' (IEEE/ACM 6th International Conference on Utility and Cloud Computing, 2013) 446–451.\n¹⁷⁹ Generally, see footnote 191.\n¹⁸⁰ Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 72–74.\n¹⁸¹ ITU (n 176) Global Cybersecurity Index 2020 131–134.\n¹⁸² ibid. 7.\n¹⁸³ Ahmad (n 71) Why Botnets Persist: Designing Effective Technical and Policy Interventions 31–35.\n¹⁸⁴ Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 3 [3], [17], [12], [13], [11], [16]; Coco, and de Souza Dias (n 20) 'Cyber Due Diligence': A Patchwork of Protective Obligations in International Law 787–88; Buchan (n 20) Cyberspace, Non-State Actors and the Obligation to Prevent Transboundary Harm 443; Bannelier-Christakis (n 20) Cyber Diligence: A Low-Intensity Due Diligence Principle for Low-Intensity Cyber Operations? 37.\n¹⁸⁵ ibid.\n¹⁸⁶ O.

The issue, however, is that necessity imposes a stringent test, one that has never been met before the ICJ. In this vein, there could be cases where States of origin fail the obligation to conduct impact assessments for reasons that are legitimate but fall below necessity. The ICJ was asked in Nicaragua v. Costa Rica to find that an \"emergency\" situation could preclude the obligation of holding impact assessments;¹⁹³ however, the Court avoided this legal question by factually finding that there were no circumstances resembling an emergency.¹⁹⁴ This, therefore, remains a question that ought to be debated and clarified by States in their positions on cyber-law or a future treaty on the subject.\n\nFinally, it is accepted that once a risk of \"significant\" harm is determined, the State of origin must co-operate and consult potentially affected States in good faith.¹⁹⁵ Yet some consider that inter-State co-operation is crucial even during the prior stage of impact assessments.¹⁹⁶ The basis for this assertion is that an accurate examination of the likely harms cannot be facilitated without co-operation from affected States, given their position to directly appreciate the risk posed to their territory¹⁹⁷—here, foreign devices infected by the Botnet. This question too was raised in the case of Nicaragua v. Costa Rica but avoided by the ICJ on grounds of judicial economy.¹⁹⁸ Given the ramifications of this question, we hope to see clearer articulations from States as to their co-operation obligations concerning threats such as Botnets. That said, we now turn to the spectrum of obligations triggered once a risk of significant harm does in fact arise.\n\n# MITIGATING OR PREVENTING BOTNET-RELATED HARMS\n\nTo reiterate once again, States of origin must use all means at their disposal to prevent or mitigate harm to target States emanating from the former's territory.¹⁹⁹ This due diligence obligation would arise either upon the State's own impact assessment or by constructive knowledge as\n\n¹⁹⁰ General monitoring which entails deep packet inspection at scale requires significant computing power.

    "ABHIJEET SHRIVASTAVA AND RUDRAKSH LAKRA\n\nelaborated in The state of origin's knowledge as to the risk of \"significant\" transboundary harm. The mitigating measures the State must take depend on the nature of the harm (including its \"seriousness\" and \"likelihood\"²⁰⁰), the State's capacity, and other circumstances of the case.²⁰¹ The harm in question may result from either the Botnet itself, or through response measures taken by the State of origin against the Botnet. We do not propose that there are specific forms of measures that are universal expectations against any and all Botnets. The purpose of this Section is only to provide an account of contemporary mitigating measures that in our view serve as good practices that depending on the facts, could likely meet the States' due diligence obligations. Like before, we also acknowledge capacity differentials in the discussion.\n\nWe consider five forms of measures that together could entirely mitigate Botnet-related harms: first, the takeover or takedown of the Botnet, second, the subsequent clean-up of infected devices, third, the fixing of software or hardware vulnerabilities that allowed the Botnet's propagation, fourth, the arrest and prosecution of the Botmaster, and finally, efforts against any financial incentives that may have led to the creation of the Botnets.\n\nBeginning categorically, the takedown of Botnets involves identifying the gaps in the Botnet's functioning and architecture to thereafter disable or bring it down.²⁰² This measure requires tremendous technical and financial wherewithal as it involves a specialized response to each unique Botnet;²⁰³ it is challenging even for developed States and major private corporations.²⁰⁴ Despite this, it might only provide a fleeting control since the Botmaster would resist takedowns using defence and contingencies.²⁰⁵ Given this, Microsoft's takedowns have failed so often that it has begun instead referring to these attempts as Botnet \"disruptions\".²⁰⁶ To illustrate further, Microsoft botched its attempt to takedown the ZeroAccess Botnet owing to its omission to account for the P2P structure of the Botnet, meaning that the malware on devices was self-executing—and did not respond to a command server.²⁰⁷ Alternatively, Botnets can often have multiple command servers, and the failure to eradicate all such servers has previously enabled their resurgence.²⁰⁸ Clearly, the nature, architecture and protocols of the Botnet could necessitate careful strategies. Thus, it would be absurd to consider Botnet takedowns or takeovers as a universal expectation from even States of origin with high cyber capabilities, let alone developing States and LDCs. There is a need for inter-State and private-State cooperation for collective capacity-building efforts in this regard.\n\nAs to the second measure, even if a State of origin somehow manages to takedown Botnets—it should attempt to disinfect or clean the malware left on affected devices if the State possesses the necessary capacity. This is because the malware leftovers also pose great risks to the \"stability and behaviour\" of the devices.²⁰⁹ In fact, in the Conflicker Botnet, the leftover malware of the Botnet disabled the security and update mechanisms of five million affected devices.²¹⁰ It is also possible for such leftover malware to join the devices as part of a new Botnet.²¹¹\n\n200 Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 3 [11], [18].\n201 Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 3 [11], [18], [12], [17]; Coco, and de Souza Dias (n 20) 'Cyber Due Diligence': A Patchwork of Protective Obligations in International Law 787-88.\n202 Ahmad (n 71) Why Botnets Persist: Designing Effective Technical and Policy Interventions, 14.\n203 Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 113\n204 Zeitlin (n 72) Botnet Takedowns and the Fourth Amendment 751-56.\n205 ibid.\n206 Mathew J.

    "REVISITING DUE DILIGENCE IN CYBERSPACE\n341\n\nThe \"clean-up\" process could take three presently common forms. One is to takeover the Botnet's command server to send a notification to users with instructions to uninstall the malware, as the Dutch police demonstrated against the Bredolab Botnet.²¹² Yet this method has several drawbacks. For example, there are often peculiar communication chains in Botnets under which the devices may not promptly receive notifications from the taken-over command server.²¹³ Further, some empirical work shows that users may question the legitimacy of these notifications, given the prevalence of false malware alert scams.²¹⁴ Since control over the command server could be fleeting, giving rise to urgencies, additional measures such as letter or telephonic warnings,²¹⁵ and maintaining a helpdesk such as the German Anti-Botnet initiative²¹⁶ may resolve this concern. However, these measures also require immense technical and financial wherewithal and thus cannot be universal expectations, even if effective.\n\nA second method to clean-up malware is for law enforcement to unilaterally command the Bots to delete the malware on the infected computers,²¹⁷ akin to the United States approach against the Coreflood Botnet²¹⁸ and Microsoft's against the Citadel Botnets in 2013.²¹⁹ The third method involves unilaterally patching the flaw in the security system of the devices that facilitated the installation of malware to begin with.²²⁰ Apart from being measures that only highly technologically advanced States could be expected to pursue, both these methods carry strong privacy concerns owing to their disregard for user consent.²²¹ This may also allow law enforcement to gain unconsented access to personal data,²²² highlighting the need for human-rights centric legal frameworks regulating Botnet-response measures.²²³ These unilateral measures could also cause unforeseen side effects and should therefore be contemplated cautiously.²²⁴ A State of origin proposing such measures would be bound to conduct prior impact assessments as detailed in Impact assessment obligations around Botnets; as also to co-operate with the potentially affected States. If it undertakes unilateral Botnet takedown or malware clean-up measures that result in significant harm to devices in other States, without having taken appropriate steps to mitigate such harm, it would be in violation of its due diligence obligations.²²⁵\n\nAs to the remaining common measures, the fixing of software or hardware vulnerabilities that enabled the Botnet's propagation is crucial to improve cybersecurity resilience, such that a similar Botnet does not emerge in the future.²²⁶ The arrest and prosecution of Botmasters would ensure that the same cybercriminals do not rebuild the Botnet once taken down, while\n\n²¹² BBC (n 73).\n²¹³ Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 110; Ahmad (n 71) Why Botnets Persist: Designing Effective Technical and Policy Interventions 12–13.\n²¹⁴ Wei Meng et and others, 'DNS Changer Remediation Study' (Presentation at the Messaging, Malware, and Mobile Anti-Abuse Working Group 27th General Meeting 7, 19 February 2013) <https: GeorgiaTech_DNSChanger_study-2013-02-19.pdf=\"\" files=\"\" news=\"\" www.m3aawg.org=\"\"> accessed 1 July 2022.\n²¹⁵ Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 111. ibid, page 93.\n²¹⁷ Zeitlin (n 72) 753–54.\n²¹⁸ Brian Krebs, 'FBI Scrubbed 19,000 PCs Snared by Coreflood Botnet' (Krebs On Security, 21 June 2011) <https: attacks-breaches=\"\" microsoft-fails-to-nuke-zeroaccess-botnet=\"\" www.darkreading.com=\"\"> accessed 1 July 2022.\n²¹⁹ In 2013 after sinkholing Citadel botnets used its command infrastructure to update the malware on infected computers.

Yet one commonality across all is the need for international co-operation in their success—cyber capabilities can only flourish best with collective efforts;²²⁹ arrests and prosecutions of transnational cybercriminals can only concretize with mutual legal assistance; and the social evils enabling Botnets eradicated with concerted diplomatic initiatives.²³⁰ It seems then, that due diligence is not only a gap-filling legal arsenal against Botnets amidst the presently mutually suspicious²³¹ State relations in cyberspace; instead, due diligence must also be viewed as a norm that can realize its maximal potential only in a milieu where States develop robust co-operative and consultative efforts. In that vein, it may well become a vehicle for facilitating internationalism in cyberspace, in line with its core logic. This brings us to the final Section of this article, where we detail the overarching obligation of all States toward cyber capacity building, as also the role of international co-operation in its fruition.\n\n# THE OBLIGATION TOWARD CYBER CAPACITY BUILDING\n\nAs previously discussed in Factors affecting standard of conduct and The state of origin's knowledge, the obligation of due diligence is a 'duty of conduct'; yet that carries within it an obligation which is a 'duty of result.'²³² This obligation is to build a 'minimum' institutional capacity that would allow States to effectively carry out their due diligence obligations.²³³ This framework should equip the State to be able to detect potential significant harm and to take appropriate mitigating measures to minimize and prevent the harm. This aspect of due diligence has been recognized by the ILC²³⁴ and ICJ.²³⁵ For capacity building, States should make reasonable efforts to create an ability to detect risk, and the capability to mitigate and halt that risk. This obligation of result is necessary for the due diligence norms to have any bite. States including South Korea, Canada, the United Kingdom and Australia in their report on incorporating UNGGE non-binding norms have focused on the building of institutional capacity.²³⁶ These have included raising awareness, creating an appropriate legislative framework, creating or strengthening departments for countering cyber threats, developing incident response plans and domestic policy, and enabling cooperative partnerships—both domestic and international.²³⁷ As with other due diligence obligations, the minimum baseline that is expected of States would differ based\n\n²²⁷ ibid 121.\n\n²²⁸ Ahmad (n 71) Why Botnets Persist: Designing Effective Technical and Policy Interventions, 29–31.\n\n²²⁹ Supra Section on Impact Assessment Obligations Around Botnets\n\n²³⁰ Fausto Pocar, 'New Challenges for International Rules Against Cyber-Crime' (2004) 10 European Journal on Criminal Policy and Research 27.\n\n²³¹ Ney and Zimmermann (n 18) Cyber-Security beyond the Military Perspective: International Law, Cyberspace, and the Concept of Due Diligence.\n\n²³² Coco, and de Souza Dias (n 20) 'Cyber Due Diligence': A Patchwork of Protective Obligations in International Law, 788; Russel Buchan, 'Cyberspace, Non-State Actors and the Obligation to Prevent Transboundary Harm' (2019) 21 Journal of Conflict &amp; Security Law (2016) 429, 434–439.\n\n²³³ ibid; ILC, Draft Articles on Prevention Article 3 [15]–[17]; Couzigou (n 62) Securing cyber space: the obligation of States to prevent harmful international cyber operations 50–51.\n\n²³⁴ Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 3 [14]–[17], Article 5.\n\n²³⁵ Pulp Mills [197].\n\n²³⁶ Andraz Kastelic, \"Due Diligence in Cyberspace: Normative Expectations of Reciprocal Protection of International Legal Rights\" (UNIDIR, 2021) <https: due-diligence-cyberspace-normative-expectations-reciprocal-protection-international=\"\" publication=\"\" www.unidir.org=\"\"> accessed 1 June 2022, 10.\n\n²³⁷ ibid.</https:>",

Such indicators would also serve to illustrate the conduct expected from States as technologies and Botnet threats evolve.²³⁹ Further, States are free to design their institutional baseline as long as it is adequate for the harm in question.²⁴⁰ While being mindful of capacity differentials of States, we divide these baseline measures into six categories: national/sectoral cybersecurity strategies, legal measures, measures focusing on preventing Botnet infection, on early detection of botnets, collaborative measures, and review-related measures.\n\n## National/Sectoral cybersecurity strategies\n\nStates have limited resources and regulatory capacities. Due diligence recognizes this central pillar of policymaking²⁴¹ and accordingly, it requires states to use their best efforts based on their capabilities.²⁴² To allocate their resources and the regulatory capacity in an economically efficient manner, States should create a strategy for countering threats akin to Botnets based on a risk-based approach, which would help the State identify threats and security gaps that pose a high risk and those that pose a low risk.²⁴³ Based on this level of risk assessment, the State can focus its resources on priority areas where high-risk vulnerabilities exist. This process can be and should ideally be performed both nationally and sectorally.²⁴⁴\n\nNational cybersecurity strategies should become the cornerstone that guides State measures and initiatives.²⁴⁵ Special focus should be on strengthening and making their networks more resilient to support critical infrastructure, critical supply chains and major financial institutions.²⁴⁶ Such a National Cybersecurity strategy can also be developed based on a multi-stakeholder approach as recommended by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU).²⁴⁷ As regards feasibility, the most States should be able to draw up these strategies as it only requires states to take stock of their resources, their regulatory capacity and the landscape of threats faced by them. Indeed, as of 2020, the ITU found that 127 countries out of 194 countries have now adopted a National Cyber Strategy.²⁴⁸\n\n## Legal measures\n\nA suitable legal and regulatory framework is the bedrock of due diligence. As the ILC in their Draft Articles on Transboundary Harm notes, “[s]tates concerned shall take the necessary legislative, administrative or other action…”²⁴⁹. The legal framework should lay out relevant rights\n\n²³⁸ Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 3 [12]–[13] 17; Coco, and de Souza Dias (n 20) Cyber Due Diligence: A Patchwork of Protective Obligations in International Law 787-88; Buchan (n 20) Cyberspace, Non-State Actors and the Obligation to Prevent Transboundary Harm 443; Bannelier-Christakis (n 20) Cyber Diligence: A Low-Intensity Due Diligence Principle for Low-Intensity Cyber Operations? 37; Couzigou (n 62) Securing cyber space: the obligation of States to prevent harmful international cyber operations 47.\n\n²³⁹ Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 3 [11].\n\n²⁴⁰ Coco, and de Souza Dias (n 20) Cyber Due Diligence: A Patchwork of Protective Obligations in International Law, 787-88.\n\n²⁴¹ OECD, OECD Regulatory Policy Outlook 2021: Risk-based regulation (OECD Publishing, 2021).\n\n²⁴² Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 3 [3], [5].\n\n²⁴³ ITU, 'ITU Botnet Mitigation Toolkit' (Jan 2008) ITU Telecommunication Development Sector <https: cyp=\"\" itub-cyb=\"\" cyp/ecybersecurity=\"\" docs=\"\" itu-botnet-mitigation-toolkit-background.pdf=\"\" www.itu.int=\"\"> accessed 1 July 2022, 25; Shackelford, Russell and Kuehn (n 84) Unpacking the International Law on Cybersecurity Due Diligence: Lessons from the Public and Private Sectors 34-42.\n\n²⁴⁴ Coco, and de Souza Dias (n 30) Cyber due diligence in international law 187-190.\n\n²⁴⁵ ITU (n 176) Global Cybersecurity Index 2020 145-47; ITU (n 243) Botnet Mitigation Toolkit 25.\n\n²⁴⁶ ibid.\n\n²⁴⁷ ibid.\n\n²⁴⁸ ibid.\n\n²⁴⁹ Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 5.</https:>",

States should ensure that the definition of the crimes adopted by the law should not be such that it succumbs to obsolescence very soon with technological changes.²⁵⁴ A possible approach for this is to define cyber-criminal activities at a high level of abstraction, which would also cover crimes unforeseeable at the time.²⁵⁵ This is in line with the approach in the Budapest Convention.²⁵⁶ Further in line with the Budapest Convention and other such initiatives, it is important to push for creating a uniform and common legislative baseline framework across jurisdictions, so that Botmasters could not exploit any difference in laws in different countries.²⁵⁷ In this regard, there is presently wide disagreement between States about the precise content of crimes beyond core crimes, as presently seen in ongoing debates under the UN’s auspices around a cybercrime treaty.²⁵⁸ This disagreement limits the possibility of harmonization, and thus, one hopes that a representative consensus is reached.\n\nRegarding the second proposed objective for laws, as Lubin explains, using existing domestic legal remedies such as injunction orders can be inappropriate for Botnet mitigation.²⁵⁹ Thus, the law should provide remedies and procedural tools which accommodate the uniqueness of cyberspace and facilitate suitable resources tailored for Botnet mitigation. The question of which procedural tools law enforcement should have can again be resolved by drawing from international standards.²⁶⁰ There is also a need to build regulatory capacity in a manner that Botnet mitigation operations could be approved at a quicker pace and the body adjudicating these requests is well versed in the specific practical and technical details.²⁶¹ Having a quicker turnaround period is important as Botnets are constantly evolving.²⁶² Consequently, responses against them can quickly become antiquated.\n\n²⁵⁰ Coco, and de Souza Dias (n 30) Cyber due diligence in international law 171.\n²⁵¹ ibid.\n²⁵² Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 121–22, 125, 127; ITU (n 243) Botnet Mitigation Toolkit 21–31.\n²⁵³ For instance see, Convention on Cybercrime (adopted 23 Nov 2001, entered into force 1 July 2004) 2296 UNTS 167; Arab Convention on Combating Information Technology Offences (adopted 21 December 2010); African Union Convention on Cyber Security and Personal Data Protection (adopted 27 June 2014); UNODC, ‘Second session of the Ad Hoc Committee’ (Second session of the Ad Hoc Committee to Elaborate a Comprehensive International Convention on Countering the Use of Information and Communications Technologies for Criminal Purposes, 2022) <https: ad_hoc_committee=\"\" chc-second-session.html=\"\" en=\"\" www.unodc.org=\"\"> accessed 1 July 2022; ITU (n 243) Botnet Mitigation Toolkit.\n²⁵⁴ Gerard (n 6) Botnet Mitigation and International Law 226.\n²⁵⁵ ibid.\n²⁵⁶ ibid.\n²⁵⁷ Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 25.\n²⁵⁸ Tomaso Falchetta, Deborah Brown and Katitza Rodriguez, ‘Opening Stages in UN Cybercrime Treaty Talks Reflect Human Rights Risks’ (Just Security, 18 April 2022) <https: 81105=\"\" apri=\"\" opening-stages-in-un-cybercrime-treaty-talks-reflect-human-rights-risks=\"\" www.justsecurity.org=\"\"></https:> accessed 30 June 2022.\n²⁵⁹ Lubin, and Marinotti (n 175) Why Current Botnet Takedown Jurisprudence Should Not Be Replicated.\n²⁶⁰ For instance see, Convention on Cybercrime (adopted 23 Nov 2001, entered into force 1 July 2004) 2296 UNTS 167; Arab Convention on Combating Information Technology Offences (adopted 21 Dec 2010); African Union Convention on Cyber Security and Personal Data Protection (adopted 27 June 2014); UNODC, ‘Second session of the Ad Hoc Committee’ (Second session of the Ad Hoc Committee to Elaborate a Comprehensive International Convention on Countering the Use of Information and Communications Technologies for Criminal Purposes, 2022) <https: ad_hoc_committee=\"\" chc-second-session.html=\"\" en=\"\" www.unodc.org=\"\"> accessed 1 July 2022; ITU (n 243) Botnet Mitigation Toolkit.\n²⁶¹ Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 116, 126.\n²⁶² ibid.</https:></https:>",
    "REVISITING DUE DILIGENCE IN CYBERSPACE\n345\n\nIt is important to acknowledge that any such legal and regulatory framework should draw a practical balance between enforcement interests and human rights, especially the right to privacy.²⁶³ This is because the principle of due diligence needs to be exercised in compliance with a State's other international legal obligations.²⁶⁴ To elaborate, whenever the right of privacy is implicated, the measure should meet the requirement of legality (accessibility, foresight, independent oversight and data protection safeguards), necessity and proportionality.²⁶⁵ This is linked to our earlier discussion in Mitigating or preventing Botnet-related harms as to how privacy should be taken into account when conducting mitigation measures.\n\nA final observation is required for the question of the State's capacity to undertake legal and regulatory measures. Some authors have argued that all states are presumably capable of creating such a framework. However, as we highlighted in Factors affecting standard of conduct and Differential capacities for assessment techniques, even creating cybercrime legislation tailored to the threat of Botnet would require financial and technical investments.²⁶⁶ To reiterate, as of 2020, 27 countries out of 194 surveyed by ITU did not have any cybercrime-specific legislations.²⁶⁷ Moreover, even if States had cyber-specific legislations, having an adequate regulatory capacity to enforce it could be particularly challenging for LDCs and certain developing states, as discussed earlier.²⁶⁸\n\n## Measures for preventing Botnet infections\n\nPreventive efforts against Botnets can be much more effective than combating Botnet-related threats once the Botnet mushrooms into harmful scales.²⁶⁹ If proactive measures are undertaken to this end, the creation of Botnets, and potentially their potency can be limited if and when States deploy Botnet mitigation measures as described in Mitigating or preventing Botnet-related harms.²⁷⁰ One way to limit the operation and spread of Botnets is to minimize and prevent the infection of devices.²⁷¹ There are primarily two methods through which contemporary Botnets can infect devices—first, by exploiting the vulnerabilities in the software, hardware or firmware used by the devices or second, by social engineering.²⁷²\n\nThe first method of propagation of malware can be limited first by regulating the suppliers of ICT products in requiring them to follow baseline security measures based on best practices.²⁷³ For this, States such as China, Japan, the United Kingdom, Germany, South Africa and Brazil have focused on technical standards, verification, certification or accreditation schemes.²⁷⁴ Moreover, similar to the harmonization of criminal provisions, there is a need for inter-State dialogue on global baseline security practice.²⁷⁵ This is because Botnets frequently infect devices across a tremendous number of States—for instance, the Mirai botnet infected Botnets in around 85 countries.²⁷⁶ States, particularly LDCs and developing States that do not have the\n\n²⁶³ ibid. 111.\n\n²⁶⁴ Coco, and de Souza Dias (n 30) Cyber due diligence in international law 137.\n\n²⁶⁵ Privacy International, 'Guide to International Law and Surveillance' (Privacy International, Dec 2021) <https: 2021%20gils%20version%203.0_0.pdf=\"\" default=\"\" files=\"\" sites=\"\" www.privacyinternational.org=\"\"> accessed 1 July 2022.\n\n²⁶⁶ Supra Sub-section on Factors Affecting Standard Of Conduct and Sub-section on Differential Capacities For Assessment Techniques.\n\n²⁶⁷ ITU (n 176) Global Cybersecurity Index 2020 vii.\n\n²⁶⁸ Supra Sub-section on Differential Capacities For Assessment Techniques.\n\n²⁶⁹ Ahmad (n 71) Why Botnets Persist: Designing Effective Technical and Policy Interventions, 26–27; Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 123.\n\n²⁷⁰ ibid.\n\n²⁷¹ ibid.\n\n²⁷² Ahmad (n 71) Why Botnets Persist: Designing Effective Technical and Policy Interventions, 26–27.\n\n²⁷³ ibid.; Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 123; ITU (n 243) Botnet Mitigation Toolkit.\n\n²⁷⁴ Coco, and de Souza Dias (n 30) Cyber due diligence in international law 181–186.\n\n²⁷⁵ ibid.\n\n²⁷⁶ Ahmad (n 71) Why Botnets Persist: Designing Effective Technical and Policy Interventions, 26–27.</https:>",

Infecting secured devices would require more investment, and if it is more than the expected financial return, the financial incentive for Botmasters to create Botnets at all could be curtailed.²⁷⁹\n\nTurning to the second manner in which Botnets generally propagate—social engineering—it is a method that involves manipulating the end users into committing errors for evading their device security. This is a psychological manipulation technique aiming to manoeuvre users into making security lapses, so as to gain unauthorised access to users' private information, devices, or valuables. However, this method too can be challenged by carrying out cybersecurity awareness campaigns that focus on building tech-literacy, particularly regarding the malware-spreading mechanisms and methods of social engineering.²⁸⁰ These campaigns should focus more on private companies as end-users, given that they have greater financial resources generally than individual end-users, and particularly small and medium enterprises which are more vulnerable.²⁸¹\n\nA capacity-building measure that would be common as a defense for both methods of Botnet propagation is conducting extensive cybersecurity awareness programs.²⁸² These programs require financial bandwidth to fund campaigns, and technical expertise since trained professionals are needed to spearhead them.²⁸³ Comprehensive public cybersecurity campaigns are arduous for developing and LDC countries. For instance, the ITU Cybersecurity Index revealed that more than half of the countries under examination did not have any cybersecurity educational programs or training for professionals.²⁸⁴ Similarly, a study of cybersecurity awareness for users and executives in Africa found that in the surveyed countries, the lack of such awareness was a major institutional deficiency, necessitating robust programs of this nature.²⁸⁵\n\n## Measures for early detection\n\nThe obligation of cyber capacity building toward creating a minimum institutional framework also aims at enabling States to detect threats that pose a risk of significant harm. In the case of Botnets, there is a need to create initiatives that focus on their 'early' detection.²⁸⁶ These can be worked upon by virtue of various mechanisms and initiatives, including some of the presently feasible ones we discuss hereafter.

The CIRTs should engage in information sharing with relevant stakeholders and actors who may have access to information about infections.²⁸⁸ This could include ISP, DNS, anti-virus companies, researchers and private companies facing the primary brunt of cybercrimes.²⁸⁹ However, we reiterate our caution from Differential capacities for assessment techniques in terms of how establishing a CIRT can require significant resources and LDCs particularly face many roadblocks and establishing such frameworks.²⁹⁰ The third mechanism for early detection is based on the cooperation between the State and DNS operators; this is limited to Botnets with command servers that use DNS-based communication protocol.²⁹¹ Here, the focus should be on mitigation efforts. For this, States could create a Botnet-related DNS abuse reputation system that identifies automatically and accurately the malicious domain before they appear on the blacklist.²⁹² However, all of the techniques discussed above would require the cooperation of private entities such as DNS operators and could be demanding for LDCs, especially if some developing States had to compel these private entities if they are non-cooperative, as elaborated in Section on Impact Assessment Obligations Around Botnets.²⁹³ Thus, these techniques may be accepted as good practices, rather than as an obligation for States to meet, especially as they, in any case, serve as illustrations of efforts that could not be alleged as below the due diligence standard.\n\n## Collaborative measures\n\nThroughout the article, we have seen how tackling the threat of Botnets requires cooperation and improved communication between relevant stakeholders since they may hold a distinct piece of the puzzle.²⁹⁴ As we have previously noted, Botnets are by their very nature transnational in scope, and due to their scale can often only be taken down by the cooperation not only between multiple States but also private parties which are involved in the takedown, such as antivirus companies, researchers, ISP and DNS providers and other tech companies.²⁹⁵ Impact assessment obligations around Botnets and Mitigating or preventing Botnet-related harms explain how conducting an impact assessment and taking mitigation or prevention measures necessitates a multi-stakeholder approach.²⁹⁶ A concomitant aim should be to build long-term and sustainable collaborations.²⁹⁷ Currently, private actors are not always given their due importance and inter-State cooperation on criminal matters is burdensome and slow as shown by contemporary mutual legal assistance processes.²⁹⁸ Consequently, there is a strong need to create\n\n²⁸⁷ Ahmad (n 71) Why Botnets Persist: Designing Effective Technical and Policy Interventions 27–29; Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 122.\n²⁸⁸ Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 121.\n²⁸⁹ ibid. 121, 95–102; Ahmad (n 71) Why Botnets Persist: Designing Effective Technical and Policy Interventions, 32–33.\n²⁹⁰ Supra Sub-section on Differential Capacities For Assessment Techniques.\n²⁹¹ Ahmad (n 71) Why Botnets Persist: Designing Effective Technical and Policy Interventions, 27–29.\n²⁹² ibid.; Shuang Hao, Nick Feamster, and Ramakant Pandrangi, 'Monitoring the initial DNS behavior of malicious domains' (IMC '11: Proceedings of the 2011 ACM SIGCOMM conference on Internet measurement conference, November 2011) <https: 2011=\"\" conf2011=\"\" docs=\"\" docx=\"\" p269.pdf=\"\" www.nytimes.com=\"\"> accessed 1 July 2022.\n²⁹³ Supra Sub-section on Differential Capacities For Assessment Techniques.\n²⁹⁴ Plohmann, Gerhards-Padilla, and Leder (n 11) Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence 121–23, 126–28.\n²⁹⁵ For instance, see, David E.

Third, the review should audit the adequacy of its overall cybersecurity infrastructure and efforts.³⁰³ Lastly, as the ITU recommends, the State can require entities both public and private to carry out an periodic cybersecurity audit that examines the information system’s security.³⁰⁴ This can focus on the physical configuration of the systems and software, information handling processes, user practices and environment.³⁰⁵ Again, all these suggestions must be treated as illustrations of good practices crucial for the maximal fruition of States’ due diligence obligations. We do not propose that these exact measures ought to necessarily be pursued as a matter of duty, especially given capacity differentials—however, these presently serve as some of the best possible examples of conduct the diligence of which could not reasonably be doubted. We are, therefore, hopeful for wider adoption of practices of this rigour.\n\n## CONCLUSION\n\nThrough this article, we have reaffirmed the increasing confidence in scholarly views for due diligence as a crucial means of regulating transboundary cyber operations. This faith was concretized through a unique legal and policy study of contemporary Botnets, which are among the gravest threats posed in cyberspace. That said, we demonstrated several cautions toward treating due diligence as a panacea against the Pandora’s box of harms opened by the advent of cyberspace, including for Botnets. This included evidentiary dilemmas that target States may face in proving violations of the norm, particularly given the differential standards of conduct expected of States based on their respective capacities—a nuance that we appreciated in relation to the context of the Botnet concerned, as also the State’s capacity against the specific Botnet concerned.\n\nYet, we also showed that many of these concerns apply to any international legal norm in the face of the novelties of this terrain. Further, due diligence connotes a spectrum of obligations for which target States may pursue the responsibility of a State of origin. This is from the very first stage of demanding that States conduct an impact assessment in the event of a preliminary\n\n²⁹⁹ Ahmad (n 71) Why Botnets Persist: Designing Effective Technical and Policy Interventions 27–29.\n³⁰⁰ Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 5.\n³⁰¹ Shackelford, Russell and Kuehn (n 84) ‘Unpacking the International Law on Cybersecurity Due Diligence: Lessons from the Public and Private Sectors 41–42.\n³⁰² Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm Article 3 paras [11].\n³⁰³ Shackelford, Russell and Kuehn (n 84) ‘Unpacking the International Law on Cybersecurity Due Diligence: Lessons from the Public and Private Sectors 41–42; ITU (n 176) Global Cybersecurity Index 2020 146.\n³⁰⁴ ITU (n 176) Global Cybersecurity Index 2020 141.\n³⁰⁵ ibid.",

To that end, we also unpacked the continuous obligation of all States toward cyber capacity building, to facilitate the discharge of their aforesaid obligations against Botnet-related harms. All in all, we submitted that the promise and benefits of due diligence are such as to empower meaningful cyber resilience against Botnets. This is not just until more specific treaties on the subject hopefully take shape—instead, there is merit in supporting the codification and concretization of the norm even in any such future instruments. Indeed, the capacity differentials in due diligence may hold great promise for developing States and LDCs, given its equitable logics.\n\nIn presenting our claims, we have been conscious of the definitional uncertainties that the articulation of due diligence has carried with respect to the 'Corfu Channel' and 'prevention of harm' principles, including in discourse around cyberspace. Yet we argued for a novel coherent conception of due diligence that unifies these principles, providing States and cybersecurity experts much-needed clarity in understanding the scope of its obligations and trigger-thresholds for complex threats such as Botnets. We also outlined various questions with respect to each specific sub-obligation under due diligence that necessitates urgent dialogue between States. In outlining the standards of conduct expected under due diligence, we exposited scientific literature concerning contemporary Botnets, as also several instances of good practices in this context. We are conscious that those illustrations may become anachronistic as technology advances. The point, however, was largely to demonstrate—unlike thus far seen in cyberspace literature—a concrete methodology and guidelines for States to appreciate the precise rigour of diligence that would be required of them against threats like Botnets. To that extent, it is safe to presume that the relevance of these contentions will remain foregrounded for a long time.\n\nWhile due diligence is indeed a strong legal device to facilitate international co-operation against Botnets, the opposite is equally true. Considering not least the sheer scale of contemporary transboundary Botnets, the fullest and meaningful actualization of due diligence in cyberspace is only possible with greater international co-operation between States and private actors alike, especially for cyber capacity building. Therefore, there remains an urgent need for robust co-operative and consultative efforts against Botnets and similar threats—which in the end, would only be to the collective benefit of the entire international community at large.\n\n## ACKNOWLEDGEMENT\n\nThe authors are grateful to Professor Aman for his guidance during their study of cyberspace, and to Professor Sanskriti Sanghi for her feedback and encouragement."

    "abstract": "The emergence of cyberspace has been followed by increasingly unpredictable threats to cybersecurity, including Botnets, which have been frequently exploited in cyber-criminal activities affecting dozens or hundreds of States at once. In existing scholarship, many reasons have informed growing support for the promise of 'due diligence' obligations in regulating transboundary cyber operations. We affirm this position through a study of the specific context of Botnets, although bringing much-needed caution and complexity to the discourse. We offer a comprehensive account of the standard of conduct expected of States in detecting, mitigating and preventing Botnet-linked harms under due diligence; as well as to pursue cyber capacity building toward discharging these obligations. In so doing, we problematize and elaborate on the nature of due diligence as an obligation of conduct, therefore accounting for differential State capacities against Botnet-linked harms. The paper involves attempts to unpack a coherent conception of due diligence, appreciating the spectrum of obligations that it demands, and demonstrating these nuances through an appraisal of good practices adopted by States and private actors against Botnets. Consequently, we provide a unique holistic account of how States and their law enforcement could practically understand the conduct expected of them when faced with transboundary Botnets on a case-to-case basis. In the end, while underscoring potential dilemmas within this legal regime that may be faced by target States, as also its unresolved questions, we submit that due diligence is indeed the most appropriate candidate to act as a legal arsenal against transboundary Botnets.
