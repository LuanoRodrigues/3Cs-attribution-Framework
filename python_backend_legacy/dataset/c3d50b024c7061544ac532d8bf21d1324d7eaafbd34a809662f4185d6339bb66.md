Introduction\nIncidences of cyberwars have substantially increased since 1990, turning cyberspace into a battlefield on which all nations must fight. Cyberattacks have been recognized as an international problem, and in 2018, this concern became a top global threat [1]. For many countries, cyberattacks and conflicts, and even the basic operation of cyberspace, are new concerns. In addition, because of the novelty of cyber in general, today's international law fails to adequately regulate cyberwarfare.\nTo discuss the management of the dilemma of cyberspace operations, cyberattack must be defined. Moreover, for States to use force in cyberwarfare, whether the right to use force exists under Article 51 of the United Nations (UN) Charter must be determined. To address these two concerns, whether cyberwarfare is under international law or domestic law must also be determined.\nThus, allowing a State to use force against cyberattacks should be justified under international law by assessing the aggressor State's responsibility. However, acknowledging any State's responsibility for a cyber intrusion has proven to be difficult, especially if the State depends on nonstate actors to launch a cyberattack against the victim State.\nIn this article, I analyze the aforementioned aspects of cyberattacks. In Part I, I conduct a comparison between a cyberattack as a domestic crime addressed under domestic laws and\nJournal of Financial Crime Vol. 31 No. 5, 2024 pp. 1052-1066 © Emerald Publishing Limited 1359-0790 DOI 10.1108/JFC-07-2023-0164\nas an international crime addressed under international laws. In Part II, I apply international law to cyberattacks. Finally, in Part III, I discuss committing cyberattacks by states and nonstate actors.\n## Cyberattacks as a domestic or international crime\nA principal challenge to managing cyberattacks is the difficulty of proving that the event occurred and if so, who perpetrated it. Today's internet is in a constant, intense state of major development and it is almost impossible to establish internet boundaries between countries or to prove any party or State committed a cyberattack. Thus, the challenge is to evaluate whether the perpetrator of the cyberattack is domestic, international or a combination of the two, to apply the applicable law and determine whether the attacks can be considered under the Law of War.\nThus, I first define the meaning of cyberattack and then observe the purpose and the results of this type of attack, committed by a State or nonstate actors and whether it is under the State's sovereignty or has crossed its borders.\n### Definition of cyberattacks\nThe main aim of a cyberattack is to destroy computer systems of companies, institutions, ministries and other important landmarks of a State and the main focus is on confidential information stored in computers. Stamatis Karnouskos described a cyberattack as follows: acts that usually originate from an unidentified source, individuals or organizations, to attack an operational system to withdraw information for purpose of stealing, destroying or altering a specified target by hacking into the susceptible system [2].\nNo clear definition of computer crimes has been provided because of its multiple categories, for example, the employment of computer network operations with the intent to deny adversaries the effective use of their computers, information systems and networks while ensuring the effective use of our own computers, information systems and networks. These operations include computer network attack, computer network exploration and computer network defense [3]. Thus, many institutions have attempted to define such crimes.\nStates have different definitions of cyberattack, for example, the USA, Russia and China. The US National Research Council defines individuals or organizations as “deliberate actions to alter, disrupt, deceive, degrade, or destroy computer systems or networks or the information and/or programs resident in or transiting these systems or networks” [4]. Notably, to avoid misunderstandings, ambiguity or gaps, this definition makes no distinction between cyberattacks and cybercrimes. By contrast, China and Russia's definition of a cyberattack focus on the free use of technology. The Shanghai Cooperation Organization [5] -- a political, economic and security alliance created by China, Russia, Iran, Indian, Pakistan and some of the former States of the Soviet Union -- defines a cyberattack as “mass psychological brainwashing to destabilize society and state, as well as to force the state to take decisions in the interest of an opposing party” [6].\nThe increasing number of cyberattacks and their effects on States have become top national security concerns and the UN has proposed a plan to help. The UN plan attempts to address the most urgent shortcomings in information security and define sustainable medium-term and long-term strategies for information security for the international community [7].\nThe European Union's (EU) definition of a cyberattack recognizes these events as a source of disruption, conflict and geopolitical rivalries and says that “deliberate activities to disrupt or destroy computer systems and networks. Cyber-deterrence refers to measures for\ndissuading potential perpetrators through robust systems, sanctions mechanisms and cyber-diplomacy” [8].\nThe literature has attempted to define a cyberattack. Junaidu Marshall and Muazu Saulawa defined a cyberattack as:“Deliberate exploitation of computer systems, technology-dependent enterprises and networks. Cyberattacks use malicious code to alter computer code, logic or data, resulting in disruptive consequences that can compromise data and lead to cybercrimes, such as information and identity theft [9].”Others [10] attempted to distinguish the purpose of a cyberattack by analyzing the motive, opportunity and methods used in the attack. All those factors affect the result of cyberattacks and hence indicate the applicable law, namely, domestic or international.\n### 2.2 Law applicable to cyberattacks\nThe legal definition of cyberwarfare and whether it is applicable under the current Law of War in international law or has another status that should be applied under domestic laws has not been determined. Thus, whether special international criminal law should be applied to cyberattacks and whether framing this type of attack through international treaties is appropriate ought to be determined. Currently, no comprehensive international treaty or convention exists to regulate cyberattacks [11]. Consequently, States have been using traditional methods to practice law, either by considering the event an international attack and responding to it under the Law of War or by acknowledging it as a criminal activity and prosecuting it under domestic criminal law.\nScholars such as Heather Dinniss, Francesca Spidalieri and Susan Brenner [12] have classified a cyberattack as a criminal act under domestic law for the following reasons: the difficulty of identifying the perpetrator and whether a State was the perpetrator; the uncertainty of whether a cyberattack can be legally considered an armed attack to which international law and the Law of War are applicable and whether the resulting damage or harm is similar to that caused by a traditional attack; and the right to use force for self-defense requires a physical attack by one State against another under the Law of War. Therefore, based on their reasons, applying domestic criminal law in cyberattack situations might be favorable.\nBy contrast, scholars such as Jeffery Carr, Louise Arimatsu and Joanna Kulesza [13] have classified cyberattacks under international law and Customary International Law (CIL). I support this perspective for several reasons. First, because attacking a State's infrastructure may cause as much harm and damage as an armed attack, applying domestic law would prevent the State from exercising its right of self-defense under international law, which is binding on other States. Second, applying domestic criminal law in such a case is ineffective because some States may refuse to extradite or prosecute the attackers under another State's law, which they (i.e. States and attackers) are not bound by. Third, organizing a cyberattack under international law would provide States legal cover when solving issues in international relations; by relying on the sovereign equality principle [14] between States, States can solve such issues in an equal, effective manner under the supervision of the international community, the UN and the Security Council.\nCyberattacks raise more challenges in enforcing the law because they are an unusual type of attack with an impact that may cross the border of a single State and may damage another State. Such cross-border damage may threaten international peace and security, violate the UN Charter and therefore transform into an international issue that should be\nInternational law enforcement\n1055\nresolved by international law rather than domestic law, which may not be binding on attackers from another State or raise the State's responsibility internationally.\nMoreover, although the classification of a cyberattack as an international attack rather than domestic attack can be based on responsibility, proving that the attack source was from another State either raises its responsibility before international law or the State will be responsible for the acts of the nonstate actors who initiated the attack from its territory because if the attackers acted within the State's borders to cause an attack, domestic criminal law is applicable because those attackers are criminals.\nTherefore, categorizing cyberattacks as domestic crimes would cause problems in applying protections to States' sovereignty in international law or in passive defense, which means preemptive protection of States, because States would have difficulty reducing the number of attacks launched from computers against its infrastructure by depending on a passive defense. Notably, a more efficient perspective is to consider a cyberattack an international crime because criminal law has been insufficiently effective at preventing cyberattacks, for example, some States, such as Russia and China, have not prosecuted their attackers for cybercrimes committed against other States, whether the attackers were located within their borders or attackers used by them [15].\n## 3. Implementation of international law on cyberattacks\nCyberattacks are a new form of conflict. The main purpose of cyberattacks is to undermine the functions of computers and to destroy their infrastructure and networks to disrupt the communications of, for example, a company or a country. To use force under Article 39 or Article 51 of the UN Charter, there must be a \"threat to international peace and security, breach of peace or act of aggression\". Accordingly, the question becomes whether a cyberattack is a breach of peace or an act of aggression. Thus, by understanding the definition of cyber (not actual or physical) attacks, the critical question is whether international law can regulate cyberwarfare. This question is, especially, relevant because no conventions on cyberwarfare have been established.\nA comparison between the effects of an armed attack and a cyberattack can be considered from many perspectives. First, by analyzing the \"instrument approach\" [16], which means if the instrument used in a cyberattack can cause damage similar to the damage caused by instruments used in a kinetic attack, a cyberattack can be characterized as an armed attack, which is an act of aggression that allows the use of force. Such an act would be, for instance, using the internet to blockade a city by shutting down its power grid, because in a kinetic case, the power grid would be bombed by using more kinetic means to cause the same result.\nSecond, analyzing the \"consequences\" of the attack [17] can occur when the results of a cyberattack can be similarly achieved by a kinetic attack, that is, the harm and damage to a State's sovereignty or its infrastructure would be the same in both cases. Consequently, the attack has achieved the core of aggression prohibited by international law. For instance, attacking the system that operates oil wells and preventing their operation would cause the same consequences as bombing the same system, because the result of shutting down oil distribution would be the same. For example, in 2012, Iran fomented a cyberattack against one of the largest oil companies in the world, Aramco, which is owned by Saudi Arabia, by releasing the Shamoon virus. This virus caused massive damage to more than 30,000 computers within Aramco's infrastructure, which destroyed operations and business proceedings for nearly two weeks [18] and caused Saudi Arabia to suffer substantial financial losses.\nJFC 31,5\n1056\nThird, an analysis would be conducted on the “direct liability” that may cause severe damage against the State’s infrastructure system in the same manner that may result from an armed attack, which raises the responsibility of the aggressor State [19].\nTherefore, to rely on international law to justify the use of countermeasures against a cyberattack, the damage or harm that the attack caused should be equal to that caused by a physical armed attack against which the victim State would respond to protect itself (i.e. the principle of self-defense) [20].\nInternational relations should be built on good faith and each nation should respect the internal affairs of other nations [21]. Otherwise, the aggressor State would be in violation of international law principles and would be attacking another State even if the attack was a cyberattack. A clear example of breaching the nonintervention principle occurred in 2007 when Russia perpetrated a cyberattack against Estonia, described as the most famous wide-range cyberattack. The duration of Russia’s cyberattack was three weeks and caused significant damage to Estonia’s electronics and telecommunication infrastructure. Apparently, the attack was in retaliation for the Estonian Government’s decision to remove a Russian monument from the center of an Estonian city, despite the threats from Russia. However, Russia’s international responsibility for committing this act of aggression against Estonia was never raised, because it was never acknowledged [22].\nAccordingly, a cyberattack can constitute an armed attack that causes the prohibited crime of aggression, raising the responsibility of the aggressor State and allowing the victim State to use force under Article 39 by gaining Security Council authorization.\n## 3.1 State responsibility cyberattacks\nThe concept of a State’s responsibility has been a base for international security, especially because many conflicts have arisen because of sovereignty issues. The question I attempt to answer in this section is what may raise a State’s responsibility for its actions? Due to violations of international law principles and another State’s sovereignty, the victim State may use legal measures to defend itself against any attack, cyber or kinetic, and such a matter obtains its legitimacy directly from Jus Cogen principles.\nThe speed of the growth of cyberattacks is making it difficult to track perpetrators, namely, nations and terrorists. Therefore, to raise a State’s responsibility, the attack must be proven to have been committed by the aggressor State. One of the difficulties in this matter is to prove who committed the cyberattack. In the early days of the internet, there was a unique IP address, an electronic address used to connect a user to the internet, which would indisputably identify the user to which it was assigned. Today, however, IP addresses are increasingly difficult to identify because users can now change their IP addresses and/or the location (e.g. country) in which the IP address is active. Thus, an agent located in State A can commit an attack against State B under an IP address from a State C, despite the agent’s location being State A.\nFor these reasons, the aggressor State must contribute to a cross-border cyberattack by allowing its agent to use passive measures to attack another State’s computer system to cause massive damage, which allows the victim State to use its right to defend itself against such an intrusion when the cyberattack is raised to the level of an armed attack. Thus, for those reasons, David Graham said:\nStates acting on the perceived legal requirement that they must conclusively attribute a cyberattack to another State or its agents historically have chosen to respond to cross-border cyberattacks as they would to criminal matters, employing only “passive” (computer security) measures to and urging the States from which the attacks originated to investigate and prosecute those responsible [23].\nJus ad bellum follows international law in its implementation and thus might also be applicable to cyber conflicts. Harold Koh stated that international law applies to cyberspace issues; however, each case should be considered individually because not all cases may justify the implementation of traditional law [24]. With the development of technology, international law should also be developed. New challenges and new cybertechnology should be considered, especially when relying on the CIL, where States start acting against new threats by creating new customary principles that reshape international law [25], to develop and govern the challenges and technology in this century, where the traditional Law of War is ineffective.\nThe international responsibility borne by a State for a wrongful act falls under jus in bello. The State is also responsible for the actions of agents under its direct control and in guiding them to attack other States [26], a rule adopted by the ICJ and the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia [27]. In other words, a State is responsible for implementing all measures to prevent individuals or groups from attacking other countries if they are acting solely without instruction from the State from which they are acting; otherwise, the State will have more responsibility for the attack. Thus, if a country takes all necessary measures to fight terrorist groups or hackers, it would be exempt from responsibility for a cyberattack perpetrated from within its borders against another (victim) State in the eyes of the international community and the victim State.\nIn supporting this concept, I must note that the idea of international responsibility does not apply to cyberattacks attributed to States only but also to nonstate actors (e.g. hackers and terrorists) who use the State's territory to attack another State.\n### 3.2 Nonstate actors' responsibility for a cyberattack\nTo establish such responsibility, I distinguish between cyberterrorism and cybercrime [28]. Cyberterrorism is committed by terrorists who use computer technology to apply their activities and are internationally motivated by political issues. Cybercrime is committed by hackers using internet technology to apply personal activities, such as manipulating a bank security system to steal money.\nDetermining the physical location to determine the responsibility of an attacker is normally a critical step to reliably establish his/her identity. Only by tracing the base computer where the virus was launched, its would be easy to identify the attacker and he/she can be verified; thus, tracking is possible. Often, however, this endeavor is not possible without the support of law enforcement agencies in the same State where the attacker launched the attack, which is less likely to occur in the case of a nation State-operated attack by its agents or supported hackers. For instance, breaking the chain of the network worm released at the Olympic Winter Games opening ceremony in Pyeongchang, South Korea, in 2018, was difficult. This malware was linked to other targeted attack groups known to have attacked other locations. These links led to confusion across the InfoSec industry in their attempts to assign attribution to the attacks because the attackers continually changed addresses and info flags [29].\nThe role of the State in adopting laws and imposing sanctions on these acts is notable. Many States, such as Kuwait, Jordan [30], the UAE [31], Germany [32], the UK [33] and the USA [34], have adopted cyber and electronic criminal law to prosecute such crimes and increase the punishments, to prevent hackers of nonstate actors from committing cybercrimes or attacks. For instance, Kuwaiti law prohibits unlawful access to a computer, its system, an electronic data processing system, an automated electronic system or an information network if this entry entails the abolition, deletion, destruction, disclosure,\nJFC 31,5\n1058\nalteration or republication of data or information [35]. This example demonstrates how States have attempted to add cybercrimes to their domestic laws.\nIn addition, even if the attacker is a nonstate actor, the victim State may invoke the principle of self-defense under the principles of law [36]. In other words, if a cyberattack causes damage that approaches the equivalence of damage caused by an armed attack, the principle of self-defense applies to the victim State. However, the victim State may not act in self-defense if the cyber attacker acted without the support of the country in which he/she resided (or from which he/she perpetrated the attack). Thus, proof must be provided that the host State collaborated with the cybercriminal to attack the victim country to permit it (the victim country) to raise the international responsibility to invoke the right of self-defense defined in the UN Charter [37].\nMany substantial modifications have been applied to assure a State's responsibility for the actions of nonstate actors. Notably, an opinion of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia in the Tadic case [38] states that the State will be held responsible for supporting, planning or assisting groups' actions against another State. Thus, as long as the proof of the connection between the two is clear, international responsibility is established. Moreover, this creates a criterion in international responsibility when shifting between effective control (the State's responsibility) to overall control (State and nonstate actors' responsibility), which allows in both cases for the victim State to use force to defend itself [39].\nHowever, States should not exceed the limit of self-defense even for nonstate actors. The September 11 attacks against the USA were a clear example of a State invoking the right to self-defense, even when extending the principles of necessity for such defense and the proportionality of the attack. The USA altered its counterterrorism laws to comply with international law when it encouraged the Security Council to adopt Resolution 1373 (2001) [40] on fighting terrorism because it threatens international peace and security. This resolution created normative content on the use of force against nonstate actors (terrorists) located in a sovereign State (in this case, Afghanistan). Moreover, the USA practiced its right of self-defense under international law against a terrorist group called Al-Qaeda in Afghanistan. Although the USA used force against the State of Afghanistan, its intent was to strike nonstate actors located inside the country in response to their attacks against the national security of the USA.\nThe USA, in its right of self-defense, did not follow the rules of a traditional attack, namely, one State against another; by contrast, the USA relied on the CIL and the Law of War to fight the attack by creating new criteria for using force when the attack is perpetrated by nonstate actors, which had not been regulated by traditional international law. Thus, law can be developed over years on the basis of facing new challenges and danger, and the exact example is applicable to today's challenges of cyberattacks, where it can be compared with nonstate actors' cases.\nIn summary, the raising of a State's responsibility for its nonstate actors resulted from its failure to comply with international law and its violation of international rules by allowing nonstate actors to act from its territory to attack another State; [41] compared with a cyberattack, the responsibility raises because the State failed to prevent continued attacks against States and to investigate and prosecute the attackers for their actions within its territory and, finally, when the State failed to implement international law.\n## 4. International attempts to regulate cyberattacks\nThe ICJ recognized in its decision in Nicaragua v. USA that the UN Charter provisions that restrict the use of force in international relations have become the CIL of jus ad bellum [42].\nThus, whether to categorize cyberattacks as a type of jus ad bellum and to create international instruments to govern cyberattacks become pertinent questions.\n## 4.1 Cybercrime Convention by the National Council of Europe\nThe Cybercrime Convention was adopted by the European Council in Budapest in 2001. This convention aimed to create \"criminal policy aimed at the protection of society against cybercrime [...] by adopting appropriate legislation and fostering international cooperation\" [43]. This convention was the first on cybercrimes and cyberattacks through network by collaborating the national laws together, encouraging investigations and increasing international cooperation.\nThe principle aims of the convention are as follows:\n- harmonize the domestic criminal substantive law elements of offenses and connected provisions in the area of cybercrime;\n- provide for the domestic criminal procedural law powers necessary for the investigation and prosecution of such offenses as well as other offenses committed by means of a computer system or evidence in relation to which is in electronic form; and\n- set up a fast, effective regime of international cooperation [44].\nThe convention is the product of four years of work by European and international experts and has been supplemented by an additional protocol that makes any publication of racist, xenophobic propaganda through computer networks a criminal offense, similar to Criminal Libel laws. Currently, cyberterrorism is also studied in the framework of the convention. [45].\n## 4.2 Global program on cybercrime by the United Nations\nThe complexity of the nature of cybercrimes and cyberattacks is from the increasing development of computer information and infrastructure, where perpetrators of those crimes are located worldwide and their crimes are crossing borders without an active international response.\nThe UN has attempted to thwart cyberattacks by adopting the UNGA Resolution 55/63. This resolution calls on Member States to prevent the criminal misuse of information technologies and acknowledge the value of inter alia. The following measures combat such misuse:\n- States should ensure that their laws and practices eliminate safe havens for individuals who criminally misuse information technologies.\n- Law enforcement cooperation in the investigation and prosecution of international cases of criminal misuse of information technologies should be coordinated among all concerned States.\n- Information should be exchanged between States regarding their problems in combating the criminal misuse of information technologies [46].\nSubsequently, the UNGA adopted Resolution 64/180 [47]. This resolution calls upon the UN Congress on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice to formulate solid suggestions for additional actions, drawing attention to practical arrangements to prevent organized crime and attacks, terrorism, corruption and technical assistance activities relating thereto and requests that the CCPCJ to work with the Economic and Social Council to achieve goals.\nInternational law enforcement\n1059\nMoreover, the UNGA adopted Resolution 65/230 [48], supporting the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Resolutions 22/7 and 22/8 [49], to assist Member States in their struggles and obstacles in preventing cyberattacks and to encourage cooperation in implementing international legal instruments pertaining to transnational organized cyberattacks.\nBroadly, cybercrime can be described as having cyber-dependent offenses, cyber-enabled offenses and, as a specific crime type, online international attacks. This program is designed to support Member States to prevent and combat cybercrime or international attacks against States in a holistic manner. The main geographic nexus for the Cybercrime Program in 2017 are Central America, Eastern Africa, MENA and East Asia and the Pacific, and the key aims are as follows: Increase efficiency and effectiveness in the investigation, prosecution and adjudication of cybercrime, especially online transnational cyberattacks or human rights abuse.Efficient and effective long-term whole-of-government responses to cybercrime, including national coordination, data collection and effective legal frameworks, leading to a sustainable response and greater deterrence.Strengthen national and international communication between governments, law enforcement and the private sector and increase public knowledge of cybercrime risks [50].\n### Tallinn Manual by NATO\nExperts at the NATO Cyber Center of Excellence have guided the center to adopt the Tallinn Manual [51], a manual that explains how to apply international law in cases of cyberattacks. This manual collects various CILs and fundamental laws, rules, doctrines and international principles that can govern the cyber conflicts of the international community. The Tallinn Manual highlights eight factors to consider in defining cyber operations: immediacy, presumptive legality, military factors, severity, invasiveness, directness, country involvement and measurability of effects [52]. The IGE, which authored the Tallinn Manual, considered the ICJ's opinions and decisions on the use of force and based the manual on historical materials that have shaped this concept. The Tallinn Manual also covers “hacktivist” groups and a State's responsibility for an attack if such groups use it as a safe haven or if hacktivists are being protected by the State's intelligence agencies or officials [53].\nThe Tallinn Manual aims to set clear standards on situations involving cyber conflicts. For instance, the Tallinn Manual discusses the destruction and physical harm that can result from a cyberattack. According to Rule 13 of the Tallinn Manual [54], destruction or causalities caused by a cyberattack may elevate the attack to a level considered a “use of force”, which is prohibited by international law and the UN Charter [55]. Even if the attacker is a nonstate actor, the victim State may invoke the principle of self-defense under the principles of law, as stated previously [56].\nThus, I suggest that the Tallinn Manual fills the gaps in the international law on cyber conflicts. In general practice, parties refer first to international law and then rely on the Tallinn Manual to interpret the application of law in each case; [57] however, the Tallinn Manual has no jurisdiction over States outside the EU; thus, it creates an international instrument only applicable to cases of cyber. The Tallinn Manual summarizes a State's responsibility if a cyberattack causes a breach in international legal obligations; raises this\npoint, based on the principles of the CIL; [58] and recognizes the responsibility of the agent/s responsible for cyber intrusion into another State. These aspects could lead to prosecution, for example, in the normal exercise of international laws and rules, either by the ICC or by domestic courts.\nNotably, the Tallinn Manual suggests that the term “armed” does not require the existence of weapons; however, it does stipulate that the factors of scale and affect are required to justify the victim State applying the use of force in its self-defense efforts [59]. Eliminating the physical element (i.e. weapons) of the definition of armed means that broadening the interpretation of the term “use of force” would make the application of international laws easier in cases of cyberattacks.\n## 5. Conclusion\nThe frequency of cyberattacks and major information leaks have been increasing annually and attackers use complex ideas, tools and techniques and, in some cases, have received State support. Some attacks affect critical infrastructure and cause major destruction; thus, they pose risks to human lives and create unprecedented data leaks of confidential and classified information that cause mass disorder. The ability to attribute such attacks to States, groups or individuals can have a critical deterrent effect. Reliable identification of the attacker's origin prevents additional attacks from occurring, even if it raises a State's responsibility. This reason is an explanation of why nation-states are highly interested in the attribution of cyberattacks.\nTraditional international law and its provisions for attacks against territorial principles do not cover cyberattacks. Because the internet and cyberspace have neither boundaries nor limits, determining the laws to apply to cyber attackers is difficult. The matter of cyber conflicts raises the issues of aggressor nations, nonstate actors, international responsibility and the principle of self-defense.\nToday, implementing only traditional international law in cases of cyberwarfare is insufficient and the international community must adopt law that regulates and governs cyberspace and cyber conflicts. In addition, clear criteria should apply internationally to develop the CIL to manage the cyber challenges of the 21st century. Recognizing this necessity, some States have adopted measures and binding laws that regulate and categorize cyber conflicts. In many cases, these provisions grant the victim State the right to protect itself against any attack; however, those regulations remain nonbinding, unless an international governance treaty is created in the international community.\nIn conclusion, I have proposed several recommendations that acknowledge the importance of framing the legal instruments of cyberattacks, for example:\n- Countries should strengthen their cyber laws and cooperate with the international community to fight and establish a legal framework to combat cyberattacks.\n- The continual advancements in the methods used to wage the endemic threat of cyberattacks lead governments to continue to attempt to prevent all types of misuse of computer information and set protections on the internet.\n- Valarie Mac Niven recommends the following: expand the power of domestic law internationally, develop a system to use limited countermeasures where appropriate and apply effective enforcement of cyber laws [60].\n- No consensus exists on the definition of a cyberattack; thus, the international community or the UN must adopt a binding treaty similar to the Tallinn Manual to legally regulate this crime and punish perpetrators of transnational cybercrimes against States.\nJFC 31,5\n1062",

Introduction Incidences of cyberwars have substantially increased since 1990, turning cyberspace into a battlefield on which all nations must fight. Cyberattacks have been recognized as an international problem, and in 2018, this concern became a top global threat [1]. For many countries, cyberattacks and conflicts, and even the basic operation of cyberspace, are new concerns. In addition, because of the novelty of cyber in general, today's international law fails to adequately regulate cyberwarfare.\nTo discuss the management of the dilemma of cyberspace operations, cyberattack must be defined. Moreover, for States to use force in cyberwarfare, whether the right to use force exists under Article 51 of the United Nations (UN) Charter must be determined. To address these two concerns, whether cyberwarfare is under international law or domestic law must also be determined.\nThus, allowing a State to use force against cyberattacks should be justified under international law by assessing the aggressor State's responsibility. However, acknowledging any State's responsibility for a cyber intrusion has proven to be difficult, especially if the State depends on nonstate actors to launch a cyberattack against the victim State.\nIn this article, I analyze the aforementioned aspects of cyberattacks. In Part I, I conduct a comparison between a cyberattack as a domestic crime addressed under domestic laws and Journal of Financial Crime Vol. 31 No. 5, 2024 pp. 1052-1066 © Emerald Publishing Limited 1359-0790 DOI 10.1108/JFC-07-2023-0164 as an international crime addressed under international laws. In Part II, I apply international law to cyberattacks. Finally, in Part III, I discuss committing cyberattacks by states and nonstate actors.\n## Cyberattacks as a domestic or international crime A principal challenge to managing cyberattacks is the difficulty of proving that the event occurred and if so, who perpetrated it. Today's internet is in a constant, intense state of major development and it is almost impossible to establish internet boundaries between countries or to prove any party or State committed a cyberattack. Thus, the challenge is to evaluate whether the perpetrator of the cyberattack is domestic, international or a combination of the two, to apply the applicable law and determine whether the attacks can be considered under the Law of War.\nThus, I first define the meaning of cyberattack and then observe the purpose and the results of this type of attack, committed by a State or nonstate actors and whether it is under the State's sovereignty or has crossed its borders.\n### Definition of cyberattacks The main aim of a cyberattack is to destroy computer systems of companies, institutions, ministries and other important landmarks of a State and the main focus is on confidential information stored in computers. Stamatis Karnouskos described a cyberattack as follows: acts that usually originate from an unidentified source, individuals or organizations, to attack an operational system to withdraw information for purpose of stealing, destroying or altering a specified target by hacking into the susceptible system [2].\nNo clear definition of computer crimes has been provided because of its multiple categories, for example, the employment of computer network operations with the intent to deny adversaries the effective use of their computers, information systems and networks while ensuring the effective use of our own computers, information systems and networks. These operations include computer network attack, computer network exploration and computer network defense [3]. Thus, many institutions have attempted to define such crimes.\nStates have different definitions of cyberattack, for example, the USA, Russia and China. The US National Research Council defines individuals or organizations as “deliberate actions to alter, disrupt, deceive, degrade, or destroy computer systems or networks or the information and/or programs resident in or transiting these systems or networks” [4]. Notably, to avoid misunderstandings, ambiguity or gaps, this definition makes no distinction between cyberattacks and cybercrimes. By contrast, China and Russia's definition of a cyberattack focus on the free use of technology. The Shanghai Cooperation Organization [5] -- a political, economic and security alliance created by China, Russia, Iran, Indian, Pakistan and some of the former States of the Soviet Union -- defines a cyberattack as “mass psychological brainwashing to destabilize society and state, as well as to force the state to take decisions in the interest of an opposing party” [6].\nThe increasing number of cyberattacks and their effects on States have become top national security concerns and the UN has proposed a plan to help. The UN plan attempts to address the most urgent shortcomings in information security and define sustainable medium-term and long-term strategies for information security for the international community [7].\nThe European Union's (EU) definition of a cyberattack recognizes these events as a source of disruption, conflict and geopolitical rivalries and says that “deliberate activities to disrupt or destroy computer systems and networks. Cyber-deterrence refers to measures for dissuading potential perpetrators through robust systems, sanctions mechanisms and cyber-diplomacy” [8].\nThe literature has attempted to define a cyberattack. Junaidu Marshall and Muazu Saulawa defined a cyberattack as:“Deliberate exploitation of computer systems, technology-dependent enterprises and networks. Cyberattacks use malicious code to alter computer code, logic or data, resulting in disruptive consequences that can compromise data and lead to cybercrimes, such as information and identity theft [9].”Others [10] attempted to distinguish the purpose of a cyberattack by analyzing the motive, opportunity and methods used in the attack. All those factors affect the result of cyberattacks and hence indicate the applicable law, namely, domestic or international.\n### 2.2 Law applicable to cyberattacks The legal definition of cyberwarfare and whether it is applicable under the current Law of War in international law or has another status that should be applied under domestic laws has not been determined. Thus, whether special international criminal law should be applied to cyberattacks and whether framing this type of attack through international treaties is appropriate ought to be determined. Currently, no comprehensive international treaty or convention exists to regulate cyberattacks [11]. Consequently, States have been using traditional methods to practice law, either by considering the event an international attack and responding to it under the Law of War or by acknowledging it as a criminal activity and prosecuting it under domestic criminal law.\nScholars such as Heather Dinniss, Francesca Spidalieri and Susan Brenner [12] have classified a cyberattack as a criminal act under domestic law for the following reasons: the difficulty of identifying the perpetrator and whether a State was the perpetrator; the uncertainty of whether a cyberattack can be legally considered an armed attack to which international law and the Law of War are applicable and whether the resulting damage or harm is similar to that caused by a traditional attack; and the right to use force for self-defense requires a physical attack by one State against another under the Law of War. Therefore, based on their reasons, applying domestic criminal law in cyberattack situations might be favorable.\nBy contrast, scholars such as Jeffery Carr, Louise Arimatsu and Joanna Kulesza [13] have classified cyberattacks under international law and Customary International Law (CIL). I support this perspective for several reasons. First, because attacking a State's infrastructure may cause as much harm and damage as an armed attack, applying domestic law would prevent the State from exercising its right of self-defense under international law, which is binding on other States. Second, applying domestic criminal law in such a case is ineffective because some States may refuse to extradite or prosecute the attackers under another State's law, which they (i.e. States and attackers) are not bound by. Third, organizing a cyberattack under international law would provide States legal cover when solving issues in international relations; by relying on the sovereign equality principle [14] between States, States can solve such issues in an equal, effective manner under the supervision of the international community, the UN and the Security Council.\nCyberattacks raise more challenges in enforcing the law because they are an unusual type of attack with an impact that may cross the border of a single State and may damage another State. Such cross-border damage may threaten international peace and security, violate the UN Charter and therefore transform into an international issue that should be International law enforcement Moreover, although the classification of a cyberattack as an international attack rather than domestic attack can be based on responsibility, proving that the attack source was from another State either raises its responsibility before international law or the State will be responsible for the acts of the nonstate actors who initiated the attack from its territory because if the attackers acted within the State's borders to cause an attack, domestic criminal law is applicable because those attackers are criminals.\nTherefore, categorizing cyberattacks as domestic crimes would cause problems in applying protections to States' sovereignty in international law or in passive defense, which means preemptive protection of States, because States would have difficulty reducing the number of attacks launched from computers against its infrastructure by depending on a passive defense. Notably, a more efficient perspective is to consider a cyberattack an international crime because criminal law has been insufficiently effective at preventing cyberattacks, for example, some States, such as Russia and China, have not prosecuted their attackers for cybercrimes committed against other States, whether the attackers were located within their borders or attackers used by them [15].\n## 3. Implementation of international law on cyberattacks Cyberattacks are a new form of conflict. The main purpose of cyberattacks is to undermine the functions of computers and to destroy their infrastructure and networks to disrupt the communications of, for example, a company or a country. To use force under Article 39 or Article 51 of the UN Charter, there must be a\"threat to international peace and security, breach of peace or act of aggression\". Accordingly, the question becomes whether a cyberattack is a breach of peace or an act of aggression. Thus, by understanding the definition of cyber (not actual or physical) attacks, the critical question is whether international law can regulate cyberwarfare. This question is, especially, relevant because no conventions on cyberwarfare have been established.\nA comparison between the effects of an armed attack and a cyberattack can be considered from many perspectives. First, by analyzing the\"instrument approach\"[16], which means if the instrument used in a cyberattack can cause damage similar to the damage caused by instruments used in a kinetic attack, a cyberattack can be characterized as an armed attack, which is an act of aggression that allows the use of force. Such an act would be, for instance, using the internet to blockade a city by shutting down its power grid, because in a kinetic case, the power grid would be bombed by using more kinetic means to cause the same result.\nSecond, analyzing the\"consequences\"of the attack [17] can occur when the results of a cyberattack can be similarly achieved by a kinetic attack, that is, the harm and damage to a State's sovereignty or its infrastructure would be the same in both cases. Consequently, the attack has achieved the core of aggression prohibited by international law. For instance, attacking the system that operates oil wells and preventing their operation would cause the same consequences as bombing the same system, because the result of shutting down oil distribution would be the same. For example, in 2012, Iran fomented a cyberattack against one of the largest oil companies in the world, Aramco, which is owned by Saudi Arabia, by releasing the Shamoon virus. This virus caused massive damage to more than 30,000 computers within Aramco's infrastructure, which destroyed operations and business proceedings for nearly two weeks [18] and caused Saudi Arabia to suffer substantial financial losses.\nJFC 31,5 Therefore, to rely on international law to justify the use of countermeasures against a cyberattack, the damage or harm that the attack caused should be equal to that caused by a physical armed attack against which the victim State would respond to protect itself (i.e. the principle of self-defense) [20].\nInternational relations should be built on good faith and each nation should respect the internal affairs of other nations [21]. Otherwise, the aggressor State would be in violation of international law principles and would be attacking another State even if the attack was a cyberattack. A clear example of breaching the nonintervention principle occurred in 2007 when Russia perpetrated a cyberattack against Estonia, described as the most famous wide-range cyberattack. The duration of Russia’s cyberattack was three weeks and caused significant damage to Estonia’s electronics and telecommunication infrastructure. Apparently, the attack was in retaliation for the Estonian Government’s decision to remove a Russian monument from the center of an Estonian city, despite the threats from Russia. However, Russia’s international responsibility for committing this act of aggression against Estonia was never raised, because it was never acknowledged [22].\nAccordingly, a cyberattack can constitute an armed attack that causes the prohibited crime of aggression, raising the responsibility of the aggressor State and allowing the victim State to use force under Article 39 by gaining Security Council authorization.\n## 3.1 State responsibility cyberattacks The concept of a State’s responsibility has been a base for international security, especially because many conflicts have arisen because of sovereignty issues. The question I attempt to answer in this section is what may raise a State’s responsibility for its actions? Due to violations of international law principles and another State’s sovereignty, the victim State may use legal measures to defend itself against any attack, cyber or kinetic, and such a matter obtains its legitimacy directly from Jus Cogen principles.\nThe speed of the growth of cyberattacks is making it difficult to track perpetrators, namely, nations and terrorists. Therefore, to raise a State’s responsibility, the attack must be proven to have been committed by the aggressor State. One of the difficulties in this matter is to prove who committed the cyberattack. In the early days of the internet, there was a unique IP address, an electronic address used to connect a user to the internet, which would indisputably identify the user to which it was assigned. Today, however, IP addresses are increasingly difficult to identify because users can now change their IP addresses and/or the location (e.g. country) in which the IP address is active. Thus, an agent located in State A can commit an attack against State B under an IP address from a State C, despite the agent’s location being State A.\nFor these reasons, the aggressor State must contribute to a cross-border cyberattack by allowing its agent to use passive measures to attack another State’s computer system to cause massive damage, which allows the victim State to use its right to defend itself against such an intrusion when the cyberattack is raised to the level of an armed attack. Thus, for those reasons, David Graham said: States acting on the perceived legal requirement that they must conclusively attribute a cyberattack to another State or its agents historically have chosen to respond to cross-border cyberattacks as they would to criminal matters, employing only “passive” (computer security) measures to and urging the States from which the attacks originated to investigate and prosecute those responsible [23].\nJus ad bellum follows international law in its implementation and thus might also be applicable to cyber conflicts. Harold Koh stated that international law applies to cyberspace issues; however, each case should be considered individually because not all cases may justify the implementation of traditional law [24]. With the development of technology, international law should also be developed. New challenges and new cybertechnology should be considered, especially when relying on the CIL, where States start acting against new threats by creating new customary principles that reshape international law [25], to develop and govern the challenges and technology in this century, where the traditional Law of War is ineffective.\nThe international responsibility borne by a State for a wrongful act falls under jus in bello. The State is also responsible for the actions of agents under its direct control and in guiding them to attack other States [26], a rule adopted by the ICJ and the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia [27]. In other words, a State is responsible for implementing all measures to prevent individuals or groups from attacking other countries if they are acting solely without instruction from the State from which they are acting; otherwise, the State will have more responsibility for the attack. Thus, if a country takes all necessary measures to fight terrorist groups or hackers, it would be exempt from responsibility for a cyberattack perpetrated from within its borders against another (victim) State in the eyes of the international community and the victim State.\nIn supporting this concept, I must note that the idea of international responsibility does not apply to cyberattacks attributed to States only but also to nonstate actors (e.g. hackers and terrorists) who use the State's territory to attack another State.\n### 3.2 Nonstate actors' responsibility for a cyberattack To establish such responsibility, I distinguish between cyberterrorism and cybercrime [28]. Cyberterrorism is committed by terrorists who use computer technology to apply their activities and are internationally motivated by political issues. Cybercrime is committed by hackers using internet technology to apply personal activities, such as manipulating a bank security system to steal money.\nDetermining the physical location to determine the responsibility of an attacker is normally a critical step to reliably establish his/her identity. Only by tracing the base computer where the virus was launched, its would be easy to identify the attacker and he/she can be verified; thus, tracking is possible. Often, however, this endeavor is not possible without the support of law enforcement agencies in the same State where the attacker launched the attack, which is less likely to occur in the case of a nation State-operated attack by its agents or supported hackers. For instance, breaking the chain of the network worm released at the Olympic Winter Games opening ceremony in Pyeongchang, South Korea, in 2018, was difficult. This malware was linked to other targeted attack groups known to have attacked other locations. These links led to confusion across the InfoSec industry in their attempts to assign attribution to the attacks because the attackers continually changed addresses and info flags [29].\nThe role of the State in adopting laws and imposing sanctions on these acts is notable. Many States, such as Kuwait, Jordan [30], the UAE [31], Germany [32], the UK [33] and the USA [34], have adopted cyber and electronic criminal law to prosecute such crimes and increase the punishments, to prevent hackers of nonstate actors from committing cybercrimes or attacks. For instance, Kuwaiti law prohibits unlawful access to a computer, its system, an electronic data processing system, an automated electronic system or an information network if this entry entails the abolition, deletion, destruction, disclosure, JFC 31,5 In addition, even if the attacker is a nonstate actor, the victim State may invoke the principle of self-defense under the principles of law [36]. In other words, if a cyberattack causes damage that approaches the equivalence of damage caused by an armed attack, the principle of self-defense applies to the victim State. However, the victim State may not act in self-defense if the cyber attacker acted without the support of the country in which he/she resided (or from which he/she perpetrated the attack). Thus, proof must be provided that the host State collaborated with the cybercriminal to attack the victim country to permit it (the victim country) to raise the international responsibility to invoke the right of self-defense defined in the UN Charter [37].\nMany substantial modifications have been applied to assure a State's responsibility for the actions of nonstate actors. Notably, an opinion of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia in the Tadic case [38] states that the State will be held responsible for supporting, planning or assisting groups' actions against another State. Thus, as long as the proof of the connection between the two is clear, international responsibility is established. Moreover, this creates a criterion in international responsibility when shifting between effective control (the State's responsibility) to overall control (State and nonstate actors' responsibility), which allows in both cases for the victim State to use force to defend itself [39].\nHowever, States should not exceed the limit of self-defense even for nonstate actors. The September 11 attacks against the USA were a clear example of a State invoking the right to self-defense, even when extending the principles of necessity for such defense and the proportionality of the attack. The USA altered its counterterrorism laws to comply with international law when it encouraged the Security Council to adopt Resolution 1373 (2001) [40] on fighting terrorism because it threatens international peace and security. This resolution created normative content on the use of force against nonstate actors (terrorists) located in a sovereign State (in this case, Afghanistan). Moreover, the USA practiced its right of self-defense under international law against a terrorist group called Al-Qaeda in Afghanistan. Although the USA used force against the State of Afghanistan, its intent was to strike nonstate actors located inside the country in response to their attacks against the national security of the USA.\nThe USA, in its right of self-defense, did not follow the rules of a traditional attack, namely, one State against another; by contrast, the USA relied on the CIL and the Law of War to fight the attack by creating new criteria for using force when the attack is perpetrated by nonstate actors, which had not been regulated by traditional international law. Thus, law can be developed over years on the basis of facing new challenges and danger, and the exact example is applicable to today's challenges of cyberattacks, where it can be compared with nonstate actors' cases.\nIn summary, the raising of a State's responsibility for its nonstate actors resulted from its failure to comply with international law and its violation of international rules by allowing nonstate actors to act from its territory to attack another State; [41] compared with a cyberattack, the responsibility raises because the State failed to prevent continued attacks against States and to investigate and prosecute the attackers for their actions within its territory and, finally, when the State failed to implement international law.\n## 4. International attempts to regulate cyberattacks The ICJ recognized in its decision in Nicaragua v. USA that the UN Charter provisions that restrict the use of force in international relations have become the CIL of jus ad bellum [42].\nThus, whether to categorize cyberattacks as a type of jus ad bellum and to create international instruments to govern cyberattacks become pertinent questions.\n## 4.1 Cybercrime Convention by the National Council of Europe The Cybercrime Convention was adopted by the European Council in Budapest in 2001. This convention aimed to create\"criminal policy aimed at the protection of society against cybercrime [...] by adopting appropriate legislation and fostering international cooperation\"[43]. This convention was the first on cybercrimes and cyberattacks through network by collaborating the national laws together, encouraging investigations and increasing international cooperation.\nThe principle aims of the convention are as follows: - harmonize the domestic criminal substantive law elements of offenses and connected provisions in the area of cybercrime; - provide for the domestic criminal procedural law powers necessary for the investigation and prosecution of such offenses as well as other offenses committed by means of a computer system or evidence in relation to which is in electronic form; and - set up a fast, effective regime of international cooperation [44].\nThe convention is the product of four years of work by European and international experts and has been supplemented by an additional protocol that makes any publication of racist, xenophobic propaganda through computer networks a criminal offense, similar to Criminal Libel laws. Currently, cyberterrorism is also studied in the framework of the convention. [45].\n## 4.2 Global program on cybercrime by the United Nations The complexity of the nature of cybercrimes and cyberattacks is from the increasing development of computer information and infrastructure, where perpetrators of those crimes are located worldwide and their crimes are crossing borders without an active international response.\nThe UN has attempted to thwart cyberattacks by adopting the UNGA Resolution 55/63. This resolution calls on Member States to prevent the criminal misuse of information technologies and acknowledge the value of inter alia. The following measures combat such misuse: - States should ensure that their laws and practices eliminate safe havens for individuals who criminally misuse information technologies.\n- Law enforcement cooperation in the investigation and prosecution of international cases of criminal misuse of information technologies should be coordinated among all concerned States.\n- Information should be exchanged between States regarding their problems in combating the criminal misuse of information technologies [46].\nSubsequently, the UNGA adopted Resolution 64/180 [47]. This resolution calls upon the UN Congress on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice to formulate solid suggestions for additional actions, drawing attention to practical arrangements to prevent organized crime and attacks, terrorism, corruption and technical assistance activities relating thereto and requests that the CCPCJ to work with the Economic and Social Council to achieve goals.\nInternational law enforcement Broadly, cybercrime can be described as having cyber-dependent offenses, cyber-enabled offenses and, as a specific crime type, online international attacks. This program is designed to support Member States to prevent and combat cybercrime or international attacks against States in a holistic manner. The main geographic nexus for the Cybercrime Program in 2017 are Central America, Eastern Africa, MENA and East Asia and the Pacific, and the key aims are as follows: Increase efficiency and effectiveness in the investigation, prosecution and adjudication of cybercrime, especially online transnational cyberattacks or human rights abuse.Efficient and effective long-term whole-of-government responses to cybercrime, including national coordination, data collection and effective legal frameworks, leading to a sustainable response and greater deterrence.Strengthen national and international communication between governments, law enforcement and the private sector and increase public knowledge of cybercrime risks [50].\n### Tallinn Manual by NATO Experts at the NATO Cyber Center of Excellence have guided the center to adopt the Tallinn Manual [51], a manual that explains how to apply international law in cases of cyberattacks. This manual collects various CILs and fundamental laws, rules, doctrines and international principles that can govern the cyber conflicts of the international community. The Tallinn Manual highlights eight factors to consider in defining cyber operations: immediacy, presumptive legality, military factors, severity, invasiveness, directness, country involvement and measurability of effects [52]. The IGE, which authored the Tallinn Manual, considered the ICJ's opinions and decisions on the use of force and based the manual on historical materials that have shaped this concept. The Tallinn Manual also covers “hacktivist” groups and a State's responsibility for an attack if such groups use it as a safe haven or if hacktivists are being protected by the State's intelligence agencies or officials [53].\nThe Tallinn Manual aims to set clear standards on situations involving cyber conflicts. For instance, the Tallinn Manual discusses the destruction and physical harm that can result from a cyberattack. According to Rule 13 of the Tallinn Manual [54], destruction or causalities caused by a cyberattack may elevate the attack to a level considered a “use of force”, which is prohibited by international law and the UN Charter [55]. Even if the attacker is a nonstate actor, the victim State may invoke the principle of self-defense under the principles of law, as stated previously [56].\nThus, I suggest that the Tallinn Manual fills the gaps in the international law on cyber conflicts. In general practice, parties refer first to international law and then rely on the Tallinn Manual to interpret the application of law in each case; [57] however, the Tallinn Manual has no jurisdiction over States outside the EU; thus, it creates an international instrument only applicable to cases of cyber. The Tallinn Manual summarizes a State's responsibility if a cyberattack causes a breach in international legal obligations; raises this point, based on the principles of the CIL; [58] and recognizes the responsibility of the agent/s responsible for cyber intrusion into another State. These aspects could lead to prosecution, for example, in the normal exercise of international laws and rules, either by the ICC or by domestic courts.\nNotably, the Tallinn Manual suggests that the term “armed” does not require the existence of weapons; however, it does stipulate that the factors of scale and affect are required to justify the victim State applying the use of force in its self-defense efforts [59]. Eliminating the physical element (i.e. weapons) of the definition of armed means that broadening the interpretation of the term “use of force” would make the application of international laws easier in cases of cyberattacks.\n## 5. Conclusion The frequency of cyberattacks and major information leaks have been increasing annually and attackers use complex ideas, tools and techniques and, in some cases, have received State support. Some attacks affect critical infrastructure and cause major destruction; thus, they pose risks to human lives and create unprecedented data leaks of confidential and classified information that cause mass disorder. The ability to attribute such attacks to States, groups or individuals can have a critical deterrent effect. Reliable identification of the attacker's origin prevents additional attacks from occurring, even if it raises a State's responsibility. This reason is an explanation of why nation-states are highly interested in the attribution of cyberattacks.\nTraditional international law and its provisions for attacks against territorial principles do not cover cyberattacks. Because the internet and cyberspace have neither boundaries nor limits, determining the laws to apply to cyber attackers is difficult. The matter of cyber conflicts raises the issues of aggressor nations, nonstate actors, international responsibility and the principle of self-defense.\nToday, implementing only traditional international law in cases of cyberwarfare is insufficient and the international community must adopt law that regulates and governs cyberspace and cyber conflicts. In addition, clear criteria should apply internationally to develop the CIL to manage the cyber challenges of the 21st century. Recognizing this necessity, some States have adopted measures and binding laws that regulate and categorize cyber conflicts. In many cases, these provisions grant the victim State the right to protect itself against any attack; however, those regulations remain nonbinding, unless an international governance treaty is created in the international community.\nIn conclusion, I have proposed several recommendations that acknowledge the importance of framing the legal instruments of cyberattacks, for example: - Countries should strengthen their cyber laws and cooperate with the international community to fight and establish a legal framework to combat cyberattacks.\n- The continual advancements in the methods used to wage the endemic threat of cyberattacks lead governments to continue to attempt to prevent all types of misuse of computer information and set protections on the internet.\n- Valarie Mac Niven recommends the following: expand the power of domestic law internationally, develop a system to use limited countermeasures where appropriate and apply effective enforcement of cyber laws [60].\n- No consensus exists on the definition of a cyberattack; thus, the international community or the UN must adopt a binding treaty similar to the Tallinn Manual to legally regulate this crime and punish perpetrators of transnational cybercrimes against States.\nJFC 31,5 1062",

    "# 1. Introduction": "Incidences of cyberwars have substantially increased since 1990, turning cyberspace into a battlefield on which all nations must fight. Cyberattacks have been recognized as an international problem, and in 2018, this concern became a top global threat . For many countries, cyberattacks and conflicts, and even the basic operation of cyberspace, are new concerns. In addition, because of the novelty of cyber in general, today's international law fails to adequately regulate cyberwarfare.\nTo discuss the management of the dilemma of cyberspace operations, cyberattack must be defined. Moreover, for States to use force in cyberwarfare, whether the right to use force exists under Article 51 of the United Nations (UN) Charter must be determined. To address these two concerns, whether cyberwarfare is under international law or domestic law must also be determined.\nThus, allowing a State to use force against cyberattacks should be justified under international law by assessing the aggressor State's responsibility. However, acknowledging any State's responsibility for a cyber intrusion has proven to be difficult, especially if the State depends on nonstate actors to launch a cyberattack against the victim State.\nIn this article, I analyze the aforementioned aspects of cyberattacks. In Part I, I conduct a comparison between a cyberattack as a domestic crime addressed under domestic laws and\nJournal of Financial Crime Vol. 31 No. 5, 2024 pp. 1052-1066 © Emerald Publishing Limited 1359-0790 DOI 10.1108/JFC-07-2023-0164\nas an international crime addressed under international laws. In Part II, I apply international law to cyberattacks. Finally, in Part III, I discuss committing cyberattacks by states and nonstate actors.\n## Cyberattacks as a domestic or international crime\nA principal challenge to managing cyberattacks is the difficulty of proving that the event occurred and if so, who perpetrated it. Today's internet is in a constant, intense state of major development and it is almost impossible to establish internet boundaries between countries or to prove any party or State committed a cyberattack. Thus, the challenge is to evaluate whether the perpetrator of the cyberattack is domestic, international or a combination of the two, to apply the applicable law and determine whether the attacks can be considered under the Law of War.\nThus, I first define the meaning of cyberattack and then observe the purpose and the results of this type of attack, committed by a State or nonstate actors and whether it is under the State's sovereignty or has crossed its borders.\n### Definition of cyberattacks\nThe main aim of a cyberattack is to destroy computer systems of companies, institutions, ministries and other important landmarks of a State and the main focus is on confidential information stored in computers. Stamatis Karnouskos described a cyberattack as follows: acts that usually originate from an unidentified source, individuals or organizations, to attack an operational system to withdraw information for purpose of stealing, destroying or altering a specified target by hacking into the susceptible system .\nNo clear definition of computer crimes has been provided because of its multiple categories, for example, the employment of computer network operations with the intent to deny adversaries the effective use of their computers, information systems and networks while ensuring the effective use of our own computers, information systems and networks. These operations include computer network attack, computer network exploration and computer network defense . Thus, many institutions have attempted to define such crimes.\nStates have different definitions of cyberattack, for example, the USA, Russia and China. The US National Research Council defines individuals or organizations as “deliberate actions to alter, disrupt, deceive, degrade, or destroy computer systems or networks or the information and/or programs resident in or transiting these systems or networks” . Notably, to avoid misunderstandings, ambiguity or gaps, this definition makes no distinction between cyberattacks and cybercrimes. By contrast, China and Russia's definition of a cyberattack focus on the free use of technology. The Shanghai Cooperation Organization  -- a political, economic and security alliance created by China, Russia, Iran, Indian, Pakistan and some of the former States of the Soviet Union -- defines a cyberattack as “mass psychological brainwashing to destabilize society and state, as well as to force the state to take decisions in the interest of an opposing party” .\nThe increasing number of cyberattacks and their effects on States have become top national security concerns and the UN has proposed a plan to help. The UN plan attempts to address the most urgent shortcomings in information security and define sustainable medium-term and long-term strategies for information security for the international community .\nThe European Union's (EU) definition of a cyberattack recognizes these events as a source of disruption, conflict and geopolitical rivalries and says that “deliberate activities to disrupt or destroy computer systems and networks. Cyber-deterrence refers to measures for\ndissuading potential perpetrators through robust systems, sanctions mechanisms and cyber-diplomacy” .\nThe literature has attempted to define a cyberattack. Junaidu Marshall and Muazu Saulawa defined a cyberattack as:“Deliberate exploitation of computer systems, technology-dependent enterprises and networks. Cyberattacks use malicious code to alter computer code, logic or data, resulting in disruptive consequences that can compromise data and lead to cybercrimes, such as information and identity theft .”Others  attempted to distinguish the purpose of a cyberattack by analyzing the motive, opportunity and methods used in the attack. All those factors affect the result of cyberattacks and hence indicate the applicable law, namely, domestic or international.",
    "### 2.2 Law applicable to cyberattacks": "The legal definition of cyberwarfare and whether it is applicable under the current Law of War in international law or has another status that should be applied under domestic laws has not been determined. Thus, whether special international criminal law should be applied to cyberattacks and whether framing this type of attack through international treaties is appropriate ought to be determined. Currently, no comprehensive international treaty or convention exists to regulate cyberattacks . Consequently, States have been using traditional methods to practice law, either by considering the event an international attack and responding to it under the Law of War or by acknowledging it as a criminal activity and prosecuting it under domestic criminal law.\nScholars such as Heather Dinniss, Francesca Spidalieri and Susan Brenner  have classified a cyberattack as a criminal act under domestic law for the following reasons: the difficulty of identifying the perpetrator and whether a State was the perpetrator; the uncertainty of whether a cyberattack can be legally considered an armed attack to which international law and the Law of War are applicable and whether the resulting damage or harm is similar to that caused by a traditional attack; and the right to use force for self-defense requires a physical attack by one State against another under the Law of War. Therefore, based on their reasons, applying domestic criminal law in cyberattack situations might be favorable.\nBy contrast, scholars such as Jeffery Carr, Louise Arimatsu and Joanna Kulesza  have classified cyberattacks under international law and Customary International Law (CIL). I support this perspective for several reasons. First, because attacking a State's infrastructure may cause as much harm and damage as an armed attack, applying domestic law would prevent the State from exercising its right of self-defense under international law, which is binding on other States. Second, applying domestic criminal law in such a case is ineffective because some States may refuse to extradite or prosecute the attackers under another State's law, which they (i.e. States and attackers) are not bound by. Third, organizing a cyberattack under international law would provide States legal cover when solving issues in international relations; by relying on the sovereign equality principle  between States, States can solve such issues in an equal, effective manner under the supervision of the international community, the UN and the Security Council.\nCyberattacks raise more challenges in enforcing the law because they are an unusual type of attack with an impact that may cross the border of a single State and may damage another State. Such cross-border damage may threaten international peace and security, violate the UN Charter and therefore transform into an international issue that should be\nInternational law enforcement\n1055\nresolved by international law rather than domestic law, which may not be binding on attackers from another State or raise the State's responsibility internationally.\nMoreover, although the classification of a cyberattack as an international attack rather than domestic attack can be based on responsibility, proving that the attack source was from another State either raises its responsibility before international law or the State will be responsible for the acts of the nonstate actors who initiated the attack from its territory because if the attackers acted within the State's borders to cause an attack, domestic criminal law is applicable because those attackers are criminals.\nTherefore, categorizing cyberattacks as domestic crimes would cause problems in applying protections to States' sovereignty in international law or in passive defense, which means preemptive protection of States, because States would have difficulty reducing the number of attacks launched from computers against its infrastructure by depending on a passive defense. Notably, a more efficient perspective is to consider a cyberattack an international crime because criminal law has been insufficiently effective at preventing cyberattacks, for example, some States, such as Russia and China, have not prosecuted their attackers for cybercrimes committed against other States, whether the attackers were located within their borders or attackers used by them .",
    "## 3. Implementation of international law on cyberattacks": "Cyberattacks are a new form of conflict. The main purpose of cyberattacks is to undermine the functions of computers and to destroy their infrastructure and networks to disrupt the communications of, for example, a company or a country. To use force under Article 39 or Article 51 of the UN Charter, there must be a \"threat to international peace and security, breach of peace or act of aggression\". Accordingly, the question becomes whether a cyberattack is a breach of peace or an act of aggression. Thus, by understanding the definition of cyber (not actual or physical) attacks, the critical question is whether international law can regulate cyberwarfare. This question is, especially, relevant because no conventions on cyberwarfare have been established.\nA comparison between the effects of an armed attack and a cyberattack can be considered from many perspectives. First, by analyzing the \"instrument approach\" , which means if the instrument used in a cyberattack can cause damage similar to the damage caused by instruments used in a kinetic attack, a cyberattack can be characterized as an armed attack, which is an act of aggression that allows the use of force. Such an act would be, for instance, using the internet to blockade a city by shutting down its power grid, because in a kinetic case, the power grid would be bombed by using more kinetic means to cause the same result.\nSecond, analyzing the \"consequences\" of the attack  can occur when the results of a cyberattack can be similarly achieved by a kinetic attack, that is, the harm and damage to a State's sovereignty or its infrastructure would be the same in both cases. Consequently, the attack has achieved the core of aggression prohibited by international law. For instance, attacking the system that operates oil wells and preventing their operation would cause the same consequences as bombing the same system, because the result of shutting down oil distribution would be the same. For example, in 2012, Iran fomented a cyberattack against one of the largest oil companies in the world, Aramco, which is owned by Saudi Arabia, by releasing the Shamoon virus. This virus caused massive damage to more than 30,000 computers within Aramco's infrastructure, which destroyed operations and business proceedings for nearly two weeks  and caused Saudi Arabia to suffer substantial financial losses.\nJFC 31,5\n1056\nThird, an analysis would be conducted on the “direct liability” that may cause severe damage against the State’s infrastructure system in the same manner that may result from an armed attack, which raises the responsibility of the aggressor State .\nTherefore, to rely on international law to justify the use of countermeasures against a cyberattack, the damage or harm that the attack caused should be equal to that caused by a physical armed attack against which the victim State would respond to protect itself (i.e. the principle of self-defense) .\nInternational relations should be built on good faith and each nation should respect the internal affairs of other nations . Otherwise, the aggressor State would be in violation of international law principles and would be attacking another State even if the attack was a cyberattack. A clear example of breaching the nonintervention principle occurred in 2007 when Russia perpetrated a cyberattack against Estonia, described as the most famous wide-range cyberattack. The duration of Russia’s cyberattack was three weeks and caused significant damage to Estonia’s electronics and telecommunication infrastructure. Apparently, the attack was in retaliation for the Estonian Government’s decision to remove a Russian monument from the center of an Estonian city, despite the threats from Russia. However, Russia’s international responsibility for committing this act of aggression against Estonia was never raised, because it was never acknowledged .\nAccordingly, a cyberattack can constitute an armed attack that causes the prohibited crime of aggression, raising the responsibility of the aggressor State and allowing the victim State to use force under Article 39 by gaining Security Council authorization.\n## 3.1 State responsibility cyberattacks\nThe concept of a State’s responsibility has been a base for international security, especially because many conflicts have arisen because of sovereignty issues. The question I attempt to answer in this section is what may raise a State’s responsibility for its actions? Due to violations of international law principles and another State’s sovereignty, the victim State may use legal measures to defend itself against any attack, cyber or kinetic, and such a matter obtains its legitimacy directly from Jus Cogen principles.\nThe speed of the growth of cyberattacks is making it difficult to track perpetrators, namely, nations and terrorists. Therefore, to raise a State’s responsibility, the attack must be proven to have been committed by the aggressor State. One of the difficulties in this matter is to prove who committed the cyberattack. In the early days of the internet, there was a unique IP address, an electronic address used to connect a user to the internet, which would indisputably identify the user to which it was assigned. Today, however, IP addresses are increasingly difficult to identify because users can now change their IP addresses and/or the location (e.g. country) in which the IP address is active. Thus, an agent located in State A can commit an attack against State B under an IP address from a State C, despite the agent’s location being State A.\nFor these reasons, the aggressor State must contribute to a cross-border cyberattack by allowing its agent to use passive measures to attack another State’s computer system to cause massive damage, which allows the victim State to use its right to defend itself against such an intrusion when the cyberattack is raised to the level of an armed attack. Thus, for those reasons, David Graham said:\nStates acting on the perceived legal requirement that they must conclusively attribute a cyberattack to another State or its agents historically have chosen to respond to cross-border cyberattacks as they would to criminal matters, employing only “passive” (computer security) measures to and urging the States from which the attacks originated to investigate and prosecute those responsible .\nJus ad bellum follows international law in its implementation and thus might also be applicable to cyber conflicts. Harold Koh stated that international law applies to cyberspace issues; however, each case should be considered individually because not all cases may justify the implementation of traditional law . With the development of technology, international law should also be developed. New challenges and new cybertechnology should be considered, especially when relying on the CIL, where States start acting against new threats by creating new customary principles that reshape international law , to develop and govern the challenges and technology in this century, where the traditional Law of War is ineffective.\nThe international responsibility borne by a State for a wrongful act falls under jus in bello. The State is also responsible for the actions of agents under its direct control and in guiding them to attack other States , a rule adopted by the ICJ and the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia . In other words, a State is responsible for implementing all measures to prevent individuals or groups from attacking other countries if they are acting solely without instruction from the State from which they are acting; otherwise, the State will have more responsibility for the attack. Thus, if a country takes all necessary measures to fight terrorist groups or hackers, it would be exempt from responsibility for a cyberattack perpetrated from within its borders against another (victim) State in the eyes of the international community and the victim State.\nIn supporting this concept, I must note that the idea of international responsibility does not apply to cyberattacks attributed to States only but also to nonstate actors (e.g. hackers and terrorists) who use the State's territory to attack another State.\n### 3.2 Nonstate actors' responsibility for a cyberattack\nTo establish such responsibility, I distinguish between cyberterrorism and cybercrime . Cyberterrorism is committed by terrorists who use computer technology to apply their activities and are internationally motivated by political issues. Cybercrime is committed by hackers using internet technology to apply personal activities, such as manipulating a bank security system to steal money.\nDetermining the physical location to determine the responsibility of an attacker is normally a critical step to reliably establish his/her identity. Only by tracing the base computer where the virus was launched, its would be easy to identify the attacker and he/she can be verified; thus, tracking is possible. Often, however, this endeavor is not possible without the support of law enforcement agencies in the same State where the attacker launched the attack, which is less likely to occur in the case of a nation State-operated attack by its agents or supported hackers. For instance, breaking the chain of the network worm released at the Olympic Winter Games opening ceremony in Pyeongchang, South Korea, in 2018, was difficult. This malware was linked to other targeted attack groups known to have attacked other locations. These links led to confusion across the InfoSec industry in their attempts to assign attribution to the attacks because the attackers continually changed addresses and info flags .\nThe role of the State in adopting laws and imposing sanctions on these acts is notable. Many States, such as Kuwait, Jordan , the UAE , Germany , the UK  and the USA , have adopted cyber and electronic criminal law to prosecute such crimes and increase the punishments, to prevent hackers of nonstate actors from committing cybercrimes or attacks. For instance, Kuwaiti law prohibits unlawful access to a computer, its system, an electronic data processing system, an automated electronic system or an information network if this entry entails the abolition, deletion, destruction, disclosure,\nJFC 31,5\n1058\nalteration or republication of data or information . This example demonstrates how States have attempted to add cybercrimes to their domestic laws.\nIn addition, even if the attacker is a nonstate actor, the victim State may invoke the principle of self-defense under the principles of law . In other words, if a cyberattack causes damage that approaches the equivalence of damage caused by an armed attack, the principle of self-defense applies to the victim State. However, the victim State may not act in self-defense if the cyber attacker acted without the support of the country in which he/she resided (or from which he/she perpetrated the attack). Thus, proof must be provided that the host State collaborated with the cybercriminal to attack the victim country to permit it (the victim country) to raise the international responsibility to invoke the right of self-defense defined in the UN Charter .\nMany substantial modifications have been applied to assure a State's responsibility for the actions of nonstate actors. Notably, an opinion of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia in the Tadic case  states that the State will be held responsible for supporting, planning or assisting groups' actions against another State. Thus, as long as the proof of the connection between the two is clear, international responsibility is established. Moreover, this creates a criterion in international responsibility when shifting between effective control (the State's responsibility) to overall control (State and nonstate actors' responsibility), which allows in both cases for the victim State to use force to defend itself .\nHowever, States should not exceed the limit of self-defense even for nonstate actors. The September 11 attacks against the USA were a clear example of a State invoking the right to self-defense, even when extending the principles of necessity for such defense and the proportionality of the attack. The USA altered its counterterrorism laws to comply with international law when it encouraged the Security Council to adopt Resolution 1373 (2001)  on fighting terrorism because it threatens international peace and security. This resolution created normative content on the use of force against nonstate actors (terrorists) located in a sovereign State (in this case, Afghanistan). Moreover, the USA practiced its right of self-defense under international law against a terrorist group called Al-Qaeda in Afghanistan. Although the USA used force against the State of Afghanistan, its intent was to strike nonstate actors located inside the country in response to their attacks against the national security of the USA.\nThe USA, in its right of self-defense, did not follow the rules of a traditional attack, namely, one State against another; by contrast, the USA relied on the CIL and the Law of War to fight the attack by creating new criteria for using force when the attack is perpetrated by nonstate actors, which had not been regulated by traditional international law. Thus, law can be developed over years on the basis of facing new challenges and danger, and the exact example is applicable to today's challenges of cyberattacks, where it can be compared with nonstate actors' cases.\nIn summary, the raising of a State's responsibility for its nonstate actors resulted from its failure to comply with international law and its violation of international rules by allowing nonstate actors to act from its territory to attack another State;  compared with a cyberattack, the responsibility raises because the State failed to prevent continued attacks against States and to investigate and prosecute the attackers for their actions within its territory and, finally, when the State failed to implement international law.",
    "## 4. International attempts to regulate cyberattacks": "The ICJ recognized in its decision in Nicaragua v. USA that the UN Charter provisions that restrict the use of force in international relations have become the CIL of jus ad bellum .\nThus, whether to categorize cyberattacks as a type of jus ad bellum and to create international instruments to govern cyberattacks become pertinent questions.\n## 4.1 Cybercrime Convention by the National Council of Europe\nThe Cybercrime Convention was adopted by the European Council in Budapest in 2001. This convention aimed to create \"criminal policy aimed at the protection of society against cybercrime [...] by adopting appropriate legislation and fostering international cooperation\" . This convention was the first on cybercrimes and cyberattacks through network by collaborating the national laws together, encouraging investigations and increasing international cooperation.\nThe principle aims of the convention are as follows:\n- harmonize the domestic criminal substantive law elements of offenses and connected provisions in the area of cybercrime;\n- provide for the domestic criminal procedural law powers necessary for the investigation and prosecution of such offenses as well as other offenses committed by means of a computer system or evidence in relation to which is in electronic form; and\n- set up a fast, effective regime of international cooperation .\nThe convention is the product of four years of work by European and international experts and has been supplemented by an additional protocol that makes any publication of racist, xenophobic propaganda through computer networks a criminal offense, similar to Criminal Libel laws. Currently, cyberterrorism is also studied in the framework of the convention. .\n## 4.2 Global program on cybercrime by the United Nations\nThe complexity of the nature of cybercrimes and cyberattacks is from the increasing development of computer information and infrastructure, where perpetrators of those crimes are located worldwide and their crimes are crossing borders without an active international response.\nThe UN has attempted to thwart cyberattacks by adopting the UNGA Resolution 55/63. This resolution calls on Member States to prevent the criminal misuse of information technologies and acknowledge the value of inter alia. The following measures combat such misuse:\n- States should ensure that their laws and practices eliminate safe havens for individuals who criminally misuse information technologies.\n- Law enforcement cooperation in the investigation and prosecution of international cases of criminal misuse of information technologies should be coordinated among all concerned States.\n- Information should be exchanged between States regarding their problems in combating the criminal misuse of information technologies .\nSubsequently, the UNGA adopted Resolution 64/180 . This resolution calls upon the UN Congress on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice to formulate solid suggestions for additional actions, drawing attention to practical arrangements to prevent organized crime and attacks, terrorism, corruption and technical assistance activities relating thereto and requests that the CCPCJ to work with the Economic and Social Council to achieve goals.\nInternational law enforcement\n1059\nMoreover, the UNGA adopted Resolution 65/230 , supporting the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Resolutions 22/7 and 22/8 , to assist Member States in their struggles and obstacles in preventing cyberattacks and to encourage cooperation in implementing international legal instruments pertaining to transnational organized cyberattacks.\nBroadly, cybercrime can be described as having cyber-dependent offenses, cyber-enabled offenses and, as a specific crime type, online international attacks. This program is designed to support Member States to prevent and combat cybercrime or international attacks against States in a holistic manner. The main geographic nexus for the Cybercrime Program in 2017 are Central America, Eastern Africa, MENA and East Asia and the Pacific, and the key aims are as follows: Increase efficiency and effectiveness in the investigation, prosecution and adjudication of cybercrime, especially online transnational cyberattacks or human rights abuse.Efficient and effective long-term whole-of-government responses to cybercrime, including national coordination, data collection and effective legal frameworks, leading to a sustainable response and greater deterrence.Strengthen national and international communication between governments, law enforcement and the private sector and increase public knowledge of cybercrime risks .\n### Tallinn Manual by NATO\nExperts at the NATO Cyber Center of Excellence have guided the center to adopt the Tallinn Manual , a manual that explains how to apply international law in cases of cyberattacks. This manual collects various CILs and fundamental laws, rules, doctrines and international principles that can govern the cyber conflicts of the international community. The Tallinn Manual highlights eight factors to consider in defining cyber operations: immediacy, presumptive legality, military factors, severity, invasiveness, directness, country involvement and measurability of effects . The IGE, which authored the Tallinn Manual, considered the ICJ's opinions and decisions on the use of force and based the manual on historical materials that have shaped this concept. The Tallinn Manual also covers “hacktivist” groups and a State's responsibility for an attack if such groups use it as a safe haven or if hacktivists are being protected by the State's intelligence agencies or officials .\nThe Tallinn Manual aims to set clear standards on situations involving cyber conflicts. For instance, the Tallinn Manual discusses the destruction and physical harm that can result from a cyberattack. According to Rule 13 of the Tallinn Manual , destruction or causalities caused by a cyberattack may elevate the attack to a level considered a “use of force”, which is prohibited by international law and the UN Charter . Even if the attacker is a nonstate actor, the victim State may invoke the principle of self-defense under the principles of law, as stated previously .\nThus, I suggest that the Tallinn Manual fills the gaps in the international law on cyber conflicts. In general practice, parties refer first to international law and then rely on the Tallinn Manual to interpret the application of law in each case;  however, the Tallinn Manual has no jurisdiction over States outside the EU; thus, it creates an international instrument only applicable to cases of cyber. The Tallinn Manual summarizes a State's responsibility if a cyberattack causes a breach in international legal obligations; raises this\npoint, based on the principles of the CIL;  and recognizes the responsibility of the agent/s responsible for cyber intrusion into another State. These aspects could lead to prosecution, for example, in the normal exercise of international laws and rules, either by the ICC or by domestic courts.\nNotably, the Tallinn Manual suggests that the term “armed” does not require the existence of weapons; however, it does stipulate that the factors of scale and affect are required to justify the victim State applying the use of force in its self-defense efforts . Eliminating the physical element (i.e. weapons) of the definition of armed means that broadening the interpretation of the term “use of force” would make the application of international laws easier in cases of cyberattacks.",
    "## 5. Conclusion": "The frequency of cyberattacks and major information leaks have been increasing annually and attackers use complex ideas, tools and techniques and, in some cases, have received State support. Some attacks affect critical infrastructure and cause major destruction; thus, they pose risks to human lives and create unprecedented data leaks of confidential and classified information that cause mass disorder. The ability to attribute such attacks to States, groups or individuals can have a critical deterrent effect. Reliable identification of the attacker's origin prevents additional attacks from occurring, even if it raises a State's responsibility. This reason is an explanation of why nation-states are highly interested in the attribution of cyberattacks.\nTraditional international law and its provisions for attacks against territorial principles do not cover cyberattacks. Because the internet and cyberspace have neither boundaries nor limits, determining the laws to apply to cyber attackers is difficult. The matter of cyber conflicts raises the issues of aggressor nations, nonstate actors, international responsibility and the principle of self-defense.\nToday, implementing only traditional international law in cases of cyberwarfare is insufficient and the international community must adopt law that regulates and governs cyberspace and cyber conflicts. In addition, clear criteria should apply internationally to develop the CIL to manage the cyber challenges of the 21st century. Recognizing this necessity, some States have adopted measures and binding laws that regulate and categorize cyber conflicts. In many cases, these provisions grant the victim State the right to protect itself against any attack; however, those regulations remain nonbinding, unless an international governance treaty is created in the international community.\nIn conclusion, I have proposed several recommendations that acknowledge the importance of framing the legal instruments of cyberattacks, for example:\n- Countries should strengthen their cyber laws and cooperate with the international community to fight and establish a legal framework to combat cyberattacks.\n- The continual advancements in the methods used to wage the endemic threat of cyberattacks lead governments to continue to attempt to prevent all types of misuse of computer information and set protections on the internet.\n- Valarie Mac Niven recommends the following: expand the power of domestic law internationally, develop a system to use limited countermeasures where appropriate and apply effective enforcement of cyber laws .\n- No consensus exists on the definition of a cyberattack; thus, the international community or the UN must adopt a binding treaty similar to the Tallinn Manual to legally regulate this crime and punish perpetrators of transnational cybercrimes against States.\nJFC 31,5\n1062"

The organization is also redefining cyberwarfare by saying that the dissemination of information “harmful to the spiritual, moral and cultural spheres of other states” should be considered a “security threat”. An accord adopted in 2009 defined “information war” as an effort by a state to undermine another’s “political, economic and social systems”. A diplomat reported in 2017 that the SCO has foiled 600 terror plots and extradited 500 terrorists through RATS. See Gjelten (2010a, 2010b) and Desai (2017).\n6.

Government security expert Richard Clarke defines cyberwar as “actions by a nation-state to penetrate another nation’s computers or networks for the purposes of causing damage or disruption” (Clarke and Knake, 2010, p. 6). Former National Security Advisor and Central Intelligence Agency Director Michael Hayden defines cyberwar as the “deliberate attempt to disable or destroy another country’s computer networks” (Gjelten, 2010a, 2010b).\n11. There have been attempts by international organizations, such as the UN, to highlight the importance of cyberattacks and to set a map for legalizing cyber. One example is the UN Internet Governance Forum (UN IGF). Internet governance was one of the most controversial issues at the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) and at the subsequent WSIS+10 review by the General Assembly in the wake of the adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2015. Cognizant that any internet governance approach should be inclusive and responsive, the WSIS mandated the UN Secretary-General to convene the Global Internet Governance Forum (IGF) for multistakeholder policy dialogue. The convening of the IGF was announced by the UN Secretary-General on July 18, 2006. Available at: www.intgovforum.org.\n12.

For many countries, cyberattacks and conflicts, and even the basic operation of cyberspace in general, are new territories. Furthermore, international law today does not address many aspects of cyber warfare, as it typically has dealt with only traditional warfare.\n**Design/methodology/approach** – This study examined this crime whether it is a domestic or an international crime and whether cyber wars are under international law or domestic law to address these issues.\n**Findings** – Although many attempts to criminalize these actions occurred, the findings suggest that the world has failed to frame the legal instruments against cyberattacks. The findings also suggest recommendations to solve this issue.\n**Originality/value** – To the best of the author's knowledge, this study analyzed the comparison between the same crime in the perspective of domestic and international law, highlighting an unsolved dilemma in the world, suggesting some unprecedented solutions to solve.\n**Keywords** Cyberattack – international law, International organizations, Self-defense – international crime **Paper type** Research paper # 1. Introduction Incidences of cyberwars have substantially increased since 1990, turning cyberspace into a battlefield on which all nations must fight. Cyberattacks have been recognized as an international problem, and in 2018, this concern became a top global threat [1]. For many countries, cyberattacks and conflicts, and even the basic operation of cyberspace, are new concerns. In addition, because of the novelty of cyber in general, today's international law fails to adequately regulate cyberwarfare.\nTo discuss the management of the dilemma of cyberspace operations, cyberattack must be defined. Moreover, for States to use force in cyberwarfare, whether the right to use force exists under Article 51 of the United Nations (UN) Charter must be determined. To address these two concerns, whether cyberwarfare is under international law or domestic law must also be determined.\nThus, allowing a State to use force against cyberattacks should be justified under international law by assessing the aggressor State's responsibility. However, acknowledging any State's responsibility for a cyber intrusion has proven to be difficult, especially if the State depends on nonstate actors to launch a cyberattack against the victim State.\nIn this article, I analyze the aforementioned aspects of cyberattacks. In Part I, I conduct a comparison between a cyberattack as a domestic crime addressed under domestic laws and Journal of Financial Crime Vol. 31 No. 5, 2024 pp. 1052-1066 © Emerald Publishing Limited 1359-0790 DOI 10.1108/JFC-07-2023-0164 as an international crime addressed under international laws. In Part II, I apply international law to cyberattacks. Finally, in Part III, I discuss committing cyberattacks by states and nonstate actors.\n## Cyberattacks as a domestic or international crime A principal challenge to managing cyberattacks is the difficulty of proving that the event occurred and if so, who perpetrated it. Today's internet is in a constant, intense state of major development and it is almost impossible to establish internet boundaries between countries or to prove any party or State committed a cyberattack. Thus, the challenge is to evaluate whether the perpetrator of the cyberattack is domestic, international or a combination of the two, to apply the applicable law and determine whether the attacks can be considered under the Law of War.\nThus, I first define the meaning of cyberattack and then observe the purpose and the results of this type of attack, committed by a State or nonstate actors and whether it is under the State's sovereignty or has crossed its borders.\n### Definition of cyberattacks The main aim of a cyberattack is to destroy computer systems of companies, institutions, ministries and other important landmarks of a State and the main focus is on confidential information stored in computers. Stamatis Karnouskos described a cyberattack as follows: acts that usually originate from an unidentified source, individuals or organizations, to attack an operational system to withdraw information for purpose of stealing, destroying or altering a specified target by hacking into the susceptible system [2].\nNo clear definition of computer crimes has been provided because of its multiple categories, for example, the employment of computer network operations with the intent to deny adversaries the effective use of their computers, information systems and networks while ensuring the effective use of our own computers, information systems and networks. These operations include computer network attack, computer network exploration and computer network defense [3]. Thus, many institutions have attempted to define such crimes.\nStates have different definitions of cyberattack, for example, the USA, Russia and China. The US National Research Council defines individuals or organizations as “deliberate actions to alter, disrupt, deceive, degrade, or destroy computer systems or networks or the information and/or programs resident in or transiting these systems or networks” [4]. Notably, to avoid misunderstandings, ambiguity or gaps, this definition makes no distinction between cyberattacks and cybercrimes. By contrast, China and Russia's definition of a cyberattack focus on the free use of technology. The Shanghai Cooperation Organization [5] -- a political, economic and security alliance created by China, Russia, Iran, Indian, Pakistan and some of the former States of the Soviet Union -- defines a cyberattack as “mass psychological brainwashing to destabilize society and state, as well as to force the state to take decisions in the interest of an opposing party” [6].\nThe increasing number of cyberattacks and their effects on States have become top national security concerns and the UN has proposed a plan to help. The UN plan attempts to address the most urgent shortcomings in information security and define sustainable medium-term and long-term strategies for information security for the international community [7].\nThe European Union's (EU) definition of a cyberattack recognizes these events as a source of disruption, conflict and geopolitical rivalries and says that “deliberate activities to disrupt or destroy computer systems and networks. Cyber-deterrence refers to measures for dissuading potential perpetrators through robust systems, sanctions mechanisms and cyber-diplomacy” [8].\nThe literature has attempted to define a cyberattack. Junaidu Marshall and Muazu Saulawa defined a cyberattack as:“Deliberate exploitation of computer systems, technology-dependent enterprises and networks. Cyberattacks use malicious code to alter computer code, logic or data, resulting in disruptive consequences that can compromise data and lead to cybercrimes, such as information and identity theft [9].”Others [10] attempted to distinguish the purpose of a cyberattack by analyzing the motive, opportunity and methods used in the attack. All those factors affect the result of cyberattacks and hence indicate the applicable law, namely, domestic or international.\n### 2.2 Law applicable to cyberattacks The legal definition of cyberwarfare and whether it is applicable under the current Law of War in international law or has another status that should be applied under domestic laws has not been determined. Thus, whether special international criminal law should be applied to cyberattacks and whether framing this type of attack through international treaties is appropriate ought to be determined. Currently, no comprehensive international treaty or convention exists to regulate cyberattacks [11]. Consequently, States have been using traditional methods to practice law, either by considering the event an international attack and responding to it under the Law of War or by acknowledging it as a criminal activity and prosecuting it under domestic criminal law.\nScholars such as Heather Dinniss, Francesca Spidalieri and Susan Brenner [12] have classified a cyberattack as a criminal act under domestic law for the following reasons: the difficulty of identifying the perpetrator and whether a State was the perpetrator; the uncertainty of whether a cyberattack can be legally considered an armed attack to which international law and the Law of War are applicable and whether the resulting damage or harm is similar to that caused by a traditional attack; and the right to use force for self-defense requires a physical attack by one State against another under the Law of War. Therefore, based on their reasons, applying domestic criminal law in cyberattack situations might be favorable.\nBy contrast, scholars such as Jeffery Carr, Louise Arimatsu and Joanna Kulesza [13] have classified cyberattacks under international law and Customary International Law (CIL). I support this perspective for several reasons. First, because attacking a State's infrastructure may cause as much harm and damage as an armed attack, applying domestic law would prevent the State from exercising its right of self-defense under international law, which is binding on other States. Second, applying domestic criminal law in such a case is ineffective because some States may refuse to extradite or prosecute the attackers under another State's law, which they (i.e. States and attackers) are not bound by. Third, organizing a cyberattack under international law would provide States legal cover when solving issues in international relations; by relying on the sovereign equality principle [14] between States, States can solve such issues in an equal, effective manner under the supervision of the international community, the UN and the Security Council.\nCyberattacks raise more challenges in enforcing the law because they are an unusual type of attack with an impact that may cross the border of a single State and may damage another State. Such cross-border damage may threaten international peace and security, violate the UN Charter and therefore transform into an international issue that should be International law enforcement Moreover, although the classification of a cyberattack as an international attack rather than domestic attack can be based on responsibility, proving that the attack source was from another State either raises its responsibility before international law or the State will be responsible for the acts of the nonstate actors who initiated the attack from its territory because if the attackers acted within the State's borders to cause an attack, domestic criminal law is applicable because those attackers are criminals.\nTherefore, categorizing cyberattacks as domestic crimes would cause problems in applying protections to States' sovereignty in international law or in passive defense, which means preemptive protection of States, because States would have difficulty reducing the number of attacks launched from computers against its infrastructure by depending on a passive defense. Notably, a more efficient perspective is to consider a cyberattack an international crime because criminal law has been insufficiently effective at preventing cyberattacks, for example, some States, such as Russia and China, have not prosecuted their attackers for cybercrimes committed against other States, whether the attackers were located within their borders or attackers used by them [15].\n## 3. Implementation of international law on cyberattacks Cyberattacks are a new form of conflict. The main purpose of cyberattacks is to undermine the functions of computers and to destroy their infrastructure and networks to disrupt the communications of, for example, a company or a country. To use force under Article 39 or Article 51 of the UN Charter, there must be a\"threat to international peace and security, breach of peace or act of aggression\". Accordingly, the question becomes whether a cyberattack is a breach of peace or an act of aggression. Thus, by understanding the definition of cyber (not actual or physical) attacks, the critical question is whether international law can regulate cyberwarfare. This question is, especially, relevant because no conventions on cyberwarfare have been established.\nA comparison between the effects of an armed attack and a cyberattack can be considered from many perspectives. First, by analyzing the\"instrument approach\"[16], which means if the instrument used in a cyberattack can cause damage similar to the damage caused by instruments used in a kinetic attack, a cyberattack can be characterized as an armed attack, which is an act of aggression that allows the use of force. Such an act would be, for instance, using the internet to blockade a city by shutting down its power grid, because in a kinetic case, the power grid would be bombed by using more kinetic means to cause the same result.\nSecond, analyzing the\"consequences\"of the attack [17] can occur when the results of a cyberattack can be similarly achieved by a kinetic attack, that is, the harm and damage to a State's sovereignty or its infrastructure would be the same in both cases. Consequently, the attack has achieved the core of aggression prohibited by international law. For instance, attacking the system that operates oil wells and preventing their operation would cause the same consequences as bombing the same system, because the result of shutting down oil distribution would be the same. For example, in 2012, Iran fomented a cyberattack against one of the largest oil companies in the world, Aramco, which is owned by Saudi Arabia, by releasing the Shamoon virus. This virus caused massive damage to more than 30,000 computers within Aramco's infrastructure, which destroyed operations and business proceedings for nearly two weeks [18] and caused Saudi Arabia to suffer substantial financial losses.\nJFC 31,5 Therefore, to rely on international law to justify the use of countermeasures against a cyberattack, the damage or harm that the attack caused should be equal to that caused by a physical armed attack against which the victim State would respond to protect itself (i.e. the principle of self-defense) [20].\nInternational relations should be built on good faith and each nation should respect the internal affairs of other nations [21]. Otherwise, the aggressor State would be in violation of international law principles and would be attacking another State even if the attack was a cyberattack. A clear example of breaching the nonintervention principle occurred in 2007 when Russia perpetrated a cyberattack against Estonia, described as the most famous wide-range cyberattack. The duration of Russia’s cyberattack was three weeks and caused significant damage to Estonia’s electronics and telecommunication infrastructure. Apparently, the attack was in retaliation for the Estonian Government’s decision to remove a Russian monument from the center of an Estonian city, despite the threats from Russia. However, Russia’s international responsibility for committing this act of aggression against Estonia was never raised, because it was never acknowledged [22].\nAccordingly, a cyberattack can constitute an armed attack that causes the prohibited crime of aggression, raising the responsibility of the aggressor State and allowing the victim State to use force under Article 39 by gaining Security Council authorization.\n## 3.1 State responsibility cyberattacks The concept of a State’s responsibility has been a base for international security, especially because many conflicts have arisen because of sovereignty issues. The question I attempt to answer in this section is what may raise a State’s responsibility for its actions? Due to violations of international law principles and another State’s sovereignty, the victim State may use legal measures to defend itself against any attack, cyber or kinetic, and such a matter obtains its legitimacy directly from Jus Cogen principles.\nThe speed of the growth of cyberattacks is making it difficult to track perpetrators, namely, nations and terrorists. Therefore, to raise a State’s responsibility, the attack must be proven to have been committed by the aggressor State. One of the difficulties in this matter is to prove who committed the cyberattack. In the early days of the internet, there was a unique IP address, an electronic address used to connect a user to the internet, which would indisputably identify the user to which it was assigned. Today, however, IP addresses are increasingly difficult to identify because users can now change their IP addresses and/or the location (e.g. country) in which the IP address is active. Thus, an agent located in State A can commit an attack against State B under an IP address from a State C, despite the agent’s location being State A.\nFor these reasons, the aggressor State must contribute to a cross-border cyberattack by allowing its agent to use passive measures to attack another State’s computer system to cause massive damage, which allows the victim State to use its right to defend itself against such an intrusion when the cyberattack is raised to the level of an armed attack. Thus, for those reasons, David Graham said: States acting on the perceived legal requirement that they must conclusively attribute a cyberattack to another State or its agents historically have chosen to respond to cross-border cyberattacks as they would to criminal matters, employing only “passive” (computer security) measures to and urging the States from which the attacks originated to investigate and prosecute those responsible [23].\nJus ad bellum follows international law in its implementation and thus might also be applicable to cyber conflicts. Harold Koh stated that international law applies to cyberspace issues; however, each case should be considered individually because not all cases may justify the implementation of traditional law [24]. With the development of technology, international law should also be developed. New challenges and new cybertechnology should be considered, especially when relying on the CIL, where States start acting against new threats by creating new customary principles that reshape international law [25], to develop and govern the challenges and technology in this century, where the traditional Law of War is ineffective.\nThe international responsibility borne by a State for a wrongful act falls under jus in bello. The State is also responsible for the actions of agents under its direct control and in guiding them to attack other States [26], a rule adopted by the ICJ and the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia [27]. In other words, a State is responsible for implementing all measures to prevent individuals or groups from attacking other countries if they are acting solely without instruction from the State from which they are acting; otherwise, the State will have more responsibility for the attack. Thus, if a country takes all necessary measures to fight terrorist groups or hackers, it would be exempt from responsibility for a cyberattack perpetrated from within its borders against another (victim) State in the eyes of the international community and the victim State.\nIn supporting this concept, I must note that the idea of international responsibility does not apply to cyberattacks attributed to States only but also to nonstate actors (e.g. hackers and terrorists) who use the State's territory to attack another State.\n### 3.2 Nonstate actors' responsibility for a cyberattack To establish such responsibility, I distinguish between cyberterrorism and cybercrime [28]. Cyberterrorism is committed by terrorists who use computer technology to apply their activities and are internationally motivated by political issues. Cybercrime is committed by hackers using internet technology to apply personal activities, such as manipulating a bank security system to steal money.\nDetermining the physical location to determine the responsibility of an attacker is normally a critical step to reliably establish his/her identity. Only by tracing the base computer where the virus was launched, its would be easy to identify the attacker and he/she can be verified; thus, tracking is possible. Often, however, this endeavor is not possible without the support of law enforcement agencies in the same State where the attacker launched the attack, which is less likely to occur in the case of a nation State-operated attack by its agents or supported hackers. For instance, breaking the chain of the network worm released at the Olympic Winter Games opening ceremony in Pyeongchang, South Korea, in 2018, was difficult. This malware was linked to other targeted attack groups known to have attacked other locations. These links led to confusion across the InfoSec industry in their attempts to assign attribution to the attacks because the attackers continually changed addresses and info flags [29].\nThe role of the State in adopting laws and imposing sanctions on these acts is notable. Many States, such as Kuwait, Jordan [30], the UAE [31], Germany [32], the UK [33] and the USA [34], have adopted cyber and electronic criminal law to prosecute such crimes and increase the punishments, to prevent hackers of nonstate actors from committing cybercrimes or attacks. For instance, Kuwaiti law prohibits unlawful access to a computer, its system, an electronic data processing system, an automated electronic system or an information network if this entry entails the abolition, deletion, destruction, disclosure, JFC 31,5 In addition, even if the attacker is a nonstate actor, the victim State may invoke the principle of self-defense under the principles of law [36]. In other words, if a cyberattack causes damage that approaches the equivalence of damage caused by an armed attack, the principle of self-defense applies to the victim State. However, the victim State may not act in self-defense if the cyber attacker acted without the support of the country in which he/she resided (or from which he/she perpetrated the attack). Thus, proof must be provided that the host State collaborated with the cybercriminal to attack the victim country to permit it (the victim country) to raise the international responsibility to invoke the right of self-defense defined in the UN Charter [37].\nMany substantial modifications have been applied to assure a State's responsibility for the actions of nonstate actors. Notably, an opinion of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia in the Tadic case [38] states that the State will be held responsible for supporting, planning or assisting groups' actions against another State. Thus, as long as the proof of the connection between the two is clear, international responsibility is established. Moreover, this creates a criterion in international responsibility when shifting between effective control (the State's responsibility) to overall control (State and nonstate actors' responsibility), which allows in both cases for the victim State to use force to defend itself [39].\nHowever, States should not exceed the limit of self-defense even for nonstate actors. The September 11 attacks against the USA were a clear example of a State invoking the right to self-defense, even when extending the principles of necessity for such defense and the proportionality of the attack. The USA altered its counterterrorism laws to comply with international law when it encouraged the Security Council to adopt Resolution 1373 (2001) [40] on fighting terrorism because it threatens international peace and security. This resolution created normative content on the use of force against nonstate actors (terrorists) located in a sovereign State (in this case, Afghanistan). Moreover, the USA practiced its right of self-defense under international law against a terrorist group called Al-Qaeda in Afghanistan. Although the USA used force against the State of Afghanistan, its intent was to strike nonstate actors located inside the country in response to their attacks against the national security of the USA.\nThe USA, in its right of self-defense, did not follow the rules of a traditional attack, namely, one State against another; by contrast, the USA relied on the CIL and the Law of War to fight the attack by creating new criteria for using force when the attack is perpetrated by nonstate actors, which had not been regulated by traditional international law. Thus, law can be developed over years on the basis of facing new challenges and danger, and the exact example is applicable to today's challenges of cyberattacks, where it can be compared with nonstate actors' cases.\nIn summary, the raising of a State's responsibility for its nonstate actors resulted from its failure to comply with international law and its violation of international rules by allowing nonstate actors to act from its territory to attack another State; [41] compared with a cyberattack, the responsibility raises because the State failed to prevent continued attacks against States and to investigate and prosecute the attackers for their actions within its territory and, finally, when the State failed to implement international law.\n## 4. International attempts to regulate cyberattacks The ICJ recognized in its decision in Nicaragua v. USA that the UN Charter provisions that restrict the use of force in international relations have become the CIL of jus ad bellum [42].\nThus, whether to categorize cyberattacks as a type of jus ad bellum and to create international instruments to govern cyberattacks become pertinent questions.\n## 4.1 Cybercrime Convention by the National Council of Europe The Cybercrime Convention was adopted by the European Council in Budapest in 2001. This convention aimed to create\"criminal policy aimed at the protection of society against cybercrime [...] by adopting appropriate legislation and fostering international cooperation\"[43]. This convention was the first on cybercrimes and cyberattacks through network by collaborating the national laws together, encouraging investigations and increasing international cooperation.\nThe principle aims of the convention are as follows: - harmonize the domestic criminal substantive law elements of offenses and connected provisions in the area of cybercrime; - provide for the domestic criminal procedural law powers necessary for the investigation and prosecution of such offenses as well as other offenses committed by means of a computer system or evidence in relation to which is in electronic form; and - set up a fast, effective regime of international cooperation [44].\nThe convention is the product of four years of work by European and international experts and has been supplemented by an additional protocol that makes any publication of racist, xenophobic propaganda through computer networks a criminal offense, similar to Criminal Libel laws. Currently, cyberterrorism is also studied in the framework of the convention. [45].\n## 4.2 Global program on cybercrime by the United Nations The complexity of the nature of cybercrimes and cyberattacks is from the increasing development of computer information and infrastructure, where perpetrators of those crimes are located worldwide and their crimes are crossing borders without an active international response.\nThe UN has attempted to thwart cyberattacks by adopting the UNGA Resolution 55/63. This resolution calls on Member States to prevent the criminal misuse of information technologies and acknowledge the value of inter alia. The following measures combat such misuse: - States should ensure that their laws and practices eliminate safe havens for individuals who criminally misuse information technologies.\n- Law enforcement cooperation in the investigation and prosecution of international cases of criminal misuse of information technologies should be coordinated among all concerned States.\n- Information should be exchanged between States regarding their problems in combating the criminal misuse of information technologies [46].\nSubsequently, the UNGA adopted Resolution 64/180 [47]. This resolution calls upon the UN Congress on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice to formulate solid suggestions for additional actions, drawing attention to practical arrangements to prevent organized crime and attacks, terrorism, corruption and technical assistance activities relating thereto and requests that the CCPCJ to work with the Economic and Social Council to achieve goals.\nInternational law enforcement Broadly, cybercrime can be described as having cyber-dependent offenses, cyber-enabled offenses and, as a specific crime type, online international attacks. This program is designed to support Member States to prevent and combat cybercrime or international attacks against States in a holistic manner. The main geographic nexus for the Cybercrime Program in 2017 are Central America, Eastern Africa, MENA and East Asia and the Pacific, and the key aims are as follows: Increase efficiency and effectiveness in the investigation, prosecution and adjudication of cybercrime, especially online transnational cyberattacks or human rights abuse.Efficient and effective long-term whole-of-government responses to cybercrime, including national coordination, data collection and effective legal frameworks, leading to a sustainable response and greater deterrence.Strengthen national and international communication between governments, law enforcement and the private sector and increase public knowledge of cybercrime risks [50].\n### Tallinn Manual by NATO Experts at the NATO Cyber Center of Excellence have guided the center to adopt the Tallinn Manual [51], a manual that explains how to apply international law in cases of cyberattacks. This manual collects various CILs and fundamental laws, rules, doctrines and international principles that can govern the cyber conflicts of the international community. The Tallinn Manual highlights eight factors to consider in defining cyber operations: immediacy, presumptive legality, military factors, severity, invasiveness, directness, country involvement and measurability of effects [52]. The IGE, which authored the Tallinn Manual, considered the ICJ's opinions and decisions on the use of force and based the manual on historical materials that have shaped this concept. The Tallinn Manual also covers “hacktivist” groups and a State's responsibility for an attack if such groups use it as a safe haven or if hacktivists are being protected by the State's intelligence agencies or officials [53].\nThe Tallinn Manual aims to set clear standards on situations involving cyber conflicts. For instance, the Tallinn Manual discusses the destruction and physical harm that can result from a cyberattack. According to Rule 13 of the Tallinn Manual [54], destruction or causalities caused by a cyberattack may elevate the attack to a level considered a “use of force”, which is prohibited by international law and the UN Charter [55]. Even if the attacker is a nonstate actor, the victim State may invoke the principle of self-defense under the principles of law, as stated previously [56].\nThus, I suggest that the Tallinn Manual fills the gaps in the international law on cyber conflicts. In general practice, parties refer first to international law and then rely on the Tallinn Manual to interpret the application of law in each case; [57] however, the Tallinn Manual has no jurisdiction over States outside the EU; thus, it creates an international instrument only applicable to cases of cyber. The Tallinn Manual summarizes a State's responsibility if a cyberattack causes a breach in international legal obligations; raises this point, based on the principles of the CIL; [58] and recognizes the responsibility of the agent/s responsible for cyber intrusion into another State. These aspects could lead to prosecution, for example, in the normal exercise of international laws and rules, either by the ICC or by domestic courts.\nNotably, the Tallinn Manual suggests that the term “armed” does not require the existence of weapons; however, it does stipulate that the factors of scale and affect are required to justify the victim State applying the use of force in its self-defense efforts [59]. Eliminating the physical element (i.e. weapons) of the definition of armed means that broadening the interpretation of the term “use of force” would make the application of international laws easier in cases of cyberattacks.\n## 5. Conclusion The frequency of cyberattacks and major information leaks have been increasing annually and attackers use complex ideas, tools and techniques and, in some cases, have received State support. Some attacks affect critical infrastructure and cause major destruction; thus, they pose risks to human lives and create unprecedented data leaks of confidential and classified information that cause mass disorder. The ability to attribute such attacks to States, groups or individuals can have a critical deterrent effect. Reliable identification of the attacker's origin prevents additional attacks from occurring, even if it raises a State's responsibility. This reason is an explanation of why nation-states are highly interested in the attribution of cyberattacks.\nTraditional international law and its provisions for attacks against territorial principles do not cover cyberattacks. Because the internet and cyberspace have neither boundaries nor limits, determining the laws to apply to cyber attackers is difficult. The matter of cyber conflicts raises the issues of aggressor nations, nonstate actors, international responsibility and the principle of self-defense.\nToday, implementing only traditional international law in cases of cyberwarfare is insufficient and the international community must adopt law that regulates and governs cyberspace and cyber conflicts. In addition, clear criteria should apply internationally to develop the CIL to manage the cyber challenges of the 21st century. Recognizing this necessity, some States have adopted measures and binding laws that regulate and categorize cyber conflicts. In many cases, these provisions grant the victim State the right to protect itself against any attack; however, those regulations remain nonbinding, unless an international governance treaty is created in the international community.\nIn conclusion, I have proposed several recommendations that acknowledge the importance of framing the legal instruments of cyberattacks, for example: - Countries should strengthen their cyber laws and cooperate with the international community to fight and establish a legal framework to combat cyberattacks.\n- The continual advancements in the methods used to wage the endemic threat of cyberattacks lead governments to continue to attempt to prevent all types of misuse of computer information and set protections on the internet.\n- Valarie Mac Niven recommends the following: expand the power of domestic law internationally, develop a system to use limited countermeasures where appropriate and apply effective enforcement of cyber laws [60].\n- No consensus exists on the definition of a cyberattack; thus, the international community or the UN must adopt a binding treaty similar to the Tallinn Manual to legally regulate this crime and punish perpetrators of transnational cybercrimes against States.\nJFC 31,5 1062",

For many countries, cyberattacks and conflicts, and even the basic operation of cyberspace in general, are new territories. Furthermore, international law today does not address many aspects of cyber warfare, as it typically has dealt with only traditional warfare.\n**Design/methodology/approach** – This study examined this crime whether it is a domestic or an international crime and whether cyber wars are under international law or domestic law to address these issues.\n**Findings** – Although many attempts to criminalize these actions occurred, the findings suggest that the world has failed to frame the legal instruments against cyberattacks. The findings also suggest recommendations to solve this issue.\n**Originality/value** – To the best of the author's knowledge, this study analyzed the comparison between the same crime in the perspective of domestic and international law, highlighting an unsolved dilemma in the world, suggesting some unprecedented solutions to solve.\n**Keywords** Cyberattack – international law, International organizations, Self-defense – international crime **Paper type** Research paper # 1. Introduction Incidences of cyberwars have substantially increased since 1990, turning cyberspace into a battlefield on which all nations must fight. Cyberattacks have been recognized as an international problem, and in 2018, this concern became a top global threat [1]. For many countries, cyberattacks and conflicts, and even the basic operation of cyberspace, are new concerns. In addition, because of the novelty of cyber in general, today's international law fails to adequately regulate cyberwarfare.\nTo discuss the management of the dilemma of cyberspace operations, cyberattack must be defined. Moreover, for States to use force in cyberwarfare, whether the right to use force exists under Article 51 of the United Nations (UN) Charter must be determined. To address these two concerns, whether cyberwarfare is under international law or domestic law must also be determined.\nThus, allowing a State to use force against cyberattacks should be justified under international law by assessing the aggressor State's responsibility. However, acknowledging any State's responsibility for a cyber intrusion has proven to be difficult, especially if the State depends on nonstate actors to launch a cyberattack against the victim State.\nIn this article, I analyze the aforementioned aspects of cyberattacks. In Part I, I conduct a comparison between a cyberattack as a domestic crime addressed under domestic laws and Journal of Financial Crime Vol. 31 No. 5, 2024 pp. 1052-1066 © Emerald Publishing Limited 1359-0790 DOI 10.1108/JFC-07-2023-0164 as an international crime addressed under international laws. In Part II, I apply international law to cyberattacks. Finally, in Part III, I discuss committing cyberattacks by states and nonstate actors.\n## Cyberattacks as a domestic or international crime A principal challenge to managing cyberattacks is the difficulty of proving that the event occurred and if so, who perpetrated it. Today's internet is in a constant, intense state of major development and it is almost impossible to establish internet boundaries between countries or to prove any party or State committed a cyberattack. Thus, the challenge is to evaluate whether the perpetrator of the cyberattack is domestic, international or a combination of the two, to apply the applicable law and determine whether the attacks can be considered under the Law of War.\nThus, I first define the meaning of cyberattack and then observe the purpose and the results of this type of attack, committed by a State or nonstate actors and whether it is under the State's sovereignty or has crossed its borders.\n### Definition of cyberattacks The main aim of a cyberattack is to destroy computer systems of companies, institutions, ministries and other important landmarks of a State and the main focus is on confidential information stored in computers. Stamatis Karnouskos described a cyberattack as follows: acts that usually originate from an unidentified source, individuals or organizations, to attack an operational system to withdraw information for purpose of stealing, destroying or altering a specified target by hacking into the susceptible system [2].\nNo clear definition of computer crimes has been provided because of its multiple categories, for example, the employment of computer network operations with the intent to deny adversaries the effective use of their computers, information systems and networks while ensuring the effective use of our own computers, information systems and networks. These operations include computer network attack, computer network exploration and computer network defense [3]. Thus, many institutions have attempted to define such crimes.\nStates have different definitions of cyberattack, for example, the USA, Russia and China. The US National Research Council defines individuals or organizations as “deliberate actions to alter, disrupt, deceive, degrade, or destroy computer systems or networks or the information and/or programs resident in or transiting these systems or networks” [4]. Notably, to avoid misunderstandings, ambiguity or gaps, this definition makes no distinction between cyberattacks and cybercrimes. By contrast, China and Russia's definition of a cyberattack focus on the free use of technology. The Shanghai Cooperation Organization [5] -- a political, economic and security alliance created by China, Russia, Iran, Indian, Pakistan and some of the former States of the Soviet Union -- defines a cyberattack as “mass psychological brainwashing to destabilize society and state, as well as to force the state to take decisions in the interest of an opposing party” [6].\nThe increasing number of cyberattacks and their effects on States have become top national security concerns and the UN has proposed a plan to help. The UN plan attempts to address the most urgent shortcomings in information security and define sustainable medium-term and long-term strategies for information security for the international community [7].\nThe European Union's (EU) definition of a cyberattack recognizes these events as a source of disruption, conflict and geopolitical rivalries and says that “deliberate activities to disrupt or destroy computer systems and networks. Cyber-deterrence refers to measures for dissuading potential perpetrators through robust systems, sanctions mechanisms and cyber-diplomacy” [8].\nThe literature has attempted to define a cyberattack. Junaidu Marshall and Muazu Saulawa defined a cyberattack as:“Deliberate exploitation of computer systems, technology-dependent enterprises and networks. Cyberattacks use malicious code to alter computer code, logic or data, resulting in disruptive consequences that can compromise data and lead to cybercrimes, such as information and identity theft [9].”Others [10] attempted to distinguish the purpose of a cyberattack by analyzing the motive, opportunity and methods used in the attack. All those factors affect the result of cyberattacks and hence indicate the applicable law, namely, domestic or international.\n### 2.2 Law applicable to cyberattacks The legal definition of cyberwarfare and whether it is applicable under the current Law of War in international law or has another status that should be applied under domestic laws has not been determined. Thus, whether special international criminal law should be applied to cyberattacks and whether framing this type of attack through international treaties is appropriate ought to be determined. Currently, no comprehensive international treaty or convention exists to regulate cyberattacks [11]. Consequently, States have been using traditional methods to practice law, either by considering the event an international attack and responding to it under the Law of War or by acknowledging it as a criminal activity and prosecuting it under domestic criminal law.\nScholars such as Heather Dinniss, Francesca Spidalieri and Susan Brenner [12] have classified a cyberattack as a criminal act under domestic law for the following reasons: the difficulty of identifying the perpetrator and whether a State was the perpetrator; the uncertainty of whether a cyberattack can be legally considered an armed attack to which international law and the Law of War are applicable and whether the resulting damage or harm is similar to that caused by a traditional attack; and the right to use force for self-defense requires a physical attack by one State against another under the Law of War. Therefore, based on their reasons, applying domestic criminal law in cyberattack situations might be favorable.\nBy contrast, scholars such as Jeffery Carr, Louise Arimatsu and Joanna Kulesza [13] have classified cyberattacks under international law and Customary International Law (CIL). I support this perspective for several reasons. First, because attacking a State's infrastructure may cause as much harm and damage as an armed attack, applying domestic law would prevent the State from exercising its right of self-defense under international law, which is binding on other States. Second, applying domestic criminal law in such a case is ineffective because some States may refuse to extradite or prosecute the attackers under another State's law, which they (i.e. States and attackers) are not bound by. Third, organizing a cyberattack under international law would provide States legal cover when solving issues in international relations; by relying on the sovereign equality principle [14] between States, States can solve such issues in an equal, effective manner under the supervision of the international community, the UN and the Security Council.\nCyberattacks raise more challenges in enforcing the law because they are an unusual type of attack with an impact that may cross the border of a single State and may damage another State. Such cross-border damage may threaten international peace and security, violate the UN Charter and therefore transform into an international issue that should be International law enforcement Moreover, although the classification of a cyberattack as an international attack rather than domestic attack can be based on responsibility, proving that the attack source was from another State either raises its responsibility before international law or the State will be responsible for the acts of the nonstate actors who initiated the attack from its territory because if the attackers acted within the State's borders to cause an attack, domestic criminal law is applicable because those attackers are criminals.\nTherefore, categorizing cyberattacks as domestic crimes would cause problems in applying protections to States' sovereignty in international law or in passive defense, which means preemptive protection of States, because States would have difficulty reducing the number of attacks launched from computers against its infrastructure by depending on a passive defense. Notably, a more efficient perspective is to consider a cyberattack an international crime because criminal law has been insufficiently effective at preventing cyberattacks, for example, some States, such as Russia and China, have not prosecuted their attackers for cybercrimes committed against other States, whether the attackers were located within their borders or attackers used by them [15].\n## 3. Implementation of international law on cyberattacks Cyberattacks are a new form of conflict. The main purpose of cyberattacks is to undermine the functions of computers and to destroy their infrastructure and networks to disrupt the communications of, for example, a company or a country. To use force under Article 39 or Article 51 of the UN Charter, there must be a\"threat to international peace and security, breach of peace or act of aggression\". Accordingly, the question becomes whether a cyberattack is a breach of peace or an act of aggression. Thus, by understanding the definition of cyber (not actual or physical) attacks, the critical question is whether international law can regulate cyberwarfare. This question is, especially, relevant because no conventions on cyberwarfare have been established.\nA comparison between the effects of an armed attack and a cyberattack can be considered from many perspectives. First, by analyzing the\"instrument approach\"[16], which means if the instrument used in a cyberattack can cause damage similar to the damage caused by instruments used in a kinetic attack, a cyberattack can be characterized as an armed attack, which is an act of aggression that allows the use of force. Such an act would be, for instance, using the internet to blockade a city by shutting down its power grid, because in a kinetic case, the power grid would be bombed by using more kinetic means to cause the same result.\nSecond, analyzing the\"consequences\"of the attack [17] can occur when the results of a cyberattack can be similarly achieved by a kinetic attack, that is, the harm and damage to a State's sovereignty or its infrastructure would be the same in both cases. Consequently, the attack has achieved the core of aggression prohibited by international law. For instance, attacking the system that operates oil wells and preventing their operation would cause the same consequences as bombing the same system, because the result of shutting down oil distribution would be the same. For example, in 2012, Iran fomented a cyberattack against one of the largest oil companies in the world, Aramco, which is owned by Saudi Arabia, by releasing the Shamoon virus. This virus caused massive damage to more than 30,000 computers within Aramco's infrastructure, which destroyed operations and business proceedings for nearly two weeks [18] and caused Saudi Arabia to suffer substantial financial losses.\nJFC 31,5 Therefore, to rely on international law to justify the use of countermeasures against a cyberattack, the damage or harm that the attack caused should be equal to that caused by a physical armed attack against which the victim State would respond to protect itself (i.e. the principle of self-defense) [20].\nInternational relations should be built on good faith and each nation should respect the internal affairs of other nations [21]. Otherwise, the aggressor State would be in violation of international law principles and would be attacking another State even if the attack was a cyberattack. A clear example of breaching the nonintervention principle occurred in 2007 when Russia perpetrated a cyberattack against Estonia, described as the most famous wide-range cyberattack. The duration of Russia’s cyberattack was three weeks and caused significant damage to Estonia’s electronics and telecommunication infrastructure. Apparently, the attack was in retaliation for the Estonian Government’s decision to remove a Russian monument from the center of an Estonian city, despite the threats from Russia. However, Russia’s international responsibility for committing this act of aggression against Estonia was never raised, because it was never acknowledged [22].\nAccordingly, a cyberattack can constitute an armed attack that causes the prohibited crime of aggression, raising the responsibility of the aggressor State and allowing the victim State to use force under Article 39 by gaining Security Council authorization.\n## 3.1 State responsibility cyberattacks The concept of a State’s responsibility has been a base for international security, especially because many conflicts have arisen because of sovereignty issues. The question I attempt to answer in this section is what may raise a State’s responsibility for its actions? Due to violations of international law principles and another State’s sovereignty, the victim State may use legal measures to defend itself against any attack, cyber or kinetic, and such a matter obtains its legitimacy directly from Jus Cogen principles.\nThe speed of the growth of cyberattacks is making it difficult to track perpetrators, namely, nations and terrorists. Therefore, to raise a State’s responsibility, the attack must be proven to have been committed by the aggressor State. One of the difficulties in this matter is to prove who committed the cyberattack. In the early days of the internet, there was a unique IP address, an electronic address used to connect a user to the internet, which would indisputably identify the user to which it was assigned. Today, however, IP addresses are increasingly difficult to identify because users can now change their IP addresses and/or the location (e.g. country) in which the IP address is active. Thus, an agent located in State A can commit an attack against State B under an IP address from a State C, despite the agent’s location being State A.\nFor these reasons, the aggressor State must contribute to a cross-border cyberattack by allowing its agent to use passive measures to attack another State’s computer system to cause massive damage, which allows the victim State to use its right to defend itself against such an intrusion when the cyberattack is raised to the level of an armed attack. Thus, for those reasons, David Graham said: States acting on the perceived legal requirement that they must conclusively attribute a cyberattack to another State or its agents historically have chosen to respond to cross-border cyberattacks as they would to criminal matters, employing only “passive” (computer security) measures to and urging the States from which the attacks originated to investigate and prosecute those responsible [23].\nJus ad bellum follows international law in its implementation and thus might also be applicable to cyber conflicts. Harold Koh stated that international law applies to cyberspace issues; however, each case should be considered individually because not all cases may justify the implementation of traditional law [24]. With the development of technology, international law should also be developed. New challenges and new cybertechnology should be considered, especially when relying on the CIL, where States start acting against new threats by creating new customary principles that reshape international law [25], to develop and govern the challenges and technology in this century, where the traditional Law of War is ineffective.\nThe international responsibility borne by a State for a wrongful act falls under jus in bello. The State is also responsible for the actions of agents under its direct control and in guiding them to attack other States [26], a rule adopted by the ICJ and the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia [27]. In other words, a State is responsible for implementing all measures to prevent individuals or groups from attacking other countries if they are acting solely without instruction from the State from which they are acting; otherwise, the State will have more responsibility for the attack. Thus, if a country takes all necessary measures to fight terrorist groups or hackers, it would be exempt from responsibility for a cyberattack perpetrated from within its borders against another (victim) State in the eyes of the international community and the victim State.\nIn supporting this concept, I must note that the idea of international responsibility does not apply to cyberattacks attributed to States only but also to nonstate actors (e.g. hackers and terrorists) who use the State's territory to attack another State.\n### 3.2 Nonstate actors' responsibility for a cyberattack To establish such responsibility, I distinguish between cyberterrorism and cybercrime [28]. Cyberterrorism is committed by terrorists who use computer technology to apply their activities and are internationally motivated by political issues. Cybercrime is committed by hackers using internet technology to apply personal activities, such as manipulating a bank security system to steal money.\nDetermining the physical location to determine the responsibility of an attacker is normally a critical step to reliably establish his/her identity. Only by tracing the base computer where the virus was launched, its would be easy to identify the attacker and he/she can be verified; thus, tracking is possible. Often, however, this endeavor is not possible without the support of law enforcement agencies in the same State where the attacker launched the attack, which is less likely to occur in the case of a nation State-operated attack by its agents or supported hackers. For instance, breaking the chain of the network worm released at the Olympic Winter Games opening ceremony in Pyeongchang, South Korea, in 2018, was difficult. This malware was linked to other targeted attack groups known to have attacked other locations. These links led to confusion across the InfoSec industry in their attempts to assign attribution to the attacks because the attackers continually changed addresses and info flags [29].\nThe role of the State in adopting laws and imposing sanctions on these acts is notable. Many States, such as Kuwait, Jordan [30], the UAE [31], Germany [32], the UK [33] and the USA [34], have adopted cyber and electronic criminal law to prosecute such crimes and increase the punishments, to prevent hackers of nonstate actors from committing cybercrimes or attacks. For instance, Kuwaiti law prohibits unlawful access to a computer, its system, an electronic data processing system, an automated electronic system or an information network if this entry entails the abolition, deletion, destruction, disclosure, JFC 31,5 In addition, even if the attacker is a nonstate actor, the victim State may invoke the principle of self-defense under the principles of law [36]. In other words, if a cyberattack causes damage that approaches the equivalence of damage caused by an armed attack, the principle of self-defense applies to the victim State. However, the victim State may not act in self-defense if the cyber attacker acted without the support of the country in which he/she resided (or from which he/she perpetrated the attack). Thus, proof must be provided that the host State collaborated with the cybercriminal to attack the victim country to permit it (the victim country) to raise the international responsibility to invoke the right of self-defense defined in the UN Charter [37].\nMany substantial modifications have been applied to assure a State's responsibility for the actions of nonstate actors. Notably, an opinion of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia in the Tadic case [38] states that the State will be held responsible for supporting, planning or assisting groups' actions against another State. Thus, as long as the proof of the connection between the two is clear, international responsibility is established. Moreover, this creates a criterion in international responsibility when shifting between effective control (the State's responsibility) to overall control (State and nonstate actors' responsibility), which allows in both cases for the victim State to use force to defend itself [39].\nHowever, States should not exceed the limit of self-defense even for nonstate actors. The September 11 attacks against the USA were a clear example of a State invoking the right to self-defense, even when extending the principles of necessity for such defense and the proportionality of the attack. The USA altered its counterterrorism laws to comply with international law when it encouraged the Security Council to adopt Resolution 1373 (2001) [40] on fighting terrorism because it threatens international peace and security. This resolution created normative content on the use of force against nonstate actors (terrorists) located in a sovereign State (in this case, Afghanistan). Moreover, the USA practiced its right of self-defense under international law against a terrorist group called Al-Qaeda in Afghanistan. Although the USA used force against the State of Afghanistan, its intent was to strike nonstate actors located inside the country in response to their attacks against the national security of the USA.\nThe USA, in its right of self-defense, did not follow the rules of a traditional attack, namely, one State against another; by contrast, the USA relied on the CIL and the Law of War to fight the attack by creating new criteria for using force when the attack is perpetrated by nonstate actors, which had not been regulated by traditional international law. Thus, law can be developed over years on the basis of facing new challenges and danger, and the exact example is applicable to today's challenges of cyberattacks, where it can be compared with nonstate actors' cases.\nIn summary, the raising of a State's responsibility for its nonstate actors resulted from its failure to comply with international law and its violation of international rules by allowing nonstate actors to act from its territory to attack another State; [41] compared with a cyberattack, the responsibility raises because the State failed to prevent continued attacks against States and to investigate and prosecute the attackers for their actions within its territory and, finally, when the State failed to implement international law.\n## 4. International attempts to regulate cyberattacks The ICJ recognized in its decision in Nicaragua v. USA that the UN Charter provisions that restrict the use of force in international relations have become the CIL of jus ad bellum [42].\nThus, whether to categorize cyberattacks as a type of jus ad bellum and to create international instruments to govern cyberattacks become pertinent questions.\n## 4.1 Cybercrime Convention by the National Council of Europe The Cybercrime Convention was adopted by the European Council in Budapest in 2001. This convention aimed to create\"criminal policy aimed at the protection of society against cybercrime [...] by adopting appropriate legislation and fostering international cooperation\"[43]. This convention was the first on cybercrimes and cyberattacks through network by collaborating the national laws together, encouraging investigations and increasing international cooperation.\nThe principle aims of the convention are as follows: - harmonize the domestic criminal substantive law elements of offenses and connected provisions in the area of cybercrime; - provide for the domestic criminal procedural law powers necessary for the investigation and prosecution of such offenses as well as other offenses committed by means of a computer system or evidence in relation to which is in electronic form; and - set up a fast, effective regime of international cooperation [44].\nThe convention is the product of four years of work by European and international experts and has been supplemented by an additional protocol that makes any publication of racist, xenophobic propaganda through computer networks a criminal offense, similar to Criminal Libel laws. Currently, cyberterrorism is also studied in the framework of the convention. [45].\n## 4.2 Global program on cybercrime by the United Nations The complexity of the nature of cybercrimes and cyberattacks is from the increasing development of computer information and infrastructure, where perpetrators of those crimes are located worldwide and their crimes are crossing borders without an active international response.\nThe UN has attempted to thwart cyberattacks by adopting the UNGA Resolution 55/63. This resolution calls on Member States to prevent the criminal misuse of information technologies and acknowledge the value of inter alia. The following measures combat such misuse: - States should ensure that their laws and practices eliminate safe havens for individuals who criminally misuse information technologies.\n- Law enforcement cooperation in the investigation and prosecution of international cases of criminal misuse of information technologies should be coordinated among all concerned States.\n- Information should be exchanged between States regarding their problems in combating the criminal misuse of information technologies [46].\nSubsequently, the UNGA adopted Resolution 64/180 [47]. This resolution calls upon the UN Congress on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice to formulate solid suggestions for additional actions, drawing attention to practical arrangements to prevent organized crime and attacks, terrorism, corruption and technical assistance activities relating thereto and requests that the CCPCJ to work with the Economic and Social Council to achieve goals.\nInternational law enforcement Broadly, cybercrime can be described as having cyber-dependent offenses, cyber-enabled offenses and, as a specific crime type, online international attacks. This program is designed to support Member States to prevent and combat cybercrime or international attacks against States in a holistic manner. The main geographic nexus for the Cybercrime Program in 2017 are Central America, Eastern Africa, MENA and East Asia and the Pacific, and the key aims are as follows: Increase efficiency and effectiveness in the investigation, prosecution and adjudication of cybercrime, especially online transnational cyberattacks or human rights abuse.Efficient and effective long-term whole-of-government responses to cybercrime, including national coordination, data collection and effective legal frameworks, leading to a sustainable response and greater deterrence.Strengthen national and international communication between governments, law enforcement and the private sector and increase public knowledge of cybercrime risks [50].\n### Tallinn Manual by NATO Experts at the NATO Cyber Center of Excellence have guided the center to adopt the Tallinn Manual [51], a manual that explains how to apply international law in cases of cyberattacks. This manual collects various CILs and fundamental laws, rules, doctrines and international principles that can govern the cyber conflicts of the international community. The Tallinn Manual highlights eight factors to consider in defining cyber operations: immediacy, presumptive legality, military factors, severity, invasiveness, directness, country involvement and measurability of effects [52]. The IGE, which authored the Tallinn Manual, considered the ICJ's opinions and decisions on the use of force and based the manual on historical materials that have shaped this concept. The Tallinn Manual also covers “hacktivist” groups and a State's responsibility for an attack if such groups use it as a safe haven or if hacktivists are being protected by the State's intelligence agencies or officials [53].\nThe Tallinn Manual aims to set clear standards on situations involving cyber conflicts. For instance, the Tallinn Manual discusses the destruction and physical harm that can result from a cyberattack. According to Rule 13 of the Tallinn Manual [54], destruction or causalities caused by a cyberattack may elevate the attack to a level considered a “use of force”, which is prohibited by international law and the UN Charter [55]. Even if the attacker is a nonstate actor, the victim State may invoke the principle of self-defense under the principles of law, as stated previously [56].\nThus, I suggest that the Tallinn Manual fills the gaps in the international law on cyber conflicts. In general practice, parties refer first to international law and then rely on the Tallinn Manual to interpret the application of law in each case; [57] however, the Tallinn Manual has no jurisdiction over States outside the EU; thus, it creates an international instrument only applicable to cases of cyber. The Tallinn Manual summarizes a State's responsibility if a cyberattack causes a breach in international legal obligations; raises this point, based on the principles of the CIL; [58] and recognizes the responsibility of the agent/s responsible for cyber intrusion into another State. These aspects could lead to prosecution, for example, in the normal exercise of international laws and rules, either by the ICC or by domestic courts.\nNotably, the Tallinn Manual suggests that the term “armed” does not require the existence of weapons; however, it does stipulate that the factors of scale and affect are required to justify the victim State applying the use of force in its self-defense efforts [59]. Eliminating the physical element (i.e. weapons) of the definition of armed means that broadening the interpretation of the term “use of force” would make the application of international laws easier in cases of cyberattacks.\n## 5. Conclusion The frequency of cyberattacks and major information leaks have been increasing annually and attackers use complex ideas, tools and techniques and, in some cases, have received State support. Some attacks affect critical infrastructure and cause major destruction; thus, they pose risks to human lives and create unprecedented data leaks of confidential and classified information that cause mass disorder. The ability to attribute such attacks to States, groups or individuals can have a critical deterrent effect. Reliable identification of the attacker's origin prevents additional attacks from occurring, even if it raises a State's responsibility. This reason is an explanation of why nation-states are highly interested in the attribution of cyberattacks.\nTraditional international law and its provisions for attacks against territorial principles do not cover cyberattacks. Because the internet and cyberspace have neither boundaries nor limits, determining the laws to apply to cyber attackers is difficult. The matter of cyber conflicts raises the issues of aggressor nations, nonstate actors, international responsibility and the principle of self-defense.\nToday, implementing only traditional international law in cases of cyberwarfare is insufficient and the international community must adopt law that regulates and governs cyberspace and cyber conflicts. In addition, clear criteria should apply internationally to develop the CIL to manage the cyber challenges of the 21st century. Recognizing this necessity, some States have adopted measures and binding laws that regulate and categorize cyber conflicts. In many cases, these provisions grant the victim State the right to protect itself against any attack; however, those regulations remain nonbinding, unless an international governance treaty is created in the international community.\nIn conclusion, I have proposed several recommendations that acknowledge the importance of framing the legal instruments of cyberattacks, for example: - Countries should strengthen their cyber laws and cooperate with the international community to fight and establish a legal framework to combat cyberattacks.\n- The continual advancements in the methods used to wage the endemic threat of cyberattacks lead governments to continue to attempt to prevent all types of misuse of computer information and set protections on the internet.\n- Valarie Mac Niven recommends the following: expand the power of domestic law internationally, develop a system to use limited countermeasures where appropriate and apply effective enforcement of cyber laws [60].\n- No consensus exists on the definition of a cyberattack; thus, the international community or the UN must adopt a binding treaty similar to the Tallinn Manual to legally regulate this crime and punish perpetrators of transnational cybercrimes against States.\nJFC 31,5 1062"

Introduction\nIncidences of cyberwars have substantially increased since 1990, turning cyberspace into a battlefield on which all nations must fight. Cyberattacks have been recognized as an international problem, and in 2018, this concern became a top global threat . For many countries, cyberattacks and conflicts, and even the basic operation of cyberspace, are new concerns. In addition, because of the novelty of cyber in general, today's international law fails to adequately regulate cyberwarfare.\nTo discuss the management of the dilemma of cyberspace operations, cyberattack must be defined. Moreover, for States to use force in cyberwarfare, whether the right to use force exists under Article 51 of the United Nations (UN) Charter must be determined. To address these two concerns, whether cyberwarfare is under international law or domestic law must also be determined.\nThus, allowing a State to use force against cyberattacks should be justified under international law by assessing the aggressor State's responsibility. However, acknowledging any State's responsibility for a cyber intrusion has proven to be difficult, especially if the State depends on nonstate actors to launch a cyberattack against the victim State.\nIn this article, I analyze the aforementioned aspects of cyberattacks. In Part I, I conduct a comparison between a cyberattack as a domestic crime addressed under domestic laws and\nJournal of Financial Crime Vol. 31 No. 5, 2024 pp. 1052-1066 © Emerald Publishing Limited 1359-0790 DOI 10.1108/JFC-07-2023-0164\nas an international crime addressed under international laws. In Part II, I apply international law to cyberattacks. Finally, in Part III, I discuss committing cyberattacks by states and nonstate actors.\n## Cyberattacks as a domestic or international crime\nA principal challenge to managing cyberattacks is the difficulty of proving that the event occurred and if so, who perpetrated it. Today's internet is in a constant, intense state of major development and it is almost impossible to establish internet boundaries between countries or to prove any party or State committed a cyberattack. Thus, the challenge is to evaluate whether the perpetrator of the cyberattack is domestic, international or a combination of the two, to apply the applicable law and determine whether the attacks can be considered under the Law of War.\nThus, I first define the meaning of cyberattack and then observe the purpose and the results of this type of attack, committed by a State or nonstate actors and whether it is under the State's sovereignty or has crossed its borders.\n### Definition of cyberattacks\nThe main aim of a cyberattack is to destroy computer systems of companies, institutions, ministries and other important landmarks of a State and the main focus is on confidential information stored in computers. Stamatis Karnouskos described a cyberattack as follows: acts that usually originate from an unidentified source, individuals or organizations, to attack an operational system to withdraw information for purpose of stealing, destroying or altering a specified target by hacking into the susceptible system .\nNo clear definition of computer crimes has been provided because of its multiple categories, for example, the employment of computer network operations with the intent to deny adversaries the effective use of their computers, information systems and networks while ensuring the effective use of our own computers, information systems and networks. These operations include computer network attack, computer network exploration and computer network defense . Thus, many institutions have attempted to define such crimes.\nStates have different definitions of cyberattack, for example, the USA, Russia and China. The US National Research Council defines individuals or organizations as “deliberate actions to alter, disrupt, deceive, degrade, or destroy computer systems or networks or the information and/or programs resident in or transiting these systems or networks” . Notably, to avoid misunderstandings, ambiguity or gaps, this definition makes no distinction between cyberattacks and cybercrimes. By contrast, China and Russia's definition of a cyberattack focus on the free use of technology. The Shanghai Cooperation Organization  -- a political, economic and security alliance created by China, Russia, Iran, Indian, Pakistan and some of the former States of the Soviet Union -- defines a cyberattack as “mass psychological brainwashing to destabilize society and state, as well as to force the state to take decisions in the interest of an opposing party” .\nThe increasing number of cyberattacks and their effects on States have become top national security concerns and the UN has proposed a plan to help. The UN plan attempts to address the most urgent shortcomings in information security and define sustainable medium-term and long-term strategies for information security for the international community .\nThe European Union's (EU) definition of a cyberattack recognizes these events as a source of disruption, conflict and geopolitical rivalries and says that “deliberate activities to disrupt or destroy computer systems and networks. Cyber-deterrence refers to measures for\ndissuading potential perpetrators through robust systems, sanctions mechanisms and cyber-diplomacy” .\nThe literature has attempted to define a cyberattack. Junaidu Marshall and Muazu Saulawa defined a cyberattack as:“Deliberate exploitation of computer systems, technology-dependent enterprises and networks. Cyberattacks use malicious code to alter computer code, logic or data, resulting in disruptive consequences that can compromise data and lead to cybercrimes, such as information and identity theft .”Others  attempted to distinguish the purpose of a cyberattack by analyzing the motive, opportunity and methods used in the attack. All those factors affect the result of cyberattacks and hence indicate the applicable law, namely, domestic or international.\n### 2.2 Law applicable to cyberattacks\nThe legal definition of cyberwarfare and whether it is applicable under the current Law of War in international law or has another status that should be applied under domestic laws has not been determined. Thus, whether special international criminal law should be applied to cyberattacks and whether framing this type of attack through international treaties is appropriate ought to be determined. Currently, no comprehensive international treaty or convention exists to regulate cyberattacks . Consequently, States have been using traditional methods to practice law, either by considering the event an international attack and responding to it under the Law of War or by acknowledging it as a criminal activity and prosecuting it under domestic criminal law.\nScholars such as Heather Dinniss, Francesca Spidalieri and Susan Brenner  have classified a cyberattack as a criminal act under domestic law for the following reasons: the difficulty of identifying the perpetrator and whether a State was the perpetrator; the uncertainty of whether a cyberattack can be legally considered an armed attack to which international law and the Law of War are applicable and whether the resulting damage or harm is similar to that caused by a traditional attack; and the right to use force for self-defense requires a physical attack by one State against another under the Law of War. Therefore, based on their reasons, applying domestic criminal law in cyberattack situations might be favorable.\nBy contrast, scholars such as Jeffery Carr, Louise Arimatsu and Joanna Kulesza  have classified cyberattacks under international law and Customary International Law (CIL). I support this perspective for several reasons. First, because attacking a State's infrastructure may cause as much harm and damage as an armed attack, applying domestic law would prevent the State from exercising its right of self-defense under international law, which is binding on other States. Second, applying domestic criminal law in such a case is ineffective because some States may refuse to extradite or prosecute the attackers under another State's law, which they (i.e. States and attackers) are not bound by. Third, organizing a cyberattack under international law would provide States legal cover when solving issues in international relations; by relying on the sovereign equality principle  between States, States can solve such issues in an equal, effective manner under the supervision of the international community, the UN and the Security Council.\nCyberattacks raise more challenges in enforcing the law because they are an unusual type of attack with an impact that may cross the border of a single State and may damage another State. Such cross-border damage may threaten international peace and security, violate the UN Charter and therefore transform into an international issue that should be\nInternational law enforcement\n1055\nresolved by international law rather than domestic law, which may not be binding on attackers from another State or raise the State's responsibility internationally.\nMoreover, although the classification of a cyberattack as an international attack rather than domestic attack can be based on responsibility, proving that the attack source was from another State either raises its responsibility before international law or the State will be responsible for the acts of the nonstate actors who initiated the attack from its territory because if the attackers acted within the State's borders to cause an attack, domestic criminal law is applicable because those attackers are criminals.\nTherefore, categorizing cyberattacks as domestic crimes would cause problems in applying protections to States' sovereignty in international law or in passive defense, which means preemptive protection of States, because States would have difficulty reducing the number of attacks launched from computers against its infrastructure by depending on a passive defense. Notably, a more efficient perspective is to consider a cyberattack an international crime because criminal law has been insufficiently effective at preventing cyberattacks, for example, some States, such as Russia and China, have not prosecuted their attackers for cybercrimes committed against other States, whether the attackers were located within their borders or attackers used by them .\n## 3. Implementation of international law on cyberattacks\nCyberattacks are a new form of conflict. The main purpose of cyberattacks is to undermine the functions of computers and to destroy their infrastructure and networks to disrupt the communications of, for example, a company or a country. To use force under Article 39 or Article 51 of the UN Charter, there must be a \"threat to international peace and security, breach of peace or act of aggression\". Accordingly, the question becomes whether a cyberattack is a breach of peace or an act of aggression. Thus, by understanding the definition of cyber (not actual or physical) attacks, the critical question is whether international law can regulate cyberwarfare. This question is, especially, relevant because no conventions on cyberwarfare have been established.\nA comparison between the effects of an armed attack and a cyberattack can be considered from many perspectives. First, by analyzing the \"instrument approach\" , which means if the instrument used in a cyberattack can cause damage similar to the damage caused by instruments used in a kinetic attack, a cyberattack can be characterized as an armed attack, which is an act of aggression that allows the use of force. Such an act would be, for instance, using the internet to blockade a city by shutting down its power grid, because in a kinetic case, the power grid would be bombed by using more kinetic means to cause the same result.\nSecond, analyzing the \"consequences\" of the attack  can occur when the results of a cyberattack can be similarly achieved by a kinetic attack, that is, the harm and damage to a State's sovereignty or its infrastructure would be the same in both cases. Consequently, the attack has achieved the core of aggression prohibited by international law. For instance, attacking the system that operates oil wells and preventing their operation would cause the same consequences as bombing the same system, because the result of shutting down oil distribution would be the same. For example, in 2012, Iran fomented a cyberattack against one of the largest oil companies in the world, Aramco, which is owned by Saudi Arabia, by releasing the Shamoon virus. This virus caused massive damage to more than 30,000 computers within Aramco's infrastructure, which destroyed operations and business proceedings for nearly two weeks  and caused Saudi Arabia to suffer substantial financial losses.\nJFC 31,5\n1056\nThird, an analysis would be conducted on the “direct liability” that may cause severe damage against the State’s infrastructure system in the same manner that may result from an armed attack, which raises the responsibility of the aggressor State .\nTherefore, to rely on international law to justify the use of countermeasures against a cyberattack, the damage or harm that the attack caused should be equal to that caused by a physical armed attack against which the victim State would respond to protect itself (i.e. the principle of self-defense) .\nInternational relations should be built on good faith and each nation should respect the internal affairs of other nations . Otherwise, the aggressor State would be in violation of international law principles and would be attacking another State even if the attack was a cyberattack. A clear example of breaching the nonintervention principle occurred in 2007 when Russia perpetrated a cyberattack against Estonia, described as the most famous wide-range cyberattack. The duration of Russia’s cyberattack was three weeks and caused significant damage to Estonia’s electronics and telecommunication infrastructure. Apparently, the attack was in retaliation for the Estonian Government’s decision to remove a Russian monument from the center of an Estonian city, despite the threats from Russia. However, Russia’s international responsibility for committing this act of aggression against Estonia was never raised, because it was never acknowledged .\nAccordingly, a cyberattack can constitute an armed attack that causes the prohibited crime of aggression, raising the responsibility of the aggressor State and allowing the victim State to use force under Article 39 by gaining Security Council authorization.\n## 3.1 State responsibility cyberattacks\nThe concept of a State’s responsibility has been a base for international security, especially because many conflicts have arisen because of sovereignty issues. The question I attempt to answer in this section is what may raise a State’s responsibility for its actions? Due to violations of international law principles and another State’s sovereignty, the victim State may use legal measures to defend itself against any attack, cyber or kinetic, and such a matter obtains its legitimacy directly from Jus Cogen principles.\nThe speed of the growth of cyberattacks is making it difficult to track perpetrators, namely, nations and terrorists. Therefore, to raise a State’s responsibility, the attack must be proven to have been committed by the aggressor State. One of the difficulties in this matter is to prove who committed the cyberattack. In the early days of the internet, there was a unique IP address, an electronic address used to connect a user to the internet, which would indisputably identify the user to which it was assigned. Today, however, IP addresses are increasingly difficult to identify because users can now change their IP addresses and/or the location (e.g. country) in which the IP address is active. Thus, an agent located in State A can commit an attack against State B under an IP address from a State C, despite the agent’s location being State A.\nFor these reasons, the aggressor State must contribute to a cross-border cyberattack by allowing its agent to use passive measures to attack another State’s computer system to cause massive damage, which allows the victim State to use its right to defend itself against such an intrusion when the cyberattack is raised to the level of an armed attack. Thus, for those reasons, David Graham said:\nStates acting on the perceived legal requirement that they must conclusively attribute a cyberattack to another State or its agents historically have chosen to respond to cross-border cyberattacks as they would to criminal matters, employing only “passive” (computer security) measures to and urging the States from which the attacks originated to investigate and prosecute those responsible .\nJus ad bellum follows international law in its implementation and thus might also be applicable to cyber conflicts. Harold Koh stated that international law applies to cyberspace issues; however, each case should be considered individually because not all cases may justify the implementation of traditional law . With the development of technology, international law should also be developed. New challenges and new cybertechnology should be considered, especially when relying on the CIL, where States start acting against new threats by creating new customary principles that reshape international law , to develop and govern the challenges and technology in this century, where the traditional Law of War is ineffective.\nThe international responsibility borne by a State for a wrongful act falls under jus in bello. The State is also responsible for the actions of agents under its direct control and in guiding them to attack other States , a rule adopted by the ICJ and the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia . In other words, a State is responsible for implementing all measures to prevent individuals or groups from attacking other countries if they are acting solely without instruction from the State from which they are acting; otherwise, the State will have more responsibility for the attack. Thus, if a country takes all necessary measures to fight terrorist groups or hackers, it would be exempt from responsibility for a cyberattack perpetrated from within its borders against another (victim) State in the eyes of the international community and the victim State.\nIn supporting this concept, I must note that the idea of international responsibility does not apply to cyberattacks attributed to States only but also to nonstate actors (e.g. hackers and terrorists) who use the State's territory to attack another State.\n### 3.2 Nonstate actors' responsibility for a cyberattack\nTo establish such responsibility, I distinguish between cyberterrorism and cybercrime . Cyberterrorism is committed by terrorists who use computer technology to apply their activities and are internationally motivated by political issues. Cybercrime is committed by hackers using internet technology to apply personal activities, such as manipulating a bank security system to steal money.\nDetermining the physical location to determine the responsibility of an attacker is normally a critical step to reliably establish his/her identity. Only by tracing the base computer where the virus was launched, its would be easy to identify the attacker and he/she can be verified; thus, tracking is possible. Often, however, this endeavor is not possible without the support of law enforcement agencies in the same State where the attacker launched the attack, which is less likely to occur in the case of a nation State-operated attack by its agents or supported hackers. For instance, breaking the chain of the network worm released at the Olympic Winter Games opening ceremony in Pyeongchang, South Korea, in 2018, was difficult. This malware was linked to other targeted attack groups known to have attacked other locations. These links led to confusion across the InfoSec industry in their attempts to assign attribution to the attacks because the attackers continually changed addresses and info flags .\nThe role of the State in adopting laws and imposing sanctions on these acts is notable. Many States, such as Kuwait, Jordan , the UAE , Germany , the UK  and the USA , have adopted cyber and electronic criminal law to prosecute such crimes and increase the punishments, to prevent hackers of nonstate actors from committing cybercrimes or attacks. For instance, Kuwaiti law prohibits unlawful access to a computer, its system, an electronic data processing system, an automated electronic system or an information network if this entry entails the abolition, deletion, destruction, disclosure,\nJFC 31,5\n1058\nalteration or republication of data or information . This example demonstrates how States have attempted to add cybercrimes to their domestic laws.\nIn addition, even if the attacker is a nonstate actor, the victim State may invoke the principle of self-defense under the principles of law . In other words, if a cyberattack causes damage that approaches the equivalence of damage caused by an armed attack, the principle of self-defense applies to the victim State. However, the victim State may not act in self-defense if the cyber attacker acted without the support of the country in which he/she resided (or from which he/she perpetrated the attack). Thus, proof must be provided that the host State collaborated with the cybercriminal to attack the victim country to permit it (the victim country) to raise the international responsibility to invoke the right of self-defense defined in the UN Charter .\nMany substantial modifications have been applied to assure a State's responsibility for the actions of nonstate actors. Notably, an opinion of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia in the Tadic case  states that the State will be held responsible for supporting, planning or assisting groups' actions against another State. Thus, as long as the proof of the connection between the two is clear, international responsibility is established. Moreover, this creates a criterion in international responsibility when shifting between effective control (the State's responsibility) to overall control (State and nonstate actors' responsibility), which allows in both cases for the victim State to use force to defend itself .\nHowever, States should not exceed the limit of self-defense even for nonstate actors. The September 11 attacks against the USA were a clear example of a State invoking the right to self-defense, even when extending the principles of necessity for such defense and the proportionality of the attack. The USA altered its counterterrorism laws to comply with international law when it encouraged the Security Council to adopt Resolution 1373 (2001)  on fighting terrorism because it threatens international peace and security. This resolution created normative content on the use of force against nonstate actors (terrorists) located in a sovereign State (in this case, Afghanistan). Moreover, the USA practiced its right of self-defense under international law against a terrorist group called Al-Qaeda in Afghanistan. Although the USA used force against the State of Afghanistan, its intent was to strike nonstate actors located inside the country in response to their attacks against the national security of the USA.\nThe USA, in its right of self-defense, did not follow the rules of a traditional attack, namely, one State against another; by contrast, the USA relied on the CIL and the Law of War to fight the attack by creating new criteria for using force when the attack is perpetrated by nonstate actors, which had not been regulated by traditional international law. Thus, law can be developed over years on the basis of facing new challenges and danger, and the exact example is applicable to today's challenges of cyberattacks, where it can be compared with nonstate actors' cases.\nIn summary, the raising of a State's responsibility for its nonstate actors resulted from its failure to comply with international law and its violation of international rules by allowing nonstate actors to act from its territory to attack another State;  compared with a cyberattack, the responsibility raises because the State failed to prevent continued attacks against States and to investigate and prosecute the attackers for their actions within its territory and, finally, when the State failed to implement international law.\n## 4. International attempts to regulate cyberattacks\nThe ICJ recognized in its decision in Nicaragua v. USA that the UN Charter provisions that restrict the use of force in international relations have become the CIL of jus ad bellum .\nThus, whether to categorize cyberattacks as a type of jus ad bellum and to create international instruments to govern cyberattacks become pertinent questions.\n## 4.1 Cybercrime Convention by the National Council of Europe\nThe Cybercrime Convention was adopted by the European Council in Budapest in 2001. This convention aimed to create \"criminal policy aimed at the protection of society against cybercrime [...] by adopting appropriate legislation and fostering international cooperation\" . This convention was the first on cybercrimes and cyberattacks through network by collaborating the national laws together, encouraging investigations and increasing international cooperation.\nThe principle aims of the convention are as follows:\n- harmonize the domestic criminal substantive law elements of offenses and connected provisions in the area of cybercrime;\n- provide for the domestic criminal procedural law powers necessary for the investigation and prosecution of such offenses as well as other offenses committed by means of a computer system or evidence in relation to which is in electronic form; and\n- set up a fast, effective regime of international cooperation .\nThe convention is the product of four years of work by European and international experts and has been supplemented by an additional protocol that makes any publication of racist, xenophobic propaganda through computer networks a criminal offense, similar to Criminal Libel laws. Currently, cyberterrorism is also studied in the framework of the convention. .\n## 4.2 Global program on cybercrime by the United Nations\nThe complexity of the nature of cybercrimes and cyberattacks is from the increasing development of computer information and infrastructure, where perpetrators of those crimes are located worldwide and their crimes are crossing borders without an active international response.\nThe UN has attempted to thwart cyberattacks by adopting the UNGA Resolution 55/63. This resolution calls on Member States to prevent the criminal misuse of information technologies and acknowledge the value of inter alia. The following measures combat such misuse:\n- States should ensure that their laws and practices eliminate safe havens for individuals who criminally misuse information technologies.\n- Law enforcement cooperation in the investigation and prosecution of international cases of criminal misuse of information technologies should be coordinated among all concerned States.\n- Information should be exchanged between States regarding their problems in combating the criminal misuse of information technologies .\nSubsequently, the UNGA adopted Resolution 64/180 . This resolution calls upon the UN Congress on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice to formulate solid suggestions for additional actions, drawing attention to practical arrangements to prevent organized crime and attacks, terrorism, corruption and technical assistance activities relating thereto and requests that the CCPCJ to work with the Economic and Social Council to achieve goals.\nInternational law enforcement\n1059\nMoreover, the UNGA adopted Resolution 65/230 , supporting the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Resolutions 22/7 and 22/8 , to assist Member States in their struggles and obstacles in preventing cyberattacks and to encourage cooperation in implementing international legal instruments pertaining to transnational organized cyberattacks.\nBroadly, cybercrime can be described as having cyber-dependent offenses, cyber-enabled offenses and, as a specific crime type, online international attacks. This program is designed to support Member States to prevent and combat cybercrime or international attacks against States in a holistic manner. The main geographic nexus for the Cybercrime Program in 2017 are Central America, Eastern Africa, MENA and East Asia and the Pacific, and the key aims are as follows: Increase efficiency and effectiveness in the investigation, prosecution and adjudication of cybercrime, especially online transnational cyberattacks or human rights abuse.Efficient and effective long-term whole-of-government responses to cybercrime, including national coordination, data collection and effective legal frameworks, leading to a sustainable response and greater deterrence.Strengthen national and international communication between governments, law enforcement and the private sector and increase public knowledge of cybercrime risks .\n### Tallinn Manual by NATO\nExperts at the NATO Cyber Center of Excellence have guided the center to adopt the Tallinn Manual , a manual that explains how to apply international law in cases of cyberattacks. This manual collects various CILs and fundamental laws, rules, doctrines and international principles that can govern the cyber conflicts of the international community. The Tallinn Manual highlights eight factors to consider in defining cyber operations: immediacy, presumptive legality, military factors, severity, invasiveness, directness, country involvement and measurability of effects . The IGE, which authored the Tallinn Manual, considered the ICJ's opinions and decisions on the use of force and based the manual on historical materials that have shaped this concept. The Tallinn Manual also covers “hacktivist” groups and a State's responsibility for an attack if such groups use it as a safe haven or if hacktivists are being protected by the State's intelligence agencies or officials .\nThe Tallinn Manual aims to set clear standards on situations involving cyber conflicts. For instance, the Tallinn Manual discusses the destruction and physical harm that can result from a cyberattack. According to Rule 13 of the Tallinn Manual , destruction or causalities caused by a cyberattack may elevate the attack to a level considered a “use of force”, which is prohibited by international law and the UN Charter . Even if the attacker is a nonstate actor, the victim State may invoke the principle of self-defense under the principles of law, as stated previously .\nThus, I suggest that the Tallinn Manual fills the gaps in the international law on cyber conflicts. In general practice, parties refer first to international law and then rely on the Tallinn Manual to interpret the application of law in each case;  however, the Tallinn Manual has no jurisdiction over States outside the EU; thus, it creates an international instrument only applicable to cases of cyber. The Tallinn Manual summarizes a State's responsibility if a cyberattack causes a breach in international legal obligations; raises this\npoint, based on the principles of the CIL;  and recognizes the responsibility of the agent/s responsible for cyber intrusion into another State. These aspects could lead to prosecution, for example, in the normal exercise of international laws and rules, either by the ICC or by domestic courts.\nNotably, the Tallinn Manual suggests that the term “armed” does not require the existence of weapons; however, it does stipulate that the factors of scale and affect are required to justify the victim State applying the use of force in its self-defense efforts . Eliminating the physical element (i.e. weapons) of the definition of armed means that broadening the interpretation of the term “use of force” would make the application of international laws easier in cases of cyberattacks.\n## 5. Conclusion\nThe frequency of cyberattacks and major information leaks have been increasing annually and attackers use complex ideas, tools and techniques and, in some cases, have received State support. Some attacks affect critical infrastructure and cause major destruction; thus, they pose risks to human lives and create unprecedented data leaks of confidential and classified information that cause mass disorder. The ability to attribute such attacks to States, groups or individuals can have a critical deterrent effect. Reliable identification of the attacker's origin prevents additional attacks from occurring, even if it raises a State's responsibility. This reason is an explanation of why nation-states are highly interested in the attribution of cyberattacks.\nTraditional international law and its provisions for attacks against territorial principles do not cover cyberattacks. Because the internet and cyberspace have neither boundaries nor limits, determining the laws to apply to cyber attackers is difficult. The matter of cyber conflicts raises the issues of aggressor nations, nonstate actors, international responsibility and the principle of self-defense.\nToday, implementing only traditional international law in cases of cyberwarfare is insufficient and the international community must adopt law that regulates and governs cyberspace and cyber conflicts. In addition, clear criteria should apply internationally to develop the CIL to manage the cyber challenges of the 21st century. Recognizing this necessity, some States have adopted measures and binding laws that regulate and categorize cyber conflicts. In many cases, these provisions grant the victim State the right to protect itself against any attack; however, those regulations remain nonbinding, unless an international governance treaty is created in the international community.\nIn conclusion, I have proposed several recommendations that acknowledge the importance of framing the legal instruments of cyberattacks, for example:\n- Countries should strengthen their cyber laws and cooperate with the international community to fight and establish a legal framework to combat cyberattacks.\n- The continual advancements in the methods used to wage the endemic threat of cyberattacks lead governments to continue to attempt to prevent all types of misuse of computer information and set protections on the internet.\n- Valarie Mac Niven recommends the following: expand the power of domestic law internationally, develop a system to use limited countermeasures where appropriate and apply effective enforcement of cyber laws .\n- No consensus exists on the definition of a cyberattack; thus, the international community or the UN must adopt a binding treaty similar to the Tallinn Manual to legally regulate this crime and punish perpetrators of transnational cybercrimes against States.\nJFC 31,5\n1062"

Introduction Incidences of cyberwars have substantially increased since 1990, turning cyberspace into a battlefield on which all nations must fight. Cyberattacks have been recognized as an international problem, and in 2018, this concern became a top global threat [1]. For many countries, cyberattacks and conflicts, and even the basic operation of cyberspace, are new concerns. In addition, because of the novelty of cyber in general, today's international law fails to adequately regulate cyberwarfare.\nTo discuss the management of the dilemma of cyberspace operations, cyberattack must be defined. Moreover, for States to use force in cyberwarfare, whether the right to use force exists under Article 51 of the United Nations (UN) Charter must be determined. To address these two concerns, whether cyberwarfare is under international law or domestic law must also be determined.\nThus, allowing a State to use force against cyberattacks should be justified under international law by assessing the aggressor State's responsibility. However, acknowledging any State's responsibility for a cyber intrusion has proven to be difficult, especially if the State depends on nonstate actors to launch a cyberattack against the victim State.\nIn this article, I analyze the aforementioned aspects of cyberattacks. In Part I, I conduct a comparison between a cyberattack as a domestic crime addressed under domestic laws and Journal of Financial Crime Vol. 31 No. 5, 2024 pp. 1052-1066 © Emerald Publishing Limited 1359-0790 DOI 10.1108/JFC-07-2023-0164 as an international crime addressed under international laws. In Part II, I apply international law to cyberattacks. Finally, in Part III, I discuss committing cyberattacks by states and nonstate actors.\n## Cyberattacks as a domestic or international crime A principal challenge to managing cyberattacks is the difficulty of proving that the event occurred and if so, who perpetrated it. Today's internet is in a constant, intense state of major development and it is almost impossible to establish internet boundaries between countries or to prove any party or State committed a cyberattack. Thus, the challenge is to evaluate whether the perpetrator of the cyberattack is domestic, international or a combination of the two, to apply the applicable law and determine whether the attacks can be considered under the Law of War.\nThus, I first define the meaning of cyberattack and then observe the purpose and the results of this type of attack, committed by a State or nonstate actors and whether it is under the State's sovereignty or has crossed its borders.\n### Definition of cyberattacks The main aim of a cyberattack is to destroy computer systems of companies, institutions, ministries and other important landmarks of a State and the main focus is on confidential information stored in computers. Stamatis Karnouskos described a cyberattack as follows: acts that usually originate from an unidentified source, individuals or organizations, to attack an operational system to withdraw information for purpose of stealing, destroying or altering a specified target by hacking into the susceptible system [2].\nNo clear definition of computer crimes has been provided because of its multiple categories, for example, the employment of computer network operations with the intent to deny adversaries the effective use of their computers, information systems and networks while ensuring the effective use of our own computers, information systems and networks. These operations include computer network attack, computer network exploration and computer network defense [3]. Thus, many institutions have attempted to define such crimes.\nStates have different definitions of cyberattack, for example, the USA, Russia and China. The US National Research Council defines individuals or organizations as “deliberate actions to alter, disrupt, deceive, degrade, or destroy computer systems or networks or the information and/or programs resident in or transiting these systems or networks” [4]. Notably, to avoid misunderstandings, ambiguity or gaps, this definition makes no distinction between cyberattacks and cybercrimes. By contrast, China and Russia's definition of a cyberattack focus on the free use of technology. The Shanghai Cooperation Organization [5] -- a political, economic and security alliance created by China, Russia, Iran, Indian, Pakistan and some of the former States of the Soviet Union -- defines a cyberattack as “mass psychological brainwashing to destabilize society and state, as well as to force the state to take decisions in the interest of an opposing party” [6].\nThe increasing number of cyberattacks and their effects on States have become top national security concerns and the UN has proposed a plan to help. The UN plan attempts to address the most urgent shortcomings in information security and define sustainable medium-term and long-term strategies for information security for the international community [7].\nThe European Union's (EU) definition of a cyberattack recognizes these events as a source of disruption, conflict and geopolitical rivalries and says that “deliberate activities to disrupt or destroy computer systems and networks. Cyber-deterrence refers to measures for dissuading potential perpetrators through robust systems, sanctions mechanisms and cyber-diplomacy” [8].\nThe literature has attempted to define a cyberattack. Junaidu Marshall and Muazu Saulawa defined a cyberattack as:“Deliberate exploitation of computer systems, technology-dependent enterprises and networks. Cyberattacks use malicious code to alter computer code, logic or data, resulting in disruptive consequences that can compromise data and lead to cybercrimes, such as information and identity theft [9].”Others [10] attempted to distinguish the purpose of a cyberattack by analyzing the motive, opportunity and methods used in the attack. All those factors affect the result of cyberattacks and hence indicate the applicable law, namely, domestic or international.\n### 2.2 Law applicable to cyberattacks The legal definition of cyberwarfare and whether it is applicable under the current Law of War in international law or has another status that should be applied under domestic laws has not been determined. Thus, whether special international criminal law should be applied to cyberattacks and whether framing this type of attack through international treaties is appropriate ought to be determined. Currently, no comprehensive international treaty or convention exists to regulate cyberattacks [11]. Consequently, States have been using traditional methods to practice law, either by considering the event an international attack and responding to it under the Law of War or by acknowledging it as a criminal activity and prosecuting it under domestic criminal law.\nScholars such as Heather Dinniss, Francesca Spidalieri and Susan Brenner [12] have classified a cyberattack as a criminal act under domestic law for the following reasons: the difficulty of identifying the perpetrator and whether a State was the perpetrator; the uncertainty of whether a cyberattack can be legally considered an armed attack to which international law and the Law of War are applicable and whether the resulting damage or harm is similar to that caused by a traditional attack; and the right to use force for self-defense requires a physical attack by one State against another under the Law of War. Therefore, based on their reasons, applying domestic criminal law in cyberattack situations might be favorable.\nBy contrast, scholars such as Jeffery Carr, Louise Arimatsu and Joanna Kulesza [13] have classified cyberattacks under international law and Customary International Law (CIL). I support this perspective for several reasons. First, because attacking a State's infrastructure may cause as much harm and damage as an armed attack, applying domestic law would prevent the State from exercising its right of self-defense under international law, which is binding on other States. Second, applying domestic criminal law in such a case is ineffective because some States may refuse to extradite or prosecute the attackers under another State's law, which they (i.e. States and attackers) are not bound by. Third, organizing a cyberattack under international law would provide States legal cover when solving issues in international relations; by relying on the sovereign equality principle [14] between States, States can solve such issues in an equal, effective manner under the supervision of the international community, the UN and the Security Council.\nCyberattacks raise more challenges in enforcing the law because they are an unusual type of attack with an impact that may cross the border of a single State and may damage another State. Such cross-border damage may threaten international peace and security, violate the UN Charter and therefore transform into an international issue that should be International law enforcement Moreover, although the classification of a cyberattack as an international attack rather than domestic attack can be based on responsibility, proving that the attack source was from another State either raises its responsibility before international law or the State will be responsible for the acts of the nonstate actors who initiated the attack from its territory because if the attackers acted within the State's borders to cause an attack, domestic criminal law is applicable because those attackers are criminals.\nTherefore, categorizing cyberattacks as domestic crimes would cause problems in applying protections to States' sovereignty in international law or in passive defense, which means preemptive protection of States, because States would have difficulty reducing the number of attacks launched from computers against its infrastructure by depending on a passive defense. Notably, a more efficient perspective is to consider a cyberattack an international crime because criminal law has been insufficiently effective at preventing cyberattacks, for example, some States, such as Russia and China, have not prosecuted their attackers for cybercrimes committed against other States, whether the attackers were located within their borders or attackers used by them [15].\n## 3. Implementation of international law on cyberattacks Cyberattacks are a new form of conflict. The main purpose of cyberattacks is to undermine the functions of computers and to destroy their infrastructure and networks to disrupt the communications of, for example, a company or a country. To use force under Article 39 or Article 51 of the UN Charter, there must be a\"threat to international peace and security, breach of peace or act of aggression\". Accordingly, the question becomes whether a cyberattack is a breach of peace or an act of aggression. Thus, by understanding the definition of cyber (not actual or physical) attacks, the critical question is whether international law can regulate cyberwarfare. This question is, especially, relevant because no conventions on cyberwarfare have been established.\nA comparison between the effects of an armed attack and a cyberattack can be considered from many perspectives. First, by analyzing the\"instrument approach\"[16], which means if the instrument used in a cyberattack can cause damage similar to the damage caused by instruments used in a kinetic attack, a cyberattack can be characterized as an armed attack, which is an act of aggression that allows the use of force. Such an act would be, for instance, using the internet to blockade a city by shutting down its power grid, because in a kinetic case, the power grid would be bombed by using more kinetic means to cause the same result.\nSecond, analyzing the\"consequences\"of the attack [17] can occur when the results of a cyberattack can be similarly achieved by a kinetic attack, that is, the harm and damage to a State's sovereignty or its infrastructure would be the same in both cases. Consequently, the attack has achieved the core of aggression prohibited by international law. For instance, attacking the system that operates oil wells and preventing their operation would cause the same consequences as bombing the same system, because the result of shutting down oil distribution would be the same. For example, in 2012, Iran fomented a cyberattack against one of the largest oil companies in the world, Aramco, which is owned by Saudi Arabia, by releasing the Shamoon virus. This virus caused massive damage to more than 30,000 computers within Aramco's infrastructure, which destroyed operations and business proceedings for nearly two weeks [18] and caused Saudi Arabia to suffer substantial financial losses.\nJFC 31,5 Therefore, to rely on international law to justify the use of countermeasures against a cyberattack, the damage or harm that the attack caused should be equal to that caused by a physical armed attack against which the victim State would respond to protect itself (i.e. the principle of self-defense) [20].\nInternational relations should be built on good faith and each nation should respect the internal affairs of other nations [21]. Otherwise, the aggressor State would be in violation of international law principles and would be attacking another State even if the attack was a cyberattack. A clear example of breaching the nonintervention principle occurred in 2007 when Russia perpetrated a cyberattack against Estonia, described as the most famous wide-range cyberattack. The duration of Russia’s cyberattack was three weeks and caused significant damage to Estonia’s electronics and telecommunication infrastructure. Apparently, the attack was in retaliation for the Estonian Government’s decision to remove a Russian monument from the center of an Estonian city, despite the threats from Russia. However, Russia’s international responsibility for committing this act of aggression against Estonia was never raised, because it was never acknowledged [22].\nAccordingly, a cyberattack can constitute an armed attack that causes the prohibited crime of aggression, raising the responsibility of the aggressor State and allowing the victim State to use force under Article 39 by gaining Security Council authorization.\n## 3.1 State responsibility cyberattacks The concept of a State’s responsibility has been a base for international security, especially because many conflicts have arisen because of sovereignty issues. The question I attempt to answer in this section is what may raise a State’s responsibility for its actions? Due to violations of international law principles and another State’s sovereignty, the victim State may use legal measures to defend itself against any attack, cyber or kinetic, and such a matter obtains its legitimacy directly from Jus Cogen principles.\nThe speed of the growth of cyberattacks is making it difficult to track perpetrators, namely, nations and terrorists. Therefore, to raise a State’s responsibility, the attack must be proven to have been committed by the aggressor State. One of the difficulties in this matter is to prove who committed the cyberattack. In the early days of the internet, there was a unique IP address, an electronic address used to connect a user to the internet, which would indisputably identify the user to which it was assigned. Today, however, IP addresses are increasingly difficult to identify because users can now change their IP addresses and/or the location (e.g. country) in which the IP address is active. Thus, an agent located in State A can commit an attack against State B under an IP address from a State C, despite the agent’s location being State A.\nFor these reasons, the aggressor State must contribute to a cross-border cyberattack by allowing its agent to use passive measures to attack another State’s computer system to cause massive damage, which allows the victim State to use its right to defend itself against such an intrusion when the cyberattack is raised to the level of an armed attack. Thus, for those reasons, David Graham said: States acting on the perceived legal requirement that they must conclusively attribute a cyberattack to another State or its agents historically have chosen to respond to cross-border cyberattacks as they would to criminal matters, employing only “passive” (computer security) measures to and urging the States from which the attacks originated to investigate and prosecute those responsible [23].\nJus ad bellum follows international law in its implementation and thus might also be applicable to cyber conflicts. Harold Koh stated that international law applies to cyberspace issues; however, each case should be considered individually because not all cases may justify the implementation of traditional law [24]. With the development of technology, international law should also be developed. New challenges and new cybertechnology should be considered, especially when relying on the CIL, where States start acting against new threats by creating new customary principles that reshape international law [25], to develop and govern the challenges and technology in this century, where the traditional Law of War is ineffective.\nThe international responsibility borne by a State for a wrongful act falls under jus in bello. The State is also responsible for the actions of agents under its direct control and in guiding them to attack other States [26], a rule adopted by the ICJ and the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia [27]. In other words, a State is responsible for implementing all measures to prevent individuals or groups from attacking other countries if they are acting solely without instruction from the State from which they are acting; otherwise, the State will have more responsibility for the attack. Thus, if a country takes all necessary measures to fight terrorist groups or hackers, it would be exempt from responsibility for a cyberattack perpetrated from within its borders against another (victim) State in the eyes of the international community and the victim State.\nIn supporting this concept, I must note that the idea of international responsibility does not apply to cyberattacks attributed to States only but also to nonstate actors (e.g. hackers and terrorists) who use the State's territory to attack another State.\n### 3.2 Nonstate actors' responsibility for a cyberattack To establish such responsibility, I distinguish between cyberterrorism and cybercrime [28]. Cyberterrorism is committed by terrorists who use computer technology to apply their activities and are internationally motivated by political issues. Cybercrime is committed by hackers using internet technology to apply personal activities, such as manipulating a bank security system to steal money.\nDetermining the physical location to determine the responsibility of an attacker is normally a critical step to reliably establish his/her identity. Only by tracing the base computer where the virus was launched, its would be easy to identify the attacker and he/she can be verified; thus, tracking is possible. Often, however, this endeavor is not possible without the support of law enforcement agencies in the same State where the attacker launched the attack, which is less likely to occur in the case of a nation State-operated attack by its agents or supported hackers. For instance, breaking the chain of the network worm released at the Olympic Winter Games opening ceremony in Pyeongchang, South Korea, in 2018, was difficult. This malware was linked to other targeted attack groups known to have attacked other locations. These links led to confusion across the InfoSec industry in their attempts to assign attribution to the attacks because the attackers continually changed addresses and info flags [29].\nThe role of the State in adopting laws and imposing sanctions on these acts is notable. Many States, such as Kuwait, Jordan [30], the UAE [31], Germany [32], the UK [33] and the USA [34], have adopted cyber and electronic criminal law to prosecute such crimes and increase the punishments, to prevent hackers of nonstate actors from committing cybercrimes or attacks. For instance, Kuwaiti law prohibits unlawful access to a computer, its system, an electronic data processing system, an automated electronic system or an information network if this entry entails the abolition, deletion, destruction, disclosure, JFC 31,5 In addition, even if the attacker is a nonstate actor, the victim State may invoke the principle of self-defense under the principles of law [36]. In other words, if a cyberattack causes damage that approaches the equivalence of damage caused by an armed attack, the principle of self-defense applies to the victim State. However, the victim State may not act in self-defense if the cyber attacker acted without the support of the country in which he/she resided (or from which he/she perpetrated the attack). Thus, proof must be provided that the host State collaborated with the cybercriminal to attack the victim country to permit it (the victim country) to raise the international responsibility to invoke the right of self-defense defined in the UN Charter [37].\nMany substantial modifications have been applied to assure a State's responsibility for the actions of nonstate actors. Notably, an opinion of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia in the Tadic case [38] states that the State will be held responsible for supporting, planning or assisting groups' actions against another State. Thus, as long as the proof of the connection between the two is clear, international responsibility is established. Moreover, this creates a criterion in international responsibility when shifting between effective control (the State's responsibility) to overall control (State and nonstate actors' responsibility), which allows in both cases for the victim State to use force to defend itself [39].\nHowever, States should not exceed the limit of self-defense even for nonstate actors. The September 11 attacks against the USA were a clear example of a State invoking the right to self-defense, even when extending the principles of necessity for such defense and the proportionality of the attack. The USA altered its counterterrorism laws to comply with international law when it encouraged the Security Council to adopt Resolution 1373 (2001) [40] on fighting terrorism because it threatens international peace and security. This resolution created normative content on the use of force against nonstate actors (terrorists) located in a sovereign State (in this case, Afghanistan). Moreover, the USA practiced its right of self-defense under international law against a terrorist group called Al-Qaeda in Afghanistan. Although the USA used force against the State of Afghanistan, its intent was to strike nonstate actors located inside the country in response to their attacks against the national security of the USA.\nThe USA, in its right of self-defense, did not follow the rules of a traditional attack, namely, one State against another; by contrast, the USA relied on the CIL and the Law of War to fight the attack by creating new criteria for using force when the attack is perpetrated by nonstate actors, which had not been regulated by traditional international law. Thus, law can be developed over years on the basis of facing new challenges and danger, and the exact example is applicable to today's challenges of cyberattacks, where it can be compared with nonstate actors' cases.\nIn summary, the raising of a State's responsibility for its nonstate actors resulted from its failure to comply with international law and its violation of international rules by allowing nonstate actors to act from its territory to attack another State; [41] compared with a cyberattack, the responsibility raises because the State failed to prevent continued attacks against States and to investigate and prosecute the attackers for their actions within its territory and, finally, when the State failed to implement international law.\n## 4. International attempts to regulate cyberattacks The ICJ recognized in its decision in Nicaragua v. USA that the UN Charter provisions that restrict the use of force in international relations have become the CIL of jus ad bellum [42].\nThus, whether to categorize cyberattacks as a type of jus ad bellum and to create international instruments to govern cyberattacks become pertinent questions.\n## 4.1 Cybercrime Convention by the National Council of Europe The Cybercrime Convention was adopted by the European Council in Budapest in 2001. This convention aimed to create\"criminal policy aimed at the protection of society against cybercrime [...] by adopting appropriate legislation and fostering international cooperation\"[43]. This convention was the first on cybercrimes and cyberattacks through network by collaborating the national laws together, encouraging investigations and increasing international cooperation.\nThe principle aims of the convention are as follows: - harmonize the domestic criminal substantive law elements of offenses and connected provisions in the area of cybercrime; - provide for the domestic criminal procedural law powers necessary for the investigation and prosecution of such offenses as well as other offenses committed by means of a computer system or evidence in relation to which is in electronic form; and - set up a fast, effective regime of international cooperation [44].\nThe convention is the product of four years of work by European and international experts and has been supplemented by an additional protocol that makes any publication of racist, xenophobic propaganda through computer networks a criminal offense, similar to Criminal Libel laws. Currently, cyberterrorism is also studied in the framework of the convention. [45].\n## 4.2 Global program on cybercrime by the United Nations The complexity of the nature of cybercrimes and cyberattacks is from the increasing development of computer information and infrastructure, where perpetrators of those crimes are located worldwide and their crimes are crossing borders without an active international response.\nThe UN has attempted to thwart cyberattacks by adopting the UNGA Resolution 55/63. This resolution calls on Member States to prevent the criminal misuse of information technologies and acknowledge the value of inter alia. The following measures combat such misuse: - States should ensure that their laws and practices eliminate safe havens for individuals who criminally misuse information technologies.\n- Law enforcement cooperation in the investigation and prosecution of international cases of criminal misuse of information technologies should be coordinated among all concerned States.\n- Information should be exchanged between States regarding their problems in combating the criminal misuse of information technologies [46].\nSubsequently, the UNGA adopted Resolution 64/180 [47]. This resolution calls upon the UN Congress on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice to formulate solid suggestions for additional actions, drawing attention to practical arrangements to prevent organized crime and attacks, terrorism, corruption and technical assistance activities relating thereto and requests that the CCPCJ to work with the Economic and Social Council to achieve goals.\nInternational law enforcement Broadly, cybercrime can be described as having cyber-dependent offenses, cyber-enabled offenses and, as a specific crime type, online international attacks. This program is designed to support Member States to prevent and combat cybercrime or international attacks against States in a holistic manner. The main geographic nexus for the Cybercrime Program in 2017 are Central America, Eastern Africa, MENA and East Asia and the Pacific, and the key aims are as follows: Increase efficiency and effectiveness in the investigation, prosecution and adjudication of cybercrime, especially online transnational cyberattacks or human rights abuse.Efficient and effective long-term whole-of-government responses to cybercrime, including national coordination, data collection and effective legal frameworks, leading to a sustainable response and greater deterrence.Strengthen national and international communication between governments, law enforcement and the private sector and increase public knowledge of cybercrime risks [50].\n### Tallinn Manual by NATO Experts at the NATO Cyber Center of Excellence have guided the center to adopt the Tallinn Manual [51], a manual that explains how to apply international law in cases of cyberattacks. This manual collects various CILs and fundamental laws, rules, doctrines and international principles that can govern the cyber conflicts of the international community. The Tallinn Manual highlights eight factors to consider in defining cyber operations: immediacy, presumptive legality, military factors, severity, invasiveness, directness, country involvement and measurability of effects [52]. The IGE, which authored the Tallinn Manual, considered the ICJ's opinions and decisions on the use of force and based the manual on historical materials that have shaped this concept. The Tallinn Manual also covers “hacktivist” groups and a State's responsibility for an attack if such groups use it as a safe haven or if hacktivists are being protected by the State's intelligence agencies or officials [53].\nThe Tallinn Manual aims to set clear standards on situations involving cyber conflicts. For instance, the Tallinn Manual discusses the destruction and physical harm that can result from a cyberattack. According to Rule 13 of the Tallinn Manual [54], destruction or causalities caused by a cyberattack may elevate the attack to a level considered a “use of force”, which is prohibited by international law and the UN Charter [55]. Even if the attacker is a nonstate actor, the victim State may invoke the principle of self-defense under the principles of law, as stated previously [56].\nThus, I suggest that the Tallinn Manual fills the gaps in the international law on cyber conflicts. In general practice, parties refer first to international law and then rely on the Tallinn Manual to interpret the application of law in each case; [57] however, the Tallinn Manual has no jurisdiction over States outside the EU; thus, it creates an international instrument only applicable to cases of cyber. The Tallinn Manual summarizes a State's responsibility if a cyberattack causes a breach in international legal obligations; raises this point, based on the principles of the CIL; [58] and recognizes the responsibility of the agent/s responsible for cyber intrusion into another State. These aspects could lead to prosecution, for example, in the normal exercise of international laws and rules, either by the ICC or by domestic courts.\nNotably, the Tallinn Manual suggests that the term “armed” does not require the existence of weapons; however, it does stipulate that the factors of scale and affect are required to justify the victim State applying the use of force in its self-defense efforts [59]. Eliminating the physical element (i.e. weapons) of the definition of armed means that broadening the interpretation of the term “use of force” would make the application of international laws easier in cases of cyberattacks.\n## 5. Conclusion The frequency of cyberattacks and major information leaks have been increasing annually and attackers use complex ideas, tools and techniques and, in some cases, have received State support. Some attacks affect critical infrastructure and cause major destruction; thus, they pose risks to human lives and create unprecedented data leaks of confidential and classified information that cause mass disorder. The ability to attribute such attacks to States, groups or individuals can have a critical deterrent effect. Reliable identification of the attacker's origin prevents additional attacks from occurring, even if it raises a State's responsibility. This reason is an explanation of why nation-states are highly interested in the attribution of cyberattacks.\nTraditional international law and its provisions for attacks against territorial principles do not cover cyberattacks. Because the internet and cyberspace have neither boundaries nor limits, determining the laws to apply to cyber attackers is difficult. The matter of cyber conflicts raises the issues of aggressor nations, nonstate actors, international responsibility and the principle of self-defense.\nToday, implementing only traditional international law in cases of cyberwarfare is insufficient and the international community must adopt law that regulates and governs cyberspace and cyber conflicts. In addition, clear criteria should apply internationally to develop the CIL to manage the cyber challenges of the 21st century. Recognizing this necessity, some States have adopted measures and binding laws that regulate and categorize cyber conflicts. In many cases, these provisions grant the victim State the right to protect itself against any attack; however, those regulations remain nonbinding, unless an international governance treaty is created in the international community.\nIn conclusion, I have proposed several recommendations that acknowledge the importance of framing the legal instruments of cyberattacks, for example: - Countries should strengthen their cyber laws and cooperate with the international community to fight and establish a legal framework to combat cyberattacks.\n- The continual advancements in the methods used to wage the endemic threat of cyberattacks lead governments to continue to attempt to prevent all types of misuse of computer information and set protections on the internet.\n- Valarie Mac Niven recommends the following: expand the power of domestic law internationally, develop a system to use limited countermeasures where appropriate and apply effective enforcement of cyber laws [60].\n- No consensus exists on the definition of a cyberattack; thus, the international community or the UN must adopt a binding treaty similar to the Tallinn Manual to legally regulate this crime and punish perpetrators of transnational cybercrimes against States.\nJFC 31,5 1062"

For many countries, cyberattacks and conflicts, and even the basic operation of cyberspace, are new concerns.

Moreover, for States to use force in cyberwarfare, whether the right to use force exists under Article 51 of the United Nations (UN) Charter must be determined. To address these two concerns, whether cyberwarfare is under international law or domestic law must also be determined.\nThus, allowing a State to use force against cyberattacks should be justified under international law by assessing the aggressor State's responsibility. However, acknowledging any State's responsibility for a cyber intrusion has proven to be difficult, especially if the State depends on nonstate actors to launch a cyberattack against the victim State.\nIn this article, I analyze the aforementioned aspects of cyberattacks. In Part I, I conduct a comparison between a cyberattack as a domestic crime addressed under domestic laws and\nJournal of Financial Crime Vol. 31 No. 5, 2024 pp. 1052-1066 © Emerald Publishing Limited 1359-0790 DOI 10.1108/JFC-07-2023-0164\nas an international crime addressed under international laws. In Part II, I apply international law to cyberattacks. Finally, in Part III, I discuss committing cyberattacks by states and nonstate actors.\nA principal challenge to managing cyberattacks is the difficulty of proving that the event occurred and if so, who perpetrated it. Today's internet is in a constant, intense state of major development and it is almost impossible to establish internet boundaries between countries or to prove any party or State committed a cyberattack. Thus, the challenge is to evaluate whether the perpetrator of the cyberattack is domestic, international or a combination of the two, to apply the applicable law and determine whether the attacks can be considered under the Law of War.\nThus, I first define the meaning of cyberattack and then observe the purpose and the results of this type of attack, committed by a State or nonstate actors and whether it is under the State's sovereignty or has crossed its borders.\n### Definition of cyberattacks\nThe main aim of a cyberattack is to destroy computer systems of companies, institutions, ministries and other important landmarks of a State and the main focus is on confidential information stored in computers. Stamatis Karnouskos described a cyberattack as follows: acts that usually originate from an unidentified source, individuals or organizations, to attack an operational system to withdraw information for purpose of stealing, destroying or altering a specified target by hacking into the susceptible system .\nNo clear definition of computer crimes has been provided because of its multiple categories, for example, the employment of computer network operations with the intent to deny adversaries the effective use of their computers, information systems and networks while ensuring the effective use of our own computers, information systems and networks. These operations include computer network attack, computer network exploration and computer network defense . Thus, many institutions have attempted to define such crimes.\nStates have different definitions of cyberattack, for example, the USA, Russia and China. The US National Research Council defines individuals or organizations as “deliberate actions to alter, disrupt, deceive, degrade, or destroy computer systems or networks or the information and/or programs resident in or transiting these systems or networks” . Notably, to avoid misunderstandings, ambiguity or gaps, this definition makes no distinction between cyberattacks and cybercrimes. By contrast, China and Russia's definition of a cyberattack focus on the free use of technology. The Shanghai Cooperation Organization  -- a political, economic and security alliance created by China, Russia, Iran, Indian, Pakistan and some of the former States of the Soviet Union -- defines a cyberattack as “mass psychological brainwashing to destabilize society and state, as well as to force the state to take decisions in the interest of an opposing party” .\nThe increasing number of cyberattacks and their effects on States have become top national security concerns and the UN has proposed a plan to help. The UN plan attempts to address the most urgent shortcomings in information security and define sustainable medium-term and long-term strategies for information security for the international community .\nThe European Union's (EU) definition of a cyberattack recognizes these events as a source of disruption, conflict and geopolitical rivalries and says that “deliberate activities to disrupt or destroy computer systems and networks. Cyber-deterrence refers to measures for\ndissuading potential perpetrators through robust systems, sanctions mechanisms and cyber-diplomacy” .\nThe literature has attempted to define a cyberattack. Junaidu Marshall and Muazu Saulawa defined a cyberattack as:“Deliberate exploitation of computer systems, technology-dependent enterprises and networks. Cyberattacks use malicious code to alter computer code, logic or data, resulting in disruptive consequences that can compromise data and lead to cybercrimes, such as information and identity theft .”Others  attempted to distinguish the purpose of a cyberattack by analyzing the motive, opportunity and methods used in the attack. All those factors affect the result of cyberattacks and hence indicate the applicable law, namely, domestic or international.\n\n---\n\n## ## 5. Conclusion\n\nThe frequency of cyberattacks and major information leaks have been increasing annually and attackers use complex ideas, tools and techniques and, in some cases, have received State support. Some attacks affect critical infrastructure and cause major destruction; thus, they pose risks to human lives and create unprecedented data leaks of confidential and classified information that cause mass disorder. The ability to attribute such attacks to States, groups or individuals can have a critical deterrent effect. Reliable identification of the attacker's origin prevents additional attacks from occurring, even if it raises a State's responsibility. This reason is an explanation of why nation-states are highly interested in the attribution of cyberattacks.\nTraditional international law and its provisions for attacks against territorial principles do not cover cyberattacks. Because the internet and cyberspace have neither boundaries nor limits, determining the laws to apply to cyber attackers is difficult. The matter of cyber conflicts raises the issues of aggressor nations, nonstate actors, international responsibility and the principle of self-defense.\nToday, implementing only traditional international law in cases of cyberwarfare is insufficient and the international community must adopt law that regulates and governs cyberspace and cyber conflicts. In addition, clear criteria should apply internationally to develop the CIL to manage the cyber challenges of the 21st century. Recognizing this necessity, some States have adopted measures and binding laws that regulate and categorize cyber conflicts. In many cases, these provisions grant the victim State the right to protect itself against any attack; however, those regulations remain nonbinding, unless an international governance treaty is created in the international community.\nIn conclusion, I have proposed several recommendations that acknowledge the importance of framing the legal instruments of cyberattacks, for example:\n- Countries should strengthen their cyber laws and cooperate with the international community to fight and establish a legal framework to combat cyberattacks.\n- The continual advancements in the methods used to wage the endemic threat of cyberattacks lead governments to continue to attempt to prevent all types of misuse of computer information and set protections on the internet.\n- Valarie Mac Niven recommends the following: expand the power of domestic law internationally, develop a system to use limited countermeasures where appropriate and apply effective enforcement of cyber laws .\n- No consensus exists on the definition of a cyberattack; thus, the international community or the UN must adopt a binding treaty similar to the Tallinn Manual to legally regulate this crime and punish perpetrators of transnational cybercrimes against States.\nJFC 31,5\n1062",

    "as an international crime addressed under international laws. In Part II, I apply international law to cyberattacks. Finally, in Part III, I discuss committing cyberattacks by states and nonstate actors.\n\n## Cyberattacks as a domestic or international crime\n\nA principal challenge to managing cyberattacks is the difficulty of proving that the event occurred and if so, who perpetrated it. Today's internet is in a constant, intense state of major development and it is almost impossible to establish internet boundaries between countries or to prove any party or State committed a cyberattack. Thus, the challenge is to evaluate whether the perpetrator of the cyberattack is domestic, international or a combination of the two, to apply the applicable law and determine whether the attacks can be considered under the Law of War.\n\nThus, I first define the meaning of cyberattack and then observe the purpose and the results of this type of attack, committed by a State or nonstate actors and whether it is under the State's sovereignty or has crossed its borders.\n\n### Definition of cyberattacks\n\nThe main aim of a cyberattack is to destroy computer systems of companies, institutions, ministries and other important landmarks of a State and the main focus is on confidential information stored in computers. Stamatis Karnouskos described a cyberattack as follows: acts that usually originate from an unidentified source, individuals or organizations, to attack an operational system to withdraw information for purpose of stealing, destroying or altering a specified target by hacking into the susceptible system [2].\n\nNo clear definition of computer crimes has been provided because of its multiple categories, for example, the employment of computer network operations with the intent to deny adversaries the effective use of their computers, information systems and networks while ensuring the effective use of our own computers, information systems and networks. These operations include computer network attack, computer network exploration and computer network defense [3]. Thus, many institutions have attempted to define such crimes.\n\nStates have different definitions of cyberattack, for example, the USA, Russia and China. The US National Research Council defines individuals or organizations as “deliberate actions to alter, disrupt, deceive, degrade, or destroy computer systems or networks or the information and/or programs resident in or transiting these systems or networks” [4]. Notably, to avoid misunderstandings, ambiguity or gaps, this definition makes no distinction between cyberattacks and cybercrimes. By contrast, China and Russia's definition of a cyberattack focus on the free use of technology. The Shanghai Cooperation Organization [5] -- a political, economic and security alliance created by China, Russia, Iran, Indian, Pakistan and some of the former States of the Soviet Union -- defines a cyberattack as “mass psychological brainwashing to destabilize society and state, as well as to force the state to take decisions in the interest of an opposing party” [6].\n\nThe increasing number of cyberattacks and their effects on States have become top national security concerns and the UN has proposed a plan to help. The UN plan attempts to address the most urgent shortcomings in information security and define sustainable medium-term and long-term strategies for information security for the international community [7].\n\nThe European Union's (EU) definition of a cyberattack recognizes these events as a source of disruption, conflict and geopolitical rivalries and says that “deliberate activities to disrupt or destroy computer systems and networks. Cyber-deterrence refers to measures for",
    "dissuading potential perpetrators through robust systems, sanctions mechanisms and cyber-diplomacy” [8].\n\nThe literature has attempted to define a cyberattack. Junaidu Marshall and Muazu Saulawa defined a cyberattack as:“Deliberate exploitation of computer systems, technology-dependent enterprises and networks. Cyberattacks use malicious code to alter computer code, logic or data, resulting in disruptive consequences that can compromise data and lead to cybercrimes, such as information and identity theft [9].”Others [10] attempted to distinguish the purpose of a cyberattack by analyzing the motive, opportunity and methods used in the attack. All those factors affect the result of cyberattacks and hence indicate the applicable law, namely, domestic or international.\n\n### 2.2 Law applicable to cyberattacks\n\nThe legal definition of cyberwarfare and whether it is applicable under the current Law of War in international law or has another status that should be applied under domestic laws has not been determined. Thus, whether special international criminal law should be applied to cyberattacks and whether framing this type of attack through international treaties is appropriate ought to be determined. Currently, no comprehensive international treaty or convention exists to regulate cyberattacks [11]. Consequently, States have been using traditional methods to practice law, either by considering the event an international attack and responding to it under the Law of War or by acknowledging it as a criminal activity and prosecuting it under domestic criminal law.\n\nScholars such as Heather Dinniss, Francesca Spidalieri and Susan Brenner [12] have classified a cyberattack as a criminal act under domestic law for the following reasons: the difficulty of identifying the perpetrator and whether a State was the perpetrator; the uncertainty of whether a cyberattack can be legally considered an armed attack to which international law and the Law of War are applicable and whether the resulting damage or harm is similar to that caused by a traditional attack; and the right to use force for self-defense requires a physical attack by one State against another under the Law of War. Therefore, based on their reasons, applying domestic criminal law in cyberattack situations might be favorable.\n\nBy contrast, scholars such as Jeffery Carr, Louise Arimatsu and Joanna Kulesza [13] have classified cyberattacks under international law and Customary International Law (CIL). I support this perspective for several reasons. First, because attacking a State's infrastructure may cause as much harm and damage as an armed attack, applying domestic law would prevent the State from exercising its right of self-defense under international law, which is binding on other States. Second, applying domestic criminal law in such a case is ineffective because some States may refuse to extradite or prosecute the attackers under another State's law, which they (i.e. States and attackers) are not bound by. Third, organizing a cyberattack under international law would provide States legal cover when solving issues in international relations; by relying on the sovereign equality principle [14] between States, States can solve such issues in an equal, effective manner under the supervision of the international community, the UN and the Security Council.\n\nCyberattacks raise more challenges in enforcing the law because they are an unusual type of attack with an impact that may cross the border of a single State and may damage another State. Such cross-border damage may threaten international peace and security, violate the UN Charter and therefore transform into an international issue that should be",
    "International law enforcement\n1055\n\nresolved by international law rather than domestic law, which may not be binding on attackers from another State or raise the State's responsibility internationally.\n\nMoreover, although the classification of a cyberattack as an international attack rather than domestic attack can be based on responsibility, proving that the attack source was from another State either raises its responsibility before international law or the State will be responsible for the acts of the nonstate actors who initiated the attack from its territory because if the attackers acted within the State's borders to cause an attack, domestic criminal law is applicable because those attackers are criminals.\n\nTherefore, categorizing cyberattacks as domestic crimes would cause problems in applying protections to States' sovereignty in international law or in passive defense, which means preemptive protection of States, because States would have difficulty reducing the number of attacks launched from computers against its infrastructure by depending on a passive defense. Notably, a more efficient perspective is to consider a cyberattack an international crime because criminal law has been insufficiently effective at preventing cyberattacks, for example, some States, such as Russia and China, have not prosecuted their attackers for cybercrimes committed against other States, whether the attackers were located within their borders or attackers used by them [15].\n\n## 3. Implementation of international law on cyberattacks\n\nCyberattacks are a new form of conflict. The main purpose of cyberattacks is to undermine the functions of computers and to destroy their infrastructure and networks to disrupt the communications of, for example, a company or a country. To use force under Article 39 or Article 51 of the UN Charter, there must be a \"threat to international peace and security, breach of peace or act of aggression\". Accordingly, the question becomes whether a cyberattack is a breach of peace or an act of aggression. Thus, by understanding the definition of cyber (not actual or physical) attacks, the critical question is whether international law can regulate cyberwarfare. This question is, especially, relevant because no conventions on cyberwarfare have been established.\n\nA comparison between the effects of an armed attack and a cyberattack can be considered from many perspectives. First, by analyzing the \"instrument approach\" [16], which means if the instrument used in a cyberattack can cause damage similar to the damage caused by instruments used in a kinetic attack, a cyberattack can be characterized as an armed attack, which is an act of aggression that allows the use of force. Such an act would be, for instance, using the internet to blockade a city by shutting down its power grid, because in a kinetic case, the power grid would be bombed by using more kinetic means to cause the same result.\n\nSecond, analyzing the \"consequences\" of the attack [17] can occur when the results of a cyberattack can be similarly achieved by a kinetic attack, that is, the harm and damage to a State's sovereignty or its infrastructure would be the same in both cases. Consequently, the attack has achieved the core of aggression prohibited by international law. For instance, attacking the system that operates oil wells and preventing their operation would cause the same consequences as bombing the same system, because the result of shutting down oil distribution would be the same. For example, in 2012, Iran fomented a cyberattack against one of the largest oil companies in the world, Aramco, which is owned by Saudi Arabia, by releasing the Shamoon virus. This virus caused massive damage to more than 30,000 computers within Aramco's infrastructure, which destroyed operations and business proceedings for nearly two weeks [18] and caused Saudi Arabia to suffer substantial financial losses.",
    "JFC 31,5\n1056\n\nThird, an analysis would be conducted on the “direct liability” that may cause severe damage against the State’s infrastructure system in the same manner that may result from an armed attack, which raises the responsibility of the aggressor State [19].\n\nTherefore, to rely on international law to justify the use of countermeasures against a cyberattack, the damage or harm that the attack caused should be equal to that caused by a physical armed attack against which the victim State would respond to protect itself (i.e. the principle of self-defense) [20].\n\nInternational relations should be built on good faith and each nation should respect the internal affairs of other nations [21]. Otherwise, the aggressor State would be in violation of international law principles and would be attacking another State even if the attack was a cyberattack. A clear example of breaching the nonintervention principle occurred in 2007 when Russia perpetrated a cyberattack against Estonia, described as the most famous wide-range cyberattack. The duration of Russia’s cyberattack was three weeks and caused significant damage to Estonia’s electronics and telecommunication infrastructure. Apparently, the attack was in retaliation for the Estonian Government’s decision to remove a Russian monument from the center of an Estonian city, despite the threats from Russia. However, Russia’s international responsibility for committing this act of aggression against Estonia was never raised, because it was never acknowledged [22].\n\nAccordingly, a cyberattack can constitute an armed attack that causes the prohibited crime of aggression, raising the responsibility of the aggressor State and allowing the victim State to use force under Article 39 by gaining Security Council authorization.\n\n## 3.1 State responsibility cyberattacks\n\nThe concept of a State’s responsibility has been a base for international security, especially because many conflicts have arisen because of sovereignty issues. The question I attempt to answer in this section is what may raise a State’s responsibility for its actions? Due to violations of international law principles and another State’s sovereignty, the victim State may use legal measures to defend itself against any attack, cyber or kinetic, and such a matter obtains its legitimacy directly from Jus Cogen principles.\n\nThe speed of the growth of cyberattacks is making it difficult to track perpetrators, namely, nations and terrorists. Therefore, to raise a State’s responsibility, the attack must be proven to have been committed by the aggressor State. One of the difficulties in this matter is to prove who committed the cyberattack. In the early days of the internet, there was a unique IP address, an electronic address used to connect a user to the internet, which would indisputably identify the user to which it was assigned. Today, however, IP addresses are increasingly difficult to identify because users can now change their IP addresses and/or the location (e.g. country) in which the IP address is active. Thus, an agent located in State A can commit an attack against State B under an IP address from a State C, despite the agent’s location being State A.\n\nFor these reasons, the aggressor State must contribute to a cross-border cyberattack by allowing its agent to use passive measures to attack another State’s computer system to cause massive damage, which allows the victim State to use its right to defend itself against such an intrusion when the cyberattack is raised to the level of an armed attack. Thus, for those reasons, David Graham said:\n\nStates acting on the perceived legal requirement that they must conclusively attribute a cyberattack to another State or its agents historically have chosen to respond to cross-border cyberattacks as they would to criminal matters, employing only “passive” (computer security) measures to and urging the States from which the attacks originated to investigate and prosecute those responsible [23].",
    "Jus ad bellum follows international law in its implementation and thus might also be applicable to cyber conflicts. Harold Koh stated that international law applies to cyberspace issues; however, each case should be considered individually because not all cases may justify the implementation of traditional law [24]. With the development of technology, international law should also be developed. New challenges and new cybertechnology should be considered, especially when relying on the CIL, where States start acting against new threats by creating new customary principles that reshape international law [25], to develop and govern the challenges and technology in this century, where the traditional Law of War is ineffective.\n\nThe international responsibility borne by a State for a wrongful act falls under jus in bello. The State is also responsible for the actions of agents under its direct control and in guiding them to attack other States [26], a rule adopted by the ICJ and the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia [27]. In other words, a State is responsible for implementing all measures to prevent individuals or groups from attacking other countries if they are acting solely without instruction from the State from which they are acting; otherwise, the State will have more responsibility for the attack. Thus, if a country takes all necessary measures to fight terrorist groups or hackers, it would be exempt from responsibility for a cyberattack perpetrated from within its borders against another (victim) State in the eyes of the international community and the victim State.\n\nIn supporting this concept, I must note that the idea of international responsibility does not apply to cyberattacks attributed to States only but also to nonstate actors (e.g. hackers and terrorists) who use the State's territory to attack another State.\n\n### 3.2 Nonstate actors' responsibility for a cyberattack\n\nTo establish such responsibility, I distinguish between cyberterrorism and cybercrime [28]. Cyberterrorism is committed by terrorists who use computer technology to apply their activities and are internationally motivated by political issues. Cybercrime is committed by hackers using internet technology to apply personal activities, such as manipulating a bank security system to steal money.\n\nDetermining the physical location to determine the responsibility of an attacker is normally a critical step to reliably establish his/her identity. Only by tracing the base computer where the virus was launched, its would be easy to identify the attacker and he/she can be verified; thus, tracking is possible. Often, however, this endeavor is not possible without the support of law enforcement agencies in the same State where the attacker launched the attack, which is less likely to occur in the case of a nation State-operated attack by its agents or supported hackers. For instance, breaking the chain of the network worm released at the Olympic Winter Games opening ceremony in Pyeongchang, South Korea, in 2018, was difficult. This malware was linked to other targeted attack groups known to have attacked other locations. These links led to confusion across the InfoSec industry in their attempts to assign attribution to the attacks because the attackers continually changed addresses and info flags [29].\n\nThe role of the State in adopting laws and imposing sanctions on these acts is notable. Many States, such as Kuwait, Jordan [30], the UAE [31], Germany [32], the UK [33] and the USA [34], have adopted cyber and electronic criminal law to prosecute such crimes and increase the punishments, to prevent hackers of nonstate actors from committing cybercrimes or attacks. For instance, Kuwaiti law prohibits unlawful access to a computer, its system, an electronic data processing system, an automated electronic system or an information network if this entry entails the abolition, deletion, destruction, disclosure,",
    "JFC 31,5\n1058\n\nalteration or republication of data or information [35]. This example demonstrates how States have attempted to add cybercrimes to their domestic laws.\n\nIn addition, even if the attacker is a nonstate actor, the victim State may invoke the principle of self-defense under the principles of law [36]. In other words, if a cyberattack causes damage that approaches the equivalence of damage caused by an armed attack, the principle of self-defense applies to the victim State. However, the victim State may not act in self-defense if the cyber attacker acted without the support of the country in which he/she resided (or from which he/she perpetrated the attack). Thus, proof must be provided that the host State collaborated with the cybercriminal to attack the victim country to permit it (the victim country) to raise the international responsibility to invoke the right of self-defense defined in the UN Charter [37].\n\nMany substantial modifications have been applied to assure a State's responsibility for the actions of nonstate actors. Notably, an opinion of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia in the Tadic case [38] states that the State will be held responsible for supporting, planning or assisting groups' actions against another State. Thus, as long as the proof of the connection between the two is clear, international responsibility is established. Moreover, this creates a criterion in international responsibility when shifting between effective control (the State's responsibility) to overall control (State and nonstate actors' responsibility), which allows in both cases for the victim State to use force to defend itself [39].\n\nHowever, States should not exceed the limit of self-defense even for nonstate actors. The September 11 attacks against the USA were a clear example of a State invoking the right to self-defense, even when extending the principles of necessity for such defense and the proportionality of the attack. The USA altered its counterterrorism laws to comply with international law when it encouraged the Security Council to adopt Resolution 1373 (2001) [40] on fighting terrorism because it threatens international peace and security. This resolution created normative content on the use of force against nonstate actors (terrorists) located in a sovereign State (in this case, Afghanistan). Moreover, the USA practiced its right of self-defense under international law against a terrorist group called Al-Qaeda in Afghanistan. Although the USA used force against the State of Afghanistan, its intent was to strike nonstate actors located inside the country in response to their attacks against the national security of the USA.\n\nThe USA, in its right of self-defense, did not follow the rules of a traditional attack, namely, one State against another; by contrast, the USA relied on the CIL and the Law of War to fight the attack by creating new criteria for using force when the attack is perpetrated by nonstate actors, which had not been regulated by traditional international law. Thus, law can be developed over years on the basis of facing new challenges and danger, and the exact example is applicable to today's challenges of cyberattacks, where it can be compared with nonstate actors' cases.\n\nIn summary, the raising of a State's responsibility for its nonstate actors resulted from its failure to comply with international law and its violation of international rules by allowing nonstate actors to act from its territory to attack another State; [41] compared with a cyberattack, the responsibility raises because the State failed to prevent continued attacks against States and to investigate and prosecute the attackers for their actions within its territory and, finally, when the State failed to implement international law.\n\n## 4. International attempts to regulate cyberattacks\n\nThe ICJ recognized in its decision in Nicaragua v. USA that the UN Charter provisions that restrict the use of force in international relations have become the CIL of jus ad bellum [42].",
    "Thus, whether to categorize cyberattacks as a type of jus ad bellum and to create international instruments to govern cyberattacks become pertinent questions.\n\n## 4.1 Cybercrime Convention by the National Council of Europe\n\nThe Cybercrime Convention was adopted by the European Council in Budapest in 2001. This convention aimed to create \"criminal policy aimed at the protection of society against cybercrime [...] by adopting appropriate legislation and fostering international cooperation\" [43]. This convention was the first on cybercrimes and cyberattacks through network by collaborating the national laws together, encouraging investigations and increasing international cooperation.\n\nThe principle aims of the convention are as follows:\n\n- harmonize the domestic criminal substantive law elements of offenses and connected provisions in the area of cybercrime;\n- provide for the domestic criminal procedural law powers necessary for the investigation and prosecution of such offenses as well as other offenses committed by means of a computer system or evidence in relation to which is in electronic form; and\n- set up a fast, effective regime of international cooperation [44].\n\nThe convention is the product of four years of work by European and international experts and has been supplemented by an additional protocol that makes any publication of racist, xenophobic propaganda through computer networks a criminal offense, similar to Criminal Libel laws. Currently, cyberterrorism is also studied in the framework of the convention. [45].\n\n## 4.2 Global program on cybercrime by the United Nations\n\nThe complexity of the nature of cybercrimes and cyberattacks is from the increasing development of computer information and infrastructure, where perpetrators of those crimes are located worldwide and their crimes are crossing borders without an active international response.\n\nThe UN has attempted to thwart cyberattacks by adopting the UNGA Resolution 55/63. This resolution calls on Member States to prevent the criminal misuse of information technologies and acknowledge the value of inter alia. The following measures combat such misuse:\n\n- States should ensure that their laws and practices eliminate safe havens for individuals who criminally misuse information technologies.\n- Law enforcement cooperation in the investigation and prosecution of international cases of criminal misuse of information technologies should be coordinated among all concerned States.\n- Information should be exchanged between States regarding their problems in combating the criminal misuse of information technologies [46].\n\nSubsequently, the UNGA adopted Resolution 64/180 [47]. This resolution calls upon the UN Congress on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice to formulate solid suggestions for additional actions, drawing attention to practical arrangements to prevent organized crime and attacks, terrorism, corruption and technical assistance activities relating thereto and requests that the CCPCJ to work with the Economic and Social Council to achieve goals.\n\nInternational law enforcement\n1059",
    "Moreover, the UNGA adopted Resolution 65/230 [48], supporting the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Resolutions 22/7 and 22/8 [49], to assist Member States in their struggles and obstacles in preventing cyberattacks and to encourage cooperation in implementing international legal instruments pertaining to transnational organized cyberattacks.\n\nBroadly, cybercrime can be described as having cyber-dependent offenses, cyber-enabled offenses and, as a specific crime type, online international attacks. This program is designed to support Member States to prevent and combat cybercrime or international attacks against States in a holistic manner. The main geographic nexus for the Cybercrime Program in 2017 are Central America, Eastern Africa, MENA and East Asia and the Pacific, and the key aims are as follows: Increase efficiency and effectiveness in the investigation, prosecution and adjudication of cybercrime, especially online transnational cyberattacks or human rights abuse.Efficient and effective long-term whole-of-government responses to cybercrime, including national coordination, data collection and effective legal frameworks, leading to a sustainable response and greater deterrence.Strengthen national and international communication between governments, law enforcement and the private sector and increase public knowledge of cybercrime risks [50].\n\n### Tallinn Manual by NATO\n\nExperts at the NATO Cyber Center of Excellence have guided the center to adopt the Tallinn Manual [51], a manual that explains how to apply international law in cases of cyberattacks. This manual collects various CILs and fundamental laws, rules, doctrines and international principles that can govern the cyber conflicts of the international community. The Tallinn Manual highlights eight factors to consider in defining cyber operations: immediacy, presumptive legality, military factors, severity, invasiveness, directness, country involvement and measurability of effects [52]. The IGE, which authored the Tallinn Manual, considered the ICJ's opinions and decisions on the use of force and based the manual on historical materials that have shaped this concept. The Tallinn Manual also covers “hacktivist” groups and a State's responsibility for an attack if such groups use it as a safe haven or if hacktivists are being protected by the State's intelligence agencies or officials [53].\n\nThe Tallinn Manual aims to set clear standards on situations involving cyber conflicts. For instance, the Tallinn Manual discusses the destruction and physical harm that can result from a cyberattack. According to Rule 13 of the Tallinn Manual [54], destruction or causalities caused by a cyberattack may elevate the attack to a level considered a “use of force”, which is prohibited by international law and the UN Charter [55]. Even if the attacker is a nonstate actor, the victim State may invoke the principle of self-defense under the principles of law, as stated previously [56].\n\nThus, I suggest that the Tallinn Manual fills the gaps in the international law on cyber conflicts. In general practice, parties refer first to international law and then rely on the Tallinn Manual to interpret the application of law in each case; [57] however, the Tallinn Manual has no jurisdiction over States outside the EU; thus, it creates an international instrument only applicable to cases of cyber. The Tallinn Manual summarizes a State's responsibility if a cyberattack causes a breach in international legal obligations; raises this",
    "point, based on the principles of the CIL; [58] and recognizes the responsibility of the agent/s responsible for cyber intrusion into another State. These aspects could lead to prosecution, for example, in the normal exercise of international laws and rules, either by the ICC or by domestic courts.\n\nNotably, the Tallinn Manual suggests that the term “armed” does not require the existence of weapons; however, it does stipulate that the factors of scale and affect are required to justify the victim State applying the use of force in its self-defense efforts [59]. Eliminating the physical element (i.e. weapons) of the definition of armed means that broadening the interpretation of the term “use of force” would make the application of international laws easier in cases of cyberattacks.\n\n## 5. Conclusion\n\nThe frequency of cyberattacks and major information leaks have been increasing annually and attackers use complex ideas, tools and techniques and, in some cases, have received State support. Some attacks affect critical infrastructure and cause major destruction; thus, they pose risks to human lives and create unprecedented data leaks of confidential and classified information that cause mass disorder. The ability to attribute such attacks to States, groups or individuals can have a critical deterrent effect. Reliable identification of the attacker's origin prevents additional attacks from occurring, even if it raises a State's responsibility. This reason is an explanation of why nation-states are highly interested in the attribution of cyberattacks.\n\nTraditional international law and its provisions for attacks against territorial principles do not cover cyberattacks. Because the internet and cyberspace have neither boundaries nor limits, determining the laws to apply to cyber attackers is difficult. The matter of cyber conflicts raises the issues of aggressor nations, nonstate actors, international responsibility and the principle of self-defense.\n\nToday, implementing only traditional international law in cases of cyberwarfare is insufficient and the international community must adopt law that regulates and governs cyberspace and cyber conflicts. In addition, clear criteria should apply internationally to develop the CIL to manage the cyber challenges of the 21st century. Recognizing this necessity, some States have adopted measures and binding laws that regulate and categorize cyber conflicts. In many cases, these provisions grant the victim State the right to protect itself against any attack; however, those regulations remain nonbinding, unless an international governance treaty is created in the international community.\n\nIn conclusion, I have proposed several recommendations that acknowledge the importance of framing the legal instruments of cyberattacks, for example:\n\n- Countries should strengthen their cyber laws and cooperate with the international community to fight and establish a legal framework to combat cyberattacks.\n- The continual advancements in the methods used to wage the endemic threat of cyberattacks lead governments to continue to attempt to prevent all types of misuse of computer information and set protections on the internet.\n- Valarie Mac Niven recommends the following: expand the power of domestic law internationally, develop a system to use limited countermeasures where appropriate and apply effective enforcement of cyber laws [60].\n- No consensus exists on the definition of a cyberattack; thus, the international community or the UN must adopt a binding treaty similar to the Tallinn Manual to legally regulate this crime and punish perpetrators of transnational cybercrimes against States.",

The organization is also redefining cyberwarfare by saying that the dissemination of information “harmful to the spiritual, moral and cultural spheres of other states” should be considered a “security threat”. An accord adopted in 2009 defined “information war” as an effort by a state to undermine another’s “political, economic and social systems”. A diplomat reported in 2017 that the SCO has foiled 600 terror plots and extradited 500 terrorists through RATS. See Gjelten (2010a, 2010b) and Desai (2017).\n6.

Government security expert Richard Clarke defines cyberwar as “actions by a nation-state to penetrate another nation’s computers or networks for the purposes of causing damage or disruption” (Clarke and Knake, 2010, p. 6). Former National Security Advisor and Central Intelligence Agency Director Michael Hayden defines cyberwar as the “deliberate attempt to disable or destroy another country’s computer networks” (Gjelten, 2010a, 2010b).\n11. There have been attempts by international organizations, such as the UN, to highlight the importance of cyberattacks and to set a map for legalizing cyber. One example is the UN Internet Governance Forum (UN IGF). Internet governance was one of the most controversial issues at the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) and at the subsequent WSIS+10 review by the General Assembly in the wake of the adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2015. Cognizant that any internet governance approach should be inclusive and responsive, the WSIS mandated the UN Secretary-General to convene the Global Internet Governance Forum (IGF) for multistakeholder policy dialogue. The convening of the IGF was announced by the UN Secretary-General on July 18, 2006. Available at: www.intgovforum.org.\n12.

    "abstract": "Purpose – This paper aims to manage the dilemma of cyberspace operations, as the incidence of cybercrimes has increased tremendously in the past few decades, turning cyberspace into a field of war in which all nations must fight. For many countries, cyberattacks and conflicts, and even the basic operation of cyberspace in general, are new territories. Furthermore, international law today does not address many aspects of cyber warfare, as it typically has dealt with only traditional warfare. Design/methodology/approach – This study examined this crime whether it is a domestic or an international crime and whether cyber wars are under international law or domestic law to address these issues. Findings – Although many attempts to criminalize these actions occurred, the findings suggest that the world has failed to frame the legal instruments against cyberattacks. The findings also suggest recommendations to solve this issue. Originality/value – To the best of the author's knowledge, this study analyzed the comparison between the same crime in the perspective of domestic and international law, highlighting an unsolved dilemma in the world, suggesting some unprecedented solutions to solve.
