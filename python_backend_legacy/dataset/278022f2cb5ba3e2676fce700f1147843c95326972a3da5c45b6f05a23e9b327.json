While cyberspace is often viewed as a virtual world, it is composed of vulnerable physical infrastructure. The vast amount of digital infrastructure that supports the Internet, the economy, the government, and the military makes it nearly impossible to guarantee total security. The more dependent a country becomes on the Internet and the more interconnected its systems become, the more vulnerable the country is to hackers or foreign intelligence services conducting espionage. The National Intelligence Council stated in its most recent quadrennial report, Global Trends 2025: A Transformed World, that the increasing use of cyber warfare is one of the primary factors that \"will constrict U.S. freedom of action.\" It is particularly difficult for the U.S. government to respond to cyber attacks because it is very difficult to track the source of an attack and to determine who initiated it. The international race to build cyber defenses and to develop offensive capabilities, as well as the lack of law governing cyberspace, makes cyber warfare one of the most urgent national security problems facing the United States.\n\n# CYBERSPACE IS A REAL AND GROWING THREAT\n\nCyberspace is wrongly viewed as something that cannot be seen, only existing in a virtual form. Cyberspace is real and has very physical components. It exists in the computer systems that enable Wall Street to function and it forms the backbone of all major companies. Cyberspace also exists in the critical infrastructure that allows computers to communicate with each other, such as the main communication trunk line from Europe to the United States that comes up on the New Jersey shore. It plays a major role in the functioning of software, computers, and\n\nLBJ JOURNAL OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS",

Cyberspace includes the broadband networks, wireless signals, and local area networks in schools. It also encompasses the critical military and intelligence networks designed to protect the United States. While the Internet has made society more interconnected than at any time in history, it has also made it easier for domestic and foreign hackers to disrupt daily life.\n\nCyber attack refers to a deliberate action to \"alter, disrupt, deceive, degrade, or destroy\" networks, computer systems, or programs that may be contained on a computer or moving through a system.² A cyber attack generally involves penetrating a computer network as a means to disrupt an opponent's critical services, such as accessing a utility control system. Groups that operate independently or with state sponsorship that can gain access to intellectual property or classified military information are a growing threat. However, there are legitimate uses of cyber attacks. The United States prepares to conduct cyber attacks in conjunction with other information warfare methods and with conventional attacks to protect national security. Domestic law enforcement also engages in cyber attacks when jamming devices are used to prevent cell phone calls when suspected to be used to detonate a bomb.\n\nCyber attacks became much more common during the late 1990s, including such cases as the 1998 Internet Worm, Melissa Virus, I-LOVE-YOU virus, Code Red Virus, and the Nimda Virus. Initially, attacks consisted of malware, such as viruses and worms. Today, cyber attacks are increasingly sophisticated and adaptive. Security breaches and information theft are commonplace in the news. Foreign intelligence services from countries such as China, Israel, Iran, Russia, and the United States have used cyber capabilities defensively and offensively.\n\nThe first major test of the U.S. government's cyber infrastructure from cyber attacks was Eligible Receiver in June 1997, a Joint Staff test exercise run by the Department of Defense (DOD).³ The unannounced exercise targeted 20 different agencies and revealed significant vulnerabilities within the U.S. government's information infrastructures. A team of 35 computer experts from the National Security Agency split into four teams to simulate hackers trying to penetrate U.S. computer networks. The teams used publicly available information and tools found on the Internet and commercial Internet accounts to exploit actual vulnerabilities. Over the next two weeks they successfully hacked into power grids of nine U.S. cities and cracked their 911 emergency systems. They also attacked the Pentagon's computer networks, gaining access to 36 of them. Only two of the attacks were detected. Once inside the systems, the teams had complete access and were able to issue fake orders and news reports about the crisis. As a result, no one in the entire chain of command could be certain of what was accurate. If it had been a real attack, the four teams would have been able to prevent the United States from responding effectively.⁴\n\nThe severity of security challenges posed by cyber warfare to any country is highly related to the degree of its dependence on modern information and communications technology. Countries with advanced internet accessibility, including widespread online commerce and banking, possess far more vulnerabilities to at-\n\nLBJ JOURNAL OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS",

For example, an undercover Defense Department employee said that it would be possible to hit three undisclosed communication \"nodes\" in the United States and severely impair communications across the country.⁵ The Department of Energy conducted an experiment, the Aurora Generator Test, to determine if a 27-ton power generator could be disabled using the Internet.⁶ The group of scientists was able to hack into the control system and use the controls to cause the generator to shudder, overheat, and eventually to fatally malfunction. In a real world scenario, losing several large power generators would cause a prolonged disruption. The generators are expensive, made overseas, and require up to four months to obtain. A well-targeted cyber attack could shut down a power plant for months.⁷ The power grid is one of the most vulnerable infrastructure systems to cyber attack in part because it is operated by private utilities that are not required to comply with government security decrees.⁸ With the move toward a Smart Grid, which relies on interconnected networks of computer-controlled nodes, its vulnerability could increase because each node would operate automatically over the Internet to regulate the flow of power. If the nodes are not secure, they can be hacked and used to disrupt the delivery of electricity.⁹ Additionally, there are only about five software systems used to run power grids, dams, utilities, and pipelines that rely on wireless supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems in which one node provides instructions to another node in the chain. If compromised, the SCADA system could send fake instructions, potentially causing severe damage to critical infrastructure. One of the benefits of the outdated air traffic control system in the U.S. is that because it is so old, it is not directly connected to the Internet, and is less susceptible to a cyber attack.¹⁰\n\nEvery day there are thousands of cyber attacks on federal and private computer systems. The DOD estimated that in 2007 there were 43,880 incidents of malicious activity from all sources on five million computers, a 31 percent increase from 2006.¹¹ Some attacks are malicious, but others appear to be testing the chinks in the patchwork of firewalls. The most dangerous aspect is the attacks that go undetected by common security tools. The number of attacks is increasing and they are becoming increasingly bold. In January 2008, a Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) official stated that the CIA knew hackers had disrupted or threatened to disrupt power in four foreign cities.¹² The enormous challenge of defending cyber infrastructure ranges from forensic tasks to determine attack attribution to the broader concern of proportionality of a response and what is considered a legitimate target.\n\nA CSIS panel researched potential vulnerabilities and determined that the main threat is not the capabilities of individual hackers but the capabilities of other nations, such as China and Russia. Team Cymru, a research company, reviewed Internet scans that attempted to enter industrial control systems. Scans originated from 14 different countries, including China, Iran, Israel, Russia, Taiwan, and even the United States. The Team Cymru results showed that 90 percent of the scans originated in China.¹³\n\nLBJ JOURNAL OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS",

Former Director of National Intelligence (DNI) Mike McConnell told President Bush in 2007 that if a large U.S. bank were successfully hacked, \"it would have an order-of-magnitude greater impact on the global economy\" than the September 11, 2001, attacks. McConnell warned, \"the ability to threaten the U.S. money supply is the equivalent of today's nuclear weapon.\"14 A cyber attack on the banking system could shut down the system that clears all financial transactions, thus undermining all confidence in the monetary system.\n\nIn a cyber war, it is difficult to determine the source of an attack or the attacker's identity. The ability to backtrack a cyber attack to the source depends on a rapid response capability on the order of seconds, minutes, or hours. The pathways used by hackers may only be active for milliseconds and often there is no identifying evidence that remains once the hacker has completed his objective. In the case of the Team Cymru study, the team could not identify whether military organizations, intelligence agencies, terrorists, criminals, or inventive individuals were the source of the cyber attacks.[15] Even if the physical origin of an attack can be identified, there is no guarantee that the hacker behind the attack is sponsored by that country or that the hacker is even located within the given country.[16]\n\nA new type of cyber warfare that is growing is hybrid warfare.[17] National governments rather than individual hackers carry out this type of attack. Hybrid warfare is a cyber attack that is timed to coincide with a conventional military offensive. A cyber attack using mass communication sources in conjunction with a conventional military attack may also be used to influence global public opinion.[18] Hybrid warfare is particularly threatening because it is designed to prevent an effective response by the targeted country to a physical attack.\n\nAn offensive tool in the cyber arsenal is the botnet, a collection of computers that have been compromised by malicious software. The program commandeers the infected machines, creating a vast network. The compromised computers, known as \"zombies,\" can be remotely controlled, often without the knowledge of anyone using the zombie computer. The zombie network can be instructed to attack a designated target by overwhelming it with thousands of commands.[19] In an actual cyber war, a successful cyber attack would target computer-dependent infrastructure, such as a nation's power grid or banking system. Also, an attack on a nation's air traffic control system could blind the air traffic controllers' air defense networks, hindering an effective counterstrike.[20]\n\n# USE OF CYBER WARFARE BY FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE SERVICES\n\n## CYBER ATTACK ON ESTONIA\n\nIn 2007, Estonia was subject to a prolonged cyber attack suspected of being sponsored by Russia. Estonia, a developed former Soviet Republic, has a high level of access to advanced communications technology.

Beginning in March 2007, Estonians can even vote online.21 Over 60 percent of the population has online access to bank accounts and 95 percent of banking transactions are online.22 Russian hackers were patiently waiting for a pretext to test Estonia's cyber defenses.\n\nIn April 2007, the Estonian government decided to relocate a monument that commemorated the Soviet armed forces' contribution to liberating Estonia from Nazi control during World War II. Moving the monument from the center of Tallinn, the capital, to a military cemetery outside the city sparked protests and riots among the Russian minority. The event may have provided the pretext, and the unrest was closely followed by distributed denial of service (DDOS) attacks originating in Russia.23 A call to action and step-by-step instructions about how to carry out DDOS attacks spread through Russian chat rooms. The Estonian government websites that normally received 1,000 visitors per day suddenly started receiving 2,000 visits per second.24 Anyone who attempted to access the target sites had their computer screens frozen.25 The websites of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Justice shut down, and the Prime Minister Andrus Ansip's Reform Party website was defaced by the addition of an image of Prime Minister Ansip with an Adolf Hitler mustache. The Russian hackers also briefly disabled the national emergency phone number.26\n\nThe United States and NATO sent computer security teams to aid the Estonian authorities to cope with the DDOS waves that overpowered the country's government websites, banking industry, and media organizations. The clandestine groups of hackers were not confirmed to be operating with Russian sponsorship, but evidence suggests the Russian authorities were at least complicit.27 The unusual aspect of the attacks was that they lasted for several weeks and had a very high intensity. Some of the botnets used in the DDOS attacks included up to 100,000 zombie computers. The commandeered computers directed large amounts of data at Estonia's government websites and banking system.28 The US-NATO efforts stabilized the situation, but intermittent attacks continued until mid-May 2007.29\n\nIn response to the cyber attacks, NATO established the Cooperative Defense Center in Estonia in May 2008. The center is staffed by 30 cyber specialists and is part of NATO's network of Centers of Excellence accredited to train representatives from member states about technical aspects of NATO operations.30 However, the new center's vulnerability was shown with the capture of Herman Simm in September 2008, which also further implicated Russia in the cyber attack on Estonia.31\n\nHerman Simm, 61, was a high ranking official working in the Estonian Ministry of Defense. In 2001, he was appointed head of the State Secret Protection Office. He also developed the information protection systems for NATO and the European Union, frequently leading Estonian talks on protecting classified data. He was described as being “at the cutting edge of NATO's most important new strategic missions: to defend the alliance against cyber-attack.”32\n\nRecruited as an asset by Russia in the late 1980s, he was accused of providing classified U.S. missile shield and cyber defense information to the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service for millions of dollars. The Estonian government issued Simm",

He was ordered to pay $1.6 million and sentenced to 12 years in prison for damage to security systems.³⁵\n\nIn November 2008, the United States DOD computers were subject to a retaliatory cyber attack thought to originate in Russia.³⁶ The attack spread throughout the computer network via agent.btz malware, which was designed specifically to target military computers. The malware damaged computer networks in U.S. Central Command, including computers used in Iraq and Afghanistan. The attack also penetrated another highly classified DOD network.³⁷ The Pentagon banned all use of flash drives, which was believed to be the method of delivering the malware to the computer network. Several intelligence sources say evidence indicates Russian government involvement, which if correct, would make it the first time a major cyber power successfully invaded classified U.S. military networks.³⁸\n\nIn April 2009, NATO expelled two Russians. One was the son of Vladimir Chizhov, the Russian ambassador to the European Union.³⁹ He and the other diplomat were assigned to Russia's mission to NATO and were suspected of working undercover as spies. The computer systems of NATO and the DOD have since been upgraded with \"enhanced security measures.\"⁴⁰\n\n# RUSSIA-GEORGIA WAR\n\nThe Russia-Georgia War of 2008 may be the first instance of the use of hybrid warfare in which a cyber attack preceded a conventional military strike. Despite the Russian government's denial of involvement in the cyber attack, the planning, servers of Russian state-owned businesses, and timing of the attack suggest some degree of coordination or direction by the Russian government.⁴¹ The cyber attack began with a series of small-scale DDOS attacks in June 2008, two months prior to the five-day war over the breakaway region of South Ossetia.⁴² The cyber attacks made use of botnets, which loaded computers with malicious software. The hackers then ordered the zombie computers to send millions of requests to designated websites to overwhelm the server causing it to shut down. On July 20, several DDOS attacks on President Mikhail Saakashvili's official website caused it to shut down for over 24 hours.⁴³ Reports indicated that the cyber attack came from a \"command-and-control server\" set up several weeks earlier in the United States, which shows that planning and coordination are not confined to national borders.⁴⁴ The U.S.-based server became operational many weeks ahead of the actual attacks, and by August 8, the first day of the war, the rate of cyber attacks had escalated to a very high level. Six botnets launched a coordinated cyber attack on Georgian government and media websites.⁴⁵ The cyber attacks also increased in intensity along with the physical conflict between Russian and Georgian troops. The websites of the President, Parliament, Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the National Bank of Georgia, and the online news agencies of The Messenger and Civil.ge all shut down.

Polish President Lech Kacyznski provided space on his website for official Georgian press releases, and Estonia hosted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and sent two information security specialists to support Georgian cyber defenses.48\n\nReports indicated that StopGeorgia.ru, which was established within hours of Russian forces entering South Ossetia, was a main coordinator of the cyber attacks.49 The forum provided a continuously updated list of target websites. It also encouraged visitors to download DoSHTTP, a free software program, to allow them to participate in the DDOS attacks.50\n\nProject Grey Goose, an independent project launched by cyber specialist Jeff Carr and 100 computer security, technology, and intelligence volunteers, attempted to determine the source of the cyber attacks. Although, the group was unable to verify Russian-sponsorship of StopGeorgia.ru and another website, Xakep.ru, it is still reasonable to conclude a link exists. Russian government members clearly supported the sites' efforts and their implied consent by refusing to take action against the sites to stop the cyber attacks.51 Project Grey Goose also found that the hackers made extensive use of SQL attacks, which are simpler than DDOS attacks. The SQL attacks exploit vulnerabilities within MySQL, a popular open source software which websites commonly use to manage databases. The targeted database is overwhelmed with millions of extraneous queries, shutting down the server. The benefit of using a combined SQL and DDOS attack is that it is very difficult to detect.52 SQL attacks also do not require as many computers to have the same impact as a DDOS attack that cannot be kept up without botnets. The methods used showed “planning, organization, targeted reconnaissance, and evolution of attacks.”53\n\nThe cyber attacks on Georgia in 2008 did not cause nearly the damage that they did in Estonia in 2007 because Georgia's economy and infrastructure are not fully integrated to the Internet—only 7 percent of the country has access to the Internet, with only limited coverage outside Tiblisi.54 Nevertheless, the attacks disrupted timely dissemination of information by the Georgian government and forced it to seek alternative methods for distributing information to the international community.\n\n### China and Cyber Attacks\n\nChina is a main threat to cyber security because of the large number of Internet users and because of the high number of attacks originating in the country that are more sophisticated than other actors.55 China also regards cyber warfare as",

This vision makes sense from China's perspective because it must counter the United States' technological advantage. Cyber attacks from China are not new. China launched cyber attacks in response to U.S. planes bombing the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, and following the crash of a Chinese fighter after it collided with a U.S. surveillance plane. In 2002, U.S. government servers were the target of coordinated cyber attacks, code-named Titan Rain, which originated in China.58 Targeted locations included the U.S. Army Information Systems Engineering Command, the Naval Ocean Systems Center, the Missile Defense Agency, and Sandia National Laboratories. China downloaded between 10 and 20 terabytes of data, or roughly the amount of information contained in the entire Library of Congress. The cyber attacks sought to gain information about military and government activities. China also conducted reconnaissance of the U.S. command and control system, information that it could use in future cyber attacks.59\n\nIn addition to the United States, China has targeted other Western nations. The German Vice President of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution, Hans Elmar Remberg, accused China of carrying out computer network intrusions on an \"almost daily\" basis.60 French Secretary-General of National Defense Francis Delon confirmed that the Chinese had targeted many French government websites in September 2007.61 In November 2007, MI-5 Director Jonathan Evans warned financial service companies that they were the targets of \"state-sponsored computer network exploitation.\"62 In the cyber attacks on the British financial system, the Chinese hackers were suspected of successfully obtaining strategic plans and risk management systems of Lehman brothers, Britain's Bradford &amp; Bingley, and Iceland's Landsbanki.63\n\nChinese hackers associated with the People's Liberation Army (PLA) carried out an attack on Pentagon computer networks that lasted for several weeks in 2007.64 The cyber attacks overpowered the defenses mounted by U.S. military computer experts. The cyber attacks overpowered the defenses mounted by U.S. military computer experts. The Chinese hackers gained accessed to the unclassified computer system that supports the Secretary of Defense. To avoid further damage, the Pentagon shut down the network.65 The cyber attack resulted in the creation of the National Cyber Investigative Joint Task Force to \"coordinate, integrate, and share information related to all domestic cyber threat investigations.\"66\n\nBy 2005, the Chinese PLA had formed \"information warfare militia units\" charged with developing viruses to attack enemy computer systems and networks.67 There are thought to be about 250 hacker groups in China that are either tolerated or encouraged by the government.68 One such group was the Network Crack Program Hacker (NCPH) that had ties to the PLA.

In 2006, NCPH began using these programs to steal millions of unclassified U.S. government documents.⁶⁹ NCPH consisted of eight people in their early 20s who attended Sichuan University. The group first started hacking websites in China, eventually coming to the attention of the Sichuan Military Command Communication Department, which instructed them to participate in a cyber attack network training. After winning the provincial military command competition, the NCPH members entered advanced training consisting of simulated attacks, designing hacking tools, and drafting network-infiltration techniques. Eventually, the NCPH gained a benefactor, likely the PLA, which began subsidizing the group at $270 dollars per month.⁷⁰\n\nChina is interested in aggressively acquiring commercial secrets and information on future weapons systems.⁷¹ The closed and authoritarian nature of the Chinese state and its tight regulation of the Internet make it tough to imagine large hacker communities operating freely without state supervision. The lack of transparency regarding Chinese military modernization and yearly increases in military expenditures is a main concern for the Pentagon. Chinese use of cyber warfare is becoming increasingly sophisticated. Although, the Chinese space program is focused mostly on civilian uses, it is providing the PLA with the ability to track U.S. forces in the western Pacific Ocean. China's advances in cyber technology will jeopardize the U.S. military communication systems that depend on wireless communications and computer networks.⁷² In addition, China is targeting defense contractors, such as Raytheon, Lockheed Martin, Boeing, and Northrop Grumman, all of which have had their unclassified networks penetrated by Chinese hackers. In 2005, Chinese hackers were able to obtain the Army's and Air Force's flight planning software from Redstone Arsenal, Alabama.⁷³ Furthermore, Chinese operations have been detected inside certain U.S. electricity grids. The Chinese have the capability to map electric networks and leave behind malicious software to sabotage networks later. Former DNI McConnell stated he would be surprised if tools and capabilities have not been left in computer and information systems that could be put into action at some time in the future.⁷⁴\n\nCurrent waves of cyber attacks from China are aimed mainly at collecting information and probing defenses. China is likely to continue to exploit U.S. dependence on cyberspace because of low operations costs compared to traditional espionage methods or military activities. Cyber attacks create confusion, and there is no legal framework for cyber warfare.⁷⁵ An international legal framework provides a basis for deterring cyber attacks by creating a cost and international pressure for violating an accepted norm.⁷⁶\n\n## A CYBER ARMS RACE\n\nThe cyber attacks being detected today and the use of hybrid warfare in the Russia-Georgia War are the beginning of a new international race to develop cyber weapons and the defenses to protect against them. As the Internet spreads to ever more distant parts of the world, and national economies become increasingly\n\nLBJ JOURNAL OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS",

China is an advanced technology products exporting power and a leader in the semiconductor industry, which gives it unique access to technology components.77 This access also provides a potential opening for launching cyber attacks.78\n\nIf an imminent attack was detected, some officials argue that the United States should pre-emptively strike the source, ranging from an online attack to a physical strike, as a means to deter future cyber attacks.79 Other officials argue that pre-emptive attacks would provide justification for foreign governments to invest in their own efforts to engage in cyber warfare and to pre-emptively attack the United States.80 With the numbers of hackers and the superior computing ability that comes from harnessing tens of thousands of computers around the world in botnets, someone will find a way to breach a network security system. In the long run, it is not possible to simply build more advanced cyber defenses. The best defense against a cyber attack is to develop a robust capability to engage in cyber war and develop the necessary defenses to mitigate a cyber attack.\n\nThe benefit of Eligible Receiver in the early days of cyber attacks is that federal agencies, research groups, and military contractors now frequently run war games to assess U.S. vulnerabilities. Although President Obama has not spoken openly about whether he supports or opposes cyber weapons, it would be irresponsible not to develop them to protect against attacks. These capabilities are also critical because they can provide vital intelligence, and foreign intelligence services are already using such capabilities, or investing heavily in developing them. U.S. intelligence agencies could activate code embedded in computer chips during the manufacturing process that would enable the U.S. to remotely control an enemy's computers over the Internet. However, the U.S. potentially runs the same risk from computer chips made in China.\n\nCurrently, there is no broad authorization for American forces to engage in cyber war. Former President Bush attempted to include a section to improve U.S. cyber defenses in a classified set of presidential orders in January 2008, but the administration failed to agree on how to write the authorization.81 Instead, President Bush authorized individual uses of cyber warfare in Iraq and Iran.82\n\nIn 2003, the Pentagon and U.S. intelligence agencies made plans for a cyber attack on Saddam Hussein's bank accounts. The plan would have frozen billions of dollars and crippled the Iraqi government's financial system in advance of the U.S. invasion of Iraq. Saddam Hussein would have had no money for war supplies or money to pay troops.83 Bush administration officials were concerned that the plan might not be limited to Iraq, potentially causing global financial disorder, spreading throughout the Middle East to Europe, and to the United States. Therefore, the plan was never carried out. However, President Bush did approve a plan to disable Iraq's military and government communications.84 The U.S. government contacted international communications companies that provided satellite and cell phone coverage in Iraq to warn them about jamming and to request support by turning off their signals. The communications jamming did affect surrounding countries that shared communication systems with Iraq, but the damage was considered\n\nLBJ JOURNAL OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS",

Another cyber attack allowed the U.S. to hack into an Al Qaeda computer and alter information to lead an Al Qaeda group to where U.S. forces were waiting. President Bush also approved an experimental program that would allow the U.S. to slow Iran's progress towards production of a nuclear bomb.⁸⁵\n\n## DISCUSSION\n\nPresident Obama expanded a $17 billion, five-year program, known as the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative, authorized by President Bush in 2008.⁸⁶ In December 2009, President Obama appointed Howard Schmidt to fill the White House cyber security coordinator, after Melissa Hathaway resigned in August 2009, citing delays in the appointment process.⁸⁷ Secretary Robert Gates approved the creation of the U.S. Cyber Command (USCYBERCOMM) headed by the director of the National Security Agency, to be the nation's central hub for cyber capabilities. USCYBERCOMM incorporates the Joint Task Force-Global Network Operations (JTF-GNO) and the Joint Functional Component Command-Network Warfare (JFCC-NW). The organization will build the defenses for military computers and communications systems as well as developing and deploying cyber weapons.⁸⁸ The Pentagon has already commissioned military contractors to develop a classified version of the future Internet, known as the National Cyber Range, on which to test simulated cyber attacks to improve U.S. defenses.⁸⁹\n\nIt is clear the rapid dissemination of information and technology will only magnify the threat of cyber warfare in years to come. The Russian-based attacks on Estonia and Georgia showed how cyber attacks defy state borders and raise difficult issues of jurisdiction. It also shows Russia's preference of using cyber attacks to settle scores with former Soviet states. In addition, China is exhibiting a keen interest in industrial espionage and aggressive intelligence gathering through cyber attacks against Western governments. In April 2011, President Obama announced the National Strategy for Trusted Identities in Cyberspace as a means to increase trustworthiness of identities in online transactions in response to fraud and identity thefts.⁹⁰ The U.S. will have to spearhead the formation of a legal framework for this new challenge, complete with definition of vital terms and rules of the game. The main tenets of warfare embedded in the UN Geneva Conventions will have to be revised to incorporate cyber warfare because it blurs the principles of proportionality, neutrality, and distinction. Yet the most serious problem of cyber warfare is that countries do not know how good the weapons are until they are used.\n\n## ENDNOTES\n\n1.

While cyberspace is often viewed as a virtual world, it is composed of vulnerable physical infrastructure. The vast amount of digital infrastructure that supports the Internet, the economy, the government, and the military makes it nearly impossible to guarantee total security. The more dependent a country becomes on the Internet and the more interconnected its systems become, the more vulnerable the country is to hackers or foreign intelligence services conducting espionage. The National Intelligence Council stated in its most recent quadrennial report, Global Trends 2025: A Transformed World, that the increasing use of cyber warfare is one of the primary factors that \"will constrict U.S. freedom of action.\" It is particularly difficult for the U.S. government to respond to cyber attacks because it is very difficult to track the source of an attack and to determine who initiated it. The international race to build cyber defenses and to develop offensive capabilities, as well as the lack of law governing cyberspace, makes cyber warfare one of the most urgent national security problems facing the United States.\n# CYBERSPACE IS A REAL AND GROWING THREAT\nCyberspace is wrongly viewed as something that cannot be seen, only existing in a virtual form. Cyberspace is real and has very physical components. It exists in the computer systems that enable Wall Street to function and it forms the backbone of all major companies. Cyberspace also exists in the critical infrastructure that allows computers to communicate with each other, such as the main communication trunk line from Europe to the United States that comes up on the New Jersey shore. It plays a major role in the functioning of software, computers, and\nLBJ JOURNAL OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS\nCYBER WARFARE\nSPRING 2012\ncell phones, all of which are now common in daily life. Cyberspace includes the broadband networks, wireless signals, and local area networks in schools. It also encompasses the critical military and intelligence networks designed to protect the United States. While the Internet has made society more interconnected than at any time in history, it has also made it easier for domestic and foreign hackers to disrupt daily life.\nCyber attack refers to a deliberate action to \"alter, disrupt, deceive, degrade, or destroy\" networks, computer systems, or programs that may be contained on a computer or moving through a system.² A cyber attack generally involves penetrating a computer network as a means to disrupt an opponent's critical services, such as accessing a utility control system. Groups that operate independently or with state sponsorship that can gain access to intellectual property or classified military information are a growing threat. However, there are legitimate uses of cyber attacks. The United States prepares to conduct cyber attacks in conjunction with other information warfare methods and with conventional attacks to protect national security. Domestic law enforcement also engages in cyber attacks when jamming devices are used to prevent cell phone calls when suspected to be used to detonate a bomb.\nCyber attacks became much more common during the late 1990s, including such cases as the 1998 Internet Worm, Melissa Virus, I-LOVE-YOU virus, Code Red Virus, and the Nimda Virus. Initially, attacks consisted of malware, such as viruses and worms. Today, cyber attacks are increasingly sophisticated and adaptive. Security breaches and information theft are commonplace in the news. Foreign intelligence services from countries such as China, Israel, Iran, Russia, and the United States have used cyber capabilities defensively and offensively.\nThe first major test of the U.S. government's cyber infrastructure from cyber attacks was Eligible Receiver in June 1997, a Joint Staff test exercise run by the Department of Defense (DOD).³ The unannounced exercise targeted 20 different agencies and revealed significant vulnerabilities within the U.S. government's information infrastructures. A team of 35 computer experts from the National Security Agency split into four teams to simulate hackers trying to penetrate U.S. computer networks. The teams used publicly available information and tools found on the Internet and commercial Internet accounts to exploit actual vulnerabilities. Over the next two weeks they successfully hacked into power grids of nine U.S. cities and cracked their 911 emergency systems. They also attacked the Pentagon's computer networks, gaining access to 36 of them. Only two of the attacks were detected. Once inside the systems, the teams had complete access and were able to issue fake orders and news reports about the crisis. As a result, no one in the entire chain of command could be certain of what was accurate. If it had been a real attack, the four teams would have been able to prevent the United States from responding effectively.⁴\nThe severity of security challenges posed by cyber warfare to any country is highly related to the degree of its dependence on modern information and communications technology. Countries with advanced internet accessibility, including widespread online commerce and banking, possess far more vulnerabilities to at-\nLBJ JOURNAL OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS\nVOL. 20\nCYBER WARFARE\n25\ntack. Countries with limited reliance on information technology (IT) are much less exposed, but still susceptible to cyber attacks. For example, an undercover Defense Department employee said that it would be possible to hit three undisclosed communication \"nodes\" in the United States and severely impair communications across the country.⁵ The Department of Energy conducted an experiment, the Aurora Generator Test, to determine if a 27-ton power generator could be disabled using the Internet.⁶ The group of scientists was able to hack into the control system and use the controls to cause the generator to shudder, overheat, and eventually to fatally malfunction. In a real world scenario, losing several large power generators would cause a prolonged disruption. The generators are expensive, made overseas, and require up to four months to obtain. A well-targeted cyber attack could shut down a power plant for months.⁷ The power grid is one of the most vulnerable infrastructure systems to cyber attack in part because it is operated by private utilities that are not required to comply with government security decrees.⁸ With the move toward a Smart Grid, which relies on interconnected networks of computer-controlled nodes, its vulnerability could increase because each node would operate automatically over the Internet to regulate the flow of power. If the nodes are not secure, they can be hacked and used to disrupt the delivery of electricity.⁹ Additionally, there are only about five software systems used to run power grids, dams, utilities, and pipelines that rely on wireless supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems in which one node provides instructions to another node in the chain. If compromised, the SCADA system could send fake instructions, potentially causing severe damage to critical infrastructure. One of the benefits of the outdated air traffic control system in the U.S. is that because it is so old, it is not directly connected to the Internet, and is less susceptible to a cyber attack.¹⁰\nEvery day there are thousands of cyber attacks on federal and private computer systems. The DOD estimated that in 2007 there were 43,880 incidents of malicious activity from all sources on five million computers, a 31 percent increase from 2006.¹¹ Some attacks are malicious, but others appear to be testing the chinks in the patchwork of firewalls. The most dangerous aspect is the attacks that go undetected by common security tools. The number of attacks is increasing and they are becoming increasingly bold. In January 2008, a Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) official stated that the CIA knew hackers had disrupted or threatened to disrupt power in four foreign cities.¹² The enormous challenge of defending cyber infrastructure ranges from forensic tasks to determine attack attribution to the broader concern of proportionality of a response and what is considered a legitimate target.\nA CSIS panel researched potential vulnerabilities and determined that the main threat is not the capabilities of individual hackers but the capabilities of other nations, such as China and Russia. Team Cymru, a research company, reviewed Internet scans that attempted to enter industrial control systems. Scans originated from 14 different countries, including China, Iran, Israel, Russia, Taiwan, and even the United States. The Team Cymru results showed that 90 percent of the scans originated in China.¹³\nLBJ JOURNAL OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS\nCYBER WARFARE\nSPRING 2012\nAlthough scanning alone does not cause any damage to computer systems, it could be a preliminary step in an actual attack that would scramble databases or control computers. Former Director of National Intelligence (DNI) Mike McConnell told President Bush in 2007 that if a large U.S. bank were successfully hacked, \"it would have an order-of-magnitude greater impact on the global economy\" than the September 11, 2001, attacks. McConnell warned, \"the ability to threaten the U.S. money supply is the equivalent of today's nuclear weapon.\"14 A cyber attack on the banking system could shut down the system that clears all financial transactions, thus undermining all confidence in the monetary system.\nIn a cyber war, it is difficult to determine the source of an attack or the attacker's identity. The ability to backtrack a cyber attack to the source depends on a rapid response capability on the order of seconds, minutes, or hours. The pathways used by hackers may only be active for milliseconds and often there is no identifying evidence that remains once the hacker has completed his objective. In the case of the Team Cymru study, the team could not identify whether military organizations, intelligence agencies, terrorists, criminals, or inventive individuals were the source of the cyber attacks.[15] Even if the physical origin of an attack can be identified, there is no guarantee that the hacker behind the attack is sponsored by that country or that the hacker is even located within the given country.[16]\nA new type of cyber warfare that is growing is hybrid warfare.[17] National governments rather than individual hackers carry out this type of attack. Hybrid warfare is a cyber attack that is timed to coincide with a conventional military offensive. A cyber attack using mass communication sources in conjunction with a conventional military attack may also be used to influence global public opinion.[18] Hybrid warfare is particularly threatening because it is designed to prevent an effective response by the targeted country to a physical attack.\nAn offensive tool in the cyber arsenal is the botnet, a collection of computers that have been compromised by malicious software. The program commandeers the infected machines, creating a vast network. The compromised computers, known as \"zombies,\" can be remotely controlled, often without the knowledge of anyone using the zombie computer. The zombie network can be instructed to attack a designated target by overwhelming it with thousands of commands.[19] In an actual cyber war, a successful cyber attack would target computer-dependent infrastructure, such as a nation's power grid or banking system. Also, an attack on a nation's air traffic control system could blind the air traffic controllers' air defense networks, hindering an effective counterstrike.[20]\n# USE OF CYBER WARFARE BY FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE SERVICES\n## CYBER ATTACK ON ESTONIA\nIn 2007, Estonia was subject to a prolonged cyber attack suspected of being sponsored by Russia. Estonia, a developed former Soviet Republic, has a high level of access to advanced communications technology. The Estonian government shifted all of its major government operations to the Internet in 2005. The government\nLBJ JOURNAL OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS\nholds all cabinet meetings online and documents are signed with e-signatures. Beginning in March 2007, Estonians can even vote online.21 Over 60 percent of the population has online access to bank accounts and 95 percent of banking transactions are online.22 Russian hackers were patiently waiting for a pretext to test Estonia's cyber defenses.\nIn April 2007, the Estonian government decided to relocate a monument that commemorated the Soviet armed forces' contribution to liberating Estonia from Nazi control during World War II. Moving the monument from the center of Tallinn, the capital, to a military cemetery outside the city sparked protests and riots among the Russian minority. The event may have provided the pretext, and the unrest was closely followed by distributed denial of service (DDOS) attacks originating in Russia.23 A call to action and step-by-step instructions about how to carry out DDOS attacks spread through Russian chat rooms. The Estonian government websites that normally received 1,000 visitors per day suddenly started receiving 2,000 visits per second.24 Anyone who attempted to access the target sites had their computer screens frozen.25 The websites of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Justice shut down, and the Prime Minister Andrus Ansip's Reform Party website was defaced by the addition of an image of Prime Minister Ansip with an Adolf Hitler mustache. The Russian hackers also briefly disabled the national emergency phone number.26\nThe United States and NATO sent computer security teams to aid the Estonian authorities to cope with the DDOS waves that overpowered the country's government websites, banking industry, and media organizations. The clandestine groups of hackers were not confirmed to be operating with Russian sponsorship, but evidence suggests the Russian authorities were at least complicit.27 The unusual aspect of the attacks was that they lasted for several weeks and had a very high intensity. Some of the botnets used in the DDOS attacks included up to 100,000 zombie computers. The commandeered computers directed large amounts of data at Estonia's government websites and banking system.28 The US-NATO efforts stabilized the situation, but intermittent attacks continued until mid-May 2007.29\nIn response to the cyber attacks, NATO established the Cooperative Defense Center in Estonia in May 2008. The center is staffed by 30 cyber specialists and is part of NATO's network of Centers of Excellence accredited to train representatives from member states about technical aspects of NATO operations.30 However, the new center's vulnerability was shown with the capture of Herman Simm in September 2008, which also further implicated Russia in the cyber attack on Estonia.31\nHerman Simm, 61, was a high ranking official working in the Estonian Ministry of Defense. In 2001, he was appointed head of the State Secret Protection Office. He also developed the information protection systems for NATO and the European Union, frequently leading Estonian talks on protecting classified data. He was described as being “at the cutting edge of NATO's most important new strategic missions: to defend the alliance against cyber-attack.”32\nRecruited as an asset by Russia in the late 1980s, he was accused of providing classified U.S. missile shield and cyber defense information to the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service for millions of dollars. The Estonian government issued Simm\nCYBER WARFARE\nSPRING 2012\na diplomatic passport that he used to personally transfer documents abroad.³³ Although it is unknown if he had other accomplices within the government, Simm oversaw the issuance of security clearances for Estonian intelligence, military, and security agencies.³⁴ An Estonian court convicted Simm of treason in February 2009. He was ordered to pay $1.6 million and sentenced to 12 years in prison for damage to security systems.³⁵\nIn November 2008, the United States DOD computers were subject to a retaliatory cyber attack thought to originate in Russia.³⁶ The attack spread throughout the computer network via agent.btz malware, which was designed specifically to target military computers. The malware damaged computer networks in U.S. Central Command, including computers used in Iraq and Afghanistan. The attack also penetrated another highly classified DOD network.³⁷ The Pentagon banned all use of flash drives, which was believed to be the method of delivering the malware to the computer network. Several intelligence sources say evidence indicates Russian government involvement, which if correct, would make it the first time a major cyber power successfully invaded classified U.S. military networks.³⁸\nIn April 2009, NATO expelled two Russians. One was the son of Vladimir Chizhov, the Russian ambassador to the European Union.³⁹ He and the other diplomat were assigned to Russia's mission to NATO and were suspected of working undercover as spies. The computer systems of NATO and the DOD have since been upgraded with \"enhanced security measures.\"⁴⁰\n# RUSSIA-GEORGIA WAR\nThe Russia-Georgia War of 2008 may be the first instance of the use of hybrid warfare in which a cyber attack preceded a conventional military strike. Despite the Russian government's denial of involvement in the cyber attack, the planning, servers of Russian state-owned businesses, and timing of the attack suggest some degree of coordination or direction by the Russian government.⁴¹ The cyber attack began with a series of small-scale DDOS attacks in June 2008, two months prior to the five-day war over the breakaway region of South Ossetia.⁴² The cyber attacks made use of botnets, which loaded computers with malicious software. The hackers then ordered the zombie computers to send millions of requests to designated websites to overwhelm the server causing it to shut down. On July 20, several DDOS attacks on President Mikhail Saakashvili's official website caused it to shut down for over 24 hours.⁴³ Reports indicated that the cyber attack came from a \"command-and-control server\" set up several weeks earlier in the United States, which shows that planning and coordination are not confined to national borders.⁴⁴ The U.S.-based server became operational many weeks ahead of the actual attacks, and by August 8, the first day of the war, the rate of cyber attacks had escalated to a very high level. Six botnets launched a coordinated cyber attack on Georgian government and media websites.⁴⁵ The cyber attacks also increased in intensity along with the physical conflict between Russian and Georgian troops. The websites of the President, Parliament, Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the National Bank of Georgia, and the online news agencies of The Messenger and Civil.ge all shut down. The websites of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the\nLBJ JOURNAL OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS\nNational Bank were defaced by adding images comparing Saakashvili with Adolf Hitler.46 Although defacing a government website has a visual impact, shutting down online media sources during a military attack is characteristic of information warfare with the intent to disrupt communication and prevent dissemination of accurate information.\nThe Georgian government reacted by requesting permission from Google to transfer the websites of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Civil.ge to the Blogspot domain, which were better protected from the DDOS attacks.47 Atlanta-based Tulip Systems, Inc. agreed to host the President's website. Polish President Lech Kacyznski provided space on his website for official Georgian press releases, and Estonia hosted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and sent two information security specialists to support Georgian cyber defenses.48\nReports indicated that StopGeorgia.ru, which was established within hours of Russian forces entering South Ossetia, was a main coordinator of the cyber attacks.49 The forum provided a continuously updated list of target websites. It also encouraged visitors to download DoSHTTP, a free software program, to allow them to participate in the DDOS attacks.50\nProject Grey Goose, an independent project launched by cyber specialist Jeff Carr and 100 computer security, technology, and intelligence volunteers, attempted to determine the source of the cyber attacks. Although, the group was unable to verify Russian-sponsorship of StopGeorgia.ru and another website, Xakep.ru, it is still reasonable to conclude a link exists. Russian government members clearly supported the sites' efforts and their implied consent by refusing to take action against the sites to stop the cyber attacks.51 Project Grey Goose also found that the hackers made extensive use of SQL attacks, which are simpler than DDOS attacks. The SQL attacks exploit vulnerabilities within MySQL, a popular open source software which websites commonly use to manage databases. The targeted database is overwhelmed with millions of extraneous queries, shutting down the server. The benefit of using a combined SQL and DDOS attack is that it is very difficult to detect.52 SQL attacks also do not require as many computers to have the same impact as a DDOS attack that cannot be kept up without botnets. The methods used showed “planning, organization, targeted reconnaissance, and evolution of attacks.”53\nThe cyber attacks on Georgia in 2008 did not cause nearly the damage that they did in Estonia in 2007 because Georgia's economy and infrastructure are not fully integrated to the Internet—only 7 percent of the country has access to the Internet, with only limited coverage outside Tiblisi.54 Nevertheless, the attacks disrupted timely dissemination of information by the Georgian government and forced it to seek alternative methods for distributing information to the international community.\n### China and Cyber Attacks\nChina is a main threat to cyber security because of the large number of Internet users and because of the high number of attacks originating in the country that are more sophisticated than other actors.55 China also regards cyber warfare as\nCYBER WARFARE\nSPRING 2012\na central component in future conflicts, such as with the United States, where a direct confrontation would be difficult.56 This is an example of asymmetric warfare, where one actor, a country or non-state entity, undermines another country's strength by exploiting its weaknesses.57 Asymmetric conflict involves a tactical operation whose objective is to prevent the opponent from engaging in battle. This vision makes sense from China's perspective because it must counter the United States' technological advantage. Cyber attacks from China are not new. China launched cyber attacks in response to U.S. planes bombing the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, and following the crash of a Chinese fighter after it collided with a U.S. surveillance plane. In 2002, U.S. government servers were the target of coordinated cyber attacks, code-named Titan Rain, which originated in China.58 Targeted locations included the U.S. Army Information Systems Engineering Command, the Naval Ocean Systems Center, the Missile Defense Agency, and Sandia National Laboratories. China downloaded between 10 and 20 terabytes of data, or roughly the amount of information contained in the entire Library of Congress. The cyber attacks sought to gain information about military and government activities. China also conducted reconnaissance of the U.S. command and control system, information that it could use in future cyber attacks.59\nIn addition to the United States, China has targeted other Western nations. The German Vice President of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution, Hans Elmar Remberg, accused China of carrying out computer network intrusions on an \"almost daily\" basis.60 French Secretary-General of National Defense Francis Delon confirmed that the Chinese had targeted many French government websites in September 2007.61 In November 2007, MI-5 Director Jonathan Evans warned financial service companies that they were the targets of \"state-sponsored computer network exploitation.\"62 In the cyber attacks on the British financial system, the Chinese hackers were suspected of successfully obtaining strategic plans and risk management systems of Lehman brothers, Britain's Bradford &amp; Bingley, and Iceland's Landsbanki.63\nChinese hackers associated with the People's Liberation Army (PLA) carried out an attack on Pentagon computer networks that lasted for several weeks in 2007.64 The cyber attacks overpowered the defenses mounted by U.S. military computer experts. The cyber attacks overpowered the defenses mounted by U.S. military computer experts. The Chinese hackers gained accessed to the unclassified computer system that supports the Secretary of Defense. To avoid further damage, the Pentagon shut down the network.65 The cyber attack resulted in the creation of the National Cyber Investigative Joint Task Force to \"coordinate, integrate, and share information related to all domestic cyber threat investigations.\"66\nBy 2005, the Chinese PLA had formed \"information warfare militia units\" charged with developing viruses to attack enemy computer systems and networks.67 There are thought to be about 250 hacker groups in China that are either tolerated or encouraged by the government.68 One such group was the Network Crack Program Hacker (NCPH) that had ties to the PLA. NCPH developed software that allowed remote control of network programs, enabling the organization to steal government documents. NCPH also took advantage of holes in Microsoft Of\nLBJ JOURNAL OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS\nVOL. 20\nCYBER WARFARE\n31\nfice to insert Trojans that took partial control of the computers to extract files. In 2006, NCPH began using these programs to steal millions of unclassified U.S. government documents.⁶⁹ NCPH consisted of eight people in their early 20s who attended Sichuan University. The group first started hacking websites in China, eventually coming to the attention of the Sichuan Military Command Communication Department, which instructed them to participate in a cyber attack network training. After winning the provincial military command competition, the NCPH members entered advanced training consisting of simulated attacks, designing hacking tools, and drafting network-infiltration techniques. Eventually, the NCPH gained a benefactor, likely the PLA, which began subsidizing the group at $270 dollars per month.⁷⁰\nChina is interested in aggressively acquiring commercial secrets and information on future weapons systems.⁷¹ The closed and authoritarian nature of the Chinese state and its tight regulation of the Internet make it tough to imagine large hacker communities operating freely without state supervision. The lack of transparency regarding Chinese military modernization and yearly increases in military expenditures is a main concern for the Pentagon. Chinese use of cyber warfare is becoming increasingly sophisticated. Although, the Chinese space program is focused mostly on civilian uses, it is providing the PLA with the ability to track U.S. forces in the western Pacific Ocean. China's advances in cyber technology will jeopardize the U.S. military communication systems that depend on wireless communications and computer networks.⁷² In addition, China is targeting defense contractors, such as Raytheon, Lockheed Martin, Boeing, and Northrop Grumman, all of which have had their unclassified networks penetrated by Chinese hackers. In 2005, Chinese hackers were able to obtain the Army's and Air Force's flight planning software from Redstone Arsenal, Alabama.⁷³ Furthermore, Chinese operations have been detected inside certain U.S. electricity grids. The Chinese have the capability to map electric networks and leave behind malicious software to sabotage networks later. Former DNI McConnell stated he would be surprised if tools and capabilities have not been left in computer and information systems that could be put into action at some time in the future.⁷⁴\nCurrent waves of cyber attacks from China are aimed mainly at collecting information and probing defenses. China is likely to continue to exploit U.S. dependence on cyberspace because of low operations costs compared to traditional espionage methods or military activities. Cyber attacks create confusion, and there is no legal framework for cyber warfare.⁷⁵ An international legal framework provides a basis for deterring cyber attacks by creating a cost and international pressure for violating an accepted norm.⁷⁶\n## A CYBER ARMS RACE\nThe cyber attacks being detected today and the use of hybrid warfare in the Russia-Georgia War are the beginning of a new international race to develop cyber weapons and the defenses to protect against them. As the Internet spreads to ever more distant parts of the world, and national economies become increasingly\nLBJ JOURNAL OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS\nCYBER WARFARE\nSPRING 2012\nintegrated into the World Wide Web, the desire to acquire both offensive and defensive cyber capabilities by states and non-state actors will multiply. China is an advanced technology products exporting power and a leader in the semiconductor industry, which gives it unique access to technology components.77 This access also provides a potential opening for launching cyber attacks.78\nIf an imminent attack was detected, some officials argue that the United States should pre-emptively strike the source, ranging from an online attack to a physical strike, as a means to deter future cyber attacks.79 Other officials argue that pre-emptive attacks would provide justification for foreign governments to invest in their own efforts to engage in cyber warfare and to pre-emptively attack the United States.80 With the numbers of hackers and the superior computing ability that comes from harnessing tens of thousands of computers around the world in botnets, someone will find a way to breach a network security system. In the long run, it is not possible to simply build more advanced cyber defenses. The best defense against a cyber attack is to develop a robust capability to engage in cyber war and develop the necessary defenses to mitigate a cyber attack.\nThe benefit of Eligible Receiver in the early days of cyber attacks is that federal agencies, research groups, and military contractors now frequently run war games to assess U.S. vulnerabilities. Although President Obama has not spoken openly about whether he supports or opposes cyber weapons, it would be irresponsible not to develop them to protect against attacks. These capabilities are also critical because they can provide vital intelligence, and foreign intelligence services are already using such capabilities, or investing heavily in developing them. U.S. intelligence agencies could activate code embedded in computer chips during the manufacturing process that would enable the U.S. to remotely control an enemy's computers over the Internet. However, the U.S. potentially runs the same risk from computer chips made in China.\nCurrently, there is no broad authorization for American forces to engage in cyber war. Former President Bush attempted to include a section to improve U.S. cyber defenses in a classified set of presidential orders in January 2008, but the administration failed to agree on how to write the authorization.81 Instead, President Bush authorized individual uses of cyber warfare in Iraq and Iran.82\nIn 2003, the Pentagon and U.S. intelligence agencies made plans for a cyber attack on Saddam Hussein's bank accounts. The plan would have frozen billions of dollars and crippled the Iraqi government's financial system in advance of the U.S. invasion of Iraq. Saddam Hussein would have had no money for war supplies or money to pay troops.83 Bush administration officials were concerned that the plan might not be limited to Iraq, potentially causing global financial disorder, spreading throughout the Middle East to Europe, and to the United States. Therefore, the plan was never carried out. However, President Bush did approve a plan to disable Iraq's military and government communications.84 The U.S. government contacted international communications companies that provided satellite and cell phone coverage in Iraq to warn them about jamming and to request support by turning off their signals. The communications jamming did affect surrounding countries that shared communication systems with Iraq, but the damage was considered\nLBJ JOURNAL OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS\nVOL. 20\nCYBER WARFARE\n33\nacceptable by the Bush administration. Another cyber attack allowed the U.S. to hack into an Al Qaeda computer and alter information to lead an Al Qaeda group to where U.S. forces were waiting. President Bush also approved an experimental program that would allow the U.S. to slow Iran's progress towards production of a nuclear bomb.⁸⁵\n## DISCUSSION\nPresident Obama expanded a $17 billion, five-year program, known as the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative, authorized by President Bush in 2008.⁸⁶ In December 2009, President Obama appointed Howard Schmidt to fill the White House cyber security coordinator, after Melissa Hathaway resigned in August 2009, citing delays in the appointment process.⁸⁷ Secretary Robert Gates approved the creation of the U.S. Cyber Command (USCYBERCOMM) headed by the director of the National Security Agency, to be the nation's central hub for cyber capabilities. USCYBERCOMM incorporates the Joint Task Force-Global Network Operations (JTF-GNO) and the Joint Functional Component Command-Network Warfare (JFCC-NW). The organization will build the defenses for military computers and communications systems as well as developing and deploying cyber weapons.⁸⁸ The Pentagon has already commissioned military contractors to develop a classified version of the future Internet, known as the National Cyber Range, on which to test simulated cyber attacks to improve U.S. defenses.⁸⁹\nIt is clear the rapid dissemination of information and technology will only magnify the threat of cyber warfare in years to come. The Russian-based attacks on Estonia and Georgia showed how cyber attacks defy state borders and raise difficult issues of jurisdiction. It also shows Russia's preference of using cyber attacks to settle scores with former Soviet states. In addition, China is exhibiting a keen interest in industrial espionage and aggressive intelligence gathering through cyber attacks against Western governments. In April 2011, President Obama announced the National Strategy for Trusted Identities in Cyberspace as a means to increase trustworthiness of identities in online transactions in response to fraud and identity thefts.⁹⁰ The U.S. will have to spearhead the formation of a legal framework for this new challenge, complete with definition of vital terms and rules of the game. The main tenets of warfare embedded in the UN Geneva Conventions will have to be revised to incorporate cyber warfare because it blurs the principles of proportionality, neutrality, and distinction. Yet the most serious problem of cyber warfare is that countries do not know how good the weapons are until they are used.\n## ENDNOTES\n1.

While cyberspace is often viewed as a virtual world, it is composed of vulnerable physical infrastructure. The vast amount of digital infrastructure that supports the Internet, the economy, the government, and the military makes it nearly impossible to guarantee total security. The more dependent a country becomes on the Internet and the more interconnected its systems become, the more vulnerable the country is to hackers or foreign intelligence services conducting espionage. The National Intelligence Council stated in its most recent quadrennial report, Global Trends 2025: A Transformed World, that the increasing use of cyber warfare is one of the primary factors that\"will constrict U.S. freedom of action.\"It is particularly difficult for the U.S. government to respond to cyber attacks because it is very difficult to track the source of an attack and to determine who initiated it. The international race to build cyber defenses and to develop offensive capabilities, as well as the lack of law governing cyberspace, makes cyber warfare one of the most urgent national security problems facing the United States.\n# CYBERSPACE IS A REAL AND GROWING THREAT Cyberspace is wrongly viewed as something that cannot be seen, only existing in a virtual form. Cyberspace is real and has very physical components. It exists in the computer systems that enable Wall Street to function and it forms the backbone of all major companies. Cyberspace also exists in the critical infrastructure that allows computers to communicate with each other, such as the main communication trunk line from Europe to the United States that comes up on the New Jersey shore. It plays a major role in the functioning of software, computers, and LBJ JOURNAL OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS CYBER WARFARE SPRING 2012 cell phones, all of which are now common in daily life. Cyberspace includes the broadband networks, wireless signals, and local area networks in schools. It also encompasses the critical military and intelligence networks designed to protect the United States. While the Internet has made society more interconnected than at any time in history, it has also made it easier for domestic and foreign hackers to disrupt daily life.\nCyber attack refers to a deliberate action to\"alter, disrupt, deceive, degrade, or destroy\"networks, computer systems, or programs that may be contained on a computer or moving through a system.² A cyber attack generally involves penetrating a computer network as a means to disrupt an opponent's critical services, such as accessing a utility control system. Groups that operate independently or with state sponsorship that can gain access to intellectual property or classified military information are a growing threat. However, there are legitimate uses of cyber attacks. The United States prepares to conduct cyber attacks in conjunction with other information warfare methods and with conventional attacks to protect national security. Domestic law enforcement also engages in cyber attacks when jamming devices are used to prevent cell phone calls when suspected to be used to detonate a bomb.\nCyber attacks became much more common during the late 1990s, including such cases as the 1998 Internet Worm, Melissa Virus, I-LOVE-YOU virus, Code Red Virus, and the Nimda Virus. Initially, attacks consisted of malware, such as viruses and worms. Today, cyber attacks are increasingly sophisticated and adaptive. Security breaches and information theft are commonplace in the news. Foreign intelligence services from countries such as China, Israel, Iran, Russia, and the United States have used cyber capabilities defensively and offensively.\nThe first major test of the U.S. government's cyber infrastructure from cyber attacks was Eligible Receiver in June 1997, a Joint Staff test exercise run by the Department of Defense (DOD).³ The unannounced exercise targeted 20 different agencies and revealed significant vulnerabilities within the U.S. government's information infrastructures. A team of 35 computer experts from the National Security Agency split into four teams to simulate hackers trying to penetrate U.S. computer networks. The teams used publicly available information and tools found on the Internet and commercial Internet accounts to exploit actual vulnerabilities. Over the next two weeks they successfully hacked into power grids of nine U.S. cities and cracked their 911 emergency systems. They also attacked the Pentagon's computer networks, gaining access to 36 of them. Only two of the attacks were detected. Once inside the systems, the teams had complete access and were able to issue fake orders and news reports about the crisis. As a result, no one in the entire chain of command could be certain of what was accurate. If it had been a real attack, the four teams would have been able to prevent the United States from responding effectively.⁴ The severity of security challenges posed by cyber warfare to any country is highly related to the degree of its dependence on modern information and communications technology. Countries with advanced internet accessibility, including widespread online commerce and banking, possess far more vulnerabilities to at- LBJ JOURNAL OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS VOL. 20 CYBER WARFARE Every day there are thousands of cyber attacks on federal and private computer systems. The DOD estimated that in 2007 there were 43,880 incidents of malicious activity from all sources on five million computers, a 31 percent increase from 2006.¹¹ Some attacks are malicious, but others appear to be testing the chinks in the patchwork of firewalls. The most dangerous aspect is the attacks that go undetected by common security tools. The number of attacks is increasing and they are becoming increasingly bold. In January 2008, a Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) official stated that the CIA knew hackers had disrupted or threatened to disrupt power in four foreign cities.¹² The enormous challenge of defending cyber infrastructure ranges from forensic tasks to determine attack attribution to the broader concern of proportionality of a response and what is considered a legitimate target.\nA CSIS panel researched potential vulnerabilities and determined that the main threat is not the capabilities of individual hackers but the capabilities of other nations, such as China and Russia. Team Cymru, a research company, reviewed Internet scans that attempted to enter industrial control systems. Scans originated from 14 different countries, including China, Iran, Israel, Russia, Taiwan, and even the United States. The Team Cymru results showed that 90 percent of the scans originated in China.¹³ LBJ JOURNAL OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS CYBER WARFARE SPRING 2012 Although scanning alone does not cause any damage to computer systems, it could be a preliminary step in an actual attack that would scramble databases or control computers. Former Director of National Intelligence (DNI) Mike McConnell told President Bush in 2007 that if a large U.S. bank were successfully hacked,\"it would have an order-of-magnitude greater impact on the global economy\"than the September 11, 2001, attacks. McConnell warned,\"the ability to threaten the U.S. money supply is the equivalent of today's nuclear weapon.\"14 A cyber attack on the banking system could shut down the system that clears all financial transactions, thus undermining all confidence in the monetary system.\nIn a cyber war, it is difficult to determine the source of an attack or the attacker's identity. The ability to backtrack a cyber attack to the source depends on a rapid response capability on the order of seconds, minutes, or hours. The pathways used by hackers may only be active for milliseconds and often there is no identifying evidence that remains once the hacker has completed his objective. In the case of the Team Cymru study, the team could not identify whether military organizations, intelligence agencies, terrorists, criminals, or inventive individuals were the source of the cyber attacks.[15] Even if the physical origin of an attack can be identified, there is no guarantee that the hacker behind the attack is sponsored by that country or that the hacker is even located within the given country.[16] A new type of cyber warfare that is growing is hybrid warfare.[17] National governments rather than individual hackers carry out this type of attack. Hybrid warfare is a cyber attack that is timed to coincide with a conventional military offensive. A cyber attack using mass communication sources in conjunction with a conventional military attack may also be used to influence global public opinion.[18] Hybrid warfare is particularly threatening because it is designed to prevent an effective response by the targeted country to a physical attack.\nAn offensive tool in the cyber arsenal is the botnet, a collection of computers that have been compromised by malicious software. The program commandeers the infected machines, creating a vast network. The compromised computers, known as\"zombies,\"can be remotely controlled, often without the knowledge of anyone using the zombie computer. The zombie network can be instructed to attack a designated target by overwhelming it with thousands of commands.[19] In an actual cyber war, a successful cyber attack would target computer-dependent infrastructure, such as a nation's power grid or banking system. Also, an attack on a nation's air traffic control system could blind the air traffic controllers' air defense networks, hindering an effective counterstrike.[20] # USE OF CYBER WARFARE BY FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE SERVICES ## CYBER ATTACK ON ESTONIA In 2007, Estonia was subject to a prolonged cyber attack suspected of being sponsored by Russia. Estonia, a developed former Soviet Republic, has a high level of access to advanced communications technology. The Estonian government shifted all of its major government operations to the Internet in 2005. The government LBJ JOURNAL OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS holds all cabinet meetings online and documents are signed with e-signatures. Beginning in March 2007, Estonians can even vote online.21 Over 60 percent of the population has online access to bank accounts and 95 percent of banking transactions are online.22 Russian hackers were patiently waiting for a pretext to test Estonia's cyber defenses.\nIn April 2007, the Estonian government decided to relocate a monument that commemorated the Soviet armed forces' contribution to liberating Estonia from Nazi control during World War II. Moving the monument from the center of Tallinn, the capital, to a military cemetery outside the city sparked protests and riots among the Russian minority. The event may have provided the pretext, and the unrest was closely followed by distributed denial of service (DDOS) attacks originating in Russia.23 A call to action and step-by-step instructions about how to carry out DDOS attacks spread through Russian chat rooms. The Estonian government websites that normally received 1,000 visitors per day suddenly started receiving 2,000 visits per second.24 Anyone who attempted to access the target sites had their computer screens frozen.25 The websites of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Justice shut down, and the Prime Minister Andrus Ansip's Reform Party website was defaced by the addition of an image of Prime Minister Ansip with an Adolf Hitler mustache. The Russian hackers also briefly disabled the national emergency phone number.26 The United States and NATO sent computer security teams to aid the Estonian authorities to cope with the DDOS waves that overpowered the country's government websites, banking industry, and media organizations. The clandestine groups of hackers were not confirmed to be operating with Russian sponsorship, but evidence suggests the Russian authorities were at least complicit.27 The unusual aspect of the attacks was that they lasted for several weeks and had a very high intensity. Some of the botnets used in the DDOS attacks included up to 100,000 zombie computers. The commandeered computers directed large amounts of data at Estonia's government websites and banking system.28 The US-NATO efforts stabilized the situation, but intermittent attacks continued until mid-May 2007.29 In response to the cyber attacks, NATO established the Cooperative Defense Center in Estonia in May 2008. The center is staffed by 30 cyber specialists and is part of NATO's network of Centers of Excellence accredited to train representatives from member states about technical aspects of NATO operations.30 However, the new center's vulnerability was shown with the capture of Herman Simm in September 2008, which also further implicated Russia in the cyber attack on Estonia.31 Herman Simm, 61, was a high ranking official working in the Estonian Ministry of Defense. In 2001, he was appointed head of the State Secret Protection Office. He also developed the information protection systems for NATO and the European Union, frequently leading Estonian talks on protecting classified data. He was described as being “at the cutting edge of NATO's most important new strategic missions: to defend the alliance against cyber-attack.”32 Recruited as an asset by Russia in the late 1980s, he was accused of providing classified U.S. missile shield and cyber defense information to the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service for millions of dollars. The Estonian government issued Simm CYBER WARFARE SPRING 2012 a diplomatic passport that he used to personally transfer documents abroad.³³ Although it is unknown if he had other accomplices within the government, Simm oversaw the issuance of security clearances for Estonian intelligence, military, and security agencies.³⁴ An Estonian court convicted Simm of treason in February 2009. He was ordered to pay $1.6 million and sentenced to 12 years in prison for damage to security systems.³⁵ In November 2008, the United States DOD computers were subject to a retaliatory cyber attack thought to originate in Russia.³⁶ The attack spread throughout the computer network via agent.btz malware, which was designed specifically to target military computers. The malware damaged computer networks in U.S. Central Command, including computers used in Iraq and Afghanistan. The attack also penetrated another highly classified DOD network.³⁷ The Pentagon banned all use of flash drives, which was believed to be the method of delivering the malware to the computer network. Several intelligence sources say evidence indicates Russian government involvement, which if correct, would make it the first time a major cyber power successfully invaded classified U.S. military networks.³⁸ In April 2009, NATO expelled two Russians. One was the son of Vladimir Chizhov, the Russian ambassador to the European Union.³⁹ He and the other diplomat were assigned to Russia's mission to NATO and were suspected of working undercover as spies. The computer systems of NATO and the DOD have since been upgraded with\"enhanced security measures.\"⁴⁰ # RUSSIA-GEORGIA WAR The Russia-Georgia War of 2008 may be the first instance of the use of hybrid warfare in which a cyber attack preceded a conventional military strike. Despite the Russian government's denial of involvement in the cyber attack, the planning, servers of Russian state-owned businesses, and timing of the attack suggest some degree of coordination or direction by the Russian government.⁴¹ The cyber attack began with a series of small-scale DDOS attacks in June 2008, two months prior to the five-day war over the breakaway region of South Ossetia.⁴² The cyber attacks made use of botnets, which loaded computers with malicious software. The hackers then ordered the zombie computers to send millions of requests to designated websites to overwhelm the server causing it to shut down. On July 20, several DDOS attacks on President Mikhail Saakashvili's official website caused it to shut down for over 24 hours.⁴³ Reports indicated that the cyber attack came from a\"command-and-control server\"set up several weeks earlier in the United States, which shows that planning and coordination are not confined to national borders.⁴⁴ The U.S.-based server became operational many weeks ahead of the actual attacks, and by August 8, the first day of the war, the rate of cyber attacks had escalated to a very high level. Six botnets launched a coordinated cyber attack on Georgian government and media websites.⁴⁵ The cyber attacks also increased in intensity along with the physical conflict between Russian and Georgian troops. The websites of the President, Parliament, Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the National Bank of Georgia, and the online news agencies of The Messenger and Civil.ge all shut down. The websites of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the LBJ JOURNAL OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS National Bank were defaced by adding images comparing Saakashvili with Adolf Hitler.46 Although defacing a government website has a visual impact, shutting down online media sources during a military attack is characteristic of information warfare with the intent to disrupt communication and prevent dissemination of accurate information.\nThe Georgian government reacted by requesting permission from Google to transfer the websites of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Civil.ge to the Blogspot domain, which were better protected from the DDOS attacks.47 Atlanta-based Tulip Systems, Inc. agreed to host the President's website. Polish President Lech Kacyznski provided space on his website for official Georgian press releases, and Estonia hosted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and sent two information security specialists to support Georgian cyber defenses.48 Reports indicated that StopGeorgia.ru, which was established within hours of Russian forces entering South Ossetia, was a main coordinator of the cyber attacks.49 The forum provided a continuously updated list of target websites. It also encouraged visitors to download DoSHTTP, a free software program, to allow them to participate in the DDOS attacks.50 Project Grey Goose, an independent project launched by cyber specialist Jeff Carr and 100 computer security, technology, and intelligence volunteers, attempted to determine the source of the cyber attacks. Although, the group was unable to verify Russian-sponsorship of StopGeorgia.ru and another website, Xakep.ru, it is still reasonable to conclude a link exists. Russian government members clearly supported the sites' efforts and their implied consent by refusing to take action against the sites to stop the cyber attacks.51 Project Grey Goose also found that the hackers made extensive use of SQL attacks, which are simpler than DDOS attacks. The SQL attacks exploit vulnerabilities within MySQL, a popular open source software which websites commonly use to manage databases. The targeted database is overwhelmed with millions of extraneous queries, shutting down the server. The benefit of using a combined SQL and DDOS attack is that it is very difficult to detect.52 SQL attacks also do not require as many computers to have the same impact as a DDOS attack that cannot be kept up without botnets. The methods used showed “planning, organization, targeted reconnaissance, and evolution of attacks.”53 The cyber attacks on Georgia in 2008 did not cause nearly the damage that they did in Estonia in 2007 because Georgia's economy and infrastructure are not fully integrated to the Internet—only 7 percent of the country has access to the Internet, with only limited coverage outside Tiblisi.54 Nevertheless, the attacks disrupted timely dissemination of information by the Georgian government and forced it to seek alternative methods for distributing information to the international community.\n### China and Cyber Attacks China is a main threat to cyber security because of the large number of Internet users and because of the high number of attacks originating in the country that are more sophisticated than other actors.55 China also regards cyber warfare as CYBER WARFARE SPRING 2012 a central component in future conflicts, such as with the United States, where a direct confrontation would be difficult.56 This is an example of asymmetric warfare, where one actor, a country or non-state entity, undermines another country's strength by exploiting its weaknesses.57 Asymmetric conflict involves a tactical operation whose objective is to prevent the opponent from engaging in battle. This vision makes sense from China's perspective because it must counter the United States' technological advantage. Cyber attacks from China are not new. China launched cyber attacks in response to U.S. planes bombing the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, and following the crash of a Chinese fighter after it collided with a U.S. surveillance plane. In 2002, U.S. government servers were the target of coordinated cyber attacks, code-named Titan Rain, which originated in China.58 Targeted locations included the U.S. Army Information Systems Engineering Command, the Naval Ocean Systems Center, the Missile Defense Agency, and Sandia National Laboratories. China downloaded between 10 and 20 terabytes of data, or roughly the amount of information contained in the entire Library of Congress. The cyber attacks sought to gain information about military and government activities. China also conducted reconnaissance of the U.S. command and control system, information that it could use in future cyber attacks.59 In addition to the United States, China has targeted other Western nations. The German Vice President of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution, Hans Elmar Remberg, accused China of carrying out computer network intrusions on an\"almost daily\"basis.60 French Secretary-General of National Defense Francis Delon confirmed that the Chinese had targeted many French government websites in September 2007.61 In November 2007, MI-5 Director Jonathan Evans warned financial service companies that they were the targets of\"state-sponsored computer network exploitation.\"62 In the cyber attacks on the British financial system, the Chinese hackers were suspected of successfully obtaining strategic plans and risk management systems of Lehman brothers, Britain's Bradford &amp; Bingley, and Iceland's Landsbanki.63 Chinese hackers associated with the People's Liberation Army (PLA) carried out an attack on Pentagon computer networks that lasted for several weeks in 2007.64 The cyber attacks overpowered the defenses mounted by U.S. military computer experts. The cyber attacks overpowered the defenses mounted by U.S. military computer experts. The Chinese hackers gained accessed to the unclassified computer system that supports the Secretary of Defense. To avoid further damage, the Pentagon shut down the network.65 The cyber attack resulted in the creation of the National Cyber Investigative Joint Task Force to\"coordinate, integrate, and share information related to all domestic cyber threat investigations.\"66 By 2005, the Chinese PLA had formed\"information warfare militia units\"charged with developing viruses to attack enemy computer systems and networks.67 There are thought to be about 250 hacker groups in China that are either tolerated or encouraged by the government.68 One such group was the Network Crack Program Hacker (NCPH) that had ties to the PLA. NCPH developed software that allowed remote control of network programs, enabling the organization to steal government documents. NCPH also took advantage of holes in Microsoft Of LBJ JOURNAL OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS VOL. 20 CYBER WARFARE China is interested in aggressively acquiring commercial secrets and information on future weapons systems.⁷¹ The closed and authoritarian nature of the Chinese state and its tight regulation of the Internet make it tough to imagine large hacker communities operating freely without state supervision. The lack of transparency regarding Chinese military modernization and yearly increases in military expenditures is a main concern for the Pentagon. Chinese use of cyber warfare is becoming increasingly sophisticated. Although, the Chinese space program is focused mostly on civilian uses, it is providing the PLA with the ability to track U.S. forces in the western Pacific Ocean. China's advances in cyber technology will jeopardize the U.S. military communication systems that depend on wireless communications and computer networks.⁷² In addition, China is targeting defense contractors, such as Raytheon, Lockheed Martin, Boeing, and Northrop Grumman, all of which have had their unclassified networks penetrated by Chinese hackers. In 2005, Chinese hackers were able to obtain the Army's and Air Force's flight planning software from Redstone Arsenal, Alabama.⁷³ Furthermore, Chinese operations have been detected inside certain U.S. electricity grids. The Chinese have the capability to map electric networks and leave behind malicious software to sabotage networks later. Former DNI McConnell stated he would be surprised if tools and capabilities have not been left in computer and information systems that could be put into action at some time in the future.⁷⁴ Current waves of cyber attacks from China are aimed mainly at collecting information and probing defenses. China is likely to continue to exploit U.S. dependence on cyberspace because of low operations costs compared to traditional espionage methods or military activities. Cyber attacks create confusion, and there is no legal framework for cyber warfare.⁷⁵ An international legal framework provides a basis for deterring cyber attacks by creating a cost and international pressure for violating an accepted norm.⁷⁶ ## A CYBER ARMS RACE The cyber attacks being detected today and the use of hybrid warfare in the Russia-Georgia War are the beginning of a new international race to develop cyber weapons and the defenses to protect against them. As the Internet spreads to ever more distant parts of the world, and national economies become increasingly LBJ JOURNAL OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS CYBER WARFARE SPRING 2012 integrated into the World Wide Web, the desire to acquire both offensive and defensive cyber capabilities by states and non-state actors will multiply. China is an advanced technology products exporting power and a leader in the semiconductor industry, which gives it unique access to technology components.77 This access also provides a potential opening for launching cyber attacks.78 If an imminent attack was detected, some officials argue that the United States should pre-emptively strike the source, ranging from an online attack to a physical strike, as a means to deter future cyber attacks.79 Other officials argue that pre-emptive attacks would provide justification for foreign governments to invest in their own efforts to engage in cyber warfare and to pre-emptively attack the United States.80 With the numbers of hackers and the superior computing ability that comes from harnessing tens of thousands of computers around the world in botnets, someone will find a way to breach a network security system. In the long run, it is not possible to simply build more advanced cyber defenses. The best defense against a cyber attack is to develop a robust capability to engage in cyber war and develop the necessary defenses to mitigate a cyber attack.\nThe benefit of Eligible Receiver in the early days of cyber attacks is that federal agencies, research groups, and military contractors now frequently run war games to assess U.S. vulnerabilities. Although President Obama has not spoken openly about whether he supports or opposes cyber weapons, it would be irresponsible not to develop them to protect against attacks. These capabilities are also critical because they can provide vital intelligence, and foreign intelligence services are already using such capabilities, or investing heavily in developing them. U.S. intelligence agencies could activate code embedded in computer chips during the manufacturing process that would enable the U.S. to remotely control an enemy's computers over the Internet. However, the U.S. potentially runs the same risk from computer chips made in China.\nCurrently, there is no broad authorization for American forces to engage in cyber war. Former President Bush attempted to include a section to improve U.S. cyber defenses in a classified set of presidential orders in January 2008, but the administration failed to agree on how to write the authorization.81 Instead, President Bush authorized individual uses of cyber warfare in Iraq and Iran.82 In 2003, the Pentagon and U.S. intelligence agencies made plans for a cyber attack on Saddam Hussein's bank accounts. The plan would have frozen billions of dollars and crippled the Iraqi government's financial system in advance of the U.S. invasion of Iraq. Saddam Hussein would have had no money for war supplies or money to pay troops.83 Bush administration officials were concerned that the plan might not be limited to Iraq, potentially causing global financial disorder, spreading throughout the Middle East to Europe, and to the United States. Therefore, the plan was never carried out. However, President Bush did approve a plan to disable Iraq's military and government communications.84 The U.S. government contacted international communications companies that provided satellite and cell phone coverage in Iraq to warn them about jamming and to request support by turning off their signals. The communications jamming did affect surrounding countries that shared communication systems with Iraq, but the damage was considered LBJ JOURNAL OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS VOL. 20 CYBER WARFARE\n\n## DISCUSSION\nPresident Obama expanded a $17 billion, five-year program, known as the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative, authorized by President Bush in 2008.⁸⁶ In December 2009, President Obama appointed Howard Schmidt to fill the White House cyber security coordinator, after Melissa Hathaway resigned in August 2009, citing delays in the appointment process.⁸⁷ Secretary Robert Gates approved the creation of the U.S. Cyber Command (USCYBERCOMM) headed by the director of the National Security Agency, to be the nation's central hub for cyber capabilities. USCYBERCOMM incorporates the Joint Task Force-Global Network Operations (JTF-GNO) and the Joint Functional Component Command-Network Warfare (JFCC-NW). The organization will build the defenses for military computers and communications systems as well as developing and deploying cyber weapons.⁸⁸ The Pentagon has already commissioned military contractors to develop a classified version of the future Internet, known as the National Cyber Range, on which to test simulated cyber attacks to improve U.S. defenses.⁸⁹\nIt is clear the rapid dissemination of information and technology will only magnify the threat of cyber warfare in years to come. The Russian-based attacks on Estonia and Georgia showed how cyber attacks defy state borders and raise difficult issues of jurisdiction. It also shows Russia's preference of using cyber attacks to settle scores with former Soviet states. In addition, China is exhibiting a keen interest in industrial espionage and aggressive intelligence gathering through cyber attacks against Western governments. In April 2011, President Obama announced the National Strategy for Trusted Identities in Cyberspace as a means to increase trustworthiness of identities in online transactions in response to fraud and identity thefts.⁹⁰ The U.S. will have to spearhead the formation of a legal framework for this new challenge, complete with definition of vital terms and rules of the game. The main tenets of warfare embedded in the UN Geneva Conventions will have to be revised to incorporate cyber warfare because it blurs the principles of proportionality, neutrality, and distinction. Yet the most serious problem of cyber warfare is that countries do not know how good the weapons are until they are used.\n## ENDNOTES\n\nLBJ JOURNAL OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS CYBER WARFARE SPRING 2012\n\nLBJ JOURNAL OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS VOL. 20 CYBER WARFARE\n\nLBJ JOURNAL OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS CYBER WARFARE SPRING 2012\n\nLBJ JOURNAL OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS VOL. 20 CYBER WARFARE\n\nLBJ JOURNAL OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS CYBER WARFARE SPRING 2012\n\nLBJ JOURNAL OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS VOL. 20 CYBER WARFARE 39",

While cyberspace is often viewed as a virtual world, it is composed of vulnerable physical infrastructure. The vast amount of digital infrastructure that supports the Internet, the economy, the government, and the military makes it nearly impossible to guarantee total security. The more dependent a country becomes on the Internet and the more interconnected its systems become, the more vulnerable the country is to hackers or foreign intelligence services conducting espionage. The National Intelligence Council stated in its most recent quadrennial report, Global Trends 2025: A Transformed World, that the increasing use of cyber warfare is one of the primary factors that\"will constrict U.S. freedom of action.\"It is particularly difficult for the U.S. government to respond to cyber attacks because it is very difficult to track the source of an attack and to determine who initiated it. The international race to build cyber defenses and to develop offensive capabilities, as well as the lack of law governing cyberspace, makes cyber warfare one of the most urgent national security problems facing the United States.\n# CYBERSPACE IS A REAL AND GROWING THREAT Cyberspace is wrongly viewed as something that cannot be seen, only existing in a virtual form. Cyberspace is real and has very physical components. It exists in the computer systems that enable Wall Street to function and it forms the backbone of all major companies. Cyberspace also exists in the critical infrastructure that allows computers to communicate with each other, such as the main communication trunk line from Europe to the United States that comes up on the New Jersey shore. It plays a major role in the functioning of software, computers, and LBJ JOURNAL OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS CYBER WARFARE SPRING 2012 cell phones, all of which are now common in daily life. Cyberspace includes the broadband networks, wireless signals, and local area networks in schools. It also encompasses the critical military and intelligence networks designed to protect the United States. While the Internet has made society more interconnected than at any time in history, it has also made it easier for domestic and foreign hackers to disrupt daily life.\nCyber attack refers to a deliberate action to\"alter, disrupt, deceive, degrade, or destroy\"networks, computer systems, or programs that may be contained on a computer or moving through a system.² A cyber attack generally involves penetrating a computer network as a means to disrupt an opponent's critical services, such as accessing a utility control system. Groups that operate independently or with state sponsorship that can gain access to intellectual property or classified military information are a growing threat. However, there are legitimate uses of cyber attacks. The United States prepares to conduct cyber attacks in conjunction with other information warfare methods and with conventional attacks to protect national security. Domestic law enforcement also engages in cyber attacks when jamming devices are used to prevent cell phone calls when suspected to be used to detonate a bomb.\nCyber attacks became much more common during the late 1990s, including such cases as the 1998 Internet Worm, Melissa Virus, I-LOVE-YOU virus, Code Red Virus, and the Nimda Virus. Initially, attacks consisted of malware, such as viruses and worms. Today, cyber attacks are increasingly sophisticated and adaptive. Security breaches and information theft are commonplace in the news. Foreign intelligence services from countries such as China, Israel, Iran, Russia, and the United States have used cyber capabilities defensively and offensively.\nThe first major test of the U.S. government's cyber infrastructure from cyber attacks was Eligible Receiver in June 1997, a Joint Staff test exercise run by the Department of Defense (DOD).³ The unannounced exercise targeted 20 different agencies and revealed significant vulnerabilities within the U.S. government's information infrastructures. A team of 35 computer experts from the National Security Agency split into four teams to simulate hackers trying to penetrate U.S. computer networks. The teams used publicly available information and tools found on the Internet and commercial Internet accounts to exploit actual vulnerabilities. Over the next two weeks they successfully hacked into power grids of nine U.S. cities and cracked their 911 emergency systems. They also attacked the Pentagon's computer networks, gaining access to 36 of them. Only two of the attacks were detected. Once inside the systems, the teams had complete access and were able to issue fake orders and news reports about the crisis. As a result, no one in the entire chain of command could be certain of what was accurate. If it had been a real attack, the four teams would have been able to prevent the United States from responding effectively.⁴ The severity of security challenges posed by cyber warfare to any country is highly related to the degree of its dependence on modern information and communications technology. Countries with advanced internet accessibility, including widespread online commerce and banking, possess far more vulnerabilities to at- LBJ JOURNAL OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS VOL. 20 CYBER WARFARE Every day there are thousands of cyber attacks on federal and private computer systems. The DOD estimated that in 2007 there were 43,880 incidents of malicious activity from all sources on five million computers, a 31 percent increase from 2006.¹¹ Some attacks are malicious, but others appear to be testing the chinks in the patchwork of firewalls. The most dangerous aspect is the attacks that go undetected by common security tools. The number of attacks is increasing and they are becoming increasingly bold. In January 2008, a Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) official stated that the CIA knew hackers had disrupted or threatened to disrupt power in four foreign cities.¹² The enormous challenge of defending cyber infrastructure ranges from forensic tasks to determine attack attribution to the broader concern of proportionality of a response and what is considered a legitimate target.\nA CSIS panel researched potential vulnerabilities and determined that the main threat is not the capabilities of individual hackers but the capabilities of other nations, such as China and Russia. Team Cymru, a research company, reviewed Internet scans that attempted to enter industrial control systems. Scans originated from 14 different countries, including China, Iran, Israel, Russia, Taiwan, and even the United States. The Team Cymru results showed that 90 percent of the scans originated in China.¹³ LBJ JOURNAL OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS CYBER WARFARE SPRING 2012 Although scanning alone does not cause any damage to computer systems, it could be a preliminary step in an actual attack that would scramble databases or control computers. Former Director of National Intelligence (DNI) Mike McConnell told President Bush in 2007 that if a large U.S. bank were successfully hacked,\"it would have an order-of-magnitude greater impact on the global economy\"than the September 11, 2001, attacks. McConnell warned,\"the ability to threaten the U.S. money supply is the equivalent of today's nuclear weapon.\"14 A cyber attack on the banking system could shut down the system that clears all financial transactions, thus undermining all confidence in the monetary system.\nIn a cyber war, it is difficult to determine the source of an attack or the attacker's identity. The ability to backtrack a cyber attack to the source depends on a rapid response capability on the order of seconds, minutes, or hours. The pathways used by hackers may only be active for milliseconds and often there is no identifying evidence that remains once the hacker has completed his objective. In the case of the Team Cymru study, the team could not identify whether military organizations, intelligence agencies, terrorists, criminals, or inventive individuals were the source of the cyber attacks.[15] Even if the physical origin of an attack can be identified, there is no guarantee that the hacker behind the attack is sponsored by that country or that the hacker is even located within the given country.[16] A new type of cyber warfare that is growing is hybrid warfare.[17] National governments rather than individual hackers carry out this type of attack. Hybrid warfare is a cyber attack that is timed to coincide with a conventional military offensive. A cyber attack using mass communication sources in conjunction with a conventional military attack may also be used to influence global public opinion.[18] Hybrid warfare is particularly threatening because it is designed to prevent an effective response by the targeted country to a physical attack.\nAn offensive tool in the cyber arsenal is the botnet, a collection of computers that have been compromised by malicious software. The program commandeers the infected machines, creating a vast network. The compromised computers, known as\"zombies,\"can be remotely controlled, often without the knowledge of anyone using the zombie computer. The zombie network can be instructed to attack a designated target by overwhelming it with thousands of commands.[19] In an actual cyber war, a successful cyber attack would target computer-dependent infrastructure, such as a nation's power grid or banking system. Also, an attack on a nation's air traffic control system could blind the air traffic controllers' air defense networks, hindering an effective counterstrike.[20] # USE OF CYBER WARFARE BY FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE SERVICES ## CYBER ATTACK ON ESTONIA In 2007, Estonia was subject to a prolonged cyber attack suspected of being sponsored by Russia. Estonia, a developed former Soviet Republic, has a high level of access to advanced communications technology. The Estonian government shifted all of its major government operations to the Internet in 2005. The government LBJ JOURNAL OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS holds all cabinet meetings online and documents are signed with e-signatures. Beginning in March 2007, Estonians can even vote online.21 Over 60 percent of the population has online access to bank accounts and 95 percent of banking transactions are online.22 Russian hackers were patiently waiting for a pretext to test Estonia's cyber defenses.\nIn April 2007, the Estonian government decided to relocate a monument that commemorated the Soviet armed forces' contribution to liberating Estonia from Nazi control during World War II. Moving the monument from the center of Tallinn, the capital, to a military cemetery outside the city sparked protests and riots among the Russian minority. The event may have provided the pretext, and the unrest was closely followed by distributed denial of service (DDOS) attacks originating in Russia.23 A call to action and step-by-step instructions about how to carry out DDOS attacks spread through Russian chat rooms. The Estonian government websites that normally received 1,000 visitors per day suddenly started receiving 2,000 visits per second.24 Anyone who attempted to access the target sites had their computer screens frozen.25 The websites of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Justice shut down, and the Prime Minister Andrus Ansip's Reform Party website was defaced by the addition of an image of Prime Minister Ansip with an Adolf Hitler mustache. The Russian hackers also briefly disabled the national emergency phone number.26 The United States and NATO sent computer security teams to aid the Estonian authorities to cope with the DDOS waves that overpowered the country's government websites, banking industry, and media organizations. The clandestine groups of hackers were not confirmed to be operating with Russian sponsorship, but evidence suggests the Russian authorities were at least complicit.27 The unusual aspect of the attacks was that they lasted for several weeks and had a very high intensity. Some of the botnets used in the DDOS attacks included up to 100,000 zombie computers. The commandeered computers directed large amounts of data at Estonia's government websites and banking system.28 The US-NATO efforts stabilized the situation, but intermittent attacks continued until mid-May 2007.29 In response to the cyber attacks, NATO established the Cooperative Defense Center in Estonia in May 2008. The center is staffed by 30 cyber specialists and is part of NATO's network of Centers of Excellence accredited to train representatives from member states about technical aspects of NATO operations.30 However, the new center's vulnerability was shown with the capture of Herman Simm in September 2008, which also further implicated Russia in the cyber attack on Estonia.31 Herman Simm, 61, was a high ranking official working in the Estonian Ministry of Defense. In 2001, he was appointed head of the State Secret Protection Office. He also developed the information protection systems for NATO and the European Union, frequently leading Estonian talks on protecting classified data. He was described as being “at the cutting edge of NATO's most important new strategic missions: to defend the alliance against cyber-attack.”32 Recruited as an asset by Russia in the late 1980s, he was accused of providing classified U.S. missile shield and cyber defense information to the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service for millions of dollars. The Estonian government issued Simm CYBER WARFARE SPRING 2012 a diplomatic passport that he used to personally transfer documents abroad.³³ Although it is unknown if he had other accomplices within the government, Simm oversaw the issuance of security clearances for Estonian intelligence, military, and security agencies.³⁴ An Estonian court convicted Simm of treason in February 2009. He was ordered to pay $1.6 million and sentenced to 12 years in prison for damage to security systems.³⁵ In November 2008, the United States DOD computers were subject to a retaliatory cyber attack thought to originate in Russia.³⁶ The attack spread throughout the computer network via agent.btz malware, which was designed specifically to target military computers.

The methods used showed “planning, organization, targeted reconnaissance, and evolution of attacks.”53 The cyber attacks on Georgia in 2008 did not cause nearly the damage that they did in Estonia in 2007 because Georgia's economy and infrastructure are not fully integrated to the Internet—only 7 percent of the country has access to the Internet, with only limited coverage outside Tiblisi.54 Nevertheless, the attacks disrupted timely dissemination of information by the Georgian government and forced it to seek alternative methods for distributing information to the international community.\n### China and Cyber Attacks China is a main threat to cyber security because of the large number of Internet users and because of the high number of attacks originating in the country that are more sophisticated than other actors.55 China also regards cyber warfare as CYBER WARFARE SPRING 2012 a central component in future conflicts, such as with the United States, where a direct confrontation would be difficult.56 This is an example of asymmetric warfare, where one actor, a country or non-state entity, undermines another country's strength by exploiting its weaknesses.57 Asymmetric conflict involves a tactical operation whose objective is to prevent the opponent from engaging in battle. This vision makes sense from China's perspective because it must counter the United States' technological advantage. Cyber attacks from China are not new. China launched cyber attacks in response to U.S. planes bombing the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, and following the crash of a Chinese fighter after it collided with a U.S. surveillance plane. In 2002, U.S. government servers were the target of coordinated cyber attacks, code-named Titan Rain, which originated in China.58 Targeted locations included the U.S. Army Information Systems Engineering Command, the Naval Ocean Systems Center, the Missile Defense Agency, and Sandia National Laboratories. China downloaded between 10 and 20 terabytes of data, or roughly the amount of information contained in the entire Library of Congress. The cyber attacks sought to gain information about military and government activities. China also conducted reconnaissance of the U.S. command and control system, information that it could use in future cyber attacks.59 In addition to the United States, China has targeted other Western nations. The German Vice President of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution, Hans Elmar Remberg, accused China of carrying out computer network intrusions on an\"almost daily\"basis.60 French Secretary-General of National Defense Francis Delon confirmed that the Chinese had targeted many French government websites in September 2007.61 In November 2007, MI-5 Director Jonathan Evans warned financial service companies that they were the targets of\"state-sponsored computer network exploitation.\"62 In the cyber attacks on the British financial system, the Chinese hackers were suspected of successfully obtaining strategic plans and risk management systems of Lehman brothers, Britain's Bradford &amp; Bingley, and Iceland's Landsbanki.63 Chinese hackers associated with the People's Liberation Army (PLA) carried out an attack on Pentagon computer networks that lasted for several weeks in 2007.64 The cyber attacks overpowered the defenses mounted by U.S. military computer experts. The cyber attacks overpowered the defenses mounted by U.S. military computer experts. The Chinese hackers gained accessed to the unclassified computer system that supports the Secretary of Defense. To avoid further damage, the Pentagon shut down the network.65 The cyber attack resulted in the creation of the National Cyber Investigative Joint Task Force to\"coordinate, integrate, and share information related to all domestic cyber threat investigations.\"66 By 2005, the Chinese PLA had formed\"information warfare militia units\"charged with developing viruses to attack enemy computer systems and networks.67 There are thought to be about 250 hacker groups in China that are either tolerated or encouraged by the government.68 One such group was the Network Crack Program Hacker (NCPH) that had ties to the PLA. NCPH developed software that allowed remote control of network programs, enabling the organization to steal government documents. NCPH also took advantage of holes in Microsoft Of LBJ JOURNAL OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS VOL. 20 CYBER WARFARE China is interested in aggressively acquiring commercial secrets and information on future weapons systems.⁷¹ The closed and authoritarian nature of the Chinese state and its tight regulation of the Internet make it tough to imagine large hacker communities operating freely without state supervision. The lack of transparency regarding Chinese military modernization and yearly increases in military expenditures is a main concern for the Pentagon. Chinese use of cyber warfare is becoming increasingly sophisticated. Although, the Chinese space program is focused mostly on civilian uses, it is providing the PLA with the ability to track U.S. forces in the western Pacific Ocean. China's advances in cyber technology will jeopardize the U.S. military communication systems that depend on wireless communications and computer networks.⁷² In addition, China is targeting defense contractors, such as Raytheon, Lockheed Martin, Boeing, and Northrop Grumman, all of which have had their unclassified networks penetrated by Chinese hackers. In 2005, Chinese hackers were able to obtain the Army's and Air Force's flight planning software from Redstone Arsenal, Alabama.⁷³ Furthermore, Chinese operations have been detected inside certain U.S. electricity grids. The Chinese have the capability to map electric networks and leave behind malicious software to sabotage networks later. Former DNI McConnell stated he would be surprised if tools and capabilities have not been left in computer and information systems that could be put into action at some time in the future.⁷⁴ Current waves of cyber attacks from China are aimed mainly at collecting information and probing defenses. China is likely to continue to exploit U.S. dependence on cyberspace because of low operations costs compared to traditional espionage methods or military activities. Cyber attacks create confusion, and there is no legal framework for cyber warfare.⁷⁵ An international legal framework provides a basis for deterring cyber attacks by creating a cost and international pressure for violating an accepted norm.⁷⁶ ## A CYBER ARMS RACE The cyber attacks being detected today and the use of hybrid warfare in the Russia-Georgia War are the beginning of a new international race to develop cyber weapons and the defenses to protect against them. As the Internet spreads to ever more distant parts of the world, and national economies become increasingly LBJ JOURNAL OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS CYBER WARFARE SPRING 2012 integrated into the World Wide Web, the desire to acquire both offensive and defensive cyber capabilities by states and non-state actors will multiply. China is an advanced technology products exporting power and a leader in the semiconductor industry, which gives it unique access to technology components.77 This access also provides a potential opening for launching cyber attacks.78 If an imminent attack was detected, some officials argue that the United States should pre-emptively strike the source, ranging from an online attack to a physical strike, as a means to deter future cyber attacks.79 Other officials argue that pre-emptive attacks would provide justification for foreign governments to invest in their own efforts to engage in cyber warfare and to pre-emptively attack the United States.80 With the numbers of hackers and the superior computing ability that comes from harnessing tens of thousands of computers around the world in botnets, someone will find a way to breach a network security system. In the long run, it is not possible to simply build more advanced cyber defenses. The best defense against a cyber attack is to develop a robust capability to engage in cyber war and develop the necessary defenses to mitigate a cyber attack.\nThe benefit of Eligible Receiver in the early days of cyber attacks is that federal agencies, research groups, and military contractors now frequently run war games to assess U.S. vulnerabilities. Although President Obama has not spoken openly about whether he supports or opposes cyber weapons, it would be irresponsible not to develop them to protect against attacks. These capabilities are also critical because they can provide vital intelligence, and foreign intelligence services are already using such capabilities, or investing heavily in developing them. U.S. intelligence agencies could activate code embedded in computer chips during the manufacturing process that would enable the U.S. to remotely control an enemy's computers over the Internet. However, the U.S. potentially runs the same risk from computer chips made in China.\nCurrently, there is no broad authorization for American forces to engage in cyber war. Former President Bush attempted to include a section to improve U.S. cyber defenses in a classified set of presidential orders in January 2008, but the administration failed to agree on how to write the authorization.81 Instead, President Bush authorized individual uses of cyber warfare in Iraq and Iran.82 In 2003, the Pentagon and U.S. intelligence agencies made plans for a cyber attack on Saddam Hussein's bank accounts. The plan would have frozen billions of dollars and crippled the Iraqi government's financial system in advance of the U.S. invasion of Iraq. Saddam Hussein would have had no money for war supplies or money to pay troops.83 Bush administration officials were concerned that the plan might not be limited to Iraq, potentially causing global financial disorder, spreading throughout the Middle East to Europe, and to the United States. Therefore, the plan was never carried out. However, President Bush did approve a plan to disable Iraq's military and government communications.84 The U.S. government contacted international communications companies that provided satellite and cell phone coverage in Iraq to warn them about jamming and to request support by turning off their signals. The communications jamming did affect surrounding countries that shared communication systems with Iraq, but the damage was considered LBJ JOURNAL OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS VOL. 20 CYBER WARFARE\n\n## DISCUSSION\nPresident Obama expanded a $17 billion, five-year program, known as the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative, authorized by President Bush in 2008.⁸⁶ In December 2009, President Obama appointed Howard Schmidt to fill the White House cyber security coordinator, after Melissa Hathaway resigned in August 2009, citing delays in the appointment process.⁸⁷ Secretary Robert Gates approved the creation of the U.S. Cyber Command (USCYBERCOMM) headed by the director of the National Security Agency, to be the nation's central hub for cyber capabilities. USCYBERCOMM incorporates the Joint Task Force-Global Network Operations (JTF-GNO) and the Joint Functional Component Command-Network Warfare (JFCC-NW). The organization will build the defenses for military computers and communications systems as well as developing and deploying cyber weapons.⁸⁸ The Pentagon has already commissioned military contractors to develop a classified version of the future Internet, known as the National Cyber Range, on which to test simulated cyber attacks to improve U.S. defenses.⁸⁹\nIt is clear the rapid dissemination of information and technology will only magnify the threat of cyber warfare in years to come. The Russian-based attacks on Estonia and Georgia showed how cyber attacks defy state borders and raise difficult issues of jurisdiction. It also shows Russia's preference of using cyber attacks to settle scores with former Soviet states. In addition, China is exhibiting a keen interest in industrial espionage and aggressive intelligence gathering through cyber attacks against Western governments. In April 2011, President Obama announced the National Strategy for Trusted Identities in Cyberspace as a means to increase trustworthiness of identities in online transactions in response to fraud and identity thefts.⁹⁰ The U.S. will have to spearhead the formation of a legal framework for this new challenge, complete with definition of vital terms and rules of the game. The main tenets of warfare embedded in the UN Geneva Conventions will have to be revised to incorporate cyber warfare because it blurs the principles of proportionality, neutrality, and distinction. Yet the most serious problem of cyber warfare is that countries do not know how good the weapons are until they are used.\n## ENDNOTES\n\nLBJ JOURNAL OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS CYBER WARFARE SPRING 2012\n\nLBJ JOURNAL OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS VOL. 20 CYBER WARFARE\n\nLBJ JOURNAL OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS CYBER WARFARE SPRING 2012\n\nLBJ JOURNAL OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS VOL. 20 CYBER WARFARE\n\nLBJ JOURNAL OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS CYBER WARFARE SPRING 2012\n\nLBJ JOURNAL OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS VOL. 20 CYBER WARFARE 39",

While cyberspace is often viewed as a virtual world, it is composed of vulnerable physical infrastructure. The vast amount of digital infrastructure that supports the Internet, the economy, the government, and the military makes it nearly impossible to guarantee total security. The more dependent a country becomes on the Internet and the more interconnected its systems become, the more vulnerable the country is to hackers or foreign intelligence services conducting espionage. The National Intelligence Council stated in its most recent quadrennial report, Global Trends 2025: A Transformed World, that the increasing use of cyber warfare is one of the primary factors that\"will constrict U.S. freedom of action.\"It is particularly difficult for the U.S. government to respond to cyber attacks because it is very difficult to track the source of an attack and to determine who initiated it. The international race to build cyber defenses and to develop offensive capabilities, as well as the lack of law governing cyberspace, makes cyber warfare one of the most urgent national security problems facing the United States.\n# CYBERSPACE IS A REAL AND GROWING THREAT Cyberspace is wrongly viewed as something that cannot be seen, only existing in a virtual form. Cyberspace is real and has very physical components. It exists in the computer systems that enable Wall Street to function and it forms the backbone of all major companies. Cyberspace also exists in the critical infrastructure that allows computers to communicate with each other, such as the main communication trunk line from Europe to the United States that comes up on the New Jersey shore. It plays a major role in the functioning of software, computers, and LBJ JOURNAL OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS CYBER WARFARE SPRING 2012 cell phones, all of which are now common in daily life. Cyberspace includes the broadband networks, wireless signals, and local area networks in schools. It also encompasses the critical military and intelligence networks designed to protect the United States. While the Internet has made society more interconnected than at any time in history, it has also made it easier for domestic and foreign hackers to disrupt daily life.\nCyber attack refers to a deliberate action to\"alter, disrupt, deceive, degrade, or destroy\"networks, computer systems, or programs that may be contained on a computer or moving through a system.² A cyber attack generally involves penetrating a computer network as a means to disrupt an opponent's critical services, such as accessing a utility control system. Groups that operate independently or with state sponsorship that can gain access to intellectual property or classified military information are a growing threat. However, there are legitimate uses of cyber attacks. The United States prepares to conduct cyber attacks in conjunction with other information warfare methods and with conventional attacks to protect national security. Domestic law enforcement also engages in cyber attacks when jamming devices are used to prevent cell phone calls when suspected to be used to detonate a bomb.\nCyber attacks became much more common during the late 1990s, including such cases as the 1998 Internet Worm, Melissa Virus, I-LOVE-YOU virus, Code Red Virus, and the Nimda Virus. Initially, attacks consisted of malware, such as viruses and worms. Today, cyber attacks are increasingly sophisticated and adaptive. Security breaches and information theft are commonplace in the news. Foreign intelligence services from countries such as China, Israel, Iran, Russia, and the United States have used cyber capabilities defensively and offensively.\nThe first major test of the U.S. government's cyber infrastructure from cyber attacks was Eligible Receiver in June 1997, a Joint Staff test exercise run by the Department of Defense (DOD).³ The unannounced exercise targeted 20 different agencies and revealed significant vulnerabilities within the U.S. government's information infrastructures. A team of 35 computer experts from the National Security Agency split into four teams to simulate hackers trying to penetrate U.S. computer networks. The teams used publicly available information and tools found on the Internet and commercial Internet accounts to exploit actual vulnerabilities. Over the next two weeks they successfully hacked into power grids of nine U.S. cities and cracked their 911 emergency systems. They also attacked the Pentagon's computer networks, gaining access to 36 of them. Only two of the attacks were detected. Once inside the systems, the teams had complete access and were able to issue fake orders and news reports about the crisis. As a result, no one in the entire chain of command could be certain of what was accurate. If it had been a real attack, the four teams would have been able to prevent the United States from responding effectively.⁴ The severity of security challenges posed by cyber warfare to any country is highly related to the degree of its dependence on modern information and communications technology. Countries with advanced internet accessibility, including widespread online commerce and banking, possess far more vulnerabilities to at- LBJ JOURNAL OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS VOL. 20 CYBER WARFARE Every day there are thousands of cyber attacks on federal and private computer systems. The DOD estimated that in 2007 there were 43,880 incidents of malicious activity from all sources on five million computers, a 31 percent increase from 2006.¹¹ Some attacks are malicious, but others appear to be testing the chinks in the patchwork of firewalls. The most dangerous aspect is the attacks that go undetected by common security tools. The number of attacks is increasing and they are becoming increasingly bold. In January 2008, a Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) official stated that the CIA knew hackers had disrupted or threatened to disrupt power in four foreign cities.¹² The enormous challenge of defending cyber infrastructure ranges from forensic tasks to determine attack attribution to the broader concern of proportionality of a response and what is considered a legitimate target.\nA CSIS panel researched potential vulnerabilities and determined that the main threat is not the capabilities of individual hackers but the capabilities of other nations, such as China and Russia. Team Cymru, a research company, reviewed Internet scans that attempted to enter industrial control systems. Scans originated from 14 different countries, including China, Iran, Israel, Russia, Taiwan, and even the United States. The Team Cymru results showed that 90 percent of the scans originated in China.¹³ LBJ JOURNAL OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS CYBER WARFARE SPRING 2012 Although scanning alone does not cause any damage to computer systems, it could be a preliminary step in an actual attack that would scramble databases or control computers. Former Director of National Intelligence (DNI) Mike McConnell told President Bush in 2007 that if a large U.S. bank were successfully hacked,\"it would have an order-of-magnitude greater impact on the global economy\"than the September 11, 2001, attacks. McConnell warned,\"the ability to threaten the U.S. money supply is the equivalent of today's nuclear weapon.\"14 A cyber attack on the banking system could shut down the system that clears all financial transactions, thus undermining all confidence in the monetary system.\nIn a cyber war, it is difficult to determine the source of an attack or the attacker's identity. The ability to backtrack a cyber attack to the source depends on a rapid response capability on the order of seconds, minutes, or hours. The pathways used by hackers may only be active for milliseconds and often there is no identifying evidence that remains once the hacker has completed his objective. In the case of the Team Cymru study, the team could not identify whether military organizations, intelligence agencies, terrorists, criminals, or inventive individuals were the source of the cyber attacks.[15] Even if the physical origin of an attack can be identified, there is no guarantee that the hacker behind the attack is sponsored by that country or that the hacker is even located within the given country.[16] A new type of cyber warfare that is growing is hybrid warfare.[17] National governments rather than individual hackers carry out this type of attack. Hybrid warfare is a cyber attack that is timed to coincide with a conventional military offensive. A cyber attack using mass communication sources in conjunction with a conventional military attack may also be used to influence global public opinion.[18] Hybrid warfare is particularly threatening because it is designed to prevent an effective response by the targeted country to a physical attack.\nAn offensive tool in the cyber arsenal is the botnet, a collection of computers that have been compromised by malicious software. The program commandeers the infected machines, creating a vast network. The compromised computers, known as\"zombies,\"can be remotely controlled, often without the knowledge of anyone using the zombie computer. The zombie network can be instructed to attack a designated target by overwhelming it with thousands of commands.[19] In an actual cyber war, a successful cyber attack would target computer-dependent infrastructure, such as a nation's power grid or banking system. Also, an attack on a nation's air traffic control system could blind the air traffic controllers' air defense networks, hindering an effective counterstrike.[20] # USE OF CYBER WARFARE BY FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE SERVICES ## CYBER ATTACK ON ESTONIA In 2007, Estonia was subject to a prolonged cyber attack suspected of being sponsored by Russia. Estonia, a developed former Soviet Republic, has a high level of access to advanced communications technology. The Estonian government shifted all of its major government operations to the Internet in 2005. The government LBJ JOURNAL OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS holds all cabinet meetings online and documents are signed with e-signatures. Beginning in March 2007, Estonians can even vote online.21 Over 60 percent of the population has online access to bank accounts and 95 percent of banking transactions are online.22 Russian hackers were patiently waiting for a pretext to test Estonia's cyber defenses.\nIn April 2007, the Estonian government decided to relocate a monument that commemorated the Soviet armed forces' contribution to liberating Estonia from Nazi control during World War II. Moving the monument from the center of Tallinn, the capital, to a military cemetery outside the city sparked protests and riots among the Russian minority. The event may have provided the pretext, and the unrest was closely followed by distributed denial of service (DDOS) attacks originating in Russia.23 A call to action and step-by-step instructions about how to carry out DDOS attacks spread through Russian chat rooms. The Estonian government websites that normally received 1,000 visitors per day suddenly started receiving 2,000 visits per second.24 Anyone who attempted to access the target sites had their computer screens frozen.25 The websites of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Justice shut down, and the Prime Minister Andrus Ansip's Reform Party website was defaced by the addition of an image of Prime Minister Ansip with an Adolf Hitler mustache. The Russian hackers also briefly disabled the national emergency phone number.26 The United States and NATO sent computer security teams to aid the Estonian authorities to cope with the DDOS waves that overpowered the country's government websites, banking industry, and media organizations. The clandestine groups of hackers were not confirmed to be operating with Russian sponsorship, but evidence suggests the Russian authorities were at least complicit.27 The unusual aspect of the attacks was that they lasted for several weeks and had a very high intensity. Some of the botnets used in the DDOS attacks included up to 100,000 zombie computers. The commandeered computers directed large amounts of data at Estonia's government websites and banking system.28 The US-NATO efforts stabilized the situation, but intermittent attacks continued until mid-May 2007.29 In response to the cyber attacks, NATO established the Cooperative Defense Center in Estonia in May 2008. The center is staffed by 30 cyber specialists and is part of NATO's network of Centers of Excellence accredited to train representatives from member states about technical aspects of NATO operations.30 However, the new center's vulnerability was shown with the capture of Herman Simm in September 2008, which also further implicated Russia in the cyber attack on Estonia.31 Herman Simm, 61, was a high ranking official working in the Estonian Ministry of Defense. In 2001, he was appointed head of the State Secret Protection Office. He also developed the information protection systems for NATO and the European Union, frequently leading Estonian talks on protecting classified data. He was described as being “at the cutting edge of NATO's most important new strategic missions: to defend the alliance against cyber-attack.”32 Recruited as an asset by Russia in the late 1980s, he was accused of providing classified U.S. missile shield and cyber defense information to the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service for millions of dollars. The Estonian government issued Simm CYBER WARFARE SPRING 2012 a diplomatic passport that he used to personally transfer documents abroad.³³ Although it is unknown if he had other accomplices within the government, Simm oversaw the issuance of security clearances for Estonian intelligence, military, and security agencies.³⁴ An Estonian court convicted Simm of treason in February 2009. He was ordered to pay $1.6 million and sentenced to 12 years in prison for damage to security systems.³⁵ In November 2008, the United States DOD computers were subject to a retaliatory cyber attack thought to originate in Russia.³⁶ The attack spread throughout the computer network via agent.btz malware, which was designed specifically to target military computers. The malware damaged computer networks in U.S. Central Command, including computers used in Iraq and Afghanistan. The attack also penetrated another highly classified DOD network.³⁷ The Pentagon banned all use of flash drives, which was believed to be the method of delivering the malware to the computer network. Several intelligence sources say evidence indicates Russian government involvement, which if correct, would make it the first time a major cyber power successfully invaded classified U.S. military networks.³⁸ In April 2009, NATO expelled two Russians. One was the son of Vladimir Chizhov, the Russian ambassador to the European Union.³⁹ He and the other diplomat were assigned to Russia's mission to NATO and were suspected of working undercover as spies. The computer systems of NATO and the DOD have since been upgraded with\"enhanced security measures.\"⁴⁰ # RUSSIA-GEORGIA WAR The Russia-Georgia War of 2008 may be the first instance of the use of hybrid warfare in which a cyber attack preceded a conventional military strike. Despite the Russian government's denial of involvement in the cyber attack, the planning, servers of Russian state-owned businesses, and timing of the attack suggest some degree of coordination or direction by the Russian government.⁴¹ The cyber attack began with a series of small-scale DDOS attacks in June 2008, two months prior to the five-day war over the breakaway region of South Ossetia.⁴² The cyber attacks made use of botnets, which loaded computers with malicious software. The hackers then ordered the zombie computers to send millions of requests to designated websites to overwhelm the server causing it to shut down. On July 20, several DDOS attacks on President Mikhail Saakashvili's official website caused it to shut down for over 24 hours.⁴³ Reports indicated that the cyber attack came from a\"command-and-control server\"set up several weeks earlier in the United States, which shows that planning and coordination are not confined to national borders.⁴⁴ The U.S.-based server became operational many weeks ahead of the actual attacks, and by August 8, the first day of the war, the rate of cyber attacks had escalated to a very high level. Six botnets launched a coordinated cyber attack on Georgian government and media websites.⁴⁵ The cyber attacks also increased in intensity along with the physical conflict between Russian and Georgian troops. The websites of the President, Parliament, Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the National Bank of Georgia, and the online news agencies of The Messenger and Civil.ge all shut down. The websites of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the LBJ JOURNAL OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS National Bank were defaced by adding images comparing Saakashvili with Adolf Hitler.46 Although defacing a government website has a visual impact, shutting down online media sources during a military attack is characteristic of information warfare with the intent to disrupt communication and prevent dissemination of accurate information.\nThe Georgian government reacted by requesting permission from Google to transfer the websites of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Civil.ge to the Blogspot domain, which were better protected from the DDOS attacks.47 Atlanta-based Tulip Systems, Inc. agreed to host the President's website. Polish President Lech Kacyznski provided space on his website for official Georgian press releases, and Estonia hosted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and sent two information security specialists to support Georgian cyber defenses.48 Reports indicated that StopGeorgia.ru, which was established within hours of Russian forces entering South Ossetia, was a main coordinator of the cyber attacks.49 The forum provided a continuously updated list of target websites. It also encouraged visitors to download DoSHTTP, a free software program, to allow them to participate in the DDOS attacks.50 Project Grey Goose, an independent project launched by cyber specialist Jeff Carr and 100 computer security, technology, and intelligence volunteers, attempted to determine the source of the cyber attacks. Although, the group was unable to verify Russian-sponsorship of StopGeorgia.ru and another website, Xakep.ru, it is still reasonable to conclude a link exists. Russian government members clearly supported the sites' efforts and their implied consent by refusing to take action against the sites to stop the cyber attacks.51 Project Grey Goose also found that the hackers made extensive use of SQL attacks, which are simpler than DDOS attacks. The SQL attacks exploit vulnerabilities within MySQL, a popular open source software which websites commonly use to manage databases. The targeted database is overwhelmed with millions of extraneous queries, shutting down the server. The benefit of using a combined SQL and DDOS attack is that it is very difficult to detect.52 SQL attacks also do not require as many computers to have the same impact as a DDOS attack that cannot be kept up without botnets. The methods used showed “planning, organization, targeted reconnaissance, and evolution of attacks.”53 The cyber attacks on Georgia in 2008 did not cause nearly the damage that they did in Estonia in 2007 because Georgia's economy and infrastructure are not fully integrated to the Internet—only 7 percent of the country has access to the Internet, with only limited coverage outside Tiblisi.54 Nevertheless, the attacks disrupted timely dissemination of information by the Georgian government and forced it to seek alternative methods for distributing information to the international community.\n### China and Cyber Attacks China is a main threat to cyber security because of the large number of Internet users and because of the high number of attacks originating in the country that are more sophisticated than other actors.55 China also regards cyber warfare as CYBER WARFARE SPRING 2012 a central component in future conflicts, such as with the United States, where a direct confrontation would be difficult.56 This is an example of asymmetric warfare, where one actor, a country or non-state entity, undermines another country's strength by exploiting its weaknesses.57 Asymmetric conflict involves a tactical operation whose objective is to prevent the opponent from engaging in battle. This vision makes sense from China's perspective because it must counter the United States' technological advantage. Cyber attacks from China are not new. China launched cyber attacks in response to U.S. planes bombing the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, and following the crash of a Chinese fighter after it collided with a U.S. surveillance plane. In 2002, U.S. government servers were the target of coordinated cyber attacks, code-named Titan Rain, which originated in China.58 Targeted locations included the U.S. Army Information Systems Engineering Command, the Naval Ocean Systems Center, the Missile Defense Agency, and Sandia National Laboratories. China downloaded between 10 and 20 terabytes of data, or roughly the amount of information contained in the entire Library of Congress. The cyber attacks sought to gain information about military and government activities. China also conducted reconnaissance of the U.S. command and control system, information that it could use in future cyber attacks.59 In addition to the United States, China has targeted other Western nations. The German Vice President of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution, Hans Elmar Remberg, accused China of carrying out computer network intrusions on an\"almost daily\"basis.60 French Secretary-General of National Defense Francis Delon confirmed that the Chinese had targeted many French government websites in September 2007.61 In November 2007, MI-5 Director Jonathan Evans warned financial service companies that they were the targets of\"state-sponsored computer network exploitation.\"62 In the cyber attacks on the British financial system, the Chinese hackers were suspected of successfully obtaining strategic plans and risk management systems of Lehman brothers, Britain's Bradford &amp; Bingley, and Iceland's Landsbanki.63 Chinese hackers associated with the People's Liberation Army (PLA) carried out an attack on Pentagon computer networks that lasted for several weeks in 2007.64 The cyber attacks overpowered the defenses mounted by U.S. military computer experts. The cyber attacks overpowered the defenses mounted by U.S. military computer experts. The Chinese hackers gained accessed to the unclassified computer system that supports the Secretary of Defense. To avoid further damage, the Pentagon shut down the network.65 The cyber attack resulted in the creation of the National Cyber Investigative Joint Task Force to\"coordinate, integrate, and share information related to all domestic cyber threat investigations.\"66 By 2005, the Chinese PLA had formed\"information warfare militia units\"charged with developing viruses to attack enemy computer systems and networks.67 There are thought to be about 250 hacker groups in China that are either tolerated or encouraged by the government.68 One such group was the Network Crack Program Hacker (NCPH) that had ties to the PLA. NCPH developed software that allowed remote control of network programs, enabling the organization to steal government documents. NCPH also took advantage of holes in Microsoft Of LBJ JOURNAL OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS VOL. 20 CYBER WARFARE China is interested in aggressively acquiring commercial secrets and information on future weapons systems.⁷¹ The closed and authoritarian nature of the Chinese state and its tight regulation of the Internet make it tough to imagine large hacker communities operating freely without state supervision. The lack of transparency regarding Chinese military modernization and yearly increases in military expenditures is a main concern for the Pentagon. Chinese use of cyber warfare is becoming increasingly sophisticated. Although, the Chinese space program is focused mostly on civilian uses, it is providing the PLA with the ability to track U.S. forces in the western Pacific Ocean. China's advances in cyber technology will jeopardize the U.S. military communication systems that depend on wireless communications and computer networks.⁷² In addition, China is targeting defense contractors, such as Raytheon, Lockheed Martin, Boeing, and Northrop Grumman, all of which have had their unclassified networks penetrated by Chinese hackers. In 2005, Chinese hackers were able to obtain the Army's and Air Force's flight planning software from Redstone Arsenal, Alabama.⁷³ Furthermore, Chinese operations have been detected inside certain U.S. electricity grids. The Chinese have the capability to map electric networks and leave behind malicious software to sabotage networks later. Former DNI McConnell stated he would be surprised if tools and capabilities have not been left in computer and information systems that could be put into action at some time in the future.⁷⁴ Current waves of cyber attacks from China are aimed mainly at collecting information and probing defenses. China is likely to continue to exploit U.S. dependence on cyberspace because of low operations costs compared to traditional espionage methods or military activities. Cyber attacks create confusion, and there is no legal framework for cyber warfare.⁷⁵ An international legal framework provides a basis for deterring cyber attacks by creating a cost and international pressure for violating an accepted norm.⁷⁶ ## A CYBER ARMS RACE The cyber attacks being detected today and the use of hybrid warfare in the Russia-Georgia War are the beginning of a new international race to develop cyber weapons and the defenses to protect against them. As the Internet spreads to ever more distant parts of the world, and national economies become increasingly LBJ JOURNAL OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS CYBER WARFARE SPRING 2012 integrated into the World Wide Web, the desire to acquire both offensive and defensive cyber capabilities by states and non-state actors will multiply. China is an advanced technology products exporting power and a leader in the semiconductor industry, which gives it unique access to technology components.77 This access also provides a potential opening for launching cyber attacks.78 If an imminent attack was detected, some officials argue that the United States should pre-emptively strike the source, ranging from an online attack to a physical strike, as a means to deter future cyber attacks.79 Other officials argue that pre-emptive attacks would provide justification for foreign governments to invest in their own efforts to engage in cyber warfare and to pre-emptively attack the United States.80 With the numbers of hackers and the superior computing ability that comes from harnessing tens of thousands of computers around the world in botnets, someone will find a way to breach a network security system. In the long run, it is not possible to simply build more advanced cyber defenses. The best defense against a cyber attack is to develop a robust capability to engage in cyber war and develop the necessary defenses to mitigate a cyber attack.\nThe benefit of Eligible Receiver in the early days of cyber attacks is that federal agencies, research groups, and military contractors now frequently run war games to assess U.S. vulnerabilities. Although President Obama has not spoken openly about whether he supports or opposes cyber weapons, it would be irresponsible not to develop them to protect against attacks. These capabilities are also critical because they can provide vital intelligence, and foreign intelligence services are already using such capabilities, or investing heavily in developing them. U.S. intelligence agencies could activate code embedded in computer chips during the manufacturing process that would enable the U.S. to remotely control an enemy's computers over the Internet. However, the U.S. potentially runs the same risk from computer chips made in China.\nCurrently, there is no broad authorization for American forces to engage in cyber war. Former President Bush attempted to include a section to improve U.S. cyber defenses in a classified set of presidential orders in January 2008, but the administration failed to agree on how to write the authorization.81 Instead, President Bush authorized individual uses of cyber warfare in Iraq and Iran.82 In 2003, the Pentagon and U.S. intelligence agencies made plans for a cyber attack on Saddam Hussein's bank accounts. The plan would have frozen billions of dollars and crippled the Iraqi government's financial system in advance of the U.S. invasion of Iraq. Saddam Hussein would have had no money for war supplies or money to pay troops.83 Bush administration officials were concerned that the plan might not be limited to Iraq, potentially causing global financial disorder, spreading throughout the Middle East to Europe, and to the United States. Therefore, the plan was never carried out. However, President Bush did approve a plan to disable Iraq's military and government communications.84 The U.S. government contacted international communications companies that provided satellite and cell phone coverage in Iraq to warn them about jamming and to request support by turning off their signals. The communications jamming did affect surrounding countries that shared communication systems with Iraq, but the damage was considered LBJ JOURNAL OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS VOL. 20 CYBER WARFARE\n\n## DISCUSSION\nPresident Obama expanded a $17 billion, five-year program, known as the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative, authorized by President Bush in 2008.⁸⁶ In December 2009, President Obama appointed Howard Schmidt to fill the White House cyber security coordinator, after Melissa Hathaway resigned in August 2009, citing delays in the appointment process.⁸⁷ Secretary Robert Gates approved the creation of the U.S. Cyber Command (USCYBERCOMM) headed by the director of the National Security Agency, to be the nation's central hub for cyber capabilities. USCYBERCOMM incorporates the Joint Task Force-Global Network Operations (JTF-GNO) and the Joint Functional Component Command-Network Warfare (JFCC-NW). The organization will build the defenses for military computers and communications systems as well as developing and deploying cyber weapons.⁸⁸ The Pentagon has already commissioned military contractors to develop a classified version of the future Internet, known as the National Cyber Range, on which to test simulated cyber attacks to improve U.S. defenses.⁸⁹\nIt is clear the rapid dissemination of information and technology will only magnify the threat of cyber warfare in years to come. The Russian-based attacks on Estonia and Georgia showed how cyber attacks defy state borders and raise difficult issues of jurisdiction. It also shows Russia's preference of using cyber attacks to settle scores with former Soviet states. In addition, China is exhibiting a keen interest in industrial espionage and aggressive intelligence gathering through cyber attacks against Western governments. In April 2011, President Obama announced the National Strategy for Trusted Identities in Cyberspace as a means to increase trustworthiness of identities in online transactions in response to fraud and identity thefts.⁹⁰ The U.S. will have to spearhead the formation of a legal framework for this new challenge, complete with definition of vital terms and rules of the game. The main tenets of warfare embedded in the UN Geneva Conventions will have to be revised to incorporate cyber warfare because it blurs the principles of proportionality, neutrality, and distinction. Yet the most serious problem of cyber warfare is that countries do not know how good the weapons are until they are used.\n## ENDNOTES\n\nLBJ JOURNAL OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS CYBER WARFARE SPRING 2012\n\nLBJ JOURNAL OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS VOL. 20 CYBER WARFARE\n\nLBJ JOURNAL OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS CYBER WARFARE SPRING 2012\n\nLBJ JOURNAL OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS VOL. 20 CYBER WARFARE\n\nLBJ JOURNAL OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS CYBER WARFARE SPRING 2012\n\nLBJ JOURNAL OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS VOL. 20 CYBER WARFARE 39"

While cyberspace is often viewed as a virtual world, it is composed of vulnerable physical infrastructure. The vast amount of digital infrastructure that supports the Internet, the economy, the government, and the military makes it nearly impossible to guarantee total security. The more dependent a country becomes on the Internet and the more interconnected its systems become, the more vulnerable the country is to hackers or foreign intelligence services conducting espionage. The National Intelligence Council stated in its most recent quadrennial report, Global Trends 2025: A Transformed World, that the increasing use of cyber warfare is one of the primary factors that \"will constrict U.S. freedom of action.\" It is particularly difficult for the U.S. government to respond to cyber attacks because it is very difficult to track the source of an attack and to determine who initiated it. The international race to build cyber defenses and to develop offensive capabilities, as well as the lack of law governing cyberspace, makes cyber warfare one of the most urgent national security problems facing the United States.\n# CYBERSPACE IS A REAL AND GROWING THREAT\nCyberspace is wrongly viewed as something that cannot be seen, only existing in a virtual form. Cyberspace is real and has very physical components. It exists in the computer systems that enable Wall Street to function and it forms the backbone of all major companies. Cyberspace also exists in the critical infrastructure that allows computers to communicate with each other, such as the main communication trunk line from Europe to the United States that comes up on the New Jersey shore. It plays a major role in the functioning of software, computers, and\nLBJ JOURNAL OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS\nCYBER WARFARE\nSPRING 2012\ncell phones, all of which are now common in daily life. Cyberspace includes the broadband networks, wireless signals, and local area networks in schools. It also encompasses the critical military and intelligence networks designed to protect the United States. While the Internet has made society more interconnected than at any time in history, it has also made it easier for domestic and foreign hackers to disrupt daily life.\nCyber attack refers to a deliberate action to \"alter, disrupt, deceive, degrade, or destroy\" networks, computer systems, or programs that may be contained on a computer or moving through a system.² A cyber attack generally involves penetrating a computer network as a means to disrupt an opponent's critical services, such as accessing a utility control system. Groups that operate independently or with state sponsorship that can gain access to intellectual property or classified military information are a growing threat. However, there are legitimate uses of cyber attacks. The United States prepares to conduct cyber attacks in conjunction with other information warfare methods and with conventional attacks to protect national security. Domestic law enforcement also engages in cyber attacks when jamming devices are used to prevent cell phone calls when suspected to be used to detonate a bomb.\nCyber attacks became much more common during the late 1990s, including such cases as the 1998 Internet Worm, Melissa Virus, I-LOVE-YOU virus, Code Red Virus, and the Nimda Virus. Initially, attacks consisted of malware, such as viruses and worms. Today, cyber attacks are increasingly sophisticated and adaptive. Security breaches and information theft are commonplace in the news. Foreign intelligence services from countries such as China, Israel, Iran, Russia, and the United States have used cyber capabilities defensively and offensively.\nThe first major test of the U.S. government's cyber infrastructure from cyber attacks was Eligible Receiver in June 1997, a Joint Staff test exercise run by the Department of Defense (DOD).³ The unannounced exercise targeted 20 different agencies and revealed significant vulnerabilities within the U.S. government's information infrastructures. A team of 35 computer experts from the National Security Agency split into four teams to simulate hackers trying to penetrate U.S. computer networks. The teams used publicly available information and tools found on the Internet and commercial Internet accounts to exploit actual vulnerabilities. Over the next two weeks they successfully hacked into power grids of nine U.S. cities and cracked their 911 emergency systems. They also attacked the Pentagon's computer networks, gaining access to 36 of them. Only two of the attacks were detected. Once inside the systems, the teams had complete access and were able to issue fake orders and news reports about the crisis. As a result, no one in the entire chain of command could be certain of what was accurate. If it had been a real attack, the four teams would have been able to prevent the United States from responding effectively.⁴\nThe severity of security challenges posed by cyber warfare to any country is highly related to the degree of its dependence on modern information and communications technology. Countries with advanced internet accessibility, including widespread online commerce and banking, possess far more vulnerabilities to at-\nLBJ JOURNAL OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS\nVOL. 20\nCYBER WARFARE\n25\ntack. Countries with limited reliance on information technology (IT) are much less exposed, but still susceptible to cyber attacks. For example, an undercover Defense Department employee said that it would be possible to hit three undisclosed communication \"nodes\" in the United States and severely impair communications across the country.⁵ The Department of Energy conducted an experiment, the Aurora Generator Test, to determine if a 27-ton power generator could be disabled using the Internet.⁶ The group of scientists was able to hack into the control system and use the controls to cause the generator to shudder, overheat, and eventually to fatally malfunction. In a real world scenario, losing several large power generators would cause a prolonged disruption. The generators are expensive, made overseas, and require up to four months to obtain. A well-targeted cyber attack could shut down a power plant for months.⁷ The power grid is one of the most vulnerable infrastructure systems to cyber attack in part because it is operated by private utilities that are not required to comply with government security decrees.⁸ With the move toward a Smart Grid, which relies on interconnected networks of computer-controlled nodes, its vulnerability could increase because each node would operate automatically over the Internet to regulate the flow of power. If the nodes are not secure, they can be hacked and used to disrupt the delivery of electricity.⁹ Additionally, there are only about five software systems used to run power grids, dams, utilities, and pipelines that rely on wireless supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems in which one node provides instructions to another node in the chain. If compromised, the SCADA system could send fake instructions, potentially causing severe damage to critical infrastructure. One of the benefits of the outdated air traffic control system in the U.S. is that because it is so old, it is not directly connected to the Internet, and is less susceptible to a cyber attack.¹⁰\nEvery day there are thousands of cyber attacks on federal and private computer systems. The DOD estimated that in 2007 there were 43,880 incidents of malicious activity from all sources on five million computers, a 31 percent increase from 2006.¹¹ Some attacks are malicious, but others appear to be testing the chinks in the patchwork of firewalls. The most dangerous aspect is the attacks that go undetected by common security tools. The number of attacks is increasing and they are becoming increasingly bold. In January 2008, a Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) official stated that the CIA knew hackers had disrupted or threatened to disrupt power in four foreign cities.¹² The enormous challenge of defending cyber infrastructure ranges from forensic tasks to determine attack attribution to the broader concern of proportionality of a response and what is considered a legitimate target.\nA CSIS panel researched potential vulnerabilities and determined that the main threat is not the capabilities of individual hackers but the capabilities of other nations, such as China and Russia. Team Cymru, a research company, reviewed Internet scans that attempted to enter industrial control systems. Scans originated from 14 different countries, including China, Iran, Israel, Russia, Taiwan, and even the United States. The Team Cymru results showed that 90 percent of the scans originated in China.¹³\nLBJ JOURNAL OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS\nCYBER WARFARE\nSPRING 2012\nAlthough scanning alone does not cause any damage to computer systems, it could be a preliminary step in an actual attack that would scramble databases or control computers. Former Director of National Intelligence (DNI) Mike McConnell told President Bush in 2007 that if a large U.S. bank were successfully hacked, \"it would have an order-of-magnitude greater impact on the global economy\" than the September 11, 2001, attacks. McConnell warned, \"the ability to threaten the U.S. money supply is the equivalent of today's nuclear weapon.\"14 A cyber attack on the banking system could shut down the system that clears all financial transactions, thus undermining all confidence in the monetary system.\nIn a cyber war, it is difficult to determine the source of an attack or the attacker's identity. The ability to backtrack a cyber attack to the source depends on a rapid response capability on the order of seconds, minutes, or hours. The pathways used by hackers may only be active for milliseconds and often there is no identifying evidence that remains once the hacker has completed his objective. In the case of the Team Cymru study, the team could not identify whether military organizations, intelligence agencies, terrorists, criminals, or inventive individuals were the source of the cyber attacks. Even if the physical origin of an attack can be identified, there is no guarantee that the hacker behind the attack is sponsored by that country or that the hacker is even located within the given country.\nA new type of cyber warfare that is growing is hybrid warfare. National governments rather than individual hackers carry out this type of attack. Hybrid warfare is a cyber attack that is timed to coincide with a conventional military offensive. A cyber attack using mass communication sources in conjunction with a conventional military attack may also be used to influence global public opinion. Hybrid warfare is particularly threatening because it is designed to prevent an effective response by the targeted country to a physical attack.\nAn offensive tool in the cyber arsenal is the botnet, a collection of computers that have been compromised by malicious software. The program commandeers the infected machines, creating a vast network. The compromised computers, known as \"zombies,\" can be remotely controlled, often without the knowledge of anyone using the zombie computer. The zombie network can be instructed to attack a designated target by overwhelming it with thousands of commands. In an actual cyber war, a successful cyber attack would target computer-dependent infrastructure, such as a nation's power grid or banking system. Also, an attack on a nation's air traffic control system could blind the air traffic controllers' air defense networks, hindering an effective counterstrike.\n# USE OF CYBER WARFARE BY FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE SERVICES\n## CYBER ATTACK ON ESTONIA\nIn 2007, Estonia was subject to a prolonged cyber attack suspected of being sponsored by Russia. Estonia, a developed former Soviet Republic, has a high level of access to advanced communications technology. The Estonian government shifted all of its major government operations to the Internet in 2005. The government\nLBJ JOURNAL OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS\nholds all cabinet meetings online and documents are signed with e-signatures. Beginning in March 2007, Estonians can even vote online.21 Over 60 percent of the population has online access to bank accounts and 95 percent of banking transactions are online.22 Russian hackers were patiently waiting for a pretext to test Estonia's cyber defenses.\nIn April 2007, the Estonian government decided to relocate a monument that commemorated the Soviet armed forces' contribution to liberating Estonia from Nazi control during World War II. Moving the monument from the center of Tallinn, the capital, to a military cemetery outside the city sparked protests and riots among the Russian minority. The event may have provided the pretext, and the unrest was closely followed by distributed denial of service (DDOS) attacks originating in Russia.23 A call to action and step-by-step instructions about how to carry out DDOS attacks spread through Russian chat rooms. The Estonian government websites that normally received 1,000 visitors per day suddenly started receiving 2,000 visits per second.24 Anyone who attempted to access the target sites had their computer screens frozen.25 The websites of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Justice shut down, and the Prime Minister Andrus Ansip's Reform Party website was defaced by the addition of an image of Prime Minister Ansip with an Adolf Hitler mustache. The Russian hackers also briefly disabled the national emergency phone number.26\nThe United States and NATO sent computer security teams to aid the Estonian authorities to cope with the DDOS waves that overpowered the country's government websites, banking industry, and media organizations. The clandestine groups of hackers were not confirmed to be operating with Russian sponsorship, but evidence suggests the Russian authorities were at least complicit.27 The unusual aspect of the attacks was that they lasted for several weeks and had a very high intensity. Some of the botnets used in the DDOS attacks included up to 100,000 zombie computers. The commandeered computers directed large amounts of data at Estonia's government websites and banking system.28 The US-NATO efforts stabilized the situation, but intermittent attacks continued until mid-May 2007.29\nIn response to the cyber attacks, NATO established the Cooperative Defense Center in Estonia in May 2008. The center is staffed by 30 cyber specialists and is part of NATO's network of Centers of Excellence accredited to train representatives from member states about technical aspects of NATO operations.30 However, the new center's vulnerability was shown with the capture of Herman Simm in September 2008, which also further implicated Russia in the cyber attack on Estonia.31\nHerman Simm, 61, was a high ranking official working in the Estonian Ministry of Defense. In 2001, he was appointed head of the State Secret Protection Office. He also developed the information protection systems for NATO and the European Union, frequently leading Estonian talks on protecting classified data. He was described as being “at the cutting edge of NATO's most important new strategic missions: to defend the alliance against cyber-attack.”32\nRecruited as an asset by Russia in the late 1980s, he was accused of providing classified U.S. missile shield and cyber defense information to the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service for millions of dollars. The Estonian government issued Simm\nCYBER WARFARE\nSPRING 2012\na diplomatic passport that he used to personally transfer documents abroad.³³ Although it is unknown if he had other accomplices within the government, Simm oversaw the issuance of security clearances for Estonian intelligence, military, and security agencies.³⁴ An Estonian court convicted Simm of treason in February 2009. He was ordered to pay $1.6 million and sentenced to 12 years in prison for damage to security systems.³⁵\nIn November 2008, the United States DOD computers were subject to a retaliatory cyber attack thought to originate in Russia.³⁶ The attack spread throughout the computer network via agent.btz malware, which was designed specifically to target military computers. The malware damaged computer networks in U.S. Central Command, including computers used in Iraq and Afghanistan. The attack also penetrated another highly classified DOD network.³⁷ The Pentagon banned all use of flash drives, which was believed to be the method of delivering the malware to the computer network. Several intelligence sources say evidence indicates Russian government involvement, which if correct, would make it the first time a major cyber power successfully invaded classified U.S. military networks.³⁸\nIn April 2009, NATO expelled two Russians. One was the son of Vladimir Chizhov, the Russian ambassador to the European Union.³⁹ He and the other diplomat were assigned to Russia's mission to NATO and were suspected of working undercover as spies. The computer systems of NATO and the DOD have since been upgraded with \"enhanced security measures.\"⁴⁰\n# RUSSIA-GEORGIA WAR\nThe Russia-Georgia War of 2008 may be the first instance of the use of hybrid warfare in which a cyber attack preceded a conventional military strike. Despite the Russian government's denial of involvement in the cyber attack, the planning, servers of Russian state-owned businesses, and timing of the attack suggest some degree of coordination or direction by the Russian government.⁴¹ The cyber attack began with a series of small-scale DDOS attacks in June 2008, two months prior to the five-day war over the breakaway region of South Ossetia.⁴² The cyber attacks made use of botnets, which loaded computers with malicious software. The hackers then ordered the zombie computers to send millions of requests to designated websites to overwhelm the server causing it to shut down. On July 20, several DDOS attacks on President Mikhail Saakashvili's official website caused it to shut down for over 24 hours.⁴³ Reports indicated that the cyber attack came from a \"command-and-control server\" set up several weeks earlier in the United States, which shows that planning and coordination are not confined to national borders.⁴⁴ The U.S.-based server became operational many weeks ahead of the actual attacks, and by August 8, the first day of the war, the rate of cyber attacks had escalated to a very high level. Six botnets launched a coordinated cyber attack on Georgian government and media websites.⁴⁵ The cyber attacks also increased in intensity along with the physical conflict between Russian and Georgian troops. The websites of the President, Parliament, Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the National Bank of Georgia, and the online news agencies of The Messenger and Civil.ge all shut down. The websites of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the\nLBJ JOURNAL OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS\nNational Bank were defaced by adding images comparing Saakashvili with Adolf Hitler.46 Although defacing a government website has a visual impact, shutting down online media sources during a military attack is characteristic of information warfare with the intent to disrupt communication and prevent dissemination of accurate information.\nThe Georgian government reacted by requesting permission from Google to transfer the websites of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Civil.ge to the Blogspot domain, which were better protected from the DDOS attacks.47 Atlanta-based Tulip Systems, Inc. agreed to host the President's website. Polish President Lech Kacyznski provided space on his website for official Georgian press releases, and Estonia hosted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and sent two information security specialists to support Georgian cyber defenses.48\nReports indicated that StopGeorgia.ru, which was established within hours of Russian forces entering South Ossetia, was a main coordinator of the cyber attacks.49 The forum provided a continuously updated list of target websites. It also encouraged visitors to download DoSHTTP, a free software program, to allow them to participate in the DDOS attacks.50\nProject Grey Goose, an independent project launched by cyber specialist Jeff Carr and 100 computer security, technology, and intelligence volunteers, attempted to determine the source of the cyber attacks. Although, the group was unable to verify Russian-sponsorship of StopGeorgia.ru and another website, Xakep.ru, it is still reasonable to conclude a link exists. Russian government members clearly supported the sites' efforts and their implied consent by refusing to take action against the sites to stop the cyber attacks.51 Project Grey Goose also found that the hackers made extensive use of SQL attacks, which are simpler than DDOS attacks. The SQL attacks exploit vulnerabilities within MySQL, a popular open source software which websites commonly use to manage databases. The targeted database is overwhelmed with millions of extraneous queries, shutting down the server. The benefit of using a combined SQL and DDOS attack is that it is very difficult to detect.52 SQL attacks also do not require as many computers to have the same impact as a DDOS attack that cannot be kept up without botnets. The methods used showed “planning, organization, targeted reconnaissance, and evolution of attacks.”53\nThe cyber attacks on Georgia in 2008 did not cause nearly the damage that they did in Estonia in 2007 because Georgia's economy and infrastructure are not fully integrated to the Internet—only 7 percent of the country has access to the Internet, with only limited coverage outside Tiblisi.54 Nevertheless, the attacks disrupted timely dissemination of information by the Georgian government and forced it to seek alternative methods for distributing information to the international community.\n### China and Cyber Attacks\nChina is a main threat to cyber security because of the large number of Internet users and because of the high number of attacks originating in the country that are more sophisticated than other actors.55 China also regards cyber warfare as\nCYBER WARFARE\nSPRING 2012\na central component in future conflicts, such as with the United States, where a direct confrontation would be difficult.56 This is an example of asymmetric warfare, where one actor, a country or non-state entity, undermines another country's strength by exploiting its weaknesses.57 Asymmetric conflict involves a tactical operation whose objective is to prevent the opponent from engaging in battle. This vision makes sense from China's perspective because it must counter the United States' technological advantage. Cyber attacks from China are not new. China launched cyber attacks in response to U.S. planes bombing the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, and following the crash of a Chinese fighter after it collided with a U.S. surveillance plane. In 2002, U.S. government servers were the target of coordinated cyber attacks, code-named Titan Rain, which originated in China.58 Targeted locations included the U.S. Army Information Systems Engineering Command, the Naval Ocean Systems Center, the Missile Defense Agency, and Sandia National Laboratories. China downloaded between 10 and 20 terabytes of data, or roughly the amount of information contained in the entire Library of Congress. The cyber attacks sought to gain information about military and government activities. China also conducted reconnaissance of the U.S. command and control system, information that it could use in future cyber attacks.59\nIn addition to the United States, China has targeted other Western nations. The German Vice President of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution, Hans Elmar Remberg, accused China of carrying out computer network intrusions on an \"almost daily\" basis.60 French Secretary-General of National Defense Francis Delon confirmed that the Chinese had targeted many French government websites in September 2007.61 In November 2007, MI-5 Director Jonathan Evans warned financial service companies that they were the targets of \"state-sponsored computer network exploitation.\"62 In the cyber attacks on the British financial system, the Chinese hackers were suspected of successfully obtaining strategic plans and risk management systems of Lehman brothers, Britain's Bradford &amp; Bingley, and Iceland's Landsbanki.63\nChinese hackers associated with the People's Liberation Army (PLA) carried out an attack on Pentagon computer networks that lasted for several weeks in 2007.64 The cyber attacks overpowered the defenses mounted by U.S. military computer experts. The cyber attacks overpowered the defenses mounted by U.S. military computer experts. The Chinese hackers gained accessed to the unclassified computer system that supports the Secretary of Defense. To avoid further damage, the Pentagon shut down the network.65 The cyber attack resulted in the creation of the National Cyber Investigative Joint Task Force to \"coordinate, integrate, and share information related to all domestic cyber threat investigations.\"66\nBy 2005, the Chinese PLA had formed \"information warfare militia units\" charged with developing viruses to attack enemy computer systems and networks.67 There are thought to be about 250 hacker groups in China that are either tolerated or encouraged by the government.68 One such group was the Network Crack Program Hacker (NCPH) that had ties to the PLA. NCPH developed software that allowed remote control of network programs, enabling the organization to steal government documents. NCPH also took advantage of holes in Microsoft Of\nLBJ JOURNAL OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS\nVOL. 20\nCYBER WARFARE\n31\nfice to insert Trojans that took partial control of the computers to extract files. In 2006, NCPH began using these programs to steal millions of unclassified U.S. government documents.⁶⁹ NCPH consisted of eight people in their early 20s who attended Sichuan University. The group first started hacking websites in China, eventually coming to the attention of the Sichuan Military Command Communication Department, which instructed them to participate in a cyber attack network training. After winning the provincial military command competition, the NCPH members entered advanced training consisting of simulated attacks, designing hacking tools, and drafting network-infiltration techniques. Eventually, the NCPH gained a benefactor, likely the PLA, which began subsidizing the group at $270 dollars per month.⁷⁰\nChina is interested in aggressively acquiring commercial secrets and information on future weapons systems.⁷¹ The closed and authoritarian nature of the Chinese state and its tight regulation of the Internet make it tough to imagine large hacker communities operating freely without state supervision. The lack of transparency regarding Chinese military modernization and yearly increases in military expenditures is a main concern for the Pentagon. Chinese use of cyber warfare is becoming increasingly sophisticated. Although, the Chinese space program is focused mostly on civilian uses, it is providing the PLA with the ability to track U.S. forces in the western Pacific Ocean. China's advances in cyber technology will jeopardize the U.S. military communication systems that depend on wireless communications and computer networks.⁷² In addition, China is targeting defense contractors, such as Raytheon, Lockheed Martin, Boeing, and Northrop Grumman, all of which have had their unclassified networks penetrated by Chinese hackers. In 2005, Chinese hackers were able to obtain the Army's and Air Force's flight planning software from Redstone Arsenal, Alabama.⁷³ Furthermore, Chinese operations have been detected inside certain U.S. electricity grids. The Chinese have the capability to map electric networks and leave behind malicious software to sabotage networks later. Former DNI McConnell stated he would be surprised if tools and capabilities have not been left in computer and information systems that could be put into action at some time in the future.⁷⁴\nCurrent waves of cyber attacks from China are aimed mainly at collecting information and probing defenses. China is likely to continue to exploit U.S. dependence on cyberspace because of low operations costs compared to traditional espionage methods or military activities. Cyber attacks create confusion, and there is no legal framework for cyber warfare.⁷⁵ An international legal framework provides a basis for deterring cyber attacks by creating a cost and international pressure for violating an accepted norm.⁷⁶\n## A CYBER ARMS RACE\nThe cyber attacks being detected today and the use of hybrid warfare in the Russia-Georgia War are the beginning of a new international race to develop cyber weapons and the defenses to protect against them. As the Internet spreads to ever more distant parts of the world, and national economies become increasingly\nLBJ JOURNAL OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS\nCYBER WARFARE\nSPRING 2012\nintegrated into the World Wide Web, the desire to acquire both offensive and defensive cyber capabilities by states and non-state actors will multiply. China is an advanced technology products exporting power and a leader in the semiconductor industry, which gives it unique access to technology components.77 This access also provides a potential opening for launching cyber attacks.78\nIf an imminent attack was detected, some officials argue that the United States should pre-emptively strike the source, ranging from an online attack to a physical strike, as a means to deter future cyber attacks.79 Other officials argue that pre-emptive attacks would provide justification for foreign governments to invest in their own efforts to engage in cyber warfare and to pre-emptively attack the United States.80 With the numbers of hackers and the superior computing ability that comes from harnessing tens of thousands of computers around the world in botnets, someone will find a way to breach a network security system. In the long run, it is not possible to simply build more advanced cyber defenses. The best defense against a cyber attack is to develop a robust capability to engage in cyber war and develop the necessary defenses to mitigate a cyber attack.\nThe benefit of Eligible Receiver in the early days of cyber attacks is that federal agencies, research groups, and military contractors now frequently run war games to assess U.S. vulnerabilities. Although President Obama has not spoken openly about whether he supports or opposes cyber weapons, it would be irresponsible not to develop them to protect against attacks. These capabilities are also critical because they can provide vital intelligence, and foreign intelligence services are already using such capabilities, or investing heavily in developing them. U.S. intelligence agencies could activate code embedded in computer chips during the manufacturing process that would enable the U.S. to remotely control an enemy's computers over the Internet. However, the U.S. potentially runs the same risk from computer chips made in China.\nCurrently, there is no broad authorization for American forces to engage in cyber war. Former President Bush attempted to include a section to improve U.S. cyber defenses in a classified set of presidential orders in January 2008, but the administration failed to agree on how to write the authorization.81 Instead, President Bush authorized individual uses of cyber warfare in Iraq and Iran.82\nIn 2003, the Pentagon and U.S. intelligence agencies made plans for a cyber attack on Saddam Hussein's bank accounts. The plan would have frozen billions of dollars and crippled the Iraqi government's financial system in advance of the U.S. invasion of Iraq. Saddam Hussein would have had no money for war supplies or money to pay troops.83 Bush administration officials were concerned that the plan might not be limited to Iraq, potentially causing global financial disorder, spreading throughout the Middle East to Europe, and to the United States. Therefore, the plan was never carried out. However, President Bush did approve a plan to disable Iraq's military and government communications.84 The U.S. government contacted international communications companies that provided satellite and cell phone coverage in Iraq to warn them about jamming and to request support by turning off their signals. The communications jamming did affect surrounding countries that shared communication systems with Iraq, but the damage was considered\nLBJ JOURNAL OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS\nVOL. 20\nCYBER WARFARE\n33\nacceptable by the Bush administration. Another cyber attack allowed the U.S. to hack into an Al Qaeda computer and alter information to lead an Al Qaeda group to where U.S. forces were waiting. President Bush also approved an experimental program that would allow the U.S. to slow Iran's progress towards production of a nuclear bomb.⁸⁵\n## DISCUSSION\nPresident Obama expanded a $17 billion, five-year program, known as the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative, authorized by President Bush in 2008.⁸⁶ In December 2009, President Obama appointed Howard Schmidt to fill the White House cyber security coordinator, after Melissa Hathaway resigned in August 2009, citing delays in the appointment process.⁸⁷ Secretary Robert Gates approved the creation of the U.S. Cyber Command (USCYBERCOMM) headed by the director of the National Security Agency, to be the nation's central hub for cyber capabilities. USCYBERCOMM incorporates the Joint Task Force-Global Network Operations (JTF-GNO) and the Joint Functional Component Command-Network Warfare (JFCC-NW). The organization will build the defenses for military computers and communications systems as well as developing and deploying cyber weapons.⁸⁸ The Pentagon has already commissioned military contractors to develop a classified version of the future Internet, known as the National Cyber Range, on which to test simulated cyber attacks to improve U.S. defenses.⁸⁹\nIt is clear the rapid dissemination of information and technology will only magnify the threat of cyber warfare in years to come. The Russian-based attacks on Estonia and Georgia showed how cyber attacks defy state borders and raise difficult issues of jurisdiction. It also shows Russia's preference of using cyber attacks to settle scores with former Soviet states. In addition, China is exhibiting a keen interest in industrial espionage and aggressive intelligence gathering through cyber attacks against Western governments. In April 2011, President Obama announced the National Strategy for Trusted Identities in Cyberspace as a means to increase trustworthiness of identities in online transactions in response to fraud and identity thefts.⁹⁰ The U.S. will have to spearhead the formation of a legal framework for this new challenge, complete with definition of vital terms and rules of the game. The main tenets of warfare embedded in the UN Geneva Conventions will have to be revised to incorporate cyber warfare because it blurs the principles of proportionality, neutrality, and distinction. Yet the most serious problem of cyber warfare is that countries do not know how good the weapons are until they are used.\n## ENDNOTES\n1.

While cyberspace is often viewed as a virtual world, it is composed of vulnerable physical infrastructure. The vast amount of digital infrastructure that supports the Internet, the economy, the government, and the military makes it nearly impossible to guarantee total security. The more dependent a country becomes on the Internet and the more interconnected its systems become, the more vulnerable the country is to hackers or foreign intelligence services conducting espionage. The National Intelligence Council stated in its most recent quadrennial report, Global Trends 2025: A Transformed World, that the increasing use of cyber warfare is one of the primary factors that\"will constrict U.S. freedom of action.\"It is particularly difficult for the U.S. government to respond to cyber attacks because it is very difficult to track the source of an attack and to determine who initiated it. The international race to build cyber defenses and to develop offensive capabilities, as well as the lack of law governing cyberspace, makes cyber warfare one of the most urgent national security problems facing the United States.\n# CYBERSPACE IS A REAL AND GROWING THREAT Cyberspace is wrongly viewed as something that cannot be seen, only existing in a virtual form. Cyberspace is real and has very physical components. It exists in the computer systems that enable Wall Street to function and it forms the backbone of all major companies. Cyberspace also exists in the critical infrastructure that allows computers to communicate with each other, such as the main communication trunk line from Europe to the United States that comes up on the New Jersey shore. It plays a major role in the functioning of software, computers, and LBJ JOURNAL OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS CYBER WARFARE SPRING 2012 cell phones, all of which are now common in daily life. Cyberspace includes the broadband networks, wireless signals, and local area networks in schools. It also encompasses the critical military and intelligence networks designed to protect the United States. While the Internet has made society more interconnected than at any time in history, it has also made it easier for domestic and foreign hackers to disrupt daily life.\nCyber attack refers to a deliberate action to\"alter, disrupt, deceive, degrade, or destroy\"networks, computer systems, or programs that may be contained on a computer or moving through a system.² A cyber attack generally involves penetrating a computer network as a means to disrupt an opponent's critical services, such as accessing a utility control system. Groups that operate independently or with state sponsorship that can gain access to intellectual property or classified military information are a growing threat. However, there are legitimate uses of cyber attacks. The United States prepares to conduct cyber attacks in conjunction with other information warfare methods and with conventional attacks to protect national security. Domestic law enforcement also engages in cyber attacks when jamming devices are used to prevent cell phone calls when suspected to be used to detonate a bomb.\nCyber attacks became much more common during the late 1990s, including such cases as the 1998 Internet Worm, Melissa Virus, I-LOVE-YOU virus, Code Red Virus, and the Nimda Virus. Initially, attacks consisted of malware, such as viruses and worms. Today, cyber attacks are increasingly sophisticated and adaptive. Security breaches and information theft are commonplace in the news. Foreign intelligence services from countries such as China, Israel, Iran, Russia, and the United States have used cyber capabilities defensively and offensively.\nThe first major test of the U.S. government's cyber infrastructure from cyber attacks was Eligible Receiver in June 1997, a Joint Staff test exercise run by the Department of Defense (DOD).³ The unannounced exercise targeted 20 different agencies and revealed significant vulnerabilities within the U.S. government's information infrastructures. A team of 35 computer experts from the National Security Agency split into four teams to simulate hackers trying to penetrate U.S. computer networks. The teams used publicly available information and tools found on the Internet and commercial Internet accounts to exploit actual vulnerabilities. Over the next two weeks they successfully hacked into power grids of nine U.S. cities and cracked their 911 emergency systems. They also attacked the Pentagon's computer networks, gaining access to 36 of them. Only two of the attacks were detected. Once inside the systems, the teams had complete access and were able to issue fake orders and news reports about the crisis. As a result, no one in the entire chain of command could be certain of what was accurate. If it had been a real attack, the four teams would have been able to prevent the United States from responding effectively.⁴ The severity of security challenges posed by cyber warfare to any country is highly related to the degree of its dependence on modern information and communications technology. Countries with advanced internet accessibility, including widespread online commerce and banking, possess far more vulnerabilities to at- LBJ JOURNAL OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS VOL. 20 CYBER WARFARE Every day there are thousands of cyber attacks on federal and private computer systems. The DOD estimated that in 2007 there were 43,880 incidents of malicious activity from all sources on five million computers, a 31 percent increase from 2006.¹¹ Some attacks are malicious, but others appear to be testing the chinks in the patchwork of firewalls. The most dangerous aspect is the attacks that go undetected by common security tools. The number of attacks is increasing and they are becoming increasingly bold. In January 2008, a Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) official stated that the CIA knew hackers had disrupted or threatened to disrupt power in four foreign cities.¹² The enormous challenge of defending cyber infrastructure ranges from forensic tasks to determine attack attribution to the broader concern of proportionality of a response and what is considered a legitimate target.\nA CSIS panel researched potential vulnerabilities and determined that the main threat is not the capabilities of individual hackers but the capabilities of other nations, such as China and Russia. Team Cymru, a research company, reviewed Internet scans that attempted to enter industrial control systems. Scans originated from 14 different countries, including China, Iran, Israel, Russia, Taiwan, and even the United States. The Team Cymru results showed that 90 percent of the scans originated in China.¹³ LBJ JOURNAL OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS CYBER WARFARE SPRING 2012 Although scanning alone does not cause any damage to computer systems, it could be a preliminary step in an actual attack that would scramble databases or control computers. Former Director of National Intelligence (DNI) Mike McConnell told President Bush in 2007 that if a large U.S. bank were successfully hacked,\"it would have an order-of-magnitude greater impact on the global economy\"than the September 11, 2001, attacks. McConnell warned,\"the ability to threaten the U.S. money supply is the equivalent of today's nuclear weapon.\"14 A cyber attack on the banking system could shut down the system that clears all financial transactions, thus undermining all confidence in the monetary system.\nIn a cyber war, it is difficult to determine the source of an attack or the attacker's identity. The ability to backtrack a cyber attack to the source depends on a rapid response capability on the order of seconds, minutes, or hours. The pathways used by hackers may only be active for milliseconds and often there is no identifying evidence that remains once the hacker has completed his objective. In the case of the Team Cymru study, the team could not identify whether military organizations, intelligence agencies, terrorists, criminals, or inventive individuals were the source of the cyber attacks.[15] Even if the physical origin of an attack can be identified, there is no guarantee that the hacker behind the attack is sponsored by that country or that the hacker is even located within the given country.[16] A new type of cyber warfare that is growing is hybrid warfare.[17] National governments rather than individual hackers carry out this type of attack. Hybrid warfare is a cyber attack that is timed to coincide with a conventional military offensive. A cyber attack using mass communication sources in conjunction with a conventional military attack may also be used to influence global public opinion.[18] Hybrid warfare is particularly threatening because it is designed to prevent an effective response by the targeted country to a physical attack.\nAn offensive tool in the cyber arsenal is the botnet, a collection of computers that have been compromised by malicious software. The program commandeers the infected machines, creating a vast network. The compromised computers, known as\"zombies,\"can be remotely controlled, often without the knowledge of anyone using the zombie computer. The zombie network can be instructed to attack a designated target by overwhelming it with thousands of commands.[19] In an actual cyber war, a successful cyber attack would target computer-dependent infrastructure, such as a nation's power grid or banking system. Also, an attack on a nation's air traffic control system could blind the air traffic controllers' air defense networks, hindering an effective counterstrike.[20] # USE OF CYBER WARFARE BY FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE SERVICES ## CYBER ATTACK ON ESTONIA In 2007, Estonia was subject to a prolonged cyber attack suspected of being sponsored by Russia. Estonia, a developed former Soviet Republic, has a high level of access to advanced communications technology. The Estonian government shifted all of its major government operations to the Internet in 2005. The government LBJ JOURNAL OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS holds all cabinet meetings online and documents are signed with e-signatures. Beginning in March 2007, Estonians can even vote online.21 Over 60 percent of the population has online access to bank accounts and 95 percent of banking transactions are online.22 Russian hackers were patiently waiting for a pretext to test Estonia's cyber defenses.\nIn April 2007, the Estonian government decided to relocate a monument that commemorated the Soviet armed forces' contribution to liberating Estonia from Nazi control during World War II. Moving the monument from the center of Tallinn, the capital, to a military cemetery outside the city sparked protests and riots among the Russian minority. The event may have provided the pretext, and the unrest was closely followed by distributed denial of service (DDOS) attacks originating in Russia.23 A call to action and step-by-step instructions about how to carry out DDOS attacks spread through Russian chat rooms. The Estonian government websites that normally received 1,000 visitors per day suddenly started receiving 2,000 visits per second.24 Anyone who attempted to access the target sites had their computer screens frozen.25 The websites of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Justice shut down, and the Prime Minister Andrus Ansip's Reform Party website was defaced by the addition of an image of Prime Minister Ansip with an Adolf Hitler mustache. The Russian hackers also briefly disabled the national emergency phone number.26 The United States and NATO sent computer security teams to aid the Estonian authorities to cope with the DDOS waves that overpowered the country's government websites, banking industry, and media organizations. The clandestine groups of hackers were not confirmed to be operating with Russian sponsorship, but evidence suggests the Russian authorities were at least complicit.27 The unusual aspect of the attacks was that they lasted for several weeks and had a very high intensity. Some of the botnets used in the DDOS attacks included up to 100,000 zombie computers. The commandeered computers directed large amounts of data at Estonia's government websites and banking system.28 The US-NATO efforts stabilized the situation, but intermittent attacks continued until mid-May 2007.29 In response to the cyber attacks, NATO established the Cooperative Defense Center in Estonia in May 2008. The center is staffed by 30 cyber specialists and is part of NATO's network of Centers of Excellence accredited to train representatives from member states about technical aspects of NATO operations.30 However, the new center's vulnerability was shown with the capture of Herman Simm in September 2008, which also further implicated Russia in the cyber attack on Estonia.31 Herman Simm, 61, was a high ranking official working in the Estonian Ministry of Defense. In 2001, he was appointed head of the State Secret Protection Office. He also developed the information protection systems for NATO and the European Union, frequently leading Estonian talks on protecting classified data. He was described as being “at the cutting edge of NATO's most important new strategic missions: to defend the alliance against cyber-attack.”32 Recruited as an asset by Russia in the late 1980s, he was accused of providing classified U.S. missile shield and cyber defense information to the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service for millions of dollars. The Estonian government issued Simm CYBER WARFARE SPRING 2012 a diplomatic passport that he used to personally transfer documents abroad.³³ Although it is unknown if he had other accomplices within the government, Simm oversaw the issuance of security clearances for Estonian intelligence, military, and security agencies.³⁴ An Estonian court convicted Simm of treason in February 2009. He was ordered to pay $1.6 million and sentenced to 12 years in prison for damage to security systems.³⁵ In November 2008, the United States DOD computers were subject to a retaliatory cyber attack thought to originate in Russia.³⁶ The attack spread throughout the computer network via agent.btz malware, which was designed specifically to target military computers. The malware damaged computer networks in U.S. Central Command, including computers used in Iraq and Afghanistan. The attack also penetrated another highly classified DOD network.³⁷ The Pentagon banned all use of flash drives, which was believed to be the method of delivering the malware to the computer network. Several intelligence sources say evidence indicates Russian government involvement, which if correct, would make it the first time a major cyber power successfully invaded classified U.S. military networks.³⁸ In April 2009, NATO expelled two Russians. One was the son of Vladimir Chizhov, the Russian ambassador to the European Union.³⁹ He and the other diplomat were assigned to Russia's mission to NATO and were suspected of working undercover as spies. The computer systems of NATO and the DOD have since been upgraded with\"enhanced security measures.\"⁴⁰ # RUSSIA-GEORGIA WAR The Russia-Georgia War of 2008 may be the first instance of the use of hybrid warfare in which a cyber attack preceded a conventional military strike. Despite the Russian government's denial of involvement in the cyber attack, the planning, servers of Russian state-owned businesses, and timing of the attack suggest some degree of coordination or direction by the Russian government.⁴¹ The cyber attack began with a series of small-scale DDOS attacks in June 2008, two months prior to the five-day war over the breakaway region of South Ossetia.⁴² The cyber attacks made use of botnets, which loaded computers with malicious software. The hackers then ordered the zombie computers to send millions of requests to designated websites to overwhelm the server causing it to shut down. On July 20, several DDOS attacks on President Mikhail Saakashvili's official website caused it to shut down for over 24 hours.⁴³ Reports indicated that the cyber attack came from a\"command-and-control server\"set up several weeks earlier in the United States, which shows that planning and coordination are not confined to national borders.⁴⁴ The U.S.-based server became operational many weeks ahead of the actual attacks, and by August 8, the first day of the war, the rate of cyber attacks had escalated to a very high level. Six botnets launched a coordinated cyber attack on Georgian government and media websites.⁴⁵ The cyber attacks also increased in intensity along with the physical conflict between Russian and Georgian troops. The websites of the President, Parliament, Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the National Bank of Georgia, and the online news agencies of The Messenger and Civil.ge all shut down. The websites of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the LBJ JOURNAL OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS National Bank were defaced by adding images comparing Saakashvili with Adolf Hitler.46 Although defacing a government website has a visual impact, shutting down online media sources during a military attack is characteristic of information warfare with the intent to disrupt communication and prevent dissemination of accurate information.\nThe Georgian government reacted by requesting permission from Google to transfer the websites of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Civil.ge to the Blogspot domain, which were better protected from the DDOS attacks.47 Atlanta-based Tulip Systems, Inc. agreed to host the President's website. Polish President Lech Kacyznski provided space on his website for official Georgian press releases, and Estonia hosted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and sent two information security specialists to support Georgian cyber defenses.48 Reports indicated that StopGeorgia.ru, which was established within hours of Russian forces entering South Ossetia, was a main coordinator of the cyber attacks.49 The forum provided a continuously updated list of target websites. It also encouraged visitors to download DoSHTTP, a free software program, to allow them to participate in the DDOS attacks.50 Project Grey Goose, an independent project launched by cyber specialist Jeff Carr and 100 computer security, technology, and intelligence volunteers, attempted to determine the source of the cyber attacks. Although, the group was unable to verify Russian-sponsorship of StopGeorgia.ru and another website, Xakep.ru, it is still reasonable to conclude a link exists. Russian government members clearly supported the sites' efforts and their implied consent by refusing to take action against the sites to stop the cyber attacks.51 Project Grey Goose also found that the hackers made extensive use of SQL attacks, which are simpler than DDOS attacks. The SQL attacks exploit vulnerabilities within MySQL, a popular open source software which websites commonly use to manage databases. The targeted database is overwhelmed with millions of extraneous queries, shutting down the server. The benefit of using a combined SQL and DDOS attack is that it is very difficult to detect.52 SQL attacks also do not require as many computers to have the same impact as a DDOS attack that cannot be kept up without botnets. The methods used showed “planning, organization, targeted reconnaissance, and evolution of attacks.”53 The cyber attacks on Georgia in 2008 did not cause nearly the damage that they did in Estonia in 2007 because Georgia's economy and infrastructure are not fully integrated to the Internet—only 7 percent of the country has access to the Internet, with only limited coverage outside Tiblisi.54 Nevertheless, the attacks disrupted timely dissemination of information by the Georgian government and forced it to seek alternative methods for distributing information to the international community.\n### China and Cyber Attacks China is a main threat to cyber security because of the large number of Internet users and because of the high number of attacks originating in the country that are more sophisticated than other actors.55 China also regards cyber warfare as CYBER WARFARE SPRING 2012 a central component in future conflicts, such as with the United States, where a direct confrontation would be difficult.56 This is an example of asymmetric warfare, where one actor, a country or non-state entity, undermines another country's strength by exploiting its weaknesses.57 Asymmetric conflict involves a tactical operation whose objective is to prevent the opponent from engaging in battle. This vision makes sense from China's perspective because it must counter the United States' technological advantage. Cyber attacks from China are not new. China launched cyber attacks in response to U.S. planes bombing the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, and following the crash of a Chinese fighter after it collided with a U.S. surveillance plane. In 2002, U.S. government servers were the target of coordinated cyber attacks, code-named Titan Rain, which originated in China.58 Targeted locations included the U.S. Army Information Systems Engineering Command, the Naval Ocean Systems Center, the Missile Defense Agency, and Sandia National Laboratories. China downloaded between 10 and 20 terabytes of data, or roughly the amount of information contained in the entire Library of Congress. The cyber attacks sought to gain information about military and government activities. China also conducted reconnaissance of the U.S. command and control system, information that it could use in future cyber attacks.59 In addition to the United States, China has targeted other Western nations. The German Vice President of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution, Hans Elmar Remberg, accused China of carrying out computer network intrusions on an\"almost daily\"basis.60 French Secretary-General of National Defense Francis Delon confirmed that the Chinese had targeted many French government websites in September 2007.61 In November 2007, MI-5 Director Jonathan Evans warned financial service companies that they were the targets of\"state-sponsored computer network exploitation.\"62 In the cyber attacks on the British financial system, the Chinese hackers were suspected of successfully obtaining strategic plans and risk management systems of Lehman brothers, Britain's Bradford &amp; Bingley, and Iceland's Landsbanki.63 Chinese hackers associated with the People's Liberation Army (PLA) carried out an attack on Pentagon computer networks that lasted for several weeks in 2007.64 The cyber attacks overpowered the defenses mounted by U.S. military computer experts. The cyber attacks overpowered the defenses mounted by U.S. military computer experts. The Chinese hackers gained accessed to the unclassified computer system that supports the Secretary of Defense. To avoid further damage, the Pentagon shut down the network.65 The cyber attack resulted in the creation of the National Cyber Investigative Joint Task Force to\"coordinate, integrate, and share information related to all domestic cyber threat investigations.\"66 By 2005, the Chinese PLA had formed\"information warfare militia units\"charged with developing viruses to attack enemy computer systems and networks.67 There are thought to be about 250 hacker groups in China that are either tolerated or encouraged by the government.68 One such group was the Network Crack Program Hacker (NCPH) that had ties to the PLA. NCPH developed software that allowed remote control of network programs, enabling the organization to steal government documents. NCPH also took advantage of holes in Microsoft Of LBJ JOURNAL OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS VOL. 20 CYBER WARFARE China is interested in aggressively acquiring commercial secrets and information on future weapons systems.⁷¹ The closed and authoritarian nature of the Chinese state and its tight regulation of the Internet make it tough to imagine large hacker communities operating freely without state supervision. The lack of transparency regarding Chinese military modernization and yearly increases in military expenditures is a main concern for the Pentagon. Chinese use of cyber warfare is becoming increasingly sophisticated. Although, the Chinese space program is focused mostly on civilian uses, it is providing the PLA with the ability to track U.S. forces in the western Pacific Ocean. China's advances in cyber technology will jeopardize the U.S. military communication systems that depend on wireless communications and computer networks.⁷² In addition, China is targeting defense contractors, such as Raytheon, Lockheed Martin, Boeing, and Northrop Grumman, all of which have had their unclassified networks penetrated by Chinese hackers. In 2005, Chinese hackers were able to obtain the Army's and Air Force's flight planning software from Redstone Arsenal, Alabama.⁷³ Furthermore, Chinese operations have been detected inside certain U.S. electricity grids. The Chinese have the capability to map electric networks and leave behind malicious software to sabotage networks later. Former DNI McConnell stated he would be surprised if tools and capabilities have not been left in computer and information systems that could be put into action at some time in the future.⁷⁴ Current waves of cyber attacks from China are aimed mainly at collecting information and probing defenses. China is likely to continue to exploit U.S. dependence on cyberspace because of low operations costs compared to traditional espionage methods or military activities. Cyber attacks create confusion, and there is no legal framework for cyber warfare.⁷⁵ An international legal framework provides a basis for deterring cyber attacks by creating a cost and international pressure for violating an accepted norm.⁷⁶ ## A CYBER ARMS RACE The cyber attacks being detected today and the use of hybrid warfare in the Russia-Georgia War are the beginning of a new international race to develop cyber weapons and the defenses to protect against them. As the Internet spreads to ever more distant parts of the world, and national economies become increasingly LBJ JOURNAL OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS CYBER WARFARE SPRING 2012 integrated into the World Wide Web, the desire to acquire both offensive and defensive cyber capabilities by states and non-state actors will multiply. China is an advanced technology products exporting power and a leader in the semiconductor industry, which gives it unique access to technology components.77 This access also provides a potential opening for launching cyber attacks.78 If an imminent attack was detected, some officials argue that the United States should pre-emptively strike the source, ranging from an online attack to a physical strike, as a means to deter future cyber attacks.79 Other officials argue that pre-emptive attacks would provide justification for foreign governments to invest in their own efforts to engage in cyber warfare and to pre-emptively attack the United States.80 With the numbers of hackers and the superior computing ability that comes from harnessing tens of thousands of computers around the world in botnets, someone will find a way to breach a network security system. In the long run, it is not possible to simply build more advanced cyber defenses. The best defense against a cyber attack is to develop a robust capability to engage in cyber war and develop the necessary defenses to mitigate a cyber attack.\nThe benefit of Eligible Receiver in the early days of cyber attacks is that federal agencies, research groups, and military contractors now frequently run war games to assess U.S. vulnerabilities. Although President Obama has not spoken openly about whether he supports or opposes cyber weapons, it would be irresponsible not to develop them to protect against attacks. These capabilities are also critical because they can provide vital intelligence, and foreign intelligence services are already using such capabilities, or investing heavily in developing them. U.S. intelligence agencies could activate code embedded in computer chips during the manufacturing process that would enable the U.S. to remotely control an enemy's computers over the Internet. However, the U.S. potentially runs the same risk from computer chips made in China.\nCurrently, there is no broad authorization for American forces to engage in cyber war. Former President Bush attempted to include a section to improve U.S. cyber defenses in a classified set of presidential orders in January 2008, but the administration failed to agree on how to write the authorization.81 Instead, President Bush authorized individual uses of cyber warfare in Iraq and Iran.82 In 2003, the Pentagon and U.S. intelligence agencies made plans for a cyber attack on Saddam Hussein's bank accounts. The plan would have frozen billions of dollars and crippled the Iraqi government's financial system in advance of the U.S. invasion of Iraq. Saddam Hussein would have had no money for war supplies or money to pay troops.83 Bush administration officials were concerned that the plan might not be limited to Iraq, potentially causing global financial disorder, spreading throughout the Middle East to Europe, and to the United States. Therefore, the plan was never carried out. However, President Bush did approve a plan to disable Iraq's military and government communications.84 The U.S. government contacted international communications companies that provided satellite and cell phone coverage in Iraq to warn them about jamming and to request support by turning off their signals. The communications jamming did affect surrounding countries that shared communication systems with Iraq, but the damage was considered LBJ JOURNAL OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS VOL. 20 CYBER WARFARE\n\n## DISCUSSION\nPresident Obama expanded a $17 billion, five-year program, known as the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative, authorized by President Bush in 2008.⁸⁶ In December 2009, President Obama appointed Howard Schmidt to fill the White House cyber security coordinator, after Melissa Hathaway resigned in August 2009, citing delays in the appointment process.⁸⁷ Secretary Robert Gates approved the creation of the U.S. Cyber Command (USCYBERCOMM) headed by the director of the National Security Agency, to be the nation's central hub for cyber capabilities. USCYBERCOMM incorporates the Joint Task Force-Global Network Operations (JTF-GNO) and the Joint Functional Component Command-Network Warfare (JFCC-NW). The organization will build the defenses for military computers and communications systems as well as developing and deploying cyber weapons.⁸⁸ The Pentagon has already commissioned military contractors to develop a classified version of the future Internet, known as the National Cyber Range, on which to test simulated cyber attacks to improve U.S. defenses.⁸⁹\nIt is clear the rapid dissemination of information and technology will only magnify the threat of cyber warfare in years to come. The Russian-based attacks on Estonia and Georgia showed how cyber attacks defy state borders and raise difficult issues of jurisdiction. It also shows Russia's preference of using cyber attacks to settle scores with former Soviet states. In addition, China is exhibiting a keen interest in industrial espionage and aggressive intelligence gathering through cyber attacks against Western governments. In April 2011, President Obama announced the National Strategy for Trusted Identities in Cyberspace as a means to increase trustworthiness of identities in online transactions in response to fraud and identity thefts.⁹⁰ The U.S. will have to spearhead the formation of a legal framework for this new challenge, complete with definition of vital terms and rules of the game. The main tenets of warfare embedded in the UN Geneva Conventions will have to be revised to incorporate cyber warfare because it blurs the principles of proportionality, neutrality, and distinction. Yet the most serious problem of cyber warfare is that countries do not know how good the weapons are until they are used.\n## ENDNOTES\n\nLBJ JOURNAL OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS CYBER WARFARE SPRING 2012\n\nLBJ JOURNAL OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS VOL. 20 CYBER WARFARE\n\nLBJ JOURNAL OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS CYBER WARFARE SPRING 2012\n\nLBJ JOURNAL OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS VOL. 20 CYBER WARFARE\n\nLBJ JOURNAL OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS CYBER WARFARE SPRING 2012\n\nLBJ JOURNAL OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS VOL. 20 CYBER WARFARE 39"
