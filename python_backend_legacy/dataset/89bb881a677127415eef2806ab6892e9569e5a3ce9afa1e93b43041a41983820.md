En exploitant la fascination des électeurs pour le cyberconflit, les dirigeants peuvent désormais désamorcer les crises en toute sécurité, sans avoir à craindre une censure nationale. Tel est l'attrait du cyberpouvoir chez le grand public que même des cyberattaques mineures, aux conséquences opérationnelles faibles, peuvent apaiser l'attente d'une puissante force militaire chez les électeurs. En pratique, cela signifie que les dirigeants qui seraient sinon tenus par des coûts d'audience nationaux peuvent y « échapper » en menant des cyberattaques à l'efficacité superficielle, mais suffisante pour les électeurs nationaux. Pour explorer la modération des pressions d'escalade nationales grâce aux cyberopérations, je mène une expérience de sondage qui demande aux participants d'évaluer les qualités de dirigeant de leur président après le déploiement d'une cyberforce ou d'une force conventionnelle. Les résultats confirment que le public considère les cyberattaques, même si elles sont éphémères et exemptes de conséquences, comme étant suffisamment vigoureuses pour répondre aux menaces de recours à la force d'un dirigeant et apaiser ses envies d'actions militaires. En proposant des exemples concrets de cette théorie dans de nombreux incidents du monde réels, je démontre que l'enthousiasme du public pour le cyberpouvoir ajoute une toute nouvelle flexibilité à la prise de décisions par temps de crise.\n## Introduction\nVoters are enthralled by cyber power. In the eyes of the public, cyber power is an almighty technological weapon that can pierce through enemy defenses — leaving a trail of destruction in its inscrutable wake (Shandler, Gross, and Canetti 2021). Cyberattacks arouse severe anxiety when turned against us (Backhaus et al. 2020), and they foster keen enthusiasm when used against our adversaries (Leal and Musgrave 2023). These beliefs about cyber power are, of course, steeped in hyperbole — yet they are earnestly held by a credulous public who are buffeted by a constant din of sensationalist media reporting of cyber doom narratives (Makridis, Maschmeyer, and Smeets 2024; Lawson 2019). The disjoint between perception and reality presents political leaders with an opportunity to appear strong without taking strong action. Applying a framework of domestic audience\ncosts (Fearon 1994), I demonstrate how the allure of cyber power allows leaders to back down from explicit threats without suffering domestic censure. This finding reimagines the logic of audience costs for a digital age.\nDomestic politics and public opinion are integral features of many modern theories of international conflict (Kertzer 2023, 2018). Democratic leaders pay keen attention to voters' attitudes toward war, with public opinion capable of acting as a constraint on escalation (Baum and Potter 2015; Gelpi 2017), or a spur that pushes leaders to retaliate (Ribar 2021; Dafoe et al. 2022). When it comes to cyber power, it was once thought that public engagement with cyberattacks would manifest in the latter category — adding escalatory momentum to conflict situations. So the thinking went, widespread exposure to frightening cyberattacks would lead to mass demands for retaliation, generating escalatory tailwinds and encouraging leaders to respond with any means necessary (Leal and Musgrave 2023; Shandler, Gross, and Canetti 2022). Yet the reality turned out to be far more muted. The ambiguity and uncertainty associated with cyber threats undercut public support for retaliation (Jardine, Porter, and Shandler 2024), and predominantly subversive cyber operations failed to evoke the level of destructiveness that would generate domestic political pressure to engage in military action (Maschmeyer 2021, 2023).\nThis article reimagines the effect of voters' captivation with cyber power, arguing that it acts as a check on conflict escalation by adding flexibility to crisis decision making. By exploiting the public enthusiasm for cyber force, leaders can safely de-escalate crisis situations without worrying about suffering domestic censure (Lonergan and Lonergan 2022). I argue that when states conduct cyber operations, the domestic public are likely to view the use of cyberattacks as a strong sign of resolve — even if the effectiveness of the cyberattack is objectively limited. Essentially, cyber power enables leaders to de-escalate conflict without having to worry about suffering domestic censure for acting weakly or inconsistently on the international stage.\nUnderstanding the interplay between public opinion and cyber conflict requires that we descend from an international level of analysis, where most escalation debates play out, to an individual level of analysis grounded in political psychology and lay perceptions. In answering why low-cost, non-destructive cyber operations would ever be sufficient to placate hawkish domestic audiences (Yoder 2022) — the answer lies not in theories of signaling or compellence, but in theories of public opinion. Interpreting the impact of public opinion on foreign affairs requires that we interrogate the psychological and cognitive dimensions of cyber conflict, not its strategic impact.\nTo test whether cyber operations can truly temper domestic escalatory pressures, I conduct a survey experiment with a sample of American voters that asks participants to evaluate presidential leadership following the\ndeployment of cyber or conventional force. The experimental findings confirm that the public view cyberattacks — even ephemeral, inconsequential cyberattacks — as sufficiently forceful to meet a leader's threat of force and placate any public zeal for vengeance. I further verify that the results transcend partisan affiliation and recur at all levels of technological literacy.\nThese findings demonstrate how public perceptions of cyber power adds newfound flexibility to crisis decision making. By exploiting the public enthusiasm for cyber force, leaders can safely de-escalate crisis situations while maintaining a seemingly muscular foreign policy posture in the eyes of their domestic constituents. In the subsequent sections, I begin by laying out the foundations of public attitudes toward cyber conflict. After introducing the conceptual foundation, I present a novel experimental design and a set of results that verify the theory using the well-worn technique of audience-cost experiments. Last, I discuss the implications of the findings, and offer examples of how this theory has played out in real world incidents.\n## Voters' Perceptions of Cyber Power—A Terrifyingly Effective Domain\nPerceptions of cyber power are rooted in fear and emotions (Shandler, Snider, et al. 2022). A growing set of experimental works has demonstrated that voters experience mental anguish in the aftermath of cyberattacks. Exposure to even benign cyberattacks triggers spikes in stress and anxiety (Backhaus et al. 2020), threat perception (Snider et al. 2021; Gross et al. 2017), anger (Shandler, Gross, and Canetti 2022), dread (Gomez and Villar 2018; Shandler and Gomez 2023), and a willingness to sacrifice civil liberties to protect against future attacks (Snider et al. 2025; Snider et al. 2021).\nThis inflated sense of threat among the public is driven by several features that are specific to cyberspace. The anonymity and mystique that are commonly associated with cyberspace exacerbate negative psychological responses, with unknown and seemingly omniscient perpetrators creating an environment of panic and helplessness (Dunn Cavelty 2012; Hansen and Nissenbaum 2009; Gomez and Whyte 2021). Moreover, the public's lack of technical sophistication when it comes to cyber threats ferments feelings of dread, a trend that is magnified by the constant exposure to seemingly irrepressible cyberattacks on a growing array of devices (Gomez and Villar 2018; Bada and Nurse 2020; McDermott 2019).\nMuch of the hyperbolic views of omnipotent and destructive cyber actors can be traced to sensationalized media coverage and popular culture depictions of cyber power (Lawson 2019; Dunn Cavelty 2019). This dramatized coverage has come to be known as the “cyber doom narrative,” a teleological expectation that digital insecurity will inevitably result in mass societal collapse as our growing dependence on digital systems renders us vulnerable\nto attacks (Gomez and Whyte 2021; Hansen and Nissenbaum 2009). Having been emotionally primed to experience dread, anxiety, and helplessness in the face of cyberattacks, it is no wonder that the public is liable to buy into the pervasive cultural narrative surrounding cyber threats. As a case in point, a field study of a mundane ransomware attack against a hospital in Germany revealed intense public anxiety, and a steep fall in voters' trust in their government, despite authorities' attempts to calm the jittery residents (Shandler and Gomez 2023; Gomez and Shandler 2024).\nWhile the public has developed a deep trepidation towards the destructive potential of cyber threats, it has, by the same logic, warmly embraced cyberattacks as an effective military offensive option. A series of experiments across multiple countries has observed a consistently high level of public enthusiasm for employing cyberattacks to respond to national security threats (Leal and Musgrave 2023). Voters are enthused by the perceived capacity of cyberattacks as an operationally effective attack option that avoids placing troops in harm's way and which minimizes civilian casualties (Demarest, Jost, and Schub 2024). Even in response to the most egregious and deadly attacks, the public views cyberattacks as being a highly effective and appropriate retaliatory option (Gross, Canetti, and Vashdi 2017; Jardine et al. 2024).\nPublic beliefs about cyber power are made salient by the fact that cyber operations are now widely publicized. In the past, cyber operations were famous for taking place under a cloak of anonymity. Yet in recent years, there has been a distinct trend towards public disclosure of cyberattacks wherein authorities willingly publicize what were once secretive cyber operations (Baram 2023; Baram 2022; Poznansky and Perkoski 2018; Egloff and Smeets 2023). Leaders opt to openly divulge cyber operations to signal strength and prestige to external audiences (Egloff and Smeets 2023; Smeets and Lin 2018), to legitimize investments in the cyber domain (Jacobsen and Ringsmose 2017), and to undermine rivals' trust in technology infrastructure (Jacobsen and Ringsmose 2017). This article reinforces an additional rationale for self-attribution, which is signaling strength and resolve to domestic audiences who are galvanized by displays of military force in general, and cyber-force in particular (Shandler et al. 2021).\nIt would be understandable at this point for readers to protest that: public perceptions about cyber power are simply incorrect. I agree - public beliefs about cyber power do not necessarily match its constrained reality. Among military officials and cyber experts, the prevailing view holds that cyber power is incapable of independently effecting strategic outcomes, and that it is primarily effective as a force amplifier in coordination with conventional military forces (Valeriano, Jensen, and Maness 2018), or as an act of sub-crisis maneuvering that operates below the threshold of conflict (Maschmeyer 2021; Maschmeyer 2023; Valeriano and Maness 2014;\ncf. Demarest, Jost, and Schub 2024). Nevertheless, the disjoint between public perceptions of cyber strength and the reality of its constrained effectiveness is precisely the phenomenon that creates a strategic opportunity for leaders to overcome domestic escalatory pressure.\nSpecifically, this paper targets two gaps in the cyber conflict literature that remain understudied. Much of the existing research on cyber power is dedicated to scrutinizing the objective effects and effectiveness of cyber operations. However, it is imperative that we also recognize the impact of (oftentimes distorted) perceptions about cyber power. Beliefs about cyber capabilities, even if untethered from reality, shape behavior and decision-making in real ways. Additionally, the accumulating research on public opinion and cyber power must take a final step to interrogate the strategic impact of public attitudes and beliefs. To date, mounting empirical research has demonstrated that cyberattacks roil public beliefs about international affairs and arouse strong emotional reactions (Shandler and Canetti 2024). The missing step is to connect these public responses to concrete political outcomes to make the case of why public opinion matters. In the next section, we take this leap by interpreting public opinion through the prism of domestic audience costs.\n## Interpreting Cyber Operations Through the Lens of Audience Costs\nTo briefly revisit the main tenets of audience cost theory, governments manufacture domestic audience costs to credibly communicate resolve to actors in the international arena. By publicly threatening to employ military force, leaders add credibility to their signals, since both parties to the conflict are aware that domestic constituencies punish governments that say one thing and do another (Fearon 1994; Smith 1998; Baum 2004; Slantchev 2006; Weeks 2008). The presence of audience costs transforms public threats from cheap talk into informative signals. According to the basic precepts of this theory, when a rival refuses to accede to a threat underpinned by audience costs, a leader has two principal options: to follow through on the threat and so escalate the conflict, or to back down from the threat and suffer domestic censure.\nCyber operations challenge this basic theory. What if there was an option for leaders to publicly issue a threat (an ostensibly costly signal), and yet avoid the imposition of audience costs were they to back down? I argue that cyberattacks can strike this delicate balance. To the domestic audience, wielding cyber power sends a message of strength since the public holds clear (if exaggerated) beliefs about the value and effectiveness of cyber power. Importantly, this domestically targeted message of strength is untethered to the operational effects produced by cyberattacks. As such, even minor cyberattacks with little operational or escalatory impact can placate voters' expectation of “strong” military resolve.\nINTERNATIONAL INTERACTIONS\n#\nIn Figure 1, I visualize an updated crisis bargaining model that newly incorporates cyberattacks as a distinct military option. The figure reimagines the traditional decision tree associated with audience cost theories, with the addition of a new option (D) depicted in blue. The scenario depicts a crisis between two players — who we can think of as a country (1) and a foreign rival (2). The game progresses with the country deciding at the first phase whether to publicly threaten the use of force against the foreign rival in attempt to achieve a strategic objective. If the country refrains from making any threat — then the scenario ends with them having decided to (A) stay out of the crisis. If the country issues a threat, and the foreign rival does not concede, then the onus moves back to the country to decide whether to (B) back down from their threat, or (C) follow through on their threat. Audience cost models are principally\nFigure 1. Updated crisis bargaining model with new cyberattack option.\nNote: The figure reflects the crisis scenario with expected domestic and strategic payoffs for player 1 presented under each terminal node. Ticks reflect the optimal outcomes, with no audience costs being preferred to the sufferance of audience costs, and de-escalation being preferred to military escalation. Only decision (D) leads to a situation where no audience costs are suffered and the crisis is de-escalated.\n|   | (B) Backs Down | (C) Follows Through | (D) Cyber Attack  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  Domestic Audience Cost: | Suffers Audience Cost | No Audience Cost | No Audience Cost  |\n|  Crisis Outcome: | De-Escalation | Military Escalation | De-Escalation  |\nconcerned with the difference between staying out and backing down, since publics demonstrably punish leaders who renege on their commitments.\nUntil now, these first options reflect the typical crisis bargaining model. Each of options (B) and (C) yields a negative consequence. By backing down from a threat, a government can refrain from unwanted military escalation, but will suffer a drop in public approval as their domestic constituents punish them for acting inconsistently and weakly (Kertzer and Brutger 2016). Alternatively, by following through and engaging in military action, a government can avoid domestic denunciation, but must prepare for a military conflagration whose consequences are unknown. We now add an additional avenue of action (D) — which depicts a government decision to conduct a cyberattack.\nBased on the above analysis describing how voters perceive cyber power, we can expect that employing a cyberattack allows the government player to mitigate any negative consequences — epitomizing a digital get out jail free card. The evidence suggests that cyber operations conducted in isolation are not a replacement for conventional warfare (Kostyuk and Gartzke 2022), and they are unlikely to engender escalatory consequences (Jensen, Valeriano, and Whitt 2024; Lin-Greenberg 2023; Libicki 2020; Fischerkeller and Harknett 2017). Yet from the perspective of the public, the cyberattack would be viewed as an act of force and a clear expression of intent. Seeing as the public view cyberspace as an effective operational domain, comparable to air and land power, launching a cyberattack meets the initial promise of force and allays any modicum of inconsistency that would give rise to audience costs. The country's leader, in this scenario, has the best of both worlds — they have backed down from a potentially escalatory conflict situation while avoiding domestic political consequences.\nAdmittedly, this logical chain of events represents just one scenario in which offensive cyber operations might be used in conflict settings. Nevertheless, this model of crisis bargaining has served to theorize about leader's decision making for decades, and there is value in overlaying cyber operations on a well-formed model of international relations. Our central focus of interest is whether benign cyber operations can effectively send signals of strength to domestic audiences. On this basis, I put forward the following testable hypothesis: cyberattacks, even those with limited operational effects, will be interpreted as a signal of strength and an effective projection of force by domestic audiences.\n## Experimental Methodology\nTo test the above theoretical framework, I employ a well-trodden pathway for experimentally examining audience costs that relies on original survey\nINTERNATIONAL INTERACTIONS\n#\nexperiments. Since Tomz (2007) first introduced a technique to empirically scrutinize the phenomenon, a series of subsequent experiments have corroborated its veracity and successfully replicated and extended the inherent logic of audience costs (Hoffman et al. 2009; Trager and Vavreck 2011; Levendusky and Horowitz 2012; Davies and Johns 2013; Chaudoin 2014; Kertzer and Brutger 2016; Lin-Greenberg 2019). This experimental approach has proven popular because selection biases mean that audience costs are difficulty to study through observational data. $^{1}$\nThe experimental design involved fielding an online survey experiment in March 2021 on a national sample of 960 Americans recruited using the Prolific Survey Panel. The study respondents represented a cross-section of the general population (mean age = 35 years, SD = 12.9). The sample's political orientation leans slightly to the left, with 56% of respondents self-identifying as progressive, while the gender distribution is exactly 50% male and female. Since the purpose of the study is to challenge the conventional logic of audience costs, the structure of the experiment draws heavily from the setup introduced in Tomz's (2007) audience cost study, which has been subject to extensive corroboration and replication. All research design and hypotheses were pre-registered prior to data collection.\nTo begin, all respondents were introduced to a scenario according to which \"a foreign country sent its military to take over a territorial region of its neighboring country.\" Respondents were then randomly assigned to one of five treatment conditions (see Table 1) that varied whether or not the U.S. president threatened to intervene and use force, and whether the president followed through on the threat in one way or another. In the stay out condition, which acts as a control group, the president pledges to stay out of the conflict, and indeed refrains from engaging in any conflict. In the other four treatment groups, respondents are told that \"the U.S. president declared that if the attacking country continues to invade, the U.S. military would immediately engage and attempt to push out the\n$^{1}$ I acknowledge a resilient school of thought that casts doubt on the empirical validity and theoretical persuasiveness of the phenomenon. One group of critics claim that artificially constructed experimental scenarios lack ecological and external validity since leaders allegedly fail to issue explicit threats, (Snyder and Borghard 2011) or because fictional experiments overstate the costs that respondents impose on real leaders (Croco et al. 2021; Kurizaki and Whang 2015). Another group of critics posit that the absence of real-world crises with corresponding audience cost outcomes calls into question the external validity of this theory (Trachtenberg 2012; Gartzke and Lupu 2012). While conceding the need to carefully construct experimental techniques that mimic real-world scenarios, I suggest that real-world events needn't accord precisely with the phased layout of the experimental structure for us to learn valuable lessons.\n$^{2}$ While all online survey panels have a mixed reputation regarding the representativeness of their participant pools, research has shown that the Prolific panel is superior in terms of the comprehension, attention, and honesty of responses compared to other panels (Douglas, Ewell, and Brauer 2023; Eyal et al. 2021).\n$^{3}$ The research design was approved by the Research Ethics (IRB) Committee of the authors' institution (approval # 120/21).\n#\nR. SHANDLER\nTable 1. Description of treatment conditions.\n|  Treatment condition | N | Presidential threat / declaration | Implemented action  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  Stay out | 190 | The president declared that the U.S. would stay out of the conflict. | The U.S. refrained from engaging in the conflict.  |\n|  Back down | 210 | The president threatened that the U.S. military would engage and push out the attacking country | The U.S. backed down and did not engage the attacking country in any way.  |\n|  Engage militarily (Follow Through) | 175 | The president threatened that the U.S. military would engage and push out the attacking country | Deployed grounds troops against the attacking country  |\n|  Major (degradative) cyberattack | 181 | The president threatened that the U.S. military would engage and push out the attacking country | Major degradative cyberattack that crippled the attacking force's communication networks and rendered its radar system inoperable  |\n|  Minor (disruptive) cyberattack | 204 | The president threatened that the U.S. military would engage and push out the attacking country | Minor disruptive cyberattack that slowed the attacker's digital systems and publicized sensitive personnel files.  |\nattacking country.\" In each of these four conditions, the scenario continues with the president either backing down from the threat and abstaining from any military action (back down condition), deploying ground troops against the attacking country (engage militarily condition), employing major degradative cyberattacks that operationally cripple the attacking country's military forces (major cyberattack condition), or employing minor disruptive cyberattacks that cause temporary disruptions to the attacking country's digital systems (minor cyberattack condition). The full survey instruments appear in Online Appendix A, along with balance tables and treatment randomization checks.\nConsistent with other iterations of this experimental structure, I control for outcomes by ensuring that all treatment conditions lead to the same endpoint, with the hostile state gaining  $20\\%$  of the contested territory regardless of whether the President engages or stays out (Kertzer and Brutger 2016; Lin-Greenberg 2019). Likewise, seeing as domestic casualties are a central guiding factor in military approval, I control for this by ensuring that the United States experiences zero casualties in any scenario.4\nFollowing exposure to one of the conflict conditions, which was reinforced through a series of attention checks, I measured the dependent variable of interest by asking participants whether they approved or disapproved of the way the President handled the situation on a seven-point scale. Additionally, I collected data on respondents' dispositional\nINTERNATIONAL INTERACTIONS\n#\ncharacteristics such as militant assertiveness using a scale developed by Herrmann, Tetlock, and Visser (1999), international trust via a measured produced by Brewer (2004), and political ideology using the standard measure from the American National Election Studies. I further collected a comprehensive battery of demographic characteristics, including gender, employment, age, level of education, and technological literacy. Information on the scales and sources of all collected measures appears in the Online Appendix.\n# Results\nTo assess how use of force decisions give rise to audience costs, Figure 2 reveals the average treatment effect of each experimental condition on presidential approval. The average treatment effect consists of a regression coefficient estimate for each proxy treatment group when compared to the baseline \"Stay Out\" condition. $^{6}$  For this first analysis, I combine the two cyberattacks treatments into one overarching cyber group to construct a general cyber effect.\nA number of results immediately leap out. First, similarly to all audience cost experiments, we can see that the typical audience cost effect (conceptualized as the effect of backing down from a commitment compared to staying out of the conflict) is negative, large, and statistically significant  $(\\beta = -1.622, p &lt; .000)$ . This finding rehashes the central tenet of domestic audience costs, showing that voters will punish a leader for issuing a threat to use force and then backing down. Likewise, we can be encouraged by the fact that the level of support for engaging militarily (and not acting inconsistently) also acts as expected, with no statistically significant difference between military engagement and staying out of the conflict  $(\\beta = .151, p = \\mathrm{n.s.})$ . Essentially, voters are looking for consistency; they will not punish the president for evincing a desire to stay out of the conflict and doing so, nor will they punish the president for making a threat and following through. Only backing down from an explicit threat leads to domestic censure.\nWhen turning to our primary variable of interest, the effect of conducting cyberattacks, we can observe a slight but statistically significant increase in presidential approval following a cyberattack, compared to the\n6The full regression output appears in Online Appendix E.\n7The belligerence cost effect is necessarily smaller than the audience cost effect, since inconsistent behavior makes up the majority of an audience cost (Kertzer and Brutger 2016). The public applies a belligerence cost due to disapproval of aggressive behavior, even if it is consistent with past promises. In the presented results, engaging militarily did not lead to any statistically significant decrease in public approval. This is consistent with past findings by Lin-Greenberg (2019) and Croco, Hanmer, and McDonald (2021), and contrasts with Kertzer and Brutger (2016) who identified a slight but statistically significant belligerence cost.\n#\nR. SHANDLER\nFigure 2. Situational approval by experimental condition.\nNote: This plot depicts estimates of the treatment effect of each experimental condition on presidential approval relative to the stay out condition. Estimates are based on an OLS model with each condition inserted as a proxy. Bars represent  $95\\%$  confidence intervals and dots depict estimate means.\nbaseline stay out condition ( $\\beta = .360$ ,  $p &lt; .019$ ). According to our conceptualization of this treatment, cyberattacks constitute a repudiation of the initial promise, almost akin to backing down. The president had declared that the U.S. military would actively engage and push out the attacking country's forces. Yet far from actualizing this commitment, the president contented with a single barrage of cyberattacks against the attacking country's forces that merely publicized sensitive information or targeted its radar systems. Neither action represents a level of military engagement sufficient to \"push back the attacking forces,\" and the rival country would certainly view such an attack as a token and de-escalatory signal. Yet even though this path of action represents the kind of inconsistency that should evoke domestic disapproval — as with the back down condition — the public actually reports a slight increase in approval. As theorized, it appears that that a leader can back down from a threat without suffering domestic\ncensure simply by deploying militarily trivial cyber operations that appear forceful to domestic constituents.\nA fact that adds credibility to this reading of the results is the fact that the public keenly distinguishes between greater and lesser military action. Lin-Greenberg (2019) found that leaders who committed to full military action can partially mitigate audience costs by deploying lesser attack techniques such as air-strikes or sanctions. Lin-Greenberg's alternative attack options fell somewhere in between realizing the full-throated military threat and completely backing down — and the public was able to discern this important distinction leading to lowered but not entirely mitigated audience costs. Yet in the case of cyberattacks, we don't see merely reduced audience costs, we see an actual increase in approval ratings. The study respondents viewed the cyberattack as a kept promise, even though its effectiveness is objectively limited. This accords with research by Shandler, Gross, and Canetti (2021) who revealed a strong public enthusiasm for cyber warfare on the basis of its being perceived as an operationally effective military option that minimizes friendly and collateral deaths.\n### Breaking Down Cyberattacks—Degradative Versus Disruptive Strikes\nTo add additional nuance to the analyses, and to avoid the critique of earlier audience cost experiments that oversimplified the choices available to leaders, I break down cyberattacks into degradative (major) cyberattacks and disruptive (minor) cyberattacks. Disruptive cyber techniques differ from degradative attacks in the permanence, the destructiveness, and the operational effectiveness of the attack. We could expect that the rarer, and more degradative cyberattacks are far likelier to be construed by the public as meeting the leader's initial promise of “military engagement that pushes back the attackers' forces.” Disruptive cyberattacks, by contrast, should not even come close to meeting this promise and should be viewed as wholly equivalent to backing down.\nIn Figure 3, I again illustrate the average treatment effect for each experimental condition, though this time dividing the previously uniform cyberattacks into degradative and disruptive cyberattacks. Furthermore, I add an interaction effect to account for the respondents' level of technological literacy. This heterogeneous factor is crucial for the subsequent analysis since research has consistently shown that people's level of digital sophistication guides their perceptions of the efficacy of cyber threats and operations (Kostyuk & Wayne 2021; Gomez and Villar 2018).\n#\nR. SHANDLER\nFigure 3. Situational approval by experimental condition—conditional on technological literacy.\nNote: This plot depicts estimates of the treatment effect of each experimental condition on presidential approval relative to the stay out condition. Estimates are based on an OLS model with interaction effects between tech literacy and each proxy experimental condition. Bars represent  $95\\%$  confidence intervals and dots depict estimate means.\nFigure 3 reveals that no audience costs are levied for either degradative or disruptive attacks. In essence, the public perceives even minor cyberattacks that have no lasting operational benefits as meeting the commitment of leaders to \"push back an attacker.\" Critically, we can see that the wide-ranging approval of cyberattacks is not contingent on technological literacy. One would think that high-tech literacy respondents would be more aware of the limited effects produced by cyber operations and that this group would recognize that minor, disruptive cyber operations do not meet the promise of a strong military response — but even high-tech literacy respondents refrained from imposing audience costs on leaders who deployed cyberattacks in lieu of conventional force. Both technologically literate and illiterate respondents refrain from punishing a leader for employing cyber operations, granting presidential flexibility across the board.\nHeterogeneous Effects: Hawks and Doves\nAs a third analysis, I examine whether the cyber pathway of avoiding audience costs holds when viewed through the lens of political orientation. I take this step since studies have identified that the strength of audience costs is highly conditional upon political orientation (Kertzer and Brutger 2016). Kertzer and Brutger (2016) even found that hawks and doves apply audience costs for different reasons — with hawks primarily punishing inconsistency and doves punishing belligerence along with inconsistency.\nIn Figure 4, I once again illustrate the average treatment effect for each experimental condition, including an interaction effect to account for political orientation. Since we are dealing with foreign policy views, I use militant assertiveness to distinguish between hawkishness and dovishness, a measure that tests beliefs about the desirability and effectiveness of the use of force in foreign policy. This three-item scale, developed by Herrmann, Tetlock, and Visser (1999), is commonly used in experimental studies that focus on foreign policy attitudes rather than purely domestic political attitudes.\nThe results reveal that when it comes to backing down and engaging militarily, the participants act as expected. Doves apply a substantial audience cost that is made up of an inconsistency cost (49%) that censures the perceived inconsistency of the president's actions, and a belligerence cost (51%) that punishes the threats of force. Hawks, by contrast, apply a larger audience cost than doves, and this cost is made up entirely by the overwhelming aversion to the perceived inconsistency of the president's behavior (> 100%). Both hawks and doves impose audience costs, just for different reasons.\nBut how do these groups look upon the exercise of cyberattacks? Looking at Figure 4, we can see that both groups refrain from imposing any audience costs when leaders execute disruptive or degradative cyberattacks that depart from their initial promises. It appears that the use of cyberattacks moderates the extremities of the partisan divide over conducting military action. Looking at the “engage militarily” column, we can see that hawks reward leaders who engage in military action in accordance with their commitments, while doves punish leaders for their belligerence. Yet these extremes are visibly softened for both types of cyberattacks. Doves view the use of cyberattacks as less severe than conventional military engagements, and so the belligerence cost and the inconsistency cost disappear. Meanwhile, hawks are slightly less enamored of cyberattacks compared to conventional military attacks, but still find them to be sufficiently forceful to meet the initial promise and so avoid any semblance of inconsistency. Though there remain differences between these groups, cyberattacks demonstrate enormous promise in striking a middle ground that can assuage even the highly partisan perceptions of hawks and doves towards the use of force in conflict settings.\n#\nR.

Situational approval by experimental condition—conditional on militant assertiveness (Hawks vs. Doves).\nNote: This plot depicts estimates of the treatment effect of each experimental condition on presidential approval relative to the stay out condition. Estimates are based on an OLS model with interaction effects between tech literacy and each proxy experimental condition. Bars represent  $95\\%$  confidence intervals and dots depict estimate means.\n# Robustness Tests\nResearchers have critiqued the use of hypothetical presidential figures in international relations experiments on the basis that presidential evaluations are largely driven by partisan cues that are absent in fictitious vignettes (Croco et al. 2021). To test the robustness of the current results in face of this critique, the survey participants were asked, as the experiment continued, to view updated conflict scenarios that depicted President Biden and Iran as the relevant actors. The alternate dependent variables in this case asked about the level of approval of President Biden's handling of the situation and measured the named President's job approval. I analyze this alternative experimental structure in Online Appendix C, finding that the same results recur under both hypothetical and realistic character representations. The study findings are also robust when excluding participants who failed any of the attention checks that were administered following the experimental treatments.\nDiscussion\nThis article proposes that the emergence of cyber capabilities has altered the nature of domestic audience costs. By taking advantage of voters' captivation with cyber power, and their understandable if erroneous belief in the operational effectiveness of cyber capabilities, leaders can back down from international threats while still appearing strong in the eyes of domestic constituents. I verify this theory through a novel experimental design, which confirms that the public views even minor cyberattacks — an objective signal of restraint — as sufficiently forceful to meet a leader's threat of force and avoid any semblance of inconsistency.\nEven with a well-founded theory backed up by robust experimental evidence, we must be careful when generalizing controlled experimental results to real-world events. Voters don't evaluate presidential performance in the artificial environment of survey experiments, and military conflict rarely abides by such clearly delineated phases of threats and responses as laid out in simplified experimental scenarios (Gartzke and Lupu 2012). Therefore, it behooves us to look for real-world examples of cyber audience costs that can corroborate the theory. Even if we cannot isolate specific causal mechanisms when examining historical events, it would be highly suggestive were we to find corroborating examples where minor cyberattacks were advertised as demonstrations of strength to domestic audiences, even while they were objectively used to walk back threats of escalation. I offer two cases where this behavior can be partly observed.\nA first real-world example occurred on June 20, 2019, when Iran shot down a U.S. R1-4 Global Hawk UAV (Newman 2019). President Trump immediately and publicly threatened massive retaliatory military strikes against targets inside Iran, claiming that Iran faced “obliteration” for their acts. The threat was ignored by Iranian authorities who insisted that they would continue to shoot down any U.S. assets that entered Iranian airspace (Pickrell 2019). Yet even after publicly issuing a threat, President Trump backed down from the initial threat, sufficing with a series of cyberattacks that disabled Iran's ability to track ships in the region and compromised Iran's missile defense systems (Valeriano and Jensen 2022).\nFrom every possible angle, it is indisputable that President Trump walked back his initial threat, setting in place the precise conditions that should give rise to critical domestic censure and generate inconsistency costs. In lieu of the promised “obliteration,” the American response de-escalated the situation by conducting a relatively minor cyberattack that signaled restraint. The cyberattack was effectively used as an off-ramp to avoid a dangerous escalation of hostilities (Valeriano and Jensen 2022), and indeed this cycle of hostilities came to an end.\nYet to the domestic public, the restrained cyberattack was not viewed as a capitulation. Even though the attack objectively failed to meet the severity of the initial promise to “obliterate” Iran, the cyberattack was still viewed as a signal of strength and resolve. Comparing polls taken immediately prior and following the incident, President Trump suffered no situational disapproval or lowered confidence in voters' perceptions of his ability to handle the situation in Iran (Pew Research Center 2019). In fact, the Trump administration may have exploited the secrecy that is inherently connected with cyber operations to inflate voters' beliefs about the attack's impact (Baram 2023, 2022). By emphasizing the covertness of the attack and the ambiguity associated with the effects, media coverage of the incident likely inflated public perceptions about the severity of the muted cyberattack.\nA similar scenario played out in Israel one year later. During April 2020, Iranian hackers infiltrated the systems of an Israeli water plant (Times of Israel 2020). The hackers sought to cripple computer systems that controlled water flow and raise the level of chlorine within the water mix that was distributed to Israeli homes. The incident was thwarted before it could cause major damage, though it sent shivers down the country's spine. Israeli citizens were baying for blood, and Israeli leadership declared that the targeting of civilian infrastructure was a “red line” that warranted swift, decisive, and massive retaliation.\nYet massive retaliation did not arrive. Instead, Israel conducted a rather innocuous cyber operation targeting Iran's Shahid Rajaee port, causing a temporary traffic jam among commercial shipping vehicles (Warrick and Nakashima 2020). To the Iranians and to the international community who were working to avoid any military escalation, the limited Israeli cyberattack marked an end to fears of impending war. Yet to Israeli civilians, the cyberattack was trumpeted as a remarkable sign of Israeli cyber prowess and a blow to the Iranian regime (Baram 2023). Once again, a country's leadership could have their cake and eat it too, appearing strong to domestic audiences while backing down from military escalation.\nZooming out, this study bears implications on three different aspects of conflict — the escalatory properties of cyber power, the efficacy of conflict signaling in the cyber age, and the role of public opinion in foreign affairs. First, regarding the debate over the escalatory dynamics of cyber operations, we can now add a small weight on the de-escalatory side of the scale. It was once thought that public exposure to frightening cyberattacks would cause mass demands for retaliation, generating\nescalatory pressure on leaders who must be responsive to public sentiment (Shandler, Gross, and Canetti 2022). Yet this idea has been refuted (Kreps and Schneider 2019), and the evidence now suggests that public opinion adds de-escalatory pressures to cyber operations, granting leaders the ability to act with restraint without worrying about militant domestic blowback.\nSecond, what does this finding mean for the future of conflict signaling? Credibility lies at the core of international relations, and leaders have developed sophisticated methods to send signals that overcome a built-in credibility deficit — the most famous of which are costly signaling. Yet according to this paper, rivals can no longer trust purportedly costly tied-hands signals if they know that the signaling leaders possess a path of action that allows them to avoid the imposition of audience costs - even if they back down from their threat. Absent any compensatory mechanisms, the reduced effectiveness of costly signaling will insert significant uncertainty into crisis bargaining and increase skepticism about the authenticity of military threats.\nOne option to salvage this popular form of signaling may be to issue more specific and severe threats. As a rule, leaders prefer to keep their options open by issuing general threats (Quek and Johnston 2018; Snyder and Borghard 2011). Yet the advent of cyber circumvention strategies may require that future threats become more specific in order to maintain their previous levels of credibility. For officials seeking to impose audience costs, they may now be required to declare that the United States Army will send ground forces from a particular unit to secure a site, or that the U.S. Air Force will launch specific missiles if a rival doesn't back down, since only highly specific guarantees can ensure that a cyber-attack will be perceived as inconsistent with the threats. Alternatively, leaders may be forced to rely on alternative signaling techniques, reweighing the form and balance of their signaling communications. While tied-hands signals are commonly conceived as being the most effective method of conveying intentions (Fearon 1997), leaders possess an arsenal of other techniques at their disposal that may now become more popular (Quek 2021).\nLast, regarding public opinion, we gain yet another piece of evidence attesting to the consequentiality of public opinion toward cyber operations. It is easy to dismiss the relevance of public opinion when it comes to international relations. Intricate dynamics of international conflict tend to take place above the heads of regular voters, who have historically deferred to elites in such matters (Berinsky 2009). Yet research consistently shows that public opinion can have a small yet meaningful effect on conflict decision-making (Sevenans 2021; Lin-Greenberg 2021; Tomz and Weeks 2020). This is especially the case when it comes to cyber power, and leaders must be attuned to public attitudes. We already know that public\nexposure to incoming cyberattacks can manifest major political consequences (Shandler, Gross, and Canetti 2023), and now we see that the reverse is true as well — that public enthusiasm for outgoing cyber operations can generate new conflict dynamics. It is a lessen well worth learning that public opinion matters in cyber conflict.\nI end by noting several research limitations that deserve attention. Most conspicuously, the phases of the experimental game — wherein a leader issues a threat, awaits a response, and then decides how to react — is but one of many possible scenarios in which cyber operations might be deployed. This echoes a frequent critique that audience cost experiments lack ecological validity (Snyder and Borghard 2011). While conceding that future research should examine the veracity of the findings under different scenarios, the core finding — that domestic audiences view cyberattacks as a demonstration of forceful leadership — is not reliant on the particular circumstances of this or any other study's experimental setup. The present study would also benefit from complementary research into how elites and foreign states view cyber operations. The ability of leaders to de-escalate conflict while still appearing strong in the eyes of domestic constituents is reliant on the fact that foreign actors will indeed view cyber operations as an act of restraint. To date, this second half of the equation is surmised on the basis of extensive observational and experimental studies that have accumulated in the literature (Jensen, Valeriano, and Whitt 2024; Lin-Greenberg 2023; Kostyuk and Gartzke 2022; Maschmeyer and Dunn Cavelty 2022; Gomez and Whyte 2020). Corroborating this component with robust experimental data would provide a fuller picture showing how different stakeholders perceived cyber capabilities, and how these perceptions are strategically consequential.\nI gratefully acknowledge the valuable feedback offered by colleagues and friends, among them: Daphna Canetti, Andres Gannon, Miguel Gomez, Erik Lin-Greenberg, Michael Gross, Nadiya Kostyuk, Harry Oppenheimer, Jordan Tama, Brandon Valeriano, and Christopher Whyte.

En exploitant la fascination des électeurs pour le cyberconflit, les dirigeants peuvent désormais désamorcer les crises en toute sécurité, sans avoir à craindre une censure nationale. Tel est l'attrait du cyberpouvoir chez le grand public que même des cyberattaques mineures, aux conséquences opérationnelles faibles, peuvent apaiser l'attente d'une puissante force militaire chez les électeurs. En pratique, cela signifie que les dirigeants qui seraient sinon tenus par des coûts d'audience nationaux peuvent y « échapper » en menant des cyberattaques à l'efficacité superficielle, mais suffisante pour les électeurs nationaux. Pour explorer la modération des pressions d'escalade nationales grâce aux cyberopérations, je mène une expérience de sondage qui demande aux participants d'évaluer les qualités de dirigeant de leur président après le déploiement d'une cyberforce ou d'une force conventionnelle. Les résultats confirment que le public considère les cyberattaques, même si elles sont éphémères et exemptes de conséquences, comme étant suffisamment vigoureuses pour répondre aux menaces de recours à la force d'un dirigeant et apaiser ses envies d'actions militaires. En proposant des exemples concrets de cette théorie dans de nombreux incidents du monde réels, je démontre que l'enthousiasme du public pour le cyberpouvoir ajoute une toute nouvelle flexibilité à la prise de décisions par temps de crise.\n## Introduction\nVoters are enthralled by cyber power. In the eyes of the public, cyber power is an almighty technological weapon that can pierce through enemy defenses — leaving a trail of destruction in its inscrutable wake (Shandler, Gross, and Canetti 2021). Cyberattacks arouse severe anxiety when turned against us , and they foster keen enthusiasm when used against our adversaries . These beliefs about cyber power are, of course, steeped in hyperbole — yet they are earnestly held by a credulous public who are buffeted by a constant din of sensationalist media reporting of cyber doom narratives (Makridis, Maschmeyer, and Smeets 2024; Lawson 2019). The disjoint between perception and reality presents political leaders with an opportunity to appear strong without taking strong action. Applying a framework of domestic audience\ncosts , I demonstrate how the allure of cyber power allows leaders to back down from explicit threats without suffering domestic censure. This finding reimagines the logic of audience costs for a digital age.\nDomestic politics and public opinion are integral features of many modern theories of international conflict . Democratic leaders pay keen attention to voters' attitudes toward war, with public opinion capable of acting as a constraint on escalation , or a spur that pushes leaders to retaliate . When it comes to cyber power, it was once thought that public engagement with cyberattacks would manifest in the latter category — adding escalatory momentum to conflict situations. So the thinking went, widespread exposure to frightening cyberattacks would lead to mass demands for retaliation, generating escalatory tailwinds and encouraging leaders to respond with any means necessary . Yet the reality turned out to be far more muted. The ambiguity and uncertainty associated with cyber threats undercut public support for retaliation (Jardine, Porter, and Shandler 2024), and predominantly subversive cyber operations failed to evoke the level of destructiveness that would generate domestic political pressure to engage in military action .\nThis article reimagines the effect of voters' captivation with cyber power, arguing that it acts as a check on conflict escalation by adding flexibility to crisis decision making. By exploiting the public enthusiasm for cyber force, leaders can safely de-escalate crisis situations without worrying about suffering domestic censure . I argue that when states conduct cyber operations, the domestic public are likely to view the use of cyberattacks as a strong sign of resolve — even if the effectiveness of the cyberattack is objectively limited. Essentially, cyber power enables leaders to de-escalate conflict without having to worry about suffering domestic censure for acting weakly or inconsistently on the international stage.\nUnderstanding the interplay between public opinion and cyber conflict requires that we descend from an international level of analysis, where most escalation debates play out, to an individual level of analysis grounded in political psychology and lay perceptions. In answering why low-cost, non-destructive cyber operations would ever be sufficient to placate hawkish domestic audiences  — the answer lies not in theories of signaling or compellence, but in theories of public opinion. Interpreting the impact of public opinion on foreign affairs requires that we interrogate the psychological and cognitive dimensions of cyber conflict, not its strategic impact.\nTo test whether cyber operations can truly temper domestic escalatory pressures, I conduct a survey experiment with a sample of American voters that asks participants to evaluate presidential leadership following the\ndeployment of cyber or conventional force. The experimental findings confirm that the public view cyberattacks — even ephemeral, inconsequential cyberattacks — as sufficiently forceful to meet a leader's threat of force and placate any public zeal for vengeance. I further verify that the results transcend partisan affiliation and recur at all levels of technological literacy.\nThese findings demonstrate how public perceptions of cyber power adds newfound flexibility to crisis decision making. By exploiting the public enthusiasm for cyber force, leaders can safely de-escalate crisis situations while maintaining a seemingly muscular foreign policy posture in the eyes of their domestic constituents. In the subsequent sections, I begin by laying out the foundations of public attitudes toward cyber conflict. After introducing the conceptual foundation, I present a novel experimental design and a set of results that verify the theory using the well-worn technique of audience-cost experiments. Last, I discuss the implications of the findings, and offer examples of how this theory has played out in real world incidents.\n## Voters' Perceptions of Cyber Power—A Terrifyingly Effective Domain\nPerceptions of cyber power are rooted in fear and emotions (Shandler, Snider, et al. 2022). A growing set of experimental works has demonstrated that voters experience mental anguish in the aftermath of cyberattacks. Exposure to even benign cyberattacks triggers spikes in stress and anxiety , threat perception , anger (Shandler, Gross, and Canetti 2022), dread , and a willingness to sacrifice civil liberties to protect against future attacks .\nThis inflated sense of threat among the public is driven by several features that are specific to cyberspace. The anonymity and mystique that are commonly associated with cyberspace exacerbate negative psychological responses, with unknown and seemingly omniscient perpetrators creating an environment of panic and helplessness (Dunn Cavelty 2012; Hansen and Nissenbaum 2009; Gomez and Whyte 2021). Moreover, the public's lack of technical sophistication when it comes to cyber threats ferments feelings of dread, a trend that is magnified by the constant exposure to seemingly irrepressible cyberattacks on a growing array of devices .\nMuch of the hyperbolic views of omnipotent and destructive cyber actors can be traced to sensationalized media coverage and popular culture depictions of cyber power . This dramatized coverage has come to be known as the “cyber doom narrative,” a teleological expectation that digital insecurity will inevitably result in mass societal collapse as our growing dependence on digital systems renders us vulnerable\nto attacks . Having been emotionally primed to experience dread, anxiety, and helplessness in the face of cyberattacks, it is no wonder that the public is liable to buy into the pervasive cultural narrative surrounding cyber threats. As a case in point, a field study of a mundane ransomware attack against a hospital in Germany revealed intense public anxiety, and a steep fall in voters' trust in their government, despite authorities' attempts to calm the jittery residents .\nWhile the public has developed a deep trepidation towards the destructive potential of cyber threats, it has, by the same logic, warmly embraced cyberattacks as an effective military offensive option. A series of experiments across multiple countries has observed a consistently high level of public enthusiasm for employing cyberattacks to respond to national security threats . Voters are enthused by the perceived capacity of cyberattacks as an operationally effective attack option that avoids placing troops in harm's way and which minimizes civilian casualties (Demarest, Jost, and Schub 2024). Even in response to the most egregious and deadly attacks, the public views cyberattacks as being a highly effective and appropriate retaliatory option (Gross, Canetti, and Vashdi 2017; Jardine et al. 2024).\nPublic beliefs about cyber power are made salient by the fact that cyber operations are now widely publicized. In the past, cyber operations were famous for taking place under a cloak of anonymity. Yet in recent years, there has been a distinct trend towards public disclosure of cyberattacks wherein authorities willingly publicize what were once secretive cyber operations . Leaders opt to openly divulge cyber operations to signal strength and prestige to external audiences , to legitimize investments in the cyber domain , and to undermine rivals' trust in technology infrastructure . This article reinforces an additional rationale for self-attribution, which is signaling strength and resolve to domestic audiences who are galvanized by displays of military force in general, and cyber-force in particular .\nIt would be understandable at this point for readers to protest that: public perceptions about cyber power are simply incorrect. I agree - public beliefs about cyber power do not necessarily match its constrained reality. Among military officials and cyber experts, the prevailing view holds that cyber power is incapable of independently effecting strategic outcomes, and that it is primarily effective as a force amplifier in coordination with conventional military forces (Valeriano, Jensen, and Maness 2018), or as an act of sub-crisis maneuvering that operates below the threshold of conflict . Nevertheless, the disjoint between public perceptions of cyber strength and the reality of its constrained effectiveness is precisely the phenomenon that creates a strategic opportunity for leaders to overcome domestic escalatory pressure.\nSpecifically, this paper targets two gaps in the cyber conflict literature that remain understudied. Much of the existing research on cyber power is dedicated to scrutinizing the objective effects and effectiveness of cyber operations. However, it is imperative that we also recognize the impact of (oftentimes distorted) perceptions about cyber power. Beliefs about cyber capabilities, even if untethered from reality, shape behavior and decision-making in real ways. Additionally, the accumulating research on public opinion and cyber power must take a final step to interrogate the strategic impact of public attitudes and beliefs. To date, mounting empirical research has demonstrated that cyberattacks roil public beliefs about international affairs and arouse strong emotional reactions . The missing step is to connect these public responses to concrete political outcomes to make the case of why public opinion matters. In the next section, we take this leap by interpreting public opinion through the prism of domestic audience costs.\n## Interpreting Cyber Operations Through the Lens of Audience Costs\nTo briefly revisit the main tenets of audience cost theory, governments manufacture domestic audience costs to credibly communicate resolve to actors in the international arena. By publicly threatening to employ military force, leaders add credibility to their signals, since both parties to the conflict are aware that domestic constituencies punish governments that say one thing and do another . The presence of audience costs transforms public threats from cheap talk into informative signals. According to the basic precepts of this theory, when a rival refuses to accede to a threat underpinned by audience costs, a leader has two principal options: to follow through on the threat and so escalate the conflict, or to back down from the threat and suffer domestic censure.\nCyber operations challenge this basic theory. What if there was an option for leaders to publicly issue a threat (an ostensibly costly signal), and yet avoid the imposition of audience costs were they to back down? I argue that cyberattacks can strike this delicate balance. To the domestic audience, wielding cyber power sends a message of strength since the public holds clear (if exaggerated) beliefs about the value and effectiveness of cyber power. Importantly, this domestically targeted message of strength is untethered to the operational effects produced by cyberattacks. As such, even minor cyberattacks with little operational or escalatory impact can placate voters' expectation of “strong” military resolve.\nINTERNATIONAL INTERACTIONS\n#\nIn Figure 1, I visualize an updated crisis bargaining model that newly incorporates cyberattacks as a distinct military option. The figure reimagines the traditional decision tree associated with audience cost theories, with the addition of a new option (D) depicted in blue. The scenario depicts a crisis between two players — who we can think of as a country (1) and a foreign rival (2). The game progresses with the country deciding at the first phase whether to publicly threaten the use of force against the foreign rival in attempt to achieve a strategic objective. If the country refrains from making any threat — then the scenario ends with them having decided to (A) stay out of the crisis. If the country issues a threat, and the foreign rival does not concede, then the onus moves back to the country to decide whether to (B) back down from their threat, or (C) follow through on their threat. Audience cost models are principally\nFigure 1. Updated crisis bargaining model with new cyberattack option.\nNote: The figure reflects the crisis scenario with expected domestic and strategic payoffs for player 1 presented under each terminal node. Ticks reflect the optimal outcomes, with no audience costs being preferred to the sufferance of audience costs, and de-escalation being preferred to military escalation. Only decision (D) leads to a situation where no audience costs are suffered and the crisis is de-escalated.\n|   | (B) Backs Down | (C) Follows Through | (D) Cyber Attack  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  Domestic Audience Cost: | Suffers Audience Cost | No Audience Cost | No Audience Cost  |\n|  Crisis Outcome: | De-Escalation | Military Escalation | De-Escalation  |\nconcerned with the difference between staying out and backing down, since publics demonstrably punish leaders who renege on their commitments.\nUntil now, these first options reflect the typical crisis bargaining model. Each of options (B) and (C) yields a negative consequence. By backing down from a threat, a government can refrain from unwanted military escalation, but will suffer a drop in public approval as their domestic constituents punish them for acting inconsistently and weakly . Alternatively, by following through and engaging in military action, a government can avoid domestic denunciation, but must prepare for a military conflagration whose consequences are unknown. We now add an additional avenue of action (D) — which depicts a government decision to conduct a cyberattack.\nBased on the above analysis describing how voters perceive cyber power, we can expect that employing a cyberattack allows the government player to mitigate any negative consequences — epitomizing a digital get out jail free card. The evidence suggests that cyber operations conducted in isolation are not a replacement for conventional warfare , and they are unlikely to engender escalatory consequences (Jensen, Valeriano, and Whitt 2024; Lin-Greenberg 2023; Libicki 2020; Fischerkeller and Harknett 2017). Yet from the perspective of the public, the cyberattack would be viewed as an act of force and a clear expression of intent. Seeing as the public view cyberspace as an effective operational domain, comparable to air and land power, launching a cyberattack meets the initial promise of force and allays any modicum of inconsistency that would give rise to audience costs. The country's leader, in this scenario, has the best of both worlds — they have backed down from a potentially escalatory conflict situation while avoiding domestic political consequences.\nAdmittedly, this logical chain of events represents just one scenario in which offensive cyber operations might be used in conflict settings. Nevertheless, this model of crisis bargaining has served to theorize about leader's decision making for decades, and there is value in overlaying cyber operations on a well-formed model of international relations. Our central focus of interest is whether benign cyber operations can effectively send signals of strength to domestic audiences. On this basis, I put forward the following testable hypothesis: cyberattacks, even those with limited operational effects, will be interpreted as a signal of strength and an effective projection of force by domestic audiences.\n## Experimental Methodology\nTo test the above theoretical framework, I employ a well-trodden pathway for experimentally examining audience costs that relies on original survey\nINTERNATIONAL INTERACTIONS\n#\nexperiments. Since Tomz (2007) first introduced a technique to empirically scrutinize the phenomenon, a series of subsequent experiments have corroborated its veracity and successfully replicated and extended the inherent logic of audience costs . This experimental approach has proven popular because selection biases mean that audience costs are difficulty to study through observational data. $^{1}$\nThe experimental design involved fielding an online survey experiment in March 2021 on a national sample of 960 Americans recruited using the Prolific Survey Panel. The study respondents represented a cross-section of the general population (mean age = 35 years, SD = 12.9). The sample's political orientation leans slightly to the left, with 56% of respondents self-identifying as progressive, while the gender distribution is exactly 50% male and female. Since the purpose of the study is to challenge the conventional logic of audience costs, the structure of the experiment draws heavily from the setup introduced in Tomz's (2007) audience cost study, which has been subject to extensive corroboration and replication. All research design and hypotheses were pre-registered prior to data collection.\nTo begin, all respondents were introduced to a scenario according to which \"a foreign country sent its military to take over a territorial region of its neighboring country.\" Respondents were then randomly assigned to one of five treatment conditions (see Table 1) that varied whether or not the U.S. president threatened to intervene and use force, and whether the president followed through on the threat in one way or another. In the stay out condition, which acts as a control group, the president pledges to stay out of the conflict, and indeed refrains from engaging in any conflict. In the other four treatment groups, respondents are told that \"the U.S. president declared that if the attacking country continues to invade, the U.S. military would immediately engage and attempt to push out the\n$^{1}$ I acknowledge a resilient school of thought that casts doubt on the empirical validity and theoretical persuasiveness of the phenomenon. One group of critics claim that artificially constructed experimental scenarios lack ecological and external validity since leaders allegedly fail to issue explicit threats,  or because fictional experiments overstate the costs that respondents impose on real leaders . Another group of critics posit that the absence of real-world crises with corresponding audience cost outcomes calls into question the external validity of this theory . While conceding the need to carefully construct experimental techniques that mimic real-world scenarios, I suggest that real-world events needn't accord precisely with the phased layout of the experimental structure for us to learn valuable lessons.\n$^{2}$ While all online survey panels have a mixed reputation regarding the representativeness of their participant pools, research has shown that the Prolific panel is superior in terms of the comprehension, attention, and honesty of responses compared to other panels (Douglas, Ewell, and Brauer 2023; Eyal et al. 2021).\n$^{3}$ The research design was approved by the Research Ethics (IRB) Committee of the authors' institution (approval # 120/21).\n#\nR. SHANDLER\nTable 1. Description of treatment conditions.\n|  Treatment condition | N | Presidential threat / declaration | Implemented action  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  Stay out | 190 | The president declared that the U.S. would stay out of the conflict. | The U.S. refrained from engaging in the conflict.  |\n|  Back down | 210 | The president threatened that the U.S. military would engage and push out the attacking country | The U.S. backed down and did not engage the attacking country in any way.  |\n|  Engage militarily (Follow Through) | 175 | The president threatened that the U.S. military would engage and push out the attacking country | Deployed grounds troops against the attacking country  |\n|  Major (degradative) cyberattack | 181 | The president threatened that the U.S. military would engage and push out the attacking country | Major degradative cyberattack that crippled the attacking force's communication networks and rendered its radar system inoperable  |\n|  Minor (disruptive) cyberattack | 204 | The president threatened that the U.S. military would engage and push out the attacking country | Minor disruptive cyberattack that slowed the attacker's digital systems and publicized sensitive personnel files.  |\nattacking country.\" In each of these four conditions, the scenario continues with the president either backing down from the threat and abstaining from any military action (back down condition), deploying ground troops against the attacking country (engage militarily condition), employing major degradative cyberattacks that operationally cripple the attacking country's military forces (major cyberattack condition), or employing minor disruptive cyberattacks that cause temporary disruptions to the attacking country's digital systems (minor cyberattack condition). The full survey instruments appear in Online Appendix A, along with balance tables and treatment randomization checks.\nConsistent with other iterations of this experimental structure, I control for outcomes by ensuring that all treatment conditions lead to the same endpoint, with the hostile state gaining  $20\\%$  of the contested territory regardless of whether the President engages or stays out . Likewise, seeing as domestic casualties are a central guiding factor in military approval, I control for this by ensuring that the United States experiences zero casualties in any scenario.4\nFollowing exposure to one of the conflict conditions, which was reinforced through a series of attention checks, I measured the dependent variable of interest by asking participants whether they approved or disapproved of the way the President handled the situation on a seven-point scale. Additionally, I collected data on respondents' dispositional\nINTERNATIONAL INTERACTIONS\n#\ncharacteristics such as militant assertiveness using a scale developed by Herrmann, Tetlock, and Visser (1999), international trust via a measured produced by Brewer (2004), and political ideology using the standard measure from the American National Election Studies. I further collected a comprehensive battery of demographic characteristics, including gender, employment, age, level of education, and technological literacy. Information on the scales and sources of all collected measures appears in the Online Appendix.\n# Results\nTo assess how use of force decisions give rise to audience costs, Figure 2 reveals the average treatment effect of each experimental condition on presidential approval. The average treatment effect consists of a regression coefficient estimate for each proxy treatment group when compared to the baseline \"Stay Out\" condition. $^{6}$  For this first analysis, I combine the two cyberattacks treatments into one overarching cyber group to construct a general cyber effect.\nA number of results immediately leap out. First, similarly to all audience cost experiments, we can see that the typical audience cost effect (conceptualized as the effect of backing down from a commitment compared to staying out of the conflict) is negative, large, and statistically significant  $(\\beta = -1.622, p &lt; .000)$ . This finding rehashes the central tenet of domestic audience costs, showing that voters will punish a leader for issuing a threat to use force and then backing down. Likewise, we can be encouraged by the fact that the level of support for engaging militarily (and not acting inconsistently) also acts as expected, with no statistically significant difference between military engagement and staying out of the conflict  $(\\beta = .151, p = \\mathrm{n.s.})$ . Essentially, voters are looking for consistency; they will not punish the president for evincing a desire to stay out of the conflict and doing so, nor will they punish the president for making a threat and following through. Only backing down from an explicit threat leads to domestic censure.\nWhen turning to our primary variable of interest, the effect of conducting cyberattacks, we can observe a slight but statistically significant increase in presidential approval following a cyberattack, compared to the\n6The full regression output appears in Online Appendix E.\n7The belligerence cost effect is necessarily smaller than the audience cost effect, since inconsistent behavior makes up the majority of an audience cost . The public applies a belligerence cost due to disapproval of aggressive behavior, even if it is consistent with past promises. In the presented results, engaging militarily did not lead to any statistically significant decrease in public approval. This is consistent with past findings by Lin-Greenberg (2019) and Croco, Hanmer, and McDonald (2021), and contrasts with Kertzer and Brutger (2016) who identified a slight but statistically significant belligerence cost.\n#\nR. SHANDLER\nFigure 2. Situational approval by experimental condition.\nNote: This plot depicts estimates of the treatment effect of each experimental condition on presidential approval relative to the stay out condition.

Bars represent  $95\\%$  confidence intervals and dots depict estimate means.\nbaseline stay out condition ( $\\beta = .360$ ,  $p &lt; .019$ ). According to our conceptualization of this treatment, cyberattacks constitute a repudiation of the initial promise, almost akin to backing down. The president had declared that the U.S. military would actively engage and push out the attacking country's forces. Yet far from actualizing this commitment, the president contented with a single barrage of cyberattacks against the attacking country's forces that merely publicized sensitive information or targeted its radar systems. Neither action represents a level of military engagement sufficient to \"push back the attacking forces,\" and the rival country would certainly view such an attack as a token and de-escalatory signal. Yet even though this path of action represents the kind of inconsistency that should evoke domestic disapproval — as with the back down condition — the public actually reports a slight increase in approval. As theorized, it appears that that a leader can back down from a threat without suffering domestic\ncensure simply by deploying militarily trivial cyber operations that appear forceful to domestic constituents.\nA fact that adds credibility to this reading of the results is the fact that the public keenly distinguishes between greater and lesser military action. Lin-Greenberg (2019) found that leaders who committed to full military action can partially mitigate audience costs by deploying lesser attack techniques such as air-strikes or sanctions. Lin-Greenberg's alternative attack options fell somewhere in between realizing the full-throated military threat and completely backing down — and the public was able to discern this important distinction leading to lowered but not entirely mitigated audience costs. Yet in the case of cyberattacks, we don't see merely reduced audience costs, we see an actual increase in approval ratings. The study respondents viewed the cyberattack as a kept promise, even though its effectiveness is objectively limited. This accords with research by Shandler, Gross, and Canetti (2021) who revealed a strong public enthusiasm for cyber warfare on the basis of its being perceived as an operationally effective military option that minimizes friendly and collateral deaths.\n### Breaking Down Cyberattacks—Degradative Versus Disruptive Strikes\nTo add additional nuance to the analyses, and to avoid the critique of earlier audience cost experiments that oversimplified the choices available to leaders, I break down cyberattacks into degradative (major) cyberattacks and disruptive (minor) cyberattacks. Disruptive cyber techniques differ from degradative attacks in the permanence, the destructiveness, and the operational effectiveness of the attack. We could expect that the rarer, and more degradative cyberattacks are far likelier to be construed by the public as meeting the leader's initial promise of “military engagement that pushes back the attackers' forces.” Disruptive cyberattacks, by contrast, should not even come close to meeting this promise and should be viewed as wholly equivalent to backing down.\nIn Figure 3, I again illustrate the average treatment effect for each experimental condition, though this time dividing the previously uniform cyberattacks into degradative and disruptive cyberattacks. Furthermore, I add an interaction effect to account for the respondents' level of technological literacy. This heterogeneous factor is crucial for the subsequent analysis since research has consistently shown that people's level of digital sophistication guides their perceptions of the efficacy of cyber threats and operations .\n#\nR. SHANDLER\nFigure 3. Situational approval by experimental condition—conditional on technological literacy.\nNote: This plot depicts estimates of the treatment effect of each experimental condition on presidential approval relative to the stay out condition. Estimates are based on an OLS model with interaction effects between tech literacy and each proxy experimental condition. Bars represent  $95\\%$  confidence intervals and dots depict estimate means.\nFigure 3 reveals that no audience costs are levied for either degradative or disruptive attacks. In essence, the public perceives even minor cyberattacks that have no lasting operational benefits as meeting the commitment of leaders to \"push back an attacker.\" Critically, we can see that the wide-ranging approval of cyberattacks is not contingent on technological literacy. One would think that high-tech literacy respondents would be more aware of the limited effects produced by cyber operations and that this group would recognize that minor, disruptive cyber operations do not meet the promise of a strong military response — but even high-tech literacy respondents refrained from imposing audience costs on leaders who deployed cyberattacks in lieu of conventional force. Both technologically literate and illiterate respondents refrain from punishing a leader for employing cyber operations, granting presidential flexibility across the board.\nHeterogeneous Effects: Hawks and Doves\nAs a third analysis, I examine whether the cyber pathway of avoiding audience costs holds when viewed through the lens of political orientation. I take this step since studies have identified that the strength of audience costs is highly conditional upon political orientation . Kertzer and Brutger (2016) even found that hawks and doves apply audience costs for different reasons — with hawks primarily punishing inconsistency and doves punishing belligerence along with inconsistency.\nIn Figure 4, I once again illustrate the average treatment effect for each experimental condition, including an interaction effect to account for political orientation. Since we are dealing with foreign policy views, I use militant assertiveness to distinguish between hawkishness and dovishness, a measure that tests beliefs about the desirability and effectiveness of the use of force in foreign policy. This three-item scale, developed by Herrmann, Tetlock, and Visser (1999), is commonly used in experimental studies that focus on foreign policy attitudes rather than purely domestic political attitudes.\nThe results reveal that when it comes to backing down and engaging militarily, the participants act as expected. Doves apply a substantial audience cost that is made up of an inconsistency cost (49%) that censures the perceived inconsistency of the president's actions, and a belligerence cost (51%) that punishes the threats of force. Hawks, by contrast, apply a larger audience cost than doves, and this cost is made up entirely by the overwhelming aversion to the perceived inconsistency of the president's behavior (> 100%). Both hawks and doves impose audience costs, just for different reasons.\nBut how do these groups look upon the exercise of cyberattacks? Looking at Figure 4, we can see that both groups refrain from imposing any audience costs when leaders execute disruptive or degradative cyberattacks that depart from their initial promises. It appears that the use of cyberattacks moderates the extremities of the partisan divide over conducting military action. Looking at the “engage militarily” column, we can see that hawks reward leaders who engage in military action in accordance with their commitments, while doves punish leaders for their belligerence. Yet these extremes are visibly softened for both types of cyberattacks. Doves view the use of cyberattacks as less severe than conventional military engagements, and so the belligerence cost and the inconsistency cost disappear. Meanwhile, hawks are slightly less enamored of cyberattacks compared to conventional military attacks, but still find them to be sufficiently forceful to meet the initial promise and so avoid any semblance of inconsistency. Though there remain differences between these groups, cyberattacks demonstrate enormous promise in striking a middle ground that can assuage even the highly partisan perceptions of hawks and doves towards the use of force in conflict settings.\n#\nR. SHANDLER\nFigure 4. Situational approval by experimental condition—conditional on militant assertiveness (Hawks vs. Doves).\nNote: This plot depicts estimates of the treatment effect of each experimental condition on presidential approval relative to the stay out condition. Estimates are based on an OLS model with interaction effects between tech literacy and each proxy experimental condition. Bars represent  $95\\%$  confidence intervals and dots depict estimate means.\n# Robustness Tests\nResearchers have critiqued the use of hypothetical presidential figures in international relations experiments on the basis that presidential evaluations are largely driven by partisan cues that are absent in fictitious vignettes . To test the robustness of the current results in face of this critique, the survey participants were asked, as the experiment continued, to view updated conflict scenarios that depicted President Biden and Iran as the relevant actors. The alternate dependent variables in this case asked about the level of approval of President Biden's handling of the situation and measured the named President's job approval. I analyze this alternative experimental structure in Online Appendix C, finding that the same results recur under both hypothetical and realistic character representations. The study findings are also robust when excluding participants who failed any of the attention checks that were administered following the experimental treatments.\nDiscussion\nThis article proposes that the emergence of cyber capabilities has altered the nature of domestic audience costs. By taking advantage of voters' captivation with cyber power, and their understandable if erroneous belief in the operational effectiveness of cyber capabilities, leaders can back down from international threats while still appearing strong in the eyes of domestic constituents. I verify this theory through a novel experimental design, which confirms that the public views even minor cyberattacks — an objective signal of restraint — as sufficiently forceful to meet a leader's threat of force and avoid any semblance of inconsistency.\nEven with a well-founded theory backed up by robust experimental evidence, we must be careful when generalizing controlled experimental results to real-world events. Voters don't evaluate presidential performance in the artificial environment of survey experiments, and military conflict rarely abides by such clearly delineated phases of threats and responses as laid out in simplified experimental scenarios . Therefore, it behooves us to look for real-world examples of cyber audience costs that can corroborate the theory. Even if we cannot isolate specific causal mechanisms when examining historical events, it would be highly suggestive were we to find corroborating examples where minor cyberattacks were advertised as demonstrations of strength to domestic audiences, even while they were objectively used to walk back threats of escalation. I offer two cases where this behavior can be partly observed.\nA first real-world example occurred on June 20, 2019, when Iran shot down a U.S. R1-4 Global Hawk UAV . President Trump immediately and publicly threatened massive retaliatory military strikes against targets inside Iran, claiming that Iran faced “obliteration” for their acts. The threat was ignored by Iranian authorities who insisted that they would continue to shoot down any U.S. assets that entered Iranian airspace . Yet even after publicly issuing a threat, President Trump backed down from the initial threat, sufficing with a series of cyberattacks that disabled Iran's ability to track ships in the region and compromised Iran's missile defense systems .\nFrom every possible angle, it is indisputable that President Trump walked back his initial threat, setting in place the precise conditions that should give rise to critical domestic censure and generate inconsistency costs. In lieu of the promised “obliteration,” the American response de-escalated the situation by conducting a relatively minor cyberattack that signaled restraint. The cyberattack was effectively used as an off-ramp to avoid a dangerous escalation of hostilities , and indeed this cycle of hostilities came to an end.\nYet to the domestic public, the restrained cyberattack was not viewed as a capitulation. Even though the attack objectively failed to meet the severity of the initial promise to “obliterate” Iran, the cyberattack was still viewed as a signal of strength and resolve. Comparing polls taken immediately prior and following the incident, President Trump suffered no situational disapproval or lowered confidence in voters' perceptions of his ability to handle the situation in Iran (Pew Research Center 2019). In fact, the Trump administration may have exploited the secrecy that is inherently connected with cyber operations to inflate voters' beliefs about the attack's impact . By emphasizing the covertness of the attack and the ambiguity associated with the effects, media coverage of the incident likely inflated public perceptions about the severity of the muted cyberattack.\nA similar scenario played out in Israel one year later. During April 2020, Iranian hackers infiltrated the systems of an Israeli water plant (Times of Israel 2020). The hackers sought to cripple computer systems that controlled water flow and raise the level of chlorine within the water mix that was distributed to Israeli homes. The incident was thwarted before it could cause major damage, though it sent shivers down the country's spine. Israeli citizens were baying for blood, and Israeli leadership declared that the targeting of civilian infrastructure was a “red line” that warranted swift, decisive, and massive retaliation.\nYet massive retaliation did not arrive. Instead, Israel conducted a rather innocuous cyber operation targeting Iran's Shahid Rajaee port, causing a temporary traffic jam among commercial shipping vehicles . To the Iranians and to the international community who were working to avoid any military escalation, the limited Israeli cyberattack marked an end to fears of impending war. Yet to Israeli civilians, the cyberattack was trumpeted as a remarkable sign of Israeli cyber prowess and a blow to the Iranian regime . Once again, a country's leadership could have their cake and eat it too, appearing strong to domestic audiences while backing down from military escalation.\nZooming out, this study bears implications on three different aspects of conflict — the escalatory properties of cyber power, the efficacy of conflict signaling in the cyber age, and the role of public opinion in foreign affairs. First, regarding the debate over the escalatory dynamics of cyber operations, we can now add a small weight on the de-escalatory side of the scale. It was once thought that public exposure to frightening cyberattacks would cause mass demands for retaliation, generating\nescalatory pressure on leaders who must be responsive to public sentiment (Shandler, Gross, and Canetti 2022). Yet this idea has been refuted , and the evidence now suggests that public opinion adds de-escalatory pressures to cyber operations, granting leaders the ability to act with restraint without worrying about militant domestic blowback.\nSecond, what does this finding mean for the future of conflict signaling? Credibility lies at the core of international relations, and leaders have developed sophisticated methods to send signals that overcome a built-in credibility deficit — the most famous of which are costly signaling. Yet according to this paper, rivals can no longer trust purportedly costly tied-hands signals if they know that the signaling leaders possess a path of action that allows them to avoid the imposition of audience costs - even if they back down from their threat. Absent any compensatory mechanisms, the reduced effectiveness of costly signaling will insert significant uncertainty into crisis bargaining and increase skepticism about the authenticity of military threats.\nOne option to salvage this popular form of signaling may be to issue more specific and severe threats. As a rule, leaders prefer to keep their options open by issuing general threats . Yet the advent of cyber circumvention strategies may require that future threats become more specific in order to maintain their previous levels of credibility. For officials seeking to impose audience costs, they may now be required to declare that the United States Army will send ground forces from a particular unit to secure a site, or that the U.S. Air Force will launch specific missiles if a rival doesn't back down, since only highly specific guarantees can ensure that a cyber-attack will be perceived as inconsistent with the threats. Alternatively, leaders may be forced to rely on alternative signaling techniques, reweighing the form and balance of their signaling communications. While tied-hands signals are commonly conceived as being the most effective method of conveying intentions , leaders possess an arsenal of other techniques at their disposal that may now become more popular .\nLast, regarding public opinion, we gain yet another piece of evidence attesting to the consequentiality of public opinion toward cyber operations. It is easy to dismiss the relevance of public opinion when it comes to international relations. Intricate dynamics of international conflict tend to take place above the heads of regular voters, who have historically deferred to elites in such matters . Yet research consistently shows that public opinion can have a small yet meaningful effect on conflict decision-making . This is especially the case when it comes to cyber power, and leaders must be attuned to public attitudes. We already know that public\nexposure to incoming cyberattacks can manifest major political consequences (Shandler, Gross, and Canetti 2023), and now we see that the reverse is true as well — that public enthusiasm for outgoing cyber operations can generate new conflict dynamics. It is a lessen well worth learning that public opinion matters in cyber conflict.\nI end by noting several research limitations that deserve attention. Most conspicuously, the phases of the experimental game — wherein a leader issues a threat, awaits a response, and then decides how to react — is but one of many possible scenarios in which cyber operations might be deployed. This echoes a frequent critique that audience cost experiments lack ecological validity . While conceding that future research should examine the veracity of the findings under different scenarios, the core finding — that domestic audiences view cyberattacks as a demonstration of forceful leadership — is not reliant on the particular circumstances of this or any other study's experimental setup. The present study would also benefit from complementary research into how elites and foreign states view cyber operations. The ability of leaders to de-escalate conflict while still appearing strong in the eyes of domestic constituents is reliant on the fact that foreign actors will indeed view cyber operations as an act of restraint. To date, this second half of the equation is surmised on the basis of extensive observational and experimental studies that have accumulated in the literature (Jensen, Valeriano, and Whitt 2024; Lin-Greenberg 2023; Kostyuk and Gartzke 2022; Maschmeyer and Dunn Cavelty 2022; Gomez and Whyte 2020). Corroborating this component with robust experimental data would provide a fuller picture showing how different stakeholders perceived cyber capabilities, and how these perceptions are strategically consequential.\nI gratefully acknowledge the valuable feedback offered by colleagues and friends, among them: Daphna Canetti, Andres Gannon, Miguel Gomez, Erik Lin-Greenberg, Michael Gross, Nadiya Kostyuk, Harry Oppenheimer, Jordan Tama, Brandon Valeriano, and Christopher Whyte. The paper benefited greatly from comments offered at the 2023 Cyber Escalation in Conflict workshop hosted by Erik Gartzke, Jelena Vićić, and Gil Baram, and at the ISA 2022 Annual Conference.

En exploitant la fascination des électeurs pour le cyberconflit, les dirigeants peuvent désormais désamorcer les crises en toute sécurité, sans avoir à craindre une censure nationale. Tel est l'attrait du cyberpouvoir chez le grand public que même des cyberattaques mineures, aux conséquences opérationnelles faibles, peuvent apaiser l'attente d'une puissante force militaire chez les électeurs. En pratique, cela signifie que les dirigeants qui seraient sinon tenus par des coûts d'audience nationaux peuvent y « échapper » en menant des cyberattaques à l'efficacité superficielle, mais suffisante pour les électeurs nationaux. Pour explorer la modération des pressions d'escalade nationales grâce aux cyberopérations, je mène une expérience de sondage qui demande aux participants d'évaluer les qualités de dirigeant de leur président après le déploiement d'une cyberforce ou d'une force conventionnelle. Les résultats confirment que le public considère les cyberattaques, même si elles sont éphémères et exemptes de conséquences, comme étant suffisamment vigoureuses pour répondre aux menaces de recours à la force d'un dirigeant et apaiser ses envies d'actions militaires. En proposant des exemples concrets de cette théorie dans de nombreux incidents du monde réels, je démontre que l'enthousiasme du public pour le cyberpouvoir ajoute une toute nouvelle flexibilité à la prise de décisions par temps de crise.",
    "## Introduction": "Voters are enthralled by cyber power. In the eyes of the public, cyber power is an almighty technological weapon that can pierce through enemy defenses — leaving a trail of destruction in its inscrutable wake (Shandler, Gross, and Canetti 2021). Cyberattacks arouse severe anxiety when turned against us , and they foster keen enthusiasm when used against our adversaries . These beliefs about cyber power are, of course, steeped in hyperbole — yet they are earnestly held by a credulous public who are buffeted by a constant din of sensationalist media reporting of cyber doom narratives (Makridis, Maschmeyer, and Smeets 2024; Lawson 2019). The disjoint between perception and reality presents political leaders with an opportunity to appear strong without taking strong action. Applying a framework of domestic audience\ncosts , I demonstrate how the allure of cyber power allows leaders to back down from explicit threats without suffering domestic censure. This finding reimagines the logic of audience costs for a digital age.\nDomestic politics and public opinion are integral features of many modern theories of international conflict . Democratic leaders pay keen attention to voters' attitudes toward war, with public opinion capable of acting as a constraint on escalation , or a spur that pushes leaders to retaliate . When it comes to cyber power, it was once thought that public engagement with cyberattacks would manifest in the latter category — adding escalatory momentum to conflict situations. So the thinking went, widespread exposure to frightening cyberattacks would lead to mass demands for retaliation, generating escalatory tailwinds and encouraging leaders to respond with any means necessary . Yet the reality turned out to be far more muted. The ambiguity and uncertainty associated with cyber threats undercut public support for retaliation (Jardine, Porter, and Shandler 2024), and predominantly subversive cyber operations failed to evoke the level of destructiveness that would generate domestic political pressure to engage in military action .\nThis article reimagines the effect of voters' captivation with cyber power, arguing that it acts as a check on conflict escalation by adding flexibility to crisis decision making. By exploiting the public enthusiasm for cyber force, leaders can safely de-escalate crisis situations without worrying about suffering domestic censure . I argue that when states conduct cyber operations, the domestic public are likely to view the use of cyberattacks as a strong sign of resolve — even if the effectiveness of the cyberattack is objectively limited. Essentially, cyber power enables leaders to de-escalate conflict without having to worry about suffering domestic censure for acting weakly or inconsistently on the international stage.\nUnderstanding the interplay between public opinion and cyber conflict requires that we descend from an international level of analysis, where most escalation debates play out, to an individual level of analysis grounded in political psychology and lay perceptions. In answering why low-cost, non-destructive cyber operations would ever be sufficient to placate hawkish domestic audiences  — the answer lies not in theories of signaling or compellence, but in theories of public opinion. Interpreting the impact of public opinion on foreign affairs requires that we interrogate the psychological and cognitive dimensions of cyber conflict, not its strategic impact.\nTo test whether cyber operations can truly temper domestic escalatory pressures, I conduct a survey experiment with a sample of American voters that asks participants to evaluate presidential leadership following the\ndeployment of cyber or conventional force. The experimental findings confirm that the public view cyberattacks — even ephemeral, inconsequential cyberattacks — as sufficiently forceful to meet a leader's threat of force and placate any public zeal for vengeance. I further verify that the results transcend partisan affiliation and recur at all levels of technological literacy.\nThese findings demonstrate how public perceptions of cyber power adds newfound flexibility to crisis decision making. By exploiting the public enthusiasm for cyber force, leaders can safely de-escalate crisis situations while maintaining a seemingly muscular foreign policy posture in the eyes of their domestic constituents. In the subsequent sections, I begin by laying out the foundations of public attitudes toward cyber conflict. After introducing the conceptual foundation, I present a novel experimental design and a set of results that verify the theory using the well-worn technique of audience-cost experiments. Last, I discuss the implications of the findings, and offer examples of how this theory has played out in real world incidents.",
    "# Results": "To assess how use of force decisions give rise to audience costs, Figure 2 reveals the average treatment effect of each experimental condition on presidential approval. The average treatment effect consists of a regression coefficient estimate for each proxy treatment group when compared to the baseline \"Stay Out\" condition. $^{6}$  For this first analysis, I combine the two cyberattacks treatments into one overarching cyber group to construct a general cyber effect.\nA number of results immediately leap out. First, similarly to all audience cost experiments, we can see that the typical audience cost effect (conceptualized as the effect of backing down from a commitment compared to staying out of the conflict) is negative, large, and statistically significant  $(\\beta = -1.622, p &lt; .000)$ . This finding rehashes the central tenet of domestic audience costs, showing that voters will punish a leader for issuing a threat to use force and then backing down. Likewise, we can be encouraged by the fact that the level of support for engaging militarily (and not acting inconsistently) also acts as expected, with no statistically significant difference between military engagement and staying out of the conflict  $(\\beta = .151, p = \\mathrm{n.s.})$ . Essentially, voters are looking for consistency; they will not punish the president for evincing a desire to stay out of the conflict and doing so, nor will they punish the president for making a threat and following through. Only backing down from an explicit threat leads to domestic censure.\nWhen turning to our primary variable of interest, the effect of conducting cyberattacks, we can observe a slight but statistically significant increase in presidential approval following a cyberattack, compared to the\n6The full regression output appears in Online Appendix E.\n7The belligerence cost effect is necessarily smaller than the audience cost effect, since inconsistent behavior makes up the majority of an audience cost . The public applies a belligerence cost due to disapproval of aggressive behavior, even if it is consistent with past promises. In the presented results, engaging militarily did not lead to any statistically significant decrease in public approval. This is consistent with past findings by Lin-Greenberg (2019) and Croco, Hanmer, and McDonald (2021), and contrasts with Kertzer and Brutger (2016) who identified a slight but statistically significant belligerence cost.\n#\nR. SHANDLER\nFigure 2. Situational approval by experimental condition.\nNote: This plot depicts estimates of the treatment effect of each experimental condition on presidential approval relative to the stay out condition.

Bars represent  $95\\%$  confidence intervals and dots depict estimate means.\nbaseline stay out condition ( $\\beta = .360$ ,  $p &lt; .019$ ). According to our conceptualization of this treatment, cyberattacks constitute a repudiation of the initial promise, almost akin to backing down. The president had declared that the U.S. military would actively engage and push out the attacking country's forces. Yet far from actualizing this commitment, the president contented with a single barrage of cyberattacks against the attacking country's forces that merely publicized sensitive information or targeted its radar systems. Neither action represents a level of military engagement sufficient to \"push back the attacking forces,\" and the rival country would certainly view such an attack as a token and de-escalatory signal. Yet even though this path of action represents the kind of inconsistency that should evoke domestic disapproval — as with the back down condition — the public actually reports a slight increase in approval. As theorized, it appears that that a leader can back down from a threat without suffering domestic\ncensure simply by deploying militarily trivial cyber operations that appear forceful to domestic constituents.\nA fact that adds credibility to this reading of the results is the fact that the public keenly distinguishes between greater and lesser military action. Lin-Greenberg (2019) found that leaders who committed to full military action can partially mitigate audience costs by deploying lesser attack techniques such as air-strikes or sanctions. Lin-Greenberg's alternative attack options fell somewhere in between realizing the full-throated military threat and completely backing down — and the public was able to discern this important distinction leading to lowered but not entirely mitigated audience costs. Yet in the case of cyberattacks, we don't see merely reduced audience costs, we see an actual increase in approval ratings. The study respondents viewed the cyberattack as a kept promise, even though its effectiveness is objectively limited. This accords with research by Shandler, Gross, and Canetti (2021) who revealed a strong public enthusiasm for cyber warfare on the basis of its being perceived as an operationally effective military option that minimizes friendly and collateral deaths.\n### Breaking Down Cyberattacks—Degradative Versus Disruptive Strikes\nTo add additional nuance to the analyses, and to avoid the critique of earlier audience cost experiments that oversimplified the choices available to leaders, I break down cyberattacks into degradative (major) cyberattacks and disruptive (minor) cyberattacks. Disruptive cyber techniques differ from degradative attacks in the permanence, the destructiveness, and the operational effectiveness of the attack. We could expect that the rarer, and more degradative cyberattacks are far likelier to be construed by the public as meeting the leader's initial promise of “military engagement that pushes back the attackers' forces.” Disruptive cyberattacks, by contrast, should not even come close to meeting this promise and should be viewed as wholly equivalent to backing down.\nIn Figure 3, I again illustrate the average treatment effect for each experimental condition, though this time dividing the previously uniform cyberattacks into degradative and disruptive cyberattacks. Furthermore, I add an interaction effect to account for the respondents' level of technological literacy. This heterogeneous factor is crucial for the subsequent analysis since research has consistently shown that people's level of digital sophistication guides their perceptions of the efficacy of cyber threats and operations .\n#\nR. SHANDLER\nFigure 3. Situational approval by experimental condition—conditional on technological literacy.\nNote: This plot depicts estimates of the treatment effect of each experimental condition on presidential approval relative to the stay out condition. Estimates are based on an OLS model with interaction effects between tech literacy and each proxy experimental condition. Bars represent  $95\\%$  confidence intervals and dots depict estimate means.\nFigure 3 reveals that no audience costs are levied for either degradative or disruptive attacks. In essence, the public perceives even minor cyberattacks that have no lasting operational benefits as meeting the commitment of leaders to \"push back an attacker.\" Critically, we can see that the wide-ranging approval of cyberattacks is not contingent on technological literacy. One would think that high-tech literacy respondents would be more aware of the limited effects produced by cyber operations and that this group would recognize that minor, disruptive cyber operations do not meet the promise of a strong military response — but even high-tech literacy respondents refrained from imposing audience costs on leaders who deployed cyberattacks in lieu of conventional force. Both technologically literate and illiterate respondents refrain from punishing a leader for employing cyber operations, granting presidential flexibility across the board.\nHeterogeneous Effects: Hawks and Doves\nAs a third analysis, I examine whether the cyber pathway of avoiding audience costs holds when viewed through the lens of political orientation. I take this step since studies have identified that the strength of audience costs is highly conditional upon political orientation . Kertzer and Brutger (2016) even found that hawks and doves apply audience costs for different reasons — with hawks primarily punishing inconsistency and doves punishing belligerence along with inconsistency.\nIn Figure 4, I once again illustrate the average treatment effect for each experimental condition, including an interaction effect to account for political orientation. Since we are dealing with foreign policy views, I use militant assertiveness to distinguish between hawkishness and dovishness, a measure that tests beliefs about the desirability and effectiveness of the use of force in foreign policy. This three-item scale, developed by Herrmann, Tetlock, and Visser (1999), is commonly used in experimental studies that focus on foreign policy attitudes rather than purely domestic political attitudes.\nThe results reveal that when it comes to backing down and engaging militarily, the participants act as expected. Doves apply a substantial audience cost that is made up of an inconsistency cost (49%) that censures the perceived inconsistency of the president's actions, and a belligerence cost (51%) that punishes the threats of force. Hawks, by contrast, apply a larger audience cost than doves, and this cost is made up entirely by the overwhelming aversion to the perceived inconsistency of the president's behavior (> 100%). Both hawks and doves impose audience costs, just for different reasons.\nBut how do these groups look upon the exercise of cyberattacks? Looking at Figure 4, we can see that both groups refrain from imposing any audience costs when leaders execute disruptive or degradative cyberattacks that depart from their initial promises. It appears that the use of cyberattacks moderates the extremities of the partisan divide over conducting military action. Looking at the “engage militarily” column, we can see that hawks reward leaders who engage in military action in accordance with their commitments, while doves punish leaders for their belligerence. Yet these extremes are visibly softened for both types of cyberattacks. Doves view the use of cyberattacks as less severe than conventional military engagements, and so the belligerence cost and the inconsistency cost disappear. Meanwhile, hawks are slightly less enamored of cyberattacks compared to conventional military attacks, but still find them to be sufficiently forceful to meet the initial promise and so avoid any semblance of inconsistency. Though there remain differences between these groups, cyberattacks demonstrate enormous promise in striking a middle ground that can assuage even the highly partisan perceptions of hawks and doves towards the use of force in conflict settings.\n#\nR.

    "# Robustness Tests": "Researchers have critiqued the use of hypothetical presidential figures in international relations experiments on the basis that presidential evaluations are largely driven by partisan cues that are absent in fictitious vignettes . To test the robustness of the current results in face of this critique, the survey participants were asked, as the experiment continued, to view updated conflict scenarios that depicted President Biden and Iran as the relevant actors. The alternate dependent variables in this case asked about the level of approval of President Biden's handling of the situation and measured the named President's job approval. I analyze this alternative experimental structure in Online Appendix C, finding that the same results recur under both hypothetical and realistic character representations. The study findings are also robust when excluding participants who failed any of the attention checks that were administered following the experimental treatments.\nDiscussion\nThis article proposes that the emergence of cyber capabilities has altered the nature of domestic audience costs. By taking advantage of voters' captivation with cyber power, and their understandable if erroneous belief in the operational effectiveness of cyber capabilities, leaders can back down from international threats while still appearing strong in the eyes of domestic constituents. I verify this theory through a novel experimental design, which confirms that the public views even minor cyberattacks — an objective signal of restraint — as sufficiently forceful to meet a leader's threat of force and avoid any semblance of inconsistency.\nEven with a well-founded theory backed up by robust experimental evidence, we must be careful when generalizing controlled experimental results to real-world events. Voters don't evaluate presidential performance in the artificial environment of survey experiments, and military conflict rarely abides by such clearly delineated phases of threats and responses as laid out in simplified experimental scenarios . Therefore, it behooves us to look for real-world examples of cyber audience costs that can corroborate the theory. Even if we cannot isolate specific causal mechanisms when examining historical events, it would be highly suggestive were we to find corroborating examples where minor cyberattacks were advertised as demonstrations of strength to domestic audiences, even while they were objectively used to walk back threats of escalation. I offer two cases where this behavior can be partly observed.\nA first real-world example occurred on June 20, 2019, when Iran shot down a U.S. R1-4 Global Hawk UAV . President Trump immediately and publicly threatened massive retaliatory military strikes against targets inside Iran, claiming that Iran faced “obliteration” for their acts. The threat was ignored by Iranian authorities who insisted that they would continue to shoot down any U.S. assets that entered Iranian airspace . Yet even after publicly issuing a threat, President Trump backed down from the initial threat, sufficing with a series of cyberattacks that disabled Iran's ability to track ships in the region and compromised Iran's missile defense systems .\nFrom every possible angle, it is indisputable that President Trump walked back his initial threat, setting in place the precise conditions that should give rise to critical domestic censure and generate inconsistency costs. In lieu of the promised “obliteration,” the American response de-escalated the situation by conducting a relatively minor cyberattack that signaled restraint. The cyberattack was effectively used as an off-ramp to avoid a dangerous escalation of hostilities , and indeed this cycle of hostilities came to an end.\nYet to the domestic public, the restrained cyberattack was not viewed as a capitulation. Even though the attack objectively failed to meet the severity of the initial promise to “obliterate” Iran, the cyberattack was still viewed as a signal of strength and resolve. Comparing polls taken immediately prior and following the incident, President Trump suffered no situational disapproval or lowered confidence in voters' perceptions of his ability to handle the situation in Iran (Pew Research Center 2019). In fact, the Trump administration may have exploited the secrecy that is inherently connected with cyber operations to inflate voters' beliefs about the attack's impact . By emphasizing the covertness of the attack and the ambiguity associated with the effects, media coverage of the incident likely inflated public perceptions about the severity of the muted cyberattack.\nA similar scenario played out in Israel one year later. During April 2020, Iranian hackers infiltrated the systems of an Israeli water plant (Times of Israel 2020). The hackers sought to cripple computer systems that controlled water flow and raise the level of chlorine within the water mix that was distributed to Israeli homes. The incident was thwarted before it could cause major damage, though it sent shivers down the country's spine. Israeli citizens were baying for blood, and Israeli leadership declared that the targeting of civilian infrastructure was a “red line” that warranted swift, decisive, and massive retaliation.\nYet massive retaliation did not arrive. Instead, Israel conducted a rather innocuous cyber operation targeting Iran's Shahid Rajaee port, causing a temporary traffic jam among commercial shipping vehicles . To the Iranians and to the international community who were working to avoid any military escalation, the limited Israeli cyberattack marked an end to fears of impending war. Yet to Israeli civilians, the cyberattack was trumpeted as a remarkable sign of Israeli cyber prowess and a blow to the Iranian regime . Once again, a country's leadership could have their cake and eat it too, appearing strong to domestic audiences while backing down from military escalation.\nZooming out, this study bears implications on three different aspects of conflict — the escalatory properties of cyber power, the efficacy of conflict signaling in the cyber age, and the role of public opinion in foreign affairs. First, regarding the debate over the escalatory dynamics of cyber operations, we can now add a small weight on the de-escalatory side of the scale. It was once thought that public exposure to frightening cyberattacks would cause mass demands for retaliation, generating\nescalatory pressure on leaders who must be responsive to public sentiment (Shandler, Gross, and Canetti 2022). Yet this idea has been refuted , and the evidence now suggests that public opinion adds de-escalatory pressures to cyber operations, granting leaders the ability to act with restraint without worrying about militant domestic blowback.\nSecond, what does this finding mean for the future of conflict signaling? Credibility lies at the core of international relations, and leaders have developed sophisticated methods to send signals that overcome a built-in credibility deficit — the most famous of which are costly signaling. Yet according to this paper, rivals can no longer trust purportedly costly tied-hands signals if they know that the signaling leaders possess a path of action that allows them to avoid the imposition of audience costs - even if they back down from their threat. Absent any compensatory mechanisms, the reduced effectiveness of costly signaling will insert significant uncertainty into crisis bargaining and increase skepticism about the authenticity of military threats.\nOne option to salvage this popular form of signaling may be to issue more specific and severe threats. As a rule, leaders prefer to keep their options open by issuing general threats . Yet the advent of cyber circumvention strategies may require that future threats become more specific in order to maintain their previous levels of credibility. For officials seeking to impose audience costs, they may now be required to declare that the United States Army will send ground forces from a particular unit to secure a site, or that the U.S. Air Force will launch specific missiles if a rival doesn't back down, since only highly specific guarantees can ensure that a cyber-attack will be perceived as inconsistent with the threats. Alternatively, leaders may be forced to rely on alternative signaling techniques, reweighing the form and balance of their signaling communications. While tied-hands signals are commonly conceived as being the most effective method of conveying intentions , leaders possess an arsenal of other techniques at their disposal that may now become more popular .\nLast, regarding public opinion, we gain yet another piece of evidence attesting to the consequentiality of public opinion toward cyber operations. It is easy to dismiss the relevance of public opinion when it comes to international relations. Intricate dynamics of international conflict tend to take place above the heads of regular voters, who have historically deferred to elites in such matters . Yet research consistently shows that public opinion can have a small yet meaningful effect on conflict decision-making . This is especially the case when it comes to cyber power, and leaders must be attuned to public attitudes. We already know that public\nexposure to incoming cyberattacks can manifest major political consequences (Shandler, Gross, and Canetti 2023), and now we see that the reverse is true as well — that public enthusiasm for outgoing cyber operations can generate new conflict dynamics. It is a lessen well worth learning that public opinion matters in cyber conflict.\nI end by noting several research limitations that deserve attention. Most conspicuously, the phases of the experimental game — wherein a leader issues a threat, awaits a response, and then decides how to react — is but one of many possible scenarios in which cyber operations might be deployed. This echoes a frequent critique that audience cost experiments lack ecological validity . While conceding that future research should examine the veracity of the findings under different scenarios, the core finding — that domestic audiences view cyberattacks as a demonstration of forceful leadership — is not reliant on the particular circumstances of this or any other study's experimental setup. The present study would also benefit from complementary research into how elites and foreign states view cyber operations. The ability of leaders to de-escalate conflict while still appearing strong in the eyes of domestic constituents is reliant on the fact that foreign actors will indeed view cyber operations as an act of restraint. To date, this second half of the equation is surmised on the basis of extensive observational and experimental studies that have accumulated in the literature (Jensen, Valeriano, and Whitt 2024; Lin-Greenberg 2023; Kostyuk and Gartzke 2022; Maschmeyer and Dunn Cavelty 2022; Gomez and Whyte 2020). Corroborating this component with robust experimental data would provide a fuller picture showing how different stakeholders perceived cyber capabilities, and how these perceptions are strategically consequential.\nI gratefully acknowledge the valuable feedback offered by colleagues and friends, among them: Daphna Canetti, Andres Gannon, Miguel Gomez, Erik Lin-Greenberg, Michael Gross, Nadiya Kostyuk, Harry Oppenheimer, Jordan Tama, Brandon Valeriano, and Christopher Whyte.

En exploitant la fascination des électeurs pour le cyberconflit, les dirigeants peuvent désormais désamorcer les crises en toute sécurité, sans avoir à craindre une censure nationale. Tel est l'attrait du cyberpouvoir chez le grand public que même des cyberattaques mineures, aux conséquences opérationnelles faibles, peuvent apaiser l'attente d'une puissante force militaire chez les électeurs. En pratique, cela signifie que les dirigeants qui seraient sinon tenus par des coûts d'audience nationaux peuvent y « échapper » en menant des cyberattaques à l'efficacité superficielle, mais suffisante pour les électeurs nationaux. Pour explorer la modération des pressions d'escalade nationales grâce aux cyberopérations, je mène une expérience de sondage qui demande aux participants d'évaluer les qualités de dirigeant de leur président après le déploiement d'une cyberforce ou d'une force conventionnelle. Les résultats confirment que le public considère les cyberattaques, même si elles sont éphémères et exemptes de conséquences, comme étant suffisamment vigoureuses pour répondre aux menaces de recours à la force d'un dirigeant et apaiser ses envies d'actions militaires. En proposant des exemples concrets de cette théorie dans de nombreux incidents du monde réels, je démontre que l'enthousiasme du public pour le cyberpouvoir ajoute une toute nouvelle flexibilité à la prise de décisions par temps de crise.\n## Introduction\nVoters are enthralled by cyber power. In the eyes of the public, cyber power is an almighty technological weapon that can pierce through enemy defenses — leaving a trail of destruction in its inscrutable wake (Shandler, Gross, and Canetti 2021). Cyberattacks arouse severe anxiety when turned against us , and they foster keen enthusiasm when used against our adversaries . These beliefs about cyber power are, of course, steeped in hyperbole — yet they are earnestly held by a credulous public who are buffeted by a constant din of sensationalist media reporting of cyber doom narratives (Makridis, Maschmeyer, and Smeets 2024; Lawson 2019). The disjoint between perception and reality presents political leaders with an opportunity to appear strong without taking strong action. Applying a framework of domestic audience\ncosts , I demonstrate how the allure of cyber power allows leaders to back down from explicit threats without suffering domestic censure. This finding reimagines the logic of audience costs for a digital age.\nDomestic politics and public opinion are integral features of many modern theories of international conflict . Democratic leaders pay keen attention to voters' attitudes toward war, with public opinion capable of acting as a constraint on escalation , or a spur that pushes leaders to retaliate . When it comes to cyber power, it was once thought that public engagement with cyberattacks would manifest in the latter category — adding escalatory momentum to conflict situations. So the thinking went, widespread exposure to frightening cyberattacks would lead to mass demands for retaliation, generating escalatory tailwinds and encouraging leaders to respond with any means necessary . Yet the reality turned out to be far more muted. The ambiguity and uncertainty associated with cyber threats undercut public support for retaliation (Jardine, Porter, and Shandler 2024), and predominantly subversive cyber operations failed to evoke the level of destructiveness that would generate domestic political pressure to engage in military action .\nThis article reimagines the effect of voters' captivation with cyber power, arguing that it acts as a check on conflict escalation by adding flexibility to crisis decision making. By exploiting the public enthusiasm for cyber force, leaders can safely de-escalate crisis situations without worrying about suffering domestic censure . I argue that when states conduct cyber operations, the domestic public are likely to view the use of cyberattacks as a strong sign of resolve — even if the effectiveness of the cyberattack is objectively limited. Essentially, cyber power enables leaders to de-escalate conflict without having to worry about suffering domestic censure for acting weakly or inconsistently on the international stage.\nUnderstanding the interplay between public opinion and cyber conflict requires that we descend from an international level of analysis, where most escalation debates play out, to an individual level of analysis grounded in political psychology and lay perceptions. In answering why low-cost, non-destructive cyber operations would ever be sufficient to placate hawkish domestic audiences  — the answer lies not in theories of signaling or compellence, but in theories of public opinion. Interpreting the impact of public opinion on foreign affairs requires that we interrogate the psychological and cognitive dimensions of cyber conflict, not its strategic impact.\nTo test whether cyber operations can truly temper domestic escalatory pressures, I conduct a survey experiment with a sample of American voters that asks participants to evaluate presidential leadership following the\ndeployment of cyber or conventional force. The experimental findings confirm that the public view cyberattacks — even ephemeral, inconsequential cyberattacks — as sufficiently forceful to meet a leader's threat of force and placate any public zeal for vengeance. I further verify that the results transcend partisan affiliation and recur at all levels of technological literacy.\nThese findings demonstrate how public perceptions of cyber power adds newfound flexibility to crisis decision making. By exploiting the public enthusiasm for cyber force, leaders can safely de-escalate crisis situations while maintaining a seemingly muscular foreign policy posture in the eyes of their domestic constituents. In the subsequent sections, I begin by laying out the foundations of public attitudes toward cyber conflict. After introducing the conceptual foundation, I present a novel experimental design and a set of results that verify the theory using the well-worn technique of audience-cost experiments. Last, I discuss the implications of the findings, and offer examples of how this theory has played out in real world incidents.\n## Voters' Perceptions of Cyber Power—A Terrifyingly Effective Domain\nPerceptions of cyber power are rooted in fear and emotions (Shandler, Snider, et al. 2022). A growing set of experimental works has demonstrated that voters experience mental anguish in the aftermath of cyberattacks. Exposure to even benign cyberattacks triggers spikes in stress and anxiety , threat perception , anger (Shandler, Gross, and Canetti 2022), dread , and a willingness to sacrifice civil liberties to protect against future attacks .\nThis inflated sense of threat among the public is driven by several features that are specific to cyberspace. The anonymity and mystique that are commonly associated with cyberspace exacerbate negative psychological responses, with unknown and seemingly omniscient perpetrators creating an environment of panic and helplessness (Dunn Cavelty 2012; Hansen and Nissenbaum 2009; Gomez and Whyte 2021). Moreover, the public's lack of technical sophistication when it comes to cyber threats ferments feelings of dread, a trend that is magnified by the constant exposure to seemingly irrepressible cyberattacks on a growing array of devices .\nMuch of the hyperbolic views of omnipotent and destructive cyber actors can be traced to sensationalized media coverage and popular culture depictions of cyber power . This dramatized coverage has come to be known as the “cyber doom narrative,” a teleological expectation that digital insecurity will inevitably result in mass societal collapse as our growing dependence on digital systems renders us vulnerable\nto attacks . Having been emotionally primed to experience dread, anxiety, and helplessness in the face of cyberattacks, it is no wonder that the public is liable to buy into the pervasive cultural narrative surrounding cyber threats. As a case in point, a field study of a mundane ransomware attack against a hospital in Germany revealed intense public anxiety, and a steep fall in voters' trust in their government, despite authorities' attempts to calm the jittery residents .\nWhile the public has developed a deep trepidation towards the destructive potential of cyber threats, it has, by the same logic, warmly embraced cyberattacks as an effective military offensive option. A series of experiments across multiple countries has observed a consistently high level of public enthusiasm for employing cyberattacks to respond to national security threats . Voters are enthused by the perceived capacity of cyberattacks as an operationally effective attack option that avoids placing troops in harm's way and which minimizes civilian casualties (Demarest, Jost, and Schub 2024). Even in response to the most egregious and deadly attacks, the public views cyberattacks as being a highly effective and appropriate retaliatory option (Gross, Canetti, and Vashdi 2017; Jardine et al. 2024).\nPublic beliefs about cyber power are made salient by the fact that cyber operations are now widely publicized. In the past, cyber operations were famous for taking place under a cloak of anonymity. Yet in recent years, there has been a distinct trend towards public disclosure of cyberattacks wherein authorities willingly publicize what were once secretive cyber operations . Leaders opt to openly divulge cyber operations to signal strength and prestige to external audiences , to legitimize investments in the cyber domain , and to undermine rivals' trust in technology infrastructure . This article reinforces an additional rationale for self-attribution, which is signaling strength and resolve to domestic audiences who are galvanized by displays of military force in general, and cyber-force in particular .\nIt would be understandable at this point for readers to protest that: public perceptions about cyber power are simply incorrect. I agree - public beliefs about cyber power do not necessarily match its constrained reality. Among military officials and cyber experts, the prevailing view holds that cyber power is incapable of independently effecting strategic outcomes, and that it is primarily effective as a force amplifier in coordination with conventional military forces (Valeriano, Jensen, and Maness 2018), or as an act of sub-crisis maneuvering that operates below the threshold of conflict . Nevertheless, the disjoint between public perceptions of cyber strength and the reality of its constrained effectiveness is precisely the phenomenon that creates a strategic opportunity for leaders to overcome domestic escalatory pressure.\nSpecifically, this paper targets two gaps in the cyber conflict literature that remain understudied. Much of the existing research on cyber power is dedicated to scrutinizing the objective effects and effectiveness of cyber operations. However, it is imperative that we also recognize the impact of (oftentimes distorted) perceptions about cyber power. Beliefs about cyber capabilities, even if untethered from reality, shape behavior and decision-making in real ways. Additionally, the accumulating research on public opinion and cyber power must take a final step to interrogate the strategic impact of public attitudes and beliefs. To date, mounting empirical research has demonstrated that cyberattacks roil public beliefs about international affairs and arouse strong emotional reactions . The missing step is to connect these public responses to concrete political outcomes to make the case of why public opinion matters. In the next section, we take this leap by interpreting public opinion through the prism of domestic audience costs.\n## Interpreting Cyber Operations Through the Lens of Audience Costs\nTo briefly revisit the main tenets of audience cost theory, governments manufacture domestic audience costs to credibly communicate resolve to actors in the international arena. By publicly threatening to employ military force, leaders add credibility to their signals, since both parties to the conflict are aware that domestic constituencies punish governments that say one thing and do another . The presence of audience costs transforms public threats from cheap talk into informative signals. According to the basic precepts of this theory, when a rival refuses to accede to a threat underpinned by audience costs, a leader has two principal options: to follow through on the threat and so escalate the conflict, or to back down from the threat and suffer domestic censure.\nCyber operations challenge this basic theory. What if there was an option for leaders to publicly issue a threat (an ostensibly costly signal), and yet avoid the imposition of audience costs were they to back down? I argue that cyberattacks can strike this delicate balance. To the domestic audience, wielding cyber power sends a message of strength since the public holds clear (if exaggerated) beliefs about the value and effectiveness of cyber power. Importantly, this domestically targeted message of strength is untethered to the operational effects produced by cyberattacks. As such, even minor cyberattacks with little operational or escalatory impact can placate voters' expectation of “strong” military resolve.\nINTERNATIONAL INTERACTIONS\n#\nIn Figure 1, I visualize an updated crisis bargaining model that newly incorporates cyberattacks as a distinct military option. The figure reimagines the traditional decision tree associated with audience cost theories, with the addition of a new option (D) depicted in blue. The scenario depicts a crisis between two players — who we can think of as a country (1) and a foreign rival (2). The game progresses with the country deciding at the first phase whether to publicly threaten the use of force against the foreign rival in attempt to achieve a strategic objective. If the country refrains from making any threat — then the scenario ends with them having decided to (A) stay out of the crisis. If the country issues a threat, and the foreign rival does not concede, then the onus moves back to the country to decide whether to (B) back down from their threat, or (C) follow through on their threat. Audience cost models are principally\nFigure 1. Updated crisis bargaining model with new cyberattack option.\nNote: The figure reflects the crisis scenario with expected domestic and strategic payoffs for player 1 presented under each terminal node. Ticks reflect the optimal outcomes, with no audience costs being preferred to the sufferance of audience costs, and de-escalation being preferred to military escalation. Only decision (D) leads to a situation where no audience costs are suffered and the crisis is de-escalated.\n|   | (B) Backs Down | (C) Follows Through | (D) Cyber Attack  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  Domestic Audience Cost: | Suffers Audience Cost | No Audience Cost | No Audience Cost  |\n|  Crisis Outcome: | De-Escalation | Military Escalation | De-Escalation  |\nconcerned with the difference between staying out and backing down, since publics demonstrably punish leaders who renege on their commitments.\nUntil now, these first options reflect the typical crisis bargaining model. Each of options (B) and (C) yields a negative consequence. By backing down from a threat, a government can refrain from unwanted military escalation, but will suffer a drop in public approval as their domestic constituents punish them for acting inconsistently and weakly . Alternatively, by following through and engaging in military action, a government can avoid domestic denunciation, but must prepare for a military conflagration whose consequences are unknown. We now add an additional avenue of action (D) — which depicts a government decision to conduct a cyberattack.\nBased on the above analysis describing how voters perceive cyber power, we can expect that employing a cyberattack allows the government player to mitigate any negative consequences — epitomizing a digital get out jail free card. The evidence suggests that cyber operations conducted in isolation are not a replacement for conventional warfare , and they are unlikely to engender escalatory consequences (Jensen, Valeriano, and Whitt 2024; Lin-Greenberg 2023; Libicki 2020; Fischerkeller and Harknett 2017). Yet from the perspective of the public, the cyberattack would be viewed as an act of force and a clear expression of intent. Seeing as the public view cyberspace as an effective operational domain, comparable to air and land power, launching a cyberattack meets the initial promise of force and allays any modicum of inconsistency that would give rise to audience costs. The country's leader, in this scenario, has the best of both worlds — they have backed down from a potentially escalatory conflict situation while avoiding domestic political consequences.\nAdmittedly, this logical chain of events represents just one scenario in which offensive cyber operations might be used in conflict settings. Nevertheless, this model of crisis bargaining has served to theorize about leader's decision making for decades, and there is value in overlaying cyber operations on a well-formed model of international relations. Our central focus of interest is whether benign cyber operations can effectively send signals of strength to domestic audiences. On this basis, I put forward the following testable hypothesis: cyberattacks, even those with limited operational effects, will be interpreted as a signal of strength and an effective projection of force by domestic audiences.\n## Experimental Methodology\nTo test the above theoretical framework, I employ a well-trodden pathway for experimentally examining audience costs that relies on original survey\nINTERNATIONAL INTERACTIONS\n#\nexperiments. Since Tomz (2007) first introduced a technique to empirically scrutinize the phenomenon, a series of subsequent experiments have corroborated its veracity and successfully replicated and extended the inherent logic of audience costs . This experimental approach has proven popular because selection biases mean that audience costs are difficulty to study through observational data. $^{1}$\nThe experimental design involved fielding an online survey experiment in March 2021 on a national sample of 960 Americans recruited using the Prolific Survey Panel. The study respondents represented a cross-section of the general population (mean age = 35 years, SD = 12.9). The sample's political orientation leans slightly to the left, with 56% of respondents self-identifying as progressive, while the gender distribution is exactly 50% male and female. Since the purpose of the study is to challenge the conventional logic of audience costs, the structure of the experiment draws heavily from the setup introduced in Tomz's (2007) audience cost study, which has been subject to extensive corroboration and replication. All research design and hypotheses were pre-registered prior to data collection.\nTo begin, all respondents were introduced to a scenario according to which \"a foreign country sent its military to take over a territorial region of its neighboring country.\" Respondents were then randomly assigned to one of five treatment conditions (see Table 1) that varied whether or not the U.S. president threatened to intervene and use force, and whether the president followed through on the threat in one way or another. In the stay out condition, which acts as a control group, the president pledges to stay out of the conflict, and indeed refrains from engaging in any conflict. In the other four treatment groups, respondents are told that \"the U.S. president declared that if the attacking country continues to invade, the U.S. military would immediately engage and attempt to push out the\n$^{1}$ I acknowledge a resilient school of thought that casts doubt on the empirical validity and theoretical persuasiveness of the phenomenon. One group of critics claim that artificially constructed experimental scenarios lack ecological and external validity since leaders allegedly fail to issue explicit threats,  or because fictional experiments overstate the costs that respondents impose on real leaders . Another group of critics posit that the absence of real-world crises with corresponding audience cost outcomes calls into question the external validity of this theory . While conceding the need to carefully construct experimental techniques that mimic real-world scenarios, I suggest that real-world events needn't accord precisely with the phased layout of the experimental structure for us to learn valuable lessons.\n$^{2}$ While all online survey panels have a mixed reputation regarding the representativeness of their participant pools, research has shown that the Prolific panel is superior in terms of the comprehension, attention, and honesty of responses compared to other panels (Douglas, Ewell, and Brauer 2023; Eyal et al. 2021).\n$^{3}$ The research design was approved by the Research Ethics (IRB) Committee of the authors' institution (approval # 120/21).\n#\nR. SHANDLER\nTable 1. Description of treatment conditions.\n|  Treatment condition | N | Presidential threat / declaration | Implemented action  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  Stay out | 190 | The president declared that the U.S. would stay out of the conflict. | The U.S. refrained from engaging in the conflict.  |\n|  Back down | 210 | The president threatened that the U.S. military would engage and push out the attacking country | The U.S. backed down and did not engage the attacking country in any way.  |\n|  Engage militarily (Follow Through) | 175 | The president threatened that the U.S. military would engage and push out the attacking country | Deployed grounds troops against the attacking country  |\n|  Major (degradative) cyberattack | 181 | The president threatened that the U.S. military would engage and push out the attacking country | Major degradative cyberattack that crippled the attacking force's communication networks and rendered its radar system inoperable  |\n|  Minor (disruptive) cyberattack | 204 | The president threatened that the U.S. military would engage and push out the attacking country | Minor disruptive cyberattack that slowed the attacker's digital systems and publicized sensitive personnel files.  |\nattacking country.\" In each of these four conditions, the scenario continues with the president either backing down from the threat and abstaining from any military action (back down condition), deploying ground troops against the attacking country (engage militarily condition), employing major degradative cyberattacks that operationally cripple the attacking country's military forces (major cyberattack condition), or employing minor disruptive cyberattacks that cause temporary disruptions to the attacking country's digital systems (minor cyberattack condition). The full survey instruments appear in Online Appendix A, along with balance tables and treatment randomization checks.\nConsistent with other iterations of this experimental structure, I control for outcomes by ensuring that all treatment conditions lead to the same endpoint, with the hostile state gaining  $20\\%$  of the contested territory regardless of whether the President engages or stays out . Likewise, seeing as domestic casualties are a central guiding factor in military approval, I control for this by ensuring that the United States experiences zero casualties in any scenario.4\nFollowing exposure to one of the conflict conditions, which was reinforced through a series of attention checks, I measured the dependent variable of interest by asking participants whether they approved or disapproved of the way the President handled the situation on a seven-point scale. Additionally, I collected data on respondents' dispositional\nINTERNATIONAL INTERACTIONS\n#\ncharacteristics such as militant assertiveness using a scale developed by Herrmann, Tetlock, and Visser (1999), international trust via a measured produced by Brewer (2004), and political ideology using the standard measure from the American National Election Studies. I further collected a comprehensive battery of demographic characteristics, including gender, employment, age, level of education, and technological literacy. Information on the scales and sources of all collected measures appears in the Online Appendix.\n# Results\nTo assess how use of force decisions give rise to audience costs, Figure 2 reveals the average treatment effect of each experimental condition on presidential approval. The average treatment effect consists of a regression coefficient estimate for each proxy treatment group when compared to the baseline \"Stay Out\" condition. $^{6}$  For this first analysis, I combine the two cyberattacks treatments into one overarching cyber group to construct a general cyber effect.\nA number of results immediately leap out. First, similarly to all audience cost experiments, we can see that the typical audience cost effect (conceptualized as the effect of backing down from a commitment compared to staying out of the conflict) is negative, large, and statistically significant  $(\\beta = -1.622, p &lt; .000)$ . This finding rehashes the central tenet of domestic audience costs, showing that voters will punish a leader for issuing a threat to use force and then backing down. Likewise, we can be encouraged by the fact that the level of support for engaging militarily (and not acting inconsistently) also acts as expected, with no statistically significant difference between military engagement and staying out of the conflict  $(\\beta = .151, p = \\mathrm{n.s.})$ . Essentially, voters are looking for consistency; they will not punish the president for evincing a desire to stay out of the conflict and doing so, nor will they punish the president for making a threat and following through. Only backing down from an explicit threat leads to domestic censure.\nWhen turning to our primary variable of interest, the effect of conducting cyberattacks, we can observe a slight but statistically significant increase in presidential approval following a cyberattack, compared to the\n6The full regression output appears in Online Appendix E.\n7The belligerence cost effect is necessarily smaller than the audience cost effect, since inconsistent behavior makes up the majority of an audience cost . The public applies a belligerence cost due to disapproval of aggressive behavior, even if it is consistent with past promises. In the presented results, engaging militarily did not lead to any statistically significant decrease in public approval. This is consistent with past findings by Lin-Greenberg (2019) and Croco, Hanmer, and McDonald (2021), and contrasts with Kertzer and Brutger (2016) who identified a slight but statistically significant belligerence cost.\n#\nR. SHANDLER\nFigure 2. Situational approval by experimental condition.\nNote: This plot depicts estimates of the treatment effect of each experimental condition on presidential approval relative to the stay out condition.

Bars represent  $95\\%$  confidence intervals and dots depict estimate means.\nbaseline stay out condition ( $\\beta = .360$ ,  $p &lt; .019$ ). According to our conceptualization of this treatment, cyberattacks constitute a repudiation of the initial promise, almost akin to backing down. The president had declared that the U.S. military would actively engage and push out the attacking country's forces. Yet far from actualizing this commitment, the president contented with a single barrage of cyberattacks against the attacking country's forces that merely publicized sensitive information or targeted its radar systems. Neither action represents a level of military engagement sufficient to \"push back the attacking forces,\" and the rival country would certainly view such an attack as a token and de-escalatory signal. Yet even though this path of action represents the kind of inconsistency that should evoke domestic disapproval — as with the back down condition — the public actually reports a slight increase in approval. As theorized, it appears that that a leader can back down from a threat without suffering domestic\ncensure simply by deploying militarily trivial cyber operations that appear forceful to domestic constituents.\nA fact that adds credibility to this reading of the results is the fact that the public keenly distinguishes between greater and lesser military action. Lin-Greenberg (2019) found that leaders who committed to full military action can partially mitigate audience costs by deploying lesser attack techniques such as air-strikes or sanctions. Lin-Greenberg's alternative attack options fell somewhere in between realizing the full-throated military threat and completely backing down — and the public was able to discern this important distinction leading to lowered but not entirely mitigated audience costs. Yet in the case of cyberattacks, we don't see merely reduced audience costs, we see an actual increase in approval ratings. The study respondents viewed the cyberattack as a kept promise, even though its effectiveness is objectively limited. This accords with research by Shandler, Gross, and Canetti (2021) who revealed a strong public enthusiasm for cyber warfare on the basis of its being perceived as an operationally effective military option that minimizes friendly and collateral deaths.\n### Breaking Down Cyberattacks—Degradative Versus Disruptive Strikes\nTo add additional nuance to the analyses, and to avoid the critique of earlier audience cost experiments that oversimplified the choices available to leaders, I break down cyberattacks into degradative (major) cyberattacks and disruptive (minor) cyberattacks. Disruptive cyber techniques differ from degradative attacks in the permanence, the destructiveness, and the operational effectiveness of the attack. We could expect that the rarer, and more degradative cyberattacks are far likelier to be construed by the public as meeting the leader's initial promise of “military engagement that pushes back the attackers' forces.” Disruptive cyberattacks, by contrast, should not even come close to meeting this promise and should be viewed as wholly equivalent to backing down.\nIn Figure 3, I again illustrate the average treatment effect for each experimental condition, though this time dividing the previously uniform cyberattacks into degradative and disruptive cyberattacks. Furthermore, I add an interaction effect to account for the respondents' level of technological literacy. This heterogeneous factor is crucial for the subsequent analysis since research has consistently shown that people's level of digital sophistication guides their perceptions of the efficacy of cyber threats and operations .\n#\nR. SHANDLER\nFigure 3. Situational approval by experimental condition—conditional on technological literacy.\nNote: This plot depicts estimates of the treatment effect of each experimental condition on presidential approval relative to the stay out condition. Estimates are based on an OLS model with interaction effects between tech literacy and each proxy experimental condition. Bars represent  $95\\%$  confidence intervals and dots depict estimate means.\nFigure 3 reveals that no audience costs are levied for either degradative or disruptive attacks. In essence, the public perceives even minor cyberattacks that have no lasting operational benefits as meeting the commitment of leaders to \"push back an attacker.\" Critically, we can see that the wide-ranging approval of cyberattacks is not contingent on technological literacy. One would think that high-tech literacy respondents would be more aware of the limited effects produced by cyber operations and that this group would recognize that minor, disruptive cyber operations do not meet the promise of a strong military response — but even high-tech literacy respondents refrained from imposing audience costs on leaders who deployed cyberattacks in lieu of conventional force. Both technologically literate and illiterate respondents refrain from punishing a leader for employing cyber operations, granting presidential flexibility across the board.\nHeterogeneous Effects: Hawks and Doves\nAs a third analysis, I examine whether the cyber pathway of avoiding audience costs holds when viewed through the lens of political orientation. I take this step since studies have identified that the strength of audience costs is highly conditional upon political orientation . Kertzer and Brutger (2016) even found that hawks and doves apply audience costs for different reasons — with hawks primarily punishing inconsistency and doves punishing belligerence along with inconsistency.\nIn Figure 4, I once again illustrate the average treatment effect for each experimental condition, including an interaction effect to account for political orientation. Since we are dealing with foreign policy views, I use militant assertiveness to distinguish between hawkishness and dovishness, a measure that tests beliefs about the desirability and effectiveness of the use of force in foreign policy. This three-item scale, developed by Herrmann, Tetlock, and Visser (1999), is commonly used in experimental studies that focus on foreign policy attitudes rather than purely domestic political attitudes.\nThe results reveal that when it comes to backing down and engaging militarily, the participants act as expected. Doves apply a substantial audience cost that is made up of an inconsistency cost (49%) that censures the perceived inconsistency of the president's actions, and a belligerence cost (51%) that punishes the threats of force. Hawks, by contrast, apply a larger audience cost than doves, and this cost is made up entirely by the overwhelming aversion to the perceived inconsistency of the president's behavior (> 100%). Both hawks and doves impose audience costs, just for different reasons.\nBut how do these groups look upon the exercise of cyberattacks? Looking at Figure 4, we can see that both groups refrain from imposing any audience costs when leaders execute disruptive or degradative cyberattacks that depart from their initial promises. It appears that the use of cyberattacks moderates the extremities of the partisan divide over conducting military action. Looking at the “engage militarily” column, we can see that hawks reward leaders who engage in military action in accordance with their commitments, while doves punish leaders for their belligerence. Yet these extremes are visibly softened for both types of cyberattacks. Doves view the use of cyberattacks as less severe than conventional military engagements, and so the belligerence cost and the inconsistency cost disappear. Meanwhile, hawks are slightly less enamored of cyberattacks compared to conventional military attacks, but still find them to be sufficiently forceful to meet the initial promise and so avoid any semblance of inconsistency. Though there remain differences between these groups, cyberattacks demonstrate enormous promise in striking a middle ground that can assuage even the highly partisan perceptions of hawks and doves towards the use of force in conflict settings.\n#\nR. SHANDLER\nFigure 4. Situational approval by experimental condition—conditional on militant assertiveness (Hawks vs. Doves).\nNote: This plot depicts estimates of the treatment effect of each experimental condition on presidential approval relative to the stay out condition. Estimates are based on an OLS model with interaction effects between tech literacy and each proxy experimental condition. Bars represent  $95\\%$  confidence intervals and dots depict estimate means.\n# Robustness Tests\nResearchers have critiqued the use of hypothetical presidential figures in international relations experiments on the basis that presidential evaluations are largely driven by partisan cues that are absent in fictitious vignettes . To test the robustness of the current results in face of this critique, the survey participants were asked, as the experiment continued, to view updated conflict scenarios that depicted President Biden and Iran as the relevant actors. The alternate dependent variables in this case asked about the level of approval of President Biden's handling of the situation and measured the named President's job approval. I analyze this alternative experimental structure in Online Appendix C, finding that the same results recur under both hypothetical and realistic character representations. The study findings are also robust when excluding participants who failed any of the attention checks that were administered following the experimental treatments.\nDiscussion\nThis article proposes that the emergence of cyber capabilities has altered the nature of domestic audience costs. By taking advantage of voters' captivation with cyber power, and their understandable if erroneous belief in the operational effectiveness of cyber capabilities, leaders can back down from international threats while still appearing strong in the eyes of domestic constituents. I verify this theory through a novel experimental design, which confirms that the public views even minor cyberattacks — an objective signal of restraint — as sufficiently forceful to meet a leader's threat of force and avoid any semblance of inconsistency.\nEven with a well-founded theory backed up by robust experimental evidence, we must be careful when generalizing controlled experimental results to real-world events. Voters don't evaluate presidential performance in the artificial environment of survey experiments, and military conflict rarely abides by such clearly delineated phases of threats and responses as laid out in simplified experimental scenarios . Therefore, it behooves us to look for real-world examples of cyber audience costs that can corroborate the theory. Even if we cannot isolate specific causal mechanisms when examining historical events, it would be highly suggestive were we to find corroborating examples where minor cyberattacks were advertised as demonstrations of strength to domestic audiences, even while they were objectively used to walk back threats of escalation. I offer two cases where this behavior can be partly observed.\nA first real-world example occurred on June 20, 2019, when Iran shot down a U.S. R1-4 Global Hawk UAV . President Trump immediately and publicly threatened massive retaliatory military strikes against targets inside Iran, claiming that Iran faced “obliteration” for their acts. The threat was ignored by Iranian authorities who insisted that they would continue to shoot down any U.S. assets that entered Iranian airspace . Yet even after publicly issuing a threat, President Trump backed down from the initial threat, sufficing with a series of cyberattacks that disabled Iran's ability to track ships in the region and compromised Iran's missile defense systems .\nFrom every possible angle, it is indisputable that President Trump walked back his initial threat, setting in place the precise conditions that should give rise to critical domestic censure and generate inconsistency costs. In lieu of the promised “obliteration,” the American response de-escalated the situation by conducting a relatively minor cyberattack that signaled restraint. The cyberattack was effectively used as an off-ramp to avoid a dangerous escalation of hostilities , and indeed this cycle of hostilities came to an end.\nYet to the domestic public, the restrained cyberattack was not viewed as a capitulation. Even though the attack objectively failed to meet the severity of the initial promise to “obliterate” Iran, the cyberattack was still viewed as a signal of strength and resolve. Comparing polls taken immediately prior and following the incident, President Trump suffered no situational disapproval or lowered confidence in voters' perceptions of his ability to handle the situation in Iran (Pew Research Center 2019). In fact, the Trump administration may have exploited the secrecy that is inherently connected with cyber operations to inflate voters' beliefs about the attack's impact . By emphasizing the covertness of the attack and the ambiguity associated with the effects, media coverage of the incident likely inflated public perceptions about the severity of the muted cyberattack.\nA similar scenario played out in Israel one year later. During April 2020, Iranian hackers infiltrated the systems of an Israeli water plant (Times of Israel 2020). The hackers sought to cripple computer systems that controlled water flow and raise the level of chlorine within the water mix that was distributed to Israeli homes. The incident was thwarted before it could cause major damage, though it sent shivers down the country's spine. Israeli citizens were baying for blood, and Israeli leadership declared that the targeting of civilian infrastructure was a “red line” that warranted swift, decisive, and massive retaliation.\nYet massive retaliation did not arrive. Instead, Israel conducted a rather innocuous cyber operation targeting Iran's Shahid Rajaee port, causing a temporary traffic jam among commercial shipping vehicles . To the Iranians and to the international community who were working to avoid any military escalation, the limited Israeli cyberattack marked an end to fears of impending war. Yet to Israeli civilians, the cyberattack was trumpeted as a remarkable sign of Israeli cyber prowess and a blow to the Iranian regime . Once again, a country's leadership could have their cake and eat it too, appearing strong to domestic audiences while backing down from military escalation.\nZooming out, this study bears implications on three different aspects of conflict — the escalatory properties of cyber power, the efficacy of conflict signaling in the cyber age, and the role of public opinion in foreign affairs. First, regarding the debate over the escalatory dynamics of cyber operations, we can now add a small weight on the de-escalatory side of the scale. It was once thought that public exposure to frightening cyberattacks would cause mass demands for retaliation, generating\nescalatory pressure on leaders who must be responsive to public sentiment (Shandler, Gross, and Canetti 2022). Yet this idea has been refuted , and the evidence now suggests that public opinion adds de-escalatory pressures to cyber operations, granting leaders the ability to act with restraint without worrying about militant domestic blowback.\nSecond, what does this finding mean for the future of conflict signaling? Credibility lies at the core of international relations, and leaders have developed sophisticated methods to send signals that overcome a built-in credibility deficit — the most famous of which are costly signaling. Yet according to this paper, rivals can no longer trust purportedly costly tied-hands signals if they know that the signaling leaders possess a path of action that allows them to avoid the imposition of audience costs - even if they back down from their threat. Absent any compensatory mechanisms, the reduced effectiveness of costly signaling will insert significant uncertainty into crisis bargaining and increase skepticism about the authenticity of military threats.\nOne option to salvage this popular form of signaling may be to issue more specific and severe threats. As a rule, leaders prefer to keep their options open by issuing general threats . Yet the advent of cyber circumvention strategies may require that future threats become more specific in order to maintain their previous levels of credibility. For officials seeking to impose audience costs, they may now be required to declare that the United States Army will send ground forces from a particular unit to secure a site, or that the U.S. Air Force will launch specific missiles if a rival doesn't back down, since only highly specific guarantees can ensure that a cyber-attack will be perceived as inconsistent with the threats. Alternatively, leaders may be forced to rely on alternative signaling techniques, reweighing the form and balance of their signaling communications. While tied-hands signals are commonly conceived as being the most effective method of conveying intentions , leaders possess an arsenal of other techniques at their disposal that may now become more popular .\nLast, regarding public opinion, we gain yet another piece of evidence attesting to the consequentiality of public opinion toward cyber operations. It is easy to dismiss the relevance of public opinion when it comes to international relations. Intricate dynamics of international conflict tend to take place above the heads of regular voters, who have historically deferred to elites in such matters . Yet research consistently shows that public opinion can have a small yet meaningful effect on conflict decision-making . This is especially the case when it comes to cyber power, and leaders must be attuned to public attitudes. We already know that public\nexposure to incoming cyberattacks can manifest major political consequences (Shandler, Gross, and Canetti 2023), and now we see that the reverse is true as well — that public enthusiasm for outgoing cyber operations can generate new conflict dynamics. It is a lessen well worth learning that public opinion matters in cyber conflict.\nI end by noting several research limitations that deserve attention. Most conspicuously, the phases of the experimental game — wherein a leader issues a threat, awaits a response, and then decides how to react — is but one of many possible scenarios in which cyber operations might be deployed. This echoes a frequent critique that audience cost experiments lack ecological validity . While conceding that future research should examine the veracity of the findings under different scenarios, the core finding — that domestic audiences view cyberattacks as a demonstration of forceful leadership — is not reliant on the particular circumstances of this or any other study's experimental setup. The present study would also benefit from complementary research into how elites and foreign states view cyber operations. The ability of leaders to de-escalate conflict while still appearing strong in the eyes of domestic constituents is reliant on the fact that foreign actors will indeed view cyber operations as an act of restraint. To date, this second half of the equation is surmised on the basis of extensive observational and experimental studies that have accumulated in the literature (Jensen, Valeriano, and Whitt 2024; Lin-Greenberg 2023; Kostyuk and Gartzke 2022; Maschmeyer and Dunn Cavelty 2022; Gomez and Whyte 2020). Corroborating this component with robust experimental data would provide a fuller picture showing how different stakeholders perceived cyber capabilities, and how these perceptions are strategically consequential.\nI gratefully acknowledge the valuable feedback offered by colleagues and friends, among them: Daphna Canetti, Andres Gannon, Miguel Gomez, Erik Lin-Greenberg, Michael Gross, Nadiya Kostyuk, Harry Oppenheimer, Jordan Tama, Brandon Valeriano, and Christopher Whyte. The paper benefited greatly from comments offered at the 2023 Cyber Escalation in Conflict workshop hosted by Erik Gartzke, Jelena Vićić, and Gil Baram, and at the ISA 2022 Annual Conference. I appreciate the input of the journal editors and reviewers.\n## Disclosure statement\nNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).\nINTERNATIONAL INTERACTIONS\n#",

En exploitant la fascination des électeurs pour le cyberconflit, les dirigeants peuvent désormais désamorcer les crises en toute sécurité, sans avoir à craindre une censure nationale. Tel est l'attrait du cyberpouvoir chez le grand public que même des cyberattaques mineures, aux conséquences opérationnelles faibles, peuvent apaiser l'attente d'une puissante force militaire chez les électeurs. En pratique, cela signifie que les dirigeants qui seraient sinon tenus par des coûts d'audience nationaux peuvent y « échapper » en menant des cyberattaques à l'efficacité superficielle, mais suffisante pour les électeurs nationaux. Pour explorer la modération des pressions d'escalade nationales grâce aux cyberopérations, je mène une expérience de sondage qui demande aux participants d'évaluer les qualités de dirigeant de leur président après le déploiement d'une cyberforce ou d'une force conventionnelle. Les résultats confirment que le public considère les cyberattaques, même si elles sont éphémères et exemptes de conséquences, comme étant suffisamment vigoureuses pour répondre aux menaces de recours à la force d'un dirigeant et apaiser ses envies d'actions militaires. En proposant des exemples concrets de cette théorie dans de nombreux incidents du monde réels, je démontre que l'enthousiasme du public pour le cyberpouvoir ajoute une toute nouvelle flexibilité à la prise de décisions par temps de crise.\n## Introduction\nVoters are enthralled by cyber power. In the eyes of the public, cyber power is an almighty technological weapon that can pierce through enemy defenses — leaving a trail of destruction in its inscrutable wake (Shandler, Gross, and Canetti 2021). Cyberattacks arouse severe anxiety when turned against us (Backhaus et al. 2020), and they foster keen enthusiasm when used against our adversaries (Leal and Musgrave 2023). These beliefs about cyber power are, of course, steeped in hyperbole — yet they are earnestly held by a credulous public who are buffeted by a constant din of sensationalist media reporting of cyber doom narratives (Makridis, Maschmeyer, and Smeets 2024; Lawson 2019). The disjoint between perception and reality presents political leaders with an opportunity to appear strong without taking strong action. Applying a framework of domestic audience\ncosts (Fearon 1994), I demonstrate how the allure of cyber power allows leaders to back down from explicit threats without suffering domestic censure. This finding reimagines the logic of audience costs for a digital age.\nDomestic politics and public opinion are integral features of many modern theories of international conflict (Kertzer 2023, 2018). Democratic leaders pay keen attention to voters' attitudes toward war, with public opinion capable of acting as a constraint on escalation (Baum and Potter 2015; Gelpi 2017), or a spur that pushes leaders to retaliate (Ribar 2021; Dafoe et al. 2022). When it comes to cyber power, it was once thought that public engagement with cyberattacks would manifest in the latter category — adding escalatory momentum to conflict situations. So the thinking went, widespread exposure to frightening cyberattacks would lead to mass demands for retaliation, generating escalatory tailwinds and encouraging leaders to respond with any means necessary (Leal and Musgrave 2023; Shandler, Gross, and Canetti 2022). Yet the reality turned out to be far more muted. The ambiguity and uncertainty associated with cyber threats undercut public support for retaliation (Jardine, Porter, and Shandler 2024), and predominantly subversive cyber operations failed to evoke the level of destructiveness that would generate domestic political pressure to engage in military action (Maschmeyer 2021, 2023).\nThis article reimagines the effect of voters' captivation with cyber power, arguing that it acts as a check on conflict escalation by adding flexibility to crisis decision making. By exploiting the public enthusiasm for cyber force, leaders can safely de-escalate crisis situations without worrying about suffering domestic censure (Lonergan and Lonergan 2022). I argue that when states conduct cyber operations, the domestic public are likely to view the use of cyberattacks as a strong sign of resolve — even if the effectiveness of the cyberattack is objectively limited. Essentially, cyber power enables leaders to de-escalate conflict without having to worry about suffering domestic censure for acting weakly or inconsistently on the international stage.\nUnderstanding the interplay between public opinion and cyber conflict requires that we descend from an international level of analysis, where most escalation debates play out, to an individual level of analysis grounded in political psychology and lay perceptions. In answering why low-cost, non-destructive cyber operations would ever be sufficient to placate hawkish domestic audiences (Yoder 2022) — the answer lies not in theories of signaling or compellence, but in theories of public opinion. Interpreting the impact of public opinion on foreign affairs requires that we interrogate the psychological and cognitive dimensions of cyber conflict, not its strategic impact.\nTo test whether cyber operations can truly temper domestic escalatory pressures, I conduct a survey experiment with a sample of American voters that asks participants to evaluate presidential leadership following the\ndeployment of cyber or conventional force. The experimental findings confirm that the public view cyberattacks — even ephemeral, inconsequential cyberattacks — as sufficiently forceful to meet a leader's threat of force and placate any public zeal for vengeance. I further verify that the results transcend partisan affiliation and recur at all levels of technological literacy.\nThese findings demonstrate how public perceptions of cyber power adds newfound flexibility to crisis decision making. By exploiting the public enthusiasm for cyber force, leaders can safely de-escalate crisis situations while maintaining a seemingly muscular foreign policy posture in the eyes of their domestic constituents. In the subsequent sections, I begin by laying out the foundations of public attitudes toward cyber conflict. After introducing the conceptual foundation, I present a novel experimental design and a set of results that verify the theory using the well-worn technique of audience-cost experiments. Last, I discuss the implications of the findings, and offer examples of how this theory has played out in real world incidents.\n## Voters' Perceptions of Cyber Power—A Terrifyingly Effective Domain\nPerceptions of cyber power are rooted in fear and emotions (Shandler, Snider, et al. 2022). A growing set of experimental works has demonstrated that voters experience mental anguish in the aftermath of cyberattacks. Exposure to even benign cyberattacks triggers spikes in stress and anxiety (Backhaus et al. 2020), threat perception (Snider et al. 2021; Gross et al. 2017), anger (Shandler, Gross, and Canetti 2022), dread (Gomez and Villar 2018; Shandler and Gomez 2023), and a willingness to sacrifice civil liberties to protect against future attacks (Snider et al. 2025; Snider et al. 2021).\nThis inflated sense of threat among the public is driven by several features that are specific to cyberspace. The anonymity and mystique that are commonly associated with cyberspace exacerbate negative psychological responses, with unknown and seemingly omniscient perpetrators creating an environment of panic and helplessness (Dunn Cavelty 2012; Hansen and Nissenbaum 2009; Gomez and Whyte 2021). Moreover, the public's lack of technical sophistication when it comes to cyber threats ferments feelings of dread, a trend that is magnified by the constant exposure to seemingly irrepressible cyberattacks on a growing array of devices (Gomez and Villar 2018; Bada and Nurse 2020; McDermott 2019).\nMuch of the hyperbolic views of omnipotent and destructive cyber actors can be traced to sensationalized media coverage and popular culture depictions of cyber power (Lawson 2019; Dunn Cavelty 2019). This dramatized coverage has come to be known as the “cyber doom narrative,” a teleological expectation that digital insecurity will inevitably result in mass societal collapse as our growing dependence on digital systems renders us vulnerable\nto attacks (Gomez and Whyte 2021; Hansen and Nissenbaum 2009). Having been emotionally primed to experience dread, anxiety, and helplessness in the face of cyberattacks, it is no wonder that the public is liable to buy into the pervasive cultural narrative surrounding cyber threats. As a case in point, a field study of a mundane ransomware attack against a hospital in Germany revealed intense public anxiety, and a steep fall in voters' trust in their government, despite authorities' attempts to calm the jittery residents (Shandler and Gomez 2023; Gomez and Shandler 2024).\nWhile the public has developed a deep trepidation towards the destructive potential of cyber threats, it has, by the same logic, warmly embraced cyberattacks as an effective military offensive option. A series of experiments across multiple countries has observed a consistently high level of public enthusiasm for employing cyberattacks to respond to national security threats (Leal and Musgrave 2023). Voters are enthused by the perceived capacity of cyberattacks as an operationally effective attack option that avoids placing troops in harm's way and which minimizes civilian casualties (Demarest, Jost, and Schub 2024). Even in response to the most egregious and deadly attacks, the public views cyberattacks as being a highly effective and appropriate retaliatory option (Gross, Canetti, and Vashdi 2017; Jardine et al. 2024).\nPublic beliefs about cyber power are made salient by the fact that cyber operations are now widely publicized. In the past, cyber operations were famous for taking place under a cloak of anonymity. Yet in recent years, there has been a distinct trend towards public disclosure of cyberattacks wherein authorities willingly publicize what were once secretive cyber operations (Baram 2023; Baram 2022; Poznansky and Perkoski 2018; Egloff and Smeets 2023). Leaders opt to openly divulge cyber operations to signal strength and prestige to external audiences (Egloff and Smeets 2023; Smeets and Lin 2018), to legitimize investments in the cyber domain (Jacobsen and Ringsmose 2017), and to undermine rivals' trust in technology infrastructure (Jacobsen and Ringsmose 2017). This article reinforces an additional rationale for self-attribution, which is signaling strength and resolve to domestic audiences who are galvanized by displays of military force in general, and cyber-force in particular (Shandler et al. 2021).\nIt would be understandable at this point for readers to protest that: public perceptions about cyber power are simply incorrect. I agree - public beliefs about cyber power do not necessarily match its constrained reality. Among military officials and cyber experts, the prevailing view holds that cyber power is incapable of independently effecting strategic outcomes, and that it is primarily effective as a force amplifier in coordination with conventional military forces (Valeriano, Jensen, and Maness 2018), or as an act of sub-crisis maneuvering that operates below the threshold of conflict (Maschmeyer 2021; Maschmeyer 2023; Valeriano and Maness 2014;\ncf. Demarest, Jost, and Schub 2024). Nevertheless, the disjoint between public perceptions of cyber strength and the reality of its constrained effectiveness is precisely the phenomenon that creates a strategic opportunity for leaders to overcome domestic escalatory pressure.\nSpecifically, this paper targets two gaps in the cyber conflict literature that remain understudied. Much of the existing research on cyber power is dedicated to scrutinizing the objective effects and effectiveness of cyber operations. However, it is imperative that we also recognize the impact of (oftentimes distorted) perceptions about cyber power. Beliefs about cyber capabilities, even if untethered from reality, shape behavior and decision-making in real ways. Additionally, the accumulating research on public opinion and cyber power must take a final step to interrogate the strategic impact of public attitudes and beliefs. To date, mounting empirical research has demonstrated that cyberattacks roil public beliefs about international affairs and arouse strong emotional reactions (Shandler and Canetti 2024). The missing step is to connect these public responses to concrete political outcomes to make the case of why public opinion matters. In the next section, we take this leap by interpreting public opinion through the prism of domestic audience costs.\n## Interpreting Cyber Operations Through the Lens of Audience Costs\nTo briefly revisit the main tenets of audience cost theory, governments manufacture domestic audience costs to credibly communicate resolve to actors in the international arena. By publicly threatening to employ military force, leaders add credibility to their signals, since both parties to the conflict are aware that domestic constituencies punish governments that say one thing and do another (Fearon 1994; Smith 1998; Baum 2004; Slantchev 2006; Weeks 2008). The presence of audience costs transforms public threats from cheap talk into informative signals. According to the basic precepts of this theory, when a rival refuses to accede to a threat underpinned by audience costs, a leader has two principal options: to follow through on the threat and so escalate the conflict, or to back down from the threat and suffer domestic censure.\nCyber operations challenge this basic theory. What if there was an option for leaders to publicly issue a threat (an ostensibly costly signal), and yet avoid the imposition of audience costs were they to back down? I argue that cyberattacks can strike this delicate balance. To the domestic audience, wielding cyber power sends a message of strength since the public holds clear (if exaggerated) beliefs about the value and effectiveness of cyber power. Importantly, this domestically targeted message of strength is untethered to the operational effects produced by cyberattacks. As such, even minor cyberattacks with little operational or escalatory impact can placate voters' expectation of “strong” military resolve.\nINTERNATIONAL INTERACTIONS\n#\nIn Figure 1, I visualize an updated crisis bargaining model that newly incorporates cyberattacks as a distinct military option. The figure reimagines the traditional decision tree associated with audience cost theories, with the addition of a new option (D) depicted in blue. The scenario depicts a crisis between two players — who we can think of as a country (1) and a foreign rival (2). The game progresses with the country deciding at the first phase whether to publicly threaten the use of force against the foreign rival in attempt to achieve a strategic objective. If the country refrains from making any threat — then the scenario ends with them having decided to (A) stay out of the crisis. If the country issues a threat, and the foreign rival does not concede, then the onus moves back to the country to decide whether to (B) back down from their threat, or (C) follow through on their threat. Audience cost models are principally\nFigure 1. Updated crisis bargaining model with new cyberattack option.\nNote: The figure reflects the crisis scenario with expected domestic and strategic payoffs for player 1 presented under each terminal node. Ticks reflect the optimal outcomes, with no audience costs being preferred to the sufferance of audience costs, and de-escalation being preferred to military escalation. Only decision (D) leads to a situation where no audience costs are suffered and the crisis is de-escalated.\n|   | (B) Backs Down | (C) Follows Through | (D) Cyber Attack  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  Domestic Audience Cost: | Suffers Audience Cost | No Audience Cost | No Audience Cost  |\n|  Crisis Outcome: | De-Escalation | Military Escalation | De-Escalation  |\nconcerned with the difference between staying out and backing down, since publics demonstrably punish leaders who renege on their commitments.\nUntil now, these first options reflect the typical crisis bargaining model. Each of options (B) and (C) yields a negative consequence. By backing down from a threat, a government can refrain from unwanted military escalation, but will suffer a drop in public approval as their domestic constituents punish them for acting inconsistently and weakly (Kertzer and Brutger 2016). Alternatively, by following through and engaging in military action, a government can avoid domestic denunciation, but must prepare for a military conflagration whose consequences are unknown. We now add an additional avenue of action (D) — which depicts a government decision to conduct a cyberattack.\nBased on the above analysis describing how voters perceive cyber power, we can expect that employing a cyberattack allows the government player to mitigate any negative consequences — epitomizing a digital get out jail free card. The evidence suggests that cyber operations conducted in isolation are not a replacement for conventional warfare (Kostyuk and Gartzke 2022), and they are unlikely to engender escalatory consequences (Jensen, Valeriano, and Whitt 2024; Lin-Greenberg 2023; Libicki 2020; Fischerkeller and Harknett 2017). Yet from the perspective of the public, the cyberattack would be viewed as an act of force and a clear expression of intent. Seeing as the public view cyberspace as an effective operational domain, comparable to air and land power, launching a cyberattack meets the initial promise of force and allays any modicum of inconsistency that would give rise to audience costs. The country's leader, in this scenario, has the best of both worlds — they have backed down from a potentially escalatory conflict situation while avoiding domestic political consequences.\nAdmittedly, this logical chain of events represents just one scenario in which offensive cyber operations might be used in conflict settings. Nevertheless, this model of crisis bargaining has served to theorize about leader's decision making for decades, and there is value in overlaying cyber operations on a well-formed model of international relations. Our central focus of interest is whether benign cyber operations can effectively send signals of strength to domestic audiences. On this basis, I put forward the following testable hypothesis: cyberattacks, even those with limited operational effects, will be interpreted as a signal of strength and an effective projection of force by domestic audiences.\n## Experimental Methodology\nTo test the above theoretical framework, I employ a well-trodden pathway for experimentally examining audience costs that relies on original survey\nINTERNATIONAL INTERACTIONS\n#\nexperiments. Since Tomz (2007) first introduced a technique to empirically scrutinize the phenomenon, a series of subsequent experiments have corroborated its veracity and successfully replicated and extended the inherent logic of audience costs (Hoffman et al. 2009; Trager and Vavreck 2011; Levendusky and Horowitz 2012; Davies and Johns 2013; Chaudoin 2014; Kertzer and Brutger 2016; Lin-Greenberg 2019). This experimental approach has proven popular because selection biases mean that audience costs are difficulty to study through observational data. $^{1}$\nThe experimental design involved fielding an online survey experiment in March 2021 on a national sample of 960 Americans recruited using the Prolific Survey Panel. The study respondents represented a cross-section of the general population (mean age = 35 years, SD = 12.9). The sample's political orientation leans slightly to the left, with 56% of respondents self-identifying as progressive, while the gender distribution is exactly 50% male and female. Since the purpose of the study is to challenge the conventional logic of audience costs, the structure of the experiment draws heavily from the setup introduced in Tomz's (2007) audience cost study, which has been subject to extensive corroboration and replication. All research design and hypotheses were pre-registered prior to data collection.\nTo begin, all respondents were introduced to a scenario according to which \"a foreign country sent its military to take over a territorial region of its neighboring country.\" Respondents were then randomly assigned to one of five treatment conditions (see Table 1) that varied whether or not the U.S. president threatened to intervene and use force, and whether the president followed through on the threat in one way or another. In the stay out condition, which acts as a control group, the president pledges to stay out of the conflict, and indeed refrains from engaging in any conflict. In the other four treatment groups, respondents are told that \"the U.S. president declared that if the attacking country continues to invade, the U.S. military would immediately engage and attempt to push out the\n$^{1}$ I acknowledge a resilient school of thought that casts doubt on the empirical validity and theoretical persuasiveness of the phenomenon. One group of critics claim that artificially constructed experimental scenarios lack ecological and external validity since leaders allegedly fail to issue explicit threats, (Snyder and Borghard 2011) or because fictional experiments overstate the costs that respondents impose on real leaders (Croco et al. 2021; Kurizaki and Whang 2015). Another group of critics posit that the absence of real-world crises with corresponding audience cost outcomes calls into question the external validity of this theory (Trachtenberg 2012; Gartzke and Lupu 2012). While conceding the need to carefully construct experimental techniques that mimic real-world scenarios, I suggest that real-world events needn't accord precisely with the phased layout of the experimental structure for us to learn valuable lessons.\n$^{2}$ While all online survey panels have a mixed reputation regarding the representativeness of their participant pools, research has shown that the Prolific panel is superior in terms of the comprehension, attention, and honesty of responses compared to other panels (Douglas, Ewell, and Brauer 2023; Eyal et al. 2021).\n$^{3}$ The research design was approved by the Research Ethics (IRB) Committee of the authors' institution (approval # 120/21).\n#\nR. SHANDLER\nTable 1. Description of treatment conditions.\n|  Treatment condition | N | Presidential threat / declaration | Implemented action  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  Stay out | 190 | The president declared that the U.S. would stay out of the conflict. | The U.S. refrained from engaging in the conflict.  |\n|  Back down | 210 | The president threatened that the U.S. military would engage and push out the attacking country | The U.S. backed down and did not engage the attacking country in any way.  |\n|  Engage militarily (Follow Through) | 175 | The president threatened that the U.S. military would engage and push out the attacking country | Deployed grounds troops against the attacking country  |\n|  Major (degradative) cyberattack | 181 | The president threatened that the U.S. military would engage and push out the attacking country | Major degradative cyberattack that crippled the attacking force's communication networks and rendered its radar system inoperable  |\n|  Minor (disruptive) cyberattack | 204 | The president threatened that the U.S. military would engage and push out the attacking country | Minor disruptive cyberattack that slowed the attacker's digital systems and publicized sensitive personnel files.  |\nattacking country.\" In each of these four conditions, the scenario continues with the president either backing down from the threat and abstaining from any military action (back down condition), deploying ground troops against the attacking country (engage militarily condition), employing major degradative cyberattacks that operationally cripple the attacking country's military forces (major cyberattack condition), or employing minor disruptive cyberattacks that cause temporary disruptions to the attacking country's digital systems (minor cyberattack condition). The full survey instruments appear in Online Appendix A, along with balance tables and treatment randomization checks.\nConsistent with other iterations of this experimental structure, I control for outcomes by ensuring that all treatment conditions lead to the same endpoint, with the hostile state gaining  $20\\%$  of the contested territory regardless of whether the President engages or stays out (Kertzer and Brutger 2016; Lin-Greenberg 2019). Likewise, seeing as domestic casualties are a central guiding factor in military approval, I control for this by ensuring that the United States experiences zero casualties in any scenario.4\nFollowing exposure to one of the conflict conditions, which was reinforced through a series of attention checks, I measured the dependent variable of interest by asking participants whether they approved or disapproved of the way the President handled the situation on a seven-point scale. Additionally, I collected data on respondents' dispositional\nINTERNATIONAL INTERACTIONS\n#\ncharacteristics such as militant assertiveness using a scale developed by Herrmann, Tetlock, and Visser (1999), international trust via a measured produced by Brewer (2004), and political ideology using the standard measure from the American National Election Studies. I further collected a comprehensive battery of demographic characteristics, including gender, employment, age, level of education, and technological literacy. Information on the scales and sources of all collected measures appears in the Online Appendix.\n# Results\nTo assess how use of force decisions give rise to audience costs, Figure 2 reveals the average treatment effect of each experimental condition on presidential approval. The average treatment effect consists of a regression coefficient estimate for each proxy treatment group when compared to the baseline \"Stay Out\" condition. $^{6}$  For this first analysis, I combine the two cyberattacks treatments into one overarching cyber group to construct a general cyber effect.\nA number of results immediately leap out. First, similarly to all audience cost experiments, we can see that the typical audience cost effect (conceptualized as the effect of backing down from a commitment compared to staying out of the conflict) is negative, large, and statistically significant  $(\\beta = -1.622, p &lt; .000)$ . This finding rehashes the central tenet of domestic audience costs, showing that voters will punish a leader for issuing a threat to use force and then backing down. Likewise, we can be encouraged by the fact that the level of support for engaging militarily (and not acting inconsistently) also acts as expected, with no statistically significant difference between military engagement and staying out of the conflict  $(\\beta = .151, p = \\mathrm{n.s.})$ . Essentially, voters are looking for consistency; they will not punish the president for evincing a desire to stay out of the conflict and doing so, nor will they punish the president for making a threat and following through. Only backing down from an explicit threat leads to domestic censure.\nWhen turning to our primary variable of interest, the effect of conducting cyberattacks, we can observe a slight but statistically significant increase in presidential approval following a cyberattack, compared to the\n6The full regression output appears in Online Appendix E.\n7The belligerence cost effect is necessarily smaller than the audience cost effect, since inconsistent behavior makes up the majority of an audience cost (Kertzer and Brutger 2016). The public applies a belligerence cost due to disapproval of aggressive behavior, even if it is consistent with past promises. In the presented results, engaging militarily did not lead to any statistically significant decrease in public approval. This is consistent with past findings by Lin-Greenberg (2019) and Croco, Hanmer, and McDonald (2021), and contrasts with Kertzer and Brutger (2016) who identified a slight but statistically significant belligerence cost.\n#\nR. SHANDLER\nFigure 2. Situational approval by experimental condition.\nNote: This plot depicts estimates of the treatment effect of each experimental condition on presidential approval relative to the stay out condition.

Bars represent  $95\\%$  confidence intervals and dots depict estimate means.\nbaseline stay out condition ( $\\beta = .360$ ,  $p &lt; .019$ ). According to our conceptualization of this treatment, cyberattacks constitute a repudiation of the initial promise, almost akin to backing down. The president had declared that the U.S. military would actively engage and push out the attacking country's forces. Yet far from actualizing this commitment, the president contented with a single barrage of cyberattacks against the attacking country's forces that merely publicized sensitive information or targeted its radar systems. Neither action represents a level of military engagement sufficient to \"push back the attacking forces,\" and the rival country would certainly view such an attack as a token and de-escalatory signal. Yet even though this path of action represents the kind of inconsistency that should evoke domestic disapproval — as with the back down condition — the public actually reports a slight increase in approval. As theorized, it appears that that a leader can back down from a threat without suffering domestic\ncensure simply by deploying militarily trivial cyber operations that appear forceful to domestic constituents.\nA fact that adds credibility to this reading of the results is the fact that the public keenly distinguishes between greater and lesser military action. Lin-Greenberg (2019) found that leaders who committed to full military action can partially mitigate audience costs by deploying lesser attack techniques such as air-strikes or sanctions. Lin-Greenberg's alternative attack options fell somewhere in between realizing the full-throated military threat and completely backing down — and the public was able to discern this important distinction leading to lowered but not entirely mitigated audience costs. Yet in the case of cyberattacks, we don't see merely reduced audience costs, we see an actual increase in approval ratings. The study respondents viewed the cyberattack as a kept promise, even though its effectiveness is objectively limited. This accords with research by Shandler, Gross, and Canetti (2021) who revealed a strong public enthusiasm for cyber warfare on the basis of its being perceived as an operationally effective military option that minimizes friendly and collateral deaths.\n### Breaking Down Cyberattacks—Degradative Versus Disruptive Strikes\nTo add additional nuance to the analyses, and to avoid the critique of earlier audience cost experiments that oversimplified the choices available to leaders, I break down cyberattacks into degradative (major) cyberattacks and disruptive (minor) cyberattacks. Disruptive cyber techniques differ from degradative attacks in the permanence, the destructiveness, and the operational effectiveness of the attack. We could expect that the rarer, and more degradative cyberattacks are far likelier to be construed by the public as meeting the leader's initial promise of “military engagement that pushes back the attackers' forces.” Disruptive cyberattacks, by contrast, should not even come close to meeting this promise and should be viewed as wholly equivalent to backing down.\nIn Figure 3, I again illustrate the average treatment effect for each experimental condition, though this time dividing the previously uniform cyberattacks into degradative and disruptive cyberattacks. Furthermore, I add an interaction effect to account for the respondents' level of technological literacy. This heterogeneous factor is crucial for the subsequent analysis since research has consistently shown that people's level of digital sophistication guides their perceptions of the efficacy of cyber threats and operations (Kostyuk & Wayne 2021; Gomez and Villar 2018).\n#\nR. SHANDLER\nFigure 3. Situational approval by experimental condition—conditional on technological literacy.\nNote: This plot depicts estimates of the treatment effect of each experimental condition on presidential approval relative to the stay out condition. Estimates are based on an OLS model with interaction effects between tech literacy and each proxy experimental condition. Bars represent  $95\\%$  confidence intervals and dots depict estimate means.\nFigure 3 reveals that no audience costs are levied for either degradative or disruptive attacks. In essence, the public perceives even minor cyberattacks that have no lasting operational benefits as meeting the commitment of leaders to \"push back an attacker.\" Critically, we can see that the wide-ranging approval of cyberattacks is not contingent on technological literacy. One would think that high-tech literacy respondents would be more aware of the limited effects produced by cyber operations and that this group would recognize that minor, disruptive cyber operations do not meet the promise of a strong military response — but even high-tech literacy respondents refrained from imposing audience costs on leaders who deployed cyberattacks in lieu of conventional force. Both technologically literate and illiterate respondents refrain from punishing a leader for employing cyber operations, granting presidential flexibility across the board.\nHeterogeneous Effects: Hawks and Doves\nAs a third analysis, I examine whether the cyber pathway of avoiding audience costs holds when viewed through the lens of political orientation. I take this step since studies have identified that the strength of audience costs is highly conditional upon political orientation (Kertzer and Brutger 2016). Kertzer and Brutger (2016) even found that hawks and doves apply audience costs for different reasons — with hawks primarily punishing inconsistency and doves punishing belligerence along with inconsistency.\nIn Figure 4, I once again illustrate the average treatment effect for each experimental condition, including an interaction effect to account for political orientation. Since we are dealing with foreign policy views, I use militant assertiveness to distinguish between hawkishness and dovishness, a measure that tests beliefs about the desirability and effectiveness of the use of force in foreign policy. This three-item scale, developed by Herrmann, Tetlock, and Visser (1999), is commonly used in experimental studies that focus on foreign policy attitudes rather than purely domestic political attitudes.\nThe results reveal that when it comes to backing down and engaging militarily, the participants act as expected. Doves apply a substantial audience cost that is made up of an inconsistency cost (49%) that censures the perceived inconsistency of the president's actions, and a belligerence cost (51%) that punishes the threats of force. Hawks, by contrast, apply a larger audience cost than doves, and this cost is made up entirely by the overwhelming aversion to the perceived inconsistency of the president's behavior (> 100%). Both hawks and doves impose audience costs, just for different reasons.\nBut how do these groups look upon the exercise of cyberattacks? Looking at Figure 4, we can see that both groups refrain from imposing any audience costs when leaders execute disruptive or degradative cyberattacks that depart from their initial promises. It appears that the use of cyberattacks moderates the extremities of the partisan divide over conducting military action. Looking at the “engage militarily” column, we can see that hawks reward leaders who engage in military action in accordance with their commitments, while doves punish leaders for their belligerence. Yet these extremes are visibly softened for both types of cyberattacks. Doves view the use of cyberattacks as less severe than conventional military engagements, and so the belligerence cost and the inconsistency cost disappear. Meanwhile, hawks are slightly less enamored of cyberattacks compared to conventional military attacks, but still find them to be sufficiently forceful to meet the initial promise and so avoid any semblance of inconsistency. Though there remain differences between these groups, cyberattacks demonstrate enormous promise in striking a middle ground that can assuage even the highly partisan perceptions of hawks and doves towards the use of force in conflict settings.\n#\nR. SHANDLER\nFigure 4. Situational approval by experimental condition—conditional on militant assertiveness (Hawks vs. Doves).\nNote: This plot depicts estimates of the treatment effect of each experimental condition on presidential approval relative to the stay out condition. Estimates are based on an OLS model with interaction effects between tech literacy and each proxy experimental condition. Bars represent  $95\\%$  confidence intervals and dots depict estimate means.\n# Robustness Tests\nResearchers have critiqued the use of hypothetical presidential figures in international relations experiments on the basis that presidential evaluations are largely driven by partisan cues that are absent in fictitious vignettes (Croco et al. 2021). To test the robustness of the current results in face of this critique, the survey participants were asked, as the experiment continued, to view updated conflict scenarios that depicted President Biden and Iran as the relevant actors. The alternate dependent variables in this case asked about the level of approval of President Biden's handling of the situation and measured the named President's job approval. I analyze this alternative experimental structure in Online Appendix C, finding that the same results recur under both hypothetical and realistic character representations. The study findings are also robust when excluding participants who failed any of the attention checks that were administered following the experimental treatments.\nDiscussion\nThis article proposes that the emergence of cyber capabilities has altered the nature of domestic audience costs. By taking advantage of voters' captivation with cyber power, and their understandable if erroneous belief in the operational effectiveness of cyber capabilities, leaders can back down from international threats while still appearing strong in the eyes of domestic constituents. I verify this theory through a novel experimental design, which confirms that the public views even minor cyberattacks — an objective signal of restraint — as sufficiently forceful to meet a leader's threat of force and avoid any semblance of inconsistency.\nEven with a well-founded theory backed up by robust experimental evidence, we must be careful when generalizing controlled experimental results to real-world events. Voters don't evaluate presidential performance in the artificial environment of survey experiments, and military conflict rarely abides by such clearly delineated phases of threats and responses as laid out in simplified experimental scenarios (Gartzke and Lupu 2012). Therefore, it behooves us to look for real-world examples of cyber audience costs that can corroborate the theory. Even if we cannot isolate specific causal mechanisms when examining historical events, it would be highly suggestive were we to find corroborating examples where minor cyberattacks were advertised as demonstrations of strength to domestic audiences, even while they were objectively used to walk back threats of escalation. I offer two cases where this behavior can be partly observed.\nA first real-world example occurred on June 20, 2019, when Iran shot down a U.S. R1-4 Global Hawk UAV (Newman 2019). President Trump immediately and publicly threatened massive retaliatory military strikes against targets inside Iran, claiming that Iran faced “obliteration” for their acts. The threat was ignored by Iranian authorities who insisted that they would continue to shoot down any U.S. assets that entered Iranian airspace (Pickrell 2019). Yet even after publicly issuing a threat, President Trump backed down from the initial threat, sufficing with a series of cyberattacks that disabled Iran's ability to track ships in the region and compromised Iran's missile defense systems (Valeriano and Jensen 2022).\nFrom every possible angle, it is indisputable that President Trump walked back his initial threat, setting in place the precise conditions that should give rise to critical domestic censure and generate inconsistency costs. In lieu of the promised “obliteration,” the American response de-escalated the situation by conducting a relatively minor cyberattack that signaled restraint. The cyberattack was effectively used as an off-ramp to avoid a dangerous escalation of hostilities (Valeriano and Jensen 2022), and indeed this cycle of hostilities came to an end.\nYet to the domestic public, the restrained cyberattack was not viewed as a capitulation. Even though the attack objectively failed to meet the severity of the initial promise to “obliterate” Iran, the cyberattack was still viewed as a signal of strength and resolve. Comparing polls taken immediately prior and following the incident, President Trump suffered no situational disapproval or lowered confidence in voters' perceptions of his ability to handle the situation in Iran (Pew Research Center 2019). In fact, the Trump administration may have exploited the secrecy that is inherently connected with cyber operations to inflate voters' beliefs about the attack's impact (Baram 2023, 2022). By emphasizing the covertness of the attack and the ambiguity associated with the effects, media coverage of the incident likely inflated public perceptions about the severity of the muted cyberattack.\nA similar scenario played out in Israel one year later. During April 2020, Iranian hackers infiltrated the systems of an Israeli water plant (Times of Israel 2020). The hackers sought to cripple computer systems that controlled water flow and raise the level of chlorine within the water mix that was distributed to Israeli homes. The incident was thwarted before it could cause major damage, though it sent shivers down the country's spine. Israeli citizens were baying for blood, and Israeli leadership declared that the targeting of civilian infrastructure was a “red line” that warranted swift, decisive, and massive retaliation.\nYet massive retaliation did not arrive. Instead, Israel conducted a rather innocuous cyber operation targeting Iran's Shahid Rajaee port, causing a temporary traffic jam among commercial shipping vehicles (Warrick and Nakashima 2020). To the Iranians and to the international community who were working to avoid any military escalation, the limited Israeli cyberattack marked an end to fears of impending war. Yet to Israeli civilians, the cyberattack was trumpeted as a remarkable sign of Israeli cyber prowess and a blow to the Iranian regime (Baram 2023). Once again, a country's leadership could have their cake and eat it too, appearing strong to domestic audiences while backing down from military escalation.\nZooming out, this study bears implications on three different aspects of conflict — the escalatory properties of cyber power, the efficacy of conflict signaling in the cyber age, and the role of public opinion in foreign affairs. First, regarding the debate over the escalatory dynamics of cyber operations, we can now add a small weight on the de-escalatory side of the scale. It was once thought that public exposure to frightening cyberattacks would cause mass demands for retaliation, generating\nescalatory pressure on leaders who must be responsive to public sentiment (Shandler, Gross, and Canetti 2022). Yet this idea has been refuted (Kreps and Schneider 2019), and the evidence now suggests that public opinion adds de-escalatory pressures to cyber operations, granting leaders the ability to act with restraint without worrying about militant domestic blowback.\nSecond, what does this finding mean for the future of conflict signaling? Credibility lies at the core of international relations, and leaders have developed sophisticated methods to send signals that overcome a built-in credibility deficit — the most famous of which are costly signaling. Yet according to this paper, rivals can no longer trust purportedly costly tied-hands signals if they know that the signaling leaders possess a path of action that allows them to avoid the imposition of audience costs - even if they back down from their threat. Absent any compensatory mechanisms, the reduced effectiveness of costly signaling will insert significant uncertainty into crisis bargaining and increase skepticism about the authenticity of military threats.\nOne option to salvage this popular form of signaling may be to issue more specific and severe threats. As a rule, leaders prefer to keep their options open by issuing general threats (Quek and Johnston 2018; Snyder and Borghard 2011). Yet the advent of cyber circumvention strategies may require that future threats become more specific in order to maintain their previous levels of credibility. For officials seeking to impose audience costs, they may now be required to declare that the United States Army will send ground forces from a particular unit to secure a site, or that the U.S. Air Force will launch specific missiles if a rival doesn't back down, since only highly specific guarantees can ensure that a cyber-attack will be perceived as inconsistent with the threats. Alternatively, leaders may be forced to rely on alternative signaling techniques, reweighing the form and balance of their signaling communications. While tied-hands signals are commonly conceived as being the most effective method of conveying intentions (Fearon 1997), leaders possess an arsenal of other techniques at their disposal that may now become more popular (Quek 2021).\nLast, regarding public opinion, we gain yet another piece of evidence attesting to the consequentiality of public opinion toward cyber operations. It is easy to dismiss the relevance of public opinion when it comes to international relations. Intricate dynamics of international conflict tend to take place above the heads of regular voters, who have historically deferred to elites in such matters (Berinsky 2009). Yet research consistently shows that public opinion can have a small yet meaningful effect on conflict decision-making (Sevenans 2021; Lin-Greenberg 2021; Tomz and Weeks 2020). This is especially the case when it comes to cyber power, and leaders must be attuned to public attitudes. We already know that public\nexposure to incoming cyberattacks can manifest major political consequences (Shandler, Gross, and Canetti 2023), and now we see that the reverse is true as well — that public enthusiasm for outgoing cyber operations can generate new conflict dynamics. It is a lessen well worth learning that public opinion matters in cyber conflict.\nI end by noting several research limitations that deserve attention. Most conspicuously, the phases of the experimental game — wherein a leader issues a threat, awaits a response, and then decides how to react — is but one of many possible scenarios in which cyber operations might be deployed. This echoes a frequent critique that audience cost experiments lack ecological validity (Snyder and Borghard 2011). While conceding that future research should examine the veracity of the findings under different scenarios, the core finding — that domestic audiences view cyberattacks as a demonstration of forceful leadership — is not reliant on the particular circumstances of this or any other study's experimental setup. The present study would also benefit from complementary research into how elites and foreign states view cyber operations. The ability of leaders to de-escalate conflict while still appearing strong in the eyes of domestic constituents is reliant on the fact that foreign actors will indeed view cyber operations as an act of restraint. To date, this second half of the equation is surmised on the basis of extensive observational and experimental studies that have accumulated in the literature (Jensen, Valeriano, and Whitt 2024; Lin-Greenberg 2023; Kostyuk and Gartzke 2022; Maschmeyer and Dunn Cavelty 2022; Gomez and Whyte 2020). Corroborating this component with robust experimental data would provide a fuller picture showing how different stakeholders perceived cyber capabilities, and how these perceptions are strategically consequential.\nI gratefully acknowledge the valuable feedback offered by colleagues and friends, among them: Daphna Canetti, Andres Gannon, Miguel Gomez, Erik Lin-Greenberg, Michael Gross, Nadiya Kostyuk, Harry Oppenheimer, Jordan Tama, Brandon Valeriano, and Christopher Whyte.

En exploitant la fascination des électeurs pour le cyberconflit, les dirigeants peuvent désormais désamorcer les crises en toute sécurité, sans avoir à craindre une censure nationale. Tel est l'attrait du cyberpouvoir chez le grand public que même des cyberattaques mineures, aux conséquences opérationnelles faibles, peuvent apaiser l'attente d'une puissante force militaire chez les électeurs. En pratique, cela signifie que les dirigeants qui seraient sinon tenus par des coûts d'audience nationaux peuvent y « échapper » en menant des cyberattaques à l'efficacité superficielle, mais suffisante pour les électeurs nationaux. Pour explorer la modération des pressions d'escalade nationales grâce aux cyberopérations, je mène une expérience de sondage qui demande aux participants d'évaluer les qualités de dirigeant de leur président après le déploiement d'une cyberforce ou d'une force conventionnelle. Les résultats confirment que le public considère les cyberattaques, même si elles sont éphémères et exemptes de conséquences, comme étant suffisamment vigoureuses pour répondre aux menaces de recours à la force d'un dirigeant et apaiser ses envies d'actions militaires. En proposant des exemples concrets de cette théorie dans de nombreux incidents du monde réels, je démontre que l'enthousiasme du public pour le cyberpouvoir ajoute une toute nouvelle flexibilité à la prise de décisions par temps de crise.\n## Introduction\nVoters are enthralled by cyber power. In the eyes of the public, cyber power is an almighty technological weapon that can pierce through enemy defenses — leaving a trail of destruction in its inscrutable wake (Shandler, Gross, and Canetti 2021). Cyberattacks arouse severe anxiety when turned against us (Backhaus et al. 2020), and they foster keen enthusiasm when used against our adversaries (Leal and Musgrave 2023). These beliefs about cyber power are, of course, steeped in hyperbole — yet they are earnestly held by a credulous public who are buffeted by a constant din of sensationalist media reporting of cyber doom narratives (Makridis, Maschmeyer, and Smeets 2024; Lawson 2019). The disjoint between perception and reality presents political leaders with an opportunity to appear strong without taking strong action. Applying a framework of domestic audience\ncosts (Fearon 1994), I demonstrate how the allure of cyber power allows leaders to back down from explicit threats without suffering domestic censure. This finding reimagines the logic of audience costs for a digital age.\nDomestic politics and public opinion are integral features of many modern theories of international conflict (Kertzer 2023, 2018). Democratic leaders pay keen attention to voters' attitudes toward war, with public opinion capable of acting as a constraint on escalation (Baum and Potter 2015; Gelpi 2017), or a spur that pushes leaders to retaliate (Ribar 2021; Dafoe et al. 2022). When it comes to cyber power, it was once thought that public engagement with cyberattacks would manifest in the latter category — adding escalatory momentum to conflict situations. So the thinking went, widespread exposure to frightening cyberattacks would lead to mass demands for retaliation, generating escalatory tailwinds and encouraging leaders to respond with any means necessary (Leal and Musgrave 2023; Shandler, Gross, and Canetti 2022). Yet the reality turned out to be far more muted. The ambiguity and uncertainty associated with cyber threats undercut public support for retaliation (Jardine, Porter, and Shandler 2024), and predominantly subversive cyber operations failed to evoke the level of destructiveness that would generate domestic political pressure to engage in military action (Maschmeyer 2021, 2023).\nThis article reimagines the effect of voters' captivation with cyber power, arguing that it acts as a check on conflict escalation by adding flexibility to crisis decision making. By exploiting the public enthusiasm for cyber force, leaders can safely de-escalate crisis situations without worrying about suffering domestic censure (Lonergan and Lonergan 2022). I argue that when states conduct cyber operations, the domestic public are likely to view the use of cyberattacks as a strong sign of resolve — even if the effectiveness of the cyberattack is objectively limited. Essentially, cyber power enables leaders to de-escalate conflict without having to worry about suffering domestic censure for acting weakly or inconsistently on the international stage.\nUnderstanding the interplay between public opinion and cyber conflict requires that we descend from an international level of analysis, where most escalation debates play out, to an individual level of analysis grounded in political psychology and lay perceptions. In answering why low-cost, non-destructive cyber operations would ever be sufficient to placate hawkish domestic audiences (Yoder 2022) — the answer lies not in theories of signaling or compellence, but in theories of public opinion. Interpreting the impact of public opinion on foreign affairs requires that we interrogate the psychological and cognitive dimensions of cyber conflict, not its strategic impact.\nTo test whether cyber operations can truly temper domestic escalatory pressures, I conduct a survey experiment with a sample of American voters that asks participants to evaluate presidential leadership following the\ndeployment of cyber or conventional force. The experimental findings confirm that the public view cyberattacks — even ephemeral, inconsequential cyberattacks — as sufficiently forceful to meet a leader's threat of force and placate any public zeal for vengeance. I further verify that the results transcend partisan affiliation and recur at all levels of technological literacy.\nThese findings demonstrate how public perceptions of cyber power adds newfound flexibility to crisis decision making. By exploiting the public enthusiasm for cyber force, leaders can safely de-escalate crisis situations while maintaining a seemingly muscular foreign policy posture in the eyes of their domestic constituents. In the subsequent sections, I begin by laying out the foundations of public attitudes toward cyber conflict. After introducing the conceptual foundation, I present a novel experimental design and a set of results that verify the theory using the well-worn technique of audience-cost experiments. Last, I discuss the implications of the findings, and offer examples of how this theory has played out in real world incidents.\n## Voters' Perceptions of Cyber Power—A Terrifyingly Effective Domain\nPerceptions of cyber power are rooted in fear and emotions (Shandler, Snider, et al. 2022). A growing set of experimental works has demonstrated that voters experience mental anguish in the aftermath of cyberattacks. Exposure to even benign cyberattacks triggers spikes in stress and anxiety (Backhaus et al. 2020), threat perception (Snider et al. 2021; Gross et al. 2017), anger (Shandler, Gross, and Canetti 2022), dread (Gomez and Villar 2018; Shandler and Gomez 2023), and a willingness to sacrifice civil liberties to protect against future attacks (Snider et al. 2025; Snider et al. 2021).\nThis inflated sense of threat among the public is driven by several features that are specific to cyberspace. The anonymity and mystique that are commonly associated with cyberspace exacerbate negative psychological responses, with unknown and seemingly omniscient perpetrators creating an environment of panic and helplessness (Dunn Cavelty 2012; Hansen and Nissenbaum 2009; Gomez and Whyte 2021). Moreover, the public's lack of technical sophistication when it comes to cyber threats ferments feelings of dread, a trend that is magnified by the constant exposure to seemingly irrepressible cyberattacks on a growing array of devices (Gomez and Villar 2018; Bada and Nurse 2020; McDermott 2019).\nMuch of the hyperbolic views of omnipotent and destructive cyber actors can be traced to sensationalized media coverage and popular culture depictions of cyber power (Lawson 2019; Dunn Cavelty 2019). This dramatized coverage has come to be known as the “cyber doom narrative,” a teleological expectation that digital insecurity will inevitably result in mass societal collapse as our growing dependence on digital systems renders us vulnerable\nto attacks (Gomez and Whyte 2021; Hansen and Nissenbaum 2009). Having been emotionally primed to experience dread, anxiety, and helplessness in the face of cyberattacks, it is no wonder that the public is liable to buy into the pervasive cultural narrative surrounding cyber threats. As a case in point, a field study of a mundane ransomware attack against a hospital in Germany revealed intense public anxiety, and a steep fall in voters' trust in their government, despite authorities' attempts to calm the jittery residents (Shandler and Gomez 2023; Gomez and Shandler 2024).\nWhile the public has developed a deep trepidation towards the destructive potential of cyber threats, it has, by the same logic, warmly embraced cyberattacks as an effective military offensive option. A series of experiments across multiple countries has observed a consistently high level of public enthusiasm for employing cyberattacks to respond to national security threats (Leal and Musgrave 2023). Voters are enthused by the perceived capacity of cyberattacks as an operationally effective attack option that avoids placing troops in harm's way and which minimizes civilian casualties (Demarest, Jost, and Schub 2024). Even in response to the most egregious and deadly attacks, the public views cyberattacks as being a highly effective and appropriate retaliatory option (Gross, Canetti, and Vashdi 2017; Jardine et al. 2024).\nPublic beliefs about cyber power are made salient by the fact that cyber operations are now widely publicized. In the past, cyber operations were famous for taking place under a cloak of anonymity. Yet in recent years, there has been a distinct trend towards public disclosure of cyberattacks wherein authorities willingly publicize what were once secretive cyber operations (Baram 2023; Baram 2022; Poznansky and Perkoski 2018; Egloff and Smeets 2023). Leaders opt to openly divulge cyber operations to signal strength and prestige to external audiences (Egloff and Smeets 2023; Smeets and Lin 2018), to legitimize investments in the cyber domain (Jacobsen and Ringsmose 2017), and to undermine rivals' trust in technology infrastructure (Jacobsen and Ringsmose 2017). This article reinforces an additional rationale for self-attribution, which is signaling strength and resolve to domestic audiences who are galvanized by displays of military force in general, and cyber-force in particular (Shandler et al. 2021).\nIt would be understandable at this point for readers to protest that: public perceptions about cyber power are simply incorrect. I agree - public beliefs about cyber power do not necessarily match its constrained reality. Among military officials and cyber experts, the prevailing view holds that cyber power is incapable of independently effecting strategic outcomes, and that it is primarily effective as a force amplifier in coordination with conventional military forces (Valeriano, Jensen, and Maness 2018), or as an act of sub-crisis maneuvering that operates below the threshold of conflict (Maschmeyer 2021; Maschmeyer 2023; Valeriano and Maness 2014;\ncf. Demarest, Jost, and Schub 2024). Nevertheless, the disjoint between public perceptions of cyber strength and the reality of its constrained effectiveness is precisely the phenomenon that creates a strategic opportunity for leaders to overcome domestic escalatory pressure.\nSpecifically, this paper targets two gaps in the cyber conflict literature that remain understudied. Much of the existing research on cyber power is dedicated to scrutinizing the objective effects and effectiveness of cyber operations. However, it is imperative that we also recognize the impact of (oftentimes distorted) perceptions about cyber power. Beliefs about cyber capabilities, even if untethered from reality, shape behavior and decision-making in real ways. Additionally, the accumulating research on public opinion and cyber power must take a final step to interrogate the strategic impact of public attitudes and beliefs. To date, mounting empirical research has demonstrated that cyberattacks roil public beliefs about international affairs and arouse strong emotional reactions (Shandler and Canetti 2024). The missing step is to connect these public responses to concrete political outcomes to make the case of why public opinion matters. In the next section, we take this leap by interpreting public opinion through the prism of domestic audience costs.\n## Interpreting Cyber Operations Through the Lens of Audience Costs\nTo briefly revisit the main tenets of audience cost theory, governments manufacture domestic audience costs to credibly communicate resolve to actors in the international arena. By publicly threatening to employ military force, leaders add credibility to their signals, since both parties to the conflict are aware that domestic constituencies punish governments that say one thing and do another (Fearon 1994; Smith 1998; Baum 2004; Slantchev 2006; Weeks 2008). The presence of audience costs transforms public threats from cheap talk into informative signals. According to the basic precepts of this theory, when a rival refuses to accede to a threat underpinned by audience costs, a leader has two principal options: to follow through on the threat and so escalate the conflict, or to back down from the threat and suffer domestic censure.\nCyber operations challenge this basic theory. What if there was an option for leaders to publicly issue a threat (an ostensibly costly signal), and yet avoid the imposition of audience costs were they to back down? I argue that cyberattacks can strike this delicate balance. To the domestic audience, wielding cyber power sends a message of strength since the public holds clear (if exaggerated) beliefs about the value and effectiveness of cyber power. Importantly, this domestically targeted message of strength is untethered to the operational effects produced by cyberattacks. As such, even minor cyberattacks with little operational or escalatory impact can placate voters' expectation of “strong” military resolve.\nINTERNATIONAL INTERACTIONS\n#\nIn Figure 1, I visualize an updated crisis bargaining model that newly incorporates cyberattacks as a distinct military option. The figure reimagines the traditional decision tree associated with audience cost theories, with the addition of a new option (D) depicted in blue. The scenario depicts a crisis between two players — who we can think of as a country (1) and a foreign rival (2). The game progresses with the country deciding at the first phase whether to publicly threaten the use of force against the foreign rival in attempt to achieve a strategic objective. If the country refrains from making any threat — then the scenario ends with them having decided to (A) stay out of the crisis. If the country issues a threat, and the foreign rival does not concede, then the onus moves back to the country to decide whether to (B) back down from their threat, or (C) follow through on their threat. Audience cost models are principally\nFigure 1. Updated crisis bargaining model with new cyberattack option.\nNote: The figure reflects the crisis scenario with expected domestic and strategic payoffs for player 1 presented under each terminal node. Ticks reflect the optimal outcomes, with no audience costs being preferred to the sufferance of audience costs, and de-escalation being preferred to military escalation. Only decision (D) leads to a situation where no audience costs are suffered and the crisis is de-escalated.\n|   | (B) Backs Down | (C) Follows Through | (D) Cyber Attack  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  Domestic Audience Cost: | Suffers Audience Cost | No Audience Cost | No Audience Cost  |\n|  Crisis Outcome: | De-Escalation | Military Escalation | De-Escalation  |\nconcerned with the difference between staying out and backing down, since publics demonstrably punish leaders who renege on their commitments.\nUntil now, these first options reflect the typical crisis bargaining model. Each of options (B) and (C) yields a negative consequence. By backing down from a threat, a government can refrain from unwanted military escalation, but will suffer a drop in public approval as their domestic constituents punish them for acting inconsistently and weakly (Kertzer and Brutger 2016). Alternatively, by following through and engaging in military action, a government can avoid domestic denunciation, but must prepare for a military conflagration whose consequences are unknown. We now add an additional avenue of action (D) — which depicts a government decision to conduct a cyberattack.\nBased on the above analysis describing how voters perceive cyber power, we can expect that employing a cyberattack allows the government player to mitigate any negative consequences — epitomizing a digital get out jail free card. The evidence suggests that cyber operations conducted in isolation are not a replacement for conventional warfare (Kostyuk and Gartzke 2022), and they are unlikely to engender escalatory consequences (Jensen, Valeriano, and Whitt 2024; Lin-Greenberg 2023; Libicki 2020; Fischerkeller and Harknett 2017). Yet from the perspective of the public, the cyberattack would be viewed as an act of force and a clear expression of intent. Seeing as the public view cyberspace as an effective operational domain, comparable to air and land power, launching a cyberattack meets the initial promise of force and allays any modicum of inconsistency that would give rise to audience costs. The country's leader, in this scenario, has the best of both worlds — they have backed down from a potentially escalatory conflict situation while avoiding domestic political consequences.\nAdmittedly, this logical chain of events represents just one scenario in which offensive cyber operations might be used in conflict settings. Nevertheless, this model of crisis bargaining has served to theorize about leader's decision making for decades, and there is value in overlaying cyber operations on a well-formed model of international relations. Our central focus of interest is whether benign cyber operations can effectively send signals of strength to domestic audiences. On this basis, I put forward the following testable hypothesis: cyberattacks, even those with limited operational effects, will be interpreted as a signal of strength and an effective projection of force by domestic audiences.\n## Experimental Methodology\nTo test the above theoretical framework, I employ a well-trodden pathway for experimentally examining audience costs that relies on original survey\nINTERNATIONAL INTERACTIONS\n#\nexperiments. Since Tomz (2007) first introduced a technique to empirically scrutinize the phenomenon, a series of subsequent experiments have corroborated its veracity and successfully replicated and extended the inherent logic of audience costs (Hoffman et al. 2009; Trager and Vavreck 2011; Levendusky and Horowitz 2012; Davies and Johns 2013; Chaudoin 2014; Kertzer and Brutger 2016; Lin-Greenberg 2019). This experimental approach has proven popular because selection biases mean that audience costs are difficulty to study through observational data. $^{1}$\nThe experimental design involved fielding an online survey experiment in March 2021 on a national sample of 960 Americans recruited using the Prolific Survey Panel. The study respondents represented a cross-section of the general population (mean age = 35 years, SD = 12.9). The sample's political orientation leans slightly to the left, with 56% of respondents self-identifying as progressive, while the gender distribution is exactly 50% male and female. Since the purpose of the study is to challenge the conventional logic of audience costs, the structure of the experiment draws heavily from the setup introduced in Tomz's (2007) audience cost study, which has been subject to extensive corroboration and replication. All research design and hypotheses were pre-registered prior to data collection.\nTo begin, all respondents were introduced to a scenario according to which \"a foreign country sent its military to take over a territorial region of its neighboring country.\" Respondents were then randomly assigned to one of five treatment conditions (see Table 1) that varied whether or not the U.S. president threatened to intervene and use force, and whether the president followed through on the threat in one way or another. In the stay out condition, which acts as a control group, the president pledges to stay out of the conflict, and indeed refrains from engaging in any conflict. In the other four treatment groups, respondents are told that \"the U.S. president declared that if the attacking country continues to invade, the U.S. military would immediately engage and attempt to push out the\n$^{1}$ I acknowledge a resilient school of thought that casts doubt on the empirical validity and theoretical persuasiveness of the phenomenon. One group of critics claim that artificially constructed experimental scenarios lack ecological and external validity since leaders allegedly fail to issue explicit threats, (Snyder and Borghard 2011) or because fictional experiments overstate the costs that respondents impose on real leaders (Croco et al. 2021; Kurizaki and Whang 2015). Another group of critics posit that the absence of real-world crises with corresponding audience cost outcomes calls into question the external validity of this theory (Trachtenberg 2012; Gartzke and Lupu 2012). While conceding the need to carefully construct experimental techniques that mimic real-world scenarios, I suggest that real-world events needn't accord precisely with the phased layout of the experimental structure for us to learn valuable lessons.\n$^{2}$ While all online survey panels have a mixed reputation regarding the representativeness of their participant pools, research has shown that the Prolific panel is superior in terms of the comprehension, attention, and honesty of responses compared to other panels (Douglas, Ewell, and Brauer 2023; Eyal et al. 2021).\n$^{3}$ The research design was approved by the Research Ethics (IRB) Committee of the authors' institution (approval # 120/21).\n#\nR. SHANDLER\nTable 1. Description of treatment conditions.\n|  Treatment condition | N | Presidential threat / declaration | Implemented action  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  Stay out | 190 | The president declared that the U.S. would stay out of the conflict. | The U.S. refrained from engaging in the conflict.  |\n|  Back down | 210 | The president threatened that the U.S. military would engage and push out the attacking country | The U.S. backed down and did not engage the attacking country in any way.  |\n|  Engage militarily (Follow Through) | 175 | The president threatened that the U.S. military would engage and push out the attacking country | Deployed grounds troops against the attacking country  |\n|  Major (degradative) cyberattack | 181 | The president threatened that the U.S. military would engage and push out the attacking country | Major degradative cyberattack that crippled the attacking force's communication networks and rendered its radar system inoperable  |\n|  Minor (disruptive) cyberattack | 204 | The president threatened that the U.S. military would engage and push out the attacking country | Minor disruptive cyberattack that slowed the attacker's digital systems and publicized sensitive personnel files.  |\nattacking country.\" In each of these four conditions, the scenario continues with the president either backing down from the threat and abstaining from any military action (back down condition), deploying ground troops against the attacking country (engage militarily condition), employing major degradative cyberattacks that operationally cripple the attacking country's military forces (major cyberattack condition), or employing minor disruptive cyberattacks that cause temporary disruptions to the attacking country's digital systems (minor cyberattack condition). The full survey instruments appear in Online Appendix A, along with balance tables and treatment randomization checks.\nConsistent with other iterations of this experimental structure, I control for outcomes by ensuring that all treatment conditions lead to the same endpoint, with the hostile state gaining  $20\\%$  of the contested territory regardless of whether the President engages or stays out (Kertzer and Brutger 2016; Lin-Greenberg 2019). Likewise, seeing as domestic casualties are a central guiding factor in military approval, I control for this by ensuring that the United States experiences zero casualties in any scenario.4\nFollowing exposure to one of the conflict conditions, which was reinforced through a series of attention checks, I measured the dependent variable of interest by asking participants whether they approved or disapproved of the way the President handled the situation on a seven-point scale. Additionally, I collected data on respondents' dispositional\nINTERNATIONAL INTERACTIONS\n#\ncharacteristics such as militant assertiveness using a scale developed by Herrmann, Tetlock, and Visser (1999), international trust via a measured produced by Brewer (2004), and political ideology using the standard measure from the American National Election Studies. I further collected a comprehensive battery of demographic characteristics, including gender, employment, age, level of education, and technological literacy. Information on the scales and sources of all collected measures appears in the Online Appendix.\n# Results\nTo assess how use of force decisions give rise to audience costs, Figure 2 reveals the average treatment effect of each experimental condition on presidential approval. The average treatment effect consists of a regression coefficient estimate for each proxy treatment group when compared to the baseline \"Stay Out\" condition. $^{6}$  For this first analysis, I combine the two cyberattacks treatments into one overarching cyber group to construct a general cyber effect.\nA number of results immediately leap out. First, similarly to all audience cost experiments, we can see that the typical audience cost effect (conceptualized as the effect of backing down from a commitment compared to staying out of the conflict) is negative, large, and statistically significant  $(\\beta = -1.622, p &lt; .000)$ . This finding rehashes the central tenet of domestic audience costs, showing that voters will punish a leader for issuing a threat to use force and then backing down. Likewise, we can be encouraged by the fact that the level of support for engaging militarily (and not acting inconsistently) also acts as expected, with no statistically significant difference between military engagement and staying out of the conflict  $(\\beta = .151, p = \\mathrm{n.s.})$ . Essentially, voters are looking for consistency; they will not punish the president for evincing a desire to stay out of the conflict and doing so, nor will they punish the president for making a threat and following through. Only backing down from an explicit threat leads to domestic censure.\nWhen turning to our primary variable of interest, the effect of conducting cyberattacks, we can observe a slight but statistically significant increase in presidential approval following a cyberattack, compared to the\n6The full regression output appears in Online Appendix E.\n7The belligerence cost effect is necessarily smaller than the audience cost effect, since inconsistent behavior makes up the majority of an audience cost (Kertzer and Brutger 2016). The public applies a belligerence cost due to disapproval of aggressive behavior, even if it is consistent with past promises. In the presented results, engaging militarily did not lead to any statistically significant decrease in public approval. This is consistent with past findings by Lin-Greenberg (2019) and Croco, Hanmer, and McDonald (2021), and contrasts with Kertzer and Brutger (2016) who identified a slight but statistically significant belligerence cost.\n#\nR. SHANDLER\nFigure 2. Situational approval by experimental condition.\nNote: This plot depicts estimates of the treatment effect of each experimental condition on presidential approval relative to the stay out condition. Estimates are based on an OLS model with each condition inserted as a proxy. Bars represent  $95\\%$  confidence intervals and dots depict estimate means.\nbaseline stay out condition ( $\\beta = .360$ ,  $p &lt; .019$ ). According to our conceptualization of this treatment, cyberattacks constitute a repudiation of the initial promise, almost akin to backing down. The president had declared that the U.S. military would actively engage and push out the attacking country's forces. Yet far from actualizing this commitment, the president contented with a single barrage of cyberattacks against the attacking country's forces that merely publicized sensitive information or targeted its radar systems. Neither action represents a level of military engagement sufficient to \"push back the attacking forces,\" and the rival country would certainly view such an attack as a token and de-escalatory signal. Yet even though this path of action represents the kind of inconsistency that should evoke domestic disapproval — as with the back down condition — the public actually reports a slight increase in approval. As theorized, it appears that that a leader can back down from a threat without suffering domestic\ncensure simply by deploying militarily trivial cyber operations that appear forceful to domestic constituents.\nA fact that adds credibility to this reading of the results is the fact that the public keenly distinguishes between greater and lesser military action. Lin-Greenberg (2019) found that leaders who committed to full military action can partially mitigate audience costs by deploying lesser attack techniques such as air-strikes or sanctions. Lin-Greenberg's alternative attack options fell somewhere in between realizing the full-throated military threat and completely backing down — and the public was able to discern this important distinction leading to lowered but not entirely mitigated audience costs. Yet in the case of cyberattacks, we don't see merely reduced audience costs, we see an actual increase in approval ratings. The study respondents viewed the cyberattack as a kept promise, even though its effectiveness is objectively limited. This accords with research by Shandler, Gross, and Canetti (2021) who revealed a strong public enthusiasm for cyber warfare on the basis of its being perceived as an operationally effective military option that minimizes friendly and collateral deaths.\n### Breaking Down Cyberattacks—Degradative Versus Disruptive Strikes\nTo add additional nuance to the analyses, and to avoid the critique of earlier audience cost experiments that oversimplified the choices available to leaders, I break down cyberattacks into degradative (major) cyberattacks and disruptive (minor) cyberattacks. Disruptive cyber techniques differ from degradative attacks in the permanence, the destructiveness, and the operational effectiveness of the attack. We could expect that the rarer, and more degradative cyberattacks are far likelier to be construed by the public as meeting the leader's initial promise of “military engagement that pushes back the attackers' forces.” Disruptive cyberattacks, by contrast, should not even come close to meeting this promise and should be viewed as wholly equivalent to backing down.\nIn Figure 3, I again illustrate the average treatment effect for each experimental condition, though this time dividing the previously uniform cyberattacks into degradative and disruptive cyberattacks. Furthermore, I add an interaction effect to account for the respondents' level of technological literacy. This heterogeneous factor is crucial for the subsequent analysis since research has consistently shown that people's level of digital sophistication guides their perceptions of the efficacy of cyber threats and operations (Kostyuk & Wayne 2021; Gomez and Villar 2018).\n#\nR. SHANDLER\nFigure 3. Situational approval by experimental condition—conditional on technological literacy.\nNote: This plot depicts estimates of the treatment effect of each experimental condition on presidential approval relative to the stay out condition. Estimates are based on an OLS model with interaction effects between tech literacy and each proxy experimental condition. Bars represent  $95\\%$  confidence intervals and dots depict estimate means.\nFigure 3 reveals that no audience costs are levied for either degradative or disruptive attacks. In essence, the public perceives even minor cyberattacks that have no lasting operational benefits as meeting the commitment of leaders to \"push back an attacker.\" Critically, we can see that the wide-ranging approval of cyberattacks is not contingent on technological literacy. One would think that high-tech literacy respondents would be more aware of the limited effects produced by cyber operations and that this group would recognize that minor, disruptive cyber operations do not meet the promise of a strong military response — but even high-tech literacy respondents refrained from imposing audience costs on leaders who deployed cyberattacks in lieu of conventional force. Both technologically literate and illiterate respondents refrain from punishing a leader for employing cyber operations, granting presidential flexibility across the board.\nHeterogeneous Effects: Hawks and Doves\nAs a third analysis, I examine whether the cyber pathway of avoiding audience costs holds when viewed through the lens of political orientation. I take this step since studies have identified that the strength of audience costs is highly conditional upon political orientation (Kertzer and Brutger 2016). Kertzer and Brutger (2016) even found that hawks and doves apply audience costs for different reasons — with hawks primarily punishing inconsistency and doves punishing belligerence along with inconsistency.\nIn Figure 4, I once again illustrate the average treatment effect for each experimental condition, including an interaction effect to account for political orientation. Since we are dealing with foreign policy views, I use militant assertiveness to distinguish between hawkishness and dovishness, a measure that tests beliefs about the desirability and effectiveness of the use of force in foreign policy. This three-item scale, developed by Herrmann, Tetlock, and Visser (1999), is commonly used in experimental studies that focus on foreign policy attitudes rather than purely domestic political attitudes.\nThe results reveal that when it comes to backing down and engaging militarily, the participants act as expected. Doves apply a substantial audience cost that is made up of an inconsistency cost (49%) that censures the perceived inconsistency of the president's actions, and a belligerence cost (51%) that punishes the threats of force. Hawks, by contrast, apply a larger audience cost than doves, and this cost is made up entirely by the overwhelming aversion to the perceived inconsistency of the president's behavior (> 100%). Both hawks and doves impose audience costs, just for different reasons.\nBut how do these groups look upon the exercise of cyberattacks? Looking at Figure 4, we can see that both groups refrain from imposing any audience costs when leaders execute disruptive or degradative cyberattacks that depart from their initial promises. It appears that the use of cyberattacks moderates the extremities of the partisan divide over conducting military action. Looking at the “engage militarily” column, we can see that hawks reward leaders who engage in military action in accordance with their commitments, while doves punish leaders for their belligerence. Yet these extremes are visibly softened for both types of cyberattacks. Doves view the use of cyberattacks as less severe than conventional military engagements, and so the belligerence cost and the inconsistency cost disappear. Meanwhile, hawks are slightly less enamored of cyberattacks compared to conventional military attacks, but still find them to be sufficiently forceful to meet the initial promise and so avoid any semblance of inconsistency. Though there remain differences between these groups, cyberattacks demonstrate enormous promise in striking a middle ground that can assuage even the highly partisan perceptions of hawks and doves towards the use of force in conflict settings.\n#\nR. SHANDLER\nFigure 4. Situational approval by experimental condition—conditional on militant assertiveness (Hawks vs. Doves).\nNote: This plot depicts estimates of the treatment effect of each experimental condition on presidential approval relative to the stay out condition. Estimates are based on an OLS model with interaction effects between tech literacy and each proxy experimental condition. Bars represent  $95\\%$  confidence intervals and dots depict estimate means.\n# Robustness Tests\nResearchers have critiqued the use of hypothetical presidential figures in international relations experiments on the basis that presidential evaluations are largely driven by partisan cues that are absent in fictitious vignettes (Croco et al. 2021). To test the robustness of the current results in face of this critique, the survey participants were asked, as the experiment continued, to view updated conflict scenarios that depicted President Biden and Iran as the relevant actors. The alternate dependent variables in this case asked about the level of approval of President Biden's handling of the situation and measured the named President's job approval. I analyze this alternative experimental structure in Online Appendix C, finding that the same results recur under both hypothetical and realistic character representations. The study findings are also robust when excluding participants who failed any of the attention checks that were administered following the experimental treatments.\nDiscussion\nThis article proposes that the emergence of cyber capabilities has altered the nature of domestic audience costs. By taking advantage of voters' captivation with cyber power, and their understandable if erroneous belief in the operational effectiveness of cyber capabilities, leaders can back down from international threats while still appearing strong in the eyes of domestic constituents. I verify this theory through a novel experimental design, which confirms that the public views even minor cyberattacks — an objective signal of restraint — as sufficiently forceful to meet a leader's threat of force and avoid any semblance of inconsistency.\nEven with a well-founded theory backed up by robust experimental evidence, we must be careful when generalizing controlled experimental results to real-world events. Voters don't evaluate presidential performance in the artificial environment of survey experiments, and military conflict rarely abides by such clearly delineated phases of threats and responses as laid out in simplified experimental scenarios (Gartzke and Lupu 2012). Therefore, it behooves us to look for real-world examples of cyber audience costs that can corroborate the theory. Even if we cannot isolate specific causal mechanisms when examining historical events, it would be highly suggestive were we to find corroborating examples where minor cyberattacks were advertised as demonstrations of strength to domestic audiences, even while they were objectively used to walk back threats of escalation. I offer two cases where this behavior can be partly observed.\nA first real-world example occurred on June 20, 2019, when Iran shot down a U.S. R1-4 Global Hawk UAV (Newman 2019). President Trump immediately and publicly threatened massive retaliatory military strikes against targets inside Iran, claiming that Iran faced “obliteration” for their acts. The threat was ignored by Iranian authorities who insisted that they would continue to shoot down any U.S. assets that entered Iranian airspace (Pickrell 2019). Yet even after publicly issuing a threat, President Trump backed down from the initial threat, sufficing with a series of cyberattacks that disabled Iran's ability to track ships in the region and compromised Iran's missile defense systems (Valeriano and Jensen 2022).\nFrom every possible angle, it is indisputable that President Trump walked back his initial threat, setting in place the precise conditions that should give rise to critical domestic censure and generate inconsistency costs. In lieu of the promised “obliteration,” the American response de-escalated the situation by conducting a relatively minor cyberattack that signaled restraint. The cyberattack was effectively used as an off-ramp to avoid a dangerous escalation of hostilities (Valeriano and Jensen 2022), and indeed this cycle of hostilities came to an end.\nYet to the domestic public, the restrained cyberattack was not viewed as a capitulation. Even though the attack objectively failed to meet the severity of the initial promise to “obliterate” Iran, the cyberattack was still viewed as a signal of strength and resolve. Comparing polls taken immediately prior and following the incident, President Trump suffered no situational disapproval or lowered confidence in voters' perceptions of his ability to handle the situation in Iran (Pew Research Center 2019). In fact, the Trump administration may have exploited the secrecy that is inherently connected with cyber operations to inflate voters' beliefs about the attack's impact (Baram 2023, 2022). By emphasizing the covertness of the attack and the ambiguity associated with the effects, media coverage of the incident likely inflated public perceptions about the severity of the muted cyberattack.\nA similar scenario played out in Israel one year later. During April 2020, Iranian hackers infiltrated the systems of an Israeli water plant (Times of Israel 2020). The hackers sought to cripple computer systems that controlled water flow and raise the level of chlorine within the water mix that was distributed to Israeli homes. The incident was thwarted before it could cause major damage, though it sent shivers down the country's spine. Israeli citizens were baying for blood, and Israeli leadership declared that the targeting of civilian infrastructure was a “red line” that warranted swift, decisive, and massive retaliation.\nYet massive retaliation did not arrive. Instead, Israel conducted a rather innocuous cyber operation targeting Iran's Shahid Rajaee port, causing a temporary traffic jam among commercial shipping vehicles (Warrick and Nakashima 2020). To the Iranians and to the international community who were working to avoid any military escalation, the limited Israeli cyberattack marked an end to fears of impending war. Yet to Israeli civilians, the cyberattack was trumpeted as a remarkable sign of Israeli cyber prowess and a blow to the Iranian regime (Baram 2023). Once again, a country's leadership could have their cake and eat it too, appearing strong to domestic audiences while backing down from military escalation.\nZooming out, this study bears implications on three different aspects of conflict — the escalatory properties of cyber power, the efficacy of conflict signaling in the cyber age, and the role of public opinion in foreign affairs. First, regarding the debate over the escalatory dynamics of cyber operations, we can now add a small weight on the de-escalatory side of the scale. It was once thought that public exposure to frightening cyberattacks would cause mass demands for retaliation, generating\nescalatory pressure on leaders who must be responsive to public sentiment (Shandler, Gross, and Canetti 2022). Yet this idea has been refuted (Kreps and Schneider 2019), and the evidence now suggests that public opinion adds de-escalatory pressures to cyber operations, granting leaders the ability to act with restraint without worrying about militant domestic blowback.\nSecond, what does this finding mean for the future of conflict signaling? Credibility lies at the core of international relations, and leaders have developed sophisticated methods to send signals that overcome a built-in credibility deficit — the most famous of which are costly signaling. Yet according to this paper, rivals can no longer trust purportedly costly tied-hands signals if they know that the signaling leaders possess a path of action that allows them to avoid the imposition of audience costs - even if they back down from their threat. Absent any compensatory mechanisms, the reduced effectiveness of costly signaling will insert significant uncertainty into crisis bargaining and increase skepticism about the authenticity of military threats.\nOne option to salvage this popular form of signaling may be to issue more specific and severe threats. As a rule, leaders prefer to keep their options open by issuing general threats (Quek and Johnston 2018; Snyder and Borghard 2011). Yet the advent of cyber circumvention strategies may require that future threats become more specific in order to maintain their previous levels of credibility. For officials seeking to impose audience costs, they may now be required to declare that the United States Army will send ground forces from a particular unit to secure a site, or that the U.S. Air Force will launch specific missiles if a rival doesn't back down, since only highly specific guarantees can ensure that a cyber-attack will be perceived as inconsistent with the threats. Alternatively, leaders may be forced to rely on alternative signaling techniques, reweighing the form and balance of their signaling communications. While tied-hands signals are commonly conceived as being the most effective method of conveying intentions (Fearon 1997), leaders possess an arsenal of other techniques at their disposal that may now become more popular (Quek 2021).\nLast, regarding public opinion, we gain yet another piece of evidence attesting to the consequentiality of public opinion toward cyber operations. It is easy to dismiss the relevance of public opinion when it comes to international relations. Intricate dynamics of international conflict tend to take place above the heads of regular voters, who have historically deferred to elites in such matters (Berinsky 2009). Yet research consistently shows that public opinion can have a small yet meaningful effect on conflict decision-making (Sevenans 2021; Lin-Greenberg 2021; Tomz and Weeks 2020). This is especially the case when it comes to cyber power, and leaders must be attuned to public attitudes. We already know that public\nexposure to incoming cyberattacks can manifest major political consequences (Shandler, Gross, and Canetti 2023), and now we see that the reverse is true as well — that public enthusiasm for outgoing cyber operations can generate new conflict dynamics. It is a lessen well worth learning that public opinion matters in cyber conflict.\nI end by noting several research limitations that deserve attention. Most conspicuously, the phases of the experimental game — wherein a leader issues a threat, awaits a response, and then decides how to react — is but one of many possible scenarios in which cyber operations might be deployed. This echoes a frequent critique that audience cost experiments lack ecological validity (Snyder and Borghard 2011). While conceding that future research should examine the veracity of the findings under different scenarios, the core finding — that domestic audiences view cyberattacks as a demonstration of forceful leadership — is not reliant on the particular circumstances of this or any other study's experimental setup. The present study would also benefit from complementary research into how elites and foreign states view cyber operations. The ability of leaders to de-escalate conflict while still appearing strong in the eyes of domestic constituents is reliant on the fact that foreign actors will indeed view cyber operations as an act of restraint. To date, this second half of the equation is surmised on the basis of extensive observational and experimental studies that have accumulated in the literature (Jensen, Valeriano, and Whitt 2024; Lin-Greenberg 2023; Kostyuk and Gartzke 2022; Maschmeyer and Dunn Cavelty 2022; Gomez and Whyte 2020). Corroborating this component with robust experimental data would provide a fuller picture showing how different stakeholders perceived cyber capabilities, and how these perceptions are strategically consequential.\nI gratefully acknowledge the valuable feedback offered by colleagues and friends, among them: Daphna Canetti, Andres Gannon, Miguel Gomez, Erik Lin-Greenberg, Michael Gross, Nadiya Kostyuk, Harry Oppenheimer, Jordan Tama, Brandon Valeriano, and Christopher Whyte. The paper benefited greatly from comments offered at the 2023 Cyber Escalation in Conflict workshop hosted by Erik Gartzke, Jelena Vićić, and Gil Baram, and at the ISA 2022 Annual Conference.

En exploitant la fascination des électeurs pour le cyberconflit, les dirigeants peuvent désormais désamorcer les crises en toute sécurité, sans avoir à craindre une censure nationale. Tel est l'attrait du cyberpouvoir chez le grand public que même des cyberattaques mineures, aux conséquences opérationnelles faibles, peuvent apaiser l'attente d'une puissante force militaire chez les électeurs. En pratique, cela signifie que les dirigeants qui seraient sinon tenus par des coûts d'audience nationaux peuvent y « échapper » en menant des cyberattaques à l'efficacité superficielle, mais suffisante pour les électeurs nationaux. Pour explorer la modération des pressions d'escalade nationales grâce aux cyberopérations, je mène une expérience de sondage qui demande aux participants d'évaluer les qualités de dirigeant de leur président après le déploiement d'une cyberforce ou d'une force conventionnelle. Les résultats confirment que le public considère les cyberattaques, même si elles sont éphémères et exemptes de conséquences, comme étant suffisamment vigoureuses pour répondre aux menaces de recours à la force d'un dirigeant et apaiser ses envies d'actions militaires. En proposant des exemples concrets de cette théorie dans de nombreux incidents du monde réels, je démontre que l'enthousiasme du public pour le cyberpouvoir ajoute une toute nouvelle flexibilité à la prise de décisions par temps de crise.\n## Introduction\nVoters are enthralled by cyber power. In the eyes of the public, cyber power is an almighty technological weapon that can pierce through enemy defenses — leaving a trail of destruction in its inscrutable wake (Shandler, Gross, and Canetti 2021). Cyberattacks arouse severe anxiety when turned against us , and they foster keen enthusiasm when used against our adversaries . These beliefs about cyber power are, of course, steeped in hyperbole — yet they are earnestly held by a credulous public who are buffeted by a constant din of sensationalist media reporting of cyber doom narratives (Makridis, Maschmeyer, and Smeets 2024; Lawson 2019). The disjoint between perception and reality presents political leaders with an opportunity to appear strong without taking strong action. Applying a framework of domestic audience\ncosts , I demonstrate how the allure of cyber power allows leaders to back down from explicit threats without suffering domestic censure. This finding reimagines the logic of audience costs for a digital age.\nDomestic politics and public opinion are integral features of many modern theories of international conflict . Democratic leaders pay keen attention to voters' attitudes toward war, with public opinion capable of acting as a constraint on escalation , or a spur that pushes leaders to retaliate . When it comes to cyber power, it was once thought that public engagement with cyberattacks would manifest in the latter category — adding escalatory momentum to conflict situations. So the thinking went, widespread exposure to frightening cyberattacks would lead to mass demands for retaliation, generating escalatory tailwinds and encouraging leaders to respond with any means necessary . Yet the reality turned out to be far more muted. The ambiguity and uncertainty associated with cyber threats undercut public support for retaliation (Jardine, Porter, and Shandler 2024), and predominantly subversive cyber operations failed to evoke the level of destructiveness that would generate domestic political pressure to engage in military action .\nThis article reimagines the effect of voters' captivation with cyber power, arguing that it acts as a check on conflict escalation by adding flexibility to crisis decision making. By exploiting the public enthusiasm for cyber force, leaders can safely de-escalate crisis situations without worrying about suffering domestic censure . I argue that when states conduct cyber operations, the domestic public are likely to view the use of cyberattacks as a strong sign of resolve — even if the effectiveness of the cyberattack is objectively limited. Essentially, cyber power enables leaders to de-escalate conflict without having to worry about suffering domestic censure for acting weakly or inconsistently on the international stage.\nUnderstanding the interplay between public opinion and cyber conflict requires that we descend from an international level of analysis, where most escalation debates play out, to an individual level of analysis grounded in political psychology and lay perceptions. In answering why low-cost, non-destructive cyber operations would ever be sufficient to placate hawkish domestic audiences  — the answer lies not in theories of signaling or compellence, but in theories of public opinion. Interpreting the impact of public opinion on foreign affairs requires that we interrogate the psychological and cognitive dimensions of cyber conflict, not its strategic impact.\nTo test whether cyber operations can truly temper domestic escalatory pressures, I conduct a survey experiment with a sample of American voters that asks participants to evaluate presidential leadership following the\ndeployment of cyber or conventional force. The experimental findings confirm that the public view cyberattacks — even ephemeral, inconsequential cyberattacks — as sufficiently forceful to meet a leader's threat of force and placate any public zeal for vengeance. I further verify that the results transcend partisan affiliation and recur at all levels of technological literacy.\nThese findings demonstrate how public perceptions of cyber power adds newfound flexibility to crisis decision making. By exploiting the public enthusiasm for cyber force, leaders can safely de-escalate crisis situations while maintaining a seemingly muscular foreign policy posture in the eyes of their domestic constituents. In the subsequent sections, I begin by laying out the foundations of public attitudes toward cyber conflict. After introducing the conceptual foundation, I present a novel experimental design and a set of results that verify the theory using the well-worn technique of audience-cost experiments. Last, I discuss the implications of the findings, and offer examples of how this theory has played out in real world incidents.\n## Voters' Perceptions of Cyber Power—A Terrifyingly Effective Domain\nPerceptions of cyber power are rooted in fear and emotions (Shandler, Snider, et al. 2022). A growing set of experimental works has demonstrated that voters experience mental anguish in the aftermath of cyberattacks. Exposure to even benign cyberattacks triggers spikes in stress and anxiety , threat perception , anger (Shandler, Gross, and Canetti 2022), dread , and a willingness to sacrifice civil liberties to protect against future attacks .\nThis inflated sense of threat among the public is driven by several features that are specific to cyberspace. The anonymity and mystique that are commonly associated with cyberspace exacerbate negative psychological responses, with unknown and seemingly omniscient perpetrators creating an environment of panic and helplessness (Dunn Cavelty 2012; Hansen and Nissenbaum 2009; Gomez and Whyte 2021). Moreover, the public's lack of technical sophistication when it comes to cyber threats ferments feelings of dread, a trend that is magnified by the constant exposure to seemingly irrepressible cyberattacks on a growing array of devices .\nMuch of the hyperbolic views of omnipotent and destructive cyber actors can be traced to sensationalized media coverage and popular culture depictions of cyber power . This dramatized coverage has come to be known as the “cyber doom narrative,” a teleological expectation that digital insecurity will inevitably result in mass societal collapse as our growing dependence on digital systems renders us vulnerable\nto attacks . Having been emotionally primed to experience dread, anxiety, and helplessness in the face of cyberattacks, it is no wonder that the public is liable to buy into the pervasive cultural narrative surrounding cyber threats. As a case in point, a field study of a mundane ransomware attack against a hospital in Germany revealed intense public anxiety, and a steep fall in voters' trust in their government, despite authorities' attempts to calm the jittery residents .\nWhile the public has developed a deep trepidation towards the destructive potential of cyber threats, it has, by the same logic, warmly embraced cyberattacks as an effective military offensive option. A series of experiments across multiple countries has observed a consistently high level of public enthusiasm for employing cyberattacks to respond to national security threats . Voters are enthused by the perceived capacity of cyberattacks as an operationally effective attack option that avoids placing troops in harm's way and which minimizes civilian casualties (Demarest, Jost, and Schub 2024). Even in response to the most egregious and deadly attacks, the public views cyberattacks as being a highly effective and appropriate retaliatory option (Gross, Canetti, and Vashdi 2017; Jardine et al. 2024).\nPublic beliefs about cyber power are made salient by the fact that cyber operations are now widely publicized. In the past, cyber operations were famous for taking place under a cloak of anonymity. Yet in recent years, there has been a distinct trend towards public disclosure of cyberattacks wherein authorities willingly publicize what were once secretive cyber operations . Leaders opt to openly divulge cyber operations to signal strength and prestige to external audiences , to legitimize investments in the cyber domain , and to undermine rivals' trust in technology infrastructure . This article reinforces an additional rationale for self-attribution, which is signaling strength and resolve to domestic audiences who are galvanized by displays of military force in general, and cyber-force in particular .\nIt would be understandable at this point for readers to protest that: public perceptions about cyber power are simply incorrect. I agree - public beliefs about cyber power do not necessarily match its constrained reality. Among military officials and cyber experts, the prevailing view holds that cyber power is incapable of independently effecting strategic outcomes, and that it is primarily effective as a force amplifier in coordination with conventional military forces (Valeriano, Jensen, and Maness 2018), or as an act of sub-crisis maneuvering that operates below the threshold of conflict . Nevertheless, the disjoint between public perceptions of cyber strength and the reality of its constrained effectiveness is precisely the phenomenon that creates a strategic opportunity for leaders to overcome domestic escalatory pressure.\nSpecifically, this paper targets two gaps in the cyber conflict literature that remain understudied. Much of the existing research on cyber power is dedicated to scrutinizing the objective effects and effectiveness of cyber operations. However, it is imperative that we also recognize the impact of (oftentimes distorted) perceptions about cyber power. Beliefs about cyber capabilities, even if untethered from reality, shape behavior and decision-making in real ways. Additionally, the accumulating research on public opinion and cyber power must take a final step to interrogate the strategic impact of public attitudes and beliefs. To date, mounting empirical research has demonstrated that cyberattacks roil public beliefs about international affairs and arouse strong emotional reactions . The missing step is to connect these public responses to concrete political outcomes to make the case of why public opinion matters. In the next section, we take this leap by interpreting public opinion through the prism of domestic audience costs.\n## Interpreting Cyber Operations Through the Lens of Audience Costs\nTo briefly revisit the main tenets of audience cost theory, governments manufacture domestic audience costs to credibly communicate resolve to actors in the international arena. By publicly threatening to employ military force, leaders add credibility to their signals, since both parties to the conflict are aware that domestic constituencies punish governments that say one thing and do another . The presence of audience costs transforms public threats from cheap talk into informative signals. According to the basic precepts of this theory, when a rival refuses to accede to a threat underpinned by audience costs, a leader has two principal options: to follow through on the threat and so escalate the conflict, or to back down from the threat and suffer domestic censure.\nCyber operations challenge this basic theory. What if there was an option for leaders to publicly issue a threat (an ostensibly costly signal), and yet avoid the imposition of audience costs were they to back down? I argue that cyberattacks can strike this delicate balance. To the domestic audience, wielding cyber power sends a message of strength since the public holds clear (if exaggerated) beliefs about the value and effectiveness of cyber power. Importantly, this domestically targeted message of strength is untethered to the operational effects produced by cyberattacks. As such, even minor cyberattacks with little operational or escalatory impact can placate voters' expectation of “strong” military resolve.\nINTERNATIONAL INTERACTIONS\n#\nIn Figure 1, I visualize an updated crisis bargaining model that newly incorporates cyberattacks as a distinct military option. The figure reimagines the traditional decision tree associated with audience cost theories, with the addition of a new option (D) depicted in blue. The scenario depicts a crisis between two players — who we can think of as a country (1) and a foreign rival (2). The game progresses with the country deciding at the first phase whether to publicly threaten the use of force against the foreign rival in attempt to achieve a strategic objective. If the country refrains from making any threat — then the scenario ends with them having decided to (A) stay out of the crisis. If the country issues a threat, and the foreign rival does not concede, then the onus moves back to the country to decide whether to (B) back down from their threat, or (C) follow through on their threat. Audience cost models are principally\nFigure 1. Updated crisis bargaining model with new cyberattack option.\nNote: The figure reflects the crisis scenario with expected domestic and strategic payoffs for player 1 presented under each terminal node. Ticks reflect the optimal outcomes, with no audience costs being preferred to the sufferance of audience costs, and de-escalation being preferred to military escalation. Only decision (D) leads to a situation where no audience costs are suffered and the crisis is de-escalated.\n|   | (B) Backs Down | (C) Follows Through | (D) Cyber Attack  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  Domestic Audience Cost: | Suffers Audience Cost | No Audience Cost | No Audience Cost  |\n|  Crisis Outcome: | De-Escalation | Military Escalation | De-Escalation  |\nconcerned with the difference between staying out and backing down, since publics demonstrably punish leaders who renege on their commitments.\nUntil now, these first options reflect the typical crisis bargaining model. Each of options (B) and (C) yields a negative consequence. By backing down from a threat, a government can refrain from unwanted military escalation, but will suffer a drop in public approval as their domestic constituents punish them for acting inconsistently and weakly . Alternatively, by following through and engaging in military action, a government can avoid domestic denunciation, but must prepare for a military conflagration whose consequences are unknown. We now add an additional avenue of action (D) — which depicts a government decision to conduct a cyberattack.\nBased on the above analysis describing how voters perceive cyber power, we can expect that employing a cyberattack allows the government player to mitigate any negative consequences — epitomizing a digital get out jail free card. The evidence suggests that cyber operations conducted in isolation are not a replacement for conventional warfare , and they are unlikely to engender escalatory consequences (Jensen, Valeriano, and Whitt 2024; Lin-Greenberg 2023; Libicki 2020; Fischerkeller and Harknett 2017). Yet from the perspective of the public, the cyberattack would be viewed as an act of force and a clear expression of intent. Seeing as the public view cyberspace as an effective operational domain, comparable to air and land power, launching a cyberattack meets the initial promise of force and allays any modicum of inconsistency that would give rise to audience costs. The country's leader, in this scenario, has the best of both worlds — they have backed down from a potentially escalatory conflict situation while avoiding domestic political consequences.\nAdmittedly, this logical chain of events represents just one scenario in which offensive cyber operations might be used in conflict settings. Nevertheless, this model of crisis bargaining has served to theorize about leader's decision making for decades, and there is value in overlaying cyber operations on a well-formed model of international relations. Our central focus of interest is whether benign cyber operations can effectively send signals of strength to domestic audiences. On this basis, I put forward the following testable hypothesis: cyberattacks, even those with limited operational effects, will be interpreted as a signal of strength and an effective projection of force by domestic audiences.\n## Experimental Methodology\nTo test the above theoretical framework, I employ a well-trodden pathway for experimentally examining audience costs that relies on original survey\nINTERNATIONAL INTERACTIONS\n#\nexperiments. Since Tomz (2007) first introduced a technique to empirically scrutinize the phenomenon, a series of subsequent experiments have corroborated its veracity and successfully replicated and extended the inherent logic of audience costs . This experimental approach has proven popular because selection biases mean that audience costs are difficulty to study through observational data. $^{1}$\nThe experimental design involved fielding an online survey experiment in March 2021 on a national sample of 960 Americans recruited using the Prolific Survey Panel. The study respondents represented a cross-section of the general population (mean age = 35 years, SD = 12.9). The sample's political orientation leans slightly to the left, with 56% of respondents self-identifying as progressive, while the gender distribution is exactly 50% male and female. Since the purpose of the study is to challenge the conventional logic of audience costs, the structure of the experiment draws heavily from the setup introduced in Tomz's (2007) audience cost study, which has been subject to extensive corroboration and replication. All research design and hypotheses were pre-registered prior to data collection.\nTo begin, all respondents were introduced to a scenario according to which \"a foreign country sent its military to take over a territorial region of its neighboring country.\" Respondents were then randomly assigned to one of five treatment conditions (see Table 1) that varied whether or not the U.S. president threatened to intervene and use force, and whether the president followed through on the threat in one way or another. In the stay out condition, which acts as a control group, the president pledges to stay out of the conflict, and indeed refrains from engaging in any conflict. In the other four treatment groups, respondents are told that \"the U.S. president declared that if the attacking country continues to invade, the U.S. military would immediately engage and attempt to push out the\n$^{1}$ I acknowledge a resilient school of thought that casts doubt on the empirical validity and theoretical persuasiveness of the phenomenon. One group of critics claim that artificially constructed experimental scenarios lack ecological and external validity since leaders allegedly fail to issue explicit threats,  or because fictional experiments overstate the costs that respondents impose on real leaders . Another group of critics posit that the absence of real-world crises with corresponding audience cost outcomes calls into question the external validity of this theory . While conceding the need to carefully construct experimental techniques that mimic real-world scenarios, I suggest that real-world events needn't accord precisely with the phased layout of the experimental structure for us to learn valuable lessons.\n$^{2}$ While all online survey panels have a mixed reputation regarding the representativeness of their participant pools, research has shown that the Prolific panel is superior in terms of the comprehension, attention, and honesty of responses compared to other panels (Douglas, Ewell, and Brauer 2023; Eyal et al. 2021).\n$^{3}$ The research design was approved by the Research Ethics (IRB) Committee of the authors' institution (approval # 120/21).\n#\nR. SHANDLER\nTable 1. Description of treatment conditions.\n|  Treatment condition | N | Presidential threat / declaration | Implemented action  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  Stay out | 190 | The president declared that the U.S. would stay out of the conflict. | The U.S. refrained from engaging in the conflict.  |\n|  Back down | 210 | The president threatened that the U.S. military would engage and push out the attacking country | The U.S. backed down and did not engage the attacking country in any way.  |\n|  Engage militarily (Follow Through) | 175 | The president threatened that the U.S. military would engage and push out the attacking country | Deployed grounds troops against the attacking country  |\n|  Major (degradative) cyberattack | 181 | The president threatened that the U.S. military would engage and push out the attacking country | Major degradative cyberattack that crippled the attacking force's communication networks and rendered its radar system inoperable  |\n|  Minor (disruptive) cyberattack | 204 | The president threatened that the U.S. military would engage and push out the attacking country | Minor disruptive cyberattack that slowed the attacker's digital systems and publicized sensitive personnel files.  |\nattacking country.\" In each of these four conditions, the scenario continues with the president either backing down from the threat and abstaining from any military action (back down condition), deploying ground troops against the attacking country (engage militarily condition), employing major degradative cyberattacks that operationally cripple the attacking country's military forces (major cyberattack condition), or employing minor disruptive cyberattacks that cause temporary disruptions to the attacking country's digital systems (minor cyberattack condition). The full survey instruments appear in Online Appendix A, along with balance tables and treatment randomization checks.\nConsistent with other iterations of this experimental structure, I control for outcomes by ensuring that all treatment conditions lead to the same endpoint, with the hostile state gaining  $20\\%$  of the contested territory regardless of whether the President engages or stays out . Likewise, seeing as domestic casualties are a central guiding factor in military approval, I control for this by ensuring that the United States experiences zero casualties in any scenario.4\nFollowing exposure to one of the conflict conditions, which was reinforced through a series of attention checks, I measured the dependent variable of interest by asking participants whether they approved or disapproved of the way the President handled the situation on a seven-point scale. Additionally, I collected data on respondents' dispositional\nINTERNATIONAL INTERACTIONS\n#\ncharacteristics such as militant assertiveness using a scale developed by Herrmann, Tetlock, and Visser (1999), international trust via a measured produced by Brewer (2004), and political ideology using the standard measure from the American National Election Studies. I further collected a comprehensive battery of demographic characteristics, including gender, employment, age, level of education, and technological literacy. Information on the scales and sources of all collected measures appears in the Online Appendix.\n# Results\nTo assess how use of force decisions give rise to audience costs, Figure 2 reveals the average treatment effect of each experimental condition on presidential approval. The average treatment effect consists of a regression coefficient estimate for each proxy treatment group when compared to the baseline \"Stay Out\" condition. $^{6}$  For this first analysis, I combine the two cyberattacks treatments into one overarching cyber group to construct a general cyber effect.\nA number of results immediately leap out. First, similarly to all audience cost experiments, we can see that the typical audience cost effect (conceptualized as the effect of backing down from a commitment compared to staying out of the conflict) is negative, large, and statistically significant  $(\\beta = -1.622, p &lt; .000)$ . This finding rehashes the central tenet of domestic audience costs, showing that voters will punish a leader for issuing a threat to use force and then backing down. Likewise, we can be encouraged by the fact that the level of support for engaging militarily (and not acting inconsistently) also acts as expected, with no statistically significant difference between military engagement and staying out of the conflict  $(\\beta = .151, p = \\mathrm{n.s.})$ . Essentially, voters are looking for consistency; they will not punish the president for evincing a desire to stay out of the conflict and doing so, nor will they punish the president for making a threat and following through. Only backing down from an explicit threat leads to domestic censure.\nWhen turning to our primary variable of interest, the effect of conducting cyberattacks, we can observe a slight but statistically significant increase in presidential approval following a cyberattack, compared to the\n6The full regression output appears in Online Appendix E.\n7The belligerence cost effect is necessarily smaller than the audience cost effect, since inconsistent behavior makes up the majority of an audience cost . The public applies a belligerence cost due to disapproval of aggressive behavior, even if it is consistent with past promises. In the presented results, engaging militarily did not lead to any statistically significant decrease in public approval. This is consistent with past findings by Lin-Greenberg (2019) and Croco, Hanmer, and McDonald (2021), and contrasts with Kertzer and Brutger (2016) who identified a slight but statistically significant belligerence cost.\n#\nR. SHANDLER\nFigure 2. Situational approval by experimental condition.\nNote: This plot depicts estimates of the treatment effect of each experimental condition on presidential approval relative to the stay out condition.

Bars represent  $95\\%$  confidence intervals and dots depict estimate means.\nbaseline stay out condition ( $\\beta = .360$ ,  $p &lt; .019$ ). According to our conceptualization of this treatment, cyberattacks constitute a repudiation of the initial promise, almost akin to backing down. The president had declared that the U.S. military would actively engage and push out the attacking country's forces. Yet far from actualizing this commitment, the president contented with a single barrage of cyberattacks against the attacking country's forces that merely publicized sensitive information or targeted its radar systems. Neither action represents a level of military engagement sufficient to \"push back the attacking forces,\" and the rival country would certainly view such an attack as a token and de-escalatory signal. Yet even though this path of action represents the kind of inconsistency that should evoke domestic disapproval — as with the back down condition — the public actually reports a slight increase in approval. As theorized, it appears that that a leader can back down from a threat without suffering domestic\ncensure simply by deploying militarily trivial cyber operations that appear forceful to domestic constituents.\nA fact that adds credibility to this reading of the results is the fact that the public keenly distinguishes between greater and lesser military action. Lin-Greenberg (2019) found that leaders who committed to full military action can partially mitigate audience costs by deploying lesser attack techniques such as air-strikes or sanctions. Lin-Greenberg's alternative attack options fell somewhere in between realizing the full-throated military threat and completely backing down — and the public was able to discern this important distinction leading to lowered but not entirely mitigated audience costs. Yet in the case of cyberattacks, we don't see merely reduced audience costs, we see an actual increase in approval ratings. The study respondents viewed the cyberattack as a kept promise, even though its effectiveness is objectively limited. This accords with research by Shandler, Gross, and Canetti (2021) who revealed a strong public enthusiasm for cyber warfare on the basis of its being perceived as an operationally effective military option that minimizes friendly and collateral deaths.\n### Breaking Down Cyberattacks—Degradative Versus Disruptive Strikes\nTo add additional nuance to the analyses, and to avoid the critique of earlier audience cost experiments that oversimplified the choices available to leaders, I break down cyberattacks into degradative (major) cyberattacks and disruptive (minor) cyberattacks. Disruptive cyber techniques differ from degradative attacks in the permanence, the destructiveness, and the operational effectiveness of the attack. We could expect that the rarer, and more degradative cyberattacks are far likelier to be construed by the public as meeting the leader's initial promise of “military engagement that pushes back the attackers' forces.” Disruptive cyberattacks, by contrast, should not even come close to meeting this promise and should be viewed as wholly equivalent to backing down.\nIn Figure 3, I again illustrate the average treatment effect for each experimental condition, though this time dividing the previously uniform cyberattacks into degradative and disruptive cyberattacks. Furthermore, I add an interaction effect to account for the respondents' level of technological literacy. This heterogeneous factor is crucial for the subsequent analysis since research has consistently shown that people's level of digital sophistication guides their perceptions of the efficacy of cyber threats and operations .\n#\nR. SHANDLER\nFigure 3. Situational approval by experimental condition—conditional on technological literacy.\nNote: This plot depicts estimates of the treatment effect of each experimental condition on presidential approval relative to the stay out condition. Estimates are based on an OLS model with interaction effects between tech literacy and each proxy experimental condition. Bars represent  $95\\%$  confidence intervals and dots depict estimate means.\nFigure 3 reveals that no audience costs are levied for either degradative or disruptive attacks. In essence, the public perceives even minor cyberattacks that have no lasting operational benefits as meeting the commitment of leaders to \"push back an attacker.\" Critically, we can see that the wide-ranging approval of cyberattacks is not contingent on technological literacy. One would think that high-tech literacy respondents would be more aware of the limited effects produced by cyber operations and that this group would recognize that minor, disruptive cyber operations do not meet the promise of a strong military response — but even high-tech literacy respondents refrained from imposing audience costs on leaders who deployed cyberattacks in lieu of conventional force. Both technologically literate and illiterate respondents refrain from punishing a leader for employing cyber operations, granting presidential flexibility across the board.\nHeterogeneous Effects: Hawks and Doves\nAs a third analysis, I examine whether the cyber pathway of avoiding audience costs holds when viewed through the lens of political orientation. I take this step since studies have identified that the strength of audience costs is highly conditional upon political orientation . Kertzer and Brutger (2016) even found that hawks and doves apply audience costs for different reasons — with hawks primarily punishing inconsistency and doves punishing belligerence along with inconsistency.\nIn Figure 4, I once again illustrate the average treatment effect for each experimental condition, including an interaction effect to account for political orientation. Since we are dealing with foreign policy views, I use militant assertiveness to distinguish between hawkishness and dovishness, a measure that tests beliefs about the desirability and effectiveness of the use of force in foreign policy. This three-item scale, developed by Herrmann, Tetlock, and Visser (1999), is commonly used in experimental studies that focus on foreign policy attitudes rather than purely domestic political attitudes.\nThe results reveal that when it comes to backing down and engaging militarily, the participants act as expected. Doves apply a substantial audience cost that is made up of an inconsistency cost (49%) that censures the perceived inconsistency of the president's actions, and a belligerence cost (51%) that punishes the threats of force. Hawks, by contrast, apply a larger audience cost than doves, and this cost is made up entirely by the overwhelming aversion to the perceived inconsistency of the president's behavior (> 100%). Both hawks and doves impose audience costs, just for different reasons.\nBut how do these groups look upon the exercise of cyberattacks? Looking at Figure 4, we can see that both groups refrain from imposing any audience costs when leaders execute disruptive or degradative cyberattacks that depart from their initial promises. It appears that the use of cyberattacks moderates the extremities of the partisan divide over conducting military action. Looking at the “engage militarily” column, we can see that hawks reward leaders who engage in military action in accordance with their commitments, while doves punish leaders for their belligerence. Yet these extremes are visibly softened for both types of cyberattacks. Doves view the use of cyberattacks as less severe than conventional military engagements, and so the belligerence cost and the inconsistency cost disappear. Meanwhile, hawks are slightly less enamored of cyberattacks compared to conventional military attacks, but still find them to be sufficiently forceful to meet the initial promise and so avoid any semblance of inconsistency. Though there remain differences between these groups, cyberattacks demonstrate enormous promise in striking a middle ground that can assuage even the highly partisan perceptions of hawks and doves towards the use of force in conflict settings.\n#\nR. SHANDLER\nFigure 4. Situational approval by experimental condition—conditional on militant assertiveness (Hawks vs. Doves).\nNote: This plot depicts estimates of the treatment effect of each experimental condition on presidential approval relative to the stay out condition. Estimates are based on an OLS model with interaction effects between tech literacy and each proxy experimental condition. Bars represent  $95\\%$  confidence intervals and dots depict estimate means.\n# Robustness Tests\nResearchers have critiqued the use of hypothetical presidential figures in international relations experiments on the basis that presidential evaluations are largely driven by partisan cues that are absent in fictitious vignettes . To test the robustness of the current results in face of this critique, the survey participants were asked, as the experiment continued, to view updated conflict scenarios that depicted President Biden and Iran as the relevant actors. The alternate dependent variables in this case asked about the level of approval of President Biden's handling of the situation and measured the named President's job approval. I analyze this alternative experimental structure in Online Appendix C, finding that the same results recur under both hypothetical and realistic character representations. The study findings are also robust when excluding participants who failed any of the attention checks that were administered following the experimental treatments.\nDiscussion\nThis article proposes that the emergence of cyber capabilities has altered the nature of domestic audience costs. By taking advantage of voters' captivation with cyber power, and their understandable if erroneous belief in the operational effectiveness of cyber capabilities, leaders can back down from international threats while still appearing strong in the eyes of domestic constituents. I verify this theory through a novel experimental design, which confirms that the public views even minor cyberattacks — an objective signal of restraint — as sufficiently forceful to meet a leader's threat of force and avoid any semblance of inconsistency.\nEven with a well-founded theory backed up by robust experimental evidence, we must be careful when generalizing controlled experimental results to real-world events. Voters don't evaluate presidential performance in the artificial environment of survey experiments, and military conflict rarely abides by such clearly delineated phases of threats and responses as laid out in simplified experimental scenarios . Therefore, it behooves us to look for real-world examples of cyber audience costs that can corroborate the theory. Even if we cannot isolate specific causal mechanisms when examining historical events, it would be highly suggestive were we to find corroborating examples where minor cyberattacks were advertised as demonstrations of strength to domestic audiences, even while they were objectively used to walk back threats of escalation. I offer two cases where this behavior can be partly observed.\nA first real-world example occurred on June 20, 2019, when Iran shot down a U.S. R1-4 Global Hawk UAV . President Trump immediately and publicly threatened massive retaliatory military strikes against targets inside Iran, claiming that Iran faced “obliteration” for their acts. The threat was ignored by Iranian authorities who insisted that they would continue to shoot down any U.S. assets that entered Iranian airspace . Yet even after publicly issuing a threat, President Trump backed down from the initial threat, sufficing with a series of cyberattacks that disabled Iran's ability to track ships in the region and compromised Iran's missile defense systems .\nFrom every possible angle, it is indisputable that President Trump walked back his initial threat, setting in place the precise conditions that should give rise to critical domestic censure and generate inconsistency costs. In lieu of the promised “obliteration,” the American response de-escalated the situation by conducting a relatively minor cyberattack that signaled restraint. The cyberattack was effectively used as an off-ramp to avoid a dangerous escalation of hostilities , and indeed this cycle of hostilities came to an end.\nYet to the domestic public, the restrained cyberattack was not viewed as a capitulation. Even though the attack objectively failed to meet the severity of the initial promise to “obliterate” Iran, the cyberattack was still viewed as a signal of strength and resolve. Comparing polls taken immediately prior and following the incident, President Trump suffered no situational disapproval or lowered confidence in voters' perceptions of his ability to handle the situation in Iran (Pew Research Center 2019). In fact, the Trump administration may have exploited the secrecy that is inherently connected with cyber operations to inflate voters' beliefs about the attack's impact . By emphasizing the covertness of the attack and the ambiguity associated with the effects, media coverage of the incident likely inflated public perceptions about the severity of the muted cyberattack.\nA similar scenario played out in Israel one year later. During April 2020, Iranian hackers infiltrated the systems of an Israeli water plant (Times of Israel 2020). The hackers sought to cripple computer systems that controlled water flow and raise the level of chlorine within the water mix that was distributed to Israeli homes. The incident was thwarted before it could cause major damage, though it sent shivers down the country's spine. Israeli citizens were baying for blood, and Israeli leadership declared that the targeting of civilian infrastructure was a “red line” that warranted swift, decisive, and massive retaliation.\nYet massive retaliation did not arrive. Instead, Israel conducted a rather innocuous cyber operation targeting Iran's Shahid Rajaee port, causing a temporary traffic jam among commercial shipping vehicles . To the Iranians and to the international community who were working to avoid any military escalation, the limited Israeli cyberattack marked an end to fears of impending war. Yet to Israeli civilians, the cyberattack was trumpeted as a remarkable sign of Israeli cyber prowess and a blow to the Iranian regime . Once again, a country's leadership could have their cake and eat it too, appearing strong to domestic audiences while backing down from military escalation.\nZooming out, this study bears implications on three different aspects of conflict — the escalatory properties of cyber power, the efficacy of conflict signaling in the cyber age, and the role of public opinion in foreign affairs. First, regarding the debate over the escalatory dynamics of cyber operations, we can now add a small weight on the de-escalatory side of the scale. It was once thought that public exposure to frightening cyberattacks would cause mass demands for retaliation, generating\nescalatory pressure on leaders who must be responsive to public sentiment (Shandler, Gross, and Canetti 2022). Yet this idea has been refuted , and the evidence now suggests that public opinion adds de-escalatory pressures to cyber operations, granting leaders the ability to act with restraint without worrying about militant domestic blowback.\nSecond, what does this finding mean for the future of conflict signaling? Credibility lies at the core of international relations, and leaders have developed sophisticated methods to send signals that overcome a built-in credibility deficit — the most famous of which are costly signaling. Yet according to this paper, rivals can no longer trust purportedly costly tied-hands signals if they know that the signaling leaders possess a path of action that allows them to avoid the imposition of audience costs - even if they back down from their threat. Absent any compensatory mechanisms, the reduced effectiveness of costly signaling will insert significant uncertainty into crisis bargaining and increase skepticism about the authenticity of military threats.\nOne option to salvage this popular form of signaling may be to issue more specific and severe threats. As a rule, leaders prefer to keep their options open by issuing general threats . Yet the advent of cyber circumvention strategies may require that future threats become more specific in order to maintain their previous levels of credibility. For officials seeking to impose audience costs, they may now be required to declare that the United States Army will send ground forces from a particular unit to secure a site, or that the U.S. Air Force will launch specific missiles if a rival doesn't back down, since only highly specific guarantees can ensure that a cyber-attack will be perceived as inconsistent with the threats. Alternatively, leaders may be forced to rely on alternative signaling techniques, reweighing the form and balance of their signaling communications. While tied-hands signals are commonly conceived as being the most effective method of conveying intentions , leaders possess an arsenal of other techniques at their disposal that may now become more popular .\nLast, regarding public opinion, we gain yet another piece of evidence attesting to the consequentiality of public opinion toward cyber operations. It is easy to dismiss the relevance of public opinion when it comes to international relations. Intricate dynamics of international conflict tend to take place above the heads of regular voters, who have historically deferred to elites in such matters . Yet research consistently shows that public opinion can have a small yet meaningful effect on conflict decision-making . This is especially the case when it comes to cyber power, and leaders must be attuned to public attitudes. We already know that public\nexposure to incoming cyberattacks can manifest major political consequences (Shandler, Gross, and Canetti 2023), and now we see that the reverse is true as well — that public enthusiasm for outgoing cyber operations can generate new conflict dynamics. It is a lessen well worth learning that public opinion matters in cyber conflict.\nI end by noting several research limitations that deserve attention. Most conspicuously, the phases of the experimental game — wherein a leader issues a threat, awaits a response, and then decides how to react — is but one of many possible scenarios in which cyber operations might be deployed. This echoes a frequent critique that audience cost experiments lack ecological validity . While conceding that future research should examine the veracity of the findings under different scenarios, the core finding — that domestic audiences view cyberattacks as a demonstration of forceful leadership — is not reliant on the particular circumstances of this or any other study's experimental setup. The present study would also benefit from complementary research into how elites and foreign states view cyber operations. The ability of leaders to de-escalate conflict while still appearing strong in the eyes of domestic constituents is reliant on the fact that foreign actors will indeed view cyber operations as an act of restraint. To date, this second half of the equation is surmised on the basis of extensive observational and experimental studies that have accumulated in the literature (Jensen, Valeriano, and Whitt 2024; Lin-Greenberg 2023; Kostyuk and Gartzke 2022; Maschmeyer and Dunn Cavelty 2022; Gomez and Whyte 2020). Corroborating this component with robust experimental data would provide a fuller picture showing how different stakeholders perceived cyber capabilities, and how these perceptions are strategically consequential.\nI gratefully acknowledge the valuable feedback offered by colleagues and friends, among them: Daphna Canetti, Andres Gannon, Miguel Gomez, Erik Lin-Greenberg, Michael Gross, Nadiya Kostyuk, Harry Oppenheimer, Jordan Tama, Brandon Valeriano, and Christopher Whyte. The paper benefited greatly from comments offered at the 2023 Cyber Escalation in Conflict workshop hosted by Erik Gartzke, Jelena Vićić, and Gil Baram, and at the ISA 2022 Annual Conference.

In the eyes of the public, cyber power is an almighty technological weapon that can pierce through enemy defenses — leaving a trail of destruction in its inscrutable wake (Shandler, Gross, and Canetti 2021). Cyberattacks arouse severe anxiety when turned against us , and they foster keen enthusiasm when used against our adversaries . These beliefs about cyber power are, of course, steeped in hyperbole — yet they are earnestly held by a credulous public who are buffeted by a constant din of sensationalist media reporting of cyber doom narratives (Makridis, Maschmeyer, and Smeets 2024; Lawson 2019). The disjoint between perception and reality presents political leaders with an opportunity to appear strong without taking strong action. Applying a framework of domestic audience\ncosts , I demonstrate how the allure of cyber power allows leaders to back down from explicit threats without suffering domestic censure. This finding reimagines the logic of audience costs for a digital age.\nDomestic politics and public opinion are integral features of many modern theories of international conflict . Democratic leaders pay keen attention to voters' attitudes toward war, with public opinion capable of acting as a constraint on escalation , or a spur that pushes leaders to retaliate . When it comes to cyber power, it was once thought that public engagement with cyberattacks would manifest in the latter category — adding escalatory momentum to conflict situations. So the thinking went, widespread exposure to frightening cyberattacks would lead to mass demands for retaliation, generating escalatory tailwinds and encouraging leaders to respond with any means necessary . Yet the reality turned out to be far more muted. The ambiguity and uncertainty associated with cyber threats undercut public support for retaliation (Jardine, Porter, and Shandler 2024), and predominantly subversive cyber operations failed to evoke the level of destructiveness that would generate domestic political pressure to engage in military action .\nThis article reimagines the effect of voters' captivation with cyber power, arguing that it acts as a check on conflict escalation by adding flexibility to crisis decision making. By exploiting the public enthusiasm for cyber force, leaders can safely de-escalate crisis situations without worrying about suffering domestic censure . I argue that when states conduct cyber operations, the domestic public are likely to view the use of cyberattacks as a strong sign of resolve — even if the effectiveness of the cyberattack is objectively limited. Essentially, cyber power enables leaders to de-escalate conflict without having to worry about suffering domestic censure for acting weakly or inconsistently on the international stage.\nUnderstanding the interplay between public opinion and cyber conflict requires that we descend from an international level of analysis, where most escalation debates play out, to an individual level of analysis grounded in political psychology and lay perceptions. In answering why low-cost, non-destructive cyber operations would ever be sufficient to placate hawkish domestic audiences  — the answer lies not in theories of signaling or compellence, but in theories of public opinion. Interpreting the impact of public opinion on foreign affairs requires that we interrogate the psychological and cognitive dimensions of cyber conflict, not its strategic impact.\nTo test whether cyber operations can truly temper domestic escalatory pressures, I conduct a survey experiment with a sample of American voters that asks participants to evaluate presidential leadership following the\ndeployment of cyber or conventional force. The experimental findings confirm that the public view cyberattacks — even ephemeral, inconsequential cyberattacks — as sufficiently forceful to meet a leader's threat of force and placate any public zeal for vengeance. I further verify that the results transcend partisan affiliation and recur at all levels of technological literacy.\nThese findings demonstrate how public perceptions of cyber power adds newfound flexibility to crisis decision making. By exploiting the public enthusiasm for cyber force, leaders can safely de-escalate crisis situations while maintaining a seemingly muscular foreign policy posture in the eyes of their domestic constituents. In the subsequent sections, I begin by laying out the foundations of public attitudes toward cyber conflict. After introducing the conceptual foundation, I present a novel experimental design and a set of results that verify the theory using the well-worn technique of audience-cost experiments. Last, I discuss the implications of the findings, and offer examples of how this theory has played out in real world incidents.\n\n---\n\n## # Robustness Tests\n\nResearchers have critiqued the use of hypothetical presidential figures in international relations experiments on the basis that presidential evaluations are largely driven by partisan cues that are absent in fictitious vignettes . To test the robustness of the current results in face of this critique, the survey participants were asked, as the experiment continued, to view updated conflict scenarios that depicted President Biden and Iran as the relevant actors.

President Trump immediately and publicly threatened massive retaliatory military strikes against targets inside Iran, claiming that Iran faced “obliteration” for their acts. The threat was ignored by Iranian authorities who insisted that they would continue to shoot down any U.S. assets that entered Iranian airspace . Yet even after publicly issuing a threat, President Trump backed down from the initial threat, sufficing with a series of cyberattacks that disabled Iran's ability to track ships in the region and compromised Iran's missile defense systems .\nFrom every possible angle, it is indisputable that President Trump walked back his initial threat, setting in place the precise conditions that should give rise to critical domestic censure and generate inconsistency costs. In lieu of the promised “obliteration,” the American response de-escalated the situation by conducting a relatively minor cyberattack that signaled restraint. The cyberattack was effectively used as an off-ramp to avoid a dangerous escalation of hostilities , and indeed this cycle of hostilities came to an end.\nYet to the domestic public, the restrained cyberattack was not viewed as a capitulation. Even though the attack objectively failed to meet the severity of the initial promise to “obliterate” Iran, the cyberattack was still viewed as a signal of strength and resolve. Comparing polls taken immediately prior and following the incident, President Trump suffered no situational disapproval or lowered confidence in voters' perceptions of his ability to handle the situation in Iran (Pew Research Center 2019). In fact, the Trump administration may have exploited the secrecy that is inherently connected with cyber operations to inflate voters' beliefs about the attack's impact . By emphasizing the covertness of the attack and the ambiguity associated with the effects, media coverage of the incident likely inflated public perceptions about the severity of the muted cyberattack.\nA similar scenario played out in Israel one year later. During April 2020, Iranian hackers infiltrated the systems of an Israeli water plant (Times of Israel 2020). The hackers sought to cripple computer systems that controlled water flow and raise the level of chlorine within the water mix that was distributed to Israeli homes. The incident was thwarted before it could cause major damage, though it sent shivers down the country's spine. Israeli citizens were baying for blood, and Israeli leadership declared that the targeting of civilian infrastructure was a “red line” that warranted swift, decisive, and massive retaliation.\nYet massive retaliation did not arrive. Instead, Israel conducted a rather innocuous cyber operation targeting Iran's Shahid Rajaee port, causing a temporary traffic jam among commercial shipping vehicles . To the Iranians and to the international community who were working to avoid any military escalation, the limited Israeli cyberattack marked an end to fears of impending war. Yet to Israeli civilians, the cyberattack was trumpeted as a remarkable sign of Israeli cyber prowess and a blow to the Iranian regime . Once again, a country's leadership could have their cake and eat it too, appearing strong to domestic audiences while backing down from military escalation.\nZooming out, this study bears implications on three different aspects of conflict — the escalatory properties of cyber power, the efficacy of conflict signaling in the cyber age, and the role of public opinion in foreign affairs. First, regarding the debate over the escalatory dynamics of cyber operations, we can now add a small weight on the de-escalatory side of the scale. It was once thought that public exposure to frightening cyberattacks would cause mass demands for retaliation, generating\nescalatory pressure on leaders who must be responsive to public sentiment (Shandler, Gross, and Canetti 2022). Yet this idea has been refuted , and the evidence now suggests that public opinion adds de-escalatory pressures to cyber operations, granting leaders the ability to act with restraint without worrying about militant domestic blowback.\nSecond, what does this finding mean for the future of conflict signaling? Credibility lies at the core of international relations, and leaders have developed sophisticated methods to send signals that overcome a built-in credibility deficit — the most famous of which are costly signaling. Yet according to this paper, rivals can no longer trust purportedly costly tied-hands signals if they know that the signaling leaders possess a path of action that allows them to avoid the imposition of audience costs - even if they back down from their threat. Absent any compensatory mechanisms, the reduced effectiveness of costly signaling will insert significant uncertainty into crisis bargaining and increase skepticism about the authenticity of military threats.\nOne option to salvage this popular form of signaling may be to issue more specific and severe threats. As a rule, leaders prefer to keep their options open by issuing general threats . Yet the advent of cyber circumvention strategies may require that future threats become more specific in order to maintain their previous levels of credibility. For officials seeking to impose audience costs, they may now be required to declare that the United States Army will send ground forces from a particular unit to secure a site, or that the U.S. Air Force will launch specific missiles if a rival doesn't back down, since only highly specific guarantees can ensure that a cyber-attack will be perceived as inconsistent with the threats. Alternatively, leaders may be forced to rely on alternative signaling techniques, reweighing the form and balance of their signaling communications. While tied-hands signals are commonly conceived as being the most effective method of conveying intentions , leaders possess an arsenal of other techniques at their disposal that may now become more popular .\nLast, regarding public opinion, we gain yet another piece of evidence attesting to the consequentiality of public opinion toward cyber operations. It is easy to dismiss the relevance of public opinion when it comes to international relations. Intricate dynamics of international conflict tend to take place above the heads of regular voters, who have historically deferred to elites in such matters . Yet research consistently shows that public opinion can have a small yet meaningful effect on conflict decision-making . This is especially the case when it comes to cyber power, and leaders must be attuned to public attitudes. We already know that public\nexposure to incoming cyberattacks can manifest major political consequences (Shandler, Gross, and Canetti 2023), and now we see that the reverse is true as well — that public enthusiasm for outgoing cyber operations can generate new conflict dynamics. It is a lessen well worth learning that public opinion matters in cyber conflict.\nI end by noting several research limitations that deserve attention. Most conspicuously, the phases of the experimental game — wherein a leader issues a threat, awaits a response, and then decides how to react — is but one of many possible scenarios in which cyber operations might be deployed. This echoes a frequent critique that audience cost experiments lack ecological validity . While conceding that future research should examine the veracity of the findings under different scenarios, the core finding — that domestic audiences view cyberattacks as a demonstration of forceful leadership — is not reliant on the particular circumstances of this or any other study's experimental setup. The present study would also benefit from complementary research into how elites and foreign states view cyber operations. The ability of leaders to de-escalate conflict while still appearing strong in the eyes of domestic constituents is reliant on the fact that foreign actors will indeed view cyber operations as an act of restraint. To date, this second half of the equation is surmised on the basis of extensive observational and experimental studies that have accumulated in the literature (Jensen, Valeriano, and Whitt 2024; Lin-Greenberg 2023; Kostyuk and Gartzke 2022; Maschmeyer and Dunn Cavelty 2022; Gomez and Whyte 2020). Corroborating this component with robust experimental data would provide a fuller picture showing how different stakeholders perceived cyber capabilities, and how these perceptions are strategically consequential.\nI gratefully acknowledge the valuable feedback offered by colleagues and friends, among them: Daphna Canetti, Andres Gannon, Miguel Gomez, Erik Lin-Greenberg, Michael Gross, Nadiya Kostyuk, Harry Oppenheimer, Jordan Tama, Brandon Valeriano, and Christopher Whyte. The paper benefited greatly from comments offered at the 2023 Cyber Escalation in Conflict workshop hosted by Erik Gartzke, Jelena Vićić, and Gil Baram, and at the ISA 2022 Annual Conference.

En exploitant la fascination des électeurs pour le cyberconflit, les dirigeants peuvent désormais désamorcer les crises en toute sécurité, sans avoir à craindre une censure nationale. Tel est l'attrait du cyberpouvoir chez le grand public que même des cyberattaques mineures, aux conséquences opérationnelles faibles, peuvent apaiser l'attente d'une puissante force militaire chez les électeurs. En pratique, cela signifie que les dirigeants qui seraient sinon tenus par des coûts d'audience nationaux peuvent y « échapper » en menant des cyberattaques à l'efficacité superficielle, mais suffisante pour les électeurs nationaux. Pour explorer la modération des pressions d'escalade nationales grâce aux cyberopérations, je mène une expérience de sondage qui demande aux participants d'évaluer les qualités de dirigeant de leur président après le déploiement d'une cyberforce ou d'une force conventionnelle. Les résultats confirment que le public considère les cyberattaques, même si elles sont éphémères et exemptes de conséquences, comme étant suffisamment vigoureuses pour répondre aux menaces de recours à la force d'un dirigeant et apaiser ses envies d'actions militaires. En proposant des exemples concrets de cette théorie dans de nombreux incidents du monde réels, je démontre que l'enthousiasme du public pour le cyberpouvoir ajoute une toute nouvelle flexibilité à la prise de décisions par temps de crise.\n\n## Introduction\n\nVoters are enthralled by cyber power. In the eyes of the public, cyber power is an almighty technological weapon that can pierce through enemy defenses — leaving a trail of destruction in its inscrutable wake (Shandler, Gross, and Canetti 2021). Cyberattacks arouse severe anxiety when turned against us (Backhaus et al. 2020), and they foster keen enthusiasm when used against our adversaries (Leal and Musgrave 2023). These beliefs about cyber power are, of course, steeped in hyperbole — yet they are earnestly held by a credulous public who are buffeted by a constant din of sensationalist media reporting of cyber doom narratives (Makridis, Maschmeyer, and Smeets 2024; Lawson 2019). The disjoint between perception and reality presents political leaders with an opportunity to appear strong without taking strong action. Applying a framework of domestic audience",
    "costs (Fearon 1994), I demonstrate how the allure of cyber power allows leaders to back down from explicit threats without suffering domestic censure. This finding reimagines the logic of audience costs for a digital age.\n\nDomestic politics and public opinion are integral features of many modern theories of international conflict (Kertzer 2023, 2018). Democratic leaders pay keen attention to voters' attitudes toward war, with public opinion capable of acting as a constraint on escalation (Baum and Potter 2015; Gelpi 2017), or a spur that pushes leaders to retaliate (Ribar 2021; Dafoe et al. 2022). When it comes to cyber power, it was once thought that public engagement with cyberattacks would manifest in the latter category — adding escalatory momentum to conflict situations. So the thinking went, widespread exposure to frightening cyberattacks would lead to mass demands for retaliation, generating escalatory tailwinds and encouraging leaders to respond with any means necessary (Leal and Musgrave 2023; Shandler, Gross, and Canetti 2022). Yet the reality turned out to be far more muted. The ambiguity and uncertainty associated with cyber threats undercut public support for retaliation (Jardine, Porter, and Shandler 2024), and predominantly subversive cyber operations failed to evoke the level of destructiveness that would generate domestic political pressure to engage in military action (Maschmeyer 2021, 2023).\n\nThis article reimagines the effect of voters' captivation with cyber power, arguing that it acts as a check on conflict escalation by adding flexibility to crisis decision making. By exploiting the public enthusiasm for cyber force, leaders can safely de-escalate crisis situations without worrying about suffering domestic censure (Lonergan and Lonergan 2022). I argue that when states conduct cyber operations, the domestic public are likely to view the use of cyberattacks as a strong sign of resolve — even if the effectiveness of the cyberattack is objectively limited. Essentially, cyber power enables leaders to de-escalate conflict without having to worry about suffering domestic censure for acting weakly or inconsistently on the international stage.\n\nUnderstanding the interplay between public opinion and cyber conflict requires that we descend from an international level of analysis, where most escalation debates play out, to an individual level of analysis grounded in political psychology and lay perceptions. In answering why low-cost, non-destructive cyber operations would ever be sufficient to placate hawkish domestic audiences (Yoder 2022) — the answer lies not in theories of signaling or compellence, but in theories of public opinion. Interpreting the impact of public opinion on foreign affairs requires that we interrogate the psychological and cognitive dimensions of cyber conflict, not its strategic impact.\n\nTo test whether cyber operations can truly temper domestic escalatory pressures, I conduct a survey experiment with a sample of American voters that asks participants to evaluate presidential leadership following the",
    "deployment of cyber or conventional force. The experimental findings confirm that the public view cyberattacks — even ephemeral, inconsequential cyberattacks — as sufficiently forceful to meet a leader's threat of force and placate any public zeal for vengeance. I further verify that the results transcend partisan affiliation and recur at all levels of technological literacy.\n\nThese findings demonstrate how public perceptions of cyber power adds newfound flexibility to crisis decision making. By exploiting the public enthusiasm for cyber force, leaders can safely de-escalate crisis situations while maintaining a seemingly muscular foreign policy posture in the eyes of their domestic constituents. In the subsequent sections, I begin by laying out the foundations of public attitudes toward cyber conflict. After introducing the conceptual foundation, I present a novel experimental design and a set of results that verify the theory using the well-worn technique of audience-cost experiments. Last, I discuss the implications of the findings, and offer examples of how this theory has played out in real world incidents.\n\n## Voters' Perceptions of Cyber Power—A Terrifyingly Effective Domain\n\nPerceptions of cyber power are rooted in fear and emotions (Shandler, Snider, et al. 2022). A growing set of experimental works has demonstrated that voters experience mental anguish in the aftermath of cyberattacks. Exposure to even benign cyberattacks triggers spikes in stress and anxiety (Backhaus et al. 2020), threat perception (Snider et al. 2021; Gross et al. 2017), anger (Shandler, Gross, and Canetti 2022), dread (Gomez and Villar 2018; Shandler and Gomez 2023), and a willingness to sacrifice civil liberties to protect against future attacks (Snider et al. 2025; Snider et al. 2021).\n\nThis inflated sense of threat among the public is driven by several features that are specific to cyberspace. The anonymity and mystique that are commonly associated with cyberspace exacerbate negative psychological responses, with unknown and seemingly omniscient perpetrators creating an environment of panic and helplessness (Dunn Cavelty 2012; Hansen and Nissenbaum 2009; Gomez and Whyte 2021). Moreover, the public's lack of technical sophistication when it comes to cyber threats ferments feelings of dread, a trend that is magnified by the constant exposure to seemingly irrepressible cyberattacks on a growing array of devices (Gomez and Villar 2018; Bada and Nurse 2020; McDermott 2019).\n\nMuch of the hyperbolic views of omnipotent and destructive cyber actors can be traced to sensationalized media coverage and popular culture depictions of cyber power (Lawson 2019; Dunn Cavelty 2019). This dramatized coverage has come to be known as the “cyber doom narrative,” a teleological expectation that digital insecurity will inevitably result in mass societal collapse as our growing dependence on digital systems renders us vulnerable",
    "to attacks (Gomez and Whyte 2021; Hansen and Nissenbaum 2009). Having been emotionally primed to experience dread, anxiety, and helplessness in the face of cyberattacks, it is no wonder that the public is liable to buy into the pervasive cultural narrative surrounding cyber threats. As a case in point, a field study of a mundane ransomware attack against a hospital in Germany revealed intense public anxiety, and a steep fall in voters' trust in their government, despite authorities' attempts to calm the jittery residents (Shandler and Gomez 2023; Gomez and Shandler 2024).\n\nWhile the public has developed a deep trepidation towards the destructive potential of cyber threats, it has, by the same logic, warmly embraced cyberattacks as an effective military offensive option. A series of experiments across multiple countries has observed a consistently high level of public enthusiasm for employing cyberattacks to respond to national security threats (Leal and Musgrave 2023). Voters are enthused by the perceived capacity of cyberattacks as an operationally effective attack option that avoids placing troops in harm's way and which minimizes civilian casualties (Demarest, Jost, and Schub 2024). Even in response to the most egregious and deadly attacks, the public views cyberattacks as being a highly effective and appropriate retaliatory option (Gross, Canetti, and Vashdi 2017; Jardine et al. 2024).\n\nPublic beliefs about cyber power are made salient by the fact that cyber operations are now widely publicized. In the past, cyber operations were famous for taking place under a cloak of anonymity. Yet in recent years, there has been a distinct trend towards public disclosure of cyberattacks wherein authorities willingly publicize what were once secretive cyber operations (Baram 2023; Baram 2022; Poznansky and Perkoski 2018; Egloff and Smeets 2023). Leaders opt to openly divulge cyber operations to signal strength and prestige to external audiences (Egloff and Smeets 2023; Smeets and Lin 2018), to legitimize investments in the cyber domain (Jacobsen and Ringsmose 2017), and to undermine rivals' trust in technology infrastructure (Jacobsen and Ringsmose 2017). This article reinforces an additional rationale for self-attribution, which is signaling strength and resolve to domestic audiences who are galvanized by displays of military force in general, and cyber-force in particular (Shandler et al. 2021).\n\nIt would be understandable at this point for readers to protest that: public perceptions about cyber power are simply incorrect. I agree - public beliefs about cyber power do not necessarily match its constrained reality. Among military officials and cyber experts, the prevailing view holds that cyber power is incapable of independently effecting strategic outcomes, and that it is primarily effective as a force amplifier in coordination with conventional military forces (Valeriano, Jensen, and Maness 2018), or as an act of sub-crisis maneuvering that operates below the threshold of conflict (Maschmeyer 2021; Maschmeyer 2023; Valeriano and Maness 2014;",
    "cf. Demarest, Jost, and Schub 2024). Nevertheless, the disjoint between public perceptions of cyber strength and the reality of its constrained effectiveness is precisely the phenomenon that creates a strategic opportunity for leaders to overcome domestic escalatory pressure.\n\nSpecifically, this paper targets two gaps in the cyber conflict literature that remain understudied. Much of the existing research on cyber power is dedicated to scrutinizing the objective effects and effectiveness of cyber operations. However, it is imperative that we also recognize the impact of (oftentimes distorted) perceptions about cyber power. Beliefs about cyber capabilities, even if untethered from reality, shape behavior and decision-making in real ways. Additionally, the accumulating research on public opinion and cyber power must take a final step to interrogate the strategic impact of public attitudes and beliefs. To date, mounting empirical research has demonstrated that cyberattacks roil public beliefs about international affairs and arouse strong emotional reactions (Shandler and Canetti 2024). The missing step is to connect these public responses to concrete political outcomes to make the case of why public opinion matters. In the next section, we take this leap by interpreting public opinion through the prism of domestic audience costs.\n\n## Interpreting Cyber Operations Through the Lens of Audience Costs\n\nTo briefly revisit the main tenets of audience cost theory, governments manufacture domestic audience costs to credibly communicate resolve to actors in the international arena. By publicly threatening to employ military force, leaders add credibility to their signals, since both parties to the conflict are aware that domestic constituencies punish governments that say one thing and do another (Fearon 1994; Smith 1998; Baum 2004; Slantchev 2006; Weeks 2008). The presence of audience costs transforms public threats from cheap talk into informative signals. According to the basic precepts of this theory, when a rival refuses to accede to a threat underpinned by audience costs, a leader has two principal options: to follow through on the threat and so escalate the conflict, or to back down from the threat and suffer domestic censure.\n\nCyber operations challenge this basic theory. What if there was an option for leaders to publicly issue a threat (an ostensibly costly signal), and yet avoid the imposition of audience costs were they to back down? I argue that cyberattacks can strike this delicate balance. To the domestic audience, wielding cyber power sends a message of strength since the public holds clear (if exaggerated) beliefs about the value and effectiveness of cyber power. Importantly, this domestically targeted message of strength is untethered to the operational effects produced by cyberattacks. As such, even minor cyberattacks with little operational or escalatory impact can placate voters' expectation of “strong” military resolve.",
    "INTERNATIONAL INTERACTIONS\n\n#\n\nIn Figure 1, I visualize an updated crisis bargaining model that newly incorporates cyberattacks as a distinct military option. The figure reimagines the traditional decision tree associated with audience cost theories, with the addition of a new option (D) depicted in blue. The scenario depicts a crisis between two players — who we can think of as a country (1) and a foreign rival (2). The game progresses with the country deciding at the first phase whether to publicly threaten the use of force against the foreign rival in attempt to achieve a strategic objective. If the country refrains from making any threat — then the scenario ends with them having decided to (A) stay out of the crisis. If the country issues a threat, and the foreign rival does not concede, then the onus moves back to the country to decide whether to (B) back down from their threat, or (C) follow through on their threat. Audience cost models are principally\n\nFigure 1. Updated crisis bargaining model with new cyberattack option.\n![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)\nNote: The figure reflects the crisis scenario with expected domestic and strategic payoffs for player 1 presented under each terminal node. Ticks reflect the optimal outcomes, with no audience costs being preferred to the sufferance of audience costs, and de-escalation being preferred to military escalation.

    "concerned with the difference between staying out and backing down, since publics demonstrably punish leaders who renege on their commitments.\n\nUntil now, these first options reflect the typical crisis bargaining model. Each of options (B) and (C) yields a negative consequence. By backing down from a threat, a government can refrain from unwanted military escalation, but will suffer a drop in public approval as their domestic constituents punish them for acting inconsistently and weakly (Kertzer and Brutger 2016). Alternatively, by following through and engaging in military action, a government can avoid domestic denunciation, but must prepare for a military conflagration whose consequences are unknown. We now add an additional avenue of action (D) — which depicts a government decision to conduct a cyberattack.\n\nBased on the above analysis describing how voters perceive cyber power, we can expect that employing a cyberattack allows the government player to mitigate any negative consequences — epitomizing a digital get out jail free card. The evidence suggests that cyber operations conducted in isolation are not a replacement for conventional warfare (Kostyuk and Gartzke 2022), and they are unlikely to engender escalatory consequences (Jensen, Valeriano, and Whitt 2024; Lin-Greenberg 2023; Libicki 2020; Fischerkeller and Harknett 2017). Yet from the perspective of the public, the cyberattack would be viewed as an act of force and a clear expression of intent. Seeing as the public view cyberspace as an effective operational domain, comparable to air and land power, launching a cyberattack meets the initial promise of force and allays any modicum of inconsistency that would give rise to audience costs. The country's leader, in this scenario, has the best of both worlds — they have backed down from a potentially escalatory conflict situation while avoiding domestic political consequences.\n\nAdmittedly, this logical chain of events represents just one scenario in which offensive cyber operations might be used in conflict settings. Nevertheless, this model of crisis bargaining has served to theorize about leader's decision making for decades, and there is value in overlaying cyber operations on a well-formed model of international relations. Our central focus of interest is whether benign cyber operations can effectively send signals of strength to domestic audiences. On this basis, I put forward the following testable hypothesis: cyberattacks, even those with limited operational effects, will be interpreted as a signal of strength and an effective projection of force by domestic audiences.\n\n## Experimental Methodology\n\nTo test the above theoretical framework, I employ a well-trodden pathway for experimentally examining audience costs that relies on original survey",
    "INTERNATIONAL INTERACTIONS\n\n#\n\nexperiments. Since Tomz (2007) first introduced a technique to empirically scrutinize the phenomenon, a series of subsequent experiments have corroborated its veracity and successfully replicated and extended the inherent logic of audience costs (Hoffman et al. 2009; Trager and Vavreck 2011; Levendusky and Horowitz 2012; Davies and Johns 2013; Chaudoin 2014; Kertzer and Brutger 2016; Lin-Greenberg 2019). This experimental approach has proven popular because selection biases mean that audience costs are difficulty to study through observational data. $^{1}$\n\nThe experimental design involved fielding an online survey experiment in March 2021 on a national sample of 960 Americans recruited using the Prolific Survey Panel. The study respondents represented a cross-section of the general population (mean age = 35 years, SD = 12.9). The sample's political orientation leans slightly to the left, with 56% of respondents self-identifying as progressive, while the gender distribution is exactly 50% male and female. Since the purpose of the study is to challenge the conventional logic of audience costs, the structure of the experiment draws heavily from the setup introduced in Tomz's (2007) audience cost study, which has been subject to extensive corroboration and replication. All research design and hypotheses were pre-registered prior to data collection.\n\nTo begin, all respondents were introduced to a scenario according to which \"a foreign country sent its military to take over a territorial region of its neighboring country.\" Respondents were then randomly assigned to one of five treatment conditions (see Table 1) that varied whether or not the U.S. president threatened to intervene and use force, and whether the president followed through on the threat in one way or another. In the stay out condition, which acts as a control group, the president pledges to stay out of the conflict, and indeed refrains from engaging in any conflict. In the other four treatment groups, respondents are told that \"the U.S. president declared that if the attacking country continues to invade, the U.S. military would immediately engage and attempt to push out the\n\n$^{1}$ I acknowledge a resilient school of thought that casts doubt on the empirical validity and theoretical persuasiveness of the phenomenon. One group of critics claim that artificially constructed experimental scenarios lack ecological and external validity since leaders allegedly fail to issue explicit threats, (Snyder and Borghard 2011) or because fictional experiments overstate the costs that respondents impose on real leaders (Croco et al. 2021; Kurizaki and Whang 2015). Another group of critics posit that the absence of real-world crises with corresponding audience cost outcomes calls into question the external validity of this theory (Trachtenberg 2012; Gartzke and Lupu 2012). While conceding the need to carefully construct experimental techniques that mimic real-world scenarios, I suggest that real-world events needn't accord precisely with the phased layout of the experimental structure for us to learn valuable lessons.\n\n$^{2}$ While all online survey panels have a mixed reputation regarding the representativeness of their participant pools, research has shown that the Prolific panel is superior in terms of the comprehension, attention, and honesty of responses compared to other panels (Douglas, Ewell, and Brauer 2023; Eyal et al. 2021).\n\n$^{3}$ The research design was approved by the Research Ethics (IRB) Committee of the authors' institution (approval # 120/21).",

Description of treatment conditions.\n\n|  Treatment condition | N | Presidential threat / declaration | Implemented action  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  Stay out | 190 | The president declared that the U.S. would stay out of the conflict. | The U.S. refrained from engaging in the conflict.  |\n|  Back down | 210 | The president threatened that the U.S. military would engage and push out the attacking country | The U.S. backed down and did not engage the attacking country in any way.  |\n|  Engage militarily (Follow Through) | 175 | The president threatened that the U.S. military would engage and push out the attacking country | Deployed grounds troops against the attacking country  |\n|  Major (degradative) cyberattack | 181 | The president threatened that the U.S. military would engage and push out the attacking country | Major degradative cyberattack that crippled the attacking force's communication networks and rendered its radar system inoperable  |\n|  Minor (disruptive) cyberattack | 204 | The president threatened that the U.S. military would engage and push out the attacking country | Minor disruptive cyberattack that slowed the attacker's digital systems and publicized sensitive personnel files.  |\n\nattacking country.\" In each of these four conditions, the scenario continues with the president either backing down from the threat and abstaining from any military action (back down condition), deploying ground troops against the attacking country (engage militarily condition), employing major degradative cyberattacks that operationally cripple the attacking country's military forces (major cyberattack condition), or employing minor disruptive cyberattacks that cause temporary disruptions to the attacking country's digital systems (minor cyberattack condition). The full survey instruments appear in Online Appendix A, along with balance tables and treatment randomization checks.\n\nConsistent with other iterations of this experimental structure, I control for outcomes by ensuring that all treatment conditions lead to the same endpoint, with the hostile state gaining  $20\\%$  of the contested territory regardless of whether the President engages or stays out (Kertzer and Brutger 2016; Lin-Greenberg 2019). Likewise, seeing as domestic casualties are a central guiding factor in military approval, I control for this by ensuring that the United States experiences zero casualties in any scenario.4\n\nFollowing exposure to one of the conflict conditions, which was reinforced through a series of attention checks, I measured the dependent variable of interest by asking participants whether they approved or disapproved of the way the President handled the situation on a seven-point scale. Additionally, I collected data on respondents' dispositional",
    "INTERNATIONAL INTERACTIONS\n\n#\n\ncharacteristics such as militant assertiveness using a scale developed by Herrmann, Tetlock, and Visser (1999), international trust via a measured produced by Brewer (2004), and political ideology using the standard measure from the American National Election Studies. I further collected a comprehensive battery of demographic characteristics, including gender, employment, age, level of education, and technological literacy. Information on the scales and sources of all collected measures appears in the Online Appendix.\n\n# Results\n\nTo assess how use of force decisions give rise to audience costs, Figure 2 reveals the average treatment effect of each experimental condition on presidential approval. The average treatment effect consists of a regression coefficient estimate for each proxy treatment group when compared to the baseline \"Stay Out\" condition. $^{6}$  For this first analysis, I combine the two cyberattacks treatments into one overarching cyber group to construct a general cyber effect.\n\nA number of results immediately leap out. First, similarly to all audience cost experiments, we can see that the typical audience cost effect (conceptualized as the effect of backing down from a commitment compared to staying out of the conflict) is negative, large, and statistically significant  $(\\beta = -1.622, p &lt; .000)$ . This finding rehashes the central tenet of domestic audience costs, showing that voters will punish a leader for issuing a threat to use force and then backing down. Likewise, we can be encouraged by the fact that the level of support for engaging militarily (and not acting inconsistently) also acts as expected, with no statistically significant difference between military engagement and staying out of the conflict  $(\\beta = .151, p = \\mathrm{n.s.})$ . Essentially, voters are looking for consistency; they will not punish the president for evincing a desire to stay out of the conflict and doing so, nor will they punish the president for making a threat and following through. Only backing down from an explicit threat leads to domestic censure.\n\nWhen turning to our primary variable of interest, the effect of conducting cyberattacks, we can observe a slight but statistically significant increase in presidential approval following a cyberattack, compared to the\n\n6The full regression output appears in Online Appendix E.\n\n7The belligerence cost effect is necessarily smaller than the audience cost effect, since inconsistent behavior makes up the majority of an audience cost (Kertzer and Brutger 2016). The public applies a belligerence cost due to disapproval of aggressive behavior, even if it is consistent with past promises. In the presented results, engaging militarily did not lead to any statistically significant decrease in public approval. This is consistent with past findings by Lin-Greenberg (2019) and Croco, Hanmer, and McDonald (2021), and contrasts with Kertzer and Brutger (2016) who identified a slight but statistically significant belligerence cost.",

Situational approval by experimental condition.\n![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)\nNote: This plot depicts estimates of the treatment effect of each experimental condition on presidential approval relative to the stay out condition.

Bars represent  $95\\%$  confidence intervals and dots depict estimate means.\n\nbaseline stay out condition ( $\\beta = .360$ ,  $p &lt; .019$ ). According to our conceptualization of this treatment, cyberattacks constitute a repudiation of the initial promise, almost akin to backing down. The president had declared that the U.S. military would actively engage and push out the attacking country's forces. Yet far from actualizing this commitment, the president contented with a single barrage of cyberattacks against the attacking country's forces that merely publicized sensitive information or targeted its radar systems. Neither action represents a level of military engagement sufficient to \"push back the attacking forces,\" and the rival country would certainly view such an attack as a token and de-escalatory signal. Yet even though this path of action represents the kind of inconsistency that should evoke domestic disapproval — as with the back down condition — the public actually reports a slight increase in approval. As theorized, it appears that that a leader can back down from a threat without suffering domestic",
    "censure simply by deploying militarily trivial cyber operations that appear forceful to domestic constituents.\n\nA fact that adds credibility to this reading of the results is the fact that the public keenly distinguishes between greater and lesser military action. Lin-Greenberg (2019) found that leaders who committed to full military action can partially mitigate audience costs by deploying lesser attack techniques such as air-strikes or sanctions. Lin-Greenberg's alternative attack options fell somewhere in between realizing the full-throated military threat and completely backing down — and the public was able to discern this important distinction leading to lowered but not entirely mitigated audience costs. Yet in the case of cyberattacks, we don't see merely reduced audience costs, we see an actual increase in approval ratings. The study respondents viewed the cyberattack as a kept promise, even though its effectiveness is objectively limited. This accords with research by Shandler, Gross, and Canetti (2021) who revealed a strong public enthusiasm for cyber warfare on the basis of its being perceived as an operationally effective military option that minimizes friendly and collateral deaths.\n\n### Breaking Down Cyberattacks—Degradative Versus Disruptive Strikes\n\nTo add additional nuance to the analyses, and to avoid the critique of earlier audience cost experiments that oversimplified the choices available to leaders, I break down cyberattacks into degradative (major) cyberattacks and disruptive (minor) cyberattacks. Disruptive cyber techniques differ from degradative attacks in the permanence, the destructiveness, and the operational effectiveness of the attack. We could expect that the rarer, and more degradative cyberattacks are far likelier to be construed by the public as meeting the leader's initial promise of “military engagement that pushes back the attackers' forces.” Disruptive cyberattacks, by contrast, should not even come close to meeting this promise and should be viewed as wholly equivalent to backing down.\n\nIn Figure 3, I again illustrate the average treatment effect for each experimental condition, though this time dividing the previously uniform cyberattacks into degradative and disruptive cyberattacks. Furthermore, I add an interaction effect to account for the respondents' level of technological literacy. This heterogeneous factor is crucial for the subsequent analysis since research has consistently shown that people's level of digital sophistication guides their perceptions of the efficacy of cyber threats and operations (Kostyuk & Wayne 2021; Gomez and Villar 2018).",
    "#\n\nR. SHANDLER\n\nFigure 3. Situational approval by experimental condition—conditional on technological literacy.\n![img-2.jpeg](img-2.jpeg)\nNote: This plot depicts estimates of the treatment effect of each experimental condition on presidential approval relative to the stay out condition. Estimates are based on an OLS model with interaction effects between tech literacy and each proxy experimental condition. Bars represent  $95\\%$  confidence intervals and dots depict estimate means.\n\nFigure 3 reveals that no audience costs are levied for either degradative or disruptive attacks. In essence, the public perceives even minor cyberattacks that have no lasting operational benefits as meeting the commitment of leaders to \"push back an attacker.\" Critically, we can see that the wide-ranging approval of cyberattacks is not contingent on technological literacy. One would think that high-tech literacy respondents would be more aware of the limited effects produced by cyber operations and that this group would recognize that minor, disruptive cyber operations do not meet the promise of a strong military response — but even high-tech literacy respondents refrained from imposing audience costs on leaders who deployed cyberattacks in lieu of conventional force. Both technologically literate and illiterate respondents refrain from punishing a leader for employing cyber operations, granting presidential flexibility across the board.",
    "Heterogeneous Effects: Hawks and Doves\n\nAs a third analysis, I examine whether the cyber pathway of avoiding audience costs holds when viewed through the lens of political orientation. I take this step since studies have identified that the strength of audience costs is highly conditional upon political orientation (Kertzer and Brutger 2016). Kertzer and Brutger (2016) even found that hawks and doves apply audience costs for different reasons — with hawks primarily punishing inconsistency and doves punishing belligerence along with inconsistency.\n\nIn Figure 4, I once again illustrate the average treatment effect for each experimental condition, including an interaction effect to account for political orientation. Since we are dealing with foreign policy views, I use militant assertiveness to distinguish between hawkishness and dovishness, a measure that tests beliefs about the desirability and effectiveness of the use of force in foreign policy. This three-item scale, developed by Herrmann, Tetlock, and Visser (1999), is commonly used in experimental studies that focus on foreign policy attitudes rather than purely domestic political attitudes.\n\nThe results reveal that when it comes to backing down and engaging militarily, the participants act as expected. Doves apply a substantial audience cost that is made up of an inconsistency cost (49%) that censures the perceived inconsistency of the president's actions, and a belligerence cost (51%) that punishes the threats of force. Hawks, by contrast, apply a larger audience cost than doves, and this cost is made up entirely by the overwhelming aversion to the perceived inconsistency of the president's behavior (> 100%). Both hawks and doves impose audience costs, just for different reasons.\n\nBut how do these groups look upon the exercise of cyberattacks? Looking at Figure 4, we can see that both groups refrain from imposing any audience costs when leaders execute disruptive or degradative cyberattacks that depart from their initial promises. It appears that the use of cyberattacks moderates the extremities of the partisan divide over conducting military action. Looking at the “engage militarily” column, we can see that hawks reward leaders who engage in military action in accordance with their commitments, while doves punish leaders for their belligerence. Yet these extremes are visibly softened for both types of cyberattacks. Doves view the use of cyberattacks as less severe than conventional military engagements, and so the belligerence cost and the inconsistency cost disappear. Meanwhile, hawks are slightly less enamored of cyberattacks compared to conventional military attacks, but still find them to be sufficiently forceful to meet the initial promise and so avoid any semblance of inconsistency. Though there remain differences between these groups, cyberattacks demonstrate enormous promise in striking a middle ground that can assuage even the highly partisan perceptions of hawks and doves towards the use of force in conflict settings.",

Estimates are based on an OLS model with interaction effects between tech literacy and each proxy experimental condition. Bars represent  $95\\%$  confidence intervals and dots depict estimate means.\n\n# Robustness Tests\n\nResearchers have critiqued the use of hypothetical presidential figures in international relations experiments on the basis that presidential evaluations are largely driven by partisan cues that are absent in fictitious vignettes (Croco et al. 2021). To test the robustness of the current results in face of this critique, the survey participants were asked, as the experiment continued, to view updated conflict scenarios that depicted President Biden and Iran as the relevant actors. The alternate dependent variables in this case asked about the level of approval of President Biden's handling of the situation and measured the named President's job approval. I analyze this alternative experimental structure in Online Appendix C, finding that the same results recur under both hypothetical and realistic character representations. The study findings are also robust when excluding participants who failed any of the attention checks that were administered following the experimental treatments.",
    "Discussion\n\nThis article proposes that the emergence of cyber capabilities has altered the nature of domestic audience costs. By taking advantage of voters' captivation with cyber power, and their understandable if erroneous belief in the operational effectiveness of cyber capabilities, leaders can back down from international threats while still appearing strong in the eyes of domestic constituents. I verify this theory through a novel experimental design, which confirms that the public views even minor cyberattacks — an objective signal of restraint — as sufficiently forceful to meet a leader's threat of force and avoid any semblance of inconsistency.\n\nEven with a well-founded theory backed up by robust experimental evidence, we must be careful when generalizing controlled experimental results to real-world events. Voters don't evaluate presidential performance in the artificial environment of survey experiments, and military conflict rarely abides by such clearly delineated phases of threats and responses as laid out in simplified experimental scenarios (Gartzke and Lupu 2012). Therefore, it behooves us to look for real-world examples of cyber audience costs that can corroborate the theory. Even if we cannot isolate specific causal mechanisms when examining historical events, it would be highly suggestive were we to find corroborating examples where minor cyberattacks were advertised as demonstrations of strength to domestic audiences, even while they were objectively used to walk back threats of escalation. I offer two cases where this behavior can be partly observed.\n\nA first real-world example occurred on June 20, 2019, when Iran shot down a U.S. R1-4 Global Hawk UAV (Newman 2019). President Trump immediately and publicly threatened massive retaliatory military strikes against targets inside Iran, claiming that Iran faced “obliteration” for their acts. The threat was ignored by Iranian authorities who insisted that they would continue to shoot down any U.S. assets that entered Iranian airspace (Pickrell 2019). Yet even after publicly issuing a threat, President Trump backed down from the initial threat, sufficing with a series of cyberattacks that disabled Iran's ability to track ships in the region and compromised Iran's missile defense systems (Valeriano and Jensen 2022).\n\nFrom every possible angle, it is indisputable that President Trump walked back his initial threat, setting in place the precise conditions that should give rise to critical domestic censure and generate inconsistency costs. In lieu of the promised “obliteration,” the American response de-escalated the situation by conducting a relatively minor cyberattack that signaled restraint. The cyberattack was effectively used as an off-ramp to avoid a dangerous escalation of hostilities (Valeriano and Jensen 2022), and indeed this cycle of hostilities came to an end.",
    "Yet to the domestic public, the restrained cyberattack was not viewed as a capitulation. Even though the attack objectively failed to meet the severity of the initial promise to “obliterate” Iran, the cyberattack was still viewed as a signal of strength and resolve. Comparing polls taken immediately prior and following the incident, President Trump suffered no situational disapproval or lowered confidence in voters' perceptions of his ability to handle the situation in Iran (Pew Research Center 2019). In fact, the Trump administration may have exploited the secrecy that is inherently connected with cyber operations to inflate voters' beliefs about the attack's impact (Baram 2023, 2022). By emphasizing the covertness of the attack and the ambiguity associated with the effects, media coverage of the incident likely inflated public perceptions about the severity of the muted cyberattack.\n\nA similar scenario played out in Israel one year later. During April 2020, Iranian hackers infiltrated the systems of an Israeli water plant (Times of Israel 2020). The hackers sought to cripple computer systems that controlled water flow and raise the level of chlorine within the water mix that was distributed to Israeli homes. The incident was thwarted before it could cause major damage, though it sent shivers down the country's spine. Israeli citizens were baying for blood, and Israeli leadership declared that the targeting of civilian infrastructure was a “red line” that warranted swift, decisive, and massive retaliation.\n\nYet massive retaliation did not arrive. Instead, Israel conducted a rather innocuous cyber operation targeting Iran's Shahid Rajaee port, causing a temporary traffic jam among commercial shipping vehicles (Warrick and Nakashima 2020). To the Iranians and to the international community who were working to avoid any military escalation, the limited Israeli cyberattack marked an end to fears of impending war. Yet to Israeli civilians, the cyberattack was trumpeted as a remarkable sign of Israeli cyber prowess and a blow to the Iranian regime (Baram 2023). Once again, a country's leadership could have their cake and eat it too, appearing strong to domestic audiences while backing down from military escalation.\n\nZooming out, this study bears implications on three different aspects of conflict — the escalatory properties of cyber power, the efficacy of conflict signaling in the cyber age, and the role of public opinion in foreign affairs. First, regarding the debate over the escalatory dynamics of cyber operations, we can now add a small weight on the de-escalatory side of the scale. It was once thought that public exposure to frightening cyberattacks would cause mass demands for retaliation, generating",
    "escalatory pressure on leaders who must be responsive to public sentiment (Shandler, Gross, and Canetti 2022). Yet this idea has been refuted (Kreps and Schneider 2019), and the evidence now suggests that public opinion adds de-escalatory pressures to cyber operations, granting leaders the ability to act with restraint without worrying about militant domestic blowback.\n\nSecond, what does this finding mean for the future of conflict signaling? Credibility lies at the core of international relations, and leaders have developed sophisticated methods to send signals that overcome a built-in credibility deficit — the most famous of which are costly signaling. Yet according to this paper, rivals can no longer trust purportedly costly tied-hands signals if they know that the signaling leaders possess a path of action that allows them to avoid the imposition of audience costs - even if they back down from their threat. Absent any compensatory mechanisms, the reduced effectiveness of costly signaling will insert significant uncertainty into crisis bargaining and increase skepticism about the authenticity of military threats.\n\nOne option to salvage this popular form of signaling may be to issue more specific and severe threats. As a rule, leaders prefer to keep their options open by issuing general threats (Quek and Johnston 2018; Snyder and Borghard 2011). Yet the advent of cyber circumvention strategies may require that future threats become more specific in order to maintain their previous levels of credibility. For officials seeking to impose audience costs, they may now be required to declare that the United States Army will send ground forces from a particular unit to secure a site, or that the U.S. Air Force will launch specific missiles if a rival doesn't back down, since only highly specific guarantees can ensure that a cyber-attack will be perceived as inconsistent with the threats. Alternatively, leaders may be forced to rely on alternative signaling techniques, reweighing the form and balance of their signaling communications. While tied-hands signals are commonly conceived as being the most effective method of conveying intentions (Fearon 1997), leaders possess an arsenal of other techniques at their disposal that may now become more popular (Quek 2021).\n\nLast, regarding public opinion, we gain yet another piece of evidence attesting to the consequentiality of public opinion toward cyber operations. It is easy to dismiss the relevance of public opinion when it comes to international relations. Intricate dynamics of international conflict tend to take place above the heads of regular voters, who have historically deferred to elites in such matters (Berinsky 2009). Yet research consistently shows that public opinion can have a small yet meaningful effect on conflict decision-making (Sevenans 2021; Lin-Greenberg 2021; Tomz and Weeks 2020). This is especially the case when it comes to cyber power, and leaders must be attuned to public attitudes. We already know that public",
    "exposure to incoming cyberattacks can manifest major political consequences (Shandler, Gross, and Canetti 2023), and now we see that the reverse is true as well — that public enthusiasm for outgoing cyber operations can generate new conflict dynamics. It is a lessen well worth learning that public opinion matters in cyber conflict.\n\nI end by noting several research limitations that deserve attention. Most conspicuously, the phases of the experimental game — wherein a leader issues a threat, awaits a response, and then decides how to react — is but one of many possible scenarios in which cyber operations might be deployed. This echoes a frequent critique that audience cost experiments lack ecological validity (Snyder and Borghard 2011). While conceding that future research should examine the veracity of the findings under different scenarios, the core finding — that domestic audiences view cyberattacks as a demonstration of forceful leadership — is not reliant on the particular circumstances of this or any other study's experimental setup. The present study would also benefit from complementary research into how elites and foreign states view cyber operations. The ability of leaders to de-escalate conflict while still appearing strong in the eyes of domestic constituents is reliant on the fact that foreign actors will indeed view cyber operations as an act of restraint. To date, this second half of the equation is surmised on the basis of extensive observational and experimental studies that have accumulated in the literature (Jensen, Valeriano, and Whitt 2024; Lin-Greenberg 2023; Kostyuk and Gartzke 2022; Maschmeyer and Dunn Cavelty 2022; Gomez and Whyte 2020). Corroborating this component with robust experimental data would provide a fuller picture showing how different stakeholders perceived cyber capabilities, and how these perceptions are strategically consequential.\n\nI gratefully acknowledge the valuable feedback offered by colleagues and friends, among them: Daphna Canetti, Andres Gannon, Miguel Gomez, Erik Lin-Greenberg, Michael Gross, Nadiya Kostyuk, Harry Oppenheimer, Jordan Tama, Brandon Valeriano, and Christopher Whyte.

    "abstract": "Cyber power is altering the nature of domestic audience costs. By exploiting voters' captivation with cyber conflict, leaders can now de-escalate crises without having to worry about suffering domestic censure. Such is the allure of cyber power among the mass public that even minor cyberattacks with little operational impact can placate voters' expectation of strong military force. In practice, this means that leaders who would otherwise be bound by domestic audience costs can \"escape\" by conducting disruptive cyberattacks that merely appear forceful to domestic constituents. To explore how cyber operations temper domestic escalatory pressures, I conduct a survey experiment that asks participants to evaluate presidential leadership following the deployment of cyber or conventional force. The findings confirm that the public view cyberattacks — even ephemeral, inconsequential cyberattacks — as sufficiently forceful to meet a leader's threat of force and placate their zeal for military action. Offering examples of how this theory has played out in multiple real-world incidents, I demonstrate how public enthusiasm for cyber power adds newfound flexibility to crisis decision-making.",
