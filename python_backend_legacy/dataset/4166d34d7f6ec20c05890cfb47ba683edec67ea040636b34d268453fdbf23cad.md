  "full_text": "# CRACKING ATTRIBUTION: MOVING INTERNATIONAL NORMS FORWARD\nJoshua Lefebvre\nThis Note addresses how international law can meet the challenge of reliably and transparently identifying the actor responsible for a cyber attack, a feature of the cyber landscape referred to as the “attribution problem.” It examines the potential for customary international law to define evidentiary standards for evaluating claims of a cyber attacker’s identity, standards which would have to be met before a state victim could retaliate. Such a framework would replace the malleable and opaque ad hoc determinations of responsibility that states currently undertake in both the conventional force and the cyber contexts alike. To this end, this Note introduces a sliding-scale evidentiary standard that adapts to the—often limited—availability of evidence and short amount of time a victim might have to respond to cyber attacks.\nThis Note analogizes to attribution problems faced by the international community in the past, such as piracy and privateering on the eighteenth century’s high seas, to demonstrate that the legal problems posed by cyber capabilities are not unfamiliar. But the ubiquity of cyber capabilities and diffuse nature of the cyber landscape mean that the solution must be different. This Note demonstrates that a newly proposed non-governmental attribution body, structured like a tribunal, could meet the tremendous need many victims face in gathering the evidence to overcome the attribution problem inherent to cyberspace. Such a body, this Note argues, provides the best launchpad for developing the international norms—and, eventually, the customary international law—needed to build evidentiary standards in the cyber context.\nINTRODUCTION ... 1\nI.

Treaties dealing directly with cyber operations are scarce in number and limited in scope.¹ State cyber practices are held close to the chest and, although their publicly available expressions are increasing, there are still too few to constitute well-defined norms to develop comprehensive customary international law.² While it at least seems clear today that existing principles of international law apply in cyberspace,³ states—perhaps as a result of their own strategic caution⁴—have, at present, left to the academy and non-governmental bodies much of the task of determining how such principles apply.⁵ Against this hazy legal backdrop, states and non-state actors alike have wasted no time in deploying cyber attacks and exploitations of ever more destructive and exploitative power. In June 2017, according to the U.S. government, the Russian military launched “the most destructive and costly cyber attack in history,” using ransomware dubbed “NotPetya” to cause billions of dollars in damage across Europe, the Americas, and Asia.⁶ Just two months later, in August 2017, a petrochemical plant in Saudi Arabia suffered a cyber attack that was designed to trigger an explosion that likely\n¹ Introduction to International Governmental Group of Experts, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations 3 (Michael N.

Namely, the application of state responsibility principles¹⁰ remains difficult—if not impossible—where victims cannot reliably and transparently identify the actor responsible or, worse, if the attacker’s identity remains unknown.

Charter and core principles of customary international law, such as state sovereignty and non-intervention.¹¹\nThis Note begins in Part I by defining the attribution problem and identifying the factual challenges it poses for dealing with offensive cyber operations. It then explores the evidentiary framework by which attribution claims in both the conventional and cyber context are measured. In doing so, it attempts to identify and help fill the gap in the academic literature surrounding what standards of proof are and should be expected to be met under international law. Toward this end, it introduces a novel application of a sliding scale of proof, one tied to the severity of the victim’s response rather than solely to the underlying breach of international law. Part I then concludes by providing a brief overview of how principles of state responsibility apply in cyberspace.\nPart II identifies a number of the proposed solutions to the attribution problem suggested in the literature—such as intergovernmental inspection and compliance bodies as well as multilateral treaties—and explains why they are inadequate in the cyber context or are unlikely to come about. It then critiques and builds upon the solution highlighted by this Note: a non-governmental global consortium of representatives from private companies, academia, and think tanks that assesses available forensic evidence to provide an attributional assessment for victims of cyber attack or exploitation.¹² But the value of this organization does not just lie in its ability to provide a much-needed leader for neutral and capable technical investigations. Rather, it has significant potential to lay the groundwork for the proposed sliding-scale evidentiary framework’s\n¹¹ See Waxman, supra note 4, at 426.\n¹² While this Note recognizes the benefits of solutions that propose an intergovernmental organization to govern cyber capability use and compliance, akin to the International Atomic Energy Agency (“IAEA”), see, e.g., Scott Charney et al., Microsoft Corp., From Articulation to Implementation: Enabling Progress on Cybersecurity Norms 11 (2016), it also recognizes that states are highly unlikely in today’s toxic geopolitical environment to agree to allow representatives from foreign governments to inspect some of their most closely held secrets. Further, significant doubts might arise as to the neutrality of governmental representatives serving in the body’s management and operational roles, risking the legitimacy and independence of the body’s assessments.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202\nLefebvre\nCracking Attribution\n4\nadoption into customary international law. And perhaps just as significant, the quality of the organization's attributional assessments carry great promise for their potential to shape state practice toward an expectation of higher quality attributional claims against other states.\nRather than have states judge for themselves how much proof is necessary to respond to an attack,¹³ this Note argues that states might feel obligated to justify their actions in the face of a quantifiable confidence metric, one that could be provided by the proposed non-governmental attribution body. Through reference to the attributional assessment of a neutral and sophisticated body, a state's self-defense¹⁴ and countermeasure¹⁵ activities could rest on a firmer and more transparent evidentiary foundation. In this way, this Note makes the novel suggestion that this non-governmental organization could serve as the best launchpad for developing customary international law to build evidentiary standards in the cyber context.\n## I. DEFINING THE ATTRIBUTION PROBLEM AND ITS SCOPE\nThe attribution problem is often viewed as a technical challenge with a technical solution: the tools of offensive cyber operations make it easy to hide one's identity from a victim, so would-be victims need to build cyber defensive capabilities and cyber forensic investigative capabilities to overcome this challenge. But the limitations of cyber defensive and investigative capabilities can and do pose obstacles to the application of international law. Principally, they foreground the question of how a state could respond lawfully under international law if it does not know against whom it should respond. The immensity of this problem, however, overshadows the subsequent\n¹³ See infra note 78 and accompanying text.\n¹⁴ This Note keys the term “self-defense” to its meaning under Article 51 of the U.N. Charter, limiting it to a victim state’s uses of force taken against an aggressor state in response to an armed attack. U.N. Charter, art. 51.\n¹⁵ In this Note, the term “countermeasures” is used as a term of art. It refers to actions taken by a victim state that amount to a breach of its international obligations vis-à-vis an aggressor state. Such actions must be taken with the goal of bringing the aggressor state back into compliance with its international obligations vis-à-vis the victim state and cannot exceed what is necessary and proportionate to effectuate that goal. Without the preceding act of aggression, these actions would otherwise be considered unlawful. Int’l. L. Comm’n, Rep. on the Work of its Fifty-Third Session, U.N. Doc. A/56/10, at 128–31 (2001).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202\nLefebvre\nCracking Attribution\n5\nobstacle for the international community: the lack of evidentiary standards under international law to evaluate these claims. Together, international law’s lack of evidentiary standards for evaluating a victim’s identification of an attacker and the limited availability of evidence to meet such standards compound the challenges cyber capabilities pose, severely hampering international law’s application and development in cyberspace.¹⁶\nThis Part addresses both of these obstacles. It demonstrates why reliable, standardized, and transparent determinations of a cyber attacker’s identity—referred to throughout this Note as “attributional assessments” or “attributional claims”—are necessary to the successful application of international law’s principles to cyberspace, and it evaluates how customary international law could be developed to meet this end. Toward this effort, Section I.C addresses a relative gap in the literature by assessing what standard of proof is and should be necessary when making an attributional claim.\nFor the purposes of this Note, “attribution” is tied to identity, rather than an action’s particular cause. In this context, attribution refers to the process of determining the “identity or location of an attacker or an attacker’s intermediary.”¹⁷ To qualify as an interstate attributional claim, the identity of the attack or exploitation’s independent operators must be connected with customary international law’s principles of state responsibility, largely reflected in the second Tallinn Manual and discussed in Section I.D.¹⁸ Ultimately, once the technical assessment of the\n¹⁶ Waxman, supra note 4, at 426 (“[T]he low visibility of states’ moves and countermoves in cyberspace will slow the process of interpretive development . . . . Article 2(4) will probably be a weak constraint on offensive cyber-attacks because of, among other reasons, the difficulty of observing them and attributing them to their sources or sponsors . . . . Those weaknesses will . . . likely plague any attempt to negotiate and enforce new international agreements limiting cyber-warfare.”).\n¹⁷ David D.

This Note distinguishes a cyber attack from a cyber exploitation by defining the former as operations that “target one of several attributes of systems or networks and seeks to cause a loss of integrity, a loss of authenticity, or a loss of availability, which includes theft of services.”²⁰ The term “cyber exploitation” is used to refer to operations that target only the “confidentiality of information stored on or passing through a system or network.”²¹ The two terms are collectively referred to as “offensive cyber operations” throughout the piece.\nWhile attribution of cyber attacks and exploitations presents problems for domestic criminal law enforcement and international law alike, this Part, and indeed this Note, will focus primarily on the attribution problem as it relates to international law. Setting aside the technical difficulties of attribution, domestic criminal law—at least in the United States—already supplies procedural mechanisms for assessing the evidence that underlies attributional claims, such as in camera review of classified intelligence.²² Such procedural mechanisms do not transfer well to the\nthe International Law Commission’s (“ILC”) Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (“Articles on State Responsibility”) endorsed in the U.N. General Assembly Resolution on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts. G.A. Res. 56/83 (Jan. 28, 2002).

Conventional Parallels\nThe difficulty in linking attacks to the identity of the attacker is not a new problem for international law: states have struggled with making such determinations for centuries. This is true where another state has been the attacker, where a non-state actor acting under its own direction has been the attacker, and where state proxies acting under the direction of a sponsoring state have been the source of the attacks. Some commentators have drawn parallels between today’s challenges in policing cyberspace to those created by the state use of privateers on the high seas in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.²⁴ Florian Egloff notes how both the high seas through that period and cyberspace involve a range of actors, each with varying degrees of direction and control from a sponsoring state.²⁵ Between these two different eras and environments, the parallels between state actors, semi-state actors, and non-state actors can be readily drawn: respectively, consider the similarities between formal navies and cyber military units, privateers and today’s “patriotic hackers,”²⁶ or even pirates and most modern cybercriminals or cybercrime organizations.²⁷\n²³ See infra note 66.\n²⁴ Florian Egloff, Cybersecurity and the Age of Privateering, in Understanding Cyber Conflict: 14 Analogies 231, (George Perkovich &amp; Ariel E. Levite eds., 2017); Noah Schachtman &amp; Peter W.

In large part, it is not unlike that provided to modern states by “patriotic hackers” or other non-state actors in cyberspace who act with impunity in a harboring state, if not the state’s explicit sponsorship.²⁹ To deal with the difficulties arising out of this ambiguity, state practice led to expectations—and, eventually, customary international law—that privateers would post their true flags before firing a shot from across the bow in order to seize another ship for search, despite allowing false flags to be flown while chasing a vessel.³⁰ While this helped to mitigate the attribution difficulties that arose, they were not entirely resolved until privateering fell out of use after it was abolished by multilateral treaty in 1856.³¹\nMore modern comparisons are often drawn to the Cold War, where attribution and causality issues frequently arose in the context of Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter’s prohibition on the use of force.³² This came about in large part from the transition from conventional war-making to “unconventional [and] low-intensity conflict [that] featured inconclusive evidence of foreign involvement or hostile action, and foreign state antagonists [who] worked to mask, conceal, or obscure their participation and responses.”³³ As with today’s cyber attacks and exploitations, “once\n²⁸ Carl J.

While technical attribution capabilities are increasing for many states, including the United States, the identification of the machine or machines used in carrying out the attack, their operators, or even the geographic locations of the machines and their operators is not always enough when making a determination of state responsibility.³⁶ Yet the stakes are high. If the injured state responds to a wrongful act under international law³⁷ with a countermeasure aimed at a wrongly accused state, then the injured state has then committed an internationally wrongful act by engaging in countermeasures against an innocent state.³⁸ Simply put, the international legal framework currently in place for responding to uses of force, armed attacks, and other breaches of international obligations cannot function properly without reliable attributional assessments, regardless of whether the unlawful action occurs in the context of a cyber or a traditional physical operation.³⁹\n³⁴ Id.\n³⁵ See Banks, supra note 2, at 1493 (describing some of the technical challenges posed by cyber attacks and exploitations).\n³⁶ Banks, supra note 2, at 1502.

The Factual Challenge of Attribution\nAttribution of interstate cyber operations—like operations in the conventional kinetic context—can be broken down into two components: (1) the identity of the individual operators who carried out the operation; and (2) the relationship those operators have, if any, to any given state.⁴⁰ These two components comprise factual inquiries, of course, into what machines were used to carry out an attack, who operated them, and who directed or controlled those operators for purposes of the operation.\nAt the most basic level, an offensive cyber operation involves one or more individuals, often acting remotely, who interfaces with one or more computers or entire networks—usually by means of programming code—in order to gain access to the targeted systems through hardware or software security vulnerabilities or through fraudulent credentials. Once the operation’s conductors have gained access to the desired system, they attempt to take advantage of the system to plant code, known as malware,⁴¹ that will destroy or degrade the intruded system, exfiltrate information from the system, or both.⁴²\nCyber operations pose significant and unique challenges in the evidentiary context as it relates to both the identity of the operator and attribution to a state. This is in part because the operations are “opaque to public view, technically very complex and likely to emerge piecemeal,” unlike conventional kinetic attacks, which are visible and “can be and often are broadcast widely, immediately, and understandably [and, further, the] common experience [of such attacks] makes\n⁴⁰ See Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua (Nicar. v.

In the latter case, the Court has had to endeavour first to establish what actually happened, before entering on the next stage of considering whether the act (if proven) was imputable to the State to which it has been attributed.”); Yeager v.

Once the work of these operators has been compiled into these groups, their errors and the evidence of their identity begin to stack up across operations and malware toolkits, leading forensic investigators to more easily identify them.⁵⁹ Lastly, the identity of targets themselves might provide clues as to whom the attacker might be, since victim-targeting patterns might assist forensic analysts in building a more accurate attacker profile.⁶⁰\nBut intermediate-to-advanced cyber actors do not proceed unaware of these investigative tactics. Sophisticated operators, while not immune to making mistakes that could help reveal their true identity, are familiar with attribution methods used at private cybersecurity firms and state intelligence agencies, and many of them make good use of their knowledge. Offensive cyber operators of this sophistication level often create “ghost leads” by leaving behind intentional errors that point in the direction of different actors who had no role in the attack or exploitation.⁶¹ These\n⁵⁶ Bartholomew &amp; Guerrero-Saade, Kaspersky Lab, USA, supra note 44, at 1–2; see Scott J.

HUMINT includes sources such as interviews with recruited foreign agents. Despite the private sector's incredible technical forensics capabilities—which can rival that of states in terms of its technical capacity to identify offensive cyber operators—some of these more traditional sources of intelligence are unavailable to even the most sophisticated cybersecurity firms.⁶⁵ While Symantec, Kaspersky, FireEye, CrowdStrike, and others may have an incredible talent pool and significant financial resources, they do not \"control the wires\" nor can they deploy on-the-ground espionage operations to develop critical intelligence to help implicate responsible states or better ascertain the identities of operators.\nBut even those states that are able to meet the factual challenge of identifying an attacker with a high degree of confidence are often unwilling to release much of the evidence on which\n⁶² See supra notes 49–55 and accompanying text (discussing the offensive cyber operation against TV5Monde).\n⁶³ See Cyber Warfare in the 21st Century: Threats, Challenges, and Opportunities: Hearing Before the H.

What are the legal obligations of states to publicly disclose the evidence on which the attribution claim has been made? And what degree of control over the individual operators is necessary to hold a state responsible? The first two relate to evidentiary standards for evaluating how much evidence a state must show and who, if any party, must bring forward that evidence. The third question relates to principles of state responsibility under international law.\n## C. Locating Evidentiary Standards for State Breaches of International Obligations\nDespite the need to develop some sort of factual basis for the claim that one state has breached its international obligations to another,⁶⁷ there is no unified international law of evidence that governs what evidence should make up that factual basis or what that factual basis needs to prove.⁶⁸ This is true in both the conventional context and in cyberspace. The issue has been made plain most recently in the 2018 Salisbury chemical attack, in which the United Kingdom accused the Russian Federation of attempting to assassinate, on British soil, former Russian military intelligence officer and British spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia Skripal with a Novichok nerve agent.⁶⁹ The United Kingdom declared that it would find Russia to have breached its\n⁶⁶ See, e.g., Ellen Nakashima, U.S. Decides Against Publicly Blaming China for Data Hack, Wash.

In April 2018, the country released a letter from Sir Mark Sedwill, the United Kingdom’s National Security Advisor, to the Secretary General of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, indicating that the Russian government was testing Novichok agents on door handles.75\n70 Ellen Barry &amp; Richard Pérez-Peña, Britain Blames Moscow for Poisoning of Former Russian Spy, N.Y.

But given its willingness to provide some evidence publicly and share significant amounts of intelligence with allies, one might suppose that this burden is not insubstantial. Despite the difference between cyber operations and chemical attacks—which, particularly due to the sheer complexity of handling chemical agents like Novichoks, carry less plausible deniability than an actor would have in an offensive cyber operation—the evidentiary problems in the international arena are strikingly similar.\n1. Is There an Attribution Standard for Cyberspace Under International Law?\nIn the cyber context, the answers to the evidentiary questions are even more underdeveloped due to the paucity of transparent state practice and *opinio juris*—a term that refers to a state’s sense of legal obligation—in making public attributional statements for offensive cyber operations.⁷⁶ In its 2015 report, the U.N. Group of Governmental Experts acknowledged that attribution claims for cyber operations “should be substantiated.” But the report failed to articulate how much or what type of evidence is necessary for states to justify countermeasures or acts of self-defense under international law, or even whether such claims must be substantiated publicly.⁷⁷ The United States has gone one step further in articulating its position on the matter in remarks made in November 2016 by then-U.S. Department of State Legal Adviser Brian Egan:\n⁷⁶ See Tallinn Manual 2.0, supra note 1, at 83. In order to establish customary international law, there must be a history of state practice driven by a sense of legal obligation, referred to as *opinion juris*.\n⁷⁷ Rep. of the Group of Governmental Experts on Devs. in the Field of Info. and Telecomms. in the Context of Int’l Security, transmitted by Letter Dated 26 June 2015 from Deborah Stokes (Chair of the Group), U.N.

A/70/174 at 13 (July 22, 2015) (“[T]he indication that an ICT activity was launched or otherwise originates from the territory or the ICT infrastructure of a State may be insufficient in itself to attribute the activity to that State. The Group noted that the accusations of organizing and implementing wrongful acts brought against States should be substantiated.”).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202\nLefebvre\nCracking Attribution\n18\nThe law of state responsibility does not set forth explicit burdens or standards of proof for making a determination about legal attribution. In this context, a State acts as its own judge of the facts and may make a unilateral determination with respect to attribution of a cyber operation to another State. Absolute certainty is not—and cannot be—required. Instead, international law generally requires that States act reasonably under the circumstances when they gather information and draw conclusions based on that information.78\nThe IGE understands this “reasonableness” standard as involving an examination of whether states have considered, among other factors, the reliability, quantum, directness, nature, and specificity of the relevant information available to the injured state in light of attendant circumstances and the importance of the right involved.79 While these factors are fairly malleable, the method is not dissimilar from the “ad hoc” way in which states evaluate factual claims in the conventional force context.80\nAs to whether the reasonableness standard includes the obligation to publicly disclose the evidence on which an attribution claim has been made, the IGE was of the opinion that there is not enough state practice or *opinio juris* to evidence such a requirement under customary international law.81 This insufficiency is, in large part, a result of the highly classified nature of cyber capabilities, whether used offensively, defensively, or as part of a forensic investigation.82 Conceivably, this could change as more forensic analysis of cyber operations is conducted by\n78 Brian J. Egan, Remarks on International Law and Stability in Cyberspace at Berkeley Law School (Nov. 10, 2016), https://www.law.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/egan-talk-transcript-111016.pdf. It is worth noting that Egan’s statement may be a step forward, but it does not amount to much. No state could possibly expect absolute certainty given the difficulties surrounding attribution of offensive cyber operations. By settling on a requirement of “reasonableness,” the statement begs the question it is trying to answer, since such “reasonableness” can run the gamut in terms of what it could require.\n79 Tallinn Manual 2.0, supra note 1, at 82 (noting, in addition, that the available information considered need not be restricted to technical intelligence if it can be supplemented with highly reliable human intelligence).\n80 See Jules Lobel, Colloquy, The Use of Force to Respond to Terrorist Attacks: The Bombing of Sudan and Afghanistan, 24 Yale J.

The commentary accompanying the Draft Articles on State Responsibility notes:\nIn a bilateral dispute over State responsibility, the onus of establishing responsibility lies in principle on the claimant State. Where conduct in conflict with an international obligation is attributable to a State and that State seeks to avoid its responsibility by relying on a circumstance under chapter V [which describes circumstances precluding wrongfulness], however, the position changes and the onus lies on that State to justify or excuse its conduct.⁸⁵\nThis is echoed in the ICJ’s judgment in the *Oil Platforms* case.⁸⁶ In that case, the ICJ indicated that the United States bore the burden of proving that Iranian forces fired a missile at the *Sea Isle City*, a Kuwaiti tanker reflagged to the United States, which had made a defensive claim for which it used this evidence as the factual basis.⁸⁷\n⁸³ Banks, supra note 2, at 1507; see Cyber Warfare in the 21st Century: Threats, Challenges, and Opportunities: Hearing Before the H.

Does International Law Already Contain a General Attribution Standard?\nDrawing from the above, it would seem that, at present, no state under international law carries an obligation of publicly proving its attributional claim by revealing the available evidence, whether that be in the cyber or conventional force context.⁸⁸ Nor does it seem that states carry a well-defined burden under international law related to the quality or amount of evidence used in proving an attributional claim before undertaking acts of self-defense or countermeasures against the accused state.⁸⁹ Further, strikingly few commentators have even addressed the issue of evidentiary burdens under international law. But despite the IGE’s findings and the claims that states like the United States have made about (non-)obligations under international law, there is a contingent of those few who have argued the contrary. Such commentators claim that sufficient state practice exists to locate the standard of proof required of attribution claims.⁹⁰\nProfessor Mary Ellen O’Connell has argued that, at least in situations in which states are justifying the use of force under Article 51’s self-defense provision, state practice and the decisions of international courts and tribunals support a “clear and convincing” standard in evaluating evidence.⁹¹ She claims that “the international authority for the standard consists of several\n⁸⁸ See also Banks, supra note 2, at 1499 (“Applying the Rules on State Responsibility and attribution compiled in Tallinn 2.0, there is no burden of proof or requirement that there exists definitive information on attribution. Although wise as a matter of policy, the failure to offer persuasive evidence of State attribution is not wrongful legally.”); Lobel, supra note 80, at 538 (discussing how the lack of an “international judicial or other centralized fact-finding mechanism” means that the states assess factual claims on an “ad hoc” basis).\n⁸⁹ Banks, supra note 2, at 1499.\n⁹⁰ See, e.g., O’Connell, supra note 68 (claiming a clear and convincing standard of proof for uses of force under Article 51 of the U.N. Charter); see Robin Geiß &amp; Henning Lahmann, Freedom and Security in Cyberspace: Shifting the Focus Away From Military Responses Towards Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention, in Peacetime Regime for State Activities in Cyberspace: International Law, International Relations and Diplomacy 621, 624 (Katharina Ziolkowski ed., 2013) (arguing that a “clear and convincing” standard has been applied in ICJ decisions governing state responsibility). Professor O’Connell’s paper arguing that a clear-and-convincing has proven the most influential out of those few that argue in favor of its existence, and so my argument places the most emphasis on defusing the claim as she describes it.\n⁹¹ O’Connell, supra note 68, at 21–28; see Geiß &amp; Lahmann, Freedom and Security in Cyberspace: Shifting the Focus Away From Military Responses Towards Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention, in Peacetime Regime for State Activities in Cyberspace: International Law, International Relations and Diplomacy, supra note 90, at 624 (arguing that the “clear and convincing” standard was applied by the ICJ implicitly in the its decisions in the Nicaragua case, Oil Platforms case, and Armed Activities case).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202\nLefebvre\nCracking Attribution\n21\ndecisions of international courts and tribunals, including the implicit standard in the Nicaragua case.” She also finds support in the statements of U.S. officials characterizing evidence as “clear,” “convincing,” and “compelling” before or after launching counter-attacks in response to terrorist attacks, including the 1986 bombing of Libya in response to the infamous West Berlin discotheque attack that same year, a 1993 attack against Iraq after an alleged assassination attempt against former President George H.W. Bush, and the 1998 bombing of Sudan and Afghanistan after attacks on U.S. embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam.⁹² Professor O’Connell’s evidence for such claims raises questions, however, about whether such an obligation truly exists under international law.\nFirst, while she cites examples of state practice of injured states using language indicating that they are in possession of “clear,” “compelling,” or “convincing” evidence of having suffered an internationally wrongful act at the hand of a particular state, there is no indication that this is done out of a sense of legal obligation.⁹³ State practice on its own is insufficient to establish customary international law; it is only when it is done out of a sense of legal obligation, or *opinio juris*, that it can be considered customary international law. Further, the fact that she only cites U.S. practice draws into question whether one state’s practice is enough, even if the United States were acting out of a sense of legal obligation. Lastly, the United States and any number of other states have a multitude of political reasons to indicate that they are in possession of “clear” or “convincing” evidence. There is no suggestion that such states believe that this is an evidentiary floor that must be met under international law before they can act on the evidence in their possession.\n⁹² O’Connell, supra note 31, at 23–28.\n⁹³ But see Mark Landler &amp; Michael R. Gordon, *Air War in Kosovo Seen as Precedent in Possible Response to Syria Chemical Attack*, N.Y.

The ICJ’s opinion in the Nicaragua case, which these commentators claim supports a “clear and convincing” standard,⁹⁵ suggests that its standard of proof derives from Article 53 of the Statute on the International Court of Justice,⁹⁶ which does not purport to have impact outside of the operations of that court.⁹⁷ Further, O'Connell’s evidence that the ICJ uses a “clear and compelling” standard of proof is limited to consistent references to whether evidence is “sufficient” or “insufficient.”⁹⁸ But declaring whether a particular amount of evidence is sufficient is distinct from whether it is necessary. Indeed, the ICJ’s opinion merely points to the fact that evidence has met or surpassed the necessary standard of proof; it does not indicate what that standard is. While the ICJ does mention that its findings of fact should be based upon “convincing” evidence, it includes a caveat: that it should only do so to the extent that “the nature of the case permits.”⁹⁹ This seems to suggest a shifting standard of proof, determined on the basis of the availability and nature of the facts.\nProfessors Robin Geiß and Henning Lahmann make similar claims about the standard of proof in the Oil Platforms and Armed Attacks cases, claiming the ICJ uses an implicit “clear and convincing” standard.¹⁰⁰ But again, the ICJ in the Oil Platforms case merely refers to the\n⁹⁴ O'Connell, supra note 68, at 23–24; Geiß &amp; Lahmann, supra note 90, at 624; see also Marco Roscini, Symposium, Evidentiary Issues Related to Cyber Operations, 50 Tex.

Indeed, the ICJ’s proceedings only require enough proof to “satisfy” the ICJ in law and in fact, a rather flexible standard.¹⁰³ Conceivably, as the ICJ suggested in its decision in the Nicaragua case, the ICJ may find itself satisfied with applying different standards of proof in different contexts, depending on the amount of evidence available or the difficulty in proving particular claims. This makes it even more difficult to make an inference about the standard it is using to judge the facts before it.¹⁰⁴ Particularly since there is little state practice and no apparent opinio juris to support a standard of proof for state attribution claims against other states for a breach of an international obligation,¹⁰⁵ any inferences about the standard of proof used by the ICJ appear to be cabined to that international body.¹⁰⁶ This only becomes clearer when one considers that the ICJ derives its power to set a standard of proof from its foundational statute. It is not derived from principles of customary international law or some other species of international law that has broad impact\n¹⁰¹ Case Concerning Oil Platforms (Islamic Republic of Iran v.

The Value of a Sliding-Scale Attribution Standard\nThe absence of a standard of proof in these matters may be surprising, but it is likely—at least in part—a reflection of the reluctance among nations to share closely guarded intelligence methods on a global stage in front of ally and adversary alike.¹⁰⁸ There is little doubt, however, that developing international norms to establish a standard of proof for attributional claims before undertaking countermeasures or self-defense measures would force states to exercise restraint in using these tools. One would hope that such restraint could help prevent conflicts from escalating or even spilling over into wrongly accused states that had no previous role in a particular conflict.¹⁰⁹ Problems arise, though, in determining how high such a standard should be for cyber operations, given the difficulty many states face in being able to make an attributional claim with a high degree of confidence in a short amount of time. Any standard of proof employed should be sufficiently flexible to allow a state to act quickly enough for its countermeasures to serve as an adequate means of forcing the offending state back into compliance with its international\n¹⁰⁷ See Statute of the International Court of Justice, June 26, 1945, art. 53(2), 59 Stat. 1055, 1062, T.S. No. 993.\n¹⁰⁸ The reluctance, of course, is not unfounded. Sharing intelligence with adversaries can better clue them into the methods of the victim state’s intelligence collection, helping adversaries to better identify their own security vulnerabilities. For one example of how providing intelligence can change an adversary’s behavior in a way that threatens a state’s national security, see Eric Schmitt &amp; Michael S. Schmidt, *Queda Plot Leak Has Undermined U.S. Intelligence*, N.Y. Times (Sept. 29, 2013), https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/30/us/qaeda-plot-leak-has-undermined-us-intelligence.html (describing how after an intelligence leak, analysis have detected a sharp drop in terrorists’ use of a major communications channel that had been monitored by U.S. officials).\n¹⁰⁹ U.N.

Such difficulty might be resolved by applying a shifting standard of proof, not unlike what the ICJ appears to employ based upon “the nature of the case.”\nA standard of proof tied to the anticipated severity of the victim state’s response rather than to the severity of the underlying breach might meet the goals of timely response while adapting to the lower quality and quantity of evidence available to the victim state shortly after suffering an offensive cyber operation.¹¹⁰ For example, the victim state might only need to find on the balance of evidence that a particular state is responsible for an offensive cyber operation if deploying countermeasures, such as the violation of a treaty between the victim and aggressor states, but it may need clear-and-convincing evidence to respond with a use of armed force. This proposal falls in line with the second Tallinn Manual’s suggestion that “the greater the underlying breach . . . the greater the confidence ought to be in the evidence relied upon by a State considering a response” since the “robustness of permissible self-help responses grows commensurately with the seriousness of the breach.”¹¹¹ For example, a state should be more confident in its attribution when it responds with armed force to a cyber attack on an air traffic control system that resulted in aircraft accidents and fatalities. The same should be expected if it were to suffer an attack on the underground pump controllers for an underground rail system that resulted in major flooding and destruction of its infrastructure. If a state were to suffer a denial of service attack on the website of a regulatory agency that issues permits for hunting and fishing, however, principles of necessity and proportionality dictate that the victim state would only be permitted to respond with something\n¹¹⁰ Professors Christian Payne and Lorraine Finlay have proposed a standard of proof tied to the victim’s response, but they have failed to provide much detail other than suggesting victim states that “pursue peaceful, legal processes” for resolving disputes related to cyber operations should “have the benefit of eschewing stringent attribution tests normally required.” Payne &amp; Finlay, supra note 5, at 567. In such cases, they suggest strict liability for those states that the victim state believes to be the host states for the attack. Id. at 566–67. They do not discuss the standard of proof necessary to undertake countermeasures and argue that the “effective control” standard is required for self-defense measures. Id.; see also infra note 132 and accompanying text (discussing the “effective control” standard).\n¹¹¹ Tallinn Manual 2.0, supra note 1, at 82 (citing Oil Platforms, 2003 I.C.J. at ¶ 67 (separate opinion of Judge Higgins)).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202\nLefebvre\nCracking Attribution\n26\nbelow the use of force, such as committing a violation of a trade or tax treaty between the two states.¹¹²\nUnder a shifting standard of proof for attributional claims, a state could respond to the first two examples with countermeasures if it perhaps only had probable cause that a given state had conducted the attacks. After acquiring evidence to prove its attributional claim at a higher standard of proof, such as clear-and-convincing evidence, a state could respond with armed force if it were to conclude that such force would be proportional and necessary to repel the attack or later attacks.¹¹³ This shifting standard of proof does not change the ultimate severity ceiling of the response available to the victim state, which is still tied to the underlying breach and governed by principles of proportionality and necessity; rather, it adapts the severity of the response to the standard of proof that the victim state is able to meet at any given point.¹¹⁴ This would allow victim states to respond—at least in some fashion—more quickly, and thereby more effectively, to offensive cyber operations than if a higher evidentiary threshold were required uniformly among all types of responses. Victim states, of course, could still increase the severity of their responses as needed to force the attacking state back into compliance with its international obligations, so long as the certainty in the attacker’s identity correspondingly increased.\nAdmittedly, such a standard might result in more severe and more frequent state responses against less sophisticated actors—who lack the ability to hide the evidence that leads to their identity—than sophisticated actors. But this is no different than any other system that requires evidentiary burdens to be met before responsive measures can be taken: even in domestic criminal\n¹¹² See infra note 113.\n¹¹³ International Governmental Group of Experts, Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare 61 (Michael N. Schmitt ed., 2013).\n¹¹⁴ While outside the scope of this Note, there is no reason why such a standard could not be tied to any use of force, whether it be conventional or cyber. Indeed, there is a colorable argument that it would be wise to apply such a standard beyond the cyber context, particularly given the ad hoc factual evaluation of conventional use of force events and their associated attribution problems.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202\nLefebvre\nCracking Attribution\n27\nlaw systems, sophisticated criminals are less likely to be punished than the amateur thief. Further, and more importantly, the proposed evidentiary framework will create opportunities for states to take measures against actors whose sophistication in hiding their identity would, under a more exacting standard of proof, leave victims without any recourse time and time again.\nPart II further explores how evaluations of such evidence could be more publicly accountable by allowing states to submit their claims to a neutral body that would provide an attributional assessment of the offensive cyber operation, including a forensic report and a confidence judgment as to the culprit. It also examines how such a body could contribute to the creation of international norms—and, eventually, customary international law—that integrate this sliding-scale evidentiary framework and which make it clear what standard of proof a state should have to meet before responding with the use of force or countermeasures. In this way, the body could create a platform through which states could better define customary international law, even where attempts to build positive international law have stalled or failed.^[115]^\n## D. Frameworks for Assessing State Responsibility for Cyber Operations\nIn contrast with standards of proof, principles of state responsibility are far better defined under international law, thanks to the ICJ's jurisprudence and the International Law Commission's (\"ILC\") Articles on State Responsibility. As a result, the second Tallinn Manual provides far more guidance about principles of state responsibility as they relate to cyber operations, beginning with Tallinn Rule 14's threshold^[116]^: \"A State bears international responsibility for a cyber-related act\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202\nLefebvre\nCracking Attribution\n28\nthat is attributable to the State and that constitutes a breach of an international legal obligation.”¹¹⁷ Rules 15–18 particularize this requirement by adapting it to common situations, with each rule further attenuating the relation from the responsible state. Rule 15 indicates that states are responsible for cyber operations conducted by their own organs and individual representatives of the state who are authorized to exercise the governmental authority of the state.¹¹⁸ Rule 16 addresses situations in which a state places one of its organs at the disposal of another state. It indicates that cyber operations are attributable to the latter state so long as it is exercising government authority over the former state’s organ.¹¹⁹ Rule 17 deals with state control of non-state actors. It identifies that the state is responsible for those cyber operations committed by non-state actors that it directs, controls, or that the state acknowledges and adopts as its own, reflecting the concept of “effective control” articulated in the Nicaragua case.¹²⁰ Rule 18 deals with a state’s responsibility for the cyber operations of foreign states, concluding that one state bears responsibility for another’s cyber operation when, knowing of the act’s wrongful character, it either coerces, aids or assists, or directs and controls that state in the operation.¹²¹ As a result of the distributed nature of the Internet, the second Tallinn Manual took the view that geography is of little importance into inquiries of state responsibility.¹²² Instead, the inquiry is almost entirely grounded in the instruction received and control exercised by any given state.¹²³\n¹¹⁷ Tallinn Manual 2.0, supra note 1, at 84. The language “breach of an international legal obligation” is particularly important, since it does not include activities that are either unregulated by international law, such as cyber espionage and related intelligence gathering, or are expressly permitted, such as suspension of international cyber communication services within its territory.

Despite differences in what evidence is required, the evidentiary standard remains the same for each.¹²⁷ Thus, in order to reach an attribution conclusion, the analysis developed in the previous Section should be applied not just to factual determinations that lead to the identities of individual cyber operators, but to factual determinations that lead to conclusions about state responsibility.\n## II. MOVING TOWARD A GLOBAL CONSORTIUM\nDespite the risk of global destabilization that cyber capabilities pose, there are at present no international bodies or meaningful multilateral treaties that regulate their use or encourage state compliance with obligations under international law.¹²⁸ As noted above, the lack of international\n¹²⁴ Id. at 30.\n¹²⁵ Id. at 30, 83.\n¹²⁶ Geiß &amp; Lahmann, supra note 28, at 634, 636–37.\n¹²⁷ Id. at 81–82.\n¹²⁸ Elena Chernenko et al., Increasing International Cooperation in Cybersecurity and Adapting Cyber Norms, Council on Foreign Relations (Feb. 23, 2018), https://www.cfr.org/report/increasing-international-cooperation-cybersecurity-and-adapting-cyber-norms.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202\nLefebvre\nCracking Attribution\n30\nnorms governing activities in cyberspace, the technical challenges surrounding attribution, and the fact that these capabilities can be easily hidden until deployed make cyber capabilities particularly difficult to monitor.\nWhile Russia and China support a cyber treaty regulating the use of cyber “weapons,” the United States does not, preferring instead to direct efforts toward developing international norms around the use of cyber capabilities.¹²⁹ Given the United States’ role in the international community and its strength in the cyber landscape, there is little hope of building a productive multilateral agreement without its support.¹³⁰ But the United States’ preferred path forward has encountered its own roadblocks after the collapse of consensus among the U.N. Group of Governmental Experts on Information Security, a multilateral attempt to more firmly establish customary international law in the cyber context.¹³¹\nSome, most notably Microsoft Corporation, the Atlantic Council, and the RAND Corporation, have called for the creation of an attributional organization that would investigate offensive cyber operations and provide assessments on the identity of the likely culprit or culprits. Microsoft and the Atlantic Council have suggested that the body be built as an intergovernmental compliance and attribution body akin to the International Atomic Energy Agency (“IAEA”) or the\n¹²⁹ International Cybersecurity Strategy: Deterring Foreign Threats and Building Global Cyber Norms: Hearing Before the Subcomm.

This is in part because the United States takes an “effects” view the term “cyber weapon,” rather than seeing them as a class of tools that are identifiable as weapons in and of themselves. That is to say, the United States considers a cyber tool a weapon based on the effects of its use rather than based on the nature of its architecture. This may be driven by differences in how the United States, Russia, and China view “information” as a threat to national security.

The IAEA and OPCW are built upon formal arms control, prohibition, or inspection agreements that are unlikely to be replicated in the cyber context in the foreseeable future.¹³³ Their development was also likely further aided by the high barriers to attaining, maintaining, and deploying the capabilities they sought to regulate; such barriers are far higher than those surrounding the accessibility of cyber capabilities.¹³⁴ Further, the IAEA is an organ of the United Nations and membership in its two policymaking bodies, the Board of Governors and the General Conference of IAEA Member States, is limited to states.¹³⁵ While the OPCW is independent from the United Nations, its governing body is also limited to member states, as is its General Conference.¹³⁶ The IAEA and OPCW, appropriately, have been lauded for their work, but the inclusion of states in the membership of any attributional or investigative body creates risks for that body’s neutrality and the perceived legitimacy of its judgments.¹³⁷ Indeed, this risk might be greater in the cyber context. Particularly because of the difficulty involved in establishing high-confidence technical attribution, the judgments of a cyber attribution body could be subject to significant politicization—or, at the very least, perceived politicization—by member states, providing another\n¹³² Charney et al., Microsoft Corp., supra note 12, at 11.\n¹³³ See Dan Efrony, Is it Time to Regulate Cyber Conflicts?, Lawfare (May 4, 2018, 7:00 AM), https://lawfareblog.com/it-time-regulate-cyber-conflicts; Davis et al., RAND Corp., supra note 51, at 31; supra note 129 and accompanying text.\n¹³⁴ Payne &amp; Finlay, supra note 5, at 556, 560; Johnson, supra note 46.\n¹³⁵ See Board of Governors, About Us, Governance, International Atomic Energy Agency, https://www.iaea.org/about/governance/board-of-governors (last visited May 5, 2018).\n¹³⁶ Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction, art. 8, January 13, 1993, S.

Building a Private Body for a Public Good\nIn 2017, researchers at the RAND Corporation published a white paper proposing the creation of an attributional organization that would exclude states from its management and operation, referring to the proposed body as the “Global Cyber Attribution Consortium” (“the Consortium”).¹⁴⁰ Instead of states, RAND proposes that the body be managed and operated by cyberspace legal and policy experts, international policy experts from academia and research organizations, and technical experts from academia as well as cybersecurity and information technology companies.¹⁴¹ RAND recognizes that these actors are not immune to politicization: they may face pressures from their home markets or states of incorporation, or they may inherently possess strong national loyalties. But such a body would at least be further removed from state political interests and face more political accountability at the international level, to the extent that the companies and research organizations involved conduct global operations.¹⁴² Most\n¹³⁸ Davis et al., RAND Corp., supra note 51, at 31; see Efrony, supra note 133 (“None of the experts should be simultaneously employed by governmental institutions to avoid even the appearance of conflicts of interest.”).\n¹³⁹ Davis et al., RAND Corp., supra note 51, at 31.\n¹⁴⁰ Id at 27, 33. To be clear, by using the term “attribution organization,” the suggestion is that the organization engages exclusively in attributional assessments. Unlike the proposals suggested by Microsoft and the Atlantic Council, it has no enforcement function. See Charney, Microsoft Corp., supra note 12, at 11; Jason Healey, et al., Atlantic Council, Confidence-Building Measures in Cyberspace: A Multistakeholder Approach for Stability and Security 10 (2014).\n¹⁴¹ Davis et al., RAND Corp., supra note 51, at 29; see also Efrony, supra note 133 (supporting the idea of excluding states from a global attribution body).\n¹⁴² Admittedly, “global operations” does not mean such operations will be equal among all states. One might argue that states with more sophisticated technology sectors could have more influence over the Consortium than states with less sophisticated technology sectors, since such countries will likely have stronger ties to members of the Consortium. But given the wide network of global interests and partnerships that states with sophisticated technology sectors have, which often tie them to states with smaller technology sectors, it is unlikely that the Consortium could or would privilege states along this line. Consider, for example, Russia’s collaborative interests with Iran, or the United States’ strong relationship with Afghanistan. Given this, the more relevant distinction may be between those states with friends and those without.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202\nLefebvre\nCracking Attribution\n33\nimportantly, it would be less likely that governing and operational member organizations would have played a role in the offensive operations under the Consortium’s investigation than if the Consortium included states as members.\nJust being further removed from the risk of politicization, however, is not enough. The nature of the organization’s work requires not only a better reputation for neutrality than what could be accomplished with an intergovernmental organization, but an incredibly strong reputation for neutrality and expertise. This would, at a minimum, require geographic diversity from each of the sectors represented and strict transparency in both its governance and evaluation methodologies and procedures.¹⁴³ As RAND puts it, with no international norms to rely upon at present, the Consortium can only derive its legitimacy over time from “the reputation and credibility gained from the technical expertise of its diverse global membership and its commitment to objectivity and transparency in its attribution findings.”¹⁴⁴\nTo deliver on the promise of providing more reliable and transparent attributional assessments than what states have offered to date, the Consortium would need to include formalized conditions that trigger its review, standardized processes for evidence collection and assessment, attribution-confidence standards, procedures for notification and publication of results, and standardized procedures to assess the severity and sophistication of offensive operations.¹⁴⁵ Indeed, standardization and transparency are two crucial elements missing from the current diffuse attribution regime. As discussed, because of the lack of clear evidentiary standards, states at present have little incentive to be transparent in their technical analysis.¹⁴⁶ Further, even\n¹⁴³ See Davis et al., RAND Corp., supra note 51, at 30.\n¹⁴⁴ Id.\n¹⁴⁵ Davis et al., RAND Corp., supra note 51, at 35.\n¹⁴⁶ See supra Section I.C.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202\nLefebvre\nCracking Attribution\n34\nthough cybersecurity firms have been more transparent in their investigative reports of cyber incidents, they use diverging assessment procedures and nomenclatures, making it difficult to compile the bodies of evidence over time.¹⁴⁷ A centralized leader in attribution would be able to develop standardized nomenclature, attribution-confidence standards, and other best practices to improve not just the quality of its own assessments, but help promote effective and standardized attribution practices globally.¹⁴⁸ A body led in part by the world’s leading cybersecurity and information technology firms might be particularly well positioned to build and promote these best practices. Because such firms hold significant influence in the industry, they could integrate the standardized practices developed for the Consortium into the investigative procedures that they conduct independently for clients of their business units, pushing the entire industry toward standardization. This is a key benefit of the Consortium, since—given the incredible variety and number of offensive cyber operations carried out—RAND envisions the body having a discretionary docket.¹⁴⁹ For example, the Consortium may choose to take up an attack that destroyed petrochemical refineries, electrical grids, or nuclear reactors but be forced to turn down requests to investigate low-level denial-of-service attacks.¹⁵⁰ After conducting the investigation, the Consortium would provide its forensic report, attribution assessment, and the confidence level\n¹⁴⁷ See Davis et al., RAND Corp., supra note 51, at 20; Max Smeets, When Naming Cyber Threat Actors Does More Harm Than Good, Council on Foreign Relations: Blog (Oct. 24, 2016), https://www.cfr.org/blog/when-naming-cyber-threat-actors-does-more-harm-good (“First, if a competitor has already discovered a threat actor, the threat actor shouldn’t be renamed to fit another company’s branding.

While the Consortium would only begin an investigation at the request of the victim,¹⁵² the question remains, at least in some cases, as to which victim would have the proper standing to file a request with the Consortium.¹⁵³ For example, if an electrical utility suffers an attack on its infrastructure, does the state retain exclusive rights to trigger the investigation and publicize the results or should the utility company have the ability to file an investigation request? RAND suggests leaving such decisions up to the discretion of the Consortium.¹⁵⁴ But granting a private entity standing to bring an investigation request makes little sense, particularly given the consequences for the victim state if the operation were publicized and a state or non-state actor were accused. At the time of the request’s filing, there may be little clue as to the identity of the attacker. The risks of giving a private entity the right to publicize attacks and accuse another state with the Consortium’s platform and credibility behind its claim could cause significant difficulties for states in planning and conducting their international relations.¹⁵⁵ While private entities may be hesitant to report attacks to their host states—particularly if they might be liable in some way for the intrusion—these concerns make it more prudent to favor giving states exclusive standing to bring the claim and to publicize the results.\n¹⁵¹ Id. at 39.\n¹⁵² Id.\n¹⁵³ Id. at 36.\n¹⁵⁴ Id.\n¹⁵⁵ This concern resembles those that some have been expressed about claims made under the Alien Tort Statute and their potential to interfere with the foreign affairs of the United States.

Consider, for example, a scenario in which an actor conducts an offensive cyber operation against a company incorporated in the United States with its principal place of business in the United States. Suppose, however, that the company also has offices in Beijing and the offensive cyber operation was conducted exclusively against the company’s servers in Beijing, resulting in significant physical destruction of company property and the death of one or more U.S. nationals. On one hand, one might think that the United States is the victim state, since a kinetic attack was conducted against its nationals and their property.¹⁵⁶ However, if the culprit is a foreign state, China would have suffered an armed attack and a violation of its territorial integrity.¹⁵⁷ But depending on the circumstances surrounding the attack, there might even be reasonable suspicion that China itself is the culprit. Which state should be able to bring the episode to the Consortium? The answer, at least on these facts, seems to be that both states should have standing to bring the investigation request. But even if both parties have standing, should both enjoy the right to publicize the result? If the United States wanted to publicize the result, but China did not, should China retain a veto over the United States’ decision to publicize? The answer to that question is unclear, but it demonstrates that standing to bring an investigation request may not necessarily track with the right to publicize the result. It would seem prudent, despite the international relations costs, for the Consortium to tie standing with the exclusive right to publicize the results: divvying\n¹⁵⁶ Even if the United States did not suffer a use of force or armed attack against its territorial integrity or political independence in this scenario, it was a victim of an Article 2(4) violation if one takes a somewhat broader conception of the provision. One state killing the nationals of another state would, at the very least, be activity “inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations.” U.N. Charter art. 2(4). Customary international law’s doctrine permitting the protection of nationals abroad seems to reflect that this is a sensible construction as does the principle of passive personality. See Restatement (Third) of the Foreign Relations Law of the U.S., § 402 cmt. g (Am. Law. Inst. 1987) (passive personality principle); Andrew W.R. Thomson, Doctrine of the Protection of Nationals Abroad: Rise of the Non-Combatant Evacuation Operation, 11 Wash. Univ. Global Studs. L. Rev. 627, 628–29 (2011) (protection of nationals abroad principle); see also 2 Vattel, The Law of Nations; or Principles of the Law of Nature; Applied to the Conduct and Affairs of Nations and Sovereigns § 71 (Joseph Chitty ed., Philadelphia, T.&amp;J.W. Johnson &amp; Co. 1872) (“Whoever uses a citizen ill, indirectly offends the State, which is bound; to protect this citizen; and the sovereign of the latter should avenge his wrongs, punish the aggressor, and, if possible, oblige him to make full reparation; since otherwise the citizen would not obtain the great end of the civil association, which is, safety.”).\n¹⁵⁷ Tallinn Manual 2.0, supra note 1, at 340–41.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202\nLefebvre\nCracking Attribution\n37\nup the right to publicize so that multiple victims have the ability to exercise veto power will only lead to fewer publicized judgments, one of the critical needs the Consortium is designed to meet. Regardless, the Consortium’s discretion will become critical in its standing determinations, since its legitimacy and neutrality could be at risk depending on how it chooses to decide these issues.\nAt least in what might be expected in the typical case, where it is clear which state has both standing to bring the request and the right to publicize results, the Consortium’s work functions similarly to a pretrial hearing in the United States, where the Consortium acts as both factfinder and judge. While this is yet another area that the RAND proposal does not discuss with much depth, it would be sensible for the Consortium to provide the accused state with an advance copy of the Consortium’s report and an opportunity to rebut its conclusion and aspects of forensic report. This stage of the investigation could provide victim states with an opportunity to supplement the technical report from the Consortium’s forensic investigation with evidence gained through the victim state’s intelligence capabilities, such as from SIGINT and HUMINT, perhaps presenting such information to the Consortium in camera. To the extent a victim state is unwilling to share its intelligence with the Consortium, the only cost would be a lower confidence level in the attribution assessment than the Consortium would otherwise be able to provide. Alternatively, the Consortium might be able to release its forensic report and confidence assessment of the identity of the individual operators but provide a no-confidence or low-confidence assessment of state responsibility. Such a report would, at the very least, be valuable if the victim state chose to indict the operators under its domestic criminal law.¹⁵⁸\n¹⁵⁸ See, e.g., Press Release, U.S. Dep’t of Justice, North Korean Regime-Backed Programmer Charged with Conspiracy to Conduct Multiple Cyber Attacks and Intrusions (Sept. 6, 2018), https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/north-korean-regime-backed-programmer-charged-conspiracy-conduct-multiple-cyber-attacks-and.

Filling the Evidentiary Gap and Building International Norms\nEven if the Consortium did not grant every investigation request it received, it still would have the potential to shift international norms toward stricter and more uniform standards of proof for attribution claims, paving the way for the sliding-scale evidentiary framework proposed in Part I. Further, in the investigations it would accept, its technical capabilities could still help to fill the evidentiary gap that states face in justifying countermeasures or self-defense, especially where the victim state’s technical capabilities are lacking.\nTo the extent that states are able to point to an independent body’s declassified cyber forensic investigation, a state’s justification for countermeasures would be built on firmer factual ground than if it only had its classified intelligence to rely upon. With a reduced ability to hide behind a claim of pretextual or false accusation, states might exercise more caution in conducting offensive cyber operations or might restrict themselves to low-level uses of force so as not to draw attention of the Consortium.¹⁵⁹ This is true whether or not key players in the international community choose to submit a case to the Consortium. One may expect that the United States, China, Israel, or Russia may at first feel more comfortable relying upon the technical sophistication of their own intelligence communities to reliably identify culprits and might reject opening up the process to an independent body. But unlike with the political backing needed in a multilateral treaty, the Consortium could still provide much-needed technical assistance to less sophisticated middle-power and developing states that are targets of cyber attacks and exploitations, without the\nConducting Coordinated Campaign of Cyber Attacks Against U.S. Financial Sector (March 24, 2016), https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/seven-iranians-working-islamic-revolutionary-guard-corps-affiliated-entities-charged; Press Release, U.S. Dep’t Justice, U.S. Charges Five Chinese Military Hackers for Cyber Espionage Against U.S. Corporations and a Labor Organization for Commercial Advantage, (May 19, 2014), https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/us-charges-five-chinese-military-hackers-cyber-espionage-against-us-corporations-and-labor.\n¹⁵⁹ At least part of the blame for the difficulties of deterring offensive cyber operations lies with the challenges in reliably attributing the operations to the correct culprit.

Rather than have states act as their own judges of how much proof is necessary to respond to an attack,¹⁶² states might feel they are obligated to justify their actions in the face of a quantifiable confidence metric.\nStates might also choose to reference such assessments in their domestic prosecutions of the accused individuals. The United States, for example, has issued indictments against a number of foreign officials and others who use cyber operations to threaten U.S. national security.¹⁶³ If other states had access to similar technical resources to attribute attacks with a high enough degree\n¹⁶⁰ See U.N. Secretary-General, Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security 18, U.N. Doc.

Of course, while the governments of superpowered states are not necessary, the talent that resides within their territory would be.\n¹⁶¹ See Efrony, supra note 133 (supporting the notion that if attribution is built on transparent and objective parameters, other states would follow it, contributing to state practice).\n¹⁶² See supra note 78 and accompanying text.\n¹⁶³ Ashley Deeks, Moving Forward on Cyber Norms, Domestically, Lawfare (July 10, 2017, 1:10PM) https://lawfareblog.com/moving-forward-cyber-norms-domestically; see, e.g., sources cited supra note 158.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202\nLefebvre\nCracking Attribution\n40\nof confidence for prosecution—resources that the Consortium could provide—others could follow in the footsteps of the United States. While domestic prosecutions might not do much to shape international norms around the level of confidence needed to institute countermeasures or engage in self-defense, they could help build international norms for acceptable and unacceptable behavior in cyberspace.¹⁶⁴ By building out international norms, customary international law could develop around evidentiary standards and behavior in cyberspace where top-down diplomacy and positive law efforts have largely stalled or failed.¹⁶⁵\n## C. Challenges Ahead\nDespite the promise an independent non-governmental attribution body like the Consortium holds for building international norms, challenges remain for the Consortium’s effective execution. If independence is a key feature, from what sources could it responsibly derive funding? How will such a body prioritize its investigations and how will it deliver results quickly enough to meet the need for timely response that victim states will face? Further, without traditional sources of intelligence at hand, how will such a body meet the need to connect an operator’s activity with state direction and control in the case of state-sponsored attacks?\nRAND suggests initial funding from philanthropic sources and the inclusion of a charter mandate to seek funding from the United Nations at a later point.¹⁶⁶ RAND also points to the possibility of funding from cybersecurity and information technology companies that operate and defend much of the infrastructure upon which attacks are launched.¹⁶⁷ This might not be so far-fetched: if the Consortium were able to build a strong reputation in the international community,\n¹⁶⁴ Deeks, supra note 163.\n¹⁶⁵ See supra note 115.\n¹⁶⁶ Davis et al., RAND Corp., supra note 51, at 44.\n¹⁶⁷ Id. at 45.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202\nLefebvre\nCracking Attribution\n41\nparticipation might be a badge of honor for private sector firms, translating to increased business opportunities.\nIf it could be done transparently, this Note suggests another solution: the Consortium might even charge clients fees for attribution services, in accordance with their ability to pay, basing its schedule off of the United Nations’ scale of assessments for the apportionment of its expenses.¹⁶⁸ Admittedly, this might introduce risks to its neutrality if the organization appears to demonstrate something akin to customer loyalty. If any attribution body were to accept fees for its services to offset its costs, its revenue streams would need to be diversified enough to prevent reliance on fees from any particular state, region, or global bloc.\nDeveloping prioritization policies may best be left to the discretion of the Consortium, given the variety of effects cyber attacks produce and the difficulty in organizing attacks by their severity. For example, the Consortium might be forced to choose between investigating a cyber attack that resulted in an explosion that killed tens of people or a ransomware attack that paralyzed the state’s ability to provide key services and cost its citizens and businesses hundreds of millions of dollars and maybe, indirectly, loss of life.¹⁶⁹ In this case, one might suggest investigating the former first, since the victim state in that case would have suffered an armed attack under the effects test¹⁷⁰ and would have the right to respond in self-defense, if such measures were necessary to prevent future attacks.¹⁷¹ However, one can imagine murkier cases where the severity might be tied to the degree of harm suffered by the victim. For example, two ostensibly different attacks on two different central bank accounts might result in the same amount of money lost, but one of\n¹⁶⁸ Cf. G.A. Res. 70/245 (December 23, 2015) (detailing the U.N. scale of assessments).\n¹⁶⁹ Cf. supra note 6–7 and accompanying text (detailing cyber attacks that either did or would have resulted in similar damage).\n¹⁷⁰ Tallinn Manual 2.0, supra note 1, at 340–41.\n¹⁷¹ U.N. Charter, art. 51.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202\nLefebvre\nCracking Attribution\n42\nthese attacks might cause more harm to one victim state than the other, based on the relative wealth of the two states.\nEven if the Consortium were able to develop severity prioritization rules, the body might not be able to complete the investigation in a timely enough fashion for a state to respond. If a state continues to suffer armed attacks or uses of force, the victim might need to respond with self-defense measures under Article 51 or enact countermeasures in order to bring the culprit back into compliance with its international obligations. In such a situation, the Consortium might be able to release preliminary findings at a lower confidence level. Acting on any such findings could operate under a “buyer beware” framework, a concept that would tie nicely with the sliding-scale evidentiary framework proposed in Section I.C.¹⁷² Over time, international norms—and perhaps, eventually, customary international law—could be built around the level of confidence expected from attributional assessments before a state could pursue countermeasures, invoke pleas of necessity, or undertake acts of self-defense. The Consortium’s findings would make the adoption of this sliding-scale evidentiary framework more easily possible, since the findings would provide a quantifiable, standardized, and easily referenced confidence level for the international community to debate. Over time, this transparency could help develop international law’s standards of proof by providing more transparent examples of state practice, leading to easier identification of the *opinio juris* needed to locate customary international law. For example, one might find, after mapping the Consortium’s confidence levels of its attribution assessments to the corresponding state responses, that states are only willing to enact countermeasures on confidence levels of fifty percent or higher and self-defense measures on confidence levels of seventy-five percent or higher.\n¹⁷² See supra note 109–111 and accompanying text.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202\nLefebvre\nCracking Attribution\n43\nWhile forensic analyses can assess the sophistication levels of threat actors and can support inferences about state involvement based on the sophistication of the attack, making state responsibility claims will be difficult, especially if states begin to contract out more and more offensive cyber operations to non-state actors.¹⁷³ Associating state control with offensive cyber operations is not impossible, however, and to date private cybersecurity firms have been able to find enough clues to make at least low- or medium-confidence assessments of state responsibility. In 2013, Mandiant felt confident enough to attach blame to a Chinese military unit for numerous attacks on U.S. corporations, organizations, and government agencies.¹⁷⁴ And FireEye has compiled enough evidence to confidently connect a threat it refers to as “APT37,” or “Reaper,” with the North Korean state.¹⁷⁵ While this is an area where traditional intelligence capabilities will still be critical to attribution investigations, the Consortium’s work can help bolster claims of state responsibility made by states based on classified evidence, even if the Consortium’s findings are less conclusive than evidence the victim state might possess.\nPerhaps the most significant challenge facing the Consortium is the ostensibly low likelihood that competing tech companies would come together to participate in the organization. But there are reasons to think that prominent players in the tech sector would be more interested than some might suppose. The most public example is Microsoft President and Chief Legal Officer Brad Smith’s campaign for a new “Digital Geneva Convention,” which he brought to the United\n¹⁷³ See Payne &amp; Finlay, supra note 5, at 562.\n¹⁷⁴ David Sanger et al., Chinese Army Unit is Seen as Tied to Hacking Against U.S., N.Y.

The tech sector plays a unique role as the internet's first responders, and we therefore should commit ourselves to collective action that will make the internet a safer place, affirming a role as a neutral Digital Switzerland that assists customers everywhere and retains the world's trust.¹⁷⁸\nSmith has gone to great lengths in an attempt to operationalize this principle, by leading the campaign to sign on more than thirty tech firms to the “Cybersecurity Tech Accord,” including Cisco, Dell, Facebook, FireEye, HP, Symantec, and Oracle.¹⁷⁹ The accord’s principles commit the signatories to supporting civil society, governments, and international organizations in advancing and building cybersecurity capacity to protect against offensive cyber operations, among other goals that would align with the driving principles behind organizing the Consortium.¹⁸⁰ While the accord is still young, its existence is a helpful indication of the tech sector’s thinking on these issues, and it suggests that the possibility of an investigative body like the Consortium is more greater than it appears on its face.\n¹⁷⁶ Brad Smith Takes His Call for a Digital Geneva Convention to the United Nations, Microsoft: Microsoft On the Issues (Nov. 7, 2017), https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2017/11/09/brad-smith-takes-call-digital-geneva-convention-united-nations/.\n¹⁷⁷ Sam Meredith, Microsoft Calls for ‘New Digital Geneva Convention’ after Spate of High-Profile Cyberattacks, CNBC (Jan. 26, 2018), https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/26/microsoft-calls-for-new-digital-geneva-convention-after-spate-of-high-profile-cyberattacks.html\n¹⁷⁸ Brad Smith, The Need for a Digital Geneva Convention, Microsoft: Microsoft on the Issues (Feb. 14, 2017), https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2017/02/14/need-digital-geneva-convention/#sm.0001hkfw5aob5evwum620jqwsabzv.\n¹⁷⁹ David Sanger, Tech Firms Sign “Digital Geneva Accord” Not to Aid Governments in Cyberwar, N.Y.

While multilateral treaties and international cooperation might be the preferred avenue to overcome them, current trends provide little hope for the success of such options. Despite this, the development of customary international law provides an opportunity to push forward in regulating state behavior surrounding cyberspace. This Note demonstrates how an attributional body like the Consortium stands to provide substantial benefit to the development of these norms by providing states with a transparent and independent mechanism upon which to build evidentiary standards, such as the sliding-scale evidentiary framework, to undergird countermeasures and acts of self-defense. In this way, the international community can make more consistent judgments about state action in response to offensive cyber operations. While this may provide less flexibility for states to act in the face of such operations than what is nearly guaranteed through today's system of opaque unilateral evidentiary assessments, such restrictions on state behavior would benefit the international community at large by increasing global stability. Further, adopting this Note's version of a sliding-scale approach to the standard of proof—one where the standard fluctuates based on the response a victim wishes to undertake—should accommodate the flexibility states need when attempting to respond to quickly to a cyber attack.\nBy offering both victim states and the accused the opportunity to obtain an independent, sophisticated, and quantifiable attributional assessment, a body like the Consortium could help alleviate the deterrence difficulties inherent in a low-confidence attribution landscape and reduce the risk that states escalate or begin conflicts with parties that have no relation to the conflict. Questions persist regarding sources of funding for the Consortium, its operational efficiency in light of the need for quick responses to severe offensive operations, and the remaining difficulty\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202\nLefebvre\nCracking Attribution\n46\nof connecting cyber operators to state direction and control. But they are by no means insurmountable.\nWhatever the case, the world will not stand still in the cyber landscape. If international law is to be of any value in restricting dangerous state behavior in this arena, its development must push forward. States can still do their part to gradually advance international norms by responsibly conducting their own cyber practices and related behavior in an effort to shape customary international law. An independent non-governmental attributional body like the Consortium provides a powerful launchpad for them to do just that.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202",
  "flat_text": "# CRACKING ATTRIBUTION: MOVING INTERNATIONAL NORMS FORWARD\nJoshua Lefebvre\nThis Note addresses how international law can meet the challenge of reliably and transparently identifying the actor responsible for a cyber attack, a feature of the cyber landscape referred to as the “attribution problem.” It examines the potential for customary international law to define evidentiary standards for evaluating claims of a cyber attacker’s identity, standards which would have to be met before a state victim could retaliate. Such a framework would replace the malleable and opaque ad hoc determinations of responsibility that states currently undertake in both the conventional force and the cyber contexts alike. To this end, this Note introduces a sliding-scale evidentiary standard that adapts to the—often limited—availability of evidence and short amount of time a victim might have to respond to cyber attacks.\nThis Note analogizes to attribution problems faced by the international community in the past, such as piracy and privateering on the eighteenth century’s high seas, to demonstrate that the legal problems posed by cyber capabilities are not unfamiliar. But the ubiquity of cyber capabilities and diffuse nature of the cyber landscape mean that the solution must be different. This Note demonstrates that a newly proposed non-governmental attribution body, structured like a tribunal, could meet the tremendous need many victims face in gathering the evidence to overcome the attribution problem inherent to cyberspace. Such a body, this Note argues, provides the best launchpad for developing the international norms—and, eventually, the customary international law—needed to build evidentiary standards in the cyber context.\nINTRODUCTION ... 1\nI.

Treaties dealing directly with cyber operations are scarce in number and limited in scope. State cyber practices are held close to the chest and, although their publicly available expressions are increasing, there are still too few to constitute well-defined norms to develop comprehensive customary international law. While it at least seems clear today that existing principles of international law apply in cyberspace, states—perhaps as a result of their own strategic caution—have, at present, left to the academy and non-governmental bodies much of the task of determining how such principles apply. Against this hazy legal backdrop, states and non-state actors alike have wasted no time in deploying cyber attacks and exploitations of ever more destructive and exploitative power. In June 2017, according to the U.S. government, the Russian military launched “the most destructive and costly cyber attack in history,” using ransomware dubbed “NotPetya” to cause billions of dollars in damage across Europe, the Americas, and Asia. Just two months later, in August 2017, a petrochemical plant in Saudi Arabia suffered a cyber attack that was designed to trigger an explosion that likely\n Introduction to International Governmental Group of Experts, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations 3 (Michael N.

Most notably, the first and second Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations, written by the International Group of Experts (“IGE”), have proven to be influential in detailing how international principles apply to cyberspace and, in particular, their application to cyber warfare. But even where consensus can be built around which principles of international law apply to cyberspace, a key roadblock remains toward much of their implementation. Namely, the application of state responsibility principles remains difficult—if not impossible—where victims cannot reliably and transparently identify the actor responsible or, worse, if the attacker’s identity remains unknown.

It then explores the evidentiary framework by which attribution claims in both the conventional and cyber context are measured. In doing so, it attempts to identify and help fill the gap in the academic literature surrounding what standards of proof are and should be expected to be met under international law. Toward this end, it introduces a novel application of a sliding scale of proof, one tied to the severity of the victim’s response rather than solely to the underlying breach of international law. Part I then concludes by providing a brief overview of how principles of state responsibility apply in cyberspace.\nPart II identifies a number of the proposed solutions to the attribution problem suggested in the literature—such as intergovernmental inspection and compliance bodies as well as multilateral treaties—and explains why they are inadequate in the cyber context or are unlikely to come about. It then critiques and builds upon the solution highlighted by this Note: a non-governmental global consortium of representatives from private companies, academia, and think tanks that assesses available forensic evidence to provide an attributional assessment for victims of cyber attack or exploitation. But the value of this organization does not just lie in its ability to provide a much-needed leader for neutral and capable technical investigations. Rather, it has significant potential to lay the groundwork for the proposed sliding-scale evidentiary framework’s\n See Waxman, supra note 4, at 426.\n While this Note recognizes the benefits of solutions that propose an intergovernmental organization to govern cyber capability use and compliance, akin to the International Atomic Energy Agency (“IAEA”), see, e.g., Scott Charney et al., Microsoft Corp., From Articulation to Implementation: Enabling Progress on Cybersecurity Norms 11 (2016), it also recognizes that states are highly unlikely in today’s toxic geopolitical environment to agree to allow representatives from foreign governments to inspect some of their most closely held secrets. Further, significant doubts might arise as to the neutrality of governmental representatives serving in the body’s management and operational roles, risking the legitimacy and independence of the body’s assessments.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202\nLefebvre\nCracking Attribution\n\nRather than have states judge for themselves how much proof is necessary to respond to an attack, this Note argues that states might feel obligated to justify their actions in the face of a quantifiable confidence metric, one that could be provided by the proposed non-governmental attribution body. Through reference to the attributional assessment of a neutral and sophisticated body, a state's self-defense and countermeasure activities could rest on a firmer and more transparent evidentiary foundation. In this way, this Note makes the novel suggestion that this non-governmental organization could serve as the best launchpad for developing customary international law to build evidentiary standards in the cyber context.\n## I. DEFINING THE ATTRIBUTION PROBLEM AND ITS SCOPE\nThe attribution problem is often viewed as a technical challenge with a technical solution: the tools of offensive cyber operations make it easy to hide one's identity from a victim, so would-be victims need to build cyber defensive capabilities and cyber forensic investigative capabilities to overcome this challenge. But the limitations of cyber defensive and investigative capabilities can and do pose obstacles to the application of international law. Principally, they foreground the question of how a state could respond lawfully under international law if it does not know against whom it should respond. The immensity of this problem, however, overshadows the subsequent\n See infra note 78 and accompanying text.\n This Note keys the term “self-defense” to its meaning under Article 51 of the U.N. Charter, limiting it to a victim state’s uses of force taken against an aggressor state in response to an armed attack. U.N. Charter, art. 51.\n In this Note, the term “countermeasures” is used as a term of art. It refers to actions taken by a victim state that amount to a breach of its international obligations vis-à-vis an aggressor state. Such actions must be taken with the goal of bringing the aggressor state back into compliance with its international obligations vis-à-vis the victim state and cannot exceed what is necessary and proportionate to effectuate that goal. Without the preceding act of aggression, these actions would otherwise be considered unlawful. Int’l. L. Comm’n, Rep. on the Work of its Fifty-Third Session, U.N. Doc. A/56/10, at 128–31 (2001).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202\nLefebvre\nCracking Attribution\n\nThis Part addresses both of these obstacles. It demonstrates why reliable, standardized, and transparent determinations of a cyber attacker’s identity—referred to throughout this Note as “attributional assessments” or “attributional claims”—are necessary to the successful application of international law’s principles to cyberspace, and it evaluates how customary international law could be developed to meet this end. Toward this effort, Section I.C addresses a relative gap in the literature by assessing what standard of proof is and should be necessary when making an attributional claim.\nFor the purposes of this Note, “attribution” is tied to identity, rather than an action’s particular cause. In this context, attribution refers to the process of determining the “identity or location of an attacker or an attacker’s intermediary.” To qualify as an interstate attributional claim, the identity of the attack or exploitation’s independent operators must be connected with customary international law’s principles of state responsibility, largely reflected in the second Tallinn Manual and discussed in Section I.D. Ultimately, once the technical assessment of the\n Waxman, supra note 4, at 426 (“[T]he low visibility of states’ moves and countermoves in cyberspace will slow the process of interpretive development . . . .

Conventional Parallels\nThe difficulty in linking attacks to the identity of the attacker is not a new problem for international law: states have struggled with making such determinations for centuries. This is true where another state has been the attacker, where a non-state actor acting under its own direction has been the attacker, and where state proxies acting under the direction of a sponsoring state have been the source of the attacks. Some commentators have drawn parallels between today’s challenges in policing cyberspace to those created by the state use of privateers on the high seas in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Florian Egloff notes how both the high seas through that period and cyberspace involve a range of actors, each with varying degrees of direction and control from a sponsoring state. Between these two different eras and environments, the parallels between state actors, semi-state actors, and non-state actors can be readily drawn: respectively, consider the similarities between formal navies and cyber military units, privateers and today’s “patriotic hackers,” or even pirates and most modern cybercriminals or cybercrime organizations.\n See infra note 66.\n Florian Egloff, Cybersecurity and the Age of Privateering, in Understanding Cyber Conflict: 14 Analogies 231, (George Perkovich &amp; Ariel E.

Charter’s prohibition on the use of force. This came about in large part from the transition from conventional war-making to “unconventional [and] low-intensity conflict [that] featured inconclusive evidence of foreign involvement or hostile action, and foreign state antagonists [who] worked to mask, conceal, or obscure their participation and responses.” As with today’s cyber attacks and exploitations, “once\n Carl J.

The parallels, however, highlight the international legal problems posed when the identity of an attacker is uncertain. While technical attribution capabilities are increasing for many states, including the United States, the identification of the machine or machines used in carrying out the attack, their operators, or even the geographic locations of the machines and their operators is not always enough when making a determination of state responsibility. Yet the stakes are high. If the injured state responds to a wrongful act under international law with a countermeasure aimed at a wrongly accused state, then the injured state has then committed an internationally wrongful act by engaging in countermeasures against an innocent state. Simply put, the international legal framework currently in place for responding to uses of force, armed attacks, and other breaches of international obligations cannot function properly without reliable attributional assessments, regardless of whether the unlawful action occurs in the context of a cyber or a traditional physical operation.\n Id.\n See Banks, supra note 2, at 1493 (describing some of the technical challenges posed by cyber attacks and exploitations).\n Banks, supra note 2, at 1502. Even fairly unsophisticated attackers are able to route their offensive cyber operations through a network of machines owned and operated by innocent bystanders, traveling national borders with the ease of an email.

These two components comprise factual inquiries, of course, into what machines were used to carry out an attack, who operated them, and who directed or controlled those operators for purposes of the operation.\nAt the most basic level, an offensive cyber operation involves one or more individuals, often acting remotely, who interfaces with one or more computers or entire networks—usually by means of programming code—in order to gain access to the targeted systems through hardware or software security vulnerabilities or through fraudulent credentials. Once the operation’s conductors have gained access to the desired system, they attempt to take advantage of the system to plant code, known as malware, that will destroy or degrade the intruded system, exfiltrate information from the system, or both.\nCyber operations pose significant and unique challenges in the evidentiary context as it relates to both the identity of the operator and attribution to a state. This is in part because the operations are “opaque to public view, technically very complex and likely to emerge piecemeal,” unlike conventional kinetic attacks, which are visible and “can be and often are broadcast widely, immediately, and understandably [and, further, the] common experience [of such attacks] makes\n See Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua (Nicar. v.

For example, in 2015, the French-language television network TV5Monde saw its networks attacked by an organization that made references to a “Cyber Caliphate” and “Je suis IS,” leading to an initial attribution to Islamic State. After further investigation, however, the attack appeared to be a false flag: FireEye and the National Cybersecurity Agency of France found leads that traced back to a highly sophisticated Russian group labelled by cybersecurity firms as, among other names, “Advanced Persistent Threat 28,” “Fancy Bear,” and “Sofacy.” The group is believed to have ties to the Russian government and is considered to have played a role in the cyber operation against the Democratic National Committee in 2016 and against the German Bundestag in 2015.\n1.

States often meet the shortcomings of forensic technical analysis with signals intelligence (\"SIGINT\") and human intelligence (\"HUMINT\") resources. In the case of SIGINT, this includes methods such as collection of the content or metadata from phone records, emails, and other communications. HUMINT includes sources such as interviews with recruited foreign agents. Despite the private sector's incredible technical forensics capabilities—which can rival that of states in terms of its technical capacity to identify offensive cyber operators—some of these more traditional sources of intelligence are unavailable to even the most sophisticated cybersecurity firms. While Symantec, Kaspersky, FireEye, CrowdStrike, and others may have an incredible talent pool and significant financial resources, they do not \"control the wires\" nor can they deploy on-the-ground espionage operations to develop critical intelligence to help implicate responsible states or better ascertain the identities of operators.\nBut even those states that are able to meet the factual challenge of identifying an attacker with a high degree of confidence are often unwilling to release much of the evidence on which\n See supra notes 49–55 and accompanying text (discussing the offensive cyber operation against TV5Monde).\n See Cyber Warfare in the 21st Century: Threats, Challenges, and Opportunities: Hearing Before the H.

Is There an Attribution Standard for Cyberspace Under International Law?\nIn the cyber context, the answers to the evidentiary questions are even more underdeveloped due to the paucity of transparent state practice and *opinio juris*—a term that refers to a state’s sense of legal obligation—in making public attributional statements for offensive cyber operations. In its 2015 report, the U.N. Group of Governmental Experts acknowledged that attribution claims for cyber operations “should be substantiated.” But the report failed to articulate how much or what type of evidence is necessary for states to justify countermeasures or acts of self-defense under international law, or even whether such claims must be substantiated publicly. The United States has gone one step further in articulating its position on the matter in remarks made in November 2016 by then-U.S. Department of State Legal Adviser Brian Egan:\n See Tallinn Manual 2.0, supra note 1, at 83.

The commentary accompanying the Draft Articles on State Responsibility notes:\nIn a bilateral dispute over State responsibility, the onus of establishing responsibility lies in principle on the claimant State. Where conduct in conflict with an international obligation is attributable to a State and that State seeks to avoid its responsibility by relying on a circumstance under chapter V [which describes circumstances precluding wrongfulness], however, the position changes and the onus lies on that State to justify or excuse its conduct.\nThis is echoed in the ICJ’s judgment in the *Oil Platforms* case. In that case, the ICJ indicated that the United States bore the burden of proving that Iranian forces fired a missile at the *Sea Isle City*, a Kuwaiti tanker reflagged to the United States, which had made a defensive claim for which it used this evidence as the factual basis.\n Banks, supra note 2, at 1507; see Cyber Warfare in the 21st Century: Threats, Challenges, and Opportunities: Hearing Before the H.

Nor does it seem that states carry a well-defined burden under international law related to the quality or amount of evidence used in proving an attributional claim before undertaking acts of self-defense or countermeasures against the accused state. Further, strikingly few commentators have even addressed the issue of evidentiary burdens under international law. But despite the IGE’s findings and the claims that states like the United States have made about (non-)obligations under international law, there is a contingent of those few who have argued the contrary. Such commentators claim that sufficient state practice exists to locate the standard of proof required of attribution claims.\nProfessor Mary Ellen O’Connell has argued that, at least in situations in which states are justifying the use of force under Article 51’s self-defense provision, state practice and the decisions of international courts and tribunals support a “clear and convincing” standard in evaluating evidence. She claims that “the international authority for the standard consists of several\n See also Banks, supra note 2, at 1499 (“Applying the Rules on State Responsibility and attribution compiled in Tallinn 2.0, there is no burden of proof or requirement that there exists definitive information on attribution.

State practice on its own is insufficient to establish customary international law; it is only when it is done out of a sense of legal obligation, or *opinio juris*, that it can be considered customary international law. Further, the fact that she only cites U.S. practice draws into question whether one state’s practice is enough, even if the United States were acting out of a sense of legal obligation. Lastly, the United States and any number of other states have a multitude of political reasons to indicate that they are in possession of “clear” or “convincing” evidence. There is no suggestion that such states believe that this is an evidentiary floor that must be met under international law before they can act on the evidence in their possession.\n O’Connell, supra note 31, at 23–28.\n But see Mark Landler &amp; Michael R.

Indeed, the ICJ’s proceedings only require enough proof to “satisfy” the ICJ in law and in fact, a rather flexible standard. Conceivably, as the ICJ suggested in its decision in the Nicaragua case, the ICJ may find itself satisfied with applying different standards of proof in different contexts, depending on the amount of evidence available or the difficulty in proving particular claims. This makes it even more difficult to make an inference about the standard it is using to judge the facts before it. Particularly since there is little state practice and no apparent opinio juris to support a standard of proof for state attribution claims against other states for a breach of an international obligation, any inferences about the standard of proof used by the ICJ appear to be cabined to that international body. This only becomes clearer when one considers that the ICJ derives its power to set a standard of proof from its foundational statute. It is not derived from principles of customary international law or some other species of international law that has broad impact\n Case Concerning Oil Platforms (Islamic Republic of Iran v.

The Value of a Sliding-Scale Attribution Standard\nThe absence of a standard of proof in these matters may be surprising, but it is likely—at least in part—a reflection of the reluctance among nations to share closely guarded intelligence methods on a global stage in front of ally and adversary alike. There is little doubt, however, that developing international norms to establish a standard of proof for attributional claims before undertaking countermeasures or self-defense measures would force states to exercise restraint in using these tools. One would hope that such restraint could help prevent conflicts from escalating or even spilling over into wrongly accused states that had no previous role in a particular conflict. Problems arise, though, in determining how high such a standard should be for cyber operations, given the difficulty many states face in being able to make an attributional claim with a high degree of confidence in a short amount of time. Any standard of proof employed should be sufficiently flexible to allow a state to act quickly enough for its countermeasures to serve as an adequate means of forcing the offending state back into compliance with its international\n See Statute of the International Court of Justice, June 26, 1945, art. 53(2), 59 Stat. 1055, 1062, T.S. No. 993.\n The reluctance, of course, is not unfounded. Sharing intelligence with adversaries can better clue them into the methods of the victim state’s intelligence collection, helping adversaries to better identify their own security vulnerabilities. For one example of how providing intelligence can change an adversary’s behavior in a way that threatens a state’s national security, see Eric Schmitt &amp; Michael S. Schmidt, *Queda Plot Leak Has Undermined U.S. Intelligence*, N.Y. Times (Sept. 29, 2013), https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/30/us/qaeda-plot-leak-has-undermined-us-intelligence.html (describing how after an intelligence leak, analysis have detected a sharp drop in terrorists’ use of a major communications channel that had been monitored by U.S. officials).\n U.N. Secretary-General, *Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security*, 16, U.N. Doc. A/66/152 (July 15, 2011) (reply received from the United States) (“The lack of timely, high-confidence attribution and the possibility of ‘spoofing’ can create uncertainty and confusion for Governments, thus increasing the potential for crisis instability, misdirected responses and loss of escalation control during major cyberincidents.”).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202\nLefebvre\nCracking Attribution\n\nA standard of proof tied to the anticipated severity of the victim state’s response rather than to the severity of the underlying breach might meet the goals of timely response while adapting to the lower quality and quantity of evidence available to the victim state shortly after suffering an offensive cyber operation. For example, the victim state might only need to find on the balance of evidence that a particular state is responsible for an offensive cyber operation if deploying countermeasures, such as the violation of a treaty between the victim and aggressor states, but it may need clear-and-convincing evidence to respond with a use of armed force. This proposal falls in line with the second Tallinn Manual’s suggestion that “the greater the underlying breach . . . the greater the confidence ought to be in the evidence relied upon by a State considering a response” since the “robustness of permissible self-help responses grows commensurately with the seriousness of the breach.” For example, a state should be more confident in its attribution when it responds with armed force to a cyber attack on an air traffic control system that resulted in aircraft accidents and fatalities. The same should be expected if it were to suffer an attack on the underground pump controllers for an underground rail system that resulted in major flooding and destruction of its infrastructure. If a state were to suffer a denial of service attack on the website of a regulatory agency that issues permits for hunting and fishing, however, principles of necessity and proportionality dictate that the victim state would only be permitted to respond with something\n Professors Christian Payne and Lorraine Finlay have proposed a standard of proof tied to the victim’s response, but they have failed to provide much detail other than suggesting victim states that “pursue peaceful, legal processes” for resolving disputes related to cyber operations should “have the benefit of eschewing stringent attribution tests normally required.” Payne &amp; Finlay, supra note 5, at 567. In such cases, they suggest strict liability for those states that the victim state believes to be the host states for the attack. Id. at 566–67. They do not discuss the standard of proof necessary to undertake countermeasures and argue that the “effective control” standard is required for self-defense measures. Id.; see also infra note 132 and accompanying text (discussing the “effective control” standard).\n Tallinn Manual 2.0, supra note 1, at 82 (citing Oil Platforms, 2003 I.C.J. at ¶ 67 (separate opinion of Judge Higgins)).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202\nLefebvre\nCracking Attribution\n\nUnder a shifting standard of proof for attributional claims, a state could respond to the first two examples with countermeasures if it perhaps only had probable cause that a given state had conducted the attacks. After acquiring evidence to prove its attributional claim at a higher standard of proof, such as clear-and-convincing evidence, a state could respond with armed force if it were to conclude that such force would be proportional and necessary to repel the attack or later attacks. This shifting standard of proof does not change the ultimate severity ceiling of the response available to the victim state, which is still tied to the underlying breach and governed by principles of proportionality and necessity; rather, it adapts the severity of the response to the standard of proof that the victim state is able to meet at any given point. This would allow victim states to respond—at least in some fashion—more quickly, and thereby more effectively, to offensive cyber operations than if a higher evidentiary threshold were required uniformly among all types of responses. Victim states, of course, could still increase the severity of their responses as needed to force the attacking state back into compliance with its international obligations, so long as the certainty in the attacker’s identity correspondingly increased.\nAdmittedly, such a standard might result in more severe and more frequent state responses against less sophisticated actors—who lack the ability to hide the evidence that leads to their identity—than sophisticated actors. But this is no different than any other system that requires evidentiary burdens to be met before responsive measures can be taken: even in domestic criminal\n See infra note 113.\n International Governmental Group of Experts, Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare 61 (Michael N. Schmitt ed., 2013).\n While outside the scope of this Note, there is no reason why such a standard could not be tied to any use of force, whether it be conventional or cyber. Indeed, there is a colorable argument that it would be wise to apply such a standard beyond the cyber context, particularly given the ad hoc factual evaluation of conventional use of force events and their associated attribution problems.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202\nLefebvre\nCracking Attribution\n\nPart II further explores how evaluations of such evidence could be more publicly accountable by allowing states to submit their claims to a neutral body that would provide an attributional assessment of the offensive cyber operation, including a forensic report and a confidence judgment as to the culprit. It also examines how such a body could contribute to the creation of international norms—and, eventually, customary international law—that integrate this sliding-scale evidentiary framework and which make it clear what standard of proof a state should have to meet before responding with the use of force or countermeasures. In this way, the body could create a platform through which states could better define customary international law, even where attempts to build positive international law have stalled or failed.^[115]^\n## D. Frameworks for Assessing State Responsibility for Cyber Operations\nIn contrast with standards of proof, principles of state responsibility are far better defined under international law, thanks to the ICJ's jurisprudence and the International Law Commission's (\"ILC\") Articles on State Responsibility. As a result, the second Tallinn Manual provides far more guidance about principles of state responsibility as they relate to cyber operations, beginning with Tallinn Rule 14's threshold^[116]^: \"A State bears international responsibility for a cyber-related act\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202\nLefebvre\nCracking Attribution\n\n Tallinn Manual 2.0, supra note 1, at 84. The language “breach of an international legal obligation” is particularly important, since it does not include activities that are either unregulated by international law, such as cyber espionage and related intelligence gathering, or are expressly permitted, such as suspension of international cyber communication services within its territory.

Despite differences in what evidence is required, the evidentiary standard remains the same for each. Thus, in order to reach an attribution conclusion, the analysis developed in the previous Section should be applied not just to factual determinations that lead to the identities of individual cyber operators, but to factual determinations that lead to conclusions about state responsibility.\n## II.

Given the United States’ role in the international community and its strength in the cyber landscape, there is little hope of building a productive multilateral agreement without its support. But the United States’ preferred path forward has encountered its own roadblocks after the collapse of consensus among the U.N. Group of Governmental Experts on Information Security, a multilateral attempt to more firmly establish customary international law in the cyber context.\nSome, most notably Microsoft Corporation, the Atlantic Council, and the RAND Corporation, have called for the creation of an attributional organization that would investigate offensive cyber operations and provide assessments on the identity of the likely culprit or culprits. Microsoft and the Atlantic Council have suggested that the body be built as an intergovernmental compliance and attribution body akin to the International Atomic Energy Agency (“IAEA”) or the\n International Cybersecurity Strategy: Deterring Foreign Threats and Building Global Cyber Norms: Hearing Before the Subcomm.

This is in part because the United States takes an “effects” view the term “cyber weapon,” rather than seeing them as a class of tools that are identifiable as weapons in and of themselves. That is to say, the United States considers a cyber tool a weapon based on the effects of its use rather than based on the nature of its architecture.

Building a Private Body for a Public Good\nIn 2017, researchers at the RAND Corporation published a white paper proposing the creation of an attributional organization that would exclude states from its management and operation, referring to the proposed body as the “Global Cyber Attribution Consortium” (“the Consortium”). Instead of states, RAND proposes that the body be managed and operated by cyberspace legal and policy experts, international policy experts from academia and research organizations, and technical experts from academia as well as cybersecurity and information technology companies. RAND recognizes that these actors are not immune to politicization: they may face pressures from their home markets or states of incorporation, or they may inherently possess strong national loyalties. But such a body would at least be further removed from state political interests and face more political accountability at the international level, to the extent that the companies and research organizations involved conduct global operations. Most\n Davis et al., RAND Corp., supra note 51, at 31; see Efrony, supra note 133 (“None of the experts should be simultaneously employed by governmental institutions to avoid even the appearance of conflicts of interest.”).\n Davis et al., RAND Corp., supra note 51, at 31.\n Id at 27, 33. To be clear, by using the term “attribution organization,” the suggestion is that the organization engages exclusively in attributional assessments. Unlike the proposals suggested by Microsoft and the Atlantic Council, it has no enforcement function. See Charney, Microsoft Corp., supra note 12, at 11; Jason Healey, et al., Atlantic Council, Confidence-Building Measures in Cyberspace: A Multistakeholder Approach for Stability and Security 10 (2014).\n Davis et al., RAND Corp., supra note 51, at 29; see also Efrony, supra note 133 (supporting the idea of excluding states from a global attribution body).\n Admittedly, “global operations” does not mean such operations will be equal among all states. One might argue that states with more sophisticated technology sectors could have more influence over the Consortium than states with less sophisticated technology sectors, since such countries will likely have stronger ties to members of the Consortium. But given the wide network of global interests and partnerships that states with sophisticated technology sectors have, which often tie them to states with smaller technology sectors, it is unlikely that the Consortium could or would privilege states along this line. Consider, for example, Russia’s collaborative interests with Iran, or the United States’ strong relationship with Afghanistan. Given this, the more relevant distinction may be between those states with friends and those without.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202\nLefebvre\nCracking Attribution\n\nJust being further removed from the risk of politicization, however, is not enough. The nature of the organization’s work requires not only a better reputation for neutrality than what could be accomplished with an intergovernmental organization, but an incredibly strong reputation for neutrality and expertise. This would, at a minimum, require geographic diversity from each of the sectors represented and strict transparency in both its governance and evaluation methodologies and procedures. As RAND puts it, with no international norms to rely upon at present, the Consortium can only derive its legitimacy over time from “the reputation and credibility gained from the technical expertise of its diverse global membership and its commitment to objectivity and transparency in its attribution findings.”\nTo deliver on the promise of providing more reliable and transparent attributional assessments than what states have offered to date, the Consortium would need to include formalized conditions that trigger its review, standardized processes for evidence collection and assessment, attribution-confidence standards, procedures for notification and publication of results, and standardized procedures to assess the severity and sophistication of offensive operations. Indeed, standardization and transparency are two crucial elements missing from the current diffuse attribution regime. As discussed, because of the lack of clear evidentiary standards, states at present have little incentive to be transparent in their technical analysis.

While the Consortium would only begin an investigation at the request of the victim, the question remains, at least in some cases, as to which victim would have the proper standing to file a request with the Consortium. For example, if an electrical utility suffers an attack on its infrastructure, does the state retain exclusive rights to trigger the investigation and publicize the results or should the utility company have the ability to file an investigation request? RAND suggests leaving such decisions up to the discretion of the Consortium. But granting a private entity standing to bring an investigation request makes little sense, particularly given the consequences for the victim state if the operation were publicized and a state or non-state actor were accused. At the time of the request’s filing, there may be little clue as to the identity of the attacker. The risks of giving a private entity the right to publicize attacks and accuse another state with the Consortium’s platform and credibility behind its claim could cause significant difficulties for states in planning and conducting their international relations. While private entities may be hesitant to report attacks to their host states—particularly if they might be liable in some way for the intrusion—these concerns make it more prudent to favor giving states exclusive standing to bring the claim and to publicize the results.\n Id. at 39.\n Id.\n Id. at 36.\n Id.\n This concern resembles those that some have been expressed about claims made under the Alien Tort Statute and their potential to interfere with the foreign affairs of the United States. See Gary Clyde Hufbauer &amp; Nicholas K. Mitrokostas, Awakening Monster: The Alien Tort Statute of 1789 14 (2003); Robert Knowles, A Realist Defense of the Alien Tort Statute, 88 Wash. U. L.

One state killing the nationals of another state would, at the very least, be activity “inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations.” U.N. Charter art. 2(4). Customary international law’s doctrine permitting the protection of nationals abroad seems to reflect that this is a sensible construction as does the principle of passive personality. See Restatement (Third) of the Foreign Relations Law of the U.S., § 402 cmt. g (Am. Law. Inst. 1987) (passive personality principle); Andrew W.R. Thomson, Doctrine of the Protection of Nationals Abroad: Rise of the Non-Combatant Evacuation Operation, 11 Wash. Univ. Global Studs. L. Rev. 627, 628–29 (2011) (protection of nationals abroad principle); see also 2 Vattel, The Law of Nations; or Principles of the Law of Nature; Applied to the Conduct and Affairs of Nations and Sovereigns § 71 (Joseph Chitty ed., Philadelphia, T.&amp;J.W. Johnson &amp; Co. 1872) (“Whoever uses a citizen ill, indirectly offends the State, which is bound; to protect this citizen; and the sovereign of the latter should avenge his wrongs, punish the aggressor, and, if possible, oblige him to make full reparation; since otherwise the citizen would not obtain the great end of the civil association, which is, safety.”).\n Tallinn Manual 2.0, supra note 1, at 340–41.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202\nLefebvre\nCracking Attribution\n\nAt least in what might be expected in the typical case, where it is clear which state has both standing to bring the request and the right to publicize results, the Consortium’s work functions similarly to a pretrial hearing in the United States, where the Consortium acts as both factfinder and judge. While this is yet another area that the RAND proposal does not discuss with much depth, it would be sensible for the Consortium to provide the accused state with an advance copy of the Consortium’s report and an opportunity to rebut its conclusion and aspects of forensic report. This stage of the investigation could provide victim states with an opportunity to supplement the technical report from the Consortium’s forensic investigation with evidence gained through the victim state’s intelligence capabilities, such as from SIGINT and HUMINT, perhaps presenting such information to the Consortium in camera. To the extent a victim state is unwilling to share its intelligence with the Consortium, the only cost would be a lower confidence level in the attribution assessment than the Consortium would otherwise be able to provide. Alternatively, the Consortium might be able to release its forensic report and confidence assessment of the identity of the individual operators but provide a no-confidence or low-confidence assessment of state responsibility. Such a report would, at the very least, be valuable if the victim state chose to indict the operators under its domestic criminal law.\n See, e.g., Press Release, U.S. Dep’t of Justice, North Korean Regime-Backed Programmer Charged with Conspiracy to Conduct Multiple Cyber Attacks and Intrusions (Sept. 6, 2018), https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/north-korean-regime-backed-programmer-charged-conspiracy-conduct-multiple-cyber-attacks-and.

Further, in the investigations it would accept, its technical capabilities could still help to fill the evidentiary gap that states face in justifying countermeasures or self-defense, especially where the victim state’s technical capabilities are lacking.\nTo the extent that states are able to point to an independent body’s declassified cyber forensic investigation, a state’s justification for countermeasures would be built on firmer factual ground than if it only had its classified intelligence to rely upon. With a reduced ability to hide behind a claim of pretextual or false accusation, states might exercise more caution in conducting offensive cyber operations or might restrict themselves to low-level uses of force so as not to draw attention of the Consortium. This is true whether or not key players in the international community choose to submit a case to the Consortium. One may expect that the United States, China, Israel, or Russia may at first feel more comfortable relying upon the technical sophistication of their own intelligence communities to reliably identify culprits and might reject opening up the process to an independent body. But unlike with the political backing needed in a multilateral treaty, the Consortium could still provide much-needed technical assistance to less sophisticated middle-power and developing states that are targets of cyber attacks and exploitations, without the\nConducting Coordinated Campaign of Cyber Attacks Against U.S. Financial Sector (March 24, 2016), https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/seven-iranians-working-islamic-revolutionary-guard-corps-affiliated-entities-charged; Press Release, U.S. Dep’t Justice, U.S. Charges Five Chinese Military Hackers for Cyber Espionage Against U.S. Corporations and a Labor Organization for Commercial Advantage, (May 19, 2014), https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/us-charges-five-chinese-military-hackers-cyber-espionage-against-us-corporations-and-labor.\n At least part of the blame for the difficulties of deterring offensive cyber operations lies with the challenges in reliably attributing the operations to the correct culprit.

By tracking how states choose to respond to cyber attacks or exploitations and connecting those responses to the confidence level provided in the Consortium’s assessment, one might find that international norms develop around the amount of proof necessary before states feel it is permissible to respond. Rather than have states act as their own judges of how much proof is necessary to respond to an attack, states might feel they are obligated to justify their actions in the face of a quantifiable confidence metric.\nStates might also choose to reference such assessments in their domestic prosecutions of the accused individuals. The United States, for example, has issued indictments against a number of foreign officials and others who use cyber operations to threaten U.S. national security. If other states had access to similar technical resources to attribute attacks with a high enough degree\n See U.N. Secretary-General, Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security 18, U.N. Doc.

Challenges Ahead\nDespite the promise an independent non-governmental attribution body like the Consortium holds for building international norms, challenges remain for the Consortium’s effective execution. If independence is a key feature, from what sources could it responsibly derive funding? How will such a body prioritize its investigations and how will it deliver results quickly enough to meet the need for timely response that victim states will face? Further, without traditional sources of intelligence at hand, how will such a body meet the need to connect an operator’s activity with state direction and control in the case of state-sponsored attacks?\nRAND suggests initial funding from philanthropic sources and the inclusion of a charter mandate to seek funding from the United Nations at a later point. RAND also points to the possibility of funding from cybersecurity and information technology companies that operate and defend much of the infrastructure upon which attacks are launched. This might not be so far-fetched: if the Consortium were able to build a strong reputation in the international community,\n Deeks, supra note 163.\n See supra note 115.\n Davis et al., RAND Corp., supra note 51, at 44.\n Id. at 45.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202\nLefebvre\nCracking Attribution\n\nIf it could be done transparently, this Note suggests another solution: the Consortium might even charge clients fees for attribution services, in accordance with their ability to pay, basing its schedule off of the United Nations’ scale of assessments for the apportionment of its expenses. Admittedly, this might introduce risks to its neutrality if the organization appears to demonstrate something akin to customer loyalty. If any attribution body were to accept fees for its services to offset its costs, its revenue streams would need to be diversified enough to prevent reliance on fees from any particular state, region, or global bloc.\nDeveloping prioritization policies may best be left to the discretion of the Consortium, given the variety of effects cyber attacks produce and the difficulty in organizing attacks by their severity. For example, the Consortium might be forced to choose between investigating a cyber attack that resulted in an explosion that killed tens of people or a ransomware attack that paralyzed the state’s ability to provide key services and cost its citizens and businesses hundreds of millions of dollars and maybe, indirectly, loss of life. In this case, one might suggest investigating the former first, since the victim state in that case would have suffered an armed attack under the effects test and would have the right to respond in self-defense, if such measures were necessary to prevent future attacks. However, one can imagine murkier cases where the severity might be tied to the degree of harm suffered by the victim. For example, two ostensibly different attacks on two different central bank accounts might result in the same amount of money lost, but one of\n Cf. G.A. Res. 70/245 (December 23, 2015) (detailing the U.N. scale of assessments).\n Cf. supra note 6–7 and accompanying text (detailing cyber attacks that either did or would have resulted in similar damage).\n Tallinn Manual 2.0, supra note 1, at 340–41.\n U.N. Charter, art. 51.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202\nLefebvre\nCracking Attribution\n\nEven if the Consortium were able to develop severity prioritization rules, the body might not be able to complete the investigation in a timely enough fashion for a state to respond. If a state continues to suffer armed attacks or uses of force, the victim might need to respond with self-defense measures under Article 51 or enact countermeasures in order to bring the culprit back into compliance with its international obligations. In such a situation, the Consortium might be able to release preliminary findings at a lower confidence level. Acting on any such findings could operate under a “buyer beware” framework, a concept that would tie nicely with the sliding-scale evidentiary framework proposed in Section I.C. Over time, international norms—and perhaps, eventually, customary international law—could be built around the level of confidence expected from attributional assessments before a state could pursue countermeasures, invoke pleas of necessity, or undertake acts of self-defense. The Consortium’s findings would make the adoption of this sliding-scale evidentiary framework more easily possible, since the findings would provide a quantifiable, standardized, and easily referenced confidence level for the international community to debate. Over time, this transparency could help develop international law’s standards of proof by providing more transparent examples of state practice, leading to easier identification of the *opinio juris* needed to locate customary international law. For example, one might find, after mapping the Consortium’s confidence levels of its attribution assessments to the corresponding state responses, that states are only willing to enact countermeasures on confidence levels of fifty percent or higher and self-defense measures on confidence levels of seventy-five percent or higher.\n See supra note 109–111 and accompanying text.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202\nLefebvre\nCracking Attribution\n\nPerhaps the most significant challenge facing the Consortium is the ostensibly low likelihood that competing tech companies would come together to participate in the organization. But there are reasons to think that prominent players in the tech sector would be more interested than some might suppose.

The tech sector plays a unique role as the internet's first responders, and we therefore should commit ourselves to collective action that will make the internet a safer place, affirming a role as a neutral Digital Switzerland that assists customers everywhere and retains the world's trust.\nSmith has gone to great lengths in an attempt to operationalize this principle, by leading the campaign to sign on more than thirty tech firms to the “Cybersecurity Tech Accord,” including Cisco, Dell, Facebook, FireEye, HP, Symantec, and Oracle. The accord’s principles commit the signatories to supporting civil society, governments, and international organizations in advancing and building cybersecurity capacity to protect against offensive cyber operations, among other goals that would align with the driving principles behind organizing the Consortium. While the accord is still young, its existence is a helpful indication of the tech sector’s thinking on these issues, and it suggests that the possibility of an investigative body like the Consortium is more greater than it appears on its face.\n Brad Smith Takes His Call for a Digital Geneva Convention to the United Nations, Microsoft: Microsoft On the Issues (Nov. 7, 2017), https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2017/11/09/brad-smith-takes-call-digital-geneva-convention-united-nations/.\n Sam Meredith, Microsoft Calls for ‘New Digital Geneva Convention’ after Spate of High-Profile Cyberattacks, CNBC (Jan. 26, 2018), https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/26/microsoft-calls-for-new-digital-geneva-convention-after-spate-of-high-profile-cyberattacks.html\n Brad Smith, The Need for a Digital Geneva Convention, Microsoft: Microsoft on the Issues (Feb. 14, 2017), https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2017/02/14/need-digital-geneva-convention/#sm.0001hkfw5aob5evwum620jqwsabzv.\n David Sanger, Tech Firms Sign “Digital Geneva Accord” Not to Aid Governments in Cyberwar, N.Y.

While multilateral treaties and international cooperation might be the preferred avenue to overcome them, current trends provide little hope for the success of such options. Despite this, the development of customary international law provides an opportunity to push forward in regulating state behavior surrounding cyberspace. This Note demonstrates how an attributional body like the Consortium stands to provide substantial benefit to the development of these norms by providing states with a transparent and independent mechanism upon which to build evidentiary standards, such as the sliding-scale evidentiary framework, to undergird countermeasures and acts of self-defense. In this way, the international community can make more consistent judgments about state action in response to offensive cyber operations. While this may provide less flexibility for states to act in the face of such operations than what is nearly guaranteed through today's system of opaque unilateral evidentiary assessments, such restrictions on state behavior would benefit the international community at large by increasing global stability. Further, adopting this Note's version of a sliding-scale approach to the standard of proof—one where the standard fluctuates based on the response a victim wishes to undertake—should accommodate the flexibility states need when attempting to respond to quickly to a cyber attack.\nBy offering both victim states and the accused the opportunity to obtain an independent, sophisticated, and quantifiable attributional assessment, a body like the Consortium could help alleviate the deterrence difficulties inherent in a low-confidence attribution landscape and reduce the risk that states escalate or begin conflicts with parties that have no relation to the conflict. Questions persist regarding sources of funding for the Consortium, its operational efficiency in light of the need for quick responses to severe offensive operations, and the remaining difficulty\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202\nLefebvre\nCracking Attribution\n\nWhatever the case, the world will not stand still in the cyber landscape. If international law is to be of any value in restricting dangerous state behavior in this arena, its development must push forward. States can still do their part to gradually advance international norms by responsibly conducting their own cyber practices and related behavior in an effort to shape customary international law. An independent non-governmental attributional body like the Consortium provides a powerful launchpad for them to do just that.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202",

Toward this effort, Section I.C addresses a relative gap in the literature by assessing what standard of proof is and should be necessary when making an attributional claim.\nFor the purposes of this Note, “attribution” is tied to identity, rather than an action’s particular cause. In this context, attribution refers to the process of determining the “identity or location of an attacker or an attacker’s intermediary.”¹⁷ To qualify as an interstate attributional claim, the identity of the attack or exploitation’s independent operators must be connected with customary international law’s principles of state responsibility, largely reflected in the second Tallinn Manual and discussed in Section I.D.¹⁸ Ultimately, once the technical assessment of the ¹⁶ Waxman, supra note 4, at 426 (“[T]he low visibility of states’ moves and countermoves in cyberspace will slow the process of interpretive development....

    "## A. Conventional Parallels": "The difficulty in linking attacks to the identity of the attacker is not a new problem for international law: states have struggled with making such determinations for centuries. This is true where another state has been the attacker, where a non-state actor acting under its own direction has been the attacker, and where state proxies acting under the direction of a sponsoring state have been the source of the attacks. Some commentators have drawn parallels between today’s challenges in policing cyberspace to those created by the state use of privateers on the high seas in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.²⁴ Florian Egloff notes how both the high seas through that period and cyberspace involve a range of actors, each with varying degrees of direction and control from a sponsoring state.²⁵ Between these two different eras and environments, the parallels between state actors, semi-state actors, and non-state actors can be readily drawn: respectively, consider the similarities between formal navies and cyber military units, privateers and today’s “patriotic hackers,”²⁶ or even pirates and most modern cybercriminals or cybercrime organizations.²⁷\n²³ See infra note 66.\n²⁴ Florian Egloff, Cybersecurity and the Age of Privateering, in Understanding Cyber Conflict: 14 Analogies 231, (George Perkovich &amp; Ariel E.

While technical attribution capabilities are increasing for many states, including the United States, the identification of the machine or machines used in carrying out the attack, their operators, or even the geographic locations of the machines and their operators is not always enough when making a determination of state responsibility.³⁶ Yet the stakes are high. If the injured state responds to a wrongful act under international law³⁷ with a countermeasure aimed at a wrongly accused state, then the injured state has then committed an internationally wrongful act by engaging in countermeasures against an innocent state.³⁸ Simply put, the international legal framework currently in place for responding to uses of force, armed attacks, and other breaches of international obligations cannot function properly without reliable attributional assessments, regardless of whether the unlawful action occurs in the context of a cyber or a traditional physical operation.³⁹ ³⁴ Id.\n³⁵ See Banks, supra note 2, at 1493 (describing some of the technical challenges posed by cyber attacks and exploitations).\n³⁶ Banks, supra note 2, at 1502.

Once the operation’s conductors have gained access to the desired system, they attempt to take advantage of the system to plant code, known as malware,⁴¹ that will destroy or degrade the intruded system, exfiltrate information from the system, or both.⁴² Cyber operations pose significant and unique challenges in the evidentiary context as it relates to both the identity of the operator and attribution to a state.

Group of Governmental Experts acknowledged that attribution claims for cyber operations “should be substantiated.” But the report failed to articulate how much or what type of evidence is necessary for states to justify countermeasures or acts of self-defense under international law, or even whether such claims must be substantiated publicly.⁷⁷ The United States has gone one step further in articulating its position on the matter in remarks made in November 2016 by then-U.S. Department of State Legal Adviser Brian Egan: ⁷⁶ See Tallinn Manual 2.0, supra note 1, at 83.

The commentary accompanying the Draft Articles on State Responsibility notes: In a bilateral dispute over State responsibility, the onus of establishing responsibility lies in principle on the claimant State. Where conduct in conflict with an international obligation is attributable to a State and that State seeks to avoid its responsibility by relying on a circumstance under chapter V [which describes circumstances precluding wrongfulness], however, the position changes and the onus lies on that State to justify or excuse its conduct.⁸⁵ This is echoed in the ICJ’s judgment in the *Oil Platforms* case.⁸⁶ In that case, the ICJ indicated that the United States bore the burden of proving that Iranian forces fired a missile at the *Sea Isle City*, a Kuwaiti tanker reflagged to the United States, which had made a defensive claim for which it used this evidence as the factual basis.⁸⁷ ⁸³ Banks, supra note 2, at 1507; see Cyber Warfare in the 21st Century: Threats, Challenges, and Opportunities: Hearing Before the H.

But despite the IGE’s findings and the claims that states like the United States have made about (non-)obligations under international law, there is a contingent of those few who have argued the contrary. Such commentators claim that sufficient state practice exists to locate the standard of proof required of attribution claims.⁹⁰ Professor Mary Ellen O’Connell has argued that, at least in situations in which states are justifying the use of force under Article 51’s self-defense provision, state practice and the decisions of international courts and tribunals support a “clear and convincing” standard in evaluating evidence.⁹¹ She claims that “the international authority for the standard consists of several ⁸⁸ See also Banks, supra note 2, at 1499 (“Applying the Rules on State Responsibility and attribution compiled in Tallinn 2.0, there is no burden of proof or requirement that there exists definitive information on attribution.

Professor O’Connell’s paper arguing that a clear-and-convincing has proven the most influential out of those few that argue in favor of its existence, and so my argument places the most emphasis on defusing the claim as she describes it.\n⁹¹ O’Connell, supra note 68, at 21–28; see Geiß &amp; Lahmann, Freedom and Security in Cyberspace: Shifting the Focus Away From Military Responses Towards Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention, in Peacetime Regime for State Activities in Cyberspace: International Law, International Relations and Diplomacy, supra note 90, at 624 (arguing that the “clear and convincing” standard was applied by the ICJ implicitly in the its decisions in the Nicaragua case, Oil Platforms case, and Armed Activities case).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202 Lefebvre Cracking Attribution First, while she cites examples of state practice of injured states using language indicating that they are in possession of “clear,” “compelling,” or “convincing” evidence of having suffered an internationally wrongful act at the hand of a particular state, there is no indication that this is done out of a sense of legal obligation.⁹³ State practice on its own is insufficient to establish customary international law; it is only when it is done out of a sense of legal obligation, or *opinio juris*, that it can be considered customary international law. Further, the fact that she only cites U.S. practice draws into question whether one state’s practice is enough, even if the United States were acting out of a sense of legal obligation. Lastly, the United States and any number of other states have a multitude of political reasons to indicate that they are in possession of “clear” or “convincing” evidence. There is no suggestion that such states believe that this is an evidentiary floor that must be met under international law before they can act on the evidence in their possession.\n⁹² O’Connell, supra note 31, at 23–28.\n⁹³ But see Mark Landler &amp; Michael R.

Indeed, the ICJ’s proceedings only require enough proof to “satisfy” the ICJ in law and in fact, a rather flexible standard.¹⁰³ Conceivably, as the ICJ suggested in its decision in the Nicaragua case, the ICJ may find itself satisfied with applying different standards of proof in different contexts, depending on the amount of evidence available or the difficulty in proving particular claims. This makes it even more difficult to make an inference about the standard it is using to judge the facts before it.¹⁰⁴ Particularly since there is little state practice and no apparent opinio juris to support a standard of proof for state attribution claims against other states for a breach of an international obligation,¹⁰⁵ any inferences about the standard of proof used by the ICJ appear to be cabined to that international body.¹⁰⁶ This only becomes clearer when one considers that the ICJ derives its power to set a standard of proof from its foundational statute.

    "## 3. The Value of a Sliding-Scale Attribution Standard": "The absence of a standard of proof in these matters may be surprising, but it is likely—at least in part—a reflection of the reluctance among nations to share closely guarded intelligence methods on a global stage in front of ally and adversary alike.¹⁰⁸ There is little doubt, however, that developing international norms to establish a standard of proof for attributional claims before undertaking countermeasures or self-defense measures would force states to exercise restraint in using these tools. One would hope that such restraint could help prevent conflicts from escalating or even spilling over into wrongly accused states that had no previous role in a particular conflict.¹⁰⁹ Problems arise, though, in determining how high such a standard should be for cyber operations, given the difficulty many states face in being able to make an attributional claim with a high degree of confidence in a short amount of time. Any standard of proof employed should be sufficiently flexible to allow a state to act quickly enough for its countermeasures to serve as an adequate means of forcing the offending state back into compliance with its international\n¹⁰⁷ See Statute of the International Court of Justice, June 26, 1945, art. 53(2), 59 Stat. 1055, 1062, T.S. No. 993.\n¹⁰⁸ The reluctance, of course, is not unfounded. Sharing intelligence with adversaries can better clue them into the methods of the victim state’s intelligence collection, helping adversaries to better identify their own security vulnerabilities. For one example of how providing intelligence can change an adversary’s behavior in a way that threatens a state’s national security, see Eric Schmitt &amp; Michael S. Schmidt, *Queda Plot Leak Has Undermined U.S. Intelligence*, N.Y. Times (Sept. 29, 2013), https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/30/us/qaeda-plot-leak-has-undermined-us-intelligence.html (describing how after an intelligence leak, analysis have detected a sharp drop in terrorists’ use of a major communications channel that had been monitored by U.S. officials).\n¹⁰⁹ U.N.

A/66/152 (July 15, 2011) (reply received from the United States) (“The lack of timely, high-confidence attribution and the possibility of ‘spoofing’ can create uncertainty and confusion for Governments, thus increasing the potential for crisis instability, misdirected responses and loss of escalation control during major cyberincidents.”).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202\nLefebvre\nCracking Attribution\nA standard of proof tied to the anticipated severity of the victim state’s response rather than to the severity of the underlying breach might meet the goals of timely response while adapting to the lower quality and quantity of evidence available to the victim state shortly after suffering an offensive cyber operation.¹¹⁰ For example, the victim state might only need to find on the balance of evidence that a particular state is responsible for an offensive cyber operation if deploying countermeasures, such as the violation of a treaty between the victim and aggressor states, but it may need clear-and-convincing evidence to respond with a use of armed force. This proposal falls in line with the second Tallinn Manual’s suggestion that “the greater the underlying breach... the greater the confidence ought to be in the evidence relied upon by a State considering a response” since the “robustness of permissible self-help responses grows commensurately with the seriousness of the breach.”¹¹¹ For example, a state should be more confident in its attribution when it responds with armed force to a cyber attack on an air traffic control system that resulted in aircraft accidents and fatalities. The same should be expected if it were to suffer an attack on the underground pump controllers for an underground rail system that resulted in major flooding and destruction of its infrastructure. If a state were to suffer a denial of service attack on the website of a regulatory agency that issues permits for hunting and fishing, however, principles of necessity and proportionality dictate that the victim state would only be permitted to respond with something ¹¹⁰ Professors Christian Payne and Lorraine Finlay have proposed a standard of proof tied to the victim’s response, but they have failed to provide much detail other than suggesting victim states that “pursue peaceful, legal processes” for resolving disputes related to cyber operations should “have the benefit of eschewing stringent attribution tests normally required.” Payne &amp; Finlay, supra note 5, at 567. In such cases, they suggest strict liability for those states that the victim state believes to be the host states for the attack. Id. at 566–67. They do not discuss the standard of proof necessary to undertake countermeasures and argue that the “effective control” standard is required for self-defense measures. Id.; see also infra note 132 and accompanying text (discussing the “effective control” standard).\n¹¹¹ Tallinn Manual 2.0, supra note 1, at 82 (citing Oil Platforms, 2003 I.C.J. at ¶ 67 (separate opinion of Judge Higgins)).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202 Lefebvre Cracking Attribution Under a shifting standard of proof for attributional claims, a state could respond to the first two examples with countermeasures if it perhaps only had probable cause that a given state had conducted the attacks. After acquiring evidence to prove its attributional claim at a higher standard of proof, such as clear-and-convincing evidence, a state could respond with armed force if it were to conclude that such force would be proportional and necessary to repel the attack or later attacks.¹¹³ This shifting standard of proof does not change the ultimate severity ceiling of the response available to the victim state, which is still tied to the underlying breach and governed by principles of proportionality and necessity; rather, it adapts the severity of the response to the standard of proof that the victim state is able to meet at any given point.¹¹⁴ This would allow victim states to respond—at least in some fashion—more quickly, and thereby more effectively, to offensive cyber operations than if a higher evidentiary threshold were required uniformly among all types of responses. Victim states, of course, could still increase the severity of their responses as needed to force the attacking state back into compliance with its international obligations, so long as the certainty in the attacker’s identity correspondingly increased.\nAdmittedly, such a standard might result in more severe and more frequent state responses against less sophisticated actors—who lack the ability to hide the evidence that leads to their identity—than sophisticated actors. But this is no different than any other system that requires evidentiary burdens to be met before responsive measures can be taken: even in domestic criminal ¹¹² See infra note 113.\n¹¹³ International Governmental Group of Experts, Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare 61 (Michael N. Schmitt ed., 2013).\n¹¹⁴ While outside the scope of this Note, there is no reason why such a standard could not be tied to any use of force, whether it be conventional or cyber. Indeed, there is a colorable argument that it would be wise to apply such a standard beyond the cyber context, particularly given the ad hoc factual evaluation of conventional use of force events and their associated attribution problems.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202 Lefebvre Cracking Attribution Part II further explores how evaluations of such evidence could be more publicly accountable by allowing states to submit their claims to a neutral body that would provide an attributional assessment of the offensive cyber operation, including a forensic report and a confidence judgment as to the culprit. It also examines how such a body could contribute to the creation of international norms—and, eventually, customary international law—that integrate this sliding-scale evidentiary framework and which make it clear what standard of proof a state should have to meet before responding with the use of force or countermeasures. In this way, the body could create a platform through which states could better define customary international law, even where attempts to build positive international law have stalled or failed.^[115]^ ## D. Frameworks for Assessing State Responsibility for Cyber Operations In contrast with standards of proof, principles of state responsibility are far better defined under international law, thanks to the ICJ's jurisprudence and the International Law Commission's (\"ILC\") Articles on State Responsibility. As a result, the second Tallinn Manual provides far more guidance about principles of state responsibility as they relate to cyber operations, beginning with Tallinn Rule 14's threshold^[116]^:\"A State bears international responsibility for a cyber-related act Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202 Lefebvre Cracking Attribution ¹¹⁷ Tallinn Manual 2.0, supra note 1, at 84.

Group of Governmental Experts on Information Security, a multilateral attempt to more firmly establish customary international law in the cyber context.¹³¹ Some, most notably Microsoft Corporation, the Atlantic Council, and the RAND Corporation, have called for the creation of an attributional organization that would investigate offensive cyber operations and provide assessments on the identity of the likely culprit or culprits.

    "## A. Building a Private Body for a Public Good": "In 2017, researchers at the RAND Corporation published a white paper proposing the creation of an attributional organization that would exclude states from its management and operation, referring to the proposed body as the “Global Cyber Attribution Consortium” (“the Consortium”).¹⁴⁰ Instead of states, RAND proposes that the body be managed and operated by cyberspace legal and policy experts, international policy experts from academia and research organizations, and technical experts from academia as well as cybersecurity and information technology companies.¹⁴¹ RAND recognizes that these actors are not immune to politicization: they may face pressures from their home markets or states of incorporation, or they may inherently possess strong national loyalties. But such a body would at least be further removed from state political interests and face more political accountability at the international level, to the extent that the companies and research organizations involved conduct global operations.¹⁴² Most\n¹³⁸ Davis et al., RAND Corp., supra note 51, at 31; see Efrony, supra note 133 (“None of the experts should be simultaneously employed by governmental institutions to avoid even the appearance of conflicts of interest.”).\n¹³⁹ Davis et al., RAND Corp., supra note 51, at 31.\n¹⁴⁰ Id at 27, 33. To be clear, by using the term “attribution organization,” the suggestion is that the organization engages exclusively in attributional assessments. Unlike the proposals suggested by Microsoft and the Atlantic Council, it has no enforcement function. See Charney, Microsoft Corp., supra note 12, at 11; Jason Healey, et al., Atlantic Council, Confidence-Building Measures in Cyberspace: A Multistakeholder Approach for Stability and Security 10 (2014).\n¹⁴¹ Davis et al., RAND Corp., supra note 51, at 29; see also Efrony, supra note 133 (supporting the idea of excluding states from a global attribution body).\n¹⁴² Admittedly, “global operations” does not mean such operations will be equal among all states. One might argue that states with more sophisticated technology sectors could have more influence over the Consortium than states with less sophisticated technology sectors, since such countries will likely have stronger ties to members of the Consortium. But given the wide network of global interests and partnerships that states with sophisticated technology sectors have, which often tie them to states with smaller technology sectors, it is unlikely that the Consortium could or would privilege states along this line. Consider, for example, Russia’s collaborative interests with Iran, or the United States’ strong relationship with Afghanistan. Given this, the more relevant distinction may be between those states with friends and those without.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202\nLefebvre\nCracking Attribution\nJust being further removed from the risk of politicization, however, is not enough. The nature of the organization’s work requires not only a better reputation for neutrality than what could be accomplished with an intergovernmental organization, but an incredibly strong reputation for neutrality and expertise. This would, at a minimum, require geographic diversity from each of the sectors represented and strict transparency in both its governance and evaluation methodologies and procedures.¹⁴³ As RAND puts it, with no international norms to rely upon at present, the Consortium can only derive its legitimacy over time from “the reputation and credibility gained from the technical expertise of its diverse global membership and its commitment to objectivity and transparency in its attribution findings.”¹⁴⁴ To deliver on the promise of providing more reliable and transparent attributional assessments than what states have offered to date, the Consortium would need to include formalized conditions that trigger its review, standardized processes for evidence collection and assessment, attribution-confidence standards, procedures for notification and publication of results, and standardized procedures to assess the severity and sophistication of offensive operations.¹⁴⁵ Indeed, standardization and transparency are two crucial elements missing from the current diffuse attribution regime. As discussed, because of the lack of clear evidentiary standards, states at present have little incentive to be transparent in their technical analysis.¹⁴⁶ Further, even ¹⁴³ See Davis et al., RAND Corp., supra note 51, at 30.\n¹⁴⁴ Id.\n¹⁴⁵ Davis et al., RAND Corp., supra note 51, at 35.\n¹⁴⁶ See supra Section I.C.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202 Lefebvre Cracking Attribution ¹⁴⁷ See Davis et al., RAND Corp., supra note 51, at 20; Max Smeets, When Naming Cyber Threat Actors Does More Harm Than Good, Council on Foreign Relations: Blog (Oct. 24, 2016), https://www.cfr.org/blog/when-naming-cyber-threat-actors-does-more-harm-good (“First, if a competitor has already discovered a threat actor, the threat actor shouldn’t be renamed to fit another company’s branding.

While the Consortium would only begin an investigation at the request of the victim,¹⁵² the question remains, at least in some cases, as to which victim would have the proper standing to file a request with the Consortium.¹⁵³ For example, if an electrical utility suffers an attack on its infrastructure, does the state retain exclusive rights to trigger the investigation and publicize the results or should the utility company have the ability to file an investigation request? RAND suggests leaving such decisions up to the discretion of the Consortium.¹⁵⁴ But granting a private entity standing to bring an investigation request makes little sense, particularly given the consequences for the victim state if the operation were publicized and a state or non-state actor were accused. At the time of the request’s filing, there may be little clue as to the identity of the attacker. The risks of giving a private entity the right to publicize attacks and accuse another state with the Consortium’s platform and credibility behind its claim could cause significant difficulties for states in planning and conducting their international relations.¹⁵⁵ While private entities may be hesitant to report attacks to their host states—particularly if they might be liable in some way for the intrusion—these concerns make it more prudent to favor giving states exclusive standing to bring the claim and to publicize the results.\n¹⁵¹ Id. at 39.\n¹⁵² Id.\n¹⁵³ Id. at 36.\n¹⁵⁴ Id.\n¹⁵⁵ This concern resembles those that some have been expressed about claims made under the Alien Tort Statute and their potential to interfere with the foreign affairs of the United States.

One state killing the nationals of another state would, at the very least, be activity “inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations.” U.N. Charter art. 2(4). Customary international law’s doctrine permitting the protection of nationals abroad seems to reflect that this is a sensible construction as does the principle of passive personality. See Restatement (Third) of the Foreign Relations Law of the U.S., § 402 cmt. g (Am. Law. Inst. 1987) (passive personality principle); Andrew W.R.

While this is yet another area that the RAND proposal does not discuss with much depth, it would be sensible for the Consortium to provide the accused state with an advance copy of the Consortium’s report and an opportunity to rebut its conclusion and aspects of forensic report. This stage of the investigation could provide victim states with an opportunity to supplement the technical report from the Consortium’s forensic investigation with evidence gained through the victim state’s intelligence capabilities, such as from SIGINT and HUMINT, perhaps presenting such information to the Consortium in camera. To the extent a victim state is unwilling to share its intelligence with the Consortium, the only cost would be a lower confidence level in the attribution assessment than the Consortium would otherwise be able to provide. Alternatively, the Consortium might be able to release its forensic report and confidence assessment of the identity of the individual operators but provide a no-confidence or low-confidence assessment of state responsibility. Such a report would, at the very least, be valuable if the victim state chose to indict the operators under its domestic criminal law.¹⁵⁸ ¹⁵⁸ See, e.g., Press Release, U.S. Dep’t of Justice, North Korean Regime-Backed Programmer Charged with Conspiracy to Conduct Multiple Cyber Attacks and Intrusions (Sept. 6, 2018), https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/north-korean-regime-backed-programmer-charged-conspiracy-conduct-multiple-cyber-attacks-and.

Further, in the investigations it would accept, its technical capabilities could still help to fill the evidentiary gap that states face in justifying countermeasures or self-defense, especially where the victim state’s technical capabilities are lacking.\nTo the extent that states are able to point to an independent body’s declassified cyber forensic investigation, a state’s justification for countermeasures would be built on firmer factual ground than if it only had its classified intelligence to rely upon. With a reduced ability to hide behind a claim of pretextual or false accusation, states might exercise more caution in conducting offensive cyber operations or might restrict themselves to low-level uses of force so as not to draw attention of the Consortium.¹⁵⁹ This is true whether or not key players in the international community choose to submit a case to the Consortium. One may expect that the United States, China, Israel, or Russia may at first feel more comfortable relying upon the technical sophistication of their own intelligence communities to reliably identify culprits and might reject opening up the process to an independent body. But unlike with the political backing needed in a multilateral treaty, the Consortium could still provide much-needed technical assistance to less sophisticated middle-power and developing states that are targets of cyber attacks and exploitations, without the Conducting Coordinated Campaign of Cyber Attacks Against U.S. Financial Sector (March 24, 2016), https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/seven-iranians-working-islamic-revolutionary-guard-corps-affiliated-entities-charged; Press Release, U.S. Dep’t Justice, U.S. Charges Five Chinese Military Hackers for Cyber Espionage Against U.S. Corporations and a Labor Organization for Commercial Advantage, (May 19, 2014), https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/us-charges-five-chinese-military-hackers-cyber-espionage-against-us-corporations-and-labor.\n¹⁵⁹ At least part of the blame for the difficulties of deterring offensive cyber operations lies with the challenges in reliably attributing the operations to the correct culprit.

Rather than have states act as their own judges of how much proof is necessary to respond to an attack,¹⁶² states might feel they are obligated to justify their actions in the face of a quantifiable confidence metric.\nStates might also choose to reference such assessments in their domestic prosecutions of the accused individuals. The United States, for example, has issued indictments against a number of foreign officials and others who use cyber operations to threaten U.S. national security.¹⁶³ If other states had access to similar technical resources to attribute attacks with a high enough degree ¹⁶⁰ See U.N.

    "## C. Challenges Ahead": "Despite the promise an independent non-governmental attribution body like the Consortium holds for building international norms, challenges remain for the Consortium’s effective execution. If independence is a key feature, from what sources could it responsibly derive funding? How will such a body prioritize its investigations and how will it deliver results quickly enough to meet the need for timely response that victim states will face? Further, without traditional sources of intelligence at hand, how will such a body meet the need to connect an operator’s activity with state direction and control in the case of state-sponsored attacks?\nRAND suggests initial funding from philanthropic sources and the inclusion of a charter mandate to seek funding from the United Nations at a later point.¹⁶⁶ RAND also points to the possibility of funding from cybersecurity and information technology companies that operate and defend much of the infrastructure upon which attacks are launched.¹⁶⁷ This might not be so far-fetched: if the Consortium were able to build a strong reputation in the international community,\n¹⁶⁴ Deeks, supra note 163.\n¹⁶⁵ See supra note 115.\n¹⁶⁶ Davis et al., RAND Corp., supra note 51, at 44.\n¹⁶⁷ Id. at 45.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202\nLefebvre\nCracking Attribution\nIf it could be done transparently, this Note suggests another solution: the Consortium might even charge clients fees for attribution services, in accordance with their ability to pay, basing its schedule off of the United Nations’ scale of assessments for the apportionment of its expenses.¹⁶⁸ Admittedly, this might introduce risks to its neutrality if the organization appears to demonstrate something akin to customer loyalty. If any attribution body were to accept fees for its services to offset its costs, its revenue streams would need to be diversified enough to prevent reliance on fees from any particular state, region, or global bloc.\nDeveloping prioritization policies may best be left to the discretion of the Consortium, given the variety of effects cyber attacks produce and the difficulty in organizing attacks by their severity. For example, the Consortium might be forced to choose between investigating a cyber attack that resulted in an explosion that killed tens of people or a ransomware attack that paralyzed the state’s ability to provide key services and cost its citizens and businesses hundreds of millions of dollars and maybe, indirectly, loss of life.¹⁶⁹ In this case, one might suggest investigating the former first, since the victim state in that case would have suffered an armed attack under the effects test¹⁷⁰ and would have the right to respond in self-defense, if such measures were necessary to prevent future attacks.¹⁷¹ However, one can imagine murkier cases where the severity might be tied to the degree of harm suffered by the victim. For example, two ostensibly different attacks on two different central bank accounts might result in the same amount of money lost, but one of ¹⁶⁸ Cf. G.A. Res. 70/245 (December 23, 2015) (detailing the U.N. scale of assessments).\n¹⁶⁹ Cf. supra note 6–7 and accompanying text (detailing cyber attacks that either did or would have resulted in similar damage).\n¹⁷⁰ Tallinn Manual 2.0, supra note 1, at 340–41.\n¹⁷¹ U.N. Charter, art. 51.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202 Lefebvre Cracking Attribution Even if the Consortium were able to develop severity prioritization rules, the body might not be able to complete the investigation in a timely enough fashion for a state to respond. If a state continues to suffer armed attacks or uses of force, the victim might need to respond with self-defense measures under Article 51 or enact countermeasures in order to bring the culprit back into compliance with its international obligations. In such a situation, the Consortium might be able to release preliminary findings at a lower confidence level. Acting on any such findings could operate under a “buyer beware” framework, a concept that would tie nicely with the sliding-scale evidentiary framework proposed in Section I.C.¹⁷² Over time, international norms—and perhaps, eventually, customary international law—could be built around the level of confidence expected from attributional assessments before a state could pursue countermeasures, invoke pleas of necessity, or undertake acts of self-defense. The Consortium’s findings would make the adoption of this sliding-scale evidentiary framework more easily possible, since the findings would provide a quantifiable, standardized, and easily referenced confidence level for the international community to debate. Over time, this transparency could help develop international law’s standards of proof by providing more transparent examples of state practice, leading to easier identification of the *opinio juris* needed to locate customary international law. For example, one might find, after mapping the Consortium’s confidence levels of its attribution assessments to the corresponding state responses, that states are only willing to enact countermeasures on confidence levels of fifty percent or higher and self-defense measures on confidence levels of seventy-five percent or higher.\n¹⁷² See supra note 109–111 and accompanying text.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202 Lefebvre Cracking Attribution Perhaps the most significant challenge facing the Consortium is the ostensibly low likelihood that competing tech companies would come together to participate in the organization.

While multilateral treaties and international cooperation might be the preferred avenue to overcome them, current trends provide little hope for the success of such options. Despite this, the development of customary international law provides an opportunity to push forward in regulating state behavior surrounding cyberspace. This Note demonstrates how an attributional body like the Consortium stands to provide substantial benefit to the development of these norms by providing states with a transparent and independent mechanism upon which to build evidentiary standards, such as the sliding-scale evidentiary framework, to undergird countermeasures and acts of self-defense. In this way, the international community can make more consistent judgments about state action in response to offensive cyber operations. While this may provide less flexibility for states to act in the face of such operations than what is nearly guaranteed through today's system of opaque unilateral evidentiary assessments, such restrictions on state behavior would benefit the international community at large by increasing global stability. Further, adopting this Note's version of a sliding-scale approach to the standard of proof—one where the standard fluctuates based on the response a victim wishes to undertake—should accommodate the flexibility states need when attempting to respond to quickly to a cyber attack.\nBy offering both victim states and the accused the opportunity to obtain an independent, sophisticated, and quantifiable attributional assessment, a body like the Consortium could help alleviate the deterrence difficulties inherent in a low-confidence attribution landscape and reduce the risk that states escalate or begin conflicts with parties that have no relation to the conflict. Questions persist regarding sources of funding for the Consortium, its operational efficiency in light of the need for quick responses to severe offensive operations, and the remaining difficulty Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202 Lefebvre Cracking Attribution Whatever the case, the world will not stand still in the cyber landscape. If international law is to be of any value in restricting dangerous state behavior in this arena, its development must push forward. States can still do their part to gradually advance international norms by responsibly conducting their own cyber practices and related behavior in an effort to shape customary international law. An independent non-governmental attributional body like the Consortium provides a powerful launchpad for them to do just that.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202"

Such a framework would replace the malleable and opaque ad hoc determinations of responsibility that states currently undertake in both the conventional force and the cyber contexts alike. To this end, this Note introduces a sliding-scale evidentiary standard that adapts to the—often limited—availability of evidence and short amount of time a victim might have to respond to cyber attacks.\nThis Note analogizes to attribution problems faced by the international community in the past, such as piracy and privateering on the eighteenth century’s high seas, to demonstrate that the legal problems posed by cyber capabilities are not unfamiliar. But the ubiquity of cyber capabilities and diffuse nature of the cyber landscape mean that the solution must be different. This Note demonstrates that a newly proposed non-governmental attribution body, structured like a tribunal, could meet the tremendous need many victims face in gathering the evidence to overcome the attribution problem inherent to cyberspace. Such a body, this Note argues, provides the best launchpad for developing the international norms—and, eventually, the customary international law—needed to build evidentiary standards in the cyber context.\nINTRODUCTION ... 1\nI.

Treaties dealing directly with cyber operations are scarce in number and limited in scope. State cyber practices are held close to the chest and, although their publicly available expressions are increasing, there are still too few to constitute well-defined norms to develop comprehensive customary international law. While it at least seems clear today that existing principles of international law apply in cyberspace, states—perhaps as a result of their own strategic caution—have, at present, left to the academy and non-governmental bodies much of the task of determining how such principles apply. Against this hazy legal backdrop, states and non-state actors alike have wasted no time in deploying cyber attacks and exploitations of ever more destructive and exploitative power. In June 2017, according to the U.S. government, the Russian military launched “the most destructive and costly cyber attack in history,” using ransomware dubbed “NotPetya” to cause billions of dollars in damage across Europe, the Americas, and Asia. Just two months later, in August 2017, a petrochemical plant in Saudi Arabia suffered a cyber attack that was designed to trigger an explosion that likely\n Introduction to International Governmental Group of Experts, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations 3 (Michael N.

Most notably, the first and second Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations, written by the International Group of Experts (“IGE”), have proven to be influential in detailing how international principles apply to cyberspace and, in particular, their application to cyber warfare. But even where consensus can be built around which principles of international law apply to cyberspace, a key roadblock remains toward much of their implementation. Namely, the application of state responsibility principles remains difficult—if not impossible—where victims cannot reliably and transparently identify the actor responsible or, worse, if the attacker’s identity remains unknown.

It then explores the evidentiary framework by which attribution claims in both the conventional and cyber context are measured. In doing so, it attempts to identify and help fill the gap in the academic literature surrounding what standards of proof are and should be expected to be met under international law. Toward this end, it introduces a novel application of a sliding scale of proof, one tied to the severity of the victim’s response rather than solely to the underlying breach of international law. Part I then concludes by providing a brief overview of how principles of state responsibility apply in cyberspace.\nPart II identifies a number of the proposed solutions to the attribution problem suggested in the literature—such as intergovernmental inspection and compliance bodies as well as multilateral treaties—and explains why they are inadequate in the cyber context or are unlikely to come about. It then critiques and builds upon the solution highlighted by this Note: a non-governmental global consortium of representatives from private companies, academia, and think tanks that assesses available forensic evidence to provide an attributional assessment for victims of cyber attack or exploitation. But the value of this organization does not just lie in its ability to provide a much-needed leader for neutral and capable technical investigations. Rather, it has significant potential to lay the groundwork for the proposed sliding-scale evidentiary framework’s\n See Waxman, supra note 4, at 426.\n While this Note recognizes the benefits of solutions that propose an intergovernmental organization to govern cyber capability use and compliance, akin to the International Atomic Energy Agency (“IAEA”), see, e.g., Scott Charney et al., Microsoft Corp., From Articulation to Implementation: Enabling Progress on Cybersecurity Norms 11 (2016), it also recognizes that states are highly unlikely in today’s toxic geopolitical environment to agree to allow representatives from foreign governments to inspect some of their most closely held secrets. Further, significant doubts might arise as to the neutrality of governmental representatives serving in the body’s management and operational roles, risking the legitimacy and independence of the body’s assessments.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202\nLefebvre\nCracking Attribution\n\nRather than have states judge for themselves how much proof is necessary to respond to an attack, this Note argues that states might feel obligated to justify their actions in the face of a quantifiable confidence metric, one that could be provided by the proposed non-governmental attribution body. Through reference to the attributional assessment of a neutral and sophisticated body, a state's self-defense and countermeasure activities could rest on a firmer and more transparent evidentiary foundation. In this way, this Note makes the novel suggestion that this non-governmental organization could serve as the best launchpad for developing customary international law to build evidentiary standards in the cyber context.\n## I. DEFINING THE ATTRIBUTION PROBLEM AND ITS SCOPE\nThe attribution problem is often viewed as a technical challenge with a technical solution: the tools of offensive cyber operations make it easy to hide one's identity from a victim, so would-be victims need to build cyber defensive capabilities and cyber forensic investigative capabilities to overcome this challenge. But the limitations of cyber defensive and investigative capabilities can and do pose obstacles to the application of international law. Principally, they foreground the question of how a state could respond lawfully under international law if it does not know against whom it should respond. The immensity of this problem, however, overshadows the subsequent\n See infra note 78 and accompanying text.\n This Note keys the term “self-defense” to its meaning under Article 51 of the U.N. Charter, limiting it to a victim state’s uses of force taken against an aggressor state in response to an armed attack. U.N. Charter, art. 51.\n In this Note, the term “countermeasures” is used as a term of art. It refers to actions taken by a victim state that amount to a breach of its international obligations vis-à-vis an aggressor state. Such actions must be taken with the goal of bringing the aggressor state back into compliance with its international obligations vis-à-vis the victim state and cannot exceed what is necessary and proportionate to effectuate that goal. Without the preceding act of aggression, these actions would otherwise be considered unlawful. Int’l. L. Comm’n, Rep. on the Work of its Fifty-Third Session, U.N. Doc. A/56/10, at 128–31 (2001).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202\nLefebvre\nCracking Attribution\n\nThis Part addresses both of these obstacles. It demonstrates why reliable, standardized, and transparent determinations of a cyber attacker’s identity—referred to throughout this Note as “attributional assessments” or “attributional claims”—are necessary to the successful application of international law’s principles to cyberspace, and it evaluates how customary international law could be developed to meet this end. Toward this effort, Section I.C addresses a relative gap in the literature by assessing what standard of proof is and should be necessary when making an attributional claim.\nFor the purposes of this Note, “attribution” is tied to identity, rather than an action’s particular cause. In this context, attribution refers to the process of determining the “identity or location of an attacker or an attacker’s intermediary.” To qualify as an interstate attributional claim, the identity of the attack or exploitation’s independent operators must be connected with customary international law’s principles of state responsibility, largely reflected in the second Tallinn Manual and discussed in Section I.D. Ultimately, once the technical assessment of the\n Waxman, supra note 4, at 426 (“[T]he low visibility of states’ moves and countermoves in cyberspace will slow the process of interpretive development . . . . Article 2(4) will probably be a weak constraint on offensive cyber-attacks because of, among other reasons, the difficulty of observing them and attributing them to their sources or sponsors . . . . Those weaknesses will . . . likely plague any attempt to negotiate and enforce new international agreements limiting cyber-warfare.”).\n David D.

Conventional Parallels\nThe difficulty in linking attacks to the identity of the attacker is not a new problem for international law: states have struggled with making such determinations for centuries. This is true where another state has been the attacker, where a non-state actor acting under its own direction has been the attacker, and where state proxies acting under the direction of a sponsoring state have been the source of the attacks. Some commentators have drawn parallels between today’s challenges in policing cyberspace to those created by the state use of privateers on the high seas in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Florian Egloff notes how both the high seas through that period and cyberspace involve a range of actors, each with varying degrees of direction and control from a sponsoring state. Between these two different eras and environments, the parallels between state actors, semi-state actors, and non-state actors can be readily drawn: respectively, consider the similarities between formal navies and cyber military units, privateers and today’s “patriotic hackers,” or even pirates and most modern cybercriminals or cybercrime organizations.\n See infra note 66.\n Florian Egloff, Cybersecurity and the Age of Privateering, in Understanding Cyber Conflict: 14 Analogies 231, (George Perkovich &amp; Ariel E.

This came about in large part from the transition from conventional war-making to “unconventional [and] low-intensity conflict [that] featured inconclusive evidence of foreign involvement or hostile action, and foreign state antagonists [who] worked to mask, conceal, or obscure their participation and responses.” As with today’s cyber attacks and exploitations, “once\n Carl J.

The parallels, however, highlight the international legal problems posed when the identity of an attacker is uncertain. While technical attribution capabilities are increasing for many states, including the United States, the identification of the machine or machines used in carrying out the attack, their operators, or even the geographic locations of the machines and their operators is not always enough when making a determination of state responsibility. Yet the stakes are high. If the injured state responds to a wrongful act under international law with a countermeasure aimed at a wrongly accused state, then the injured state has then committed an internationally wrongful act by engaging in countermeasures against an innocent state. Simply put, the international legal framework currently in place for responding to uses of force, armed attacks, and other breaches of international obligations cannot function properly without reliable attributional assessments, regardless of whether the unlawful action occurs in the context of a cyber or a traditional physical operation.\n Id.\n See Banks, supra note 2, at 1493 (describing some of the technical challenges posed by cyber attacks and exploitations).\n Banks, supra note 2, at 1502.

These two components comprise factual inquiries, of course, into what machines were used to carry out an attack, who operated them, and who directed or controlled those operators for purposes of the operation.\nAt the most basic level, an offensive cyber operation involves one or more individuals, often acting remotely, who interfaces with one or more computers or entire networks—usually by means of programming code—in order to gain access to the targeted systems through hardware or software security vulnerabilities or through fraudulent credentials. Once the operation’s conductors have gained access to the desired system, they attempt to take advantage of the system to plant code, known as malware, that will destroy or degrade the intruded system, exfiltrate information from the system, or both.\nCyber operations pose significant and unique challenges in the evidentiary context as it relates to both the identity of the operator and attribution to a state. This is in part because the operations are “opaque to public view, technically very complex and likely to emerge piecemeal,” unlike conventional kinetic attacks, which are visible and “can be and often are broadcast widely, immediately, and understandably [and, further, the] common experience [of such attacks] makes\n See Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua (Nicar. v.

For example, in 2015, the French-language television network TV5Monde saw its networks attacked by an organization that made references to a “Cyber Caliphate” and “Je suis IS,” leading to an initial attribution to Islamic State. After further investigation, however, the attack appeared to be a false flag: FireEye and the National Cybersecurity Agency of France found leads that traced back to a highly sophisticated Russian group labelled by cybersecurity firms as, among other names, “Advanced Persistent Threat 28,” “Fancy Bear,” and “Sofacy.” The group is believed to have ties to the Russian government and is considered to have played a role in the cyber operation against the Democratic National Committee in 2016 and against the German Bundestag in 2015.\n1.

States often meet the shortcomings of forensic technical analysis with signals intelligence (\"SIGINT\") and human intelligence (\"HUMINT\") resources. In the case of SIGINT, this includes methods such as collection of the content or metadata from phone records, emails, and other communications. HUMINT includes sources such as interviews with recruited foreign agents. Despite the private sector's incredible technical forensics capabilities—which can rival that of states in terms of its technical capacity to identify offensive cyber operators—some of these more traditional sources of intelligence are unavailable to even the most sophisticated cybersecurity firms. While Symantec, Kaspersky, FireEye, CrowdStrike, and others may have an incredible talent pool and significant financial resources, they do not \"control the wires\" nor can they deploy on-the-ground espionage operations to develop critical intelligence to help implicate responsible states or better ascertain the identities of operators.\nBut even those states that are able to meet the factual challenge of identifying an attacker with a high degree of confidence are often unwilling to release much of the evidence on which\n See supra notes 49–55 and accompanying text (discussing the offensive cyber operation against TV5Monde).\n See Cyber Warfare in the 21st Century: Threats, Challenges, and Opportunities: Hearing Before the H.

Is There an Attribution Standard for Cyberspace Under International Law?\nIn the cyber context, the answers to the evidentiary questions are even more underdeveloped due to the paucity of transparent state practice and *opinio juris*—a term that refers to a state’s sense of legal obligation—in making public attributional statements for offensive cyber operations. In its 2015 report, the U.N. Group of Governmental Experts acknowledged that attribution claims for cyber operations “should be substantiated.” But the report failed to articulate how much or what type of evidence is necessary for states to justify countermeasures or acts of self-defense under international law, or even whether such claims must be substantiated publicly. The United States has gone one step further in articulating its position on the matter in remarks made in November 2016 by then-U.S. Department of State Legal Adviser Brian Egan:\n See Tallinn Manual 2.0, supra note 1, at 83. In order to establish customary international law, there must be a history of state practice driven by a sense of legal obligation, referred to as *opinion juris*.\n Rep. of the Group of Governmental Experts on Devs. in the Field of Info. and Telecomms. in the Context of Int’l Security, transmitted by Letter Dated 26 June 2015 from Deborah Stokes (Chair of the Group), U.N.

The commentary accompanying the Draft Articles on State Responsibility notes:\nIn a bilateral dispute over State responsibility, the onus of establishing responsibility lies in principle on the claimant State. Where conduct in conflict with an international obligation is attributable to a State and that State seeks to avoid its responsibility by relying on a circumstance under chapter V [which describes circumstances precluding wrongfulness], however, the position changes and the onus lies on that State to justify or excuse its conduct.\nThis is echoed in the ICJ’s judgment in the *Oil Platforms* case. In that case, the ICJ indicated that the United States bore the burden of proving that Iranian forces fired a missile at the *Sea Isle City*, a Kuwaiti tanker reflagged to the United States, which had made a defensive claim for which it used this evidence as the factual basis.\n Banks, supra note 2, at 1507; see Cyber Warfare in the 21st Century: Threats, Challenges, and Opportunities: Hearing Before the H.

Nor does it seem that states carry a well-defined burden under international law related to the quality or amount of evidence used in proving an attributional claim before undertaking acts of self-defense or countermeasures against the accused state. Further, strikingly few commentators have even addressed the issue of evidentiary burdens under international law. But despite the IGE’s findings and the claims that states like the United States have made about (non-)obligations under international law, there is a contingent of those few who have argued the contrary. Such commentators claim that sufficient state practice exists to locate the standard of proof required of attribution claims.\nProfessor Mary Ellen O’Connell has argued that, at least in situations in which states are justifying the use of force under Article 51’s self-defense provision, state practice and the decisions of international courts and tribunals support a “clear and convincing” standard in evaluating evidence. She claims that “the international authority for the standard consists of several\n See also Banks, supra note 2, at 1499 (“Applying the Rules on State Responsibility and attribution compiled in Tallinn 2.0, there is no burden of proof or requirement that there exists definitive information on attribution.

State practice on its own is insufficient to establish customary international law; it is only when it is done out of a sense of legal obligation, or *opinio juris*, that it can be considered customary international law. Further, the fact that she only cites U.S. practice draws into question whether one state’s practice is enough, even if the United States were acting out of a sense of legal obligation. Lastly, the United States and any number of other states have a multitude of political reasons to indicate that they are in possession of “clear” or “convincing” evidence. There is no suggestion that such states believe that this is an evidentiary floor that must be met under international law before they can act on the evidence in their possession.\n O’Connell, supra note 31, at 23–28.\n But see Mark Landler &amp; Michael R.

Indeed, the ICJ’s proceedings only require enough proof to “satisfy” the ICJ in law and in fact, a rather flexible standard. Conceivably, as the ICJ suggested in its decision in the Nicaragua case, the ICJ may find itself satisfied with applying different standards of proof in different contexts, depending on the amount of evidence available or the difficulty in proving particular claims. This makes it even more difficult to make an inference about the standard it is using to judge the facts before it. Particularly since there is little state practice and no apparent opinio juris to support a standard of proof for state attribution claims against other states for a breach of an international obligation, any inferences about the standard of proof used by the ICJ appear to be cabined to that international body. This only becomes clearer when one considers that the ICJ derives its power to set a standard of proof from its foundational statute. It is not derived from principles of customary international law or some other species of international law that has broad impact\n Case Concerning Oil Platforms (Islamic Republic of Iran v.

The Value of a Sliding-Scale Attribution Standard\nThe absence of a standard of proof in these matters may be surprising, but it is likely—at least in part—a reflection of the reluctance among nations to share closely guarded intelligence methods on a global stage in front of ally and adversary alike. There is little doubt, however, that developing international norms to establish a standard of proof for attributional claims before undertaking countermeasures or self-defense measures would force states to exercise restraint in using these tools. One would hope that such restraint could help prevent conflicts from escalating or even spilling over into wrongly accused states that had no previous role in a particular conflict. Problems arise, though, in determining how high such a standard should be for cyber operations, given the difficulty many states face in being able to make an attributional claim with a high degree of confidence in a short amount of time. Any standard of proof employed should be sufficiently flexible to allow a state to act quickly enough for its countermeasures to serve as an adequate means of forcing the offending state back into compliance with its international\n See Statute of the International Court of Justice, June 26, 1945, art. 53(2), 59 Stat. 1055, 1062, T.S. No. 993.\n The reluctance, of course, is not unfounded. Sharing intelligence with adversaries can better clue them into the methods of the victim state’s intelligence collection, helping adversaries to better identify their own security vulnerabilities. For one example of how providing intelligence can change an adversary’s behavior in a way that threatens a state’s national security, see Eric Schmitt &amp; Michael S. Schmidt, *Queda Plot Leak Has Undermined U.S. Intelligence*, N.Y. Times (Sept. 29, 2013), https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/30/us/qaeda-plot-leak-has-undermined-us-intelligence.html (describing how after an intelligence leak, analysis have detected a sharp drop in terrorists’ use of a major communications channel that had been monitored by U.S. officials).\n U.N.

A/66/152 (July 15, 2011) (reply received from the United States) (“The lack of timely, high-confidence attribution and the possibility of ‘spoofing’ can create uncertainty and confusion for Governments, thus increasing the potential for crisis instability, misdirected responses and loss of escalation control during major cyberincidents.”).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202\nLefebvre\nCracking Attribution\n\nA standard of proof tied to the anticipated severity of the victim state’s response rather than to the severity of the underlying breach might meet the goals of timely response while adapting to the lower quality and quantity of evidence available to the victim state shortly after suffering an offensive cyber operation. For example, the victim state might only need to find on the balance of evidence that a particular state is responsible for an offensive cyber operation if deploying countermeasures, such as the violation of a treaty between the victim and aggressor states, but it may need clear-and-convincing evidence to respond with a use of armed force. This proposal falls in line with the second Tallinn Manual’s suggestion that “the greater the underlying breach . . . the greater the confidence ought to be in the evidence relied upon by a State considering a response” since the “robustness of permissible self-help responses grows commensurately with the seriousness of the breach.” For example, a state should be more confident in its attribution when it responds with armed force to a cyber attack on an air traffic control system that resulted in aircraft accidents and fatalities. The same should be expected if it were to suffer an attack on the underground pump controllers for an underground rail system that resulted in major flooding and destruction of its infrastructure. If a state were to suffer a denial of service attack on the website of a regulatory agency that issues permits for hunting and fishing, however, principles of necessity and proportionality dictate that the victim state would only be permitted to respond with something\n Professors Christian Payne and Lorraine Finlay have proposed a standard of proof tied to the victim’s response, but they have failed to provide much detail other than suggesting victim states that “pursue peaceful, legal processes” for resolving disputes related to cyber operations should “have the benefit of eschewing stringent attribution tests normally required.” Payne &amp; Finlay, supra note 5, at 567. In such cases, they suggest strict liability for those states that the victim state believes to be the host states for the attack. Id. at 566–67. They do not discuss the standard of proof necessary to undertake countermeasures and argue that the “effective control” standard is required for self-defense measures. Id.; see also infra note 132 and accompanying text (discussing the “effective control” standard).\n Tallinn Manual 2.0, supra note 1, at 82 (citing Oil Platforms, 2003 I.C.J. at ¶ 67 (separate opinion of Judge Higgins)).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202\nLefebvre\nCracking Attribution\n\nUnder a shifting standard of proof for attributional claims, a state could respond to the first two examples with countermeasures if it perhaps only had probable cause that a given state had conducted the attacks. After acquiring evidence to prove its attributional claim at a higher standard of proof, such as clear-and-convincing evidence, a state could respond with armed force if it were to conclude that such force would be proportional and necessary to repel the attack or later attacks. This shifting standard of proof does not change the ultimate severity ceiling of the response available to the victim state, which is still tied to the underlying breach and governed by principles of proportionality and necessity; rather, it adapts the severity of the response to the standard of proof that the victim state is able to meet at any given point. This would allow victim states to respond—at least in some fashion—more quickly, and thereby more effectively, to offensive cyber operations than if a higher evidentiary threshold were required uniformly among all types of responses. Victim states, of course, could still increase the severity of their responses as needed to force the attacking state back into compliance with its international obligations, so long as the certainty in the attacker’s identity correspondingly increased.\nAdmittedly, such a standard might result in more severe and more frequent state responses against less sophisticated actors—who lack the ability to hide the evidence that leads to their identity—than sophisticated actors. But this is no different than any other system that requires evidentiary burdens to be met before responsive measures can be taken: even in domestic criminal\n See infra note 113.\n International Governmental Group of Experts, Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare 61 (Michael N. Schmitt ed., 2013).\n While outside the scope of this Note, there is no reason why such a standard could not be tied to any use of force, whether it be conventional or cyber. Indeed, there is a colorable argument that it would be wise to apply such a standard beyond the cyber context, particularly given the ad hoc factual evaluation of conventional use of force events and their associated attribution problems.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202\nLefebvre\nCracking Attribution\n\nPart II further explores how evaluations of such evidence could be more publicly accountable by allowing states to submit their claims to a neutral body that would provide an attributional assessment of the offensive cyber operation, including a forensic report and a confidence judgment as to the culprit. It also examines how such a body could contribute to the creation of international norms—and, eventually, customary international law—that integrate this sliding-scale evidentiary framework and which make it clear what standard of proof a state should have to meet before responding with the use of force or countermeasures. In this way, the body could create a platform through which states could better define customary international law, even where attempts to build positive international law have stalled or failed.^[115]^\n## D. Frameworks for Assessing State Responsibility for Cyber Operations\nIn contrast with standards of proof, principles of state responsibility are far better defined under international law, thanks to the ICJ's jurisprudence and the International Law Commission's (\"ILC\") Articles on State Responsibility. As a result, the second Tallinn Manual provides far more guidance about principles of state responsibility as they relate to cyber operations, beginning with Tallinn Rule 14's threshold^[116]^: \"A State bears international responsibility for a cyber-related act\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202\nLefebvre\nCracking Attribution\n\n Tallinn Manual 2.0, supra note 1, at 84. The language “breach of an international legal obligation” is particularly important, since it does not include activities that are either unregulated by international law, such as cyber espionage and related intelligence gathering, or are expressly permitted, such as suspension of international cyber communication services within its territory.

Despite differences in what evidence is required, the evidentiary standard remains the same for each. Thus, in order to reach an attribution conclusion, the analysis developed in the previous Section should be applied not just to factual determinations that lead to the identities of individual cyber operators, but to factual determinations that lead to conclusions about state responsibility.\n## II.

Given the United States’ role in the international community and its strength in the cyber landscape, there is little hope of building a productive multilateral agreement without its support. But the United States’ preferred path forward has encountered its own roadblocks after the collapse of consensus among the U.N. Group of Governmental Experts on Information Security, a multilateral attempt to more firmly establish customary international law in the cyber context.\nSome, most notably Microsoft Corporation, the Atlantic Council, and the RAND Corporation, have called for the creation of an attributional organization that would investigate offensive cyber operations and provide assessments on the identity of the likely culprit or culprits. Microsoft and the Atlantic Council have suggested that the body be built as an intergovernmental compliance and attribution body akin to the International Atomic Energy Agency (“IAEA”) or the\n International Cybersecurity Strategy: Deterring Foreign Threats and Building Global Cyber Norms: Hearing Before the Subcomm.

This is in part because the United States takes an “effects” view the term “cyber weapon,” rather than seeing them as a class of tools that are identifiable as weapons in and of themselves. That is to say, the United States considers a cyber tool a weapon based on the effects of its use rather than based on the nature of its architecture. This may be driven by differences in how the United States, Russia, and China view “information” as a threat to national security.

Building a Private Body for a Public Good\nIn 2017, researchers at the RAND Corporation published a white paper proposing the creation of an attributional organization that would exclude states from its management and operation, referring to the proposed body as the “Global Cyber Attribution Consortium” (“the Consortium”). Instead of states, RAND proposes that the body be managed and operated by cyberspace legal and policy experts, international policy experts from academia and research organizations, and technical experts from academia as well as cybersecurity and information technology companies. RAND recognizes that these actors are not immune to politicization: they may face pressures from their home markets or states of incorporation, or they may inherently possess strong national loyalties. But such a body would at least be further removed from state political interests and face more political accountability at the international level, to the extent that the companies and research organizations involved conduct global operations. Most\n Davis et al., RAND Corp., supra note 51, at 31; see Efrony, supra note 133 (“None of the experts should be simultaneously employed by governmental institutions to avoid even the appearance of conflicts of interest.”).\n Davis et al., RAND Corp., supra note 51, at 31.\n Id at 27, 33. To be clear, by using the term “attribution organization,” the suggestion is that the organization engages exclusively in attributional assessments. Unlike the proposals suggested by Microsoft and the Atlantic Council, it has no enforcement function. See Charney, Microsoft Corp., supra note 12, at 11; Jason Healey, et al., Atlantic Council, Confidence-Building Measures in Cyberspace: A Multistakeholder Approach for Stability and Security 10 (2014).\n Davis et al., RAND Corp., supra note 51, at 29; see also Efrony, supra note 133 (supporting the idea of excluding states from a global attribution body).\n Admittedly, “global operations” does not mean such operations will be equal among all states. One might argue that states with more sophisticated technology sectors could have more influence over the Consortium than states with less sophisticated technology sectors, since such countries will likely have stronger ties to members of the Consortium. But given the wide network of global interests and partnerships that states with sophisticated technology sectors have, which often tie them to states with smaller technology sectors, it is unlikely that the Consortium could or would privilege states along this line. Consider, for example, Russia’s collaborative interests with Iran, or the United States’ strong relationship with Afghanistan. Given this, the more relevant distinction may be between those states with friends and those without.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202\nLefebvre\nCracking Attribution\n\nJust being further removed from the risk of politicization, however, is not enough. The nature of the organization’s work requires not only a better reputation for neutrality than what could be accomplished with an intergovernmental organization, but an incredibly strong reputation for neutrality and expertise. This would, at a minimum, require geographic diversity from each of the sectors represented and strict transparency in both its governance and evaluation methodologies and procedures. As RAND puts it, with no international norms to rely upon at present, the Consortium can only derive its legitimacy over time from “the reputation and credibility gained from the technical expertise of its diverse global membership and its commitment to objectivity and transparency in its attribution findings.”\nTo deliver on the promise of providing more reliable and transparent attributional assessments than what states have offered to date, the Consortium would need to include formalized conditions that trigger its review, standardized processes for evidence collection and assessment, attribution-confidence standards, procedures for notification and publication of results, and standardized procedures to assess the severity and sophistication of offensive operations. Indeed, standardization and transparency are two crucial elements missing from the current diffuse attribution regime. As discussed, because of the lack of clear evidentiary standards, states at present have little incentive to be transparent in their technical analysis. Further, even\n See Davis et al., RAND Corp., supra note 51, at 30.\n Id.\n Davis et al., RAND Corp., supra note 51, at 35.\n See supra Section I.C.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202\nLefebvre\nCracking Attribution\n\n See Davis et al., RAND Corp., supra note 51, at 20; Max Smeets, When Naming Cyber Threat Actors Does More Harm Than Good, Council on Foreign Relations: Blog (Oct. 24, 2016), https://www.cfr.org/blog/when-naming-cyber-threat-actors-does-more-harm-good (“First, if a competitor has already discovered a threat actor, the threat actor shouldn’t be renamed to fit another company’s branding.

While the Consortium would only begin an investigation at the request of the victim, the question remains, at least in some cases, as to which victim would have the proper standing to file a request with the Consortium. For example, if an electrical utility suffers an attack on its infrastructure, does the state retain exclusive rights to trigger the investigation and publicize the results or should the utility company have the ability to file an investigation request? RAND suggests leaving such decisions up to the discretion of the Consortium. But granting a private entity standing to bring an investigation request makes little sense, particularly given the consequences for the victim state if the operation were publicized and a state or non-state actor were accused. At the time of the request’s filing, there may be little clue as to the identity of the attacker. The risks of giving a private entity the right to publicize attacks and accuse another state with the Consortium’s platform and credibility behind its claim could cause significant difficulties for states in planning and conducting their international relations. While private entities may be hesitant to report attacks to their host states—particularly if they might be liable in some way for the intrusion—these concerns make it more prudent to favor giving states exclusive standing to bring the claim and to publicize the results.\n Id. at 39.\n Id.\n Id. at 36.\n Id.\n This concern resembles those that some have been expressed about claims made under the Alien Tort Statute and their potential to interfere with the foreign affairs of the United States.

One state killing the nationals of another state would, at the very least, be activity “inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations.” U.N. Charter art. 2(4). Customary international law’s doctrine permitting the protection of nationals abroad seems to reflect that this is a sensible construction as does the principle of passive personality. See Restatement (Third) of the Foreign Relations Law of the U.S., § 402 cmt. g (Am. Law. Inst. 1987) (passive personality principle); Andrew W.R.

While this is yet another area that the RAND proposal does not discuss with much depth, it would be sensible for the Consortium to provide the accused state with an advance copy of the Consortium’s report and an opportunity to rebut its conclusion and aspects of forensic report. This stage of the investigation could provide victim states with an opportunity to supplement the technical report from the Consortium’s forensic investigation with evidence gained through the victim state’s intelligence capabilities, such as from SIGINT and HUMINT, perhaps presenting such information to the Consortium in camera. To the extent a victim state is unwilling to share its intelligence with the Consortium, the only cost would be a lower confidence level in the attribution assessment than the Consortium would otherwise be able to provide. Alternatively, the Consortium might be able to release its forensic report and confidence assessment of the identity of the individual operators but provide a no-confidence or low-confidence assessment of state responsibility. Such a report would, at the very least, be valuable if the victim state chose to indict the operators under its domestic criminal law.\n See, e.g., Press Release, U.S. Dep’t of Justice, North Korean Regime-Backed Programmer Charged with Conspiracy to Conduct Multiple Cyber Attacks and Intrusions (Sept. 6, 2018), https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/north-korean-regime-backed-programmer-charged-conspiracy-conduct-multiple-cyber-attacks-and.

Further, in the investigations it would accept, its technical capabilities could still help to fill the evidentiary gap that states face in justifying countermeasures or self-defense, especially where the victim state’s technical capabilities are lacking.\nTo the extent that states are able to point to an independent body’s declassified cyber forensic investigation, a state’s justification for countermeasures would be built on firmer factual ground than if it only had its classified intelligence to rely upon. With a reduced ability to hide behind a claim of pretextual or false accusation, states might exercise more caution in conducting offensive cyber operations or might restrict themselves to low-level uses of force so as not to draw attention of the Consortium. This is true whether or not key players in the international community choose to submit a case to the Consortium. One may expect that the United States, China, Israel, or Russia may at first feel more comfortable relying upon the technical sophistication of their own intelligence communities to reliably identify culprits and might reject opening up the process to an independent body. But unlike with the political backing needed in a multilateral treaty, the Consortium could still provide much-needed technical assistance to less sophisticated middle-power and developing states that are targets of cyber attacks and exploitations, without the\nConducting Coordinated Campaign of Cyber Attacks Against U.S. Financial Sector (March 24, 2016), https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/seven-iranians-working-islamic-revolutionary-guard-corps-affiliated-entities-charged; Press Release, U.S. Dep’t Justice, U.S. Charges Five Chinese Military Hackers for Cyber Espionage Against U.S. Corporations and a Labor Organization for Commercial Advantage, (May 19, 2014), https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/us-charges-five-chinese-military-hackers-cyber-espionage-against-us-corporations-and-labor.\n At least part of the blame for the difficulties of deterring offensive cyber operations lies with the challenges in reliably attributing the operations to the correct culprit.

By tracking how states choose to respond to cyber attacks or exploitations and connecting those responses to the confidence level provided in the Consortium’s assessment, one might find that international norms develop around the amount of proof necessary before states feel it is permissible to respond. Rather than have states act as their own judges of how much proof is necessary to respond to an attack, states might feel they are obligated to justify their actions in the face of a quantifiable confidence metric.\nStates might also choose to reference such assessments in their domestic prosecutions of the accused individuals. The United States, for example, has issued indictments against a number of foreign officials and others who use cyber operations to threaten U.S. national security.

Challenges Ahead\nDespite the promise an independent non-governmental attribution body like the Consortium holds for building international norms, challenges remain for the Consortium’s effective execution. If independence is a key feature, from what sources could it responsibly derive funding? How will such a body prioritize its investigations and how will it deliver results quickly enough to meet the need for timely response that victim states will face? Further, without traditional sources of intelligence at hand, how will such a body meet the need to connect an operator’s activity with state direction and control in the case of state-sponsored attacks?\nRAND suggests initial funding from philanthropic sources and the inclusion of a charter mandate to seek funding from the United Nations at a later point. RAND also points to the possibility of funding from cybersecurity and information technology companies that operate and defend much of the infrastructure upon which attacks are launched. This might not be so far-fetched: if the Consortium were able to build a strong reputation in the international community,\n Deeks, supra note 163.\n See supra note 115.\n Davis et al., RAND Corp., supra note 51, at 44.\n Id. at 45.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202\nLefebvre\nCracking Attribution\n\nIf it could be done transparently, this Note suggests another solution: the Consortium might even charge clients fees for attribution services, in accordance with their ability to pay, basing its schedule off of the United Nations’ scale of assessments for the apportionment of its expenses. Admittedly, this might introduce risks to its neutrality if the organization appears to demonstrate something akin to customer loyalty. If any attribution body were to accept fees for its services to offset its costs, its revenue streams would need to be diversified enough to prevent reliance on fees from any particular state, region, or global bloc.\nDeveloping prioritization policies may best be left to the discretion of the Consortium, given the variety of effects cyber attacks produce and the difficulty in organizing attacks by their severity. For example, the Consortium might be forced to choose between investigating a cyber attack that resulted in an explosion that killed tens of people or a ransomware attack that paralyzed the state’s ability to provide key services and cost its citizens and businesses hundreds of millions of dollars and maybe, indirectly, loss of life. In this case, one might suggest investigating the former first, since the victim state in that case would have suffered an armed attack under the effects test and would have the right to respond in self-defense, if such measures were necessary to prevent future attacks. However, one can imagine murkier cases where the severity might be tied to the degree of harm suffered by the victim. For example, two ostensibly different attacks on two different central bank accounts might result in the same amount of money lost, but one of\n Cf. G.A. Res. 70/245 (December 23, 2015) (detailing the U.N. scale of assessments).\n Cf. supra note 6–7 and accompanying text (detailing cyber attacks that either did or would have resulted in similar damage).\n Tallinn Manual 2.0, supra note 1, at 340–41.\n U.N. Charter, art. 51.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202\nLefebvre\nCracking Attribution\n\nEven if the Consortium were able to develop severity prioritization rules, the body might not be able to complete the investigation in a timely enough fashion for a state to respond. If a state continues to suffer armed attacks or uses of force, the victim might need to respond with self-defense measures under Article 51 or enact countermeasures in order to bring the culprit back into compliance with its international obligations. In such a situation, the Consortium might be able to release preliminary findings at a lower confidence level. Acting on any such findings could operate under a “buyer beware” framework, a concept that would tie nicely with the sliding-scale evidentiary framework proposed in Section I.C. Over time, international norms—and perhaps, eventually, customary international law—could be built around the level of confidence expected from attributional assessments before a state could pursue countermeasures, invoke pleas of necessity, or undertake acts of self-defense. The Consortium’s findings would make the adoption of this sliding-scale evidentiary framework more easily possible, since the findings would provide a quantifiable, standardized, and easily referenced confidence level for the international community to debate. Over time, this transparency could help develop international law’s standards of proof by providing more transparent examples of state practice, leading to easier identification of the *opinio juris* needed to locate customary international law. For example, one might find, after mapping the Consortium’s confidence levels of its attribution assessments to the corresponding state responses, that states are only willing to enact countermeasures on confidence levels of fifty percent or higher and self-defense measures on confidence levels of seventy-five percent or higher.\n See supra note 109–111 and accompanying text.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202\nLefebvre\nCracking Attribution\n\nPerhaps the most significant challenge facing the Consortium is the ostensibly low likelihood that competing tech companies would come together to participate in the organization. But there are reasons to think that prominent players in the tech sector would be more interested than some might suppose.

The tech sector plays a unique role as the internet's first responders, and we therefore should commit ourselves to collective action that will make the internet a safer place, affirming a role as a neutral Digital Switzerland that assists customers everywhere and retains the world's trust.\nSmith has gone to great lengths in an attempt to operationalize this principle, by leading the campaign to sign on more than thirty tech firms to the “Cybersecurity Tech Accord,” including Cisco, Dell, Facebook, FireEye, HP, Symantec, and Oracle. The accord’s principles commit the signatories to supporting civil society, governments, and international organizations in advancing and building cybersecurity capacity to protect against offensive cyber operations, among other goals that would align with the driving principles behind organizing the Consortium. While the accord is still young, its existence is a helpful indication of the tech sector’s thinking on these issues, and it suggests that the possibility of an investigative body like the Consortium is more greater than it appears on its face.\n Brad Smith Takes His Call for a Digital Geneva Convention to the United Nations, Microsoft: Microsoft On the Issues (Nov. 7, 2017), https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2017/11/09/brad-smith-takes-call-digital-geneva-convention-united-nations/.\n Sam Meredith, Microsoft Calls for ‘New Digital Geneva Convention’ after Spate of High-Profile Cyberattacks, CNBC (Jan. 26, 2018), https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/26/microsoft-calls-for-new-digital-geneva-convention-after-spate-of-high-profile-cyberattacks.html\n Brad Smith, The Need for a Digital Geneva Convention, Microsoft: Microsoft on the Issues (Feb. 14, 2017), https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2017/02/14/need-digital-geneva-convention/#sm.0001hkfw5aob5evwum620jqwsabzv.\n David Sanger, Tech Firms Sign “Digital Geneva Accord” Not to Aid Governments in Cyberwar, N.Y.

While multilateral treaties and international cooperation might be the preferred avenue to overcome them, current trends provide little hope for the success of such options. Despite this, the development of customary international law provides an opportunity to push forward in regulating state behavior surrounding cyberspace. This Note demonstrates how an attributional body like the Consortium stands to provide substantial benefit to the development of these norms by providing states with a transparent and independent mechanism upon which to build evidentiary standards, such as the sliding-scale evidentiary framework, to undergird countermeasures and acts of self-defense. In this way, the international community can make more consistent judgments about state action in response to offensive cyber operations. While this may provide less flexibility for states to act in the face of such operations than what is nearly guaranteed through today's system of opaque unilateral evidentiary assessments, such restrictions on state behavior would benefit the international community at large by increasing global stability. Further, adopting this Note's version of a sliding-scale approach to the standard of proof—one where the standard fluctuates based on the response a victim wishes to undertake—should accommodate the flexibility states need when attempting to respond to quickly to a cyber attack.\nBy offering both victim states and the accused the opportunity to obtain an independent, sophisticated, and quantifiable attributional assessment, a body like the Consortium could help alleviate the deterrence difficulties inherent in a low-confidence attribution landscape and reduce the risk that states escalate or begin conflicts with parties that have no relation to the conflict. Questions persist regarding sources of funding for the Consortium, its operational efficiency in light of the need for quick responses to severe offensive operations, and the remaining difficulty\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202\nLefebvre\nCracking Attribution\n\nWhatever the case, the world will not stand still in the cyber landscape. If international law is to be of any value in restricting dangerous state behavior in this arena, its development must push forward. States can still do their part to gradually advance international norms by responsibly conducting their own cyber practices and related behavior in an effort to shape customary international law. An independent non-governmental attributional body like the Consortium provides a powerful launchpad for them to do just that.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202",

It indicates that cyber operations are attributable to the latter state so long as it is exercising government authority over the former state’s organ.¹¹⁹ Rule 17 deals with state control of non-state actors. It identifies that the state is responsible for those cyber operations committed by non-state actors that it directs, controls, or that the state acknowledges and adopts as its own, reflecting the concept of “effective control” articulated in the Nicaragua case.¹²⁰ Rule 18 deals with a state’s responsibility for the cyber operations of foreign states, concluding that one state bears responsibility for another’s cyber operation when, knowing of the act’s wrongful character, it either coerces, aids or assists, or directs and controls that state in the operation.¹²¹ As a result of the distributed nature of the Internet, the second Tallinn Manual took the view that geography is of little importance into inquiries of state responsibility.¹²² Instead, the inquiry is almost entirely grounded in the instruction received and control exercised by any given state.¹²³",

This is in part because the United States takes an “effects” view the term “cyber weapon,” rather than seeing them as a class of tools that are identifiable as weapons in and of themselves. That is to say, the United States considers a cyber tool a weapon based on the effects of its use rather than based on the nature of its architecture. This may be driven by differences in how the United States, Russia, and China view “information” as a threat to national security.

      "flat_text": "# CRACKING ATTRIBUTION: MOVING INTERNATIONAL NORMS FORWARD\nJoshua Lefebvre\nThis Note addresses how international law can meet the challenge of reliably and transparently identifying the actor responsible for a cyber attack, a feature of the cyber landscape referred to as the “attribution problem.” It examines the potential for customary international law to define evidentiary standards for evaluating claims of a cyber attacker’s identity, standards which would have to be met before a state victim could retaliate. Such a framework would replace the malleable and opaque ad hoc determinations of responsibility that states currently undertake in both the conventional force and the cyber contexts alike. To this end, this Note introduces a sliding-scale evidentiary standard that adapts to the—often limited—availability of evidence and short amount of time a victim might have to respond to cyber attacks.\nThis Note analogizes to attribution problems faced by the international community in the past, such as piracy and privateering on the eighteenth century’s high seas, to demonstrate that the legal problems posed by cyber capabilities are not unfamiliar. But the ubiquity of cyber capabilities and diffuse nature of the cyber landscape mean that the solution must be different. This Note demonstrates that a newly proposed non-governmental attribution body, structured like a tribunal, could meet the tremendous need many victims face in gathering the evidence to overcome the attribution problem inherent to cyberspace. Such a body, this Note argues, provides the best launchpad for developing the international norms—and, eventually, the customary international law—needed to build evidentiary standards in the cyber context.\nINTRODUCTION ... 1\nI.

Treaties dealing directly with cyber operations are scarce in number and limited in scope. State cyber practices are held close to the chest and, although their publicly available expressions are increasing, there are still too few to constitute well-defined norms to develop comprehensive customary international law. While it at least seems clear today that existing principles of international law apply in cyberspace, states—perhaps as a result of their own strategic caution—have, at present, left to the academy and non-governmental bodies much of the task of determining how such principles apply. Against this hazy legal backdrop, states and non-state actors alike have wasted no time in deploying cyber attacks and exploitations of ever more destructive and exploitative power. In June 2017, according to the U.S. government, the Russian military launched “the most destructive and costly cyber attack in history,” using ransomware dubbed “NotPetya” to cause billions of dollars in damage across Europe, the Americas, and Asia. Just two months later, in August 2017, a petrochemical plant in Saudi Arabia suffered a cyber attack that was designed to trigger an explosion that likely\n Introduction to International Governmental Group of Experts, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations 3 (Michael N.

Most notably, the first and second Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations, written by the International Group of Experts (“IGE”), have proven to be influential in detailing how international principles apply to cyberspace and, in particular, their application to cyber warfare. But even where consensus can be built around which principles of international law apply to cyberspace, a key roadblock remains toward much of their implementation. Namely, the application of state responsibility principles remains difficult—if not impossible—where victims cannot reliably and transparently identify the actor responsible or, worse, if the attacker’s identity remains unknown.

It then explores the evidentiary framework by which attribution claims in both the conventional and cyber context are measured. In doing so, it attempts to identify and help fill the gap in the academic literature surrounding what standards of proof are and should be expected to be met under international law. Toward this end, it introduces a novel application of a sliding scale of proof, one tied to the severity of the victim’s response rather than solely to the underlying breach of international law. Part I then concludes by providing a brief overview of how principles of state responsibility apply in cyberspace.\nPart II identifies a number of the proposed solutions to the attribution problem suggested in the literature—such as intergovernmental inspection and compliance bodies as well as multilateral treaties—and explains why they are inadequate in the cyber context or are unlikely to come about. It then critiques and builds upon the solution highlighted by this Note: a non-governmental global consortium of representatives from private companies, academia, and think tanks that assesses available forensic evidence to provide an attributional assessment for victims of cyber attack or exploitation. But the value of this organization does not just lie in its ability to provide a much-needed leader for neutral and capable technical investigations. Rather, it has significant potential to lay the groundwork for the proposed sliding-scale evidentiary framework’s\n See Waxman, supra note 4, at 426.\n While this Note recognizes the benefits of solutions that propose an intergovernmental organization to govern cyber capability use and compliance, akin to the International Atomic Energy Agency (“IAEA”), see, e.g., Scott Charney et al., Microsoft Corp., From Articulation to Implementation: Enabling Progress on Cybersecurity Norms 11 (2016), it also recognizes that states are highly unlikely in today’s toxic geopolitical environment to agree to allow representatives from foreign governments to inspect some of their most closely held secrets. Further, significant doubts might arise as to the neutrality of governmental representatives serving in the body’s management and operational roles, risking the legitimacy and independence of the body’s assessments.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202\nLefebvre\nCracking Attribution\n\nRather than have states judge for themselves how much proof is necessary to respond to an attack, this Note argues that states might feel obligated to justify their actions in the face of a quantifiable confidence metric, one that could be provided by the proposed non-governmental attribution body. Through reference to the attributional assessment of a neutral and sophisticated body, a state's self-defense and countermeasure activities could rest on a firmer and more transparent evidentiary foundation. In this way, this Note makes the novel suggestion that this non-governmental organization could serve as the best launchpad for developing customary international law to build evidentiary standards in the cyber context.\n## I. DEFINING THE ATTRIBUTION PROBLEM AND ITS SCOPE\nThe attribution problem is often viewed as a technical challenge with a technical solution: the tools of offensive cyber operations make it easy to hide one's identity from a victim, so would-be victims need to build cyber defensive capabilities and cyber forensic investigative capabilities to overcome this challenge. But the limitations of cyber defensive and investigative capabilities can and do pose obstacles to the application of international law. Principally, they foreground the question of how a state could respond lawfully under international law if it does not know against whom it should respond. The immensity of this problem, however, overshadows the subsequent\n See infra note 78 and accompanying text.\n This Note keys the term “self-defense” to its meaning under Article 51 of the U.N. Charter, limiting it to a victim state’s uses of force taken against an aggressor state in response to an armed attack. U.N. Charter, art. 51.\n In this Note, the term “countermeasures” is used as a term of art. It refers to actions taken by a victim state that amount to a breach of its international obligations vis-à-vis an aggressor state. Such actions must be taken with the goal of bringing the aggressor state back into compliance with its international obligations vis-à-vis the victim state and cannot exceed what is necessary and proportionate to effectuate that goal. Without the preceding act of aggression, these actions would otherwise be considered unlawful. Int’l. L. Comm’n, Rep. on the Work of its Fifty-Third Session, U.N. Doc. A/56/10, at 128–31 (2001).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202\nLefebvre\nCracking Attribution\n\nThis Part addresses both of these obstacles. It demonstrates why reliable, standardized, and transparent determinations of a cyber attacker’s identity—referred to throughout this Note as “attributional assessments” or “attributional claims”—are necessary to the successful application of international law’s principles to cyberspace, and it evaluates how customary international law could be developed to meet this end. Toward this effort, Section I.C addresses a relative gap in the literature by assessing what standard of proof is and should be necessary when making an attributional claim.\nFor the purposes of this Note, “attribution” is tied to identity, rather than an action’s particular cause. In this context, attribution refers to the process of determining the “identity or location of an attacker or an attacker’s intermediary.” To qualify as an interstate attributional claim, the identity of the attack or exploitation’s independent operators must be connected with customary international law’s principles of state responsibility, largely reflected in the second Tallinn Manual and discussed in Section I.D. Ultimately, once the technical assessment of the\n Waxman, supra note 4, at 426 (“[T]he low visibility of states’ moves and countermoves in cyberspace will slow the process of interpretive development . . . . Article 2(4) will probably be a weak constraint on offensive cyber-attacks because of, among other reasons, the difficulty of observing them and attributing them to their sources or sponsors . . . . Those weaknesses will . . . likely plague any attempt to negotiate and enforce new international agreements limiting cyber-warfare.”).\n David D.

Conventional Parallels\nThe difficulty in linking attacks to the identity of the attacker is not a new problem for international law: states have struggled with making such determinations for centuries. This is true where another state has been the attacker, where a non-state actor acting under its own direction has been the attacker, and where state proxies acting under the direction of a sponsoring state have been the source of the attacks. Some commentators have drawn parallels between today’s challenges in policing cyberspace to those created by the state use of privateers on the high seas in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Florian Egloff notes how both the high seas through that period and cyberspace involve a range of actors, each with varying degrees of direction and control from a sponsoring state. Between these two different eras and environments, the parallels between state actors, semi-state actors, and non-state actors can be readily drawn: respectively, consider the similarities between formal navies and cyber military units, privateers and today’s “patriotic hackers,” or even pirates and most modern cybercriminals or cybercrime organizations.\n See infra note 66.\n Florian Egloff, Cybersecurity and the Age of Privateering, in Understanding Cyber Conflict: 14 Analogies 231, (George Perkovich &amp; Ariel E. Levite eds., 2017); Noah Schachtman &amp; Peter W. Singer, The Wrong War: The Insistence on Applying Cold War Metaphors to Cybersecurity is Misplaced and Counterproductive, Brookings (August 15, 2011), https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-wrong-war-the-insistence-on-applying-cold-war-metaphors-to-cybersecurity-is-misplaced-and-counterproductive/.\n Florian Egloff, Cybersecurity and the Ague of Privateering, in Understanding Cyber Conflict: 14 Analogies, supra note 24, at 238–39.\n The term “patriotic hackers” is a reference to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s suggestion that “patriotically minded” private Russian hackers, but not the Russian government or its organs, could have been the operators behind the 2016 cyber exploitation of the U.S. Democratic National Committee’s servers.

Charter’s prohibition on the use of force. This came about in large part from the transition from conventional war-making to “unconventional [and] low-intensity conflict [that] featured inconclusive evidence of foreign involvement or hostile action, and foreign state antagonists [who] worked to mask, conceal, or obscure their participation and responses.” As with today’s cyber attacks and exploitations, “once\n Carl J.

Armed Servs. Comm., 115th Cong. 8 (2017) (statement of Jack Reed, U.S. Senator from Rhode Island) (suggesting that because detection and attribution of the attacks on the Democratic National Committee were not very difficult, it leads to the inference that Russia only wanted enough plausible deniability to support “an official rejection of culpability”).\n See Kulsrud, supra note 28, at 158.\n Gary M.

The parallels, however, highlight the international legal problems posed when the identity of an attacker is uncertain. While technical attribution capabilities are increasing for many states, including the United States, the identification of the machine or machines used in carrying out the attack, their operators, or even the geographic locations of the machines and their operators is not always enough when making a determination of state responsibility. Yet the stakes are high. If the injured state responds to a wrongful act under international law with a countermeasure aimed at a wrongly accused state, then the injured state has then committed an internationally wrongful act by engaging in countermeasures against an innocent state. Simply put, the international legal framework currently in place for responding to uses of force, armed attacks, and other breaches of international obligations cannot function properly without reliable attributional assessments, regardless of whether the unlawful action occurs in the context of a cyber or a traditional physical operation.\n Id.\n See Banks, supra note 2, at 1493 (describing some of the technical challenges posed by cyber attacks and exploitations).\n Banks, supra note 2, at 1502.

These two components comprise factual inquiries, of course, into what machines were used to carry out an attack, who operated them, and who directed or controlled those operators for purposes of the operation.\nAt the most basic level, an offensive cyber operation involves one or more individuals, often acting remotely, who interfaces with one or more computers or entire networks—usually by means of programming code—in order to gain access to the targeted systems through hardware or software security vulnerabilities or through fraudulent credentials. Once the operation’s conductors have gained access to the desired system, they attempt to take advantage of the system to plant code, known as malware, that will destroy or degrade the intruded system, exfiltrate information from the system, or both.\nCyber operations pose significant and unique challenges in the evidentiary context as it relates to both the identity of the operator and attribution to a state. This is in part because the operations are “opaque to public view, technically very complex and likely to emerge piecemeal,” unlike conventional kinetic attacks, which are visible and “can be and often are broadcast widely, immediately, and understandably [and, further, the] common experience [of such attacks] makes\n See Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua (Nicar. v.

For example, in 2015, the French-language television network TV5Monde saw its networks attacked by an organization that made references to a “Cyber Caliphate” and “Je suis IS,” leading to an initial attribution to Islamic State. After further investigation, however, the attack appeared to be a false flag: FireEye and the National Cybersecurity Agency of France found leads that traced back to a highly sophisticated Russian group labelled by cybersecurity firms as, among other names, “Advanced Persistent Threat 28,” “Fancy Bear,” and “Sofacy.” The group is believed to have ties to the Russian government and is considered to have played a role in the cyber operation against the Democratic National Committee in 2016 and against the German Bundestag in 2015.\n1.

States often meet the shortcomings of forensic technical analysis with signals intelligence (\"SIGINT\") and human intelligence (\"HUMINT\") resources. In the case of SIGINT, this includes methods such as collection of the content or metadata from phone records, emails, and other communications. HUMINT includes sources such as interviews with recruited foreign agents. Despite the private sector's incredible technical forensics capabilities—which can rival that of states in terms of its technical capacity to identify offensive cyber operators—some of these more traditional sources of intelligence are unavailable to even the most sophisticated cybersecurity firms. While Symantec, Kaspersky, FireEye, CrowdStrike, and others may have an incredible talent pool and significant financial resources, they do not \"control the wires\" nor can they deploy on-the-ground espionage operations to develop critical intelligence to help implicate responsible states or better ascertain the identities of operators.\nBut even those states that are able to meet the factual challenge of identifying an attacker with a high degree of confidence are often unwilling to release much of the evidence on which\n See supra notes 49–55 and accompanying text (discussing the offensive cyber operation against TV5Monde).\n See Cyber Warfare in the 21st Century: Threats, Challenges, and Opportunities: Hearing Before the H.

Is There an Attribution Standard for Cyberspace Under International Law?\nIn the cyber context, the answers to the evidentiary questions are even more underdeveloped due to the paucity of transparent state practice and *opinio juris*—a term that refers to a state’s sense of legal obligation—in making public attributional statements for offensive cyber operations. In its 2015 report, the U.N. Group of Governmental Experts acknowledged that attribution claims for cyber operations “should be substantiated.” But the report failed to articulate how much or what type of evidence is necessary for states to justify countermeasures or acts of self-defense under international law, or even whether such claims must be substantiated publicly. The United States has gone one step further in articulating its position on the matter in remarks made in November 2016 by then-U.S. Department of State Legal Adviser Brian Egan:\n See Tallinn Manual 2.0, supra note 1, at 83. In order to establish customary international law, there must be a history of state practice driven by a sense of legal obligation, referred to as *opinion juris*.\n Rep. of the Group of Governmental Experts on Devs. in the Field of Info. and Telecomms. in the Context of Int’l Security, transmitted by Letter Dated 26 June 2015 from Deborah Stokes (Chair of the Group), U.N.

The commentary accompanying the Draft Articles on State Responsibility notes:\nIn a bilateral dispute over State responsibility, the onus of establishing responsibility lies in principle on the claimant State. Where conduct in conflict with an international obligation is attributable to a State and that State seeks to avoid its responsibility by relying on a circumstance under chapter V [which describes circumstances precluding wrongfulness], however, the position changes and the onus lies on that State to justify or excuse its conduct.\nThis is echoed in the ICJ’s judgment in the *Oil Platforms* case. In that case, the ICJ indicated that the United States bore the burden of proving that Iranian forces fired a missile at the *Sea Isle City*, a Kuwaiti tanker reflagged to the United States, which had made a defensive claim for which it used this evidence as the factual basis.\n Banks, supra note 2, at 1507; see Cyber Warfare in the 21st Century: Threats, Challenges, and Opportunities: Hearing Before the H.

Nor does it seem that states carry a well-defined burden under international law related to the quality or amount of evidence used in proving an attributional claim before undertaking acts of self-defense or countermeasures against the accused state. Further, strikingly few commentators have even addressed the issue of evidentiary burdens under international law. But despite the IGE’s findings and the claims that states like the United States have made about (non-)obligations under international law, there is a contingent of those few who have argued the contrary. Such commentators claim that sufficient state practice exists to locate the standard of proof required of attribution claims.\nProfessor Mary Ellen O’Connell has argued that, at least in situations in which states are justifying the use of force under Article 51’s self-defense provision, state practice and the decisions of international courts and tribunals support a “clear and convincing” standard in evaluating evidence. She claims that “the international authority for the standard consists of several\n See also Banks, supra note 2, at 1499 (“Applying the Rules on State Responsibility and attribution compiled in Tallinn 2.0, there is no burden of proof or requirement that there exists definitive information on attribution.

State practice on its own is insufficient to establish customary international law; it is only when it is done out of a sense of legal obligation, or *opinio juris*, that it can be considered customary international law. Further, the fact that she only cites U.S. practice draws into question whether one state’s practice is enough, even if the United States were acting out of a sense of legal obligation. Lastly, the United States and any number of other states have a multitude of political reasons to indicate that they are in possession of “clear” or “convincing” evidence. There is no suggestion that such states believe that this is an evidentiary floor that must be met under international law before they can act on the evidence in their possession.\n O’Connell, supra note 31, at 23–28.\n But see Mark Landler &amp; Michael R.

Indeed, the ICJ’s proceedings only require enough proof to “satisfy” the ICJ in law and in fact, a rather flexible standard. Conceivably, as the ICJ suggested in its decision in the Nicaragua case, the ICJ may find itself satisfied with applying different standards of proof in different contexts, depending on the amount of evidence available or the difficulty in proving particular claims. This makes it even more difficult to make an inference about the standard it is using to judge the facts before it. Particularly since there is little state practice and no apparent opinio juris to support a standard of proof for state attribution claims against other states for a breach of an international obligation, any inferences about the standard of proof used by the ICJ appear to be cabined to that international body. This only becomes clearer when one considers that the ICJ derives its power to set a standard of proof from its foundational statute. It is not derived from principles of customary international law or some other species of international law that has broad impact\n Case Concerning Oil Platforms (Islamic Republic of Iran v.

The Value of a Sliding-Scale Attribution Standard\nThe absence of a standard of proof in these matters may be surprising, but it is likely—at least in part—a reflection of the reluctance among nations to share closely guarded intelligence methods on a global stage in front of ally and adversary alike. There is little doubt, however, that developing international norms to establish a standard of proof for attributional claims before undertaking countermeasures or self-defense measures would force states to exercise restraint in using these tools. One would hope that such restraint could help prevent conflicts from escalating or even spilling over into wrongly accused states that had no previous role in a particular conflict. Problems arise, though, in determining how high such a standard should be for cyber operations, given the difficulty many states face in being able to make an attributional claim with a high degree of confidence in a short amount of time. Any standard of proof employed should be sufficiently flexible to allow a state to act quickly enough for its countermeasures to serve as an adequate means of forcing the offending state back into compliance with its international\n See Statute of the International Court of Justice, June 26, 1945, art. 53(2), 59 Stat. 1055, 1062, T.S. No. 993.\n The reluctance, of course, is not unfounded. Sharing intelligence with adversaries can better clue them into the methods of the victim state’s intelligence collection, helping adversaries to better identify their own security vulnerabilities. For one example of how providing intelligence can change an adversary’s behavior in a way that threatens a state’s national security, see Eric Schmitt &amp; Michael S. Schmidt, *Queda Plot Leak Has Undermined U.S. Intelligence*, N.Y.

For example, the victim state might only need to find on the balance of evidence that a particular state is responsible for an offensive cyber operation if deploying countermeasures, such as the violation of a treaty between the victim and aggressor states, but it may need clear-and-convincing evidence to respond with a use of armed force. This proposal falls in line with the second Tallinn Manual’s suggestion that “the greater the underlying breach . . . the greater the confidence ought to be in the evidence relied upon by a State considering a response” since the “robustness of permissible self-help responses grows commensurately with the seriousness of the breach.” For example, a state should be more confident in its attribution when it responds with armed force to a cyber attack on an air traffic control system that resulted in aircraft accidents and fatalities. The same should be expected if it were to suffer an attack on the underground pump controllers for an underground rail system that resulted in major flooding and destruction of its infrastructure. If a state were to suffer a denial of service attack on the website of a regulatory agency that issues permits for hunting and fishing, however, principles of necessity and proportionality dictate that the victim state would only be permitted to respond with something\n Professors Christian Payne and Lorraine Finlay have proposed a standard of proof tied to the victim’s response, but they have failed to provide much detail other than suggesting victim states that “pursue peaceful, legal processes” for resolving disputes related to cyber operations should “have the benefit of eschewing stringent attribution tests normally required.” Payne &amp; Finlay, supra note 5, at 567. In such cases, they suggest strict liability for those states that the victim state believes to be the host states for the attack. Id. at 566–67. They do not discuss the standard of proof necessary to undertake countermeasures and argue that the “effective control” standard is required for self-defense measures. Id.; see also infra note 132 and accompanying text (discussing the “effective control” standard).\n Tallinn Manual 2.0, supra note 1, at 82 (citing Oil Platforms, 2003 I.C.J. at ¶ 67 (separate opinion of Judge Higgins)).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202\nLefebvre\nCracking Attribution\n\nUnder a shifting standard of proof for attributional claims, a state could respond to the first two examples with countermeasures if it perhaps only had probable cause that a given state had conducted the attacks. After acquiring evidence to prove its attributional claim at a higher standard of proof, such as clear-and-convincing evidence, a state could respond with armed force if it were to conclude that such force would be proportional and necessary to repel the attack or later attacks. This shifting standard of proof does not change the ultimate severity ceiling of the response available to the victim state, which is still tied to the underlying breach and governed by principles of proportionality and necessity; rather, it adapts the severity of the response to the standard of proof that the victim state is able to meet at any given point. This would allow victim states to respond—at least in some fashion—more quickly, and thereby more effectively, to offensive cyber operations than if a higher evidentiary threshold were required uniformly among all types of responses. Victim states, of course, could still increase the severity of their responses as needed to force the attacking state back into compliance with its international obligations, so long as the certainty in the attacker’s identity correspondingly increased.\nAdmittedly, such a standard might result in more severe and more frequent state responses against less sophisticated actors—who lack the ability to hide the evidence that leads to their identity—than sophisticated actors. But this is no different than any other system that requires evidentiary burdens to be met before responsive measures can be taken: even in domestic criminal\n See infra note 113.\n International Governmental Group of Experts, Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare 61 (Michael N. Schmitt ed., 2013).\n While outside the scope of this Note, there is no reason why such a standard could not be tied to any use of force, whether it be conventional or cyber. Indeed, there is a colorable argument that it would be wise to apply such a standard beyond the cyber context, particularly given the ad hoc factual evaluation of conventional use of force events and their associated attribution problems.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202\nLefebvre\nCracking Attribution\n\nPart II further explores how evaluations of such evidence could be more publicly accountable by allowing states to submit their claims to a neutral body that would provide an attributional assessment of the offensive cyber operation, including a forensic report and a confidence judgment as to the culprit. It also examines how such a body could contribute to the creation of international norms—and, eventually, customary international law—that integrate this sliding-scale evidentiary framework and which make it clear what standard of proof a state should have to meet before responding with the use of force or countermeasures. In this way, the body could create a platform through which states could better define customary international law, even where attempts to build positive international law have stalled or failed.^[115]^\n## D. Frameworks for Assessing State Responsibility for Cyber Operations\nIn contrast with standards of proof, principles of state responsibility are far better defined under international law, thanks to the ICJ's jurisprudence and the International Law Commission's (\"ILC\") Articles on State Responsibility. As a result, the second Tallinn Manual provides far more guidance about principles of state responsibility as they relate to cyber operations, beginning with Tallinn Rule 14's threshold^[116]^: \"A State bears international responsibility for a cyber-related act\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202\nLefebvre\nCracking Attribution\n\n Tallinn Manual 2.0, supra note 1, at 84. The language “breach of an international legal obligation” is particularly important, since it does not include activities that are either unregulated by international law, such as cyber espionage and related intelligence gathering, or are expressly permitted, such as suspension of international cyber communication services within its territory.

Despite differences in what evidence is required, the evidentiary standard remains the same for each. Thus, in order to reach an attribution conclusion, the analysis developed in the previous Section should be applied not just to factual determinations that lead to the identities of individual cyber operators, but to factual determinations that lead to conclusions about state responsibility.\n## II.

Given the United States’ role in the international community and its strength in the cyber landscape, there is little hope of building a productive multilateral agreement without its support. But the United States’ preferred path forward has encountered its own roadblocks after the collapse of consensus among the U.N. Group of Governmental Experts on Information Security, a multilateral attempt to more firmly establish customary international law in the cyber context.\nSome, most notably Microsoft Corporation, the Atlantic Council, and the RAND Corporation, have called for the creation of an attributional organization that would investigate offensive cyber operations and provide assessments on the identity of the likely culprit or culprits.

This is in part because the United States takes an “effects” view the term “cyber weapon,” rather than seeing them as a class of tools that are identifiable as weapons in and of themselves. That is to say, the United States considers a cyber tool a weapon based on the effects of its use rather than based on the nature of its architecture. This may be driven by differences in how the United States, Russia, and China view “information” as a threat to national security.

Building a Private Body for a Public Good\nIn 2017, researchers at the RAND Corporation published a white paper proposing the creation of an attributional organization that would exclude states from its management and operation, referring to the proposed body as the “Global Cyber Attribution Consortium” (“the Consortium”). Instead of states, RAND proposes that the body be managed and operated by cyberspace legal and policy experts, international policy experts from academia and research organizations, and technical experts from academia as well as cybersecurity and information technology companies. RAND recognizes that these actors are not immune to politicization: they may face pressures from their home markets or states of incorporation, or they may inherently possess strong national loyalties. But such a body would at least be further removed from state political interests and face more political accountability at the international level, to the extent that the companies and research organizations involved conduct global operations. Most\n Davis et al., RAND Corp., supra note 51, at 31; see Efrony, supra note 133 (“None of the experts should be simultaneously employed by governmental institutions to avoid even the appearance of conflicts of interest.”).\n Davis et al., RAND Corp., supra note 51, at 31.\n Id at 27, 33. To be clear, by using the term “attribution organization,” the suggestion is that the organization engages exclusively in attributional assessments. Unlike the proposals suggested by Microsoft and the Atlantic Council, it has no enforcement function. See Charney, Microsoft Corp., supra note 12, at 11; Jason Healey, et al., Atlantic Council, Confidence-Building Measures in Cyberspace: A Multistakeholder Approach for Stability and Security 10 (2014).\n Davis et al., RAND Corp., supra note 51, at 29; see also Efrony, supra note 133 (supporting the idea of excluding states from a global attribution body).\n Admittedly, “global operations” does not mean such operations will be equal among all states. One might argue that states with more sophisticated technology sectors could have more influence over the Consortium than states with less sophisticated technology sectors, since such countries will likely have stronger ties to members of the Consortium. But given the wide network of global interests and partnerships that states with sophisticated technology sectors have, which often tie them to states with smaller technology sectors, it is unlikely that the Consortium could or would privilege states along this line. Consider, for example, Russia’s collaborative interests with Iran, or the United States’ strong relationship with Afghanistan. Given this, the more relevant distinction may be between those states with friends and those without.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202\nLefebvre\nCracking Attribution\n\nJust being further removed from the risk of politicization, however, is not enough. The nature of the organization’s work requires not only a better reputation for neutrality than what could be accomplished with an intergovernmental organization, but an incredibly strong reputation for neutrality and expertise. This would, at a minimum, require geographic diversity from each of the sectors represented and strict transparency in both its governance and evaluation methodologies and procedures. As RAND puts it, with no international norms to rely upon at present, the Consortium can only derive its legitimacy over time from “the reputation and credibility gained from the technical expertise of its diverse global membership and its commitment to objectivity and transparency in its attribution findings.”\nTo deliver on the promise of providing more reliable and transparent attributional assessments than what states have offered to date, the Consortium would need to include formalized conditions that trigger its review, standardized processes for evidence collection and assessment, attribution-confidence standards, procedures for notification and publication of results, and standardized procedures to assess the severity and sophistication of offensive operations. Indeed, standardization and transparency are two crucial elements missing from the current diffuse attribution regime. As discussed, because of the lack of clear evidentiary standards, states at present have little incentive to be transparent in their technical analysis. Further, even\n See Davis et al., RAND Corp., supra note 51, at 30.\n Id.\n Davis et al., RAND Corp., supra note 51, at 35.\n See supra Section I.C.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202\nLefebvre\nCracking Attribution\n\n See Davis et al., RAND Corp., supra note 51, at 20; Max Smeets, When Naming Cyber Threat Actors Does More Harm Than Good, Council on Foreign Relations: Blog (Oct. 24, 2016), https://www.cfr.org/blog/when-naming-cyber-threat-actors-does-more-harm-good (“First, if a competitor has already discovered a threat actor, the threat actor shouldn’t be renamed to fit another company’s branding. Even though renaming is in a firm’s interest to promote its brand, it sows confusion across the cybersecurity community and frustrates efforts to obtain accurate data on incidents and threat actors.”).\n The signatories to the Cybersecurity Tech Accord, discussed supra note 179 and accompanying text, has similarly endorsed cybersecurity standards.

While the Consortium would only begin an investigation at the request of the victim, the question remains, at least in some cases, as to which victim would have the proper standing to file a request with the Consortium. For example, if an electrical utility suffers an attack on its infrastructure, does the state retain exclusive rights to trigger the investigation and publicize the results or should the utility company have the ability to file an investigation request? RAND suggests leaving such decisions up to the discretion of the Consortium. But granting a private entity standing to bring an investigation request makes little sense, particularly given the consequences for the victim state if the operation were publicized and a state or non-state actor were accused. At the time of the request’s filing, there may be little clue as to the identity of the attacker. The risks of giving a private entity the right to publicize attacks and accuse another state with the Consortium’s platform and credibility behind its claim could cause significant difficulties for states in planning and conducting their international relations. While private entities may be hesitant to report attacks to their host states—particularly if they might be liable in some way for the intrusion—these concerns make it more prudent to favor giving states exclusive standing to bring the claim and to publicize the results.\n Id. at 39.\n Id.\n Id. at 36.\n Id.\n This concern resembles those that some have been expressed about claims made under the Alien Tort Statute and their potential to interfere with the foreign affairs of the United States. See Gary Clyde Hufbauer &amp; Nicholas K. Mitrokostas, Awakening Monster: The Alien Tort Statute of 1789 14 (2003); Robert Knowles, A Realist Defense of the Alien Tort Statute, 88 Wash. U. L. Rev. 1117, 1119–20 (2011).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202\nLefebvre\nCracking Attribution\n\n Even if the United States did not suffer a use of force or armed attack against its territorial integrity or political independence in this scenario, it was a victim of an Article 2(4) violation if one takes a somewhat broader conception of the provision. One state killing the nationals of another state would, at the very least, be activity “inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations.” U.N. Charter art. 2(4). Customary international law’s doctrine permitting the protection of nationals abroad seems to reflect that this is a sensible construction as does the principle of passive personality. See Restatement (Third) of the Foreign Relations Law of the U.S., § 402 cmt. g (Am. Law. Inst. 1987) (passive personality principle); Andrew W.R. Thomson, Doctrine of the Protection of Nationals Abroad: Rise of the Non-Combatant Evacuation Operation, 11 Wash. Univ. Global Studs. L.

Johnson &amp; Co. 1872) (“Whoever uses a citizen ill, indirectly offends the State, which is bound; to protect this citizen; and the sovereign of the latter should avenge his wrongs, punish the aggressor, and, if possible, oblige him to make full reparation; since otherwise the citizen would not obtain the great end of the civil association, which is, safety.”).\n Tallinn Manual 2.0, supra note 1, at 340–41.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202\nLefebvre\nCracking Attribution\n\nAt least in what might be expected in the typical case, where it is clear which state has both standing to bring the request and the right to publicize results, the Consortium’s work functions similarly to a pretrial hearing in the United States, where the Consortium acts as both factfinder and judge. While this is yet another area that the RAND proposal does not discuss with much depth, it would be sensible for the Consortium to provide the accused state with an advance copy of the Consortium’s report and an opportunity to rebut its conclusion and aspects of forensic report. This stage of the investigation could provide victim states with an opportunity to supplement the technical report from the Consortium’s forensic investigation with evidence gained through the victim state’s intelligence capabilities, such as from SIGINT and HUMINT, perhaps presenting such information to the Consortium in camera. To the extent a victim state is unwilling to share its intelligence with the Consortium, the only cost would be a lower confidence level in the attribution assessment than the Consortium would otherwise be able to provide. Alternatively, the Consortium might be able to release its forensic report and confidence assessment of the identity of the individual operators but provide a no-confidence or low-confidence assessment of state responsibility. Such a report would, at the very least, be valuable if the victim state chose to indict the operators under its domestic criminal law.\n See, e.g., Press Release, U.S. Dep’t of Justice, North Korean Regime-Backed Programmer Charged with Conspiracy to Conduct Multiple Cyber Attacks and Intrusions (Sept. 6, 2018), https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/north-korean-regime-backed-programmer-charged-conspiracy-conduct-multiple-cyber-attacks-and.

Further, in the investigations it would accept, its technical capabilities could still help to fill the evidentiary gap that states face in justifying countermeasures or self-defense, especially where the victim state’s technical capabilities are lacking.\nTo the extent that states are able to point to an independent body’s declassified cyber forensic investigation, a state’s justification for countermeasures would be built on firmer factual ground than if it only had its classified intelligence to rely upon. With a reduced ability to hide behind a claim of pretextual or false accusation, states might exercise more caution in conducting offensive cyber operations or might restrict themselves to low-level uses of force so as not to draw attention of the Consortium. This is true whether or not key players in the international community choose to submit a case to the Consortium. One may expect that the United States, China, Israel, or Russia may at first feel more comfortable relying upon the technical sophistication of their own intelligence communities to reliably identify culprits and might reject opening up the process to an independent body. But unlike with the political backing needed in a multilateral treaty, the Consortium could still provide much-needed technical assistance to less sophisticated middle-power and developing states that are targets of cyber attacks and exploitations, without the\nConducting Coordinated Campaign of Cyber Attacks Against U.S. Financial Sector (March 24, 2016), https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/seven-iranians-working-islamic-revolutionary-guard-corps-affiliated-entities-charged; Press Release, U.S. Dep’t Justice, U.S. Charges Five Chinese Military Hackers for Cyber Espionage Against U.S. Corporations and a Labor Organization for Commercial Advantage, (May 19, 2014), https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/us-charges-five-chinese-military-hackers-cyber-espionage-against-us-corporations-and-labor.\n At least part of the blame for the difficulties of deterring offensive cyber operations lies with the challenges in reliably attributing the operations to the correct culprit.

By tracking how states choose to respond to cyber attacks or exploitations and connecting those responses to the confidence level provided in the Consortium’s assessment, one might find that international norms develop around the amount of proof necessary before states feel it is permissible to respond. Rather than have states act as their own judges of how much proof is necessary to respond to an attack, states might feel they are obligated to justify their actions in the face of a quantifiable confidence metric.\nStates might also choose to reference such assessments in their domestic prosecutions of the accused individuals. The United States, for example, has issued indictments against a number of foreign officials and others who use cyber operations to threaten U.S. national security. If other states had access to similar technical resources to attribute attacks with a high enough degree\n See U.N. Secretary-General, Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security 18, U.N. Doc.

Challenges Ahead\nDespite the promise an independent non-governmental attribution body like the Consortium holds for building international norms, challenges remain for the Consortium’s effective execution. If independence is a key feature, from what sources could it responsibly derive funding? How will such a body prioritize its investigations and how will it deliver results quickly enough to meet the need for timely response that victim states will face? Further, without traditional sources of intelligence at hand, how will such a body meet the need to connect an operator’s activity with state direction and control in the case of state-sponsored attacks?\nRAND suggests initial funding from philanthropic sources and the inclusion of a charter mandate to seek funding from the United Nations at a later point. RAND also points to the possibility of funding from cybersecurity and information technology companies that operate and defend much of the infrastructure upon which attacks are launched. This might not be so far-fetched: if the Consortium were able to build a strong reputation in the international community,\n Deeks, supra note 163.\n See supra note 115.\n Davis et al., RAND Corp., supra note 51, at 44.\n Id. at 45.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202\nLefebvre\nCracking Attribution\n\nIf it could be done transparently, this Note suggests another solution: the Consortium might even charge clients fees for attribution services, in accordance with their ability to pay, basing its schedule off of the United Nations’ scale of assessments for the apportionment of its expenses. Admittedly, this might introduce risks to its neutrality if the organization appears to demonstrate something akin to customer loyalty. If any attribution body were to accept fees for its services to offset its costs, its revenue streams would need to be diversified enough to prevent reliance on fees from any particular state, region, or global bloc.\nDeveloping prioritization policies may best be left to the discretion of the Consortium, given the variety of effects cyber attacks produce and the difficulty in organizing attacks by their severity. For example, the Consortium might be forced to choose between investigating a cyber attack that resulted in an explosion that killed tens of people or a ransomware attack that paralyzed the state’s ability to provide key services and cost its citizens and businesses hundreds of millions of dollars and maybe, indirectly, loss of life. In this case, one might suggest investigating the former first, since the victim state in that case would have suffered an armed attack under the effects test and would have the right to respond in self-defense, if such measures were necessary to prevent future attacks. However, one can imagine murkier cases where the severity might be tied to the degree of harm suffered by the victim. For example, two ostensibly different attacks on two different central bank accounts might result in the same amount of money lost, but one of\n Cf. G.A. Res. 70/245 (December 23, 2015) (detailing the U.N. scale of assessments).\n Cf. supra note 6–7 and accompanying text (detailing cyber attacks that either did or would have resulted in similar damage).\n Tallinn Manual 2.0, supra note 1, at 340–41.\n U.N. Charter, art. 51.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202\nLefebvre\nCracking Attribution\n\nEven if the Consortium were able to develop severity prioritization rules, the body might not be able to complete the investigation in a timely enough fashion for a state to respond. If a state continues to suffer armed attacks or uses of force, the victim might need to respond with self-defense measures under Article 51 or enact countermeasures in order to bring the culprit back into compliance with its international obligations. In such a situation, the Consortium might be able to release preliminary findings at a lower confidence level. Acting on any such findings could operate under a “buyer beware” framework, a concept that would tie nicely with the sliding-scale evidentiary framework proposed in Section I.C. Over time, international norms—and perhaps, eventually, customary international law—could be built around the level of confidence expected from attributional assessments before a state could pursue countermeasures, invoke pleas of necessity, or undertake acts of self-defense. The Consortium’s findings would make the adoption of this sliding-scale evidentiary framework more easily possible, since the findings would provide a quantifiable, standardized, and easily referenced confidence level for the international community to debate. Over time, this transparency could help develop international law’s standards of proof by providing more transparent examples of state practice, leading to easier identification of the *opinio juris* needed to locate customary international law. For example, one might find, after mapping the Consortium’s confidence levels of its attribution assessments to the corresponding state responses, that states are only willing to enact countermeasures on confidence levels of fifty percent or higher and self-defense measures on confidence levels of seventy-five percent or higher.\n See supra note 109–111 and accompanying text.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202\nLefebvre\nCracking Attribution\n\nPerhaps the most significant challenge facing the Consortium is the ostensibly low likelihood that competing tech companies would come together to participate in the organization.

While multilateral treaties and international cooperation might be the preferred avenue to overcome them, current trends provide little hope for the success of such options. Despite this, the development of customary international law provides an opportunity to push forward in regulating state behavior surrounding cyberspace. This Note demonstrates how an attributional body like the Consortium stands to provide substantial benefit to the development of these norms by providing states with a transparent and independent mechanism upon which to build evidentiary standards, such as the sliding-scale evidentiary framework, to undergird countermeasures and acts of self-defense. In this way, the international community can make more consistent judgments about state action in response to offensive cyber operations. While this may provide less flexibility for states to act in the face of such operations than what is nearly guaranteed through today's system of opaque unilateral evidentiary assessments, such restrictions on state behavior would benefit the international community at large by increasing global stability. Further, adopting this Note's version of a sliding-scale approach to the standard of proof—one where the standard fluctuates based on the response a victim wishes to undertake—should accommodate the flexibility states need when attempting to respond to quickly to a cyber attack.\nBy offering both victim states and the accused the opportunity to obtain an independent, sophisticated, and quantifiable attributional assessment, a body like the Consortium could help alleviate the deterrence difficulties inherent in a low-confidence attribution landscape and reduce the risk that states escalate or begin conflicts with parties that have no relation to the conflict. Questions persist regarding sources of funding for the Consortium, its operational efficiency in light of the need for quick responses to severe offensive operations, and the remaining difficulty\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202\nLefebvre\nCracking Attribution\n\nWhatever the case, the world will not stand still in the cyber landscape. If international law is to be of any value in restricting dangerous state behavior in this arena, its development must push forward. States can still do their part to gradually advance international norms by responsibly conducting their own cyber practices and related behavior in an effort to shape customary international law. An independent non-governmental attributional body like the Consortium provides a powerful launchpad for them to do just that.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202"

Such a framework would replace the malleable and opaque ad hoc determinations of responsibility that states currently undertake in both the conventional force and the cyber contexts alike. To this end, this Note introduces a sliding-scale evidentiary standard that adapts to the—often limited—availability of evidence and short amount of time a victim might have to respond to cyber attacks.\nThis Note analogizes to attribution problems faced by the international community in the past, such as piracy and privateering on the eighteenth century’s high seas, to demonstrate that the legal problems posed by cyber capabilities are not unfamiliar. But the ubiquity of cyber capabilities and diffuse nature of the cyber landscape mean that the solution must be different. This Note demonstrates that a newly proposed non-governmental attribution body, structured like a tribunal, could meet the tremendous need many victims face in gathering the evidence to overcome the attribution problem inherent to cyberspace. Such a body, this Note argues, provides the best launchpad for developing the international norms—and, eventually, the customary international law—needed to build evidentiary standards in the cyber context.\nINTRODUCTION ... 1\nI.

Treaties dealing directly with cyber operations are scarce in number and limited in scope.¹ State cyber practices are held close to the chest and, although their publicly available expressions are increasing, there are still too few to constitute well-defined norms to develop comprehensive customary international law.² While it at least seems clear today that existing principles of international law apply in cyberspace,³ states—perhaps as a result of their own strategic caution⁴—have, at present, left to the academy and non-governmental bodies much of the task of determining how such principles apply.⁵ Against this hazy legal backdrop, states and non-state actors alike have wasted no time in deploying cyber attacks and exploitations of ever more destructive and exploitative power. In June 2017, according to the U.S. government, the Russian military launched “the most destructive and costly cyber attack in history,” using ransomware dubbed “NotPetya” to cause billions of dollars in damage across Europe, the Americas, and Asia.⁶ Just two months later, in August 2017, a petrochemical plant in Saudi Arabia suffered a cyber attack that was designed to trigger an explosion that likely\n¹ Introduction to International Governmental Group of Experts, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations 3 (Michael N.

Namely, the application of state responsibility principles¹⁰ remains difficult—if not impossible—where victims cannot reliably and transparently identify the actor responsible or, worse, if the attacker’s identity remains unknown.

Charter and core principles of customary international law, such as state sovereignty and non-intervention.¹¹\nThis Note begins in Part I by defining the attribution problem and identifying the factual challenges it poses for dealing with offensive cyber operations. It then explores the evidentiary framework by which attribution claims in both the conventional and cyber context are measured. In doing so, it attempts to identify and help fill the gap in the academic literature surrounding what standards of proof are and should be expected to be met under international law. Toward this end, it introduces a novel application of a sliding scale of proof, one tied to the severity of the victim’s response rather than solely to the underlying breach of international law. Part I then concludes by providing a brief overview of how principles of state responsibility apply in cyberspace.\nPart II identifies a number of the proposed solutions to the attribution problem suggested in the literature—such as intergovernmental inspection and compliance bodies as well as multilateral treaties—and explains why they are inadequate in the cyber context or are unlikely to come about. It then critiques and builds upon the solution highlighted by this Note: a non-governmental global consortium of representatives from private companies, academia, and think tanks that assesses available forensic evidence to provide an attributional assessment for victims of cyber attack or exploitation.¹² But the value of this organization does not just lie in its ability to provide a much-needed leader for neutral and capable technical investigations. Rather, it has significant potential to lay the groundwork for the proposed sliding-scale evidentiary framework’s\n¹¹ See Waxman, supra note 4, at 426.\n¹² While this Note recognizes the benefits of solutions that propose an intergovernmental organization to govern cyber capability use and compliance, akin to the International Atomic Energy Agency (“IAEA”), see, e.g., Scott Charney et al., Microsoft Corp., From Articulation to Implementation: Enabling Progress on Cybersecurity Norms 11 (2016), it also recognizes that states are highly unlikely in today’s toxic geopolitical environment to agree to allow representatives from foreign governments to inspect some of their most closely held secrets. Further, significant doubts might arise as to the neutrality of governmental representatives serving in the body’s management and operational roles, risking the legitimacy and independence of the body’s assessments.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202\nLefebvre\nCracking Attribution\n4\nadoption into customary international law. And perhaps just as significant, the quality of the organization's attributional assessments carry great promise for their potential to shape state practice toward an expectation of higher quality attributional claims against other states.\nRather than have states judge for themselves how much proof is necessary to respond to an attack,¹³ this Note argues that states might feel obligated to justify their actions in the face of a quantifiable confidence metric, one that could be provided by the proposed non-governmental attribution body. Through reference to the attributional assessment of a neutral and sophisticated body, a state's self-defense¹⁴ and countermeasure¹⁵ activities could rest on a firmer and more transparent evidentiary foundation. In this way, this Note makes the novel suggestion that this non-governmental organization could serve as the best launchpad for developing customary international law to build evidentiary standards in the cyber context.\n## I. DEFINING THE ATTRIBUTION PROBLEM AND ITS SCOPE\nThe attribution problem is often viewed as a technical challenge with a technical solution: the tools of offensive cyber operations make it easy to hide one's identity from a victim, so would-be victims need to build cyber defensive capabilities and cyber forensic investigative capabilities to overcome this challenge. But the limitations of cyber defensive and investigative capabilities can and do pose obstacles to the application of international law. Principally, they foreground the question of how a state could respond lawfully under international law if it does not know against whom it should respond. The immensity of this problem, however, overshadows the subsequent\n¹³ See infra note 78 and accompanying text.\n¹⁴ This Note keys the term “self-defense” to its meaning under Article 51 of the U.N. Charter, limiting it to a victim state’s uses of force taken against an aggressor state in response to an armed attack. U.N. Charter, art. 51.\n¹⁵ In this Note, the term “countermeasures” is used as a term of art. It refers to actions taken by a victim state that amount to a breach of its international obligations vis-à-vis an aggressor state. Such actions must be taken with the goal of bringing the aggressor state back into compliance with its international obligations vis-à-vis the victim state and cannot exceed what is necessary and proportionate to effectuate that goal. Without the preceding act of aggression, these actions would otherwise be considered unlawful. Int’l. L. Comm’n, Rep. on the Work of its Fifty-Third Session, U.N. Doc. A/56/10, at 128–31 (2001).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202\nLefebvre\nCracking Attribution\n5\nobstacle for the international community: the lack of evidentiary standards under international law to evaluate these claims. Together, international law’s lack of evidentiary standards for evaluating a victim’s identification of an attacker and the limited availability of evidence to meet such standards compound the challenges cyber capabilities pose, severely hampering international law’s application and development in cyberspace.¹⁶\nThis Part addresses both of these obstacles. It demonstrates why reliable, standardized, and transparent determinations of a cyber attacker’s identity—referred to throughout this Note as “attributional assessments” or “attributional claims”—are necessary to the successful application of international law’s principles to cyberspace, and it evaluates how customary international law could be developed to meet this end. Toward this effort, Section I.C addresses a relative gap in the literature by assessing what standard of proof is and should be necessary when making an attributional claim.\nFor the purposes of this Note, “attribution” is tied to identity, rather than an action’s particular cause. In this context, attribution refers to the process of determining the “identity or location of an attacker or an attacker’s intermediary.”¹⁷ To qualify as an interstate attributional claim, the identity of the attack or exploitation’s independent operators must be connected with customary international law’s principles of state responsibility, largely reflected in the second Tallinn Manual and discussed in Section I.D.¹⁸ Ultimately, once the technical assessment of the\n¹⁶ Waxman, supra note 4, at 426 (“[T]he low visibility of states’ moves and countermoves in cyberspace will slow the process of interpretive development . . . . Article 2(4) will probably be a weak constraint on offensive cyber-attacks because of, among other reasons, the difficulty of observing them and attributing them to their sources or sponsors . . . . Those weaknesses will . . . likely plague any attempt to negotiate and enforce new international agreements limiting cyber-warfare.”).\n¹⁷ David D.

This Note distinguishes a cyber attack from a cyber exploitation by defining the former as operations that “target one of several attributes of systems or networks and seeks to cause a loss of integrity, a loss of authenticity, or a loss of availability, which includes theft of services.”²⁰ The term “cyber exploitation” is used to refer to operations that target only the “confidentiality of information stored on or passing through a system or network.”²¹ The two terms are collectively referred to as “offensive cyber operations” throughout the piece.\nWhile attribution of cyber attacks and exploitations presents problems for domestic criminal law enforcement and international law alike, this Part, and indeed this Note, will focus primarily on the attribution problem as it relates to international law. Setting aside the technical difficulties of attribution, domestic criminal law—at least in the United States—already supplies procedural mechanisms for assessing the evidence that underlies attributional claims, such as in camera review of classified intelligence.²² Such procedural mechanisms do not transfer well to the\nthe International Law Commission’s (“ILC”) Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (“Articles on State Responsibility”) endorsed in the U.N.

Conventional Parallels\nThe difficulty in linking attacks to the identity of the attacker is not a new problem for international law: states have struggled with making such determinations for centuries. This is true where another state has been the attacker, where a non-state actor acting under its own direction has been the attacker, and where state proxies acting under the direction of a sponsoring state have been the source of the attacks. Some commentators have drawn parallels between today’s challenges in policing cyberspace to those created by the state use of privateers on the high seas in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.²⁴ Florian Egloff notes how both the high seas through that period and cyberspace involve a range of actors, each with varying degrees of direction and control from a sponsoring state.²⁵ Between these two different eras and environments, the parallels between state actors, semi-state actors, and non-state actors can be readily drawn: respectively, consider the similarities between formal navies and cyber military units, privateers and today’s “patriotic hackers,”²⁶ or even pirates and most modern cybercriminals or cybercrime organizations.²⁷\n²³ See infra note 66.\n²⁴ Florian Egloff, Cybersecurity and the Age of Privateering, in Understanding Cyber Conflict: 14 Analogies 231, (George Perkovich &amp; Ariel E. Levite eds., 2017); Noah Schachtman &amp; Peter W. Singer, The Wrong War: The Insistence on Applying Cold War Metaphors to Cybersecurity is Misplaced and Counterproductive, Brookings (August 15, 2011), https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-wrong-war-the-insistence-on-applying-cold-war-metaphors-to-cybersecurity-is-misplaced-and-counterproductive/.\n²⁵ Florian Egloff, Cybersecurity and the Ague of Privateering, in Understanding Cyber Conflict: 14 Analogies, supra note 24, at 238–39.\n²⁶ The term “patriotic hackers” is a reference to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s suggestion that “patriotically minded” private Russian hackers, but not the Russian government or its organs, could have been the operators behind the 2016 cyber exploitation of the U.S. Democratic National Committee’s servers. Andrew Higgins, Maybe Private Russian Hackers Meddled in Election, Putin Says, N.Y.

In large part, it is not unlike that provided to modern states by “patriotic hackers” or other non-state actors in cyberspace who act with impunity in a harboring state, if not the state’s explicit sponsorship.²⁹ To deal with the difficulties arising out of this ambiguity, state practice led to expectations—and, eventually, customary international law—that privateers would post their true flags before firing a shot from across the bow in order to seize another ship for search, despite allowing false flags to be flown while chasing a vessel.³⁰ While this helped to mitigate the attribution difficulties that arose, they were not entirely resolved until privateering fell out of use after it was abolished by multilateral treaty in 1856.³¹\nMore modern comparisons are often drawn to the Cold War, where attribution and causality issues frequently arose in the context of Article 2(4) of the U.N.

While technical attribution capabilities are increasing for many states, including the United States, the identification of the machine or machines used in carrying out the attack, their operators, or even the geographic locations of the machines and their operators is not always enough when making a determination of state responsibility.³⁶ Yet the stakes are high. If the injured state responds to a wrongful act under international law³⁷ with a countermeasure aimed at a wrongly accused state, then the injured state has then committed an internationally wrongful act by engaging in countermeasures against an innocent state.³⁸ Simply put, the international legal framework currently in place for responding to uses of force, armed attacks, and other breaches of international obligations cannot function properly without reliable attributional assessments, regardless of whether the unlawful action occurs in the context of a cyber or a traditional physical operation.³⁹\n³⁴ Id.\n³⁵ See Banks, supra note 2, at 1493 (describing some of the technical challenges posed by cyber attacks and exploitations).\n³⁶ Banks, supra note 2, at 1502.

The Factual Challenge of Attribution\nAttribution of interstate cyber operations—like operations in the conventional kinetic context—can be broken down into two components: (1) the identity of the individual operators who carried out the operation; and (2) the relationship those operators have, if any, to any given state.⁴⁰ These two components comprise factual inquiries, of course, into what machines were used to carry out an attack, who operated them, and who directed or controlled those operators for purposes of the operation.\nAt the most basic level, an offensive cyber operation involves one or more individuals, often acting remotely, who interfaces with one or more computers or entire networks—usually by means of programming code—in order to gain access to the targeted systems through hardware or software security vulnerabilities or through fraudulent credentials. Once the operation’s conductors have gained access to the desired system, they attempt to take advantage of the system to plant code, known as malware,⁴¹ that will destroy or degrade the intruded system, exfiltrate information from the system, or both.⁴²\nCyber operations pose significant and unique challenges in the evidentiary context as it relates to both the identity of the operator and attribution to a state. This is in part because the operations are “opaque to public view, technically very complex and likely to emerge piecemeal,” unlike conventional kinetic attacks, which are visible and “can be and often are broadcast widely, immediately, and understandably [and, further, the] common experience [of such attacks] makes\n⁴⁰ See Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua (Nicar. v.

Once the work of these operators has been compiled into these groups, their errors and the evidence of their identity begin to stack up across operations and malware toolkits, leading forensic investigators to more easily identify them.⁵⁹ Lastly, the identity of targets themselves might provide clues as to whom the attacker might be, since victim-targeting patterns might assist forensic analysts in building a more accurate attacker profile.⁶⁰\nBut intermediate-to-advanced cyber actors do not proceed unaware of these investigative tactics. Sophisticated operators, while not immune to making mistakes that could help reveal their true identity, are familiar with attribution methods used at private cybersecurity firms and state intelligence agencies, and many of them make good use of their knowledge. Offensive cyber operators of this sophistication level often create “ghost leads” by leaving behind intentional errors that point in the direction of different actors who had no role in the attack or exploitation.⁶¹ These\n⁵⁶ Bartholomew &amp; Guerrero-Saade, Kaspersky Lab, USA, supra note 44, at 1–2; see Scott J.

HUMINT includes sources such as interviews with recruited foreign agents. Despite the private sector's incredible technical forensics capabilities—which can rival that of states in terms of its technical capacity to identify offensive cyber operators—some of these more traditional sources of intelligence are unavailable to even the most sophisticated cybersecurity firms.⁶⁵ While Symantec, Kaspersky, FireEye, CrowdStrike, and others may have an incredible talent pool and significant financial resources, they do not \"control the wires\" nor can they deploy on-the-ground espionage operations to develop critical intelligence to help implicate responsible states or better ascertain the identities of operators.\nBut even those states that are able to meet the factual challenge of identifying an attacker with a high degree of confidence are often unwilling to release much of the evidence on which\n⁶² See supra notes 49–55 and accompanying text (discussing the offensive cyber operation against TV5Monde).\n⁶³ See Cyber Warfare in the 21st Century: Threats, Challenges, and Opportunities: Hearing Before the H.

What are the legal obligations of states to publicly disclose the evidence on which the attribution claim has been made? And what degree of control over the individual operators is necessary to hold a state responsible? The first two relate to evidentiary standards for evaluating how much evidence a state must show and who, if any party, must bring forward that evidence. The third question relates to principles of state responsibility under international law.\n## C. Locating Evidentiary Standards for State Breaches of International Obligations\nDespite the need to develop some sort of factual basis for the claim that one state has breached its international obligations to another,⁶⁷ there is no unified international law of evidence that governs what evidence should make up that factual basis or what that factual basis needs to prove.⁶⁸ This is true in both the conventional context and in cyberspace. The issue has been made plain most recently in the 2018 Salisbury chemical attack, in which the United Kingdom accused the Russian Federation of attempting to assassinate, on British soil, former Russian military intelligence officer and British spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia Skripal with a Novichok nerve agent.⁶⁹ The United Kingdom declared that it would find Russia to have breached its\n⁶⁶ See, e.g., Ellen Nakashima, U.S. Decides Against Publicly Blaming China for Data Hack, Wash.

In April 2018, the country released a letter from Sir Mark Sedwill, the United Kingdom’s National Security Advisor, to the Secretary General of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, indicating that the Russian government was testing Novichok agents on door handles.75\n70 Ellen Barry &amp; Richard Pérez-Peña, Britain Blames Moscow for Poisoning of Former Russian Spy, N.Y.

But given its willingness to provide some evidence publicly and share significant amounts of intelligence with allies, one might suppose that this burden is not insubstantial. Despite the difference between cyber operations and chemical attacks—which, particularly due to the sheer complexity of handling chemical agents like Novichoks, carry less plausible deniability than an actor would have in an offensive cyber operation—the evidentiary problems in the international arena are strikingly similar.\n1. Is There an Attribution Standard for Cyberspace Under International Law?\nIn the cyber context, the answers to the evidentiary questions are even more underdeveloped due to the paucity of transparent state practice and *opinio juris*—a term that refers to a state’s sense of legal obligation—in making public attributional statements for offensive cyber operations.⁷⁶ In its 2015 report, the U.N. Group of Governmental Experts acknowledged that attribution claims for cyber operations “should be substantiated.” But the report failed to articulate how much or what type of evidence is necessary for states to justify countermeasures or acts of self-defense under international law, or even whether such claims must be substantiated publicly.⁷⁷ The United States has gone one step further in articulating its position on the matter in remarks made in November 2016 by then-U.S. Department of State Legal Adviser Brian Egan:\n⁷⁶ See Tallinn Manual 2.0, supra note 1, at 83. In order to establish customary international law, there must be a history of state practice driven by a sense of legal obligation, referred to as *opinion juris*.\n⁷⁷ Rep. of the Group of Governmental Experts on Devs. in the Field of Info. and Telecomms. in the Context of Int’l Security, transmitted by Letter Dated 26 June 2015 from Deborah Stokes (Chair of the Group), U.N.

A/70/174 at 13 (July 22, 2015) (“[T]he indication that an ICT activity was launched or otherwise originates from the territory or the ICT infrastructure of a State may be insufficient in itself to attribute the activity to that State. The Group noted that the accusations of organizing and implementing wrongful acts brought against States should be substantiated.”).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202\nLefebvre\nCracking Attribution\n18\nThe law of state responsibility does not set forth explicit burdens or standards of proof for making a determination about legal attribution. In this context, a State acts as its own judge of the facts and may make a unilateral determination with respect to attribution of a cyber operation to another State. Absolute certainty is not—and cannot be—required. Instead, international law generally requires that States act reasonably under the circumstances when they gather information and draw conclusions based on that information.78\nThe IGE understands this “reasonableness” standard as involving an examination of whether states have considered, among other factors, the reliability, quantum, directness, nature, and specificity of the relevant information available to the injured state in light of attendant circumstances and the importance of the right involved.79 While these factors are fairly malleable, the method is not dissimilar from the “ad hoc” way in which states evaluate factual claims in the conventional force context.80\nAs to whether the reasonableness standard includes the obligation to publicly disclose the evidence on which an attribution claim has been made, the IGE was of the opinion that there is not enough state practice or *opinio juris* to evidence such a requirement under customary international law.81 This insufficiency is, in large part, a result of the highly classified nature of cyber capabilities, whether used offensively, defensively, or as part of a forensic investigation.82 Conceivably, this could change as more forensic analysis of cyber operations is conducted by\n78 Brian J. Egan, Remarks on International Law and Stability in Cyberspace at Berkeley Law School (Nov. 10, 2016), https://www.law.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/egan-talk-transcript-111016.pdf. It is worth noting that Egan’s statement may be a step forward, but it does not amount to much. No state could possibly expect absolute certainty given the difficulties surrounding attribution of offensive cyber operations. By settling on a requirement of “reasonableness,” the statement begs the question it is trying to answer, since such “reasonableness” can run the gamut in terms of what it could require.\n79 Tallinn Manual 2.0, supra note 1, at 82 (noting, in addition, that the available information considered need not be restricted to technical intelligence if it can be supplemented with highly reliable human intelligence).\n80 See Jules Lobel, Colloquy, The Use of Force to Respond to Terrorist Attacks: The Bombing of Sudan and Afghanistan, 24 Yale J.

The commentary accompanying the Draft Articles on State Responsibility notes:\nIn a bilateral dispute over State responsibility, the onus of establishing responsibility lies in principle on the claimant State. Where conduct in conflict with an international obligation is attributable to a State and that State seeks to avoid its responsibility by relying on a circumstance under chapter V [which describes circumstances precluding wrongfulness], however, the position changes and the onus lies on that State to justify or excuse its conduct.⁸⁵\nThis is echoed in the ICJ’s judgment in the *Oil Platforms* case.⁸⁶ In that case, the ICJ indicated that the United States bore the burden of proving that Iranian forces fired a missile at the *Sea Isle City*, a Kuwaiti tanker reflagged to the United States, which had made a defensive claim for which it used this evidence as the factual basis.⁸⁷\n⁸³ Banks, supra note 2, at 1507; see Cyber Warfare in the 21st Century: Threats, Challenges, and Opportunities: Hearing Before the H.

Does International Law Already Contain a General Attribution Standard?\nDrawing from the above, it would seem that, at present, no state under international law carries an obligation of publicly proving its attributional claim by revealing the available evidence, whether that be in the cyber or conventional force context.⁸⁸ Nor does it seem that states carry a well-defined burden under international law related to the quality or amount of evidence used in proving an attributional claim before undertaking acts of self-defense or countermeasures against the accused state.⁸⁹ Further, strikingly few commentators have even addressed the issue of evidentiary burdens under international law. But despite the IGE’s findings and the claims that states like the United States have made about (non-)obligations under international law, there is a contingent of those few who have argued the contrary. Such commentators claim that sufficient state practice exists to locate the standard of proof required of attribution claims.⁹⁰\nProfessor Mary Ellen O’Connell has argued that, at least in situations in which states are justifying the use of force under Article 51’s self-defense provision, state practice and the decisions of international courts and tribunals support a “clear and convincing” standard in evaluating evidence.⁹¹ She claims that “the international authority for the standard consists of several\n⁸⁸ See also Banks, supra note 2, at 1499 (“Applying the Rules on State Responsibility and attribution compiled in Tallinn 2.0, there is no burden of proof or requirement that there exists definitive information on attribution. Although wise as a matter of policy, the failure to offer persuasive evidence of State attribution is not wrongful legally.”); Lobel, supra note 80, at 538 (discussing how the lack of an “international judicial or other centralized fact-finding mechanism” means that the states assess factual claims on an “ad hoc” basis).\n⁸⁹ Banks, supra note 2, at 1499.\n⁹⁰ See, e.g., O’Connell, supra note 68 (claiming a clear and convincing standard of proof for uses of force under Article 51 of the U.N. Charter); see Robin Geiß &amp; Henning Lahmann, Freedom and Security in Cyberspace: Shifting the Focus Away From Military Responses Towards Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention, in Peacetime Regime for State Activities in Cyberspace: International Law, International Relations and Diplomacy 621, 624 (Katharina Ziolkowski ed., 2013) (arguing that a “clear and convincing” standard has been applied in ICJ decisions governing state responsibility). Professor O’Connell’s paper arguing that a clear-and-convincing has proven the most influential out of those few that argue in favor of its existence, and so my argument places the most emphasis on defusing the claim as she describes it.\n⁹¹ O’Connell, supra note 68, at 21–28; see Geiß &amp; Lahmann, Freedom and Security in Cyberspace: Shifting the Focus Away From Military Responses Towards Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention, in Peacetime Regime for State Activities in Cyberspace: International Law, International Relations and Diplomacy, supra note 90, at 624 (arguing that the “clear and convincing” standard was applied by the ICJ implicitly in the its decisions in the Nicaragua case, Oil Platforms case, and Armed Activities case).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202\nLefebvre\nCracking Attribution\n21\ndecisions of international courts and tribunals, including the implicit standard in the Nicaragua case.” She also finds support in the statements of U.S. officials characterizing evidence as “clear,” “convincing,” and “compelling” before or after launching counter-attacks in response to terrorist attacks, including the 1986 bombing of Libya in response to the infamous West Berlin discotheque attack that same year, a 1993 attack against Iraq after an alleged assassination attempt against former President George H.W. Bush, and the 1998 bombing of Sudan and Afghanistan after attacks on U.S. embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam.⁹² Professor O’Connell’s evidence for such claims raises questions, however, about whether such an obligation truly exists under international law.\nFirst, while she cites examples of state practice of injured states using language indicating that they are in possession of “clear,” “compelling,” or “convincing” evidence of having suffered an internationally wrongful act at the hand of a particular state, there is no indication that this is done out of a sense of legal obligation.⁹³ State practice on its own is insufficient to establish customary international law; it is only when it is done out of a sense of legal obligation, or *opinio juris*, that it can be considered customary international law. Further, the fact that she only cites U.S. practice draws into question whether one state’s practice is enough, even if the United States were acting out of a sense of legal obligation. Lastly, the United States and any number of other states have a multitude of political reasons to indicate that they are in possession of “clear” or “convincing” evidence. There is no suggestion that such states believe that this is an evidentiary floor that must be met under international law before they can act on the evidence in their possession.\n⁹² O’Connell, supra note 31, at 23–28.\n⁹³ But see Mark Landler &amp; Michael R. Gordon, *Air War in Kosovo Seen as Precedent in Possible Response to Syria Chemical Attack*, N.Y.

The ICJ’s opinion in the Nicaragua case, which these commentators claim supports a “clear and convincing” standard,⁹⁵ suggests that its standard of proof derives from Article 53 of the Statute on the International Court of Justice,⁹⁶ which does not purport to have impact outside of the operations of that court.⁹⁷ Further, O'Connell’s evidence that the ICJ uses a “clear and compelling” standard of proof is limited to consistent references to whether evidence is “sufficient” or “insufficient.”⁹⁸ But declaring whether a particular amount of evidence is sufficient is distinct from whether it is necessary. Indeed, the ICJ’s opinion merely points to the fact that evidence has met or surpassed the necessary standard of proof; it does not indicate what that standard is. While the ICJ does mention that its findings of fact should be based upon “convincing” evidence, it includes a caveat: that it should only do so to the extent that “the nature of the case permits.”⁹⁹ This seems to suggest a shifting standard of proof, determined on the basis of the availability and nature of the facts.\nProfessors Robin Geiß and Henning Lahmann make similar claims about the standard of proof in the Oil Platforms and Armed Attacks cases, claiming the ICJ uses an implicit “clear and convincing” standard.¹⁰⁰ But again, the ICJ in the Oil Platforms case merely refers to the\n⁹⁴ O'Connell, supra note 68, at 23–24; Geiß &amp; Lahmann, supra note 90, at 624; see also Marco Roscini, Symposium, Evidentiary Issues Related to Cyber Operations, 50 Tex.

Indeed, the ICJ’s proceedings only require enough proof to “satisfy” the ICJ in law and in fact, a rather flexible standard.¹⁰³ Conceivably, as the ICJ suggested in its decision in the Nicaragua case, the ICJ may find itself satisfied with applying different standards of proof in different contexts, depending on the amount of evidence available or the difficulty in proving particular claims. This makes it even more difficult to make an inference about the standard it is using to judge the facts before it.¹⁰⁴ Particularly since there is little state practice and no apparent opinio juris to support a standard of proof for state attribution claims against other states for a breach of an international obligation,¹⁰⁵ any inferences about the standard of proof used by the ICJ appear to be cabined to that international body.¹⁰⁶ This only becomes clearer when one considers that the ICJ derives its power to set a standard of proof from its foundational statute. It is not derived from principles of customary international law or some other species of international law that has broad impact\n¹⁰¹ Case Concerning Oil Platforms (Islamic Republic of Iran v.

The Value of a Sliding-Scale Attribution Standard\nThe absence of a standard of proof in these matters may be surprising, but it is likely—at least in part—a reflection of the reluctance among nations to share closely guarded intelligence methods on a global stage in front of ally and adversary alike.¹⁰⁸ There is little doubt, however, that developing international norms to establish a standard of proof for attributional claims before undertaking countermeasures or self-defense measures would force states to exercise restraint in using these tools. One would hope that such restraint could help prevent conflicts from escalating or even spilling over into wrongly accused states that had no previous role in a particular conflict.¹⁰⁹ Problems arise, though, in determining how high such a standard should be for cyber operations, given the difficulty many states face in being able to make an attributional claim with a high degree of confidence in a short amount of time. Any standard of proof employed should be sufficiently flexible to allow a state to act quickly enough for its countermeasures to serve as an adequate means of forcing the offending state back into compliance with its international\n¹⁰⁷ See Statute of the International Court of Justice, June 26, 1945, art. 53(2), 59 Stat. 1055, 1062, T.S. No. 993.\n¹⁰⁸ The reluctance, of course, is not unfounded. Sharing intelligence with adversaries can better clue them into the methods of the victim state’s intelligence collection, helping adversaries to better identify their own security vulnerabilities. For one example of how providing intelligence can change an adversary’s behavior in a way that threatens a state’s national security, see Eric Schmitt &amp; Michael S. Schmidt, *Queda Plot Leak Has Undermined U.S. Intelligence*, N.Y. Times (Sept. 29, 2013), https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/30/us/qaeda-plot-leak-has-undermined-us-intelligence.html (describing how after an intelligence leak, analysis have detected a sharp drop in terrorists’ use of a major communications channel that had been monitored by U.S. officials).\n¹⁰⁹ U.N.

Such difficulty might be resolved by applying a shifting standard of proof, not unlike what the ICJ appears to employ based upon “the nature of the case.”\nA standard of proof tied to the anticipated severity of the victim state’s response rather than to the severity of the underlying breach might meet the goals of timely response while adapting to the lower quality and quantity of evidence available to the victim state shortly after suffering an offensive cyber operation.¹¹⁰ For example, the victim state might only need to find on the balance of evidence that a particular state is responsible for an offensive cyber operation if deploying countermeasures, such as the violation of a treaty between the victim and aggressor states, but it may need clear-and-convincing evidence to respond with a use of armed force. This proposal falls in line with the second Tallinn Manual’s suggestion that “the greater the underlying breach . . . the greater the confidence ought to be in the evidence relied upon by a State considering a response” since the “robustness of permissible self-help responses grows commensurately with the seriousness of the breach.”¹¹¹ For example, a state should be more confident in its attribution when it responds with armed force to a cyber attack on an air traffic control system that resulted in aircraft accidents and fatalities. The same should be expected if it were to suffer an attack on the underground pump controllers for an underground rail system that resulted in major flooding and destruction of its infrastructure. If a state were to suffer a denial of service attack on the website of a regulatory agency that issues permits for hunting and fishing, however, principles of necessity and proportionality dictate that the victim state would only be permitted to respond with something\n¹¹⁰ Professors Christian Payne and Lorraine Finlay have proposed a standard of proof tied to the victim’s response, but they have failed to provide much detail other than suggesting victim states that “pursue peaceful, legal processes” for resolving disputes related to cyber operations should “have the benefit of eschewing stringent attribution tests normally required.” Payne &amp; Finlay, supra note 5, at 567. In such cases, they suggest strict liability for those states that the victim state believes to be the host states for the attack. Id. at 566–67. They do not discuss the standard of proof necessary to undertake countermeasures and argue that the “effective control” standard is required for self-defense measures. Id.; see also infra note 132 and accompanying text (discussing the “effective control” standard).\n¹¹¹ Tallinn Manual 2.0, supra note 1, at 82 (citing Oil Platforms, 2003 I.C.J. at ¶ 67 (separate opinion of Judge Higgins)).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202\nLefebvre\nCracking Attribution\n26\nbelow the use of force, such as committing a violation of a trade or tax treaty between the two states.¹¹²\nUnder a shifting standard of proof for attributional claims, a state could respond to the first two examples with countermeasures if it perhaps only had probable cause that a given state had conducted the attacks. After acquiring evidence to prove its attributional claim at a higher standard of proof, such as clear-and-convincing evidence, a state could respond with armed force if it were to conclude that such force would be proportional and necessary to repel the attack or later attacks.¹¹³ This shifting standard of proof does not change the ultimate severity ceiling of the response available to the victim state, which is still tied to the underlying breach and governed by principles of proportionality and necessity; rather, it adapts the severity of the response to the standard of proof that the victim state is able to meet at any given point.¹¹⁴ This would allow victim states to respond—at least in some fashion—more quickly, and thereby more effectively, to offensive cyber operations than if a higher evidentiary threshold were required uniformly among all types of responses. Victim states, of course, could still increase the severity of their responses as needed to force the attacking state back into compliance with its international obligations, so long as the certainty in the attacker’s identity correspondingly increased.\nAdmittedly, such a standard might result in more severe and more frequent state responses against less sophisticated actors—who lack the ability to hide the evidence that leads to their identity—than sophisticated actors. But this is no different than any other system that requires evidentiary burdens to be met before responsive measures can be taken: even in domestic criminal\n¹¹² See infra note 113.\n¹¹³ International Governmental Group of Experts, Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare 61 (Michael N. Schmitt ed., 2013).\n¹¹⁴ While outside the scope of this Note, there is no reason why such a standard could not be tied to any use of force, whether it be conventional or cyber. Indeed, there is a colorable argument that it would be wise to apply such a standard beyond the cyber context, particularly given the ad hoc factual evaluation of conventional use of force events and their associated attribution problems.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202\nLefebvre\nCracking Attribution\n27\nlaw systems, sophisticated criminals are less likely to be punished than the amateur thief. Further, and more importantly, the proposed evidentiary framework will create opportunities for states to take measures against actors whose sophistication in hiding their identity would, under a more exacting standard of proof, leave victims without any recourse time and time again.\nPart II further explores how evaluations of such evidence could be more publicly accountable by allowing states to submit their claims to a neutral body that would provide an attributional assessment of the offensive cyber operation, including a forensic report and a confidence judgment as to the culprit. It also examines how such a body could contribute to the creation of international norms—and, eventually, customary international law—that integrate this sliding-scale evidentiary framework and which make it clear what standard of proof a state should have to meet before responding with the use of force or countermeasures. In this way, the body could create a platform through which states could better define customary international law, even where attempts to build positive international law have stalled or failed.^^\n## D. Frameworks for Assessing State Responsibility for Cyber Operations\nIn contrast with standards of proof, principles of state responsibility are far better defined under international law, thanks to the ICJ's jurisprudence and the International Law Commission's (\"ILC\") Articles on State Responsibility. As a result, the second Tallinn Manual provides far more guidance about principles of state responsibility as they relate to cyber operations, beginning with Tallinn Rule 14's threshold^^: \"A State bears international responsibility for a cyber-related act\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202\nLefebvre\nCracking Attribution\n28\nthat is attributable to the State and that constitutes a breach of an international legal obligation.”¹¹⁷ Rules 15–18 particularize this requirement by adapting it to common situations, with each rule further attenuating the relation from the responsible state. Rule 15 indicates that states are responsible for cyber operations conducted by their own organs and individual representatives of the state who are authorized to exercise the governmental authority of the state.¹¹⁸ Rule 16 addresses situations in which a state places one of its organs at the disposal of another state. It indicates that cyber operations are attributable to the latter state so long as it is exercising government authority over the former state’s organ.¹¹⁹ Rule 17 deals with state control of non-state actors. It identifies that the state is responsible for those cyber operations committed by non-state actors that it directs, controls, or that the state acknowledges and adopts as its own, reflecting the concept of “effective control” articulated in the Nicaragua case.¹²⁰ Rule 18 deals with a state’s responsibility for the cyber operations of foreign states, concluding that one state bears responsibility for another’s cyber operation when, knowing of the act’s wrongful character, it either coerces, aids or assists, or directs and controls that state in the operation.¹²¹ As a result of the distributed nature of the Internet, the second Tallinn Manual took the view that geography is of little importance into inquiries of state responsibility.¹²² Instead, the inquiry is almost entirely grounded in the instruction received and control exercised by any given state.¹²³\n¹¹⁷ Tallinn Manual 2.0, supra note 1, at 84. The language “breach of an international legal obligation” is particularly important, since it does not include activities that are either unregulated by international law, such as cyber espionage and related intelligence gathering, or are expressly permitted, such as suspension of international cyber communication services within its territory.

Despite differences in what evidence is required, the evidentiary standard remains the same for each.¹²⁷ Thus, in order to reach an attribution conclusion, the analysis developed in the previous Section should be applied not just to factual determinations that lead to the identities of individual cyber operators, but to factual determinations that lead to conclusions about state responsibility.\n## II. MOVING TOWARD A GLOBAL CONSORTIUM\nDespite the risk of global destabilization that cyber capabilities pose, there are at present no international bodies or meaningful multilateral treaties that regulate their use or encourage state compliance with obligations under international law.¹²⁸ As noted above, the lack of international\n¹²⁴ Id. at 30.\n¹²⁵ Id. at 30, 83.\n¹²⁶ Geiß &amp; Lahmann, supra note 28, at 634, 636–37.\n¹²⁷ Id. at 81–82.\n¹²⁸ Elena Chernenko et al., Increasing International Cooperation in Cybersecurity and Adapting Cyber Norms, Council on Foreign Relations (Feb. 23, 2018), https://www.cfr.org/report/increasing-international-cooperation-cybersecurity-and-adapting-cyber-norms.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202\nLefebvre\nCracking Attribution\n30\nnorms governing activities in cyberspace, the technical challenges surrounding attribution, and the fact that these capabilities can be easily hidden until deployed make cyber capabilities particularly difficult to monitor.\nWhile Russia and China support a cyber treaty regulating the use of cyber “weapons,” the United States does not, preferring instead to direct efforts toward developing international norms around the use of cyber capabilities.¹²⁹ Given the United States’ role in the international community and its strength in the cyber landscape, there is little hope of building a productive multilateral agreement without its support.¹³⁰ But the United States’ preferred path forward has encountered its own roadblocks after the collapse of consensus among the U.N. Group of Governmental Experts on Information Security, a multilateral attempt to more firmly establish customary international law in the cyber context.¹³¹\nSome, most notably Microsoft Corporation, the Atlantic Council, and the RAND Corporation, have called for the creation of an attributional organization that would investigate offensive cyber operations and provide assessments on the identity of the likely culprit or culprits. Microsoft and the Atlantic Council have suggested that the body be built as an intergovernmental compliance and attribution body akin to the International Atomic Energy Agency (“IAEA”) or the\n¹²⁹ International Cybersecurity Strategy: Deterring Foreign Threats and Building Global Cyber Norms: Hearing Before the Subcomm.

This is in part because the United States takes an “effects” view the term “cyber weapon,” rather than seeing them as a class of tools that are identifiable as weapons in and of themselves. That is to say, the United States considers a cyber tool a weapon based on the effects of its use rather than based on the nature of its architecture.

The IAEA and OPCW are built upon formal arms control, prohibition, or inspection agreements that are unlikely to be replicated in the cyber context in the foreseeable future.¹³³ Their development was also likely further aided by the high barriers to attaining, maintaining, and deploying the capabilities they sought to regulate; such barriers are far higher than those surrounding the accessibility of cyber capabilities.¹³⁴ Further, the IAEA is an organ of the United Nations and membership in its two policymaking bodies, the Board of Governors and the General Conference of IAEA Member States, is limited to states.¹³⁵ While the OPCW is independent from the United Nations, its governing body is also limited to member states, as is its General Conference.¹³⁶ The IAEA and OPCW, appropriately, have been lauded for their work, but the inclusion of states in the membership of any attributional or investigative body creates risks for that body’s neutrality and the perceived legitimacy of its judgments.¹³⁷ Indeed, this risk might be greater in the cyber context.

Building a Private Body for a Public Good\nIn 2017, researchers at the RAND Corporation published a white paper proposing the creation of an attributional organization that would exclude states from its management and operation, referring to the proposed body as the “Global Cyber Attribution Consortium” (“the Consortium”).¹⁴⁰ Instead of states, RAND proposes that the body be managed and operated by cyberspace legal and policy experts, international policy experts from academia and research organizations, and technical experts from academia as well as cybersecurity and information technology companies.¹⁴¹ RAND recognizes that these actors are not immune to politicization: they may face pressures from their home markets or states of incorporation, or they may inherently possess strong national loyalties. But such a body would at least be further removed from state political interests and face more political accountability at the international level, to the extent that the companies and research organizations involved conduct global operations.¹⁴² Most\n¹³⁸ Davis et al., RAND Corp., supra note 51, at 31; see Efrony, supra note 133 (“None of the experts should be simultaneously employed by governmental institutions to avoid even the appearance of conflicts of interest.”).\n¹³⁹ Davis et al., RAND Corp., supra note 51, at 31.\n¹⁴⁰ Id at 27, 33. To be clear, by using the term “attribution organization,” the suggestion is that the organization engages exclusively in attributional assessments. Unlike the proposals suggested by Microsoft and the Atlantic Council, it has no enforcement function. See Charney, Microsoft Corp., supra note 12, at 11; Jason Healey, et al., Atlantic Council, Confidence-Building Measures in Cyberspace: A Multistakeholder Approach for Stability and Security 10 (2014).\n¹⁴¹ Davis et al., RAND Corp., supra note 51, at 29; see also Efrony, supra note 133 (supporting the idea of excluding states from a global attribution body).\n¹⁴² Admittedly, “global operations” does not mean such operations will be equal among all states. One might argue that states with more sophisticated technology sectors could have more influence over the Consortium than states with less sophisticated technology sectors, since such countries will likely have stronger ties to members of the Consortium. But given the wide network of global interests and partnerships that states with sophisticated technology sectors have, which often tie them to states with smaller technology sectors, it is unlikely that the Consortium could or would privilege states along this line. Consider, for example, Russia’s collaborative interests with Iran, or the United States’ strong relationship with Afghanistan. Given this, the more relevant distinction may be between those states with friends and those without.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202\nLefebvre\nCracking Attribution\n33\nimportantly, it would be less likely that governing and operational member organizations would have played a role in the offensive operations under the Consortium’s investigation than if the Consortium included states as members.\nJust being further removed from the risk of politicization, however, is not enough. The nature of the organization’s work requires not only a better reputation for neutrality than what could be accomplished with an intergovernmental organization, but an incredibly strong reputation for neutrality and expertise. This would, at a minimum, require geographic diversity from each of the sectors represented and strict transparency in both its governance and evaluation methodologies and procedures.¹⁴³ As RAND puts it, with no international norms to rely upon at present, the Consortium can only derive its legitimacy over time from “the reputation and credibility gained from the technical expertise of its diverse global membership and its commitment to objectivity and transparency in its attribution findings.”¹⁴⁴\nTo deliver on the promise of providing more reliable and transparent attributional assessments than what states have offered to date, the Consortium would need to include formalized conditions that trigger its review, standardized processes for evidence collection and assessment, attribution-confidence standards, procedures for notification and publication of results, and standardized procedures to assess the severity and sophistication of offensive operations.¹⁴⁵ Indeed, standardization and transparency are two crucial elements missing from the current diffuse attribution regime. As discussed, because of the lack of clear evidentiary standards, states at present have little incentive to be transparent in their technical analysis.¹⁴⁶ Further, even\n¹⁴³ See Davis et al., RAND Corp., supra note 51, at 30.\n¹⁴⁴ Id.\n¹⁴⁵ Davis et al., RAND Corp., supra note 51, at 35.\n¹⁴⁶ See supra Section I.C.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202\nLefebvre\nCracking Attribution\n34\nthough cybersecurity firms have been more transparent in their investigative reports of cyber incidents, they use diverging assessment procedures and nomenclatures, making it difficult to compile the bodies of evidence over time.¹⁴⁷ A centralized leader in attribution would be able to develop standardized nomenclature, attribution-confidence standards, and other best practices to improve not just the quality of its own assessments, but help promote effective and standardized attribution practices globally.¹⁴⁸ A body led in part by the world’s leading cybersecurity and information technology firms might be particularly well positioned to build and promote these best practices. Because such firms hold significant influence in the industry, they could integrate the standardized practices developed for the Consortium into the investigative procedures that they conduct independently for clients of their business units, pushing the entire industry toward standardization. This is a key benefit of the Consortium, since—given the incredible variety and number of offensive cyber operations carried out—RAND envisions the body having a discretionary docket.¹⁴⁹ For example, the Consortium may choose to take up an attack that destroyed petrochemical refineries, electrical grids, or nuclear reactors but be forced to turn down requests to investigate low-level denial-of-service attacks.¹⁵⁰ After conducting the investigation, the Consortium would provide its forensic report, attribution assessment, and the confidence level\n¹⁴⁷ See Davis et al., RAND Corp., supra note 51, at 20; Max Smeets, When Naming Cyber Threat Actors Does More Harm Than Good, Council on Foreign Relations: Blog (Oct. 24, 2016), https://www.cfr.org/blog/when-naming-cyber-threat-actors-does-more-harm-good (“First, if a competitor has already discovered a threat actor, the threat actor shouldn’t be renamed to fit another company’s branding. Even though renaming is in a firm’s interest to promote its brand, it sows confusion across the cybersecurity community and frustrates efforts to obtain accurate data on incidents and threat actors.”).\n¹⁴⁸ The signatories to the Cybersecurity Tech Accord, discussed supra note 179 and accompanying text, has similarly endorsed cybersecurity standards.

While the Consortium would only begin an investigation at the request of the victim,¹⁵² the question remains, at least in some cases, as to which victim would have the proper standing to file a request with the Consortium.¹⁵³ For example, if an electrical utility suffers an attack on its infrastructure, does the state retain exclusive rights to trigger the investigation and publicize the results or should the utility company have the ability to file an investigation request? RAND suggests leaving such decisions up to the discretion of the Consortium.¹⁵⁴ But granting a private entity standing to bring an investigation request makes little sense, particularly given the consequences for the victim state if the operation were publicized and a state or non-state actor were accused. At the time of the request’s filing, there may be little clue as to the identity of the attacker. The risks of giving a private entity the right to publicize attacks and accuse another state with the Consortium’s platform and credibility behind its claim could cause significant difficulties for states in planning and conducting their international relations.¹⁵⁵ While private entities may be hesitant to report attacks to their host states—particularly if they might be liable in some way for the intrusion—these concerns make it more prudent to favor giving states exclusive standing to bring the claim and to publicize the results.\n¹⁵¹ Id. at 39.\n¹⁵² Id.\n¹⁵³ Id. at 36.\n¹⁵⁴ Id.\n¹⁵⁵ This concern resembles those that some have been expressed about claims made under the Alien Tort Statute and their potential to interfere with the foreign affairs of the United States.

Rev. 1117, 1119–20 (2011).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202\nLefebvre\nCracking Attribution\n36\nMore complex issues arise when deciding which of multiple states should have standing to bring a claim. Consider, for example, a scenario in which an actor conducts an offensive cyber operation against a company incorporated in the United States with its principal place of business in the United States. Suppose, however, that the company also has offices in Beijing and the offensive cyber operation was conducted exclusively against the company’s servers in Beijing, resulting in significant physical destruction of company property and the death of one or more U.S. nationals. On one hand, one might think that the United States is the victim state, since a kinetic attack was conducted against its nationals and their property.¹⁵⁶ However, if the culprit is a foreign state, China would have suffered an armed attack and a violation of its territorial integrity.¹⁵⁷ But depending on the circumstances surrounding the attack, there might even be reasonable suspicion that China itself is the culprit. Which state should be able to bring the episode to the Consortium? The answer, at least on these facts, seems to be that both states should have standing to bring the investigation request. But even if both parties have standing, should both enjoy the right to publicize the result? If the United States wanted to publicize the result, but China did not, should China retain a veto over the United States’ decision to publicize? The answer to that question is unclear, but it demonstrates that standing to bring an investigation request may not necessarily track with the right to publicize the result. It would seem prudent, despite the international relations costs, for the Consortium to tie standing with the exclusive right to publicize the results: divvying\n¹⁵⁶ Even if the United States did not suffer a use of force or armed attack against its territorial integrity or political independence in this scenario, it was a victim of an Article 2(4) violation if one takes a somewhat broader conception of the provision. One state killing the nationals of another state would, at the very least, be activity “inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations.” U.N. Charter art. 2(4). Customary international law’s doctrine permitting the protection of nationals abroad seems to reflect that this is a sensible construction as does the principle of passive personality. See Restatement (Third) of the Foreign Relations Law of the U.S., § 402 cmt. g (Am. Law. Inst. 1987) (passive personality principle); Andrew W.R. Thomson, Doctrine of the Protection of Nationals Abroad: Rise of the Non-Combatant Evacuation Operation, 11 Wash. Univ. Global Studs. L. Rev. 627, 628–29 (2011) (protection of nationals abroad principle); see also 2 Vattel, The Law of Nations; or Principles of the Law of Nature; Applied to the Conduct and Affairs of Nations and Sovereigns § 71 (Joseph Chitty ed., Philadelphia, T.&amp;J.W. Johnson &amp; Co. 1872) (“Whoever uses a citizen ill, indirectly offends the State, which is bound; to protect this citizen; and the sovereign of the latter should avenge his wrongs, punish the aggressor, and, if possible, oblige him to make full reparation; since otherwise the citizen would not obtain the great end of the civil association, which is, safety.”).\n¹⁵⁷ Tallinn Manual 2.0, supra note 1, at 340–41.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202\nLefebvre\nCracking Attribution\n37\nup the right to publicize so that multiple victims have the ability to exercise veto power will only lead to fewer publicized judgments, one of the critical needs the Consortium is designed to meet. Regardless, the Consortium’s discretion will become critical in its standing determinations, since its legitimacy and neutrality could be at risk depending on how it chooses to decide these issues.\nAt least in what might be expected in the typical case, where it is clear which state has both standing to bring the request and the right to publicize results, the Consortium’s work functions similarly to a pretrial hearing in the United States, where the Consortium acts as both factfinder and judge. While this is yet another area that the RAND proposal does not discuss with much depth, it would be sensible for the Consortium to provide the accused state with an advance copy of the Consortium’s report and an opportunity to rebut its conclusion and aspects of forensic report. This stage of the investigation could provide victim states with an opportunity to supplement the technical report from the Consortium’s forensic investigation with evidence gained through the victim state’s intelligence capabilities, such as from SIGINT and HUMINT, perhaps presenting such information to the Consortium in camera. To the extent a victim state is unwilling to share its intelligence with the Consortium, the only cost would be a lower confidence level in the attribution assessment than the Consortium would otherwise be able to provide. Alternatively, the Consortium might be able to release its forensic report and confidence assessment of the identity of the individual operators but provide a no-confidence or low-confidence assessment of state responsibility. Such a report would, at the very least, be valuable if the victim state chose to indict the operators under its domestic criminal law.¹⁵⁸\n¹⁵⁸ See, e.g., Press Release, U.S. Dep’t of Justice, North Korean Regime-Backed Programmer Charged with Conspiracy to Conduct Multiple Cyber Attacks and Intrusions (Sept. 6, 2018), https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/north-korean-regime-backed-programmer-charged-conspiracy-conduct-multiple-cyber-attacks-and.

Filling the Evidentiary Gap and Building International Norms\nEven if the Consortium did not grant every investigation request it received, it still would have the potential to shift international norms toward stricter and more uniform standards of proof for attribution claims, paving the way for the sliding-scale evidentiary framework proposed in Part I. Further, in the investigations it would accept, its technical capabilities could still help to fill the evidentiary gap that states face in justifying countermeasures or self-defense, especially where the victim state’s technical capabilities are lacking.\nTo the extent that states are able to point to an independent body’s declassified cyber forensic investigation, a state’s justification for countermeasures would be built on firmer factual ground than if it only had its classified intelligence to rely upon. With a reduced ability to hide behind a claim of pretextual or false accusation, states might exercise more caution in conducting offensive cyber operations or might restrict themselves to low-level uses of force so as not to draw attention of the Consortium.¹⁵⁹ This is true whether or not key players in the international community choose to submit a case to the Consortium. One may expect that the United States, China, Israel, or Russia may at first feel more comfortable relying upon the technical sophistication of their own intelligence communities to reliably identify culprits and might reject opening up the process to an independent body. But unlike with the political backing needed in a multilateral treaty, the Consortium could still provide much-needed technical assistance to less sophisticated middle-power and developing states that are targets of cyber attacks and exploitations, without the\nConducting Coordinated Campaign of Cyber Attacks Against U.S. Financial Sector (March 24, 2016), https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/seven-iranians-working-islamic-revolutionary-guard-corps-affiliated-entities-charged; Press Release, U.S. Dep’t Justice, U.S. Charges Five Chinese Military Hackers for Cyber Espionage Against U.S. Corporations and a Labor Organization for Commercial Advantage, (May 19, 2014), https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/us-charges-five-chinese-military-hackers-cyber-espionage-against-us-corporations-and-labor.\n¹⁵⁹ At least part of the blame for the difficulties of deterring offensive cyber operations lies with the challenges in reliably attributing the operations to the correct culprit.

Rather than have states act as their own judges of how much proof is necessary to respond to an attack,¹⁶² states might feel they are obligated to justify their actions in the face of a quantifiable confidence metric.\nStates might also choose to reference such assessments in their domestic prosecutions of the accused individuals. The United States, for example, has issued indictments against a number of foreign officials and others who use cyber operations to threaten U.S. national security.¹⁶³ If other states had access to similar technical resources to attribute attacks with a high enough degree\n¹⁶⁰ See U.N. Secretary-General, Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security 18, U.N. Doc.

Of course, while the governments of superpowered states are not necessary, the talent that resides within their territory would be.\n¹⁶¹ See Efrony, supra note 133 (supporting the notion that if attribution is built on transparent and objective parameters, other states would follow it, contributing to state practice).\n¹⁶² See supra note 78 and accompanying text.\n¹⁶³ Ashley Deeks, Moving Forward on Cyber Norms, Domestically, Lawfare (July 10, 2017, 1:10PM) https://lawfareblog.com/moving-forward-cyber-norms-domestically; see, e.g., sources cited supra note 158.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202\nLefebvre\nCracking Attribution\n40\nof confidence for prosecution—resources that the Consortium could provide—others could follow in the footsteps of the United States. While domestic prosecutions might not do much to shape international norms around the level of confidence needed to institute countermeasures or engage in self-defense, they could help build international norms for acceptable and unacceptable behavior in cyberspace.¹⁶⁴ By building out international norms, customary international law could develop around evidentiary standards and behavior in cyberspace where top-down diplomacy and positive law efforts have largely stalled or failed.¹⁶⁵\n## C. Challenges Ahead\nDespite the promise an independent non-governmental attribution body like the Consortium holds for building international norms, challenges remain for the Consortium’s effective execution. If independence is a key feature, from what sources could it responsibly derive funding? How will such a body prioritize its investigations and how will it deliver results quickly enough to meet the need for timely response that victim states will face? Further, without traditional sources of intelligence at hand, how will such a body meet the need to connect an operator’s activity with state direction and control in the case of state-sponsored attacks?\nRAND suggests initial funding from philanthropic sources and the inclusion of a charter mandate to seek funding from the United Nations at a later point.¹⁶⁶ RAND also points to the possibility of funding from cybersecurity and information technology companies that operate and defend much of the infrastructure upon which attacks are launched.¹⁶⁷ This might not be so far-fetched: if the Consortium were able to build a strong reputation in the international community,\n¹⁶⁴ Deeks, supra note 163.\n¹⁶⁵ See supra note 115.\n¹⁶⁶ Davis et al., RAND Corp., supra note 51, at 44.\n¹⁶⁷ Id. at 45.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202\nLefebvre\nCracking Attribution\n41\nparticipation might be a badge of honor for private sector firms, translating to increased business opportunities.\nIf it could be done transparently, this Note suggests another solution: the Consortium might even charge clients fees for attribution services, in accordance with their ability to pay, basing its schedule off of the United Nations’ scale of assessments for the apportionment of its expenses.¹⁶⁸ Admittedly, this might introduce risks to its neutrality if the organization appears to demonstrate something akin to customer loyalty. If any attribution body were to accept fees for its services to offset its costs, its revenue streams would need to be diversified enough to prevent reliance on fees from any particular state, region, or global bloc.\nDeveloping prioritization policies may best be left to the discretion of the Consortium, given the variety of effects cyber attacks produce and the difficulty in organizing attacks by their severity. For example, the Consortium might be forced to choose between investigating a cyber attack that resulted in an explosion that killed tens of people or a ransomware attack that paralyzed the state’s ability to provide key services and cost its citizens and businesses hundreds of millions of dollars and maybe, indirectly, loss of life.¹⁶⁹ In this case, one might suggest investigating the former first, since the victim state in that case would have suffered an armed attack under the effects test¹⁷⁰ and would have the right to respond in self-defense, if such measures were necessary to prevent future attacks.¹⁷¹ However, one can imagine murkier cases where the severity might be tied to the degree of harm suffered by the victim. For example, two ostensibly different attacks on two different central bank accounts might result in the same amount of money lost, but one of\n¹⁶⁸ Cf. G.A. Res. 70/245 (December 23, 2015) (detailing the U.N. scale of assessments).\n¹⁶⁹ Cf. supra note 6–7 and accompanying text (detailing cyber attacks that either did or would have resulted in similar damage).\n¹⁷⁰ Tallinn Manual 2.0, supra note 1, at 340–41.\n¹⁷¹ U.N. Charter, art. 51.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202\nLefebvre\nCracking Attribution\n42\nthese attacks might cause more harm to one victim state than the other, based on the relative wealth of the two states.\nEven if the Consortium were able to develop severity prioritization rules, the body might not be able to complete the investigation in a timely enough fashion for a state to respond. If a state continues to suffer armed attacks or uses of force, the victim might need to respond with self-defense measures under Article 51 or enact countermeasures in order to bring the culprit back into compliance with its international obligations. In such a situation, the Consortium might be able to release preliminary findings at a lower confidence level. Acting on any such findings could operate under a “buyer beware” framework, a concept that would tie nicely with the sliding-scale evidentiary framework proposed in Section I.C.¹⁷² Over time, international norms—and perhaps, eventually, customary international law—could be built around the level of confidence expected from attributional assessments before a state could pursue countermeasures, invoke pleas of necessity, or undertake acts of self-defense. The Consortium’s findings would make the adoption of this sliding-scale evidentiary framework more easily possible, since the findings would provide a quantifiable, standardized, and easily referenced confidence level for the international community to debate. Over time, this transparency could help develop international law’s standards of proof by providing more transparent examples of state practice, leading to easier identification of the *opinio juris* needed to locate customary international law. For example, one might find, after mapping the Consortium’s confidence levels of its attribution assessments to the corresponding state responses, that states are only willing to enact countermeasures on confidence levels of fifty percent or higher and self-defense measures on confidence levels of seventy-five percent or higher.\n¹⁷² See supra note 109–111 and accompanying text.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202\nLefebvre\nCracking Attribution\n43\nWhile forensic analyses can assess the sophistication levels of threat actors and can support inferences about state involvement based on the sophistication of the attack, making state responsibility claims will be difficult, especially if states begin to contract out more and more offensive cyber operations to non-state actors.¹⁷³ Associating state control with offensive cyber operations is not impossible, however, and to date private cybersecurity firms have been able to find enough clues to make at least low- or medium-confidence assessments of state responsibility. In 2013, Mandiant felt confident enough to attach blame to a Chinese military unit for numerous attacks on U.S. corporations, organizations, and government agencies.¹⁷⁴ And FireEye has compiled enough evidence to confidently connect a threat it refers to as “APT37,” or “Reaper,” with the North Korean state.¹⁷⁵ While this is an area where traditional intelligence capabilities will still be critical to attribution investigations, the Consortium’s work can help bolster claims of state responsibility made by states based on classified evidence, even if the Consortium’s findings are less conclusive than evidence the victim state might possess.\nPerhaps the most significant challenge facing the Consortium is the ostensibly low likelihood that competing tech companies would come together to participate in the organization. But there are reasons to think that prominent players in the tech sector would be more interested than some might suppose. The most public example is Microsoft President and Chief Legal Officer Brad Smith’s campaign for a new “Digital Geneva Convention,” which he brought to the United\n¹⁷³ See Payne &amp; Finlay, supra note 5, at 562.\n¹⁷⁴ David Sanger et al., Chinese Army Unit is Seen as Tied to Hacking Against U.S., N.Y.

The tech sector plays a unique role as the internet's first responders, and we therefore should commit ourselves to collective action that will make the internet a safer place, affirming a role as a neutral Digital Switzerland that assists customers everywhere and retains the world's trust.¹⁷⁸\nSmith has gone to great lengths in an attempt to operationalize this principle, by leading the campaign to sign on more than thirty tech firms to the “Cybersecurity Tech Accord,” including Cisco, Dell, Facebook, FireEye, HP, Symantec, and Oracle.¹⁷⁹ The accord’s principles commit the signatories to supporting civil society, governments, and international organizations in advancing and building cybersecurity capacity to protect against offensive cyber operations, among other goals that would align with the driving principles behind organizing the Consortium.¹⁸⁰ While the accord is still young, its existence is a helpful indication of the tech sector’s thinking on these issues, and it suggests that the possibility of an investigative body like the Consortium is more greater than it appears on its face.\n¹⁷⁶ Brad Smith Takes His Call for a Digital Geneva Convention to the United Nations, Microsoft: Microsoft On the Issues (Nov. 7, 2017), https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2017/11/09/brad-smith-takes-call-digital-geneva-convention-united-nations/.\n¹⁷⁷ Sam Meredith, Microsoft Calls for ‘New Digital Geneva Convention’ after Spate of High-Profile Cyberattacks, CNBC (Jan. 26, 2018), https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/26/microsoft-calls-for-new-digital-geneva-convention-after-spate-of-high-profile-cyberattacks.html\n¹⁷⁸ Brad Smith, The Need for a Digital Geneva Convention, Microsoft: Microsoft on the Issues (Feb. 14, 2017), https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2017/02/14/need-digital-geneva-convention/#sm.0001hkfw5aob5evwum620jqwsabzv.\n¹⁷⁹ David Sanger, Tech Firms Sign “Digital Geneva Accord” Not to Aid Governments in Cyberwar, N.Y.

While multilateral treaties and international cooperation might be the preferred avenue to overcome them, current trends provide little hope for the success of such options. Despite this, the development of customary international law provides an opportunity to push forward in regulating state behavior surrounding cyberspace. This Note demonstrates how an attributional body like the Consortium stands to provide substantial benefit to the development of these norms by providing states with a transparent and independent mechanism upon which to build evidentiary standards, such as the sliding-scale evidentiary framework, to undergird countermeasures and acts of self-defense. In this way, the international community can make more consistent judgments about state action in response to offensive cyber operations. While this may provide less flexibility for states to act in the face of such operations than what is nearly guaranteed through today's system of opaque unilateral evidentiary assessments, such restrictions on state behavior would benefit the international community at large by increasing global stability. Further, adopting this Note's version of a sliding-scale approach to the standard of proof—one where the standard fluctuates based on the response a victim wishes to undertake—should accommodate the flexibility states need when attempting to respond to quickly to a cyber attack.\nBy offering both victim states and the accused the opportunity to obtain an independent, sophisticated, and quantifiable attributional assessment, a body like the Consortium could help alleviate the deterrence difficulties inherent in a low-confidence attribution landscape and reduce the risk that states escalate or begin conflicts with parties that have no relation to the conflict. Questions persist regarding sources of funding for the Consortium, its operational efficiency in light of the need for quick responses to severe offensive operations, and the remaining difficulty\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202\nLefebvre\nCracking Attribution\n46\nof connecting cyber operators to state direction and control. But they are by no means insurmountable.\nWhatever the case, the world will not stand still in the cyber landscape. If international law is to be of any value in restricting dangerous state behavior in this arena, its development must push forward. States can still do their part to gradually advance international norms by responsibly conducting their own cyber practices and related behavior in an effort to shape customary international law. An independent non-governmental attributional body like the Consortium provides a powerful launchpad for them to do just that.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202"

      "flat_text": "# CRACKING ATTRIBUTION: MOVING INTERNATIONAL NORMS FORWARD\nJoshua Lefebvre\nThis Note addresses how international law can meet the challenge of reliably and transparently identifying the actor responsible for a cyber attack, a feature of the cyber landscape referred to as the “attribution problem.” It examines the potential for customary international law to define evidentiary standards for evaluating claims of a cyber attacker’s identity, standards which would have to be met before a state victim could retaliate. Such a framework would replace the malleable and opaque ad hoc determinations of responsibility that states currently undertake in both the conventional force and the cyber contexts alike. To this end, this Note introduces a sliding-scale evidentiary standard that adapts to the—often limited—availability of evidence and short amount of time a victim might have to respond to cyber attacks.\nThis Note analogizes to attribution problems faced by the international community in the past, such as piracy and privateering on the eighteenth century’s high seas, to demonstrate that the legal problems posed by cyber capabilities are not unfamiliar. But the ubiquity of cyber capabilities and diffuse nature of the cyber landscape mean that the solution must be different. This Note demonstrates that a newly proposed non-governmental attribution body, structured like a tribunal, could meet the tremendous need many victims face in gathering the evidence to overcome the attribution problem inherent to cyberspace. Such a body, this Note argues, provides the best launchpad for developing the international norms—and, eventually, the customary international law—needed to build evidentiary standards in the cyber context.\nINTRODUCTION ... 1\nI.

Treaties dealing directly with cyber operations are scarce in number and limited in scope.¹ State cyber practices are held close to the chest and, although their publicly available expressions are increasing, there are still too few to constitute well-defined norms to develop comprehensive customary international law.² While it at least seems clear today that existing principles of international law apply in cyberspace,³ states—perhaps as a result of their own strategic caution⁴—have, at present, left to the academy and non-governmental bodies much of the task of determining how such principles apply.⁵ Against this hazy legal backdrop, states and non-state actors alike have wasted no time in deploying cyber attacks and exploitations of ever more destructive and exploitative power. In June 2017, according to the U.S. government, the Russian military launched “the most destructive and costly cyber attack in history,” using ransomware dubbed “NotPetya” to cause billions of dollars in damage across Europe, the Americas, and Asia.⁶ Just two months later, in August 2017, a petrochemical plant in Saudi Arabia suffered a cyber attack that was designed to trigger an explosion that likely ¹ Introduction to International Governmental Group of Experts, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations 3 (Michael N.

Namely, the application of state responsibility principles¹⁰ remains difficult—if not impossible—where victims cannot reliably and transparently identify the actor responsible or, worse, if the attacker’s identity remains unknown.

It then explores the evidentiary framework by which attribution claims in both the conventional and cyber context are measured. In doing so, it attempts to identify and help fill the gap in the academic literature surrounding what standards of proof are and should be expected to be met under international law. Toward this end, it introduces a novel application of a sliding scale of proof, one tied to the severity of the victim’s response rather than solely to the underlying breach of international law. Part I then concludes by providing a brief overview of how principles of state responsibility apply in cyberspace.\nPart II identifies a number of the proposed solutions to the attribution problem suggested in the literature—such as intergovernmental inspection and compliance bodies as well as multilateral treaties—and explains why they are inadequate in the cyber context or are unlikely to come about. It then critiques and builds upon the solution highlighted by this Note: a non-governmental global consortium of representatives from private companies, academia, and think tanks that assesses available forensic evidence to provide an attributional assessment for victims of cyber attack or exploitation.¹² But the value of this organization does not just lie in its ability to provide a much-needed leader for neutral and capable technical investigations. Rather, it has significant potential to lay the groundwork for the proposed sliding-scale evidentiary framework’s ¹¹ See Waxman, supra note 4, at 426.\n¹² While this Note recognizes the benefits of solutions that propose an intergovernmental organization to govern cyber capability use and compliance, akin to the International Atomic Energy Agency (“IAEA”), see, e.g., Scott Charney et al., Microsoft Corp., From Articulation to Implementation: Enabling Progress on Cybersecurity Norms 11 (2016), it also recognizes that states are highly unlikely in today’s toxic geopolitical environment to agree to allow representatives from foreign governments to inspect some of their most closely held secrets. Further, significant doubts might arise as to the neutrality of governmental representatives serving in the body’s management and operational roles, risking the legitimacy and independence of the body’s assessments.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202 Lefebvre Cracking Attribution Rather than have states judge for themselves how much proof is necessary to respond to an attack,¹³ this Note argues that states might feel obligated to justify their actions in the face of a quantifiable confidence metric, one that could be provided by the proposed non-governmental attribution body. Through reference to the attributional assessment of a neutral and sophisticated body, a state's self-defense¹⁴ and countermeasure¹⁵ activities could rest on a firmer and more transparent evidentiary foundation. In this way, this Note makes the novel suggestion that this non-governmental organization could serve as the best launchpad for developing customary international law to build evidentiary standards in the cyber context.\n## I. DEFINING THE ATTRIBUTION PROBLEM AND ITS SCOPE The attribution problem is often viewed as a technical challenge with a technical solution: the tools of offensive cyber operations make it easy to hide one's identity from a victim, so would-be victims need to build cyber defensive capabilities and cyber forensic investigative capabilities to overcome this challenge. But the limitations of cyber defensive and investigative capabilities can and do pose obstacles to the application of international law. Principally, they foreground the question of how a state could respond lawfully under international law if it does not know against whom it should respond. The immensity of this problem, however, overshadows the subsequent ¹³ See infra note 78 and accompanying text.\n¹⁴ This Note keys the term “self-defense” to its meaning under Article 51 of the U.N. Charter, limiting it to a victim state’s uses of force taken against an aggressor state in response to an armed attack. U.N. Charter, art. 51.\n¹⁵ In this Note, the term “countermeasures” is used as a term of art. It refers to actions taken by a victim state that amount to a breach of its international obligations vis-à-vis an aggressor state. Such actions must be taken with the goal of bringing the aggressor state back into compliance with its international obligations vis-à-vis the victim state and cannot exceed what is necessary and proportionate to effectuate that goal. Without the preceding act of aggression, these actions would otherwise be considered unlawful. Int’l. L. Comm’n, Rep. on the Work of its Fifty-Third Session, U.N. Doc. A/56/10, at 128–31 (2001).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202 Lefebvre Cracking Attribution This Part addresses both of these obstacles. It demonstrates why reliable, standardized, and transparent determinations of a cyber attacker’s identity—referred to throughout this Note as “attributional assessments” or “attributional claims”—are necessary to the successful application of international law’s principles to cyberspace, and it evaluates how customary international law could be developed to meet this end. Toward this effort, Section I.C addresses a relative gap in the literature by assessing what standard of proof is and should be necessary when making an attributional claim.\nFor the purposes of this Note, “attribution” is tied to identity, rather than an action’s particular cause. In this context, attribution refers to the process of determining the “identity or location of an attacker or an attacker’s intermediary.”¹⁷ To qualify as an interstate attributional claim, the identity of the attack or exploitation’s independent operators must be connected with customary international law’s principles of state responsibility, largely reflected in the second Tallinn Manual and discussed in Section I.D.¹⁸ Ultimately, once the technical assessment of the ¹⁶ Waxman, supra note 4, at 426 (“[T]he low visibility of states’ moves and countermoves in cyberspace will slow the process of interpretive development.... Article 2(4) will probably be a weak constraint on offensive cyber-attacks because of, among other reasons, the difficulty of observing them and attributing them to their sources or sponsors.... Those weaknesses will... likely plague any attempt to negotiate and enforce new international agreements limiting cyber-warfare.”).\n¹⁷ David D.

The second Tallinn Manual’s restatement of the law of state responsibility in cyberspace largely reflects Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202 Lefebvre Cracking Attribution While attribution of cyber attacks and exploitations presents problems for domestic criminal law enforcement and international law alike, this Part, and indeed this Note, will focus primarily on the attribution problem as it relates to international law. Setting aside the technical difficulties of attribution, domestic criminal law—at least in the United States—already supplies procedural mechanisms for assessing the evidence that underlies attributional claims, such as in camera review of classified intelligence.²² Such procedural mechanisms do not transfer well to the the International Law Commission’s (“ILC”) Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (“Articles on State Responsibility”) endorsed in the U.N. General Assembly Resolution on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts. G.A. Res. 56/83 (Jan. 28, 2002).

Conventional Parallels\nThe difficulty in linking attacks to the identity of the attacker is not a new problem for international law: states have struggled with making such determinations for centuries. This is true where another state has been the attacker, where a non-state actor acting under its own direction has been the attacker, and where state proxies acting under the direction of a sponsoring state have been the source of the attacks. Some commentators have drawn parallels between today’s challenges in policing cyberspace to those created by the state use of privateers on the high seas in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.²⁴ Florian Egloff notes how both the high seas through that period and cyberspace involve a range of actors, each with varying degrees of direction and control from a sponsoring state.²⁵ Between these two different eras and environments, the parallels between state actors, semi-state actors, and non-state actors can be readily drawn: respectively, consider the similarities between formal navies and cyber military units, privateers and today’s “patriotic hackers,”²⁶ or even pirates and most modern cybercriminals or cybercrime organizations.²⁷\n²³ See infra note 66.\n²⁴ Florian Egloff, Cybersecurity and the Age of Privateering, in Understanding Cyber Conflict: 14 Analogies 231, (George Perkovich &amp; Ariel E.

Charter’s prohibition on the use of force.³² This came about in large part from the transition from conventional war-making to “unconventional [and] low-intensity conflict [that] featured inconclusive evidence of foreign involvement or hostile action, and foreign state antagonists [who] worked to mask, conceal, or obscure their participation and responses.”³³ As with today’s cyber attacks and exploitations, “once ²⁸ Carl J.

While technical attribution capabilities are increasing for many states, including the United States, the identification of the machine or machines used in carrying out the attack, their operators, or even the geographic locations of the machines and their operators is not always enough when making a determination of state responsibility.³⁶ Yet the stakes are high. If the injured state responds to a wrongful act under international law³⁷ with a countermeasure aimed at a wrongly accused state, then the injured state has then committed an internationally wrongful act by engaging in countermeasures against an innocent state.³⁸ Simply put, the international legal framework currently in place for responding to uses of force, armed attacks, and other breaches of international obligations cannot function properly without reliable attributional assessments, regardless of whether the unlawful action occurs in the context of a cyber or a traditional physical operation.³⁹ ³⁴ Id.\n³⁵ See Banks, supra note 2, at 1493 (describing some of the technical challenges posed by cyber attacks and exploitations).\n³⁶ Banks, supra note 2, at 1502.

Once the operation’s conductors have gained access to the desired system, they attempt to take advantage of the system to plant code, known as malware,⁴¹ that will destroy or degrade the intruded system, exfiltrate information from the system, or both.⁴² Cyber operations pose significant and unique challenges in the evidentiary context as it relates to both the identity of the operator and attribution to a state. This is in part because the operations are “opaque to public view, technically very complex and likely to emerge piecemeal,” unlike conventional kinetic attacks, which are visible and “can be and often are broadcast widely, immediately, and understandably [and, further, the] common experience [of such attacks] makes ⁴⁰ See Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua (Nicar. v.

Locating Evidentiary Standards for State Breaches of International Obligations\nDespite the need to develop some sort of factual basis for the claim that one state has breached its international obligations to another,⁶⁷ there is no unified international law of evidence that governs what evidence should make up that factual basis or what that factual basis needs to prove.⁶⁸ This is true in both the conventional context and in cyberspace. The issue has been made plain most recently in the 2018 Salisbury chemical attack, in which the United Kingdom accused the Russian Federation of attempting to assassinate, on British soil, former Russian military intelligence officer and British spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia Skripal with a Novichok nerve agent.⁶⁹ The United Kingdom declared that it would find Russia to have breached its\n⁶⁶ See, e.g., Ellen Nakashima, U.S. Decides Against Publicly Blaming China for Data Hack, Wash.

Group of Governmental Experts acknowledged that attribution claims for cyber operations “should be substantiated.” But the report failed to articulate how much or what type of evidence is necessary for states to justify countermeasures or acts of self-defense under international law, or even whether such claims must be substantiated publicly.⁷⁷ The United States has gone one step further in articulating its position on the matter in remarks made in November 2016 by then-U.S. Department of State Legal Adviser Brian Egan: ⁷⁶ See Tallinn Manual 2.0, supra note 1, at 83.

The commentary accompanying the Draft Articles on State Responsibility notes: In a bilateral dispute over State responsibility, the onus of establishing responsibility lies in principle on the claimant State. Where conduct in conflict with an international obligation is attributable to a State and that State seeks to avoid its responsibility by relying on a circumstance under chapter V [which describes circumstances precluding wrongfulness], however, the position changes and the onus lies on that State to justify or excuse its conduct.⁸⁵ This is echoed in the ICJ’s judgment in the *Oil Platforms* case.⁸⁶ In that case, the ICJ indicated that the United States bore the burden of proving that Iranian forces fired a missile at the *Sea Isle City*, a Kuwaiti tanker reflagged to the United States, which had made a defensive claim for which it used this evidence as the factual basis.⁸⁷ ⁸³ Banks, supra note 2, at 1507; see Cyber Warfare in the 21st Century: Threats, Challenges, and Opportunities: Hearing Before the H.

But despite the IGE’s findings and the claims that states like the United States have made about (non-)obligations under international law, there is a contingent of those few who have argued the contrary. Such commentators claim that sufficient state practice exists to locate the standard of proof required of attribution claims.⁹⁰ Professor Mary Ellen O’Connell has argued that, at least in situations in which states are justifying the use of force under Article 51’s self-defense provision, state practice and the decisions of international courts and tribunals support a “clear and convincing” standard in evaluating evidence.⁹¹ She claims that “the international authority for the standard consists of several ⁸⁸ See also Banks, supra note 2, at 1499 (“Applying the Rules on State Responsibility and attribution compiled in Tallinn 2.0, there is no burden of proof or requirement that there exists definitive information on attribution.

Professor O’Connell’s paper arguing that a clear-and-convincing has proven the most influential out of those few that argue in favor of its existence, and so my argument places the most emphasis on defusing the claim as she describes it.\n⁹¹ O’Connell, supra note 68, at 21–28; see Geiß &amp; Lahmann, Freedom and Security in Cyberspace: Shifting the Focus Away From Military Responses Towards Non-Forcible Countermeasures and Collective Threat-Prevention, in Peacetime Regime for State Activities in Cyberspace: International Law, International Relations and Diplomacy, supra note 90, at 624 (arguing that the “clear and convincing” standard was applied by the ICJ implicitly in the its decisions in the Nicaragua case, Oil Platforms case, and Armed Activities case).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202 Lefebvre Cracking Attribution First, while she cites examples of state practice of injured states using language indicating that they are in possession of “clear,” “compelling,” or “convincing” evidence of having suffered an internationally wrongful act at the hand of a particular state, there is no indication that this is done out of a sense of legal obligation.⁹³ State practice on its own is insufficient to establish customary international law; it is only when it is done out of a sense of legal obligation, or *opinio juris*, that it can be considered customary international law. Further, the fact that she only cites U.S. practice draws into question whether one state’s practice is enough, even if the United States were acting out of a sense of legal obligation. Lastly, the United States and any number of other states have a multitude of political reasons to indicate that they are in possession of “clear” or “convincing” evidence. There is no suggestion that such states believe that this is an evidentiary floor that must be met under international law before they can act on the evidence in their possession.\n⁹² O’Connell, supra note 31, at 23–28.\n⁹³ But see Mark Landler &amp; Michael R.

Indeed, the ICJ’s proceedings only require enough proof to “satisfy” the ICJ in law and in fact, a rather flexible standard.¹⁰³ Conceivably, as the ICJ suggested in its decision in the Nicaragua case, the ICJ may find itself satisfied with applying different standards of proof in different contexts, depending on the amount of evidence available or the difficulty in proving particular claims. This makes it even more difficult to make an inference about the standard it is using to judge the facts before it.¹⁰⁴ Particularly since there is little state practice and no apparent opinio juris to support a standard of proof for state attribution claims against other states for a breach of an international obligation,¹⁰⁵ any inferences about the standard of proof used by the ICJ appear to be cabined to that international body.¹⁰⁶ This only becomes clearer when one considers that the ICJ derives its power to set a standard of proof from its foundational statute. It is not derived from principles of customary international law or some other species of international law that has broad impact ¹⁰¹ Case Concerning Oil Platforms (Islamic Republic of Iran v.

The Value of a Sliding-Scale Attribution Standard\nThe absence of a standard of proof in these matters may be surprising, but it is likely—at least in part—a reflection of the reluctance among nations to share closely guarded intelligence methods on a global stage in front of ally and adversary alike.¹⁰⁸ There is little doubt, however, that developing international norms to establish a standard of proof for attributional claims before undertaking countermeasures or self-defense measures would force states to exercise restraint in using these tools. One would hope that such restraint could help prevent conflicts from escalating or even spilling over into wrongly accused states that had no previous role in a particular conflict.¹⁰⁹ Problems arise, though, in determining how high such a standard should be for cyber operations, given the difficulty many states face in being able to make an attributional claim with a high degree of confidence in a short amount of time. Any standard of proof employed should be sufficiently flexible to allow a state to act quickly enough for its countermeasures to serve as an adequate means of forcing the offending state back into compliance with its international\n¹⁰⁷ See Statute of the International Court of Justice, June 26, 1945, art. 53(2), 59 Stat. 1055, 1062, T.S. No. 993.\n¹⁰⁸ The reluctance, of course, is not unfounded. Sharing intelligence with adversaries can better clue them into the methods of the victim state’s intelligence collection, helping adversaries to better identify their own security vulnerabilities. For one example of how providing intelligence can change an adversary’s behavior in a way that threatens a state’s national security, see Eric Schmitt &amp; Michael S. Schmidt, *Queda Plot Leak Has Undermined U.S. Intelligence*, N.Y. Times (Sept. 29, 2013), https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/30/us/qaeda-plot-leak-has-undermined-us-intelligence.html (describing how after an intelligence leak, analysis have detected a sharp drop in terrorists’ use of a major communications channel that had been monitored by U.S. officials).\n¹⁰⁹ U.N.

A/66/152 (July 15, 2011) (reply received from the United States) (“The lack of timely, high-confidence attribution and the possibility of ‘spoofing’ can create uncertainty and confusion for Governments, thus increasing the potential for crisis instability, misdirected responses and loss of escalation control during major cyberincidents.”).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202\nLefebvre\nCracking Attribution\n\nA standard of proof tied to the anticipated severity of the victim state’s response rather than to the severity of the underlying breach might meet the goals of timely response while adapting to the lower quality and quantity of evidence available to the victim state shortly after suffering an offensive cyber operation.¹¹⁰ For example, the victim state might only need to find on the balance of evidence that a particular state is responsible for an offensive cyber operation if deploying countermeasures, such as the violation of a treaty between the victim and aggressor states, but it may need clear-and-convincing evidence to respond with a use of armed force. This proposal falls in line with the second Tallinn Manual’s suggestion that “the greater the underlying breach... the greater the confidence ought to be in the evidence relied upon by a State considering a response” since the “robustness of permissible self-help responses grows commensurately with the seriousness of the breach.”¹¹¹ For example, a state should be more confident in its attribution when it responds with armed force to a cyber attack on an air traffic control system that resulted in aircraft accidents and fatalities. The same should be expected if it were to suffer an attack on the underground pump controllers for an underground rail system that resulted in major flooding and destruction of its infrastructure. If a state were to suffer a denial of service attack on the website of a regulatory agency that issues permits for hunting and fishing, however, principles of necessity and proportionality dictate that the victim state would only be permitted to respond with something ¹¹⁰ Professors Christian Payne and Lorraine Finlay have proposed a standard of proof tied to the victim’s response, but they have failed to provide much detail other than suggesting victim states that “pursue peaceful, legal processes” for resolving disputes related to cyber operations should “have the benefit of eschewing stringent attribution tests normally required.” Payne &amp; Finlay, supra note 5, at 567. In such cases, they suggest strict liability for those states that the victim state believes to be the host states for the attack. Id. at 566–67. They do not discuss the standard of proof necessary to undertake countermeasures and argue that the “effective control” standard is required for self-defense measures. Id.; see also infra note 132 and accompanying text (discussing the “effective control” standard).\n¹¹¹ Tallinn Manual 2.0, supra note 1, at 82 (citing Oil Platforms, 2003 I.C.J. at ¶ 67 (separate opinion of Judge Higgins)).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202 Lefebvre Cracking Attribution Under a shifting standard of proof for attributional claims, a state could respond to the first two examples with countermeasures if it perhaps only had probable cause that a given state had conducted the attacks. After acquiring evidence to prove its attributional claim at a higher standard of proof, such as clear-and-convincing evidence, a state could respond with armed force if it were to conclude that such force would be proportional and necessary to repel the attack or later attacks.¹¹³ This shifting standard of proof does not change the ultimate severity ceiling of the response available to the victim state, which is still tied to the underlying breach and governed by principles of proportionality and necessity; rather, it adapts the severity of the response to the standard of proof that the victim state is able to meet at any given point.¹¹⁴ This would allow victim states to respond—at least in some fashion—more quickly, and thereby more effectively, to offensive cyber operations than if a higher evidentiary threshold were required uniformly among all types of responses. Victim states, of course, could still increase the severity of their responses as needed to force the attacking state back into compliance with its international obligations, so long as the certainty in the attacker’s identity correspondingly increased.\nAdmittedly, such a standard might result in more severe and more frequent state responses against less sophisticated actors—who lack the ability to hide the evidence that leads to their identity—than sophisticated actors. But this is no different than any other system that requires evidentiary burdens to be met before responsive measures can be taken: even in domestic criminal ¹¹² See infra note 113.\n¹¹³ International Governmental Group of Experts, Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare 61 (Michael N. Schmitt ed., 2013).\n¹¹⁴ While outside the scope of this Note, there is no reason why such a standard could not be tied to any use of force, whether it be conventional or cyber. Indeed, there is a colorable argument that it would be wise to apply such a standard beyond the cyber context, particularly given the ad hoc factual evaluation of conventional use of force events and their associated attribution problems.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202 Lefebvre Cracking Attribution Part II further explores how evaluations of such evidence could be more publicly accountable by allowing states to submit their claims to a neutral body that would provide an attributional assessment of the offensive cyber operation, including a forensic report and a confidence judgment as to the culprit. It also examines how such a body could contribute to the creation of international norms—and, eventually, customary international law—that integrate this sliding-scale evidentiary framework and which make it clear what standard of proof a state should have to meet before responding with the use of force or countermeasures. In this way, the body could create a platform through which states could better define customary international law, even where attempts to build positive international law have stalled or failed.^[115]^ ## D. Frameworks for Assessing State Responsibility for Cyber Operations In contrast with standards of proof, principles of state responsibility are far better defined under international law, thanks to the ICJ's jurisprudence and the International Law Commission's (\"ILC\") Articles on State Responsibility. As a result, the second Tallinn Manual provides far more guidance about principles of state responsibility as they relate to cyber operations, beginning with Tallinn Rule 14's threshold^[116]^:\"A State bears international responsibility for a cyber-related act Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202 Lefebvre Cracking Attribution ¹¹⁷ Tallinn Manual 2.0, supra note 1, at 84.

Group of Governmental Experts on Information Security, a multilateral attempt to more firmly establish customary international law in the cyber context.¹³¹ Some, most notably Microsoft Corporation, the Atlantic Council, and the RAND Corporation, have called for the creation of an attributional organization that would investigate offensive cyber operations and provide assessments on the identity of the likely culprit or culprits. Microsoft and the Atlantic Council have suggested that the body be built as an intergovernmental compliance and attribution body akin to the International Atomic Energy Agency (“IAEA”) or the ¹²⁹ International Cybersecurity Strategy: Deterring Foreign Threats and Building Global Cyber Norms: Hearing Before the Subcomm.

That is to say, the United States considers a cyber tool a weapon based on the effects of its use rather than based on the nature of its architecture. This may be driven by differences in how the United States, Russia, and China view “information” as a threat to national security.

Building a Private Body for a Public Good\nIn 2017, researchers at the RAND Corporation published a white paper proposing the creation of an attributional organization that would exclude states from its management and operation, referring to the proposed body as the “Global Cyber Attribution Consortium” (“the Consortium”).¹⁴⁰ Instead of states, RAND proposes that the body be managed and operated by cyberspace legal and policy experts, international policy experts from academia and research organizations, and technical experts from academia as well as cybersecurity and information technology companies.¹⁴¹ RAND recognizes that these actors are not immune to politicization: they may face pressures from their home markets or states of incorporation, or they may inherently possess strong national loyalties. But such a body would at least be further removed from state political interests and face more political accountability at the international level, to the extent that the companies and research organizations involved conduct global operations.¹⁴² Most\n¹³⁸ Davis et al., RAND Corp., supra note 51, at 31; see Efrony, supra note 133 (“None of the experts should be simultaneously employed by governmental institutions to avoid even the appearance of conflicts of interest.”).\n¹³⁹ Davis et al., RAND Corp., supra note 51, at 31.\n¹⁴⁰ Id at 27, 33. To be clear, by using the term “attribution organization,” the suggestion is that the organization engages exclusively in attributional assessments. Unlike the proposals suggested by Microsoft and the Atlantic Council, it has no enforcement function. See Charney, Microsoft Corp., supra note 12, at 11; Jason Healey, et al., Atlantic Council, Confidence-Building Measures in Cyberspace: A Multistakeholder Approach for Stability and Security 10 (2014).\n¹⁴¹ Davis et al., RAND Corp., supra note 51, at 29; see also Efrony, supra note 133 (supporting the idea of excluding states from a global attribution body).\n¹⁴² Admittedly, “global operations” does not mean such operations will be equal among all states. One might argue that states with more sophisticated technology sectors could have more influence over the Consortium than states with less sophisticated technology sectors, since such countries will likely have stronger ties to members of the Consortium. But given the wide network of global interests and partnerships that states with sophisticated technology sectors have, which often tie them to states with smaller technology sectors, it is unlikely that the Consortium could or would privilege states along this line. Consider, for example, Russia’s collaborative interests with Iran, or the United States’ strong relationship with Afghanistan. Given this, the more relevant distinction may be between those states with friends and those without.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202\nLefebvre\nCracking Attribution\n\nJust being further removed from the risk of politicization, however, is not enough. The nature of the organization’s work requires not only a better reputation for neutrality than what could be accomplished with an intergovernmental organization, but an incredibly strong reputation for neutrality and expertise. This would, at a minimum, require geographic diversity from each of the sectors represented and strict transparency in both its governance and evaluation methodologies and procedures.¹⁴³ As RAND puts it, with no international norms to rely upon at present, the Consortium can only derive its legitimacy over time from “the reputation and credibility gained from the technical expertise of its diverse global membership and its commitment to objectivity and transparency in its attribution findings.”¹⁴⁴ To deliver on the promise of providing more reliable and transparent attributional assessments than what states have offered to date, the Consortium would need to include formalized conditions that trigger its review, standardized processes for evidence collection and assessment, attribution-confidence standards, procedures for notification and publication of results, and standardized procedures to assess the severity and sophistication of offensive operations.¹⁴⁵ Indeed, standardization and transparency are two crucial elements missing from the current diffuse attribution regime. As discussed, because of the lack of clear evidentiary standards, states at present have little incentive to be transparent in their technical analysis.¹⁴⁶ Further, even ¹⁴³ See Davis et al., RAND Corp., supra note 51, at 30.\n¹⁴⁴ Id.\n¹⁴⁵ Davis et al., RAND Corp., supra note 51, at 35.\n¹⁴⁶ See supra Section I.C.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202 Lefebvre Cracking Attribution ¹⁴⁷ See Davis et al., RAND Corp., supra note 51, at 20; Max Smeets, When Naming Cyber Threat Actors Does More Harm Than Good, Council on Foreign Relations: Blog (Oct. 24, 2016), https://www.cfr.org/blog/when-naming-cyber-threat-actors-does-more-harm-good (“First, if a competitor has already discovered a threat actor, the threat actor shouldn’t be renamed to fit another company’s branding.

While the Consortium would only begin an investigation at the request of the victim,¹⁵² the question remains, at least in some cases, as to which victim would have the proper standing to file a request with the Consortium.¹⁵³ For example, if an electrical utility suffers an attack on its infrastructure, does the state retain exclusive rights to trigger the investigation and publicize the results or should the utility company have the ability to file an investigation request? RAND suggests leaving such decisions up to the discretion of the Consortium.¹⁵⁴ But granting a private entity standing to bring an investigation request makes little sense, particularly given the consequences for the victim state if the operation were publicized and a state or non-state actor were accused. At the time of the request’s filing, there may be little clue as to the identity of the attacker. The risks of giving a private entity the right to publicize attacks and accuse another state with the Consortium’s platform and credibility behind its claim could cause significant difficulties for states in planning and conducting their international relations.¹⁵⁵ While private entities may be hesitant to report attacks to their host states—particularly if they might be liable in some way for the intrusion—these concerns make it more prudent to favor giving states exclusive standing to bring the claim and to publicize the results.\n¹⁵¹ Id. at 39.\n¹⁵² Id.\n¹⁵³ Id. at 36.\n¹⁵⁴ Id.\n¹⁵⁵ This concern resembles those that some have been expressed about claims made under the Alien Tort Statute and their potential to interfere with the foreign affairs of the United States.

Rev. 1117, 1119–20 (2011).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202 Lefebvre Cracking Attribution ¹⁵⁶ Even if the United States did not suffer a use of force or armed attack against its territorial integrity or political independence in this scenario, it was a victim of an Article 2(4) violation if one takes a somewhat broader conception of the provision. One state killing the nationals of another state would, at the very least, be activity “inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations.” U.N. Charter art. 2(4). Customary international law’s doctrine permitting the protection of nationals abroad seems to reflect that this is a sensible construction as does the principle of passive personality. See Restatement (Third) of the Foreign Relations Law of the U.S., § 402 cmt. g (Am. Law. Inst. 1987) (passive personality principle); Andrew W.R. Thomson, Doctrine of the Protection of Nationals Abroad: Rise of the Non-Combatant Evacuation Operation, 11 Wash. Univ. Global Studs. L. Rev. 627, 628–29 (2011) (protection of nationals abroad principle); see also 2 Vattel, The Law of Nations; or Principles of the Law of Nature; Applied to the Conduct and Affairs of Nations and Sovereigns § 71 (Joseph Chitty ed., Philadelphia, T.&amp;J.W.

While this is yet another area that the RAND proposal does not discuss with much depth, it would be sensible for the Consortium to provide the accused state with an advance copy of the Consortium’s report and an opportunity to rebut its conclusion and aspects of forensic report. This stage of the investigation could provide victim states with an opportunity to supplement the technical report from the Consortium’s forensic investigation with evidence gained through the victim state’s intelligence capabilities, such as from SIGINT and HUMINT, perhaps presenting such information to the Consortium in camera. To the extent a victim state is unwilling to share its intelligence with the Consortium, the only cost would be a lower confidence level in the attribution assessment than the Consortium would otherwise be able to provide. Alternatively, the Consortium might be able to release its forensic report and confidence assessment of the identity of the individual operators but provide a no-confidence or low-confidence assessment of state responsibility. Such a report would, at the very least, be valuable if the victim state chose to indict the operators under its domestic criminal law.¹⁵⁸ ¹⁵⁸ See, e.g., Press Release, U.S. Dep’t of Justice, North Korean Regime-Backed Programmer Charged with Conspiracy to Conduct Multiple Cyber Attacks and Intrusions (Sept. 6, 2018), https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/north-korean-regime-backed-programmer-charged-conspiracy-conduct-multiple-cyber-attacks-and.

Further, in the investigations it would accept, its technical capabilities could still help to fill the evidentiary gap that states face in justifying countermeasures or self-defense, especially where the victim state’s technical capabilities are lacking.\nTo the extent that states are able to point to an independent body’s declassified cyber forensic investigation, a state’s justification for countermeasures would be built on firmer factual ground than if it only had its classified intelligence to rely upon. With a reduced ability to hide behind a claim of pretextual or false accusation, states might exercise more caution in conducting offensive cyber operations or might restrict themselves to low-level uses of force so as not to draw attention of the Consortium.¹⁵⁹ This is true whether or not key players in the international community choose to submit a case to the Consortium. One may expect that the United States, China, Israel, or Russia may at first feel more comfortable relying upon the technical sophistication of their own intelligence communities to reliably identify culprits and might reject opening up the process to an independent body. But unlike with the political backing needed in a multilateral treaty, the Consortium could still provide much-needed technical assistance to less sophisticated middle-power and developing states that are targets of cyber attacks and exploitations, without the Conducting Coordinated Campaign of Cyber Attacks Against U.S. Financial Sector (March 24, 2016), https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/seven-iranians-working-islamic-revolutionary-guard-corps-affiliated-entities-charged; Press Release, U.S. Dep’t Justice, U.S. Charges Five Chinese Military Hackers for Cyber Espionage Against U.S. Corporations and a Labor Organization for Commercial Advantage, (May 19, 2014), https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/us-charges-five-chinese-military-hackers-cyber-espionage-against-us-corporations-and-labor.\n¹⁵⁹ At least part of the blame for the difficulties of deterring offensive cyber operations lies with the challenges in reliably attributing the operations to the correct culprit.

Rather than have states act as their own judges of how much proof is necessary to respond to an attack,¹⁶² states might feel they are obligated to justify their actions in the face of a quantifiable confidence metric.\nStates might also choose to reference such assessments in their domestic prosecutions of the accused individuals. The United States, for example, has issued indictments against a number of foreign officials and others who use cyber operations to threaten U.S. national security.¹⁶³ If other states had access to similar technical resources to attribute attacks with a high enough degree ¹⁶⁰ See U.N. Secretary-General, Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security 18, U.N. Doc. A/66/152 (July 15, 2011) (“[W]hile high-confidence attribution may be technically possible for states with sophisticated cyber operations, it is not always true of less capable states.”); Sheera Frankel, Hackers Find ‘Ideal Testing Ground’ for Attacks: Developing Countries, N.Y.

Of course, while the governments of superpowered states are not necessary, the talent that resides within their territory would be.\n¹⁶¹ See Efrony, supra note 133 (supporting the notion that if attribution is built on transparent and objective parameters, other states would follow it, contributing to state practice).\n¹⁶² See supra note 78 and accompanying text.\n¹⁶³ Ashley Deeks, Moving Forward on Cyber Norms, Domestically, Lawfare (July 10, 2017, 1:10PM) https://lawfareblog.com/moving-forward-cyber-norms-domestically; see, e.g., sources cited supra note 158.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202 Lefebvre Cracking Attribution\n\n## C. Challenges Ahead\nDespite the promise an independent non-governmental attribution body like the Consortium holds for building international norms, challenges remain for the Consortium’s effective execution. If independence is a key feature, from what sources could it responsibly derive funding? How will such a body prioritize its investigations and how will it deliver results quickly enough to meet the need for timely response that victim states will face? Further, without traditional sources of intelligence at hand, how will such a body meet the need to connect an operator’s activity with state direction and control in the case of state-sponsored attacks?\nRAND suggests initial funding from philanthropic sources and the inclusion of a charter mandate to seek funding from the United Nations at a later point.¹⁶⁶ RAND also points to the possibility of funding from cybersecurity and information technology companies that operate and defend much of the infrastructure upon which attacks are launched.¹⁶⁷ This might not be so far-fetched: if the Consortium were able to build a strong reputation in the international community,\n¹⁶⁴ Deeks, supra note 163.\n¹⁶⁵ See supra note 115.\n¹⁶⁶ Davis et al., RAND Corp., supra note 51, at 44.\n¹⁶⁷ Id. at 45.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202\nLefebvre\nCracking Attribution\n\nIf it could be done transparently, this Note suggests another solution: the Consortium might even charge clients fees for attribution services, in accordance with their ability to pay, basing its schedule off of the United Nations’ scale of assessments for the apportionment of its expenses.¹⁶⁸ Admittedly, this might introduce risks to its neutrality if the organization appears to demonstrate something akin to customer loyalty. If any attribution body were to accept fees for its services to offset its costs, its revenue streams would need to be diversified enough to prevent reliance on fees from any particular state, region, or global bloc.\nDeveloping prioritization policies may best be left to the discretion of the Consortium, given the variety of effects cyber attacks produce and the difficulty in organizing attacks by their severity. For example, the Consortium might be forced to choose between investigating a cyber attack that resulted in an explosion that killed tens of people or a ransomware attack that paralyzed the state’s ability to provide key services and cost its citizens and businesses hundreds of millions of dollars and maybe, indirectly, loss of life.¹⁶⁹ In this case, one might suggest investigating the former first, since the victim state in that case would have suffered an armed attack under the effects test¹⁷⁰ and would have the right to respond in self-defense, if such measures were necessary to prevent future attacks.¹⁷¹ However, one can imagine murkier cases where the severity might be tied to the degree of harm suffered by the victim. For example, two ostensibly different attacks on two different central bank accounts might result in the same amount of money lost, but one of ¹⁶⁸ Cf. G.A. Res. 70/245 (December 23, 2015) (detailing the U.N. scale of assessments).\n¹⁶⁹ Cf. supra note 6–7 and accompanying text (detailing cyber attacks that either did or would have resulted in similar damage).\n¹⁷⁰ Tallinn Manual 2.0, supra note 1, at 340–41.\n¹⁷¹ U.N. Charter, art. 51.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202 Lefebvre Cracking Attribution Even if the Consortium were able to develop severity prioritization rules, the body might not be able to complete the investigation in a timely enough fashion for a state to respond. If a state continues to suffer armed attacks or uses of force, the victim might need to respond with self-defense measures under Article 51 or enact countermeasures in order to bring the culprit back into compliance with its international obligations. In such a situation, the Consortium might be able to release preliminary findings at a lower confidence level. Acting on any such findings could operate under a “buyer beware” framework, a concept that would tie nicely with the sliding-scale evidentiary framework proposed in Section I.C.¹⁷² Over time, international norms—and perhaps, eventually, customary international law—could be built around the level of confidence expected from attributional assessments before a state could pursue countermeasures, invoke pleas of necessity, or undertake acts of self-defense. The Consortium’s findings would make the adoption of this sliding-scale evidentiary framework more easily possible, since the findings would provide a quantifiable, standardized, and easily referenced confidence level for the international community to debate. Over time, this transparency could help develop international law’s standards of proof by providing more transparent examples of state practice, leading to easier identification of the *opinio juris* needed to locate customary international law. For example, one might find, after mapping the Consortium’s confidence levels of its attribution assessments to the corresponding state responses, that states are only willing to enact countermeasures on confidence levels of fifty percent or higher and self-defense measures on confidence levels of seventy-five percent or higher.\n¹⁷² See supra note 109–111 and accompanying text.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202 Lefebvre Cracking Attribution Perhaps the most significant challenge facing the Consortium is the ostensibly low likelihood that competing tech companies would come together to participate in the organization. But there are reasons to think that prominent players in the tech sector would be more interested than some might suppose.

While multilateral treaties and international cooperation might be the preferred avenue to overcome them, current trends provide little hope for the success of such options. Despite this, the development of customary international law provides an opportunity to push forward in regulating state behavior surrounding cyberspace. This Note demonstrates how an attributional body like the Consortium stands to provide substantial benefit to the development of these norms by providing states with a transparent and independent mechanism upon which to build evidentiary standards, such as the sliding-scale evidentiary framework, to undergird countermeasures and acts of self-defense. In this way, the international community can make more consistent judgments about state action in response to offensive cyber operations. While this may provide less flexibility for states to act in the face of such operations than what is nearly guaranteed through today's system of opaque unilateral evidentiary assessments, such restrictions on state behavior would benefit the international community at large by increasing global stability. Further, adopting this Note's version of a sliding-scale approach to the standard of proof—one where the standard fluctuates based on the response a victim wishes to undertake—should accommodate the flexibility states need when attempting to respond to quickly to a cyber attack.\nBy offering both victim states and the accused the opportunity to obtain an independent, sophisticated, and quantifiable attributional assessment, a body like the Consortium could help alleviate the deterrence difficulties inherent in a low-confidence attribution landscape and reduce the risk that states escalate or begin conflicts with parties that have no relation to the conflict. Questions persist regarding sources of funding for the Consortium, its operational efficiency in light of the need for quick responses to severe offensive operations, and the remaining difficulty Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202 Lefebvre Cracking Attribution Whatever the case, the world will not stand still in the cyber landscape. If international law is to be of any value in restricting dangerous state behavior in this arena, its development must push forward. States can still do their part to gradually advance international norms by responsibly conducting their own cyber practices and related behavior in an effort to shape customary international law. An independent non-governmental attributional body like the Consortium provides a powerful launchpad for them to do just that.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202"

Conventional Parallels\n\nThe difficulty in linking attacks to the identity of the attacker is not a new problem for international law: states have struggled with making such determinations for centuries. This is true where another state has been the attacker, where a non-state actor acting under its own direction has been the attacker, and where state proxies acting under the direction of a sponsoring state have been the source of the attacks. Some commentators have drawn parallels between today’s challenges in policing cyberspace to those created by the state use of privateers on the high seas in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.²⁴ Florian Egloff notes how both the high seas through that period and cyberspace involve a range of actors, each with varying degrees of direction and control from a sponsoring state.²⁵ Between these two different eras and environments, the parallels between state actors, semi-state actors, and non-state actors can be readily drawn: respectively, consider the similarities between formal navies and cyber military units, privateers and today’s “patriotic hackers,”²⁶ or even pirates and most modern cybercriminals or cybercrime organizations.²⁷\n²³ See infra note 66.\n²⁴ Florian Egloff, Cybersecurity and the Age of Privateering, in Understanding Cyber Conflict: 14 Analogies 231, (George Perkovich &amp; Ariel E.

While technical attribution capabilities are increasing for many states, including the United States, the identification of the machine or machines used in carrying out the attack, their operators, or even the geographic locations of the machines and their operators is not always enough when making a determination of state responsibility.³⁶ Yet the stakes are high. If the injured state responds to a wrongful act under international law³⁷ with a countermeasure aimed at a wrongly accused state, then the injured state has then committed an internationally wrongful act by engaging in countermeasures against an innocent state.³⁸ Simply put, the international legal framework currently in place for responding to uses of force, armed attacks, and other breaches of international obligations cannot function properly without reliable attributional assessments, regardless of whether the unlawful action occurs in the context of a cyber or a traditional physical operation.³⁹ ³⁴ Id.\n³⁵ See Banks, supra note 2, at 1493 (describing some of the technical challenges posed by cyber attacks and exploitations).\n³⁶ Banks, supra note 2, at 1502.

Once the operation’s conductors have gained access to the desired system, they attempt to take advantage of the system to plant code, known as malware,⁴¹ that will destroy or degrade the intruded system, exfiltrate information from the system, or both.⁴² Cyber operations pose significant and unique challenges in the evidentiary context as it relates to both the identity of the operator and attribution to a state. This is in part because the operations are “opaque to public view, technically very complex and likely to emerge piecemeal,” unlike conventional kinetic attacks, which are visible and “can be and often are broadcast widely, immediately, and understandably [and, further, the] common experience [of such attacks] makes ⁴⁰ See Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua (Nicar. v.

HUMINT includes sources such as interviews with recruited foreign agents.

Building a Private Body for a Public Good\n\nIn 2017, researchers at the RAND Corporation published a white paper proposing the creation of an attributional organization that would exclude states from its management and operation, referring to the proposed body as the “Global Cyber Attribution Consortium” (“the Consortium”).¹⁴⁰ Instead of states, RAND proposes that the body be managed and operated by cyberspace legal and policy experts, international policy experts from academia and research organizations, and technical experts from academia as well as cybersecurity and information technology companies.¹⁴¹ RAND recognizes that these actors are not immune to politicization: they may face pressures from their home markets or states of incorporation, or they may inherently possess strong national loyalties. But such a body would at least be further removed from state political interests and face more political accountability at the international level, to the extent that the companies and research organizations involved conduct global operations.¹⁴² Most\n¹³⁸ Davis et al., RAND Corp., supra note 51, at 31; see Efrony, supra note 133 (“None of the experts should be simultaneously employed by governmental institutions to avoid even the appearance of conflicts of interest.”).\n¹³⁹ Davis et al., RAND Corp., supra note 51, at 31.\n¹⁴⁰ Id at 27, 33. To be clear, by using the term “attribution organization,” the suggestion is that the organization engages exclusively in attributional assessments. Unlike the proposals suggested by Microsoft and the Atlantic Council, it has no enforcement function. See Charney, Microsoft Corp., supra note 12, at 11; Jason Healey, et al., Atlantic Council, Confidence-Building Measures in Cyberspace: A Multistakeholder Approach for Stability and Security 10 (2014).\n¹⁴¹ Davis et al., RAND Corp., supra note 51, at 29; see also Efrony, supra note 133 (supporting the idea of excluding states from a global attribution body).\n¹⁴² Admittedly, “global operations” does not mean such operations will be equal among all states. One might argue that states with more sophisticated technology sectors could have more influence over the Consortium than states with less sophisticated technology sectors, since such countries will likely have stronger ties to members of the Consortium. But given the wide network of global interests and partnerships that states with sophisticated technology sectors have, which often tie them to states with smaller technology sectors, it is unlikely that the Consortium could or would privilege states along this line. Consider, for example, Russia’s collaborative interests with Iran, or the United States’ strong relationship with Afghanistan. Given this, the more relevant distinction may be between those states with friends and those without.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202\nLefebvre\nCracking Attribution\nJust being further removed from the risk of politicization, however, is not enough. The nature of the organization’s work requires not only a better reputation for neutrality than what could be accomplished with an intergovernmental organization, but an incredibly strong reputation for neutrality and expertise. This would, at a minimum, require geographic diversity from each of the sectors represented and strict transparency in both its governance and evaluation methodologies and procedures.¹⁴³ As RAND puts it, with no international norms to rely upon at present, the Consortium can only derive its legitimacy over time from “the reputation and credibility gained from the technical expertise of its diverse global membership and its commitment to objectivity and transparency in its attribution findings.”¹⁴⁴ To deliver on the promise of providing more reliable and transparent attributional assessments than what states have offered to date, the Consortium would need to include formalized conditions that trigger its review, standardized processes for evidence collection and assessment, attribution-confidence standards, procedures for notification and publication of results, and standardized procedures to assess the severity and sophistication of offensive operations.¹⁴⁵ Indeed, standardization and transparency are two crucial elements missing from the current diffuse attribution regime. As discussed, because of the lack of clear evidentiary standards, states at present have little incentive to be transparent in their technical analysis.¹⁴⁶ Further, even ¹⁴³ See Davis et al., RAND Corp., supra note 51, at 30.\n¹⁴⁴ Id.\n¹⁴⁵ Davis et al., RAND Corp., supra note 51, at 35.\n¹⁴⁶ See supra Section I.C.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202 Lefebvre Cracking Attribution ¹⁴⁷ See Davis et al., RAND Corp., supra note 51, at 20; Max Smeets, When Naming Cyber Threat Actors Does More Harm Than Good, Council on Foreign Relations: Blog (Oct. 24, 2016), https://www.cfr.org/blog/when-naming-cyber-threat-actors-does-more-harm-good (“First, if a competitor has already discovered a threat actor, the threat actor shouldn’t be renamed to fit another company’s branding.

While the Consortium would only begin an investigation at the request of the victim,¹⁵² the question remains, at least in some cases, as to which victim would have the proper standing to file a request with the Consortium.¹⁵³ For example, if an electrical utility suffers an attack on its infrastructure, does the state retain exclusive rights to trigger the investigation and publicize the results or should the utility company have the ability to file an investigation request? RAND suggests leaving such decisions up to the discretion of the Consortium.¹⁵⁴ But granting a private entity standing to bring an investigation request makes little sense, particularly given the consequences for the victim state if the operation were publicized and a state or non-state actor were accused. At the time of the request’s filing, there may be little clue as to the identity of the attacker. The risks of giving a private entity the right to publicize attacks and accuse another state with the Consortium’s platform and credibility behind its claim could cause significant difficulties for states in planning and conducting their international relations.¹⁵⁵ While private entities may be hesitant to report attacks to their host states—particularly if they might be liable in some way for the intrusion—these concerns make it more prudent to favor giving states exclusive standing to bring the claim and to publicize the results.\n¹⁵¹ Id. at 39.\n¹⁵² Id.\n¹⁵³ Id. at 36.\n¹⁵⁴ Id.\n¹⁵⁵ This concern resembles those that some have been expressed about claims made under the Alien Tort Statute and their potential to interfere with the foreign affairs of the United States.

One state killing the nationals of another state would, at the very least, be activity “inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations.” U.N. Charter art. 2(4). Customary international law’s doctrine permitting the protection of nationals abroad seems to reflect that this is a sensible construction as does the principle of passive personality. See Restatement (Third) of the Foreign Relations Law of the U.S., § 402 cmt. g (Am. Law. Inst. 1987) (passive personality principle); Andrew W.R. Thomson, Doctrine of the Protection of Nationals Abroad: Rise of the Non-Combatant Evacuation Operation, 11 Wash. Univ. Global Studs. L.

While this is yet another area that the RAND proposal does not discuss with much depth, it would be sensible for the Consortium to provide the accused state with an advance copy of the Consortium’s report and an opportunity to rebut its conclusion and aspects of forensic report. This stage of the investigation could provide victim states with an opportunity to supplement the technical report from the Consortium’s forensic investigation with evidence gained through the victim state’s intelligence capabilities, such as from SIGINT and HUMINT, perhaps presenting such information to the Consortium in camera. To the extent a victim state is unwilling to share its intelligence with the Consortium, the only cost would be a lower confidence level in the attribution assessment than the Consortium would otherwise be able to provide. Alternatively, the Consortium might be able to release its forensic report and confidence assessment of the identity of the individual operators but provide a no-confidence or low-confidence assessment of state responsibility. Such a report would, at the very least, be valuable if the victim state chose to indict the operators under its domestic criminal law.¹⁵⁸ ¹⁵⁸ See, e.g., Press Release, U.S. Dep’t of Justice, North Korean Regime-Backed Programmer Charged with Conspiracy to Conduct Multiple Cyber Attacks and Intrusions (Sept. 6, 2018), https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/north-korean-regime-backed-programmer-charged-conspiracy-conduct-multiple-cyber-attacks-and.

Further, in the investigations it would accept, its technical capabilities could still help to fill the evidentiary gap that states face in justifying countermeasures or self-defense, especially where the victim state’s technical capabilities are lacking.\nTo the extent that states are able to point to an independent body’s declassified cyber forensic investigation, a state’s justification for countermeasures would be built on firmer factual ground than if it only had its classified intelligence to rely upon. With a reduced ability to hide behind a claim of pretextual or false accusation, states might exercise more caution in conducting offensive cyber operations or might restrict themselves to low-level uses of force so as not to draw attention of the Consortium.¹⁵⁹ This is true whether or not key players in the international community choose to submit a case to the Consortium. One may expect that the United States, China, Israel, or Russia may at first feel more comfortable relying upon the technical sophistication of their own intelligence communities to reliably identify culprits and might reject opening up the process to an independent body.

    "# CRACKING ATTRIBUTION: MOVING INTERNATIONAL NORMS FORWARD\n\nJoshua Lefebvre\n\nThis Note addresses how international law can meet the challenge of reliably and transparently identifying the actor responsible for a cyber attack, a feature of the cyber landscape referred to as the “attribution problem.” It examines the potential for customary international law to define evidentiary standards for evaluating claims of a cyber attacker’s identity, standards which would have to be met before a state victim could retaliate. Such a framework would replace the malleable and opaque ad hoc determinations of responsibility that states currently undertake in both the conventional force and the cyber contexts alike. To this end, this Note introduces a sliding-scale evidentiary standard that adapts to the—often limited—availability of evidence and short amount of time a victim might have to respond to cyber attacks.\n\nThis Note analogizes to attribution problems faced by the international community in the past, such as piracy and privateering on the eighteenth century’s high seas, to demonstrate that the legal problems posed by cyber capabilities are not unfamiliar. But the ubiquity of cyber capabilities and diffuse nature of the cyber landscape mean that the solution must be different. This Note demonstrates that a newly proposed non-governmental attribution body, structured like a tribunal, could meet the tremendous need many victims face in gathering the evidence to overcome the attribution problem inherent to cyberspace. Such a body, this Note argues, provides the best launchpad for developing the international norms—and, eventually, the customary international law—needed to build evidentiary standards in the cyber context.\n\nINTRODUCTION ... 1\n\nI.

    "# INTRODUCTION\n\nEach year, state and non-state cyber capabilities increase in sophistication while attack surfaces widen, and yet, international law has not kept pace. Treaties dealing directly with cyber operations are scarce in number and limited in scope.¹ State cyber practices are held close to the chest and, although their publicly available expressions are increasing, there are still too few to constitute well-defined norms to develop comprehensive customary international law.² While it at least seems clear today that existing principles of international law apply in cyberspace,³ states—perhaps as a result of their own strategic caution⁴—have, at present, left to the academy and non-governmental bodies much of the task of determining how such principles apply.⁵ Against this hazy legal backdrop, states and non-state actors alike have wasted no time in deploying cyber attacks and exploitations of ever more destructive and exploitative power. In June 2017, according to the U.S. government, the Russian military launched “the most destructive and costly cyber attack in history,” using ransomware dubbed “NotPetya” to cause billions of dollars in damage across Europe, the Americas, and Asia.⁶ Just two months later, in August 2017, a petrochemical plant in Saudi Arabia suffered a cyber attack that was designed to trigger an explosion that likely\n\n¹ Introduction to International Governmental Group of Experts, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations 3 (Michael N.

    "Lefebvre\nCracking Attribution\n3\n\nremains a critical obstacle in applying key aspects of the U.N. Charter and core principles of customary international law, such as state sovereignty and non-intervention.¹¹\n\nThis Note begins in Part I by defining the attribution problem and identifying the factual challenges it poses for dealing with offensive cyber operations. It then explores the evidentiary framework by which attribution claims in both the conventional and cyber context are measured. In doing so, it attempts to identify and help fill the gap in the academic literature surrounding what standards of proof are and should be expected to be met under international law. Toward this end, it introduces a novel application of a sliding scale of proof, one tied to the severity of the victim’s response rather than solely to the underlying breach of international law. Part I then concludes by providing a brief overview of how principles of state responsibility apply in cyberspace.\n\nPart II identifies a number of the proposed solutions to the attribution problem suggested in the literature—such as intergovernmental inspection and compliance bodies as well as multilateral treaties—and explains why they are inadequate in the cyber context or are unlikely to come about. It then critiques and builds upon the solution highlighted by this Note: a non-governmental global consortium of representatives from private companies, academia, and think tanks that assesses available forensic evidence to provide an attributional assessment for victims of cyber attack or exploitation.¹² But the value of this organization does not just lie in its ability to provide a much-needed leader for neutral and capable technical investigations. Rather, it has significant potential to lay the groundwork for the proposed sliding-scale evidentiary framework’s\n\n¹¹ See Waxman, supra note 4, at 426.\n¹² While this Note recognizes the benefits of solutions that propose an intergovernmental organization to govern cyber capability use and compliance, akin to the International Atomic Energy Agency (“IAEA”), see, e.g., Scott Charney et al., Microsoft Corp., From Articulation to Implementation: Enabling Progress on Cybersecurity Norms 11 (2016), it also recognizes that states are highly unlikely in today’s toxic geopolitical environment to agree to allow representatives from foreign governments to inspect some of their most closely held secrets. Further, significant doubts might arise as to the neutrality of governmental representatives serving in the body’s management and operational roles, risking the legitimacy and independence of the body’s assessments.\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202",

And perhaps just as significant, the quality of the organization's attributional assessments carry great promise for their potential to shape state practice toward an expectation of higher quality attributional claims against other states.\n\nRather than have states judge for themselves how much proof is necessary to respond to an attack,¹³ this Note argues that states might feel obligated to justify their actions in the face of a quantifiable confidence metric, one that could be provided by the proposed non-governmental attribution body. Through reference to the attributional assessment of a neutral and sophisticated body, a state's self-defense¹⁴ and countermeasure¹⁵ activities could rest on a firmer and more transparent evidentiary foundation. In this way, this Note makes the novel suggestion that this non-governmental organization could serve as the best launchpad for developing customary international law to build evidentiary standards in the cyber context.\n\n## I. DEFINING THE ATTRIBUTION PROBLEM AND ITS SCOPE\n\nThe attribution problem is often viewed as a technical challenge with a technical solution: the tools of offensive cyber operations make it easy to hide one's identity from a victim, so would-be victims need to build cyber defensive capabilities and cyber forensic investigative capabilities to overcome this challenge. But the limitations of cyber defensive and investigative capabilities can and do pose obstacles to the application of international law. Principally, they foreground the question of how a state could respond lawfully under international law if it does not know against whom it should respond. The immensity of this problem, however, overshadows the subsequent\n\n¹³ See infra note 78 and accompanying text.\n¹⁴ This Note keys the term “self-defense” to its meaning under Article 51 of the U.N. Charter, limiting it to a victim state’s uses of force taken against an aggressor state in response to an armed attack. U.N. Charter, art. 51.\n¹⁵ In this Note, the term “countermeasures” is used as a term of art. It refers to actions taken by a victim state that amount to a breach of its international obligations vis-à-vis an aggressor state. Such actions must be taken with the goal of bringing the aggressor state back into compliance with its international obligations vis-à-vis the victim state and cannot exceed what is necessary and proportionate to effectuate that goal. Without the preceding act of aggression, these actions would otherwise be considered unlawful. Int’l. L. Comm’n, Rep. on the Work of its Fifty-Third Session, U.N. Doc.

Together, international law’s lack of evidentiary standards for evaluating a victim’s identification of an attacker and the limited availability of evidence to meet such standards compound the challenges cyber capabilities pose, severely hampering international law’s application and development in cyberspace.¹⁶\n\nThis Part addresses both of these obstacles. It demonstrates why reliable, standardized, and transparent determinations of a cyber attacker’s identity—referred to throughout this Note as “attributional assessments” or “attributional claims”—are necessary to the successful application of international law’s principles to cyberspace, and it evaluates how customary international law could be developed to meet this end. Toward this effort, Section I.C addresses a relative gap in the literature by assessing what standard of proof is and should be necessary when making an attributional claim.\n\nFor the purposes of this Note, “attribution” is tied to identity, rather than an action’s particular cause. In this context, attribution refers to the process of determining the “identity or location of an attacker or an attacker’s intermediary.”¹⁷ To qualify as an interstate attributional claim, the identity of the attack or exploitation’s independent operators must be connected with customary international law’s principles of state responsibility, largely reflected in the second Tallinn Manual and discussed in Section I.D.¹⁸ Ultimately, once the technical assessment of the\n\n¹⁶ Waxman, supra note 4, at 426 (“[T]he low visibility of states’ moves and countermoves in cyberspace will slow the process of interpretive development . . . .

This Note distinguishes a cyber attack from a cyber exploitation by defining the former as operations that “target one of several attributes of systems or networks and seeks to cause a loss of integrity, a loss of authenticity, or a loss of availability, which includes theft of services.”²⁰ The term “cyber exploitation” is used to refer to operations that target only the “confidentiality of information stored on or passing through a system or network.”²¹ The two terms are collectively referred to as “offensive cyber operations” throughout the piece.\n\nWhile attribution of cyber attacks and exploitations presents problems for domestic criminal law enforcement and international law alike, this Part, and indeed this Note, will focus primarily on the attribution problem as it relates to international law.

Conventional Parallels\n\nThe difficulty in linking attacks to the identity of the attacker is not a new problem for international law: states have struggled with making such determinations for centuries. This is true where another state has been the attacker, where a non-state actor acting under its own direction has been the attacker, and where state proxies acting under the direction of a sponsoring state have been the source of the attacks. Some commentators have drawn parallels between today’s challenges in policing cyberspace to those created by the state use of privateers on the high seas in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.²⁴ Florian Egloff notes how both the high seas through that period and cyberspace involve a range of actors, each with varying degrees of direction and control from a sponsoring state.²⁵ Between these two different eras and environments, the parallels between state actors, semi-state actors, and non-state actors can be readily drawn: respectively, consider the similarities between formal navies and cyber military units, privateers and today’s “patriotic hackers,”²⁶ or even pirates and most modern cybercriminals or cybercrime organizations.²⁷\n\n²³ See infra note 66.\n\n²⁴ Florian Egloff, Cybersecurity and the Age of Privateering, in Understanding Cyber Conflict: 14 Analogies 231, (George Perkovich &amp; Ariel E.

    "Lefebvre\nCracking Attribution\n8\n\nSimilar to attackers in cyberspace, privateers were able to shift their identity and locale with ease, creating ambiguity around the identity of the sponsoring state or a question of whether there was any sponsor state at all.²⁸ This ambiguity provided plausible deniability to states for violence carried out through privateering. In large part, it is not unlike that provided to modern states by “patriotic hackers” or other non-state actors in cyberspace who act with impunity in a harboring state, if not the state’s explicit sponsorship.²⁹ To deal with the difficulties arising out of this ambiguity, state practice led to expectations—and, eventually, customary international law—that privateers would post their true flags before firing a shot from across the bow in order to seize another ship for search, despite allowing false flags to be flown while chasing a vessel.³⁰ While this helped to mitigate the attribution difficulties that arose, they were not entirely resolved until privateering fell out of use after it was abolished by multilateral treaty in 1856.³¹\n\nMore modern comparisons are often drawn to the Cold War, where attribution and causality issues frequently arose in the context of Article 2(4) of the U.N.

While technical attribution capabilities are increasing for many states, including the United States, the identification of the machine or machines used in carrying out the attack, their operators, or even the geographic locations of the machines and their operators is not always enough when making a determination of state responsibility.³⁶ Yet the stakes are high. If the injured state responds to a wrongful act under international law³⁷ with a countermeasure aimed at a wrongly accused state, then the injured state has then committed an internationally wrongful act by engaging in countermeasures against an innocent state.³⁸ Simply put, the international legal framework currently in place for responding to uses of force, armed attacks, and other breaches of international obligations cannot function properly without reliable attributional assessments, regardless of whether the unlawful action occurs in the context of a cyber or a traditional physical operation.³⁹\n\n³⁴ Id.\n\n³⁵ See Banks, supra note 2, at 1493 (describing some of the technical challenges posed by cyber attacks and exploitations).\n\n³⁶ Banks, supra note 2, at 1502.

The Factual Challenge of Attribution\n\nAttribution of interstate cyber operations—like operations in the conventional kinetic context—can be broken down into two components: (1) the identity of the individual operators who carried out the operation; and (2) the relationship those operators have, if any, to any given state.⁴⁰ These two components comprise factual inquiries, of course, into what machines were used to carry out an attack, who operated them, and who directed or controlled those operators for purposes of the operation.\n\nAt the most basic level, an offensive cyber operation involves one or more individuals, often acting remotely, who interfaces with one or more computers or entire networks—usually by means of programming code—in order to gain access to the targeted systems through hardware or software security vulnerabilities or through fraudulent credentials. Once the operation’s conductors have gained access to the desired system, they attempt to take advantage of the system to plant code, known as malware,⁴¹ that will destroy or degrade the intruded system, exfiltrate information from the system, or both.⁴²\n\nCyber operations pose significant and unique challenges in the evidentiary context as it relates to both the identity of the operator and attribution to a state. This is in part because the operations are “opaque to public view, technically very complex and likely to emerge piecemeal,” unlike conventional kinetic attacks, which are visible and “can be and often are broadcast widely, immediately, and understandably [and, further, the] common experience [of such attacks] makes\n\n⁴⁰ See Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua (Nicar. v.

But given its willingness to provide some evidence publicly and share significant amounts of intelligence with allies, one might suppose that this burden is not insubstantial. Despite the difference between cyber operations and chemical attacks—which, particularly due to the sheer complexity of handling chemical agents like Novichoks, carry less plausible deniability than an actor would have in an offensive cyber operation—the evidentiary problems in the international arena are strikingly similar.\n\n1. Is There an Attribution Standard for Cyberspace Under International Law?\n\nIn the cyber context, the answers to the evidentiary questions are even more underdeveloped due to the paucity of transparent state practice and *opinio juris*—a term that refers to a state’s sense of legal obligation—in making public attributional statements for offensive cyber operations.⁷⁶ In its 2015 report, the U.N. Group of Governmental Experts acknowledged that attribution claims for cyber operations “should be substantiated.” But the report failed to articulate how much or what type of evidence is necessary for states to justify countermeasures or acts of self-defense under international law, or even whether such claims must be substantiated publicly.⁷⁷ The United States has gone one step further in articulating its position on the matter in remarks made in November 2016 by then-U.S. Department of State Legal Adviser Brian Egan:\n\n⁷⁶ See Tallinn Manual 2.0, supra note 1, at 83.

    "Lefebvre\nCracking Attribution\n18\n\nThe law of state responsibility does not set forth explicit burdens or standards of proof for making a determination about legal attribution. In this context, a State acts as its own judge of the facts and may make a unilateral determination with respect to attribution of a cyber operation to another State. Absolute certainty is not—and cannot be—required. Instead, international law generally requires that States act reasonably under the circumstances when they gather information and draw conclusions based on that information.78\n\nThe IGE understands this “reasonableness” standard as involving an examination of whether states have considered, among other factors, the reliability, quantum, directness, nature, and specificity of the relevant information available to the injured state in light of attendant circumstances and the importance of the right involved.79 While these factors are fairly malleable, the method is not dissimilar from the “ad hoc” way in which states evaluate factual claims in the conventional force context.80\n\nAs to whether the reasonableness standard includes the obligation to publicly disclose the evidence on which an attribution claim has been made, the IGE was of the opinion that there is not enough state practice or *opinio juris* to evidence such a requirement under customary international law.81 This insufficiency is, in large part, a result of the highly classified nature of cyber capabilities, whether used offensively, defensively, or as part of a forensic investigation.82 Conceivably, this could change as more forensic analysis of cyber operations is conducted by\n\n78 Brian J.

It is worth noting that Egan’s statement may be a step forward, but it does not amount to much. No state could possibly expect absolute certainty given the difficulties surrounding attribution of offensive cyber operations. By settling on a requirement of “reasonableness,” the statement begs the question it is trying to answer, since such “reasonableness” can run the gamut in terms of what it could require.\n\n79 Tallinn Manual 2.0, supra note 1, at 82 (noting, in addition, that the available information considered need not be restricted to technical intelligence if it can be supplemented with highly reliable human intelligence).\n\n80 See Jules Lobel, Colloquy, The Use of Force to Respond to Terrorist Attacks: The Bombing of Sudan and Afghanistan, 24 Yale J.

Does International Law Already Contain a General Attribution Standard?\n\nDrawing from the above, it would seem that, at present, no state under international law carries an obligation of publicly proving its attributional claim by revealing the available evidence, whether that be in the cyber or conventional force context.⁸⁸ Nor does it seem that states carry a well-defined burden under international law related to the quality or amount of evidence used in proving an attributional claim before undertaking acts of self-defense or countermeasures against the accused state.⁸⁹ Further, strikingly few commentators have even addressed the issue of evidentiary burdens under international law. But despite the IGE’s findings and the claims that states like the United States have made about (non-)obligations under international law, there is a contingent of those few who have argued the contrary. Such commentators claim that sufficient state practice exists to locate the standard of proof required of attribution claims.⁹⁰\n\nProfessor Mary Ellen O’Connell has argued that, at least in situations in which states are justifying the use of force under Article 51’s self-defense provision, state practice and the decisions of international courts and tribunals support a “clear and convincing” standard in evaluating evidence.⁹¹ She claims that “the international authority for the standard consists of several\n\n⁸⁸ See also Banks, supra note 2, at 1499 (“Applying the Rules on State Responsibility and attribution compiled in Tallinn 2.0, there is no burden of proof or requirement that there exists definitive information on attribution.

Bush, and the 1998 bombing of Sudan and Afghanistan after attacks on U.S. embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam.⁹² Professor O’Connell’s evidence for such claims raises questions, however, about whether such an obligation truly exists under international law.\n\nFirst, while she cites examples of state practice of injured states using language indicating that they are in possession of “clear,” “compelling,” or “convincing” evidence of having suffered an internationally wrongful act at the hand of a particular state, there is no indication that this is done out of a sense of legal obligation.⁹³ State practice on its own is insufficient to establish customary international law; it is only when it is done out of a sense of legal obligation, or *opinio juris*, that it can be considered customary international law. Further, the fact that she only cites U.S. practice draws into question whether one state’s practice is enough, even if the United States were acting out of a sense of legal obligation. Lastly, the United States and any number of other states have a multitude of political reasons to indicate that they are in possession of “clear” or “convincing” evidence. There is no suggestion that such states believe that this is an evidentiary floor that must be met under international law before they can act on the evidence in their possession.\n\n⁹² O’Connell, supra note 31, at 23–28.\n⁹³ But see Mark Landler &amp; Michael R.

    "Lefebvre\nCracking Attribution\n22\n\nWhile Professor O'Connell and other commentators cite implicit standards of proof in the International Court of Justice’s (“ICJ”) rulings, among other international courts and tribunals,⁹⁴ there is no indication that the ICJ’s procedural standards have any bearing on claims that appear in front of other bodies or that such standards reflect customary international law. The ICJ’s opinion in the Nicaragua case, which these commentators claim supports a “clear and convincing” standard,⁹⁵ suggests that its standard of proof derives from Article 53 of the Statute on the International Court of Justice,⁹⁶ which does not purport to have impact outside of the operations of that court.⁹⁷ Further, O'Connell’s evidence that the ICJ uses a “clear and compelling” standard of proof is limited to consistent references to whether evidence is “sufficient” or “insufficient.”⁹⁸ But declaring whether a particular amount of evidence is sufficient is distinct from whether it is necessary. Indeed, the ICJ’s opinion merely points to the fact that evidence has met or surpassed the necessary standard of proof; it does not indicate what that standard is. While the ICJ does mention that its findings of fact should be based upon “convincing” evidence, it includes a caveat: that it should only do so to the extent that “the nature of the case permits.”⁹⁹ This seems to suggest a shifting standard of proof, determined on the basis of the availability and nature of the facts.\n\nProfessors Robin Geiß and Henning Lahmann make similar claims about the standard of proof in the Oil Platforms and Armed Attacks cases, claiming the ICJ uses an implicit “clear and convincing” standard.¹⁰⁰ But again, the ICJ in the Oil Platforms case merely refers to the\n\n⁹⁴ O'Connell, supra note 68, at 23–24; Geiß &amp; Lahmann, supra note 90, at 624; see also Marco Roscini, Symposium, Evidentiary Issues Related to Cyber Operations, 50 Tex.

Indeed, the ICJ’s proceedings only require enough proof to “satisfy” the ICJ in law and in fact, a rather flexible standard.¹⁰³ Conceivably, as the ICJ suggested in its decision in the Nicaragua case, the ICJ may find itself satisfied with applying different standards of proof in different contexts, depending on the amount of evidence available or the difficulty in proving particular claims. This makes it even more difficult to make an inference about the standard it is using to judge the facts before it.¹⁰⁴ Particularly since there is little state practice and no apparent opinio juris to support a standard of proof for state attribution claims against other states for a breach of an international obligation,¹⁰⁵ any inferences about the standard of proof used by the ICJ appear to be cabined to that international body.¹⁰⁶ This only becomes clearer when one considers that the ICJ derives its power to set a standard of proof from its foundational statute.

The Value of a Sliding-Scale Attribution Standard\n\nThe absence of a standard of proof in these matters may be surprising, but it is likely—at least in part—a reflection of the reluctance among nations to share closely guarded intelligence methods on a global stage in front of ally and adversary alike.¹⁰⁸ There is little doubt, however, that developing international norms to establish a standard of proof for attributional claims before undertaking countermeasures or self-defense measures would force states to exercise restraint in using these tools. One would hope that such restraint could help prevent conflicts from escalating or even spilling over into wrongly accused states that had no previous role in a particular conflict.¹⁰⁹ Problems arise, though, in determining how high such a standard should be for cyber operations, given the difficulty many states face in being able to make an attributional claim with a high degree of confidence in a short amount of time. Any standard of proof employed should be sufficiently flexible to allow a state to act quickly enough for its countermeasures to serve as an adequate means of forcing the offending state back into compliance with its international\n\n¹⁰⁷ See Statute of the International Court of Justice, June 26, 1945, art. 53(2), 59 Stat. 1055, 1062, T.S. No. 993.\n\n¹⁰⁸ The reluctance, of course, is not unfounded. Sharing intelligence with adversaries can better clue them into the methods of the victim state’s intelligence collection, helping adversaries to better identify their own security vulnerabilities. For one example of how providing intelligence can change an adversary’s behavior in a way that threatens a state’s national security, see Eric Schmitt &amp; Michael S. Schmidt, *Queda Plot Leak Has Undermined U.S. Intelligence*, N.Y.

Such difficulty might be resolved by applying a shifting standard of proof, not unlike what the ICJ appears to employ based upon “the nature of the case.”\n\nA standard of proof tied to the anticipated severity of the victim state’s response rather than to the severity of the underlying breach might meet the goals of timely response while adapting to the lower quality and quantity of evidence available to the victim state shortly after suffering an offensive cyber operation.¹¹⁰ For example, the victim state might only need to find on the balance of evidence that a particular state is responsible for an offensive cyber operation if deploying countermeasures, such as the violation of a treaty between the victim and aggressor states, but it may need clear-and-convincing evidence to respond with a use of armed force. This proposal falls in line with the second Tallinn Manual’s suggestion that “the greater the underlying breach . . . the greater the confidence ought to be in the evidence relied upon by a State considering a response” since the “robustness of permissible self-help responses grows commensurately with the seriousness of the breach.”¹¹¹ For example, a state should be more confident in its attribution when it responds with armed force to a cyber attack on an air traffic control system that resulted in aircraft accidents and fatalities. The same should be expected if it were to suffer an attack on the underground pump controllers for an underground rail system that resulted in major flooding and destruction of its infrastructure. If a state were to suffer a denial of service attack on the website of a regulatory agency that issues permits for hunting and fishing, however, principles of necessity and proportionality dictate that the victim state would only be permitted to respond with something\n\n¹¹⁰ Professors Christian Payne and Lorraine Finlay have proposed a standard of proof tied to the victim’s response, but they have failed to provide much detail other than suggesting victim states that “pursue peaceful, legal processes” for resolving disputes related to cyber operations should “have the benefit of eschewing stringent attribution tests normally required.” Payne &amp; Finlay, supra note 5, at 567. In such cases, they suggest strict liability for those states that the victim state believes to be the host states for the attack. Id. at 566–67.

After acquiring evidence to prove its attributional claim at a higher standard of proof, such as clear-and-convincing evidence, a state could respond with armed force if it were to conclude that such force would be proportional and necessary to repel the attack or later attacks.¹¹³ This shifting standard of proof does not change the ultimate severity ceiling of the response available to the victim state, which is still tied to the underlying breach and governed by principles of proportionality and necessity; rather, it adapts the severity of the response to the standard of proof that the victim state is able to meet at any given point.¹¹⁴ This would allow victim states to respond—at least in some fashion—more quickly, and thereby more effectively, to offensive cyber operations than if a higher evidentiary threshold were required uniformly among all types of responses. Victim states, of course, could still increase the severity of their responses as needed to force the attacking state back into compliance with its international obligations, so long as the certainty in the attacker’s identity correspondingly increased.\n\nAdmittedly, such a standard might result in more severe and more frequent state responses against less sophisticated actors—who lack the ability to hide the evidence that leads to their identity—than sophisticated actors. But this is no different than any other system that requires evidentiary burdens to be met before responsive measures can be taken: even in domestic criminal\n\n¹¹² See infra note 113.\n\n¹¹³ International Governmental Group of Experts, Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare 61 (Michael N. Schmitt ed., 2013).\n\n¹¹⁴ While outside the scope of this Note, there is no reason why such a standard could not be tied to any use of force, whether it be conventional or cyber. Indeed, there is a colorable argument that it would be wise to apply such a standard beyond the cyber context, particularly given the ad hoc factual evaluation of conventional use of force events and their associated attribution problems.\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202",

Further, and more importantly, the proposed evidentiary framework will create opportunities for states to take measures against actors whose sophistication in hiding their identity would, under a more exacting standard of proof, leave victims without any recourse time and time again.\n\nPart II further explores how evaluations of such evidence could be more publicly accountable by allowing states to submit their claims to a neutral body that would provide an attributional assessment of the offensive cyber operation, including a forensic report and a confidence judgment as to the culprit. It also examines how such a body could contribute to the creation of international norms—and, eventually, customary international law—that integrate this sliding-scale evidentiary framework and which make it clear what standard of proof a state should have to meet before responding with the use of force or countermeasures. In this way, the body could create a platform through which states could better define customary international law, even where attempts to build positive international law have stalled or failed.^[115]^\n\n## D. Frameworks for Assessing State Responsibility for Cyber Operations\n\nIn contrast with standards of proof, principles of state responsibility are far better defined under international law, thanks to the ICJ's jurisprudence and the International Law Commission's (\"ILC\") Articles on State Responsibility. As a result, the second Tallinn Manual provides far more guidance about principles of state responsibility as they relate to cyber operations, beginning with Tallinn Rule 14's threshold^[116]^: \"A State bears international responsibility for a cyber-related act\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202",
    "Lefebvre\nCracking Attribution\n28\n\nthat is attributable to the State and that constitutes a breach of an international legal obligation.”¹¹⁷ Rules 15–18 particularize this requirement by adapting it to common situations, with each rule further attenuating the relation from the responsible state. Rule 15 indicates that states are responsible for cyber operations conducted by their own organs and individual representatives of the state who are authorized to exercise the governmental authority of the state.¹¹⁸ Rule 16 addresses situations in which a state places one of its organs at the disposal of another state. It indicates that cyber operations are attributable to the latter state so long as it is exercising government authority over the former state’s organ.¹¹⁹ Rule 17 deals with state control of non-state actors. It identifies that the state is responsible for those cyber operations committed by non-state actors that it directs, controls, or that the state acknowledges and adopts as its own, reflecting the concept of “effective control” articulated in the Nicaragua case.¹²⁰ Rule 18 deals with a state’s responsibility for the cyber operations of foreign states, concluding that one state bears responsibility for another’s cyber operation when, knowing of the act’s wrongful character, it either coerces, aids or assists, or directs and controls that state in the operation.¹²¹ As a result of the distributed nature of the Internet, the second Tallinn Manual took the view that geography is of little importance into inquiries of state responsibility.¹²² Instead, the inquiry is almost entirely grounded in the instruction received and control exercised by any given state.¹²³\n\n¹¹⁷ Tallinn Manual 2.0, supra note 1, at 84. The language “breach of an international legal obligation” is particularly important, since it does not include activities that are either unregulated by international law, such as cyber espionage and related intelligence gathering, or are expressly permitted, such as suspension of international cyber communication services within its territory.

Despite differences in what evidence is required, the evidentiary standard remains the same for each.¹²⁷ Thus, in order to reach an attribution conclusion, the analysis developed in the previous Section should be applied not just to factual determinations that lead to the identities of individual cyber operators, but to factual determinations that lead to conclusions about state responsibility.\n\n## II.

See Charney, Microsoft Corp., supra note 12, at 11; Jason Healey, et al., Atlantic Council, Confidence-Building Measures in Cyberspace: A Multistakeholder Approach for Stability and Security 10 (2014).\n¹⁴¹ Davis et al., RAND Corp., supra note 51, at 29; see also Efrony, supra note 133 (supporting the idea of excluding states from a global attribution body).\n¹⁴² Admittedly, “global operations” does not mean such operations will be equal among all states. One might argue that states with more sophisticated technology sectors could have more influence over the Consortium than states with less sophisticated technology sectors, since such countries will likely have stronger ties to members of the Consortium. But given the wide network of global interests and partnerships that states with sophisticated technology sectors have, which often tie them to states with smaller technology sectors, it is unlikely that the Consortium could or would privilege states along this line. Consider, for example, Russia’s collaborative interests with Iran, or the United States’ strong relationship with Afghanistan. Given this, the more relevant distinction may be between those states with friends and those without.\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202",

The nature of the organization’s work requires not only a better reputation for neutrality than what could be accomplished with an intergovernmental organization, but an incredibly strong reputation for neutrality and expertise. This would, at a minimum, require geographic diversity from each of the sectors represented and strict transparency in both its governance and evaluation methodologies and procedures.¹⁴³ As RAND puts it, with no international norms to rely upon at present, the Consortium can only derive its legitimacy over time from “the reputation and credibility gained from the technical expertise of its diverse global membership and its commitment to objectivity and transparency in its attribution findings.”¹⁴⁴\n\nTo deliver on the promise of providing more reliable and transparent attributional assessments than what states have offered to date, the Consortium would need to include formalized conditions that trigger its review, standardized processes for evidence collection and assessment, attribution-confidence standards, procedures for notification and publication of results, and standardized procedures to assess the severity and sophistication of offensive operations.¹⁴⁵ Indeed, standardization and transparency are two crucial elements missing from the current diffuse attribution regime. As discussed, because of the lack of clear evidentiary standards, states at present have little incentive to be transparent in their technical analysis.¹⁴⁶ Further, even\n\n¹⁴³ See Davis et al., RAND Corp., supra note 51, at 30.\n¹⁴⁴ Id.\n¹⁴⁵ Davis et al., RAND Corp., supra note 51, at 35.\n¹⁴⁶ See supra Section I.C.\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202",

Because such firms hold significant influence in the industry, they could integrate the standardized practices developed for the Consortium into the investigative procedures that they conduct independently for clients of their business units, pushing the entire industry toward standardization. This is a key benefit of the Consortium, since—given the incredible variety and number of offensive cyber operations carried out—RAND envisions the body having a discretionary docket.¹⁴⁹ For example, the Consortium may choose to take up an attack that destroyed petrochemical refineries, electrical grids, or nuclear reactors but be forced to turn down requests to investigate low-level denial-of-service attacks.¹⁵⁰ After conducting the investigation, the Consortium would provide its forensic report, attribution assessment, and the confidence level\n\n¹⁴⁷ See Davis et al., RAND Corp., supra note 51, at 20; Max Smeets, When Naming Cyber Threat Actors Does More Harm Than Good, Council on Foreign Relations: Blog (Oct. 24, 2016), https://www.cfr.org/blog/when-naming-cyber-threat-actors-does-more-harm-good (“First, if a competitor has already discovered a threat actor, the threat actor shouldn’t be renamed to fit another company’s branding.

While the Consortium would only begin an investigation at the request of the victim,¹⁵² the question remains, at least in some cases, as to which victim would have the proper standing to file a request with the Consortium.¹⁵³ For example, if an electrical utility suffers an attack on its infrastructure, does the state retain exclusive rights to trigger the investigation and publicize the results or should the utility company have the ability to file an investigation request? RAND suggests leaving such decisions up to the discretion of the Consortium.¹⁵⁴ But granting a private entity standing to bring an investigation request makes little sense, particularly given the consequences for the victim state if the operation were publicized and a state or non-state actor were accused. At the time of the request’s filing, there may be little clue as to the identity of the attacker. The risks of giving a private entity the right to publicize attacks and accuse another state with the Consortium’s platform and credibility behind its claim could cause significant difficulties for states in planning and conducting their international relations.¹⁵⁵ While private entities may be hesitant to report attacks to their host states—particularly if they might be liable in some way for the intrusion—these concerns make it more prudent to favor giving states exclusive standing to bring the claim and to publicize the results.\n\n¹⁵¹ Id. at 39.\n¹⁵² Id.\n¹⁵³ Id. at 36.\n¹⁵⁴ Id.\n¹⁵⁵ This concern resembles those that some have been expressed about claims made under the Alien Tort Statute and their potential to interfere with the foreign affairs of the United States.

    "Lefebvre\nCracking Attribution\n36\n\nMore complex issues arise when deciding which of multiple states should have standing to bring a claim. Consider, for example, a scenario in which an actor conducts an offensive cyber operation against a company incorporated in the United States with its principal place of business in the United States. Suppose, however, that the company also has offices in Beijing and the offensive cyber operation was conducted exclusively against the company’s servers in Beijing, resulting in significant physical destruction of company property and the death of one or more U.S. nationals. On one hand, one might think that the United States is the victim state, since a kinetic attack was conducted against its nationals and their property.¹⁵⁶ However, if the culprit is a foreign state, China would have suffered an armed attack and a violation of its territorial integrity.¹⁵⁷ But depending on the circumstances surrounding the attack, there might even be reasonable suspicion that China itself is the culprit. Which state should be able to bring the episode to the Consortium? The answer, at least on these facts, seems to be that both states should have standing to bring the investigation request. But even if both parties have standing, should both enjoy the right to publicize the result? If the United States wanted to publicize the result, but China did not, should China retain a veto over the United States’ decision to publicize? The answer to that question is unclear, but it demonstrates that standing to bring an investigation request may not necessarily track with the right to publicize the result. It would seem prudent, despite the international relations costs, for the Consortium to tie standing with the exclusive right to publicize the results: divvying\n\n¹⁵⁶ Even if the United States did not suffer a use of force or armed attack against its territorial integrity or political independence in this scenario, it was a victim of an Article 2(4) violation if one takes a somewhat broader conception of the provision. One state killing the nationals of another state would, at the very least, be activity “inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations.” U.N. Charter art. 2(4). Customary international law’s doctrine permitting the protection of nationals abroad seems to reflect that this is a sensible construction as does the principle of passive personality. See Restatement (Third) of the Foreign Relations Law of the U.S., § 402 cmt. g (Am. Law. Inst. 1987) (passive personality principle); Andrew W.R.

Regardless, the Consortium’s discretion will become critical in its standing determinations, since its legitimacy and neutrality could be at risk depending on how it chooses to decide these issues.\n\nAt least in what might be expected in the typical case, where it is clear which state has both standing to bring the request and the right to publicize results, the Consortium’s work functions similarly to a pretrial hearing in the United States, where the Consortium acts as both factfinder and judge. While this is yet another area that the RAND proposal does not discuss with much depth, it would be sensible for the Consortium to provide the accused state with an advance copy of the Consortium’s report and an opportunity to rebut its conclusion and aspects of forensic report. This stage of the investigation could provide victim states with an opportunity to supplement the technical report from the Consortium’s forensic investigation with evidence gained through the victim state’s intelligence capabilities, such as from SIGINT and HUMINT, perhaps presenting such information to the Consortium in camera. To the extent a victim state is unwilling to share its intelligence with the Consortium, the only cost would be a lower confidence level in the attribution assessment than the Consortium would otherwise be able to provide. Alternatively, the Consortium might be able to release its forensic report and confidence assessment of the identity of the individual operators but provide a no-confidence or low-confidence assessment of state responsibility. Such a report would, at the very least, be valuable if the victim state chose to indict the operators under its domestic criminal law.¹⁵⁸\n\n¹⁵⁸ See, e.g., Press Release, U.S. Dep’t of Justice, North Korean Regime-Backed Programmer Charged with Conspiracy to Conduct Multiple Cyber Attacks and Intrusions (Sept. 6, 2018), https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/north-korean-regime-backed-programmer-charged-conspiracy-conduct-multiple-cyber-attacks-and.

Further, in the investigations it would accept, its technical capabilities could still help to fill the evidentiary gap that states face in justifying countermeasures or self-defense, especially where the victim state’s technical capabilities are lacking.\n\nTo the extent that states are able to point to an independent body’s declassified cyber forensic investigation, a state’s justification for countermeasures would be built on firmer factual ground than if it only had its classified intelligence to rely upon. With a reduced ability to hide behind a claim of pretextual or false accusation, states might exercise more caution in conducting offensive cyber operations or might restrict themselves to low-level uses of force so as not to draw attention of the Consortium.¹⁵⁹ This is true whether or not key players in the international community choose to submit a case to the Consortium. One may expect that the United States, China, Israel, or Russia may at first feel more comfortable relying upon the technical sophistication of their own intelligence communities to reliably identify culprits and might reject opening up the process to an independent body. But unlike with the political backing needed in a multilateral treaty, the Consortium could still provide much-needed technical assistance to less sophisticated middle-power and developing states that are targets of cyber attacks and exploitations, without the\n\nConducting Coordinated Campaign of Cyber Attacks Against U.S. Financial Sector (March 24, 2016), https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/seven-iranians-working-islamic-revolutionary-guard-corps-affiliated-entities-charged; Press Release, U.S. Dep’t Justice, U.S. Charges Five Chinese Military Hackers for Cyber Espionage Against U.S. Corporations and a Labor Organization for Commercial Advantage, (May 19, 2014), https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/us-charges-five-chinese-military-hackers-cyber-espionage-against-us-corporations-and-labor.\n\n¹⁵⁹ At least part of the blame for the difficulties of deterring offensive cyber operations lies with the challenges in reliably attributing the operations to the correct culprit.

Rather than have states act as their own judges of how much proof is necessary to respond to an attack,¹⁶² states might feel they are obligated to justify their actions in the face of a quantifiable confidence metric.\n\nStates might also choose to reference such assessments in their domestic prosecutions of the accused individuals.

Challenges Ahead\n\nDespite the promise an independent non-governmental attribution body like the Consortium holds for building international norms, challenges remain for the Consortium’s effective execution. If independence is a key feature, from what sources could it responsibly derive funding? How will such a body prioritize its investigations and how will it deliver results quickly enough to meet the need for timely response that victim states will face? Further, without traditional sources of intelligence at hand, how will such a body meet the need to connect an operator’s activity with state direction and control in the case of state-sponsored attacks?\n\nRAND suggests initial funding from philanthropic sources and the inclusion of a charter mandate to seek funding from the United Nations at a later point.¹⁶⁶ RAND also points to the possibility of funding from cybersecurity and information technology companies that operate and defend much of the infrastructure upon which attacks are launched.¹⁶⁷ This might not be so far-fetched: if the Consortium were able to build a strong reputation in the international community,\n\n¹⁶⁴ Deeks, supra note 163.\n¹⁶⁵ See supra note 115.\n¹⁶⁶ Davis et al., RAND Corp., supra note 51, at 44.\n¹⁶⁷ Id. at 45.\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202",

If any attribution body were to accept fees for its services to offset its costs, its revenue streams would need to be diversified enough to prevent reliance on fees from any particular state, region, or global bloc.\n\nDeveloping prioritization policies may best be left to the discretion of the Consortium, given the variety of effects cyber attacks produce and the difficulty in organizing attacks by their severity. For example, the Consortium might be forced to choose between investigating a cyber attack that resulted in an explosion that killed tens of people or a ransomware attack that paralyzed the state’s ability to provide key services and cost its citizens and businesses hundreds of millions of dollars and maybe, indirectly, loss of life.¹⁶⁹ In this case, one might suggest investigating the former first, since the victim state in that case would have suffered an armed attack under the effects test¹⁷⁰ and would have the right to respond in self-defense, if such measures were necessary to prevent future attacks.¹⁷¹ However, one can imagine murkier cases where the severity might be tied to the degree of harm suffered by the victim.

If a state continues to suffer armed attacks or uses of force, the victim might need to respond with self-defense measures under Article 51 or enact countermeasures in order to bring the culprit back into compliance with its international obligations. In such a situation, the Consortium might be able to release preliminary findings at a lower confidence level. Acting on any such findings could operate under a “buyer beware” framework, a concept that would tie nicely with the sliding-scale evidentiary framework proposed in Section I.C.¹⁷² Over time, international norms—and perhaps, eventually, customary international law—could be built around the level of confidence expected from attributional assessments before a state could pursue countermeasures, invoke pleas of necessity, or undertake acts of self-defense. The Consortium’s findings would make the adoption of this sliding-scale evidentiary framework more easily possible, since the findings would provide a quantifiable, standardized, and easily referenced confidence level for the international community to debate. Over time, this transparency could help develop international law’s standards of proof by providing more transparent examples of state practice, leading to easier identification of the *opinio juris* needed to locate customary international law. For example, one might find, after mapping the Consortium’s confidence levels of its attribution assessments to the corresponding state responses, that states are only willing to enact countermeasures on confidence levels of fifty percent or higher and self-defense measures on confidence levels of seventy-five percent or higher.\n\n¹⁷² See supra note 109–111 and accompanying text.\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202",

In 2013, Mandiant felt confident enough to attach blame to a Chinese military unit for numerous attacks on U.S. corporations, organizations, and government agencies.¹⁷⁴ And FireEye has compiled enough evidence to confidently connect a threat it refers to as “APT37,” or “Reaper,” with the North Korean state.¹⁷⁵ While this is an area where traditional intelligence capabilities will still be critical to attribution investigations, the Consortium’s work can help bolster claims of state responsibility made by states based on classified evidence, even if the Consortium’s findings are less conclusive than evidence the victim state might possess.\n\nPerhaps the most significant challenge facing the Consortium is the ostensibly low likelihood that competing tech companies would come together to participate in the organization.

    "Lefebvre\nCracking Attribution\n45\n\n# CONCLUSION\n\nChallenges dot the road ahead for progress on international norms in cyberspace. While multilateral treaties and international cooperation might be the preferred avenue to overcome them, current trends provide little hope for the success of such options. Despite this, the development of customary international law provides an opportunity to push forward in regulating state behavior surrounding cyberspace. This Note demonstrates how an attributional body like the Consortium stands to provide substantial benefit to the development of these norms by providing states with a transparent and independent mechanism upon which to build evidentiary standards, such as the sliding-scale evidentiary framework, to undergird countermeasures and acts of self-defense. In this way, the international community can make more consistent judgments about state action in response to offensive cyber operations. While this may provide less flexibility for states to act in the face of such operations than what is nearly guaranteed through today's system of opaque unilateral evidentiary assessments, such restrictions on state behavior would benefit the international community at large by increasing global stability. Further, adopting this Note's version of a sliding-scale approach to the standard of proof—one where the standard fluctuates based on the response a victim wishes to undertake—should accommodate the flexibility states need when attempting to respond to quickly to a cyber attack.\n\nBy offering both victim states and the accused the opportunity to obtain an independent, sophisticated, and quantifiable attributional assessment, a body like the Consortium could help alleviate the deterrence difficulties inherent in a low-confidence attribution landscape and reduce the risk that states escalate or begin conflicts with parties that have no relation to the conflict. Questions persist regarding sources of funding for the Consortium, its operational efficiency in light of the need for quick responses to severe offensive operations, and the remaining difficulty\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202",

States can still do their part to gradually advance international norms by responsibly conducting their own cyber practices and related behavior in an effort to shape customary international law. An independent non-governmental attributional body like the Consortium provides a powerful launchpad for them to do just that.\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3300202"
