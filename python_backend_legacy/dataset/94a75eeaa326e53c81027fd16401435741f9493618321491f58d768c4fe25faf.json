Many look to state practice, and conclude that acts of espionage must surely be legal because so many states spy on one another.¹ Others say that sending spies in to the territory of another state breaches the norm of territorial and sovereign integrity, and therefore acts of espionage should rightly be considered illegal pursuant to the relevant legal rules.² The difficulty in assessing legality is amplified when analyzing cyber intrusions, because they do not offend the principle of territorial integrity in the same way that sending an actual state agent to gather human intelligence (colloquially referred to as “HUMINT”) would. This paper is an attempt to address these legal ambiguities.\n\nHowever, because there is no public multilateral treaty that addresses acts of cyber espionage, recourse must be made to the customary rules to determine the position of espionage under international law. At its most basic level, customary law is comprised of the rules that emerge as a matter of past practice amongst nation states, and which come to govern future relations between them. The Statute of the International Court of Justice defines customary law as “evidence of a general practice accepted as law.” This has been interpreted to mean that for a customary norm of conduct to crystallize into a binding rule – gaining formal status under international law – two constituent criteria must be met. First, there must be widespread and consistent state practice. Second, the activity in question, or the abstinence of states from engaging in a particular activity, must be done out of a sense of legal compulsion. This second element, called *opinio juris*, is used to differentiate state actions that are legally obliged from those undertaken for some other purpose (like self-interest or comity).\n\nThe starting point for the application of international rules is the often cited *Lotus* principle, which asserts that a sovereign state may undertake any action they wish, as long as that action is not explicitly prohibited.³ The relevant question then becomes: Is there an explicit prohibition on acts of cyber espionage? The research goal of this paper is to answer that question, and in answering this question the paper will make three arguments.\n\nFirst, that despite the fact that states routinely spy on each other, there is no evidence to support the proposition that state actors view cyber espionage as something that is legal under customary\n\n¹ Geoffrey B.

In this regard, while instances of cyber espionage may not offend the territorial integrity of the target state like human spying would, a sound legal conclusion can be drawn that certain intrusions will offend the principle of non-interference under international law. And, if cyber intrusions offend the principle of non-interference, they are correctly considered to be illegal pursuant to the relevant customary rules.\n\nSecond, the forces that influence the behavior of both state and non-state actors in relation to cyber espionage are much more complicated than a simple determination of legality. Cyber espionage may be illegal, but this vague notion of illegality pursuant to an even vaguer general rule of customary law acts as an extremely poor constraint on state behaviour. Poorly constrained, it is no surprise that states have engaged in a massive campaign of political, economic and military cyber espionage activities. However, many states view the current situation characterized by widespread (and largely unchecked) acts of cyber espionage as unsustainable. It is the explosion in the number of targets created by the Internet that has led the global community in to a process of what international relations scholars call ‘regime’ building, or what international lawyers call the ‘transnational legal process’. Simply put, the existing rules (both hard and soft) that govern behavior are evolving, and new rules are – or at the very least will be – emerging.\n\nThird, contemporary regime building efforts driven largely by the United States seem poised to build a bifurcated legal regime separating out economic espionage (aimed at private sector interests) from other more traditional forms (aimed largely at states). The most recent evidence of this came during high-level talks between the United States and China, when it became clear that the agenda of the United States was to establish restrictive prohibitions on economically oriented acts of cyber espionage alongside a more permissive regime for traditional security related espionage. After the first day of talks, an American official said in relation to the theft of intellectual property, “we don’t do it, and we don’t think any country should do it.”⁴ For its part, China does not see a comparable distinction between economic and military security. As an example, the China Daily – a government oriented publication – wrote that “by dividing cyberespionage into ‘bad’ and ‘good’ activities, Washington is trying to dictate the rules for global cyberdomain, which is a public space.”⁵ Thus, it seems clear that the normative ground is shifting. But given the divergent views among two of the main actors, it remains unclear how fast and how far these normative changes will go to actually curbing unwanted state behavior in cyber space.\n\nIn order to make these arguments, this paper will proceed as follows. Part I will set out the precise content of the norm of non-interference under international law. Part II will examine state practice and opinio juris in relation to cyber espionage through the lens of the 2010 clandestine entry into Google’s servers – termed operation Aurora – arguing that there is no opinio juris to support state practice and that, even when caught, states tend to deny responsibility for acts of cyber espionage. Part III examines the emerging trend toward a more robust regime, which seeks to place greater constraints on the commission of acts of cyber\n\n⁴ David E.

Finally, Part IV concludes with some recommendations regarding the potential course of evolution in this dynamic area of law.\n\n## PART I - THE NORM OF NON-INTERFERENCE UNDER INTERNATIONAL LAW AND CYBER ESPIONAGE\n\nAt its most basic level, the principle of non-interference provides, that “[n]o state has the right to intervene in the internal or external affairs of another.”⁶ This general statement of principle seems to elude precise quantification and the jurisprudence is largely unhelpful in determining with any level of specificity the content of the prohibition on foreign interference. The clearest articulation of the norm from the International Court of Justice is that the principle forbids intervention that has a “bearing on matters in which each State is permitted, by the principle of State sovereignty, to decide freely.”⁷ The utility of this observation is limited by the fact that the modern regulatory state is free to decide almost anything within its territory, and because there is a serious gap between what a broad view of the norm of non-interference would require and what states actually do in their conduct toward one another.⁸ For that reason, determining the content of the norm with precision will require a case-by-case analysis to determine whether the specific conduct in question - in this case cyber espionage - falls within the scope of the prohibition.\n\nThere have been two broadly supported United Nations General Assembly Resolutions that have some bearing on the scope of the principle. The first is the 1965 the Declaration on the Inadmissibility of Intervention in the Domestic Affairs of States and the Protection of their Independence and Sovereignty (“Declaration on Intervention”).⁹ The second is the 1970 Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States in Accordance with the Charter of the United Nations (“Friendly Relations Declaration”).¹⁰ These two documents are strikingly similar, with only modest differences. The relevant operative paragraph of the Friendly Relations Declaration is slightly more robust, stating:\n\nNo State or group of States has the right to intervene, directly or indirectly, for any reason whatever, in the internal or external affairs of any other State. Consequently, armed intervention and all other forms of interference or attempted threats against the personality of the State or against its political, economic and cultural elements, are in violation of international law.¹¹\n\nThus, within the Friendly Relations Declaration, which is widely regarded to reflect customary\n\nElectronic copy available at: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2809828\n\n6 Montevideo Convention on the Rights and Duties of States, Dec. 26, 1933, 49 Stat. 3097, TS No. 881, 165 LNTS 19, Art. 8.\n\n7 Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua (Nicar. v.

However, the International Court of Justice narrowed this broad articulation in the Nicaragua decision, noting that:\n\nA prohibited intervention must accordingly be one bearing on matters in which each State is permitted, by the principle of State sovereignty, to decide freely. One of these is the choice of a political, economic, social and cultural system, and the formulation of foreign policy. Intervention is wrongful when it uses methods of coercion in regard to such choices, which must remain free ones.¹³\n\nThe problem is that the Court does not go on to define with any level of specificity what the content of the prohibition on interference actually is. The Court indicates that in order to be prohibited under international law an intervention must be one bearing on matters that each State is permitted, by the principle of State sovereignty, to decide freely. Unfortunately, rather than clarifying this position, the Court – curiously – goes on to consider whether there is any customary international law allowing intervention. Thus, the actual content of the norm of non-interference is left ill-defined and extremely vague.\n\nThe Nicaragua decision is further limited by the fact that it is decided at that outset that the \"Court will define only those aspects of the principle which appear to be relevant to the resolution of the dispute.\"¹⁴ In this respect this case is lacking because, in many ways, the discussion of non-interference/non-intervention is subsumed within the larger discussion of the prohibition on the use of force that is the immediate subject matter of the decision. Therefore, the decision really provides only a partial discussion of the principle of non-interference. The Court explicitly chooses to discuss only those aspects of the principle relevant to the case before it. By definition then, the principle of non-interference goes beyond the narrow articulation presented by the Court. Consequently, states and legal scholars alike were left with only a partial explanation of the rule and with an unfinished legal test to determine which acts will actually offend the rule against foreign interference. What if any relevance does this limited test have for determining if a particular act of cyber espionage will offend the principle against non-interference? The simple answer is not much.\n\nPursuant to the test for interference posited in the Nicaragua case, in order to fall within the definition of prohibited intervention, the act in question must be intended to force or coerce a change of policy within the victim state. This formulation is not without support in the literature. Russell Buchan recently put forward a rote articulation of this test, in relation to cyber interference. Buchan argues:\n\nAll in all, in order to establish a violation of the non-intervention principle two questions must be addressed. First, is the intervention intended to force the victim State into a change of policy? [...] Secondly, if the intention to impose coercion is present, it must then be asked whether the application of coercion bears upon matters\n\n¹² Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua (Nicar. v.

As an example, in February of 2011 the Internet security firm, McAfee, uncovered a major network infiltration using IP addresses located in China. The intrusion, labeled “Night Dragon”, targeted Western oil and energy companies and “[t]he goal of the intrusions was to obtain information on sensitive competitive proprietary operations and on financing of oil and gas field bids and operations.”¹⁷ In this case, valuable proprietary information was stolen and a significant benefit would have accrued to the relevant Chinese agencies or firms. However, because the objective was to obtain sensitive information and to use it against Chinese competitors, according to the circumspect test of the International Court of Justice in Nicaragua or the analysis put forward by Buchan, this would not qualify as an unlawful intervention or interference. This is because the breach was not intended to change a policy within the victim state.\n\nThis notion is deeply problematic given that the gravamen of the offence of unlawful interference is intervening in to the sphere over which the target state has authority. States – acting in their capacity as a sovereign – have the ability to regulate telecommunications, Internet service providers, intellectual property rights, and criminal sanctions related to data breaches. The exercise of these rights has nothing to do with the intent of the offending party. Rather, the right itself flows from state sovereignty. It is the intervention within the affairs of a sovereign state that is offensive, regardless of the intent of the intervening party.\n\nHowever, given the limits of the applicable jurisprudence, all that can really be said about the status of the law is that it remains unclear and ill-suited to address clandestine cyber intrusions. The law is unclear because there is no authoritative decision that unequivocally demarcates the boundaries of an independent right of non-interference. The law is ill-suited to address cyber intrusions, because if a requisite element of the test of non-interference is the requirement to influence policy in the target state, then intrusions that are motivated by some other desire (i.e. economics) and which are meant to remain covert will rarely – if ever – meet this threshold. Employing a purposive (intent based) analysis to determine whether or not a covert cyber entry will offend the principle of non-interference is inappropriate because it sets up an impossible test – how can one ever know what the intention is behind a clandestine network entry?\n\n¹⁵ Russell Buchan, *Cyber Attacks: Unlawful Uses of Force or Prohibited Interventions?* 2 J. OF CONFLICT &amp; SEC. L. 211, 224-225.\n\n¹⁶ These would likely be governed under Article 2(4) of the United Nations Charter as a use of force. See Matthew C. Waxman, *Cyber-Attacks and the Use of Force: Back to the Future of Article 2(4)*, 36 YALE J.

In this regard, Mary Ellen O'Connell writes:\n\nJust because a cyber-attack or cyber espionage do not amount to an armed attack does not mean that international law has no law against such wrongs. Interference with a State's economic sphere, air space, maritime space or territorial space, even if not prohibited by treaty is prohibited under the general principle of non-intervention. This is apparent in a number of treaties, UN resolutions and ICJ decisions that condemn coercion, interference or intervention that falls short of the use of force.¹⁸\n\nEven with this limited scholarly support, the actual content of the norm against cyber interference remains amorphous. Surely the norm would not encompass every mild cyber incident, but it must still protect the customary norm that “every sovereign state [has a right] to conduct its affairs without outside interference.”¹⁹ By definition then, determining which cyber intrusions offend the principle of non-interference and which do not will be an exercise in legal line drawing. Suppose for example that State A plans to infiltrate a functioning nuclear power plant in State B. The purpose is to force B to change a foreign policy position. When B decides not to change its position, A activates previously placed nefarious code, or “logic bomb”,²⁰ and causes a meltdown. This would offend both the prohibition on the use of force and easily offend the principle of non-interference. However, suppose B infiltrates the network of the company that makes the reactor to steal industrial designs, recognizing a major cost savings in the establishment of a domestic nuclear power industry. Would this offend the principle of non-interference? What if B just looks at the designs but does not use them for any purpose?\n\nThese examples demonstrate a clear need to rearticulate the test for prohibited interference in relation to cyber intrusions, moving away from a test that is based on the intent of the offending party to one based on the potential effect of the intrusion. The principle of non-interference is often said to be a corollary of the principle of state sovereignty.²¹ A corollary is something which is a “proposition that follows from a proven proposition with little or no additional proof; something that naturally flows.”²² In this way, the content of the norm of non-interference should naturally follow the contours of the principle of state sovereignty.

This is a permissible interpretation of the rule, because as noted above, the International Court of Justice’s previous ruling on the issue dealt with only a narrow application of the norm and only to the extent that was necessary to deal with matters immediately before it in the Nicaragua case.\n\nIf one adopts this rearticulated effects based test, then covert entry into networks accompanied by the stealing of intellectual property, which undermines confidence in the Internet and telecommunications generally,²³ threatens national security,²⁴ or undermines the financial position or competiveness of domestic companies²⁵ – and the corresponding revenue base of their governments – could potentially offend the principle of non-interference. This would necessarily be subject to the doctrine of de minimis non curat lex, or the idea that the law does not concern itself with trifles. Thus, in order to offend the principle, there should be some significant effect attached to the cyber intrusion. If, these criteria are met, then a reasonable reading of the principle of non-interference as articulated in Declaration on Intervention and the Friendly Relations Declaration, which are considered to be customary law, would recognize these events as prohibited.\n\nThe main anticipated critique to the conception of a norm of non-interference that that would prohibit these forms of cyber intrusions is that state practice diverges markedly from it. Universally, articles on the law of espionage rely on the fact that many states engage in espionage as a justification for its legality. The thrust of the response is that secret state practice is legally irrelevant. The fact that states hide their behavior reinforces the existence of a prohibition, but more importantly, there is strong authority for the proposition that secret state practice is a deficient and unsatisfactory marker in the establishment of a legal rule, or change in its content.²⁶ According to the International Law Association’s Committee on Formation of Customary (General) International Law, a “secret physical act (e.g. secretly “bugging” diplomatic premises) is probably not an example of the objective element. And if the act is discovered, it probably does not count as State practice unless the State tries to assert that its conduct was legally justified.”²⁷ The very notion of a rule of law presupposes that the rule be public.

Evaluating the practice of states in relation to espionage committed via the Internet is more difficult still, because not only are the activities clandestine, but there are significant challenges with both technical and legal attribution, and even when breaches are uncovered, in many cases the victims are corporations – not states – and often times they do not report the breaches to their own government.²⁹\n\nTherefore, employing case study methodology has distinct advantages over generalizations regarding state practice in this area. However, owing to the furtive character of espionage, selecting an appropriate case for study presents its own challenges. The surreptitious infiltration into the Google network discovered in 2010, termed Operation Aurora, was selected for study not only because of its high level of publicity, but also because it provoked a rare public response from the two major governments involved, the United States and China.\n\nCertainly, there are disadvantages to employing case study methodology as well. More particularly, employing a single case study fails to account for the fact that many governments routinely engage in acts of economic espionage aimed squarely at private actors within competitor states.³⁰ It is also requires generalization from one particular case, involving two state actors, to the wider groups of states. This has significant drawbacks because states do not behave in a uniform fashion, they are not motivated or constrained by the same things, and may take a differing view of a particular act. It is also impossible to ever truly know what is motivating a state to undertake a particular course of action. The fact is that generalizing from one observation is a poor mechanism for understanding the motivations of state behavior in a wider context.

The rare public glimpse into the otherwise murky world of international espionage provides valuable evidence for the evaluation of both state practice and opinio juris regarding these actions.\n\nWhen evaluating the significance of state practice in relation to customary legal rules and espionage, it is a mistake simply to evaluate the conduct of the state that has engaged in the offensive operations. Rather, when operations are uncovered, the response of the offended government is just as, if not more important. Thus, the Google infiltration provides an uncommon example, where a major corporation publicly disclosed the infiltration first, forcing the governments of both states to respond. For that reason, this section will evaluate not only the conduct attributed to the Chinese government in relation to the infiltration of Google and Operation Aurora, but also the response of the United States Government.\n\n## 1. The Aurora Exploit\n\nOn January 12, 2010, David Drummond, Senior Vice-President and Chief Legal Officer of Google publicly disclosed that his company had fallen victim to a major network infiltration. Drummond indicated on the company's official blog, that Google had “detected a highly sophisticated and targeted attack on our corporate infrastructure originating from China that resulted in the theft of intellectual property from Google.”³¹ During their internal investigations into the infiltration, the company determined that at least twenty other large companies in the Internet, finance, technology, media and chemical sectors were also targeted. They also uncovered evidence to suggest that “a primary goal of the attackers was accessing the Gmail accounts of Chinese human rights activists.”³²\n\nAccording to subsequent investigations undertaken by the Internet security firm, McAfee, Operation Aurora initially targeted an individual user within Google. This individual would then receive a link in either an email or through an instant message that purported to be from a trusted source. Once the targeted user clicked on the link at their computer, they would be directed to a website hosted on servers in Taiwan that contained a malicious JavaScript payload.³³ Once at the nefarious website, the Internet browser program being used to view the website automatically downloaded and executed the malicious program code, which included a zero-day Internet Explorer exploit.³⁴ The exploit then executed the malicious payload, which set up a backdoor³⁵ and the networked computer of the unsuspecting user was then remotely connected to command\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809828\n\n³¹ David Drummond, *A new approach to China*, GOOGLE: OFFICIAL BLOG (Jan. 12, 2010) http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/01/new-approach-to-china.html\n\n³² David Drummond, *A new approach to China*, GOOGLE: OFFICIAL BLOG (Jan. 12, 2010) http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/01/new-approach-to-china.html\n\n³³ In basic terms, JavaScript is computer-coding language employed in numerous popular applications including websites and PDFs.\n\n³⁴ A zero-day exploit is the term of art among software developers and hackers that refers to a previously unknown vulnerability in a computer application. The use of the term zero-day, is meant to connote that the first attack on the software takes place on “day zero” of vulnerability awareness on the part of the software developer. It also means that the software developers have had zero days to develop a software “patch” that addresses the vulnerability in question.\n\n³⁵ When attempting to remotely access a computer there is typically an authentication process, which ensures that the party seeking access is entitled to that access. By placing a “back door” on the system, the party seeking access can bypass the normal process of authentication and can have virtually unfettered access to the target system.",

They targeted sources of intellectual property, including software configuration management (SCM) systems accessible by the compromised system.”³⁶\n\nThe methods employed during the exploit seem clear. However, actually attributing that covert network exploitation back to the Chinese Government is a different story. In this respect, one report prepared for the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission by Northrop Grumman Corp stated that:\n\nThe publicly disclosed evidence linking Chinese state sponsorship to the Google intrusion is compelling but still largely circumstantial. Analysis of the malware by third party specialists identified only a small component of the overall code that clearly had a Chinese pedigree; the information targeted was both Google source code and email accounts reportedly of Chinese human rights activists, suggesting a political as well as economic motivation. The IP addresses for the C2 nodes discovered during the forensic investigation were attributed to a Chinese college that has been linked in the past to alleged state sponsored network exploitation activity.³⁷\n\nHowever, in a leaked classified cable from the United States Embassy in Beijing, the United States government was informed that “[a] well-placed contact claims that the Chinese government coordinated the recent intrusions of Google systems. According to our contact, the closely held operations were directed at the Politburo Standing Committee level.”³⁸ While according to the same cable, “Another contact claimed a top PRC leader was actively working with Google competitor Baidu against Google.”³⁹ In the world of intelligence gathering, there are few certainties; but this cable is close. Although undated, it seems clear that the United States Government was advised shortly after Operation Aurora, and in no uncertain terms, that the infiltration was directed at the Politburo Standing Committee level. The Politburo Standing Committee consists of the top leadership of the Communist Party of China and is the most powerful decision-making body of the Chinese Government.\n\n## 2. The Response of the United States Government\n\nThe response of the United States Government was confusing and watered down. It was confusing because it did not reflect the reality of what the United States Government knew had taken place. It was watered down, because the response morphed over time, from what looked like a strong protest, to a situation where the State Department would not even use the word *demarche*⁴⁰ to classify their response toward the Chinese Government.\n\n³⁶ MCAFEE LABS AND MCAFEE FOUNDSTONE PROFESSIONAL SERVICES, PROTECTING YOUR CRITICAL ASSETS: LESSONS LEARNED FROM “OPERATION AURORA”, available at http://www.mcafee.com/us/resources/white-papers/wp-protecting-critical-assets.pdf.\n\n³⁷ BRYAN KREKEL, PATTON ADAMS &amp; GEORGE BAKOS, OCCUPYING THE INFORMATION HIGH GROUND: CHINESE CAPABILITIES FOR COMPUTER NETWORK OPERATIONS AND CYBER ESPIONAGE 99, Prepared for the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission by Northrop Grumman Corp.

We look to the Chinese government for an explanation.”41 Then, merely one day later, Assistant Secretary of State, Phillip Crowley, in response to a question on the Google infiltration stated that: “I wouldn’t say that this is necessarily different than the range of issues that we continue to work on with China.”42 Thus, the official response morphed in less than 24 hours, from one of serious concern regarding the covert infiltration of Google, to one in which this issue was no different, or more important, then the other issues involved in the bilateral relations between the two states.\n\nThe tone changed again the following day. During the January 14, 2010, press briefing Assistant Secretary of State Crowley stated that “this is – it’s a serious issue on a number of levels. As we have talked about, there are business standards and expectations, international norms that you expect your business partners to live up to. And we have had multiple conversations with China about activity both in this area and more broadly.”43 He then went on to state that: “We [the United States Government] have raised this issue today in saying that we have serious concerns about this and its ramifications.”44\n\nThen on January 15, 2010, the United States Government decided to issue a diplomatic demarche. During the press briefing, Assistant Secretary of State Crowley stated that: “We will be issuing a formal demarche to the Chinese Government in Beijing on this issue in the coming days, probably early next week. [It] will express our concern for this incident and request information from China as to an explanation of how it happened and what they plan to do about it.”45 Notwithstanding this unambiguous statement regarding the issuance of a demarche, it is important to note that a demarche is simply formal diplomatic representation of a government’s official position. They can be used as a mechanism to protest or object to actions by a foreign government, but do not necessarily imply the illegality of those actions. Certainly a government may use a demarche to register its position that a certain act undertaken by a foreign government contravened international law, but this will depend entirely on the wording of the document.\n\nStill, there was a significant softening of this position on January 19, 2010. On that day during the press briefing, Assistant Secretary of State Kurt M. Campbell was asked “whether that\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809828",

The response was terse: \"Kurt [Assistant Secretary of State Campbell] made clear that he had – he said what he said. I'm not going to go further.\"49\n\nOn January 21, 2010, Secretary of State Clinton spoke on Internet freedom, and during those remarks, she commented that the \"recent situation involving Google has attracted a great deal of interest. And we look to the Chinese authorities to conduct a thorough review of the cyber intrusions that led Google to make its announcement. And we also look for that investigation and its results to be transparent.\"50 The Secretary made no mention of a demarche or other formal rebuke.\n\nThen on January 22, 2010 the Washington Post reported that a demarche had already been issued, \"according to a State Department official\".51 However, any ambiguity regarding the issuance of the demarche was removed on January 22, 2010, when Assistant Secretary of State Crowley was pointedly asked \"Did you or did you not issue a demarche?\", his response: \"No. Not yet.\"52 Then on February 19, 2010, Crowley was questioned again about the United States formal diplomatic response to the covert infiltration of Google's network. The question: \"I was just wondering - going back to that Goggle [sic] case, there was the discussion that the U.S. is trying to lodge a formal complaint - a demarche on Goggle [sic]. I'm wondering if that has happened or hasn't, and if not, why not?\" The response:\n\nMR. CROWLEY: Well, I think the – we have had multiple conversations with Chinese officials on this issue, and that included a direct conversation between Secretary Clinton and Foreign Minister Yang in London late last month. So I think we have satisfied ourselves that the Chinese understand the importance with which we view this issue. We have called on the Chinese to conduct a thorough review of cyber intrusions.

CROWLEY: Well, I mean, if – a demarche can be a written statement. It can be a verbal statement. The Secretary directly engaged Foreign Minister Yang on this issue. So if you want to call that a demarche – I think we have done what we set out to do, which is to directly express our concerns at high levels about this activity and to encourage China to investigate it thoroughly.53\n\nIt seems plain that the position of the United States Government morphs over time. The position fluctuates from a issuing a formal demarche to the Chinese Government in Beijing, which expressed serious concern, to a position where the State Department was unwilling to refer to their actions in those terms, referring instead to “high level talks” and “engagement”. The final softening of the United States’ response came several months after the initial announcement by Google.\n\nOn March 19, 2010 Secretary of State Clinton was asked: “What has the Chinese Government told you about their investigation? What kind of pressure are you putting on the Chinese Government?”. The response from the Secretary of State was: “Well, specifically, with respect to Google, this is really between Google and China.”54 There was no indication that there was any formal response from the Chinese government related to an investigation or any hint that the Chinese Government had shared a plan to interdict these types of infiltrations.\n\nFor its part, the United States Congress had a less equivocal response. Senate Resolution 405 was introduced on February 2, 2010. It stated that the Senate: “Condemns the cyber attacks allegedly launched from China against Google and other companies and calls on the government of China to review such cyber intrusions.”55 The Resolution was co-sponsored by senior senators from both parties including Senators McCain, Lieberman, Specter and Feingold. It was considered, and agreed to without amendment and with a preamble by Unanimous Consent.56 The Preamble states, “this attack was one in a series of attempts to exploit security flaws and illegally access computer networks of individuals and institutions through the clandestine installation of phishing and malware technology.”57 Senator Kaufman rose two days later, and said on the Senate Floor, that “[w]ith the passage of this resolution, countries from which such attacks originate or countries which take steps to restrict or monitor the Internet should consider themselves on notice.”58 It is not clear what that notice would say, given the rather weak public response from the State Department and the Executive Branch.\n\n53 Philip J.

It was widely reported that the National Security Agency, the cryptologic branch of the Department of Defense, entered into a secret agreement with Google after the intrusion. However, the NSA has never officially acknowledged a collaborative relationship with Google, and a recent United States Court of Appeals, District of Columbia Circuit Court decision, has made it clear that no information regarding any alleged agreement will be forthcoming and such an agreement, if it does exist, is exempt from freedom of information laws.^[59]^\n\n## 3. The Response of the Government of the People's Republic of China\n\nThe Chinese Government responded forcefully to the accusations made by both Google and the United States Government. In almost perfect Orwellian double-speak, the spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry indicated, in response that: \"It is China's consistent policy to promote the development of internet. China has its own national conditions and cultural traditions. It supervises internet according to law, which is in parallel with the international practice [sic].\"^[60]^ She went on to say that \"Hacking in whatever form and offence of others' privacy is prohibited by law in China. As a major victim of hacking in the world, China believes that the international community should intensify the cooperaion [sic] in jointly combating internet hacking so as to safeguard internet security and protect the privacy of citizens in accordance with law.\"^[61]^ So, the official position of the Government of China was that they were in no way responsible for the clandestine infiltration of Google's networks, and that the acts in question are considered criminal under Chinese domestic law.\n\nWhen confronted, China fervently denied having any role in the infiltration of Google's network. What makes this denial such meaningful evidence is that the United States Government - and the public through wikileaks - knew that the Chinese Government coordinated the intrusions of Google's systems and that the operation was directed at the Politburo Standing Committee level.^[62]^ While the public protest of the United States Government was weak and somewhat confusing, it certainly would not count as acquiescence toward the practice. However, in the face of this protest the Chinese Government did not seek to justify its conduct using legal argument or by relying on an existing or emerging customary legal rule. Rather, the Chinese Government completely denied the allegations. In fact, in their public response the Chinese Government pushes for more intense international cooperation to combat these occurrences.\n\nPut another way, there is no evidence of opinio juris surrounding the conduct of the states that engage in acts of economic cyber espionage or in the actions of the states that are victim. There has never been a public case of a state seeking to justify acts of cyber espionage as something that is defensible pursuant to international law. States do not feel compelled as a matter of legal obligation to engage in these acts, nor do states feel compelled to remain silent or acquiesce\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809828",

There is no rule of customary international law that justifies a breach of the principle of non-interference, because there is absolutely no *opinio juris* to support what is – in all reality – a thriving clandestine state practice. And while the response of the United States Government was weaker than one might have expected, the fact is that it was a long way from passive acquiescence toward the conduct.\n\n## PART III - TRANSNATIONAL LEGALISM AND CYBER GOVERNANCE\n\nAs the above example shows, the international governance regime surrounding cyber espionage is still in its infancy. As such, simply determining whether these actions are legal or illegal is not enough. Rather, the legal rules and the norms that govern conduct in cyber space are in a period of flux and evolution. In order to understand these changes, one must understand the process of transnational legal evolution. The “[t]ransnational legal process describes the theory and practice of how public and private actors -- nation-states, international organizations, multinational enterprises, non-governmental organizations, and private individuals -- interact in a variety of public and private, domestic and international fora to make, interpret, enforce, and ultimately, internalize rules of transnational law.”63\n\nIn this way, the lens of transnational legalism provides several distinct advantages over the more traditional binary legal/illegal analysis noted above. It describes the complex and dynamic connection between the formation of norms within the international community and the reception and interpretation of those norms into domestic law and practice, while also providing an account of the influence of domestic norms on the development of international rules. It allows for a better and more complete understanding of the role of non-state actors, which are increasingly central players within the international community; moving away from the strictures of the traditional state centric analytical framework allows for a more holistic understanding of global affairs and has significantly greater descriptive validity – because it can accurately account for the fast moving and multi-faceted transnational interactions in the realm of cyber security generally and cyber espionage.\n\nIn transnational practice, “repeated interactions among states and a variety of domestic and transnational actors produce interpretations of applicable global norms which can be and are eventually internalized into states’ domestic values and processes.”64 Under transnational legal theory, “various agents of internalization – which include transnational norm entrepreneurs, governmental norm sponsors, transnational issue networks, issue linkages and interpretive communities – can provoke nations to move from grudging compliance to habitual internalized obedience with international rules.”65 Given the foregoing, the value of this theoretical model does not stop at its descriptive validity; rather, it has “both predictive capacity and explanatory\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809828",

Thus, with respect to cyber espionage, the global community is engaged at the earlier stages of the transnational legal process of repeated interaction and interpretation. This ongoing process is further complicated by the fact that there are competing norms being advanced by major actors with conflicting geostrategic interests.\n\nRecent treaty negotiations aimed at Internet regulation broke down over divergent views over the role of the state in international Internet governance.69 The fault line between the United States and Europe, on the one hand, and a coalition of states led by Russia and China, on the other, has also been exposed in relation to the international norms applicable to information security. In September 2011, the Governments of China, the Russian Federation, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan sent a draft International Code of Conduct for information security to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General.\n\nUnder the terms of the Code of Conduct, each state voluntarily subscribing to the code pledges: “Not to use information and communications technologies, including networks, to carry out hostile activities or acts of aggression, pose threats to international peace and security”.70 At first blush, by sponsoring the Code of Conduct, it would appear that the Governments of China and Russia are prepared to voluntarily pledge not to use information and communications technologies to carry out hostile activities. Given that states now view network integrity as fundamental to their national security, covert network infiltration and economic cyber espionage is unquestionably a hostile act. Therefore, under the Code of Conduct, Russia and China are prepared to disavow the legitimacy of cyber espionage as a tool of strategic and economic policy. This, however, is completely disingenuous.\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809828",

According to a recent report from the Office of the National Counter Intelligence Executive, “Chinese actors are the world’s most active and persistent perpetrators of economic espionage. US private sector firms and cybersecurity specialists have reported an onslaught of computer network intrusions that have originated in China”.71 While at the same time “Russia’s intelligence services are conducting a range of activities to collect economic information and technology from US targets.”72\n\nThere are two main reasons that China and Russia engage in such aggressive economic cyber espionage, while at the same time they articulate a norm against it on the international stage. First, as a matter of geostrategic interest, “China and Russia view themselves as strategic competitors of the United States and are the most aggressive collectors of US economic information and technology.”73 Second, as a technical matter, these types of intrusions rarely get detected, and when they do they are notoriously difficult to attribute back to a state actor. As a consequence, Russia and China can act in a way that directly contradicts the norm that they are espousing, because there is a relatively low risk of discovery and attribution. It is not in their immediate interests to comply with that norm – the rewards are too high and the risks too low.\n\nAt the same time, countries like the United States and the United Kingdom are genuinely advocating for the establishment of, and reliance on, a comparable normative framework. Given the position of the United States as a global leader in intellectual property generation, it is not surprising that they would seek the enablement of a rules based regime that aims to hold the perpetrators of acts economic cyber espionage accountable for those actions. The most clear articulation of the policy of the United States Government toward acts of international economic cyber espionage is found in the May 2011 International Strategy for Cyber Space, signed by President Barack Obama. The International Strategy indicates:\n\nThe persistent theft of intellectual property, whether by criminals, foreign firms, or state actors working on their behalf, can erode competitiveness in the global economy, and businesses’ opportunities to innovate. The United States will take measures to identify and respond to such actions to help build an international environment that recognizes such acts as unlawful and impermissible, and hold such actors accountable.74\n\nGiven the foregoing it is not clear whether it is the position of the United States Government that the theft of intellectual property by state actors is currently recognized by the United States government as illegal, pursuant to international law, and that they are working to build on that within the international community. Or, if the United States Government will view this conduct as unlawful (pursuant to international law) once it has been accepted in the “international\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809828",

But, it is clear that it is not in either the short or long-term interests of the United States Government, or any similarly situated government, to allow economic cyber espionage to continue, constrained only by the vague notions of illegality provided by customary law. Because the United States does not spy for its domestic companies,75 it has no ability to engage in tit-for-tat diplomacy; meaning in response to the infiltration of Google’s network, there is no incentive for the United States to undertake a comparable infiltration of Baidu - the dominant Chinese search engine. It is, however, perfectly rational against this factual backdrop, for the United States to seek to advance a normative construct of illegality to constrain the behavior of other state actors. Thus, pushing for a clearer set of norms acts as one tool to attempt to influence the unwanted behaviors of other states.76\n\nIn this way, traditional notions of customary law or the internationalization of general principles do not adequately describe the contemporary governance mechanisms in place that address cyber espionage. Rather, the governance landscape is comprised of emerging norms of conduct, supported by major international actors, that are pursuing their interests and seeking to constrain the ability of other states to exploit the intellectual property and confidential information of the companies that operate in their territory or are regulated by them. At the same time, many states engage in covert network infiltrations into the networks of companies located in their competitor states for economic, as well as political, reasons. When these activities are exposed, states are careful to distance themselves from the conduct. As noted, this suggests that there is no opinio juris supporting the conduct, that it offends the principle of non-interference, and that there is no competing legal rule changing that. But the story does not stop there.\n\nAt the international level, states like the United States are pushing to have an explicit norm recognized within the international community that prohibits economic cyber espionage, rather than subsisting on the implied norm against it that comes as part of the principle of non-interference. At the domestic level the majority of states already prohibit the types of network intrusions, data interference and intercepts that form the tools of the cyber espionage trade. But, more importantly, these states also – in some instances – seek to prohibit this conduct extraterritoriality and they do so with a legitimate basis under international law. All of this creates a unique legal position for economic cyber espionage: it is implicitly prohibited under customary international law, with a normative push to make it explicitly prohibited, all while states use municipal law to prohibit the conduct domestically and transnationally. Layered on top of this is the trend toward allowing a more permissive regime for national security and non-economic related acts of cyber espionage.\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809828",

It is not surprising that the United States is pushing to create a strong normative and legal framework prohibiting acts of economic cyber espionage, because they have the most to lose and the least to gain from these types of activities. The United States generates major amounts of intellectual property and its firms routinely rely on sensitive and proprietary information in their business practices. At the same time, there is no ability within the United States’ system to translate stolen economic intelligence into an actionable intelligence product, because the United States does not have the ability to convey this stolen information to its domestic companies. After all, if the NSA were to steal the design for a revolutionary hybrid automotive engine from an Asian or European auto manufacturer, who would they give it to: Ford? General Motors? Chrysler? They would be effectively picking winners and losers in the free market economy, something which the United States Government tries not to do. It is also not surprising that the United States would seek a more permissive regime when it comes to security related intelligence, because the United States is widely believed to have the most sophisticated offensive cyber arsenal on the planet.\n\nHowever, this push to bifurcate the rules – with one set of rules for economically motivated cyber espionage and one set for security related cyber espionage – sets up an interesting problem. The difficulty is that this framework would require target states to understand the motivation behind a particular intrusion in order to accurately gage the legality of that act. It also presupposes that a clear line can be drawn between economic and security interests – which of course is not true. Suppose for example that State A dropped a logic bomb on the central server of the national bank in State B. What if the purpose of this act was to activate the nefarious code only in the event of a kinetic conflict between the two states to undermine the economy within the target state? But, what if the purpose of the logic bomb was solely to undermine consumer confidence in that bank and to push consumer and business investments elsewhere? The act, placing nefarious code on the server, is the exact same. It is only the motivation that differs. And, in cyberspace, it will be difficult if not impossible to accurately assess the motivation behind any particular act. Therefore, the notion of setting up a dual regime with permissive rules for security related espionage and restrictive rules for economic espionage rests on top of two fallacies. First, that a target can tell the difference between acts that are economic in nature versus those that are security related, and that there is an actual difference between the two. And second, that a target will be able to ascertain why a particular clandestine cyber act was undertaken. This bifurcation of espionage related activities is simply not a sustainable way to create realistic rules of the road for espionage in cyber space.\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809828",

  "full_text": "# CYBER ESPIONAGE AND INTERNATIONAL LAW\n## BY AARON SHULL\n## INTRODUCTION\nThe place of espionage under international law is an uneasy one. Many look to state practice, and conclude that acts of espionage must surely be legal because so many states spy on one another.¹ Others say that sending spies in to the territory of another state breaches the norm of territorial and sovereign integrity, and therefore acts of espionage should rightly be considered illegal pursuant to the relevant legal rules.² The difficulty in assessing legality is amplified when analyzing cyber intrusions, because they do not offend the principle of territorial integrity in the same way that sending an actual state agent to gather human intelligence (colloquially referred to as “HUMINT”) would. This paper is an attempt to address these legal ambiguities.\nHowever, because there is no public multilateral treaty that addresses acts of cyber espionage, recourse must be made to the customary rules to determine the position of espionage under international law. At its most basic level, customary law is comprised of the rules that emerge as a matter of past practice amongst nation states, and which come to govern future relations between them. The Statute of the International Court of Justice defines customary law as “evidence of a general practice accepted as law.” This has been interpreted to mean that for a customary norm of conduct to crystallize into a binding rule – gaining formal status under international law – two constituent criteria must be met. First, there must be widespread and consistent state practice. Second, the activity in question, or the abstinence of states from engaging in a particular activity, must be done out of a sense of legal compulsion. This second element, called *opinio juris*, is used to differentiate state actions that are legally obliged from those undertaken for some other purpose (like self-interest or comity).\nThe starting point for the application of international rules is the often cited *Lotus* principle, which asserts that a sovereign state may undertake any action they wish, as long as that action is not explicitly prohibited.³ The relevant question then becomes: Is there an explicit prohibition on acts of cyber espionage? The research goal of this paper is to answer that question, and in answering this question the paper will make three arguments.\nFirst, that despite the fact that states routinely spy on each other, there is no evidence to support the proposition that state actors view cyber espionage as something that is legal under customary\n¹ Geoffrey B.

A) No. 10, p. 28 (The Court distinguishes between cases that are binding as a matter of international law, and those which simply represent an ongoing non-obligatory form of conduct stating that “only if such abstention were based on their being conscious of having a duty to abstain would it be possible to speak of an international custom”).\nElectronic copy available at: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2809828\ninternational law. In this regard, while instances of cyber espionage may not offend the territorial integrity of the target state like human spying would, a sound legal conclusion can be drawn that certain intrusions will offend the principle of non-interference under international law. And, if cyber intrusions offend the principle of non-interference, they are correctly considered to be illegal pursuant to the relevant customary rules.\nSecond, the forces that influence the behavior of both state and non-state actors in relation to cyber espionage are much more complicated than a simple determination of legality. Cyber espionage may be illegal, but this vague notion of illegality pursuant to an even vaguer general rule of customary law acts as an extremely poor constraint on state behaviour. Poorly constrained, it is no surprise that states have engaged in a massive campaign of political, economic and military cyber espionage activities. However, many states view the current situation characterized by widespread (and largely unchecked) acts of cyber espionage as unsustainable. It is the explosion in the number of targets created by the Internet that has led the global community in to a process of what international relations scholars call ‘regime’ building, or what international lawyers call the ‘transnational legal process’. Simply put, the existing rules (both hard and soft) that govern behavior are evolving, and new rules are – or at the very least will be – emerging.\nThird, contemporary regime building efforts driven largely by the United States seem poised to build a bifurcated legal regime separating out economic espionage (aimed at private sector interests) from other more traditional forms (aimed largely at states). The most recent evidence of this came during high-level talks between the United States and China, when it became clear that the agenda of the United States was to establish restrictive prohibitions on economically oriented acts of cyber espionage alongside a more permissive regime for traditional security related espionage. After the first day of talks, an American official said in relation to the theft of intellectual property, “we don’t do it, and we don’t think any country should do it.”⁴ For its part, China does not see a comparable distinction between economic and military security. As an example, the China Daily – a government oriented publication – wrote that “by dividing cyberespionage into ‘bad’ and ‘good’ activities, Washington is trying to dictate the rules for global cyberdomain, which is a public space.”⁵ Thus, it seems clear that the normative ground is shifting. But given the divergent views among two of the main actors, it remains unclear how fast and how far these normative changes will go to actually curbing unwanted state behavior in cyber space.\nIn order to make these arguments, this paper will proceed as follows. Part I will set out the precise content of the norm of non-interference under international law. Part II will examine state practice and opinio juris in relation to cyber espionage through the lens of the 2010 clandestine entry into Google’s servers – termed operation Aurora – arguing that there is no opinio juris to support state practice and that, even when caught, states tend to deny responsibility for acts of cyber espionage. Part III examines the emerging trend toward a more robust regime, which seeks to place greater constraints on the commission of acts of cyber\n⁴ David E.

Finally, Part IV concludes with some recommendations regarding the potential course of evolution in this dynamic area of law.\n## PART I - THE NORM OF NON-INTERFERENCE UNDER INTERNATIONAL LAW AND CYBER ESPIONAGE\nAt its most basic level, the principle of non-interference provides, that “[n]o state has the right to intervene in the internal or external affairs of another.”⁶ This general statement of principle seems to elude precise quantification and the jurisprudence is largely unhelpful in determining with any level of specificity the content of the prohibition on foreign interference. The clearest articulation of the norm from the International Court of Justice is that the principle forbids intervention that has a “bearing on matters in which each State is permitted, by the principle of State sovereignty, to decide freely.”⁷ The utility of this observation is limited by the fact that the modern regulatory state is free to decide almost anything within its territory, and because there is a serious gap between what a broad view of the norm of non-interference would require and what states actually do in their conduct toward one another.⁸ For that reason, determining the content of the norm with precision will require a case-by-case analysis to determine whether the specific conduct in question - in this case cyber espionage - falls within the scope of the prohibition.\nThere have been two broadly supported United Nations General Assembly Resolutions that have some bearing on the scope of the principle. The first is the 1965 the Declaration on the Inadmissibility of Intervention in the Domestic Affairs of States and the Protection of their Independence and Sovereignty (“Declaration on Intervention”).⁹ The second is the 1970 Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States in Accordance with the Charter of the United Nations (“Friendly Relations Declaration”).¹⁰ These two documents are strikingly similar, with only modest differences. The relevant operative paragraph of the Friendly Relations Declaration is slightly more robust, stating:\nNo State or group of States has the right to intervene, directly or indirectly, for any reason whatever, in the internal or external affairs of any other State. Consequently, armed intervention and all other forms of interference or attempted threats against the personality of the State or against its political, economic and cultural elements, are in violation of international law.¹¹\nThus, within the Friendly Relations Declaration, which is widely regarded to reflect customary\nElectronic copy available at: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2809828\n6 Montevideo Convention on the Rights and Duties of States, Dec. 26, 1933, 49 Stat. 3097, TS No. 881, 165 LNTS 19, Art. 8.\n7 Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua (Nicar. v. U.S.), Judgment, 1986 I.C.J. 14, 205 (June 27).\n8 See Lori Fisler Damrosch, *Politics Across Borders: Nonintervention and Nonforcible Influence Over Domestic Affairs*, 83 AM. J.

Res. 2625 (XXV), U.N. Doc. A/RES/2625(XXV) (Oct. 24, 1970).\nlaw,¹² there is an explicit prohibition on any form of interference with the political, economic and cultural elements of another state. However, the International Court of Justice narrowed this broad articulation in the Nicaragua decision, noting that:\nA prohibited intervention must accordingly be one bearing on matters in which each State is permitted, by the principle of State sovereignty, to decide freely. One of these is the choice of a political, economic, social and cultural system, and the formulation of foreign policy. Intervention is wrongful when it uses methods of coercion in regard to such choices, which must remain free ones.¹³\nThe problem is that the Court does not go on to define with any level of specificity what the content of the prohibition on interference actually is. The Court indicates that in order to be prohibited under international law an intervention must be one bearing on matters that each State is permitted, by the principle of State sovereignty, to decide freely. Unfortunately, rather than clarifying this position, the Court – curiously – goes on to consider whether there is any customary international law allowing intervention. Thus, the actual content of the norm of non-interference is left ill-defined and extremely vague.\nThe Nicaragua decision is further limited by the fact that it is decided at that outset that the \"Court will define only those aspects of the principle which appear to be relevant to the resolution of the dispute.\"¹⁴ In this respect this case is lacking because, in many ways, the discussion of non-interference/non-intervention is subsumed within the larger discussion of the prohibition on the use of force that is the immediate subject matter of the decision. Therefore, the decision really provides only a partial discussion of the principle of non-interference. The Court explicitly chooses to discuss only those aspects of the principle relevant to the case before it. By definition then, the principle of non-interference goes beyond the narrow articulation presented by the Court. Consequently, states and legal scholars alike were left with only a partial explanation of the rule and with an unfinished legal test to determine which acts will actually offend the rule against foreign interference. What if any relevance does this limited test have for determining if a particular act of cyber espionage will offend the principle against non-interference? The simple answer is not much.\nPursuant to the test for interference posited in the Nicaragua case, in order to fall within the definition of prohibited intervention, the act in question must be intended to force or coerce a change of policy within the victim state. This formulation is not without support in the literature. Russell Buchan recently put forward a rote articulation of this test, in relation to cyber interference. Buchan argues:\nAll in all, in order to establish a violation of the non-intervention principle two questions must be addressed. First, is the intervention intended to force the victim State into a change of policy? [...] Secondly, if the intention to impose coercion is present, it must then be asked whether the application of coercion bears upon matters\n¹² Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua (Nicar. v. U.S.), Judgment, 1986 I.C.J. 14, 202 (June 27) (“The principle of non-intervention involves the right of every sovereign State to conduct its affairs without outside interference; though examples of trespass against this principle are not infrequent, the Court considers that it is part and parcel of customary international law.”).\n¹³ Ibid., 205 (emphasis added).\n¹⁴ Ibid.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809828\nwhich a state is entitled to freely determine itself.¹⁵\nThe problem is that adopting this legal standard would exclude from international regulation all acts of cyber aggression that had no physical (or kinetic) effect,¹⁶ and which were motived by something other than a desire to influence policy within the target state. As an example, in February of 2011 the Internet security firm, McAfee, uncovered a major network infiltration using IP addresses located in China. The intrusion, labeled “Night Dragon”, targeted Western oil and energy companies and “[t]he goal of the intrusions was to obtain information on sensitive competitive proprietary operations and on financing of oil and gas field bids and operations.”¹⁷ In this case, valuable proprietary information was stolen and a significant benefit would have accrued to the relevant Chinese agencies or firms. However, because the objective was to obtain sensitive information and to use it against Chinese competitors, according to the circumspect test of the International Court of Justice in Nicaragua or the analysis put forward by Buchan, this would not qualify as an unlawful intervention or interference. This is because the breach was not intended to change a policy within the victim state.\nThis notion is deeply problematic given that the gravamen of the offence of unlawful interference is intervening in to the sphere over which the target state has authority. States – acting in their capacity as a sovereign – have the ability to regulate telecommunications, Internet service providers, intellectual property rights, and criminal sanctions related to data breaches. The exercise of these rights has nothing to do with the intent of the offending party. Rather, the right itself flows from state sovereignty. It is the intervention within the affairs of a sovereign state that is offensive, regardless of the intent of the intervening party.\nHowever, given the limits of the applicable jurisprudence, all that can really be said about the status of the law is that it remains unclear and ill-suited to address clandestine cyber intrusions. The law is unclear because there is no authoritative decision that unequivocally demarcates the boundaries of an independent right of non-interference. The law is ill-suited to address cyber intrusions, because if a requisite element of the test of non-interference is the requirement to influence policy in the target state, then intrusions that are motivated by some other desire (i.e. economics) and which are meant to remain covert will rarely – if ever – meet this threshold. Employing a purposive (intent based) analysis to determine whether or not a covert cyber entry will offend the principle of non-interference is inappropriate because it sets up an impossible test – how can one ever know what the intention is behind a clandestine network entry?\n¹⁵ Russell Buchan, *Cyber Attacks: Unlawful Uses of Force or Prohibited Interventions?* 2 J. OF CONFLICT &amp; SEC. L. 211, 224-225.\n¹⁶ These would likely be governed under Article 2(4) of the United Nations Charter as a use of force. See Matthew C. Waxman, *Cyber-Attacks and the Use of Force: Back to the Future of Article 2(4)*, 36 YALE J. INT'L L. 421 (“there is considerable momentum among American scholars and policy experts behind the idea that some cyber-attacks ought to fall within Article 2(4)'s prohibition of \"force\" or could constitute an \"armed attack,\" at least insofar as those terms should be interpreted to cover attacks with features and consequences closely resembling conventional military attacks or kinetic force.”).\n¹⁷ See OFFICE OF THE NAT'L COUNTERINTELLIGENCE EXEC., *FOREIGN SPIES STEALING US ECONOMIC SECRETS IN CYBERSPACE: REPORT TO CONGRESS ON FOREIGN ECONOMIC COLLECTION AND INDUSTRIAL ESPIONAGE*, 2009-2011, 5 (2011) [COUNTERINTELLIGENCE REPORT].\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809828\nNotwithstanding these challenges, there is limited support within the literature for the proposition that acts of cyber espionage will offend the principle of non-interference. In this regard, Mary Ellen O'Connell writes:\nJust because a cyber-attack or cyber espionage do not amount to an armed attack does not mean that international law has no law against such wrongs. Interference with a State's economic sphere, air space, maritime space or territorial space, even if not prohibited by treaty is prohibited under the general principle of non-intervention. This is apparent in a number of treaties, UN resolutions and ICJ decisions that condemn coercion, interference or intervention that falls short of the use of force.¹⁸\nEven with this limited scholarly support, the actual content of the norm against cyber interference remains amorphous. Surely the norm would not encompass every mild cyber incident, but it must still protect the customary norm that “every sovereign state [has a right] to conduct its affairs without outside interference.”¹⁹ By definition then, determining which cyber intrusions offend the principle of non-interference and which do not will be an exercise in legal line drawing. Suppose for example that State A plans to infiltrate a functioning nuclear power plant in State B. The purpose is to force B to change a foreign policy position. When B decides not to change its position, A activates previously placed nefarious code, or “logic bomb”,²⁰ and causes a meltdown. This would offend both the prohibition on the use of force and easily offend the principle of non-interference. However, suppose B infiltrates the network of the company that makes the reactor to steal industrial designs, recognizing a major cost savings in the establishment of a domestic nuclear power industry. Would this offend the principle of non-interference? What if B just looks at the designs but does not use them for any purpose?\nThese examples demonstrate a clear need to rearticulate the test for prohibited interference in relation to cyber intrusions, moving away from a test that is based on the intent of the offending party to one based on the potential effect of the intrusion. The principle of non-interference is often said to be a corollary of the principle of state sovereignty.²¹ A corollary is something which is a “proposition that follows from a proven proposition with little or no additional proof; something that naturally flows.”²² In this way, the content of the norm of non-interference should naturally follow the contours of the principle of state sovereignty. Thus, if the intrusion\n¹⁸ Mary Ellen O'Connell, *Cyber Security without Cyber War*, 2 J. OF CONFLICT &amp; SEC.

This is a permissible interpretation of the rule, because as noted above, the International Court of Justice’s previous ruling on the issue dealt with only a narrow application of the norm and only to the extent that was necessary to deal with matters immediately before it in the Nicaragua case.\nIf one adopts this rearticulated effects based test, then covert entry into networks accompanied by the stealing of intellectual property, which undermines confidence in the Internet and telecommunications generally,²³ threatens national security,²⁴ or undermines the financial position or competiveness of domestic companies²⁵ – and the corresponding revenue base of their governments – could potentially offend the principle of non-interference. This would necessarily be subject to the doctrine of de minimis non curat lex, or the idea that the law does not concern itself with trifles. Thus, in order to offend the principle, there should be some significant effect attached to the cyber intrusion. If, these criteria are met, then a reasonable reading of the principle of non-interference as articulated in Declaration on Intervention and the Friendly Relations Declaration, which are considered to be customary law, would recognize these events as prohibited.\nThe main anticipated critique to the conception of a norm of non-interference that that would prohibit these forms of cyber intrusions is that state practice diverges markedly from it. Universally, articles on the law of espionage rely on the fact that many states engage in espionage as a justification for its legality. The thrust of the response is that secret state practice is legally irrelevant. The fact that states hide their behavior reinforces the existence of a prohibition, but more importantly, there is strong authority for the proposition that secret state practice is a deficient and unsatisfactory marker in the establishment of a legal rule, or change in its content.²⁶ According to the International Law Association’s Committee on Formation of Customary (General) International Law, a “secret physical act (e.g. secretly “bugging” diplomatic premises) is probably not an example of the objective element.

There is simply no compelling reason for secret state practice to change the rules of public international law.\n## PART II – CYBER ESPIONAGE AND STATE PRACTICE\nEvaluating state practice in relation to the collection of intelligence from human sources or through signals intercepts is difficult for obvious reasons, not least of which is the fact that these activities are meant to be clandestine. Evaluating the practice of states in relation to espionage committed via the Internet is more difficult still, because not only are the activities clandestine, but there are significant challenges with both technical and legal attribution, and even when breaches are uncovered, in many cases the victims are corporations – not states – and often times they do not report the breaches to their own government.²⁹\nTherefore, employing case study methodology has distinct advantages over generalizations regarding state practice in this area. However, owing to the furtive character of espionage, selecting an appropriate case for study presents its own challenges. The surreptitious infiltration into the Google network discovered in 2010, termed Operation Aurora, was selected for study not only because of its high level of publicity, but also because it provoked a rare public response from the two major governments involved, the United States and China.\nCertainly, there are disadvantages to employing case study methodology as well. More particularly, employing a single case study fails to account for the fact that many governments routinely engage in acts of economic espionage aimed squarely at private actors within competitor states.³⁰ It is also requires generalization from one particular case, involving two state actors, to the wider groups of states. This has significant drawbacks because states do not behave in a uniform fashion, they are not motivated or constrained by the same things, and may take a differing view of a particular act. It is also impossible to ever truly know what is motivating a state to undertake a particular course of action. The fact is that generalizing from one observation is a poor mechanism for understanding the motivations of state behavior in a wider context. However, undertaking a detailed case study analysis of the actual conduct of an\nMedia of Rules, 13 GERMAN L.J. 1508, 1518 (“Following the disastrous experience with secret treaties in the lead up to World War I, and responding to demands for transparency from citizens as democracy expanded, states agreed to prohibit secret treaties in international law.

Nation states and criminals target our government and private sector information networks to gain competitive advantage in the commercial sector.”).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809828\ninfiltration that has been publicly exposed is valuable, notwithstanding its drawbacks. The rare public glimpse into the otherwise murky world of international espionage provides valuable evidence for the evaluation of both state practice and opinio juris regarding these actions.\nWhen evaluating the significance of state practice in relation to customary legal rules and espionage, it is a mistake simply to evaluate the conduct of the state that has engaged in the offensive operations. Rather, when operations are uncovered, the response of the offended government is just as, if not more important. Thus, the Google infiltration provides an uncommon example, where a major corporation publicly disclosed the infiltration first, forcing the governments of both states to respond. For that reason, this section will evaluate not only the conduct attributed to the Chinese government in relation to the infiltration of Google and Operation Aurora, but also the response of the United States Government.\n## 1. The Aurora Exploit\nOn January 12, 2010, David Drummond, Senior Vice-President and Chief Legal Officer of Google publicly disclosed that his company had fallen victim to a major network infiltration. Drummond indicated on the company's official blog, that Google had “detected a highly sophisticated and targeted attack on our corporate infrastructure originating from China that resulted in the theft of intellectual property from Google.”³¹ During their internal investigations into the infiltration, the company determined that at least twenty other large companies in the Internet, finance, technology, media and chemical sectors were also targeted. They also uncovered evidence to suggest that “a primary goal of the attackers was accessing the Gmail accounts of Chinese human rights activists.”³²\nAccording to subsequent investigations undertaken by the Internet security firm, McAfee, Operation Aurora initially targeted an individual user within Google. This individual would then receive a link in either an email or through an instant message that purported to be from a trusted source. Once the targeted user clicked on the link at their computer, they would be directed to a website hosted on servers in Taiwan that contained a malicious JavaScript payload.³³ Once at the nefarious website, the Internet browser program being used to view the website automatically downloaded and executed the malicious program code, which included a zero-day Internet Explorer exploit.³⁴ The exploit then executed the malicious payload, which set up a backdoor³⁵ and the networked computer of the unsuspecting user was then remotely connected to command\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809828\n³¹ David Drummond, *A new approach to China*, GOOGLE: OFFICIAL BLOG (Jan. 12, 2010) http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/01/new-approach-to-china.html\n³² David Drummond, *A new approach to China*, GOOGLE: OFFICIAL BLOG (Jan. 12, 2010) http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/01/new-approach-to-china.html\n³³ In basic terms, JavaScript is computer-coding language employed in numerous popular applications including websites and PDFs.\n³⁴ A zero-day exploit is the term of art among software developers and hackers that refers to a previously unknown vulnerability in a computer application. The use of the term zero-day, is meant to connote that the first attack on the software takes place on “day zero” of vulnerability awareness on the part of the software developer. It also means that the software developers have had zero days to develop a software “patch” that addresses the vulnerability in question.\n³⁵ When attempting to remotely access a computer there is typically an authentication process, which ensures that the party seeking access is entitled to that access. By placing a “back door” on the system, the party seeking access can bypass the normal process of authentication and can have virtually unfettered access to the target system.\nand control servers in Taiwan. Once connected to these command servers the “attackers had complete access to internal systems. They targeted sources of intellectual property, including software configuration management (SCM) systems accessible by the compromised system.”³⁶\nThe methods employed during the exploit seem clear. However, actually attributing that covert network exploitation back to the Chinese Government is a different story. In this respect, one report prepared for the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission by Northrop Grumman Corp stated that:\nThe publicly disclosed evidence linking Chinese state sponsorship to the Google intrusion is compelling but still largely circumstantial. Analysis of the malware by third party specialists identified only a small component of the overall code that clearly had a Chinese pedigree; the information targeted was both Google source code and email accounts reportedly of Chinese human rights activists, suggesting a political as well as economic motivation. The IP addresses for the C2 nodes discovered during the forensic investigation were attributed to a Chinese college that has been linked in the past to alleged state sponsored network exploitation activity.³⁷\nHowever, in a leaked classified cable from the United States Embassy in Beijing, the United States government was informed that “[a] well-placed contact claims that the Chinese government coordinated the recent intrusions of Google systems. According to our contact, the closely held operations were directed at the Politburo Standing Committee level.”³⁸ While according to the same cable, “Another contact claimed a top PRC leader was actively working with Google competitor Baidu against Google.”³⁹ In the world of intelligence gathering, there are few certainties; but this cable is close. Although undated, it seems clear that the United States Government was advised shortly after Operation Aurora, and in no uncertain terms, that the infiltration was directed at the Politburo Standing Committee level. The Politburo Standing Committee consists of the top leadership of the Communist Party of China and is the most powerful decision-making body of the Chinese Government.\n## 2. The Response of the United States Government\nThe response of the United States Government was confusing and watered down. It was confusing because it did not reflect the reality of what the United States Government knew had taken place. It was watered down, because the response morphed over time, from what looked like a strong protest, to a situation where the State Department would not even use the word *demarche*⁴⁰ to classify their response toward the Chinese Government.\n³⁶ MCAFEE LABS AND MCAFEE FOUNDSTONE PROFESSIONAL SERVICES, PROTECTING YOUR CRITICAL ASSETS: LESSONS LEARNED FROM “OPERATION AURORA”, available at http://www.mcafee.com/us/resources/white-papers/wp-protecting-critical-assets.pdf.\n³⁷ BRYAN KREKEL, PATTON ADAMS &amp; GEORGE BAKOS, OCCUPYING THE INFORMATION HIGH GROUND: CHINESE CAPABILITIES FOR COMPUTER NETWORK OPERATIONS AND CYBER ESPIONAGE 99, Prepared for the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission by Northrop Grumman Corp.

We look to the Chinese government for an explanation.”41 Then, merely one day later, Assistant Secretary of State, Phillip Crowley, in response to a question on the Google infiltration stated that: “I wouldn’t say that this is necessarily different than the range of issues that we continue to work on with China.”42 Thus, the official response morphed in less than 24 hours, from one of serious concern regarding the covert infiltration of Google, to one in which this issue was no different, or more important, then the other issues involved in the bilateral relations between the two states.\nThe tone changed again the following day. During the January 14, 2010, press briefing Assistant Secretary of State Crowley stated that “this is – it’s a serious issue on a number of levels. As we have talked about, there are business standards and expectations, international norms that you expect your business partners to live up to. And we have had multiple conversations with China about activity both in this area and more broadly.”43 He then went on to state that: “We [the United States Government] have raised this issue today in saying that we have serious concerns about this and its ramifications.”44\nThen on January 15, 2010, the United States Government decided to issue a diplomatic demarche. During the press briefing, Assistant Secretary of State Crowley stated that: “We will be issuing a formal demarche to the Chinese Government in Beijing on this issue in the coming days, probably early next week. [It] will express our concern for this incident and request information from China as to an explanation of how it happened and what they plan to do about it.”45 Notwithstanding this unambiguous statement regarding the issuance of a demarche, it is important to note that a demarche is simply formal diplomatic representation of a government’s official position. They can be used as a mechanism to protest or object to actions by a foreign government, but do not necessarily imply the illegality of those actions. Certainly a government may use a demarche to register its position that a certain act undertaken by a foreign government contravened international law, but this will depend entirely on the wording of the document.\nStill, there was a significant softening of this position on January 19, 2010. On that day during the press briefing, Assistant Secretary of State Kurt M. Campbell was asked “whether that\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809828\ndemarche has been formally issued over the Google case\".46 Campbell responded that the United States Government has had \"multiple meetings with Chinese authorities\" that they \"take this matter very seriously\" and that \"the whole issue does raise serious concerns.\"47 The language of using a diplomatic demarche had disappeared from the parlance of the State Department; instead now the United States Government was content to ask \"them [the Government of China] for an explanation.\"48 Later that day in a separate briefing, Assistant Secretary of State Crowley was asked \"has that demarche been issued and can you tell us what it says?\". The response was terse: \"Kurt [Assistant Secretary of State Campbell] made clear that he had – he said what he said. I'm not going to go further.\"49\nOn January 21, 2010, Secretary of State Clinton spoke on Internet freedom, and during those remarks, she commented that the \"recent situation involving Google has attracted a great deal of interest. And we look to the Chinese authorities to conduct a thorough review of the cyber intrusions that led Google to make its announcement. And we also look for that investigation and its results to be transparent.\"50 The Secretary made no mention of a demarche or other formal rebuke.\nThen on January 22, 2010 the Washington Post reported that a demarche had already been issued, \"according to a State Department official\".51 However, any ambiguity regarding the issuance of the demarche was removed on January 22, 2010, when Assistant Secretary of State Crowley was pointedly asked \"Did you or did you not issue a demarche?\", his response: \"No. Not yet.\"52 Then on February 19, 2010, Crowley was questioned again about the United States formal diplomatic response to the covert infiltration of Google's network. The question: \"I was just wondering - going back to that Goggle [sic] case, there was the discussion that the U.S. is trying to lodge a formal complaint - a demarche on Goggle [sic]. I'm wondering if that has happened or hasn't, and if not, why not?\" The response:\nMR. CROWLEY: Well, I think the – we have had multiple conversations with Chinese officials on this issue, and that included a direct conversation between Secretary Clinton and Foreign Minister Yang in London late last month. So I think we have satisfied ourselves that the Chinese understand the importance with which we view this issue. We have called on the Chinese to conduct a thorough review of cyber intrusions. And they are obviously in the best\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809828\nposition to evaluate what has and continues to occur within their borders.\nQUESTION: So – but just to follow on that, I mean, if the U.S. Government says it's going to make a formal demarche, then it doesn't, does that mean that there's been a change in the assessment of the situation on the ground?\nMR. CROWLEY: Well, I mean, if – a demarche can be a written statement. It can be a verbal statement. The Secretary directly engaged Foreign Minister Yang on this issue. So if you want to call that a demarche – I think we have done what we set out to do, which is to directly express our concerns at high levels about this activity and to encourage China to investigate it thoroughly.53\nIt seems plain that the position of the United States Government morphs over time. The position fluctuates from a issuing a formal demarche to the Chinese Government in Beijing, which expressed serious concern, to a position where the State Department was unwilling to refer to their actions in those terms, referring instead to “high level talks” and “engagement”. The final softening of the United States’ response came several months after the initial announcement by Google.\nOn March 19, 2010 Secretary of State Clinton was asked: “What has the Chinese Government told you about their investigation? What kind of pressure are you putting on the Chinese Government?”. The response from the Secretary of State was: “Well, specifically, with respect to Google, this is really between Google and China.”54 There was no indication that there was any formal response from the Chinese government related to an investigation or any hint that the Chinese Government had shared a plan to interdict these types of infiltrations.\nFor its part, the United States Congress had a less equivocal response. Senate Resolution 405 was introduced on February 2, 2010. It stated that the Senate: “Condemns the cyber attacks allegedly launched from China against Google and other companies and calls on the government of China to review such cyber intrusions.”55 The Resolution was co-sponsored by senior senators from both parties including Senators McCain, Lieberman, Specter and Feingold. It was considered, and agreed to without amendment and with a preamble by Unanimous Consent.56 The Preamble states, “this attack was one in a series of attempts to exploit security flaws and illegally access computer networks of individuals and institutions through the clandestine installation of phishing and malware technology.”57 Senator Kaufman rose two days later, and said on the Senate Floor, that “[w]ith the passage of this resolution, countries from which such attacks originate or countries which take steps to restrict or monitor the Internet should consider themselves on notice.”58 It is not clear what that notice would say, given the rather weak public response from the State Department and the Executive Branch.\n53 Philip J.

It was widely reported that the National Security Agency, the cryptologic branch of the Department of Defense, entered into a secret agreement with Google after the intrusion. However, the NSA has never officially acknowledged a collaborative relationship with Google, and a recent United States Court of Appeals, District of Columbia Circuit Court decision, has made it clear that no information regarding any alleged agreement will be forthcoming and such an agreement, if it does exist, is exempt from freedom of information laws.^[59]^\n## 3. The Response of the Government of the People's Republic of China\nThe Chinese Government responded forcefully to the accusations made by both Google and the United States Government. In almost perfect Orwellian double-speak, the spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry indicated, in response that: \"It is China's consistent policy to promote the development of internet. China has its own national conditions and cultural traditions. It supervises internet according to law, which is in parallel with the international practice [sic].\"^[60]^ She went on to say that \"Hacking in whatever form and offence of others' privacy is prohibited by law in China. As a major victim of hacking in the world, China believes that the international community should intensify the cooperaion [sic] in jointly combating internet hacking so as to safeguard internet security and protect the privacy of citizens in accordance with law.\"^[61]^ So, the official position of the Government of China was that they were in no way responsible for the clandestine infiltration of Google's networks, and that the acts in question are considered criminal under Chinese domestic law.\nWhen confronted, China fervently denied having any role in the infiltration of Google's network. What makes this denial such meaningful evidence is that the United States Government - and the public through wikileaks - knew that the Chinese Government coordinated the intrusions of Google's systems and that the operation was directed at the Politburo Standing Committee level.^[62]^ While the public protest of the United States Government was weak and somewhat confusing, it certainly would not count as acquiescence toward the practice. However, in the face of this protest the Chinese Government did not seek to justify its conduct using legal argument or by relying on an existing or emerging customary legal rule. Rather, the Chinese Government completely denied the allegations. In fact, in their public response the Chinese Government pushes for more intense international cooperation to combat these occurrences.\nPut another way, there is no evidence of opinio juris surrounding the conduct of the states that engage in acts of economic cyber espionage or in the actions of the states that are victim. There has never been a public case of a state seeking to justify acts of cyber espionage as something that is defensible pursuant to international law. States do not feel compelled as a matter of legal obligation to engage in these acts, nor do states feel compelled to remain silent or acquiesce\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809828\nwhen they fall victim. There is no rule of customary international law that justifies a breach of the principle of non-interference, because there is absolutely no *opinio juris* to support what is – in all reality – a thriving clandestine state practice. And while the response of the United States Government was weaker than one might have expected, the fact is that it was a long way from passive acquiescence toward the conduct.\n## PART III - TRANSNATIONAL LEGALISM AND CYBER GOVERNANCE\nAs the above example shows, the international governance regime surrounding cyber espionage is still in its infancy. As such, simply determining whether these actions are legal or illegal is not enough. Rather, the legal rules and the norms that govern conduct in cyber space are in a period of flux and evolution. In order to understand these changes, one must understand the process of transnational legal evolution. The “[t]ransnational legal process describes the theory and practice of how public and private actors -- nation-states, international organizations, multinational enterprises, non-governmental organizations, and private individuals -- interact in a variety of public and private, domestic and international fora to make, interpret, enforce, and ultimately, internalize rules of transnational law.”63\nIn this way, the lens of transnational legalism provides several distinct advantages over the more traditional binary legal/illegal analysis noted above. It describes the complex and dynamic connection between the formation of norms within the international community and the reception and interpretation of those norms into domestic law and practice, while also providing an account of the influence of domestic norms on the development of international rules. It allows for a better and more complete understanding of the role of non-state actors, which are increasingly central players within the international community; moving away from the strictures of the traditional state centric analytical framework allows for a more holistic understanding of global affairs and has significantly greater descriptive validity – because it can accurately account for the fast moving and multi-faceted transnational interactions in the realm of cyber security generally and cyber espionage.\nIn transnational practice, “repeated interactions among states and a variety of domestic and transnational actors produce interpretations of applicable global norms which can be and are eventually internalized into states’ domestic values and processes.”64 Under transnational legal theory, “various agents of internalization – which include transnational norm entrepreneurs, governmental norm sponsors, transnational issue networks, issue linkages and interpretive communities – can provoke nations to move from grudging compliance to habitual internalized obedience with international rules.”65 Given the foregoing, the value of this theoretical model does not stop at its descriptive validity; rather, it has “both predictive capacity and explanatory\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809828\npower regarding questions of causation.\"66 Transnational legal theory predicts that nations are most likely to comply with international norms if transnational legal processes are “aggressively triggered by other transnational actors in a way that forces interaction in forums capable of generating norms, followed by norm-internalization.”67 This process of “interaction and internalization in turn leads a national government to engage in new modes of interest-recognition and identity-formation in a way that eventually leads the nation-state back into compliance.”68\nWhile it is appropriate to conclude that certain acts of cyber espionage are illegal as a matter of international law, and that there is no countervailing customary norm that provides a legal excuse or justification, it is equally appropriate to conclude that the raging practice of cyber espionage among states means that many have yet to subscribe to the norm and to internalize it in their conduct. Thus, with respect to cyber espionage, the global community is engaged at the earlier stages of the transnational legal process of repeated interaction and interpretation. This ongoing process is further complicated by the fact that there are competing norms being advanced by major actors with conflicting geostrategic interests.\nRecent treaty negotiations aimed at Internet regulation broke down over divergent views over the role of the state in international Internet governance.69 The fault line between the United States and Europe, on the one hand, and a coalition of states led by Russia and China, on the other, has also been exposed in relation to the international norms applicable to information security. In September 2011, the Governments of China, the Russian Federation, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan sent a draft International Code of Conduct for information security to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General.\nUnder the terms of the Code of Conduct, each state voluntarily subscribing to the code pledges: “Not to use information and communications technologies, including networks, to carry out hostile activities or acts of aggression, pose threats to international peace and security”.70 At first blush, by sponsoring the Code of Conduct, it would appear that the Governments of China and Russia are prepared to voluntarily pledge not to use information and communications technologies to carry out hostile activities. Given that states now view network integrity as fundamental to their national security, covert network infiltration and economic cyber espionage is unquestionably a hostile act. Therefore, under the Code of Conduct, Russia and China are prepared to disavow the legitimacy of cyber espionage as a tool of strategic and economic policy. This, however, is completely disingenuous.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809828\nThe fact is that both Russia and China are most persistent collectors of economic intelligence. According to a recent report from the Office of the National Counter Intelligence Executive, “Chinese actors are the world’s most active and persistent perpetrators of economic espionage. US private sector firms and cybersecurity specialists have reported an onslaught of computer network intrusions that have originated in China”.71 While at the same time “Russia’s intelligence services are conducting a range of activities to collect economic information and technology from US targets.”72\nThere are two main reasons that China and Russia engage in such aggressive economic cyber espionage, while at the same time they articulate a norm against it on the international stage. First, as a matter of geostrategic interest, “China and Russia view themselves as strategic competitors of the United States and are the most aggressive collectors of US economic information and technology.”73 Second, as a technical matter, these types of intrusions rarely get detected, and when they do they are notoriously difficult to attribute back to a state actor. As a consequence, Russia and China can act in a way that directly contradicts the norm that they are espousing, because there is a relatively low risk of discovery and attribution. It is not in their immediate interests to comply with that norm – the rewards are too high and the risks too low.\nAt the same time, countries like the United States and the United Kingdom are genuinely advocating for the establishment of, and reliance on, a comparable normative framework. Given the position of the United States as a global leader in intellectual property generation, it is not surprising that they would seek the enablement of a rules based regime that aims to hold the perpetrators of acts economic cyber espionage accountable for those actions. The most clear articulation of the policy of the United States Government toward acts of international economic cyber espionage is found in the May 2011 International Strategy for Cyber Space, signed by President Barack Obama. The International Strategy indicates:\nThe persistent theft of intellectual property, whether by criminals, foreign firms, or state actors working on their behalf, can erode competitiveness in the global economy, and businesses’ opportunities to innovate. The United States will take measures to identify and respond to such actions to help build an international environment that recognizes such acts as unlawful and impermissible, and hold such actors accountable.74\nGiven the foregoing it is not clear whether it is the position of the United States Government that the theft of intellectual property by state actors is currently recognized by the United States government as illegal, pursuant to international law, and that they are working to build on that within the international community. Or, if the United States Government will view this conduct as unlawful (pursuant to international law) once it has been accepted in the “international\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809828\nenvironment”. But, it is clear that it is not in either the short or long-term interests of the United States Government, or any similarly situated government, to allow economic cyber espionage to continue, constrained only by the vague notions of illegality provided by customary law. Because the United States does not spy for its domestic companies,75 it has no ability to engage in tit-for-tat diplomacy; meaning in response to the infiltration of Google’s network, there is no incentive for the United States to undertake a comparable infiltration of Baidu - the dominant Chinese search engine. It is, however, perfectly rational against this factual backdrop, for the United States to seek to advance a normative construct of illegality to constrain the behavior of other state actors. Thus, pushing for a clearer set of norms acts as one tool to attempt to influence the unwanted behaviors of other states.76\nIn this way, traditional notions of customary law or the internationalization of general principles do not adequately describe the contemporary governance mechanisms in place that address cyber espionage. Rather, the governance landscape is comprised of emerging norms of conduct, supported by major international actors, that are pursuing their interests and seeking to constrain the ability of other states to exploit the intellectual property and confidential information of the companies that operate in their territory or are regulated by them. At the same time, many states engage in covert network infiltrations into the networks of companies located in their competitor states for economic, as well as political, reasons. When these activities are exposed, states are careful to distance themselves from the conduct. As noted, this suggests that there is no opinio juris supporting the conduct, that it offends the principle of non-interference, and that there is no competing legal rule changing that. But the story does not stop there.\nAt the international level, states like the United States are pushing to have an explicit norm recognized within the international community that prohibits economic cyber espionage, rather than subsisting on the implied norm against it that comes as part of the principle of non-interference. At the domestic level the majority of states already prohibit the types of network intrusions, data interference and intercepts that form the tools of the cyber espionage trade. But, more importantly, these states also – in some instances – seek to prohibit this conduct extraterritoriality and they do so with a legitimate basis under international law. All of this creates a unique legal position for economic cyber espionage: it is implicitly prohibited under customary international law, with a normative push to make it explicitly prohibited, all while states use municipal law to prohibit the conduct domestically and transnationally. Layered on top of this is the trend toward allowing a more permissive regime for national security and non-economic related acts of cyber espionage.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809828\n# PART IV – CONCLUSIONS\nAt this point in time, it is not entirely clear how the legal rules or norms of conduct will develop within this policy space. It is not surprising that the United States is pushing to create a strong normative and legal framework prohibiting acts of economic cyber espionage, because they have the most to lose and the least to gain from these types of activities. The United States generates major amounts of intellectual property and its firms routinely rely on sensitive and proprietary information in their business practices. At the same time, there is no ability within the United States’ system to translate stolen economic intelligence into an actionable intelligence product, because the United States does not have the ability to convey this stolen information to its domestic companies. After all, if the NSA were to steal the design for a revolutionary hybrid automotive engine from an Asian or European auto manufacturer, who would they give it to: Ford? General Motors? Chrysler? They would be effectively picking winners and losers in the free market economy, something which the United States Government tries not to do. It is also not surprising that the United States would seek a more permissive regime when it comes to security related intelligence, because the United States is widely believed to have the most sophisticated offensive cyber arsenal on the planet.\nHowever, this push to bifurcate the rules – with one set of rules for economically motivated cyber espionage and one set for security related cyber espionage – sets up an interesting problem. The difficulty is that this framework would require target states to understand the motivation behind a particular intrusion in order to accurately gage the legality of that act. It also presupposes that a clear line can be drawn between economic and security interests – which of course is not true. Suppose for example that State A dropped a logic bomb on the central server of the national bank in State B. What if the purpose of this act was to activate the nefarious code only in the event of a kinetic conflict between the two states to undermine the economy within the target state? But, what if the purpose of the logic bomb was solely to undermine consumer confidence in that bank and to push consumer and business investments elsewhere? The act, placing nefarious code on the server, is the exact same. It is only the motivation that differs. And, in cyberspace, it will be difficult if not impossible to accurately assess the motivation behind any particular act. Therefore, the notion of setting up a dual regime with permissive rules for security related espionage and restrictive rules for economic espionage rests on top of two fallacies. First, that a target can tell the difference between acts that are economic in nature versus those that are security related, and that there is an actual difference between the two. And second, that a target will be able to ascertain why a particular clandestine cyber act was undertaken. This bifurcation of espionage related activities is simply not a sustainable way to create realistic rules of the road for espionage in cyber space.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809828",

  "flat_text": "# CYBER ESPIONAGE AND INTERNATIONAL LAW\n## BY AARON SHULL\n## INTRODUCTION\nThe place of espionage under international law is an uneasy one. Many look to state practice, and conclude that acts of espionage must surely be legal because so many states spy on one another. Others say that sending spies in to the territory of another state breaches the norm of territorial and sovereign integrity, and therefore acts of espionage should rightly be considered illegal pursuant to the relevant legal rules. The difficulty in assessing legality is amplified when analyzing cyber intrusions, because they do not offend the principle of territorial integrity in the same way that sending an actual state agent to gather human intelligence (colloquially referred to as “HUMINT”) would. This paper is an attempt to address these legal ambiguities.\nHowever, because there is no public multilateral treaty that addresses acts of cyber espionage, recourse must be made to the customary rules to determine the position of espionage under international law. At its most basic level, customary law is comprised of the rules that emerge as a matter of past practice amongst nation states, and which come to govern future relations between them. The Statute of the International Court of Justice defines customary law as “evidence of a general practice accepted as law.” This has been interpreted to mean that for a customary norm of conduct to crystallize into a binding rule – gaining formal status under international law – two constituent criteria must be met. First, there must be widespread and consistent state practice. Second, the activity in question, or the abstinence of states from engaging in a particular activity, must be done out of a sense of legal compulsion. This second element, called *opinio juris*, is used to differentiate state actions that are legally obliged from those undertaken for some other purpose (like self-interest or comity).\nThe starting point for the application of international rules is the often cited *Lotus* principle, which asserts that a sovereign state may undertake any action they wish, as long as that action is not explicitly prohibited. The relevant question then becomes: Is there an explicit prohibition on acts of cyber espionage? The research goal of this paper is to answer that question, and in answering this question the paper will make three arguments.\nFirst, that despite the fact that states routinely spy on each other, there is no evidence to support the proposition that state actors view cyber espionage as something that is legal under customary\n Geoffrey B. Demarest, *Espionage in International Law*, 24 DENV. J. INT'L L. &amp; POL'Y 321, 321 (1996); Glenn Sulmasy &amp; John Yoo, *Counterintuitive: Intelligence Operations and International Law*, 28 MICH.

A) No. 10, p. 28 (The Court distinguishes between cases that are binding as a matter of international law, and those which simply represent an ongoing non-obligatory form of conduct stating that “only if such abstention were based on their being conscious of having a duty to abstain would it be possible to speak of an international custom”).\nElectronic copy available at: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2809828\ninternational law. In this regard, while instances of cyber espionage may not offend the territorial integrity of the target state like human spying would, a sound legal conclusion can be drawn that certain intrusions will offend the principle of non-interference under international law. And, if cyber intrusions offend the principle of non-interference, they are correctly considered to be illegal pursuant to the relevant customary rules.\nSecond, the forces that influence the behavior of both state and non-state actors in relation to cyber espionage are much more complicated than a simple determination of legality. Cyber espionage may be illegal, but this vague notion of illegality pursuant to an even vaguer general rule of customary law acts as an extremely poor constraint on state behaviour. Poorly constrained, it is no surprise that states have engaged in a massive campaign of political, economic and military cyber espionage activities. However, many states view the current situation characterized by widespread (and largely unchecked) acts of cyber espionage as unsustainable. It is the explosion in the number of targets created by the Internet that has led the global community in to a process of what international relations scholars call ‘regime’ building, or what international lawyers call the ‘transnational legal process’. Simply put, the existing rules (both hard and soft) that govern behavior are evolving, and new rules are – or at the very least will be – emerging.\nThird, contemporary regime building efforts driven largely by the United States seem poised to build a bifurcated legal regime separating out economic espionage (aimed at private sector interests) from other more traditional forms (aimed largely at states). The most recent evidence of this came during high-level talks between the United States and China, when it became clear that the agenda of the United States was to establish restrictive prohibitions on economically oriented acts of cyber espionage alongside a more permissive regime for traditional security related espionage. After the first day of talks, an American official said in relation to the theft of intellectual property, “we don’t do it, and we don’t think any country should do it.” For its part, China does not see a comparable distinction between economic and military security. As an example, the China Daily – a government oriented publication – wrote that “by dividing cyberespionage into ‘bad’ and ‘good’ activities, Washington is trying to dictate the rules for global cyberdomain, which is a public space.” Thus, it seems clear that the normative ground is shifting. But given the divergent views among two of the main actors, it remains unclear how fast and how far these normative changes will go to actually curbing unwanted state behavior in cyber space.\nIn order to make these arguments, this paper will proceed as follows. Part I will set out the precise content of the norm of non-interference under international law. Part II will examine state practice and opinio juris in relation to cyber espionage through the lens of the 2010 clandestine entry into Google’s servers – termed operation Aurora – arguing that there is no opinio juris to support state practice and that, even when caught, states tend to deny responsibility for acts of cyber espionage. Part III examines the emerging trend toward a more robust regime, which seeks to place greater constraints on the commission of acts of cyber\n David E.

Finally, Part IV concludes with some recommendations regarding the potential course of evolution in this dynamic area of law.\n## PART I - THE NORM OF NON-INTERFERENCE UNDER INTERNATIONAL LAW AND CYBER ESPIONAGE\nAt its most basic level, the principle of non-interference provides, that “[n]o state has the right to intervene in the internal or external affairs of another.” This general statement of principle seems to elude precise quantification and the jurisprudence is largely unhelpful in determining with any level of specificity the content of the prohibition on foreign interference. The clearest articulation of the norm from the International Court of Justice is that the principle forbids intervention that has a “bearing on matters in which each State is permitted, by the principle of State sovereignty, to decide freely.” The utility of this observation is limited by the fact that the modern regulatory state is free to decide almost anything within its territory, and because there is a serious gap between what a broad view of the norm of non-interference would require and what states actually do in their conduct toward one another. For that reason, determining the content of the norm with precision will require a case-by-case analysis to determine whether the specific conduct in question - in this case cyber espionage - falls within the scope of the prohibition.\nThere have been two broadly supported United Nations General Assembly Resolutions that have some bearing on the scope of the principle. The first is the 1965 the Declaration on the Inadmissibility of Intervention in the Domestic Affairs of States and the Protection of their Independence and Sovereignty (“Declaration on Intervention”). The second is the 1970 Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States in Accordance with the Charter of the United Nations (“Friendly Relations Declaration”). These two documents are strikingly similar, with only modest differences. The relevant operative paragraph of the Friendly Relations Declaration is slightly more robust, stating:\nNo State or group of States has the right to intervene, directly or indirectly, for any reason whatever, in the internal or external affairs of any other State. Consequently, armed intervention and all other forms of interference or attempted threats against the personality of the State or against its political, economic and cultural elements, are in violation of international law.\nThus, within the Friendly Relations Declaration, which is widely regarded to reflect customary\nElectronic copy available at: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2809828\n\nlaw, there is an explicit prohibition on any form of interference with the political, economic and cultural elements of another state. However, the International Court of Justice narrowed this broad articulation in the Nicaragua decision, noting that:\nA prohibited intervention must accordingly be one bearing on matters in which each State is permitted, by the principle of State sovereignty, to decide freely. One of these is the choice of a political, economic, social and cultural system, and the formulation of foreign policy. Intervention is wrongful when it uses methods of coercion in regard to such choices, which must remain free ones.\nThe problem is that the Court does not go on to define with any level of specificity what the content of the prohibition on interference actually is. The Court indicates that in order to be prohibited under international law an intervention must be one bearing on matters that each State is permitted, by the principle of State sovereignty, to decide freely. Unfortunately, rather than clarifying this position, the Court – curiously – goes on to consider whether there is any customary international law allowing intervention. Thus, the actual content of the norm of non-interference is left ill-defined and extremely vague.\nThe Nicaragua decision is further limited by the fact that it is decided at that outset that the \"Court will define only those aspects of the principle which appear to be relevant to the resolution of the dispute.\" In this respect this case is lacking because, in many ways, the discussion of non-interference/non-intervention is subsumed within the larger discussion of the prohibition on the use of force that is the immediate subject matter of the decision. Therefore, the decision really provides only a partial discussion of the principle of non-interference. The Court explicitly chooses to discuss only those aspects of the principle relevant to the case before it. By definition then, the principle of non-interference goes beyond the narrow articulation presented by the Court. Consequently, states and legal scholars alike were left with only a partial explanation of the rule and with an unfinished legal test to determine which acts will actually offend the rule against foreign interference. What if any relevance does this limited test have for determining if a particular act of cyber espionage will offend the principle against non-interference? The simple answer is not much.\nPursuant to the test for interference posited in the Nicaragua case, in order to fall within the definition of prohibited intervention, the act in question must be intended to force or coerce a change of policy within the victim state. This formulation is not without support in the literature. Russell Buchan recently put forward a rote articulation of this test, in relation to cyber interference. Buchan argues:\nAll in all, in order to establish a violation of the non-intervention principle two questions must be addressed. First, is the intervention intended to force the victim State into a change of policy? [...] Secondly, if the intention to impose coercion is present, it must then be asked whether the application of coercion bears upon matters\n Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua (Nicar. v. U.S.), Judgment, 1986 I.C.J. 14, 202 (June 27) (“The principle of non-intervention involves the right of every sovereign State to conduct its affairs without outside interference; though examples of trespass against this principle are not infrequent, the Court considers that it is part and parcel of customary international law.”).\n Ibid., 205 (emphasis added).\n Ibid.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809828\nwhich a state is entitled to freely determine itself.\nThe problem is that adopting this legal standard would exclude from international regulation all acts of cyber aggression that had no physical (or kinetic) effect, and which were motived by something other than a desire to influence policy within the target state. As an example, in February of 2011 the Internet security firm, McAfee, uncovered a major network infiltration using IP addresses located in China. The intrusion, labeled “Night Dragon”, targeted Western oil and energy companies and “[t]he goal of the intrusions was to obtain information on sensitive competitive proprietary operations and on financing of oil and gas field bids and operations.” In this case, valuable proprietary information was stolen and a significant benefit would have accrued to the relevant Chinese agencies or firms. However, because the objective was to obtain sensitive information and to use it against Chinese competitors, according to the circumspect test of the International Court of Justice in Nicaragua or the analysis put forward by Buchan, this would not qualify as an unlawful intervention or interference. This is because the breach was not intended to change a policy within the victim state.\nThis notion is deeply problematic given that the gravamen of the offence of unlawful interference is intervening in to the sphere over which the target state has authority. States – acting in their capacity as a sovereign – have the ability to regulate telecommunications, Internet service providers, intellectual property rights, and criminal sanctions related to data breaches. The exercise of these rights has nothing to do with the intent of the offending party. Rather, the right itself flows from state sovereignty. It is the intervention within the affairs of a sovereign state that is offensive, regardless of the intent of the intervening party.\nHowever, given the limits of the applicable jurisprudence, all that can really be said about the status of the law is that it remains unclear and ill-suited to address clandestine cyber intrusions. The law is unclear because there is no authoritative decision that unequivocally demarcates the boundaries of an independent right of non-interference. The law is ill-suited to address cyber intrusions, because if a requisite element of the test of non-interference is the requirement to influence policy in the target state, then intrusions that are motivated by some other desire (i.e. economics) and which are meant to remain covert will rarely – if ever – meet this threshold. Employing a purposive (intent based) analysis to determine whether or not a covert cyber entry will offend the principle of non-interference is inappropriate because it sets up an impossible test – how can one ever know what the intention is behind a clandestine network entry?\n Russell Buchan, *Cyber Attacks: Unlawful Uses of Force or Prohibited Interventions?* 2 J. OF CONFLICT &amp; SEC. L. 211, 224-225.\n These would likely be governed under Article 2(4) of the United Nations Charter as a use of force. See Matthew C. Waxman, *Cyber-Attacks and the Use of Force: Back to the Future of Article 2(4)*, 36 YALE J. INT'L L. 421 (“there is considerable momentum among American scholars and policy experts behind the idea that some cyber-attacks ought to fall within Article 2(4)'s prohibition of \"force\" or could constitute an \"armed attack,\" at least insofar as those terms should be interpreted to cover attacks with features and consequences closely resembling conventional military attacks or kinetic force.”).\n See OFFICE OF THE NAT'L COUNTERINTELLIGENCE EXEC., *FOREIGN SPIES STEALING US ECONOMIC SECRETS IN CYBERSPACE: REPORT TO CONGRESS ON FOREIGN ECONOMIC COLLECTION AND INDUSTRIAL ESPIONAGE*, 2009-2011, 5 (2011) [COUNTERINTELLIGENCE REPORT].\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809828\nNotwithstanding these challenges, there is limited support within the literature for the proposition that acts of cyber espionage will offend the principle of non-interference. In this regard, Mary Ellen O'Connell writes:\nJust because a cyber-attack or cyber espionage do not amount to an armed attack does not mean that international law has no law against such wrongs. Interference with a State's economic sphere, air space, maritime space or territorial space, even if not prohibited by treaty is prohibited under the general principle of non-intervention. This is apparent in a number of treaties, UN resolutions and ICJ decisions that condemn coercion, interference or intervention that falls short of the use of force.\nEven with this limited scholarly support, the actual content of the norm against cyber interference remains amorphous. Surely the norm would not encompass every mild cyber incident, but it must still protect the customary norm that “every sovereign state [has a right] to conduct its affairs without outside interference.” By definition then, determining which cyber intrusions offend the principle of non-interference and which do not will be an exercise in legal line drawing. Suppose for example that State A plans to infiltrate a functioning nuclear power plant in State B. The purpose is to force B to change a foreign policy position. When B decides not to change its position, A activates previously placed nefarious code, or “logic bomb”, and causes a meltdown. This would offend both the prohibition on the use of force and easily offend the principle of non-interference. However, suppose B infiltrates the network of the company that makes the reactor to steal industrial designs, recognizing a major cost savings in the establishment of a domestic nuclear power industry. Would this offend the principle of non-interference? What if B just looks at the designs but does not use them for any purpose?\nThese examples demonstrate a clear need to rearticulate the test for prohibited interference in relation to cyber intrusions, moving away from a test that is based on the intent of the offending party to one based on the potential effect of the intrusion. The principle of non-interference is often said to be a corollary of the principle of state sovereignty. A corollary is something which is a “proposition that follows from a proven proposition with little or no additional proof; something that naturally flows.” In this way, the content of the norm of non-interference should naturally follow the contours of the principle of state sovereignty. Thus, if the intrusion\n Mary Ellen O'Connell, *Cyber Security without Cyber War*, 2 J. OF CONFLICT &amp; SEC.

This is a permissible interpretation of the rule, because as noted above, the International Court of Justice’s previous ruling on the issue dealt with only a narrow application of the norm and only to the extent that was necessary to deal with matters immediately before it in the Nicaragua case.\nIf one adopts this rearticulated effects based test, then covert entry into networks accompanied by the stealing of intellectual property, which undermines confidence in the Internet and telecommunications generally, threatens national security, or undermines the financial position or competiveness of domestic companies – and the corresponding revenue base of their governments – could potentially offend the principle of non-interference. This would necessarily be subject to the doctrine of de minimis non curat lex, or the idea that the law does not concern itself with trifles. Thus, in order to offend the principle, there should be some significant effect attached to the cyber intrusion. If, these criteria are met, then a reasonable reading of the principle of non-interference as articulated in Declaration on Intervention and the Friendly Relations Declaration, which are considered to be customary law, would recognize these events as prohibited.\nThe main anticipated critique to the conception of a norm of non-interference that that would prohibit these forms of cyber intrusions is that state practice diverges markedly from it. Universally, articles on the law of espionage rely on the fact that many states engage in espionage as a justification for its legality. The thrust of the response is that secret state practice is legally irrelevant. The fact that states hide their behavior reinforces the existence of a prohibition, but more importantly, there is strong authority for the proposition that secret state practice is a deficient and unsatisfactory marker in the establishment of a legal rule, or change in its content. According to the International Law Association’s Committee on Formation of Customary (General) International Law, a “secret physical act (e.g. secretly “bugging” diplomatic premises) is probably not an example of the objective element. And if the act is discovered, it probably does not count as State practice unless the State tries to assert that its conduct was legally justified.” The very notion of a rule of law presupposes that the rule be public. The United Nation Charter bans secret treaties, and the same logic would apply to a\n THE WHITE HOUSE, CYBERSPACE POLICY REVIEW, ASSURING A TRUSTED AND RESILIENT INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE (2009) available at http://www.whitehouse.gov/assets/documents/Cyberspace_Policy_Review_final.pdf (“Other intrusions threaten to damage portions of our critical infrastructure.

There is simply no compelling reason for secret state practice to change the rules of public international law.\n## PART II – CYBER ESPIONAGE AND STATE PRACTICE\nEvaluating state practice in relation to the collection of intelligence from human sources or through signals intercepts is difficult for obvious reasons, not least of which is the fact that these activities are meant to be clandestine. Evaluating the practice of states in relation to espionage committed via the Internet is more difficult still, because not only are the activities clandestine, but there are significant challenges with both technical and legal attribution, and even when breaches are uncovered, in many cases the victims are corporations – not states – and often times they do not report the breaches to their own government.\nTherefore, employing case study methodology has distinct advantages over generalizations regarding state practice in this area. However, owing to the furtive character of espionage, selecting an appropriate case for study presents its own challenges. The surreptitious infiltration into the Google network discovered in 2010, termed Operation Aurora, was selected for study not only because of its high level of publicity, but also because it provoked a rare public response from the two major governments involved, the United States and China.\nCertainly, there are disadvantages to employing case study methodology as well. More particularly, employing a single case study fails to account for the fact that many governments routinely engage in acts of economic espionage aimed squarely at private actors within competitor states. It is also requires generalization from one particular case, involving two state actors, to the wider groups of states. This has significant drawbacks because states do not behave in a uniform fashion, they are not motivated or constrained by the same things, and may take a differing view of a particular act. It is also impossible to ever truly know what is motivating a state to undertake a particular course of action. The fact is that generalizing from one observation is a poor mechanism for understanding the motivations of state behavior in a wider context. However, undertaking a detailed case study analysis of the actual conduct of an\nMedia of Rules, 13 GERMAN L.J. 1508, 1518 (“Following the disastrous experience with secret treaties in the lead up to World War I, and responding to demands for transparency from citizens as democracy expanded, states agreed to prohibit secret treaties in international law.

Nation states and criminals target our government and private sector information networks to gain competitive advantage in the commercial sector.”).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809828\ninfiltration that has been publicly exposed is valuable, notwithstanding its drawbacks. The rare public glimpse into the otherwise murky world of international espionage provides valuable evidence for the evaluation of both state practice and opinio juris regarding these actions.\nWhen evaluating the significance of state practice in relation to customary legal rules and espionage, it is a mistake simply to evaluate the conduct of the state that has engaged in the offensive operations. Rather, when operations are uncovered, the response of the offended government is just as, if not more important. Thus, the Google infiltration provides an uncommon example, where a major corporation publicly disclosed the infiltration first, forcing the governments of both states to respond. For that reason, this section will evaluate not only the conduct attributed to the Chinese government in relation to the infiltration of Google and Operation Aurora, but also the response of the United States Government.\n## 1. The Aurora Exploit\nOn January 12, 2010, David Drummond, Senior Vice-President and Chief Legal Officer of Google publicly disclosed that his company had fallen victim to a major network infiltration. Drummond indicated on the company's official blog, that Google had “detected a highly sophisticated and targeted attack on our corporate infrastructure originating from China that resulted in the theft of intellectual property from Google.” During their internal investigations into the infiltration, the company determined that at least twenty other large companies in the Internet, finance, technology, media and chemical sectors were also targeted. They also uncovered evidence to suggest that “a primary goal of the attackers was accessing the Gmail accounts of Chinese human rights activists.”\nAccording to subsequent investigations undertaken by the Internet security firm, McAfee, Operation Aurora initially targeted an individual user within Google. This individual would then receive a link in either an email or through an instant message that purported to be from a trusted source. Once the targeted user clicked on the link at their computer, they would be directed to a website hosted on servers in Taiwan that contained a malicious JavaScript payload. Once at the nefarious website, the Internet browser program being used to view the website automatically downloaded and executed the malicious program code, which included a zero-day Internet Explorer exploit. The exploit then executed the malicious payload, which set up a backdoor and the networked computer of the unsuspecting user was then remotely connected to command\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809828\n David Drummond, *A new approach to China*, GOOGLE: OFFICIAL BLOG (Jan. 12, 2010) http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/01/new-approach-to-china.html\n David Drummond, *A new approach to China*, GOOGLE: OFFICIAL BLOG (Jan. 12, 2010) http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/01/new-approach-to-china.html\n In basic terms, JavaScript is computer-coding language employed in numerous popular applications including websites and PDFs.\n A zero-day exploit is the term of art among software developers and hackers that refers to a previously unknown vulnerability in a computer application. The use of the term zero-day, is meant to connote that the first attack on the software takes place on “day zero” of vulnerability awareness on the part of the software developer. It also means that the software developers have had zero days to develop a software “patch” that addresses the vulnerability in question.\n When attempting to remotely access a computer there is typically an authentication process, which ensures that the party seeking access is entitled to that access.

Once connected to these command servers the “attackers had complete access to internal systems. They targeted sources of intellectual property, including software configuration management (SCM) systems accessible by the compromised system.”\nThe methods employed during the exploit seem clear. However, actually attributing that covert network exploitation back to the Chinese Government is a different story. In this respect, one report prepared for the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission by Northrop Grumman Corp stated that:\nThe publicly disclosed evidence linking Chinese state sponsorship to the Google intrusion is compelling but still largely circumstantial. Analysis of the malware by third party specialists identified only a small component of the overall code that clearly had a Chinese pedigree; the information targeted was both Google source code and email accounts reportedly of Chinese human rights activists, suggesting a political as well as economic motivation. The IP addresses for the C2 nodes discovered during the forensic investigation were attributed to a Chinese college that has been linked in the past to alleged state sponsored network exploitation activity.\nHowever, in a leaked classified cable from the United States Embassy in Beijing, the United States government was informed that “[a] well-placed contact claims that the Chinese government coordinated the recent intrusions of Google systems. According to our contact, the closely held operations were directed at the Politburo Standing Committee level.” While according to the same cable, “Another contact claimed a top PRC leader was actively working with Google competitor Baidu against Google.” In the world of intelligence gathering, there are few certainties; but this cable is close. Although undated, it seems clear that the United States Government was advised shortly after Operation Aurora, and in no uncertain terms, that the infiltration was directed at the Politburo Standing Committee level. The Politburo Standing Committee consists of the top leadership of the Communist Party of China and is the most powerful decision-making body of the Chinese Government.\n## 2. The Response of the United States Government\nThe response of the United States Government was confusing and watered down. It was confusing because it did not reflect the reality of what the United States Government knew had taken place. It was watered down, because the response morphed over time, from what looked like a strong protest, to a situation where the State Department would not even use the word *demarche* to classify their response toward the Chinese Government.\n MCAFEE LABS AND MCAFEE FOUNDSTONE PROFESSIONAL SERVICES, PROTECTING YOUR CRITICAL ASSETS: LESSONS LEARNED FROM “OPERATION AURORA”, available at http://www.mcafee.com/us/resources/white-papers/wp-protecting-critical-assets.pdf.\n BRYAN KREKEL, PATTON ADAMS &amp; GEORGE BAKOS, OCCUPYING THE INFORMATION HIGH GROUND: CHINESE CAPABILITIES FOR COMPUTER NETWORK OPERATIONS AND CYBER ESPIONAGE 99, Prepared for the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission by Northrop Grumman Corp. (March 7, 2012).\n The New York Times, State’s Secrets: A Selection From the Cache of Diplomatic Dispatches, http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2010/11/28/world/20101128-cables-viewer.html#report/china-99BEIJING999.\n Ibid.\n See U.S. Department of State Foreign Affairs Manual Volume 7 – Consular Affairs, at http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/86558.pdf (“A demarche is a formal diplomatic representation of one government’s official position, views, or wishes on a given subject to an appropriate official in another government\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809828\nOn the same day that Google publicly announced that they had been the victim of a network infiltration, Secretary of State Clinton noted that the State Department had been briefed by Google regarding the allegations, which raised “very serious concerns and questions. We look to the Chinese government for an explanation.”41 Then, merely one day later, Assistant Secretary of State, Phillip Crowley, in response to a question on the Google infiltration stated that: “I wouldn’t say that this is necessarily different than the range of issues that we continue to work on with China.”42 Thus, the official response morphed in less than 24 hours, from one of serious concern regarding the covert infiltration of Google, to one in which this issue was no different, or more important, then the other issues involved in the bilateral relations between the two states.\nThe tone changed again the following day. During the January 14, 2010, press briefing Assistant Secretary of State Crowley stated that “this is – it’s a serious issue on a number of levels. As we have talked about, there are business standards and expectations, international norms that you expect your business partners to live up to. And we have had multiple conversations with China about activity both in this area and more broadly.”43 He then went on to state that: “We [the United States Government] have raised this issue today in saying that we have serious concerns about this and its ramifications.”44\nThen on January 15, 2010, the United States Government decided to issue a diplomatic demarche. During the press briefing, Assistant Secretary of State Crowley stated that: “We will be issuing a formal demarche to the Chinese Government in Beijing on this issue in the coming days, probably early next week. [It] will express our concern for this incident and request information from China as to an explanation of how it happened and what they plan to do about it.”45 Notwithstanding this unambiguous statement regarding the issuance of a demarche, it is important to note that a demarche is simply formal diplomatic representation of a government’s official position. They can be used as a mechanism to protest or object to actions by a foreign government, but do not necessarily imply the illegality of those actions. Certainly a government may use a demarche to register its position that a certain act undertaken by a foreign government contravened international law, but this will depend entirely on the wording of the document.\nStill, there was a significant softening of this position on January 19, 2010. On that day during the press briefing, Assistant Secretary of State Kurt M. Campbell was asked “whether that\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809828\ndemarche has been formally issued over the Google case\".46 Campbell responded that the United States Government has had \"multiple meetings with Chinese authorities\" that they \"take this matter very seriously\" and that \"the whole issue does raise serious concerns.\"47 The language of using a diplomatic demarche had disappeared from the parlance of the State Department; instead now the United States Government was content to ask \"them [the Government of China] for an explanation.\"48 Later that day in a separate briefing, Assistant Secretary of State Crowley was asked \"has that demarche been issued and can you tell us what it says?\". The response was terse: \"Kurt [Assistant Secretary of State Campbell] made clear that he had – he said what he said. I'm not going to go further.\"49\nOn January 21, 2010, Secretary of State Clinton spoke on Internet freedom, and during those remarks, she commented that the \"recent situation involving Google has attracted a great deal of interest. And we look to the Chinese authorities to conduct a thorough review of the cyber intrusions that led Google to make its announcement. And we also look for that investigation and its results to be transparent.\"50 The Secretary made no mention of a demarche or other formal rebuke.\nThen on January 22, 2010 the Washington Post reported that a demarche had already been issued, \"according to a State Department official\".51 However, any ambiguity regarding the issuance of the demarche was removed on January 22, 2010, when Assistant Secretary of State Crowley was pointedly asked \"Did you or did you not issue a demarche?\", his response: \"No. Not yet.\"52 Then on February 19, 2010, Crowley was questioned again about the United States formal diplomatic response to the covert infiltration of Google's network. The question: \"I was just wondering - going back to that Goggle [sic] case, there was the discussion that the U.S. is trying to lodge a formal complaint - a demarche on Goggle [sic]. I'm wondering if that has happened or hasn't, and if not, why not?\" The response:\nMR. CROWLEY: Well, I think the – we have had multiple conversations with Chinese officials on this issue, and that included a direct conversation between Secretary Clinton and Foreign Minister Yang in London late last month. So I think we have satisfied ourselves that the Chinese understand the importance with which we view this issue. We have called on the Chinese to conduct a thorough review of cyber intrusions. And they are obviously in the best\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809828\nposition to evaluate what has and continues to occur within their borders.\nQUESTION: So – but just to follow on that, I mean, if the U.S. Government says it's going to make a formal demarche, then it doesn't, does that mean that there's been a change in the assessment of the situation on the ground?\nMR. CROWLEY: Well, I mean, if – a demarche can be a written statement. It can be a verbal statement. The Secretary directly engaged Foreign Minister Yang on this issue. So if you want to call that a demarche – I think we have done what we set out to do, which is to directly express our concerns at high levels about this activity and to encourage China to investigate it thoroughly.53\nIt seems plain that the position of the United States Government morphs over time. The position fluctuates from a issuing a formal demarche to the Chinese Government in Beijing, which expressed serious concern, to a position where the State Department was unwilling to refer to their actions in those terms, referring instead to “high level talks” and “engagement”. The final softening of the United States’ response came several months after the initial announcement by Google.\nOn March 19, 2010 Secretary of State Clinton was asked: “What has the Chinese Government told you about their investigation? What kind of pressure are you putting on the Chinese Government?”. The response from the Secretary of State was: “Well, specifically, with respect to Google, this is really between Google and China.”54 There was no indication that there was any formal response from the Chinese government related to an investigation or any hint that the Chinese Government had shared a plan to interdict these types of infiltrations.\nFor its part, the United States Congress had a less equivocal response. Senate Resolution 405 was introduced on February 2, 2010. It stated that the Senate: “Condemns the cyber attacks allegedly launched from China against Google and other companies and calls on the government of China to review such cyber intrusions.”55 The Resolution was co-sponsored by senior senators from both parties including Senators McCain, Lieberman, Specter and Feingold. It was considered, and agreed to without amendment and with a preamble by Unanimous Consent.56 The Preamble states, “this attack was one in a series of attempts to exploit security flaws and illegally access computer networks of individuals and institutions through the clandestine installation of phishing and malware technology.”57 Senator Kaufman rose two days later, and said on the Senate Floor, that “[w]ith the passage of this resolution, countries from which such attacks originate or countries which take steps to restrict or monitor the Internet should consider themselves on notice.”58 It is not clear what that notice would say, given the rather weak public response from the State Department and the Executive Branch.\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809828\nAnother branch of the United States Government also got involved in the response. It was widely reported that the National Security Agency, the cryptologic branch of the Department of Defense, entered into a secret agreement with Google after the intrusion. However, the NSA has never officially acknowledged a collaborative relationship with Google, and a recent United States Court of Appeals, District of Columbia Circuit Court decision, has made it clear that no information regarding any alleged agreement will be forthcoming and such an agreement, if it does exist, is exempt from freedom of information laws.^[59]^\n## 3. The Response of the Government of the People's Republic of China\nThe Chinese Government responded forcefully to the accusations made by both Google and the United States Government. In almost perfect Orwellian double-speak, the spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry indicated, in response that: \"It is China's consistent policy to promote the development of internet. China has its own national conditions and cultural traditions. It supervises internet according to law, which is in parallel with the international practice [sic].\"^[60]^ She went on to say that \"Hacking in whatever form and offence of others' privacy is prohibited by law in China. As a major victim of hacking in the world, China believes that the international community should intensify the cooperaion [sic] in jointly combating internet hacking so as to safeguard internet security and protect the privacy of citizens in accordance with law.\"^[61]^ So, the official position of the Government of China was that they were in no way responsible for the clandestine infiltration of Google's networks, and that the acts in question are considered criminal under Chinese domestic law.\nWhen confronted, China fervently denied having any role in the infiltration of Google's network. What makes this denial such meaningful evidence is that the United States Government - and the public through wikileaks - knew that the Chinese Government coordinated the intrusions of Google's systems and that the operation was directed at the Politburo Standing Committee level.^[62]^ While the public protest of the United States Government was weak and somewhat confusing, it certainly would not count as acquiescence toward the practice. However, in the face of this protest the Chinese Government did not seek to justify its conduct using legal argument or by relying on an existing or emerging customary legal rule. Rather, the Chinese Government completely denied the allegations. In fact, in their public response the Chinese Government pushes for more intense international cooperation to combat these occurrences.\nPut another way, there is no evidence of opinio juris surrounding the conduct of the states that engage in acts of economic cyber espionage or in the actions of the states that are victim. There has never been a public case of a state seeking to justify acts of cyber espionage as something that is defensible pursuant to international law. States do not feel compelled as a matter of legal obligation to engage in these acts, nor do states feel compelled to remain silent or acquiesce\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809828\nwhen they fall victim. There is no rule of customary international law that justifies a breach of the principle of non-interference, because there is absolutely no *opinio juris* to support what is – in all reality – a thriving clandestine state practice. And while the response of the United States Government was weaker than one might have expected, the fact is that it was a long way from passive acquiescence toward the conduct.\n## PART III - TRANSNATIONAL LEGALISM AND CYBER GOVERNANCE\nAs the above example shows, the international governance regime surrounding cyber espionage is still in its infancy. As such, simply determining whether these actions are legal or illegal is not enough. Rather, the legal rules and the norms that govern conduct in cyber space are in a period of flux and evolution. In order to understand these changes, one must understand the process of transnational legal evolution. The “[t]ransnational legal process describes the theory and practice of how public and private actors -- nation-states, international organizations, multinational enterprises, non-governmental organizations, and private individuals -- interact in a variety of public and private, domestic and international fora to make, interpret, enforce, and ultimately, internalize rules of transnational law.”63\nIn this way, the lens of transnational legalism provides several distinct advantages over the more traditional binary legal/illegal analysis noted above. It describes the complex and dynamic connection between the formation of norms within the international community and the reception and interpretation of those norms into domestic law and practice, while also providing an account of the influence of domestic norms on the development of international rules. It allows for a better and more complete understanding of the role of non-state actors, which are increasingly central players within the international community; moving away from the strictures of the traditional state centric analytical framework allows for a more holistic understanding of global affairs and has significantly greater descriptive validity – because it can accurately account for the fast moving and multi-faceted transnational interactions in the realm of cyber security generally and cyber espionage.\nIn transnational practice, “repeated interactions among states and a variety of domestic and transnational actors produce interpretations of applicable global norms which can be and are eventually internalized into states’ domestic values and processes.”64 Under transnational legal theory, “various agents of internalization – which include transnational norm entrepreneurs, governmental norm sponsors, transnational issue networks, issue linkages and interpretive communities – can provoke nations to move from grudging compliance to habitual internalized obedience with international rules.”65 Given the foregoing, the value of this theoretical model does not stop at its descriptive validity; rather, it has “both predictive capacity and explanatory\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809828\npower regarding questions of causation.\"66 Transnational legal theory predicts that nations are most likely to comply with international norms if transnational legal processes are “aggressively triggered by other transnational actors in a way that forces interaction in forums capable of generating norms, followed by norm-internalization.”67 This process of “interaction and internalization in turn leads a national government to engage in new modes of interest-recognition and identity-formation in a way that eventually leads the nation-state back into compliance.”68\nWhile it is appropriate to conclude that certain acts of cyber espionage are illegal as a matter of international law, and that there is no countervailing customary norm that provides a legal excuse or justification, it is equally appropriate to conclude that the raging practice of cyber espionage among states means that many have yet to subscribe to the norm and to internalize it in their conduct. Thus, with respect to cyber espionage, the global community is engaged at the earlier stages of the transnational legal process of repeated interaction and interpretation. This ongoing process is further complicated by the fact that there are competing norms being advanced by major actors with conflicting geostrategic interests.\nRecent treaty negotiations aimed at Internet regulation broke down over divergent views over the role of the state in international Internet governance.69 The fault line between the United States and Europe, on the one hand, and a coalition of states led by Russia and China, on the other, has also been exposed in relation to the international norms applicable to information security. In September 2011, the Governments of China, the Russian Federation, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan sent a draft International Code of Conduct for information security to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General.\nUnder the terms of the Code of Conduct, each state voluntarily subscribing to the code pledges: “Not to use information and communications technologies, including networks, to carry out hostile activities or acts of aggression, pose threats to international peace and security”.70 At first blush, by sponsoring the Code of Conduct, it would appear that the Governments of China and Russia are prepared to voluntarily pledge not to use information and communications technologies to carry out hostile activities. Given that states now view network integrity as fundamental to their national security, covert network infiltration and economic cyber espionage is unquestionably a hostile act. Therefore, under the Code of Conduct, Russia and China are prepared to disavow the legitimacy of cyber espionage as a tool of strategic and economic policy. This, however, is completely disingenuous.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809828\nThe fact is that both Russia and China are most persistent collectors of economic intelligence. According to a recent report from the Office of the National Counter Intelligence Executive, “Chinese actors are the world’s most active and persistent perpetrators of economic espionage. US private sector firms and cybersecurity specialists have reported an onslaught of computer network intrusions that have originated in China”.71 While at the same time “Russia’s intelligence services are conducting a range of activities to collect economic information and technology from US targets.”72\nThere are two main reasons that China and Russia engage in such aggressive economic cyber espionage, while at the same time they articulate a norm against it on the international stage. First, as a matter of geostrategic interest, “China and Russia view themselves as strategic competitors of the United States and are the most aggressive collectors of US economic information and technology.”73 Second, as a technical matter, these types of intrusions rarely get detected, and when they do they are notoriously difficult to attribute back to a state actor. As a consequence, Russia and China can act in a way that directly contradicts the norm that they are espousing, because there is a relatively low risk of discovery and attribution. It is not in their immediate interests to comply with that norm – the rewards are too high and the risks too low.\nAt the same time, countries like the United States and the United Kingdom are genuinely advocating for the establishment of, and reliance on, a comparable normative framework. Given the position of the United States as a global leader in intellectual property generation, it is not surprising that they would seek the enablement of a rules based regime that aims to hold the perpetrators of acts economic cyber espionage accountable for those actions. The most clear articulation of the policy of the United States Government toward acts of international economic cyber espionage is found in the May 2011 International Strategy for Cyber Space, signed by President Barack Obama. The International Strategy indicates:\nThe persistent theft of intellectual property, whether by criminals, foreign firms, or state actors working on their behalf, can erode competitiveness in the global economy, and businesses’ opportunities to innovate. The United States will take measures to identify and respond to such actions to help build an international environment that recognizes such acts as unlawful and impermissible, and hold such actors accountable.74\nGiven the foregoing it is not clear whether it is the position of the United States Government that the theft of intellectual property by state actors is currently recognized by the United States government as illegal, pursuant to international law, and that they are working to build on that within the international community. Or, if the United States Government will view this conduct as unlawful (pursuant to international law) once it has been accepted in the “international\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809828\nenvironment”. But, it is clear that it is not in either the short or long-term interests of the United States Government, or any similarly situated government, to allow economic cyber espionage to continue, constrained only by the vague notions of illegality provided by customary law. Because the United States does not spy for its domestic companies,75 it has no ability to engage in tit-for-tat diplomacy; meaning in response to the infiltration of Google’s network, there is no incentive for the United States to undertake a comparable infiltration of Baidu - the dominant Chinese search engine. It is, however, perfectly rational against this factual backdrop, for the United States to seek to advance a normative construct of illegality to constrain the behavior of other state actors. Thus, pushing for a clearer set of norms acts as one tool to attempt to influence the unwanted behaviors of other states.76\nIn this way, traditional notions of customary law or the internationalization of general principles do not adequately describe the contemporary governance mechanisms in place that address cyber espionage. Rather, the governance landscape is comprised of emerging norms of conduct, supported by major international actors, that are pursuing their interests and seeking to constrain the ability of other states to exploit the intellectual property and confidential information of the companies that operate in their territory or are regulated by them. At the same time, many states engage in covert network infiltrations into the networks of companies located in their competitor states for economic, as well as political, reasons. When these activities are exposed, states are careful to distance themselves from the conduct. As noted, this suggests that there is no opinio juris supporting the conduct, that it offends the principle of non-interference, and that there is no competing legal rule changing that. But the story does not stop there.\nAt the international level, states like the United States are pushing to have an explicit norm recognized within the international community that prohibits economic cyber espionage, rather than subsisting on the implied norm against it that comes as part of the principle of non-interference. At the domestic level the majority of states already prohibit the types of network intrusions, data interference and intercepts that form the tools of the cyber espionage trade. But, more importantly, these states also – in some instances – seek to prohibit this conduct extraterritoriality and they do so with a legitimate basis under international law. All of this creates a unique legal position for economic cyber espionage: it is implicitly prohibited under customary international law, with a normative push to make it explicitly prohibited, all while states use municipal law to prohibit the conduct domestically and transnationally. Layered on top of this is the trend toward allowing a more permissive regime for national security and non-economic related acts of cyber espionage.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809828\n# PART IV – CONCLUSIONS\nAt this point in time, it is not entirely clear how the legal rules or norms of conduct will develop within this policy space. It is not surprising that the United States is pushing to create a strong normative and legal framework prohibiting acts of economic cyber espionage, because they have the most to lose and the least to gain from these types of activities. The United States generates major amounts of intellectual property and its firms routinely rely on sensitive and proprietary information in their business practices. At the same time, there is no ability within the United States’ system to translate stolen economic intelligence into an actionable intelligence product, because the United States does not have the ability to convey this stolen information to its domestic companies. After all, if the NSA were to steal the design for a revolutionary hybrid automotive engine from an Asian or European auto manufacturer, who would they give it to: Ford? General Motors? Chrysler? They would be effectively picking winners and losers in the free market economy, something which the United States Government tries not to do. It is also not surprising that the United States would seek a more permissive regime when it comes to security related intelligence, because the United States is widely believed to have the most sophisticated offensive cyber arsenal on the planet.\nHowever, this push to bifurcate the rules – with one set of rules for economically motivated cyber espionage and one set for security related cyber espionage – sets up an interesting problem. The difficulty is that this framework would require target states to understand the motivation behind a particular intrusion in order to accurately gage the legality of that act. It also presupposes that a clear line can be drawn between economic and security interests – which of course is not true. Suppose for example that State A dropped a logic bomb on the central server of the national bank in State B. What if the purpose of this act was to activate the nefarious code only in the event of a kinetic conflict between the two states to undermine the economy within the target state? But, what if the purpose of the logic bomb was solely to undermine consumer confidence in that bank and to push consumer and business investments elsewhere? The act, placing nefarious code on the server, is the exact same. It is only the motivation that differs. And, in cyberspace, it will be difficult if not impossible to accurately assess the motivation behind any particular act. Therefore, the notion of setting up a dual regime with permissive rules for security related espionage and restrictive rules for economic espionage rests on top of two fallacies. First, that a target can tell the difference between acts that are economic in nature versus those that are security related, and that there is an actual difference between the two. And second, that a target will be able to ascertain why a particular clandestine cyber act was undertaken. This bifurcation of espionage related activities is simply not a sustainable way to create realistic rules of the road for espionage in cyber space.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809828",

    "flat_text": "# CYBER ESPIONAGE AND INTERNATIONAL LAW\n## BY AARON SHULL\n## INTRODUCTION\nThe place of espionage under international law is an uneasy one. Many look to state practice, and conclude that acts of espionage must surely be legal because so many states spy on one another. Others say that sending spies in to the territory of another state breaches the norm of territorial and sovereign integrity, and therefore acts of espionage should rightly be considered illegal pursuant to the relevant legal rules. The difficulty in assessing legality is amplified when analyzing cyber intrusions, because they do not offend the principle of territorial integrity in the same way that sending an actual state agent to gather human intelligence (colloquially referred to as “HUMINT”) would. This paper is an attempt to address these legal ambiguities.\nHowever, because there is no public multilateral treaty that addresses acts of cyber espionage, recourse must be made to the customary rules to determine the position of espionage under international law. At its most basic level, customary law is comprised of the rules that emerge as a matter of past practice amongst nation states, and which come to govern future relations between them. The Statute of the International Court of Justice defines customary law as “evidence of a general practice accepted as law.” This has been interpreted to mean that for a customary norm of conduct to crystallize into a binding rule – gaining formal status under international law – two constituent criteria must be met. First, there must be widespread and consistent state practice. Second, the activity in question, or the abstinence of states from engaging in a particular activity, must be done out of a sense of legal compulsion. This second element, called *opinio juris*, is used to differentiate state actions that are legally obliged from those undertaken for some other purpose (like self-interest or comity).\nThe starting point for the application of international rules is the often cited *Lotus* principle, which asserts that a sovereign state may undertake any action they wish, as long as that action is not explicitly prohibited. The relevant question then becomes: Is there an explicit prohibition on acts of cyber espionage? The research goal of this paper is to answer that question, and in answering this question the paper will make three arguments.\nFirst, that despite the fact that states routinely spy on each other, there is no evidence to support the proposition that state actors view cyber espionage as something that is legal under customary\n Geoffrey B. Demarest, *Espionage in International Law*, 24 DENV. J. INT'L L. &amp; POL'Y 321, 321 (1996); Glenn Sulmasy &amp; John Yoo, *Counterintuitive: Intelligence Operations and International Law*, 28 MICH.

REV. 65, 79-80 (1964); Ingrid Delupis, *Foreign Warships and Immunity for Espionage*, 78 AM. J. INT'L L. 53, 67 (1984).\n See S.S. \"Lotus\" (Fr. v. Turk.), 1927 P.C.I.J. (ser. A) No. 10, p. 28 (The Court distinguishes between cases that are binding as a matter of international law, and those which simply represent an ongoing non-obligatory form of conduct stating that “only if such abstention were based on their being conscious of having a duty to abstain would it be possible to speak of an international custom”).\nElectronic copy available at: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2809828\ninternational law. In this regard, while instances of cyber espionage may not offend the territorial integrity of the target state like human spying would, a sound legal conclusion can be drawn that certain intrusions will offend the principle of non-interference under international law. And, if cyber intrusions offend the principle of non-interference, they are correctly considered to be illegal pursuant to the relevant customary rules.\nSecond, the forces that influence the behavior of both state and non-state actors in relation to cyber espionage are much more complicated than a simple determination of legality. Cyber espionage may be illegal, but this vague notion of illegality pursuant to an even vaguer general rule of customary law acts as an extremely poor constraint on state behaviour. Poorly constrained, it is no surprise that states have engaged in a massive campaign of political, economic and military cyber espionage activities. However, many states view the current situation characterized by widespread (and largely unchecked) acts of cyber espionage as unsustainable. It is the explosion in the number of targets created by the Internet that has led the global community in to a process of what international relations scholars call ‘regime’ building, or what international lawyers call the ‘transnational legal process’. Simply put, the existing rules (both hard and soft) that govern behavior are evolving, and new rules are – or at the very least will be – emerging.\nThird, contemporary regime building efforts driven largely by the United States seem poised to build a bifurcated legal regime separating out economic espionage (aimed at private sector interests) from other more traditional forms (aimed largely at states). The most recent evidence of this came during high-level talks between the United States and China, when it became clear that the agenda of the United States was to establish restrictive prohibitions on economically oriented acts of cyber espionage alongside a more permissive regime for traditional security related espionage. After the first day of talks, an American official said in relation to the theft of intellectual property, “we don’t do it, and we don’t think any country should do it.” For its part, China does not see a comparable distinction between economic and military security. As an example, the China Daily – a government oriented publication – wrote that “by dividing cyberespionage into ‘bad’ and ‘good’ activities, Washington is trying to dictate the rules for global cyberdomain, which is a public space.” Thus, it seems clear that the normative ground is shifting. But given the divergent views among two of the main actors, it remains unclear how fast and how far these normative changes will go to actually curbing unwanted state behavior in cyber space.\nIn order to make these arguments, this paper will proceed as follows. Part I will set out the precise content of the norm of non-interference under international law. Part II will examine state practice and opinio juris in relation to cyber espionage through the lens of the 2010 clandestine entry into Google’s servers – termed operation Aurora – arguing that there is no opinio juris to support state practice and that, even when caught, states tend to deny responsibility for acts of cyber espionage. Part III examines the emerging trend toward a more robust regime, which seeks to place greater constraints on the commission of acts of cyber\n David E.

Finally, Part IV concludes with some recommendations regarding the potential course of evolution in this dynamic area of law.\n## PART I - THE NORM OF NON-INTERFERENCE UNDER INTERNATIONAL LAW AND CYBER ESPIONAGE\nAt its most basic level, the principle of non-interference provides, that “[n]o state has the right to intervene in the internal or external affairs of another.” This general statement of principle seems to elude precise quantification and the jurisprudence is largely unhelpful in determining with any level of specificity the content of the prohibition on foreign interference. The clearest articulation of the norm from the International Court of Justice is that the principle forbids intervention that has a “bearing on matters in which each State is permitted, by the principle of State sovereignty, to decide freely.” The utility of this observation is limited by the fact that the modern regulatory state is free to decide almost anything within its territory, and because there is a serious gap between what a broad view of the norm of non-interference would require and what states actually do in their conduct toward one another. For that reason, determining the content of the norm with precision will require a case-by-case analysis to determine whether the specific conduct in question - in this case cyber espionage - falls within the scope of the prohibition.\nThere have been two broadly supported United Nations General Assembly Resolutions that have some bearing on the scope of the principle. The first is the 1965 the Declaration on the Inadmissibility of Intervention in the Domestic Affairs of States and the Protection of their Independence and Sovereignty (“Declaration on Intervention”). The second is the 1970 Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States in Accordance with the Charter of the United Nations (“Friendly Relations Declaration”). These two documents are strikingly similar, with only modest differences. The relevant operative paragraph of the Friendly Relations Declaration is slightly more robust, stating:\nNo State or group of States has the right to intervene, directly or indirectly, for any reason whatever, in the internal or external affairs of any other State. Consequently, armed intervention and all other forms of interference or attempted threats against the personality of the State or against its political, economic and cultural elements, are in violation of international law.\nThus, within the Friendly Relations Declaration, which is widely regarded to reflect customary\nElectronic copy available at: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2809828\n\nlaw, there is an explicit prohibition on any form of interference with the political, economic and cultural elements of another state. However, the International Court of Justice narrowed this broad articulation in the Nicaragua decision, noting that:\nA prohibited intervention must accordingly be one bearing on matters in which each State is permitted, by the principle of State sovereignty, to decide freely. One of these is the choice of a political, economic, social and cultural system, and the formulation of foreign policy. Intervention is wrongful when it uses methods of coercion in regard to such choices, which must remain free ones.\nThe problem is that the Court does not go on to define with any level of specificity what the content of the prohibition on interference actually is. The Court indicates that in order to be prohibited under international law an intervention must be one bearing on matters that each State is permitted, by the principle of State sovereignty, to decide freely. Unfortunately, rather than clarifying this position, the Court – curiously – goes on to consider whether there is any customary international law allowing intervention. Thus, the actual content of the norm of non-interference is left ill-defined and extremely vague.\nThe Nicaragua decision is further limited by the fact that it is decided at that outset that the \"Court will define only those aspects of the principle which appear to be relevant to the resolution of the dispute.\" In this respect this case is lacking because, in many ways, the discussion of non-interference/non-intervention is subsumed within the larger discussion of the prohibition on the use of force that is the immediate subject matter of the decision. Therefore, the decision really provides only a partial discussion of the principle of non-interference. The Court explicitly chooses to discuss only those aspects of the principle relevant to the case before it. By definition then, the principle of non-interference goes beyond the narrow articulation presented by the Court. Consequently, states and legal scholars alike were left with only a partial explanation of the rule and with an unfinished legal test to determine which acts will actually offend the rule against foreign interference. What if any relevance does this limited test have for determining if a particular act of cyber espionage will offend the principle against non-interference? The simple answer is not much.\nPursuant to the test for interference posited in the Nicaragua case, in order to fall within the definition of prohibited intervention, the act in question must be intended to force or coerce a change of policy within the victim state. This formulation is not without support in the literature. Russell Buchan recently put forward a rote articulation of this test, in relation to cyber interference. Buchan argues:\nAll in all, in order to establish a violation of the non-intervention principle two questions must be addressed. First, is the intervention intended to force the victim State into a change of policy? [...] Secondly, if the intention to impose coercion is present, it must then be asked whether the application of coercion bears upon matters\n Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua (Nicar. v. U.S.), Judgment, 1986 I.C.J. 14, 202 (June 27) (“The principle of non-intervention involves the right of every sovereign State to conduct its affairs without outside interference; though examples of trespass against this principle are not infrequent, the Court considers that it is part and parcel of customary international law.”).\n Ibid., 205 (emphasis added).\n Ibid.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809828\nwhich a state is entitled to freely determine itself.\nThe problem is that adopting this legal standard would exclude from international regulation all acts of cyber aggression that had no physical (or kinetic) effect, and which were motived by something other than a desire to influence policy within the target state. As an example, in February of 2011 the Internet security firm, McAfee, uncovered a major network infiltration using IP addresses located in China. The intrusion, labeled “Night Dragon”, targeted Western oil and energy companies and “[t]he goal of the intrusions was to obtain information on sensitive competitive proprietary operations and on financing of oil and gas field bids and operations.” In this case, valuable proprietary information was stolen and a significant benefit would have accrued to the relevant Chinese agencies or firms. However, because the objective was to obtain sensitive information and to use it against Chinese competitors, according to the circumspect test of the International Court of Justice in Nicaragua or the analysis put forward by Buchan, this would not qualify as an unlawful intervention or interference. This is because the breach was not intended to change a policy within the victim state.\nThis notion is deeply problematic given that the gravamen of the offence of unlawful interference is intervening in to the sphere over which the target state has authority. States – acting in their capacity as a sovereign – have the ability to regulate telecommunications, Internet service providers, intellectual property rights, and criminal sanctions related to data breaches. The exercise of these rights has nothing to do with the intent of the offending party. Rather, the right itself flows from state sovereignty. It is the intervention within the affairs of a sovereign state that is offensive, regardless of the intent of the intervening party.\nHowever, given the limits of the applicable jurisprudence, all that can really be said about the status of the law is that it remains unclear and ill-suited to address clandestine cyber intrusions. The law is unclear because there is no authoritative decision that unequivocally demarcates the boundaries of an independent right of non-interference. The law is ill-suited to address cyber intrusions, because if a requisite element of the test of non-interference is the requirement to influence policy in the target state, then intrusions that are motivated by some other desire (i.e. economics) and which are meant to remain covert will rarely – if ever – meet this threshold. Employing a purposive (intent based) analysis to determine whether or not a covert cyber entry will offend the principle of non-interference is inappropriate because it sets up an impossible test – how can one ever know what the intention is behind a clandestine network entry?\n Russell Buchan, *Cyber Attacks: Unlawful Uses of Force or Prohibited Interventions?* 2 J. OF CONFLICT &amp; SEC. L. 211, 224-225.\n These would likely be governed under Article 2(4) of the United Nations Charter as a use of force. See Matthew C. Waxman, *Cyber-Attacks and the Use of Force: Back to the Future of Article 2(4)*, 36 YALE J. INT'L L. 421 (“there is considerable momentum among American scholars and policy experts behind the idea that some cyber-attacks ought to fall within Article 2(4)'s prohibition of \"force\" or could constitute an \"armed attack,\" at least insofar as those terms should be interpreted to cover attacks with features and consequences closely resembling conventional military attacks or kinetic force.”).\n See OFFICE OF THE NAT'L COUNTERINTELLIGENCE EXEC., *FOREIGN SPIES STEALING US ECONOMIC SECRETS IN CYBERSPACE: REPORT TO CONGRESS ON FOREIGN ECONOMIC COLLECTION AND INDUSTRIAL ESPIONAGE*, 2009-2011, 5 (2011) [COUNTERINTELLIGENCE REPORT].\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809828\nNotwithstanding these challenges, there is limited support within the literature for the proposition that acts of cyber espionage will offend the principle of non-interference. In this regard, Mary Ellen O'Connell writes:\nJust because a cyber-attack or cyber espionage do not amount to an armed attack does not mean that international law has no law against such wrongs. Interference with a State's economic sphere, air space, maritime space or territorial space, even if not prohibited by treaty is prohibited under the general principle of non-intervention. This is apparent in a number of treaties, UN resolutions and ICJ decisions that condemn coercion, interference or intervention that falls short of the use of force.\nEven with this limited scholarly support, the actual content of the norm against cyber interference remains amorphous. Surely the norm would not encompass every mild cyber incident, but it must still protect the customary norm that “every sovereign state [has a right] to conduct its affairs without outside interference.” By definition then, determining which cyber intrusions offend the principle of non-interference and which do not will be an exercise in legal line drawing. Suppose for example that State A plans to infiltrate a functioning nuclear power plant in State B. The purpose is to force B to change a foreign policy position. When B decides not to change its position, A activates previously placed nefarious code, or “logic bomb”, and causes a meltdown. This would offend both the prohibition on the use of force and easily offend the principle of non-interference. However, suppose B infiltrates the network of the company that makes the reactor to steal industrial designs, recognizing a major cost savings in the establishment of a domestic nuclear power industry. Would this offend the principle of non-interference? What if B just looks at the designs but does not use them for any purpose?\nThese examples demonstrate a clear need to rearticulate the test for prohibited interference in relation to cyber intrusions, moving away from a test that is based on the intent of the offending party to one based on the potential effect of the intrusion. The principle of non-interference is often said to be a corollary of the principle of state sovereignty. A corollary is something which is a “proposition that follows from a proven proposition with little or no additional proof; something that naturally flows.” In this way, the content of the norm of non-interference should naturally follow the contours of the principle of state sovereignty. Thus, if the intrusion\n Mary Ellen O'Connell, *Cyber Security without Cyber War*, 2 J. OF CONFLICT &amp; SEC.

This is a permissible interpretation of the rule, because as noted above, the International Court of Justice’s previous ruling on the issue dealt with only a narrow application of the norm and only to the extent that was necessary to deal with matters immediately before it in the Nicaragua case.\nIf one adopts this rearticulated effects based test, then covert entry into networks accompanied by the stealing of intellectual property, which undermines confidence in the Internet and telecommunications generally, threatens national security, or undermines the financial position or competiveness of domestic companies – and the corresponding revenue base of their governments – could potentially offend the principle of non-interference. This would necessarily be subject to the doctrine of de minimis non curat lex, or the idea that the law does not concern itself with trifles. Thus, in order to offend the principle, there should be some significant effect attached to the cyber intrusion. If, these criteria are met, then a reasonable reading of the principle of non-interference as articulated in Declaration on Intervention and the Friendly Relations Declaration, which are considered to be customary law, would recognize these events as prohibited.\nThe main anticipated critique to the conception of a norm of non-interference that that would prohibit these forms of cyber intrusions is that state practice diverges markedly from it. Universally, articles on the law of espionage rely on the fact that many states engage in espionage as a justification for its legality. The thrust of the response is that secret state practice is legally irrelevant. The fact that states hide their behavior reinforces the existence of a prohibition, but more importantly, there is strong authority for the proposition that secret state practice is a deficient and unsatisfactory marker in the establishment of a legal rule, or change in its content. According to the International Law Association’s Committee on Formation of Customary (General) International Law, a “secret physical act (e.g. secretly “bugging” diplomatic premises) is probably not an example of the objective element. And if the act is discovered, it probably does not count as State practice unless the State tries to assert that its conduct was legally justified.” The very notion of a rule of law presupposes that the rule be public. The United Nation Charter bans secret treaties, and the same logic would apply to a\n THE WHITE HOUSE, CYBERSPACE POLICY REVIEW, ASSURING A TRUSTED AND RESILIENT INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE (2009) available at http://www.whitehouse.gov/assets/documents/Cyberspace_Policy_Review_final.pdf (“Other intrusions threaten to damage portions of our critical infrastructure.

There is simply no compelling reason for secret state practice to change the rules of public international law.\n## PART II – CYBER ESPIONAGE AND STATE PRACTICE\nEvaluating state practice in relation to the collection of intelligence from human sources or through signals intercepts is difficult for obvious reasons, not least of which is the fact that these activities are meant to be clandestine. Evaluating the practice of states in relation to espionage committed via the Internet is more difficult still, because not only are the activities clandestine, but there are significant challenges with both technical and legal attribution, and even when breaches are uncovered, in many cases the victims are corporations – not states – and often times they do not report the breaches to their own government.\nTherefore, employing case study methodology has distinct advantages over generalizations regarding state practice in this area. However, owing to the furtive character of espionage, selecting an appropriate case for study presents its own challenges. The surreptitious infiltration into the Google network discovered in 2010, termed Operation Aurora, was selected for study not only because of its high level of publicity, but also because it provoked a rare public response from the two major governments involved, the United States and China.\nCertainly, there are disadvantages to employing case study methodology as well. More particularly, employing a single case study fails to account for the fact that many governments routinely engage in acts of economic espionage aimed squarely at private actors within competitor states. It is also requires generalization from one particular case, involving two state actors, to the wider groups of states. This has significant drawbacks because states do not behave in a uniform fashion, they are not motivated or constrained by the same things, and may take a differing view of a particular act. It is also impossible to ever truly know what is motivating a state to undertake a particular course of action. The fact is that generalizing from one observation is a poor mechanism for understanding the motivations of state behavior in a wider context. However, undertaking a detailed case study analysis of the actual conduct of an\nMedia of Rules, 13 GERMAN L.J. 1508, 1518 (“Following the disastrous experience with secret treaties in the lead up to World War I, and responding to demands for transparency from citizens as democracy expanded, states agreed to prohibit secret treaties in international law.

Nation states and criminals target our government and private sector information networks to gain competitive advantage in the commercial sector.”).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809828\ninfiltration that has been publicly exposed is valuable, notwithstanding its drawbacks. The rare public glimpse into the otherwise murky world of international espionage provides valuable evidence for the evaluation of both state practice and opinio juris regarding these actions.\nWhen evaluating the significance of state practice in relation to customary legal rules and espionage, it is a mistake simply to evaluate the conduct of the state that has engaged in the offensive operations. Rather, when operations are uncovered, the response of the offended government is just as, if not more important. Thus, the Google infiltration provides an uncommon example, where a major corporation publicly disclosed the infiltration first, forcing the governments of both states to respond. For that reason, this section will evaluate not only the conduct attributed to the Chinese government in relation to the infiltration of Google and Operation Aurora, but also the response of the United States Government.\n## 1. The Aurora Exploit\nOn January 12, 2010, David Drummond, Senior Vice-President and Chief Legal Officer of Google publicly disclosed that his company had fallen victim to a major network infiltration. Drummond indicated on the company's official blog, that Google had “detected a highly sophisticated and targeted attack on our corporate infrastructure originating from China that resulted in the theft of intellectual property from Google.” During their internal investigations into the infiltration, the company determined that at least twenty other large companies in the Internet, finance, technology, media and chemical sectors were also targeted. They also uncovered evidence to suggest that “a primary goal of the attackers was accessing the Gmail accounts of Chinese human rights activists.”\nAccording to subsequent investigations undertaken by the Internet security firm, McAfee, Operation Aurora initially targeted an individual user within Google. This individual would then receive a link in either an email or through an instant message that purported to be from a trusted source. Once the targeted user clicked on the link at their computer, they would be directed to a website hosted on servers in Taiwan that contained a malicious JavaScript payload. Once at the nefarious website, the Internet browser program being used to view the website automatically downloaded and executed the malicious program code, which included a zero-day Internet Explorer exploit. The exploit then executed the malicious payload, which set up a backdoor and the networked computer of the unsuspecting user was then remotely connected to command\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809828\n David Drummond, *A new approach to China*, GOOGLE: OFFICIAL BLOG (Jan. 12, 2010) http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/01/new-approach-to-china.html\n David Drummond, *A new approach to China*, GOOGLE: OFFICIAL BLOG (Jan. 12, 2010) http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/01/new-approach-to-china.html\n In basic terms, JavaScript is computer-coding language employed in numerous popular applications including websites and PDFs.\n A zero-day exploit is the term of art among software developers and hackers that refers to a previously unknown vulnerability in a computer application. The use of the term zero-day, is meant to connote that the first attack on the software takes place on “day zero” of vulnerability awareness on the part of the software developer. It also means that the software developers have had zero days to develop a software “patch” that addresses the vulnerability in question.\n When attempting to remotely access a computer there is typically an authentication process, which ensures that the party seeking access is entitled to that access. By placing a “back door” on the system, the party seeking access can bypass the normal process of authentication and can have virtually unfettered access to the target system.\nand control servers in Taiwan. Once connected to these command servers the “attackers had complete access to internal systems. They targeted sources of intellectual property, including software configuration management (SCM) systems accessible by the compromised system.”\nThe methods employed during the exploit seem clear. However, actually attributing that covert network exploitation back to the Chinese Government is a different story. In this respect, one report prepared for the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission by Northrop Grumman Corp stated that:\nThe publicly disclosed evidence linking Chinese state sponsorship to the Google intrusion is compelling but still largely circumstantial. Analysis of the malware by third party specialists identified only a small component of the overall code that clearly had a Chinese pedigree; the information targeted was both Google source code and email accounts reportedly of Chinese human rights activists, suggesting a political as well as economic motivation. The IP addresses for the C2 nodes discovered during the forensic investigation were attributed to a Chinese college that has been linked in the past to alleged state sponsored network exploitation activity.\nHowever, in a leaked classified cable from the United States Embassy in Beijing, the United States government was informed that “[a] well-placed contact claims that the Chinese government coordinated the recent intrusions of Google systems. According to our contact, the closely held operations were directed at the Politburo Standing Committee level.” While according to the same cable, “Another contact claimed a top PRC leader was actively working with Google competitor Baidu against Google.” In the world of intelligence gathering, there are few certainties; but this cable is close. Although undated, it seems clear that the United States Government was advised shortly after Operation Aurora, and in no uncertain terms, that the infiltration was directed at the Politburo Standing Committee level. The Politburo Standing Committee consists of the top leadership of the Communist Party of China and is the most powerful decision-making body of the Chinese Government.\n## 2. The Response of the United States Government\nThe response of the United States Government was confusing and watered down. It was confusing because it did not reflect the reality of what the United States Government knew had taken place. It was watered down, because the response morphed over time, from what looked like a strong protest, to a situation where the State Department would not even use the word *demarche* to classify their response toward the Chinese Government.\n MCAFEE LABS AND MCAFEE FOUNDSTONE PROFESSIONAL SERVICES, PROTECTING YOUR CRITICAL ASSETS: LESSONS LEARNED FROM “OPERATION AURORA”, available at http://www.mcafee.com/us/resources/white-papers/wp-protecting-critical-assets.pdf.\n BRYAN KREKEL, PATTON ADAMS &amp; GEORGE BAKOS, OCCUPYING THE INFORMATION HIGH GROUND: CHINESE CAPABILITIES FOR COMPUTER NETWORK OPERATIONS AND CYBER ESPIONAGE 99, Prepared for the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission by Northrop Grumman Corp.

We look to the Chinese government for an explanation.”41 Then, merely one day later, Assistant Secretary of State, Phillip Crowley, in response to a question on the Google infiltration stated that: “I wouldn’t say that this is necessarily different than the range of issues that we continue to work on with China.”42 Thus, the official response morphed in less than 24 hours, from one of serious concern regarding the covert infiltration of Google, to one in which this issue was no different, or more important, then the other issues involved in the bilateral relations between the two states.\nThe tone changed again the following day. During the January 14, 2010, press briefing Assistant Secretary of State Crowley stated that “this is – it’s a serious issue on a number of levels. As we have talked about, there are business standards and expectations, international norms that you expect your business partners to live up to. And we have had multiple conversations with China about activity both in this area and more broadly.”43 He then went on to state that: “We [the United States Government] have raised this issue today in saying that we have serious concerns about this and its ramifications.”44\nThen on January 15, 2010, the United States Government decided to issue a diplomatic demarche. During the press briefing, Assistant Secretary of State Crowley stated that: “We will be issuing a formal demarche to the Chinese Government in Beijing on this issue in the coming days, probably early next week. [It] will express our concern for this incident and request information from China as to an explanation of how it happened and what they plan to do about it.”45 Notwithstanding this unambiguous statement regarding the issuance of a demarche, it is important to note that a demarche is simply formal diplomatic representation of a government’s official position. They can be used as a mechanism to protest or object to actions by a foreign government, but do not necessarily imply the illegality of those actions. Certainly a government may use a demarche to register its position that a certain act undertaken by a foreign government contravened international law, but this will depend entirely on the wording of the document.\nStill, there was a significant softening of this position on January 19, 2010. On that day during the press briefing, Assistant Secretary of State Kurt M. Campbell was asked “whether that\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809828\ndemarche has been formally issued over the Google case\".46 Campbell responded that the United States Government has had \"multiple meetings with Chinese authorities\" that they \"take this matter very seriously\" and that \"the whole issue does raise serious concerns.\"47 The language of using a diplomatic demarche had disappeared from the parlance of the State Department; instead now the United States Government was content to ask \"them [the Government of China] for an explanation.\"48 Later that day in a separate briefing, Assistant Secretary of State Crowley was asked \"has that demarche been issued and can you tell us what it says?\". The response was terse: \"Kurt [Assistant Secretary of State Campbell] made clear that he had – he said what he said. I'm not going to go further.\"49\nOn January 21, 2010, Secretary of State Clinton spoke on Internet freedom, and during those remarks, she commented that the \"recent situation involving Google has attracted a great deal of interest. And we look to the Chinese authorities to conduct a thorough review of the cyber intrusions that led Google to make its announcement. And we also look for that investigation and its results to be transparent.\"50 The Secretary made no mention of a demarche or other formal rebuke.\nThen on January 22, 2010 the Washington Post reported that a demarche had already been issued, \"according to a State Department official\".51 However, any ambiguity regarding the issuance of the demarche was removed on January 22, 2010, when Assistant Secretary of State Crowley was pointedly asked \"Did you or did you not issue a demarche?\", his response: \"No. Not yet.\"52 Then on February 19, 2010, Crowley was questioned again about the United States formal diplomatic response to the covert infiltration of Google's network. The question: \"I was just wondering - going back to that Goggle [sic] case, there was the discussion that the U.S. is trying to lodge a formal complaint - a demarche on Goggle [sic]. I'm wondering if that has happened or hasn't, and if not, why not?\" The response:\nMR. CROWLEY: Well, I think the – we have had multiple conversations with Chinese officials on this issue, and that included a direct conversation between Secretary Clinton and Foreign Minister Yang in London late last month. So I think we have satisfied ourselves that the Chinese understand the importance with which we view this issue. We have called on the Chinese to conduct a thorough review of cyber intrusions. And they are obviously in the best\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809828\nposition to evaluate what has and continues to occur within their borders.\nQUESTION: So – but just to follow on that, I mean, if the U.S. Government says it's going to make a formal demarche, then it doesn't, does that mean that there's been a change in the assessment of the situation on the ground?\nMR. CROWLEY: Well, I mean, if – a demarche can be a written statement. It can be a verbal statement. The Secretary directly engaged Foreign Minister Yang on this issue. So if you want to call that a demarche – I think we have done what we set out to do, which is to directly express our concerns at high levels about this activity and to encourage China to investigate it thoroughly.53\nIt seems plain that the position of the United States Government morphs over time. The position fluctuates from a issuing a formal demarche to the Chinese Government in Beijing, which expressed serious concern, to a position where the State Department was unwilling to refer to their actions in those terms, referring instead to “high level talks” and “engagement”. The final softening of the United States’ response came several months after the initial announcement by Google.\nOn March 19, 2010 Secretary of State Clinton was asked: “What has the Chinese Government told you about their investigation? What kind of pressure are you putting on the Chinese Government?”. The response from the Secretary of State was: “Well, specifically, with respect to Google, this is really between Google and China.”54 There was no indication that there was any formal response from the Chinese government related to an investigation or any hint that the Chinese Government had shared a plan to interdict these types of infiltrations.\nFor its part, the United States Congress had a less equivocal response. Senate Resolution 405 was introduced on February 2, 2010. It stated that the Senate: “Condemns the cyber attacks allegedly launched from China against Google and other companies and calls on the government of China to review such cyber intrusions.”55 The Resolution was co-sponsored by senior senators from both parties including Senators McCain, Lieberman, Specter and Feingold. It was considered, and agreed to without amendment and with a preamble by Unanimous Consent.56 The Preamble states, “this attack was one in a series of attempts to exploit security flaws and illegally access computer networks of individuals and institutions through the clandestine installation of phishing and malware technology.”57 Senator Kaufman rose two days later, and said on the Senate Floor, that “[w]ith the passage of this resolution, countries from which such attacks originate or countries which take steps to restrict or monitor the Internet should consider themselves on notice.”58 It is not clear what that notice would say, given the rather weak public response from the State Department and the Executive Branch.\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809828\nAnother branch of the United States Government also got involved in the response. It was widely reported that the National Security Agency, the cryptologic branch of the Department of Defense, entered into a secret agreement with Google after the intrusion. However, the NSA has never officially acknowledged a collaborative relationship with Google, and a recent United States Court of Appeals, District of Columbia Circuit Court decision, has made it clear that no information regarding any alleged agreement will be forthcoming and such an agreement, if it does exist, is exempt from freedom of information laws.^[59]^\n## 3. The Response of the Government of the People's Republic of China\nThe Chinese Government responded forcefully to the accusations made by both Google and the United States Government. In almost perfect Orwellian double-speak, the spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry indicated, in response that: \"It is China's consistent policy to promote the development of internet. China has its own national conditions and cultural traditions. It supervises internet according to law, which is in parallel with the international practice [sic].\"^[60]^ She went on to say that \"Hacking in whatever form and offence of others' privacy is prohibited by law in China. As a major victim of hacking in the world, China believes that the international community should intensify the cooperaion [sic] in jointly combating internet hacking so as to safeguard internet security and protect the privacy of citizens in accordance with law.\"^[61]^ So, the official position of the Government of China was that they were in no way responsible for the clandestine infiltration of Google's networks, and that the acts in question are considered criminal under Chinese domestic law.\nWhen confronted, China fervently denied having any role in the infiltration of Google's network. What makes this denial such meaningful evidence is that the United States Government - and the public through wikileaks - knew that the Chinese Government coordinated the intrusions of Google's systems and that the operation was directed at the Politburo Standing Committee level.^[62]^ While the public protest of the United States Government was weak and somewhat confusing, it certainly would not count as acquiescence toward the practice. However, in the face of this protest the Chinese Government did not seek to justify its conduct using legal argument or by relying on an existing or emerging customary legal rule. Rather, the Chinese Government completely denied the allegations. In fact, in their public response the Chinese Government pushes for more intense international cooperation to combat these occurrences.\nPut another way, there is no evidence of opinio juris surrounding the conduct of the states that engage in acts of economic cyber espionage or in the actions of the states that are victim. There has never been a public case of a state seeking to justify acts of cyber espionage as something that is defensible pursuant to international law. States do not feel compelled as a matter of legal obligation to engage in these acts, nor do states feel compelled to remain silent or acquiesce\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809828\nwhen they fall victim. There is no rule of customary international law that justifies a breach of the principle of non-interference, because there is absolutely no *opinio juris* to support what is – in all reality – a thriving clandestine state practice. And while the response of the United States Government was weaker than one might have expected, the fact is that it was a long way from passive acquiescence toward the conduct.\n## PART III - TRANSNATIONAL LEGALISM AND CYBER GOVERNANCE\nAs the above example shows, the international governance regime surrounding cyber espionage is still in its infancy. As such, simply determining whether these actions are legal or illegal is not enough. Rather, the legal rules and the norms that govern conduct in cyber space are in a period of flux and evolution. In order to understand these changes, one must understand the process of transnational legal evolution. The “[t]ransnational legal process describes the theory and practice of how public and private actors -- nation-states, international organizations, multinational enterprises, non-governmental organizations, and private individuals -- interact in a variety of public and private, domestic and international fora to make, interpret, enforce, and ultimately, internalize rules of transnational law.”63\nIn this way, the lens of transnational legalism provides several distinct advantages over the more traditional binary legal/illegal analysis noted above. It describes the complex and dynamic connection between the formation of norms within the international community and the reception and interpretation of those norms into domestic law and practice, while also providing an account of the influence of domestic norms on the development of international rules. It allows for a better and more complete understanding of the role of non-state actors, which are increasingly central players within the international community; moving away from the strictures of the traditional state centric analytical framework allows for a more holistic understanding of global affairs and has significantly greater descriptive validity – because it can accurately account for the fast moving and multi-faceted transnational interactions in the realm of cyber security generally and cyber espionage.\nIn transnational practice, “repeated interactions among states and a variety of domestic and transnational actors produce interpretations of applicable global norms which can be and are eventually internalized into states’ domestic values and processes.”64 Under transnational legal theory, “various agents of internalization – which include transnational norm entrepreneurs, governmental norm sponsors, transnational issue networks, issue linkages and interpretive communities – can provoke nations to move from grudging compliance to habitual internalized obedience with international rules.”65 Given the foregoing, the value of this theoretical model does not stop at its descriptive validity; rather, it has “both predictive capacity and explanatory\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809828\npower regarding questions of causation.\"66 Transnational legal theory predicts that nations are most likely to comply with international norms if transnational legal processes are “aggressively triggered by other transnational actors in a way that forces interaction in forums capable of generating norms, followed by norm-internalization.”67 This process of “interaction and internalization in turn leads a national government to engage in new modes of interest-recognition and identity-formation in a way that eventually leads the nation-state back into compliance.”68\nWhile it is appropriate to conclude that certain acts of cyber espionage are illegal as a matter of international law, and that there is no countervailing customary norm that provides a legal excuse or justification, it is equally appropriate to conclude that the raging practice of cyber espionage among states means that many have yet to subscribe to the norm and to internalize it in their conduct. Thus, with respect to cyber espionage, the global community is engaged at the earlier stages of the transnational legal process of repeated interaction and interpretation. This ongoing process is further complicated by the fact that there are competing norms being advanced by major actors with conflicting geostrategic interests.\nRecent treaty negotiations aimed at Internet regulation broke down over divergent views over the role of the state in international Internet governance.69 The fault line between the United States and Europe, on the one hand, and a coalition of states led by Russia and China, on the other, has also been exposed in relation to the international norms applicable to information security. In September 2011, the Governments of China, the Russian Federation, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan sent a draft International Code of Conduct for information security to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General.\nUnder the terms of the Code of Conduct, each state voluntarily subscribing to the code pledges: “Not to use information and communications technologies, including networks, to carry out hostile activities or acts of aggression, pose threats to international peace and security”.70 At first blush, by sponsoring the Code of Conduct, it would appear that the Governments of China and Russia are prepared to voluntarily pledge not to use information and communications technologies to carry out hostile activities. Given that states now view network integrity as fundamental to their national security, covert network infiltration and economic cyber espionage is unquestionably a hostile act. Therefore, under the Code of Conduct, Russia and China are prepared to disavow the legitimacy of cyber espionage as a tool of strategic and economic policy. This, however, is completely disingenuous.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809828\nThe fact is that both Russia and China are most persistent collectors of economic intelligence. According to a recent report from the Office of the National Counter Intelligence Executive, “Chinese actors are the world’s most active and persistent perpetrators of economic espionage. US private sector firms and cybersecurity specialists have reported an onslaught of computer network intrusions that have originated in China”.71 While at the same time “Russia’s intelligence services are conducting a range of activities to collect economic information and technology from US targets.”72\nThere are two main reasons that China and Russia engage in such aggressive economic cyber espionage, while at the same time they articulate a norm against it on the international stage. First, as a matter of geostrategic interest, “China and Russia view themselves as strategic competitors of the United States and are the most aggressive collectors of US economic information and technology.”73 Second, as a technical matter, these types of intrusions rarely get detected, and when they do they are notoriously difficult to attribute back to a state actor. As a consequence, Russia and China can act in a way that directly contradicts the norm that they are espousing, because there is a relatively low risk of discovery and attribution. It is not in their immediate interests to comply with that norm – the rewards are too high and the risks too low.\nAt the same time, countries like the United States and the United Kingdom are genuinely advocating for the establishment of, and reliance on, a comparable normative framework. Given the position of the United States as a global leader in intellectual property generation, it is not surprising that they would seek the enablement of a rules based regime that aims to hold the perpetrators of acts economic cyber espionage accountable for those actions. The most clear articulation of the policy of the United States Government toward acts of international economic cyber espionage is found in the May 2011 International Strategy for Cyber Space, signed by President Barack Obama. The International Strategy indicates:\nThe persistent theft of intellectual property, whether by criminals, foreign firms, or state actors working on their behalf, can erode competitiveness in the global economy, and businesses’ opportunities to innovate. The United States will take measures to identify and respond to such actions to help build an international environment that recognizes such acts as unlawful and impermissible, and hold such actors accountable.74\nGiven the foregoing it is not clear whether it is the position of the United States Government that the theft of intellectual property by state actors is currently recognized by the United States government as illegal, pursuant to international law, and that they are working to build on that within the international community. Or, if the United States Government will view this conduct as unlawful (pursuant to international law) once it has been accepted in the “international\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809828\nenvironment”. But, it is clear that it is not in either the short or long-term interests of the United States Government, or any similarly situated government, to allow economic cyber espionage to continue, constrained only by the vague notions of illegality provided by customary law. Because the United States does not spy for its domestic companies,75 it has no ability to engage in tit-for-tat diplomacy; meaning in response to the infiltration of Google’s network, there is no incentive for the United States to undertake a comparable infiltration of Baidu - the dominant Chinese search engine. It is, however, perfectly rational against this factual backdrop, for the United States to seek to advance a normative construct of illegality to constrain the behavior of other state actors. Thus, pushing for a clearer set of norms acts as one tool to attempt to influence the unwanted behaviors of other states.76\nIn this way, traditional notions of customary law or the internationalization of general principles do not adequately describe the contemporary governance mechanisms in place that address cyber espionage. Rather, the governance landscape is comprised of emerging norms of conduct, supported by major international actors, that are pursuing their interests and seeking to constrain the ability of other states to exploit the intellectual property and confidential information of the companies that operate in their territory or are regulated by them. At the same time, many states engage in covert network infiltrations into the networks of companies located in their competitor states for economic, as well as political, reasons. When these activities are exposed, states are careful to distance themselves from the conduct. As noted, this suggests that there is no opinio juris supporting the conduct, that it offends the principle of non-interference, and that there is no competing legal rule changing that. But the story does not stop there.\nAt the international level, states like the United States are pushing to have an explicit norm recognized within the international community that prohibits economic cyber espionage, rather than subsisting on the implied norm against it that comes as part of the principle of non-interference. At the domestic level the majority of states already prohibit the types of network intrusions, data interference and intercepts that form the tools of the cyber espionage trade. But, more importantly, these states also – in some instances – seek to prohibit this conduct extraterritoriality and they do so with a legitimate basis under international law. All of this creates a unique legal position for economic cyber espionage: it is implicitly prohibited under customary international law, with a normative push to make it explicitly prohibited, all while states use municipal law to prohibit the conduct domestically and transnationally. Layered on top of this is the trend toward allowing a more permissive regime for national security and non-economic related acts of cyber espionage.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809828\n# PART IV – CONCLUSIONS\nAt this point in time, it is not entirely clear how the legal rules or norms of conduct will develop within this policy space. It is not surprising that the United States is pushing to create a strong normative and legal framework prohibiting acts of economic cyber espionage, because they have the most to lose and the least to gain from these types of activities. The United States generates major amounts of intellectual property and its firms routinely rely on sensitive and proprietary information in their business practices. At the same time, there is no ability within the United States’ system to translate stolen economic intelligence into an actionable intelligence product, because the United States does not have the ability to convey this stolen information to its domestic companies. After all, if the NSA were to steal the design for a revolutionary hybrid automotive engine from an Asian or European auto manufacturer, who would they give it to: Ford? General Motors? Chrysler? They would be effectively picking winners and losers in the free market economy, something which the United States Government tries not to do. It is also not surprising that the United States would seek a more permissive regime when it comes to security related intelligence, because the United States is widely believed to have the most sophisticated offensive cyber arsenal on the planet.\nHowever, this push to bifurcate the rules – with one set of rules for economically motivated cyber espionage and one set for security related cyber espionage – sets up an interesting problem. The difficulty is that this framework would require target states to understand the motivation behind a particular intrusion in order to accurately gage the legality of that act. It also presupposes that a clear line can be drawn between economic and security interests – which of course is not true. Suppose for example that State A dropped a logic bomb on the central server of the national bank in State B. What if the purpose of this act was to activate the nefarious code only in the event of a kinetic conflict between the two states to undermine the economy within the target state? But, what if the purpose of the logic bomb was solely to undermine consumer confidence in that bank and to push consumer and business investments elsewhere? The act, placing nefarious code on the server, is the exact same. It is only the motivation that differs. And, in cyberspace, it will be difficult if not impossible to accurately assess the motivation behind any particular act. Therefore, the notion of setting up a dual regime with permissive rules for security related espionage and restrictive rules for economic espionage rests on top of two fallacies. First, that a target can tell the difference between acts that are economic in nature versus those that are security related, and that there is an actual difference between the two. And second, that a target will be able to ascertain why a particular clandestine cyber act was undertaken. This bifurcation of espionage related activities is simply not a sustainable way to create realistic rules of the road for espionage in cyber space.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809828",

      "flat_text": "# CYBER ESPIONAGE AND INTERNATIONAL LAW\n## BY AARON SHULL\n## INTRODUCTION\nThe place of espionage under international law is an uneasy one. Many look to state practice, and conclude that acts of espionage must surely be legal because so many states spy on one another. Others say that sending spies in to the territory of another state breaches the norm of territorial and sovereign integrity, and therefore acts of espionage should rightly be considered illegal pursuant to the relevant legal rules. The difficulty in assessing legality is amplified when analyzing cyber intrusions, because they do not offend the principle of territorial integrity in the same way that sending an actual state agent to gather human intelligence (colloquially referred to as “HUMINT”) would. This paper is an attempt to address these legal ambiguities.\nHowever, because there is no public multilateral treaty that addresses acts of cyber espionage, recourse must be made to the customary rules to determine the position of espionage under international law. At its most basic level, customary law is comprised of the rules that emerge as a matter of past practice amongst nation states, and which come to govern future relations between them. The Statute of the International Court of Justice defines customary law as “evidence of a general practice accepted as law.” This has been interpreted to mean that for a customary norm of conduct to crystallize into a binding rule – gaining formal status under international law – two constituent criteria must be met. First, there must be widespread and consistent state practice. Second, the activity in question, or the abstinence of states from engaging in a particular activity, must be done out of a sense of legal compulsion. This second element, called *opinio juris*, is used to differentiate state actions that are legally obliged from those undertaken for some other purpose (like self-interest or comity).\nThe starting point for the application of international rules is the often cited *Lotus* principle, which asserts that a sovereign state may undertake any action they wish, as long as that action is not explicitly prohibited. The relevant question then becomes: Is there an explicit prohibition on acts of cyber espionage? The research goal of this paper is to answer that question, and in answering this question the paper will make three arguments.\nFirst, that despite the fact that states routinely spy on each other, there is no evidence to support the proposition that state actors view cyber espionage as something that is legal under customary\n Geoffrey B. Demarest, *Espionage in International Law*, 24 DENV. J. INT'L L. &amp; POL'Y 321, 321 (1996); Glenn Sulmasy &amp; John Yoo, *Counterintuitive: Intelligence Operations and International Law*, 28 MICH.

A) No. 10, p. 28 (The Court distinguishes between cases that are binding as a matter of international law, and those which simply represent an ongoing non-obligatory form of conduct stating that “only if such abstention were based on their being conscious of having a duty to abstain would it be possible to speak of an international custom”).\nElectronic copy available at: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2809828\ninternational law. In this regard, while instances of cyber espionage may not offend the territorial integrity of the target state like human spying would, a sound legal conclusion can be drawn that certain intrusions will offend the principle of non-interference under international law. And, if cyber intrusions offend the principle of non-interference, they are correctly considered to be illegal pursuant to the relevant customary rules.\nSecond, the forces that influence the behavior of both state and non-state actors in relation to cyber espionage are much more complicated than a simple determination of legality. Cyber espionage may be illegal, but this vague notion of illegality pursuant to an even vaguer general rule of customary law acts as an extremely poor constraint on state behaviour. Poorly constrained, it is no surprise that states have engaged in a massive campaign of political, economic and military cyber espionage activities. However, many states view the current situation characterized by widespread (and largely unchecked) acts of cyber espionage as unsustainable. It is the explosion in the number of targets created by the Internet that has led the global community in to a process of what international relations scholars call ‘regime’ building, or what international lawyers call the ‘transnational legal process’. Simply put, the existing rules (both hard and soft) that govern behavior are evolving, and new rules are – or at the very least will be – emerging.\nThird, contemporary regime building efforts driven largely by the United States seem poised to build a bifurcated legal regime separating out economic espionage (aimed at private sector interests) from other more traditional forms (aimed largely at states). The most recent evidence of this came during high-level talks between the United States and China, when it became clear that the agenda of the United States was to establish restrictive prohibitions on economically oriented acts of cyber espionage alongside a more permissive regime for traditional security related espionage. After the first day of talks, an American official said in relation to the theft of intellectual property, “we don’t do it, and we don’t think any country should do it.” For its part, China does not see a comparable distinction between economic and military security. As an example, the China Daily – a government oriented publication – wrote that “by dividing cyberespionage into ‘bad’ and ‘good’ activities, Washington is trying to dictate the rules for global cyberdomain, which is a public space.” Thus, it seems clear that the normative ground is shifting. But given the divergent views among two of the main actors, it remains unclear how fast and how far these normative changes will go to actually curbing unwanted state behavior in cyber space.\nIn order to make these arguments, this paper will proceed as follows. Part I will set out the precise content of the norm of non-interference under international law. Part II will examine state practice and opinio juris in relation to cyber espionage through the lens of the 2010 clandestine entry into Google’s servers – termed operation Aurora – arguing that there is no opinio juris to support state practice and that, even when caught, states tend to deny responsibility for acts of cyber espionage. Part III examines the emerging trend toward a more robust regime, which seeks to place greater constraints on the commission of acts of cyber\n David E.

Finally, Part IV concludes with some recommendations regarding the potential course of evolution in this dynamic area of law.\n## PART I - THE NORM OF NON-INTERFERENCE UNDER INTERNATIONAL LAW AND CYBER ESPIONAGE\nAt its most basic level, the principle of non-interference provides, that “[n]o state has the right to intervene in the internal or external affairs of another.” This general statement of principle seems to elude precise quantification and the jurisprudence is largely unhelpful in determining with any level of specificity the content of the prohibition on foreign interference. The clearest articulation of the norm from the International Court of Justice is that the principle forbids intervention that has a “bearing on matters in which each State is permitted, by the principle of State sovereignty, to decide freely.” The utility of this observation is limited by the fact that the modern regulatory state is free to decide almost anything within its territory, and because there is a serious gap between what a broad view of the norm of non-interference would require and what states actually do in their conduct toward one another. For that reason, determining the content of the norm with precision will require a case-by-case analysis to determine whether the specific conduct in question - in this case cyber espionage - falls within the scope of the prohibition.\nThere have been two broadly supported United Nations General Assembly Resolutions that have some bearing on the scope of the principle. The first is the 1965 the Declaration on the Inadmissibility of Intervention in the Domestic Affairs of States and the Protection of their Independence and Sovereignty (“Declaration on Intervention”). The second is the 1970 Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States in Accordance with the Charter of the United Nations (“Friendly Relations Declaration”). These two documents are strikingly similar, with only modest differences. The relevant operative paragraph of the Friendly Relations Declaration is slightly more robust, stating:\nNo State or group of States has the right to intervene, directly or indirectly, for any reason whatever, in the internal or external affairs of any other State. Consequently, armed intervention and all other forms of interference or attempted threats against the personality of the State or against its political, economic and cultural elements, are in violation of international law.\nThus, within the Friendly Relations Declaration, which is widely regarded to reflect customary\nElectronic copy available at: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2809828\n\nlaw, there is an explicit prohibition on any form of interference with the political, economic and cultural elements of another state. However, the International Court of Justice narrowed this broad articulation in the Nicaragua decision, noting that:\nA prohibited intervention must accordingly be one bearing on matters in which each State is permitted, by the principle of State sovereignty, to decide freely. One of these is the choice of a political, economic, social and cultural system, and the formulation of foreign policy. Intervention is wrongful when it uses methods of coercion in regard to such choices, which must remain free ones.\nThe problem is that the Court does not go on to define with any level of specificity what the content of the prohibition on interference actually is. The Court indicates that in order to be prohibited under international law an intervention must be one bearing on matters that each State is permitted, by the principle of State sovereignty, to decide freely. Unfortunately, rather than clarifying this position, the Court – curiously – goes on to consider whether there is any customary international law allowing intervention. Thus, the actual content of the norm of non-interference is left ill-defined and extremely vague.\nThe Nicaragua decision is further limited by the fact that it is decided at that outset that the \"Court will define only those aspects of the principle which appear to be relevant to the resolution of the dispute.\" In this respect this case is lacking because, in many ways, the discussion of non-interference/non-intervention is subsumed within the larger discussion of the prohibition on the use of force that is the immediate subject matter of the decision. Therefore, the decision really provides only a partial discussion of the principle of non-interference. The Court explicitly chooses to discuss only those aspects of the principle relevant to the case before it. By definition then, the principle of non-interference goes beyond the narrow articulation presented by the Court. Consequently, states and legal scholars alike were left with only a partial explanation of the rule and with an unfinished legal test to determine which acts will actually offend the rule against foreign interference. What if any relevance does this limited test have for determining if a particular act of cyber espionage will offend the principle against non-interference? The simple answer is not much.\nPursuant to the test for interference posited in the Nicaragua case, in order to fall within the definition of prohibited intervention, the act in question must be intended to force or coerce a change of policy within the victim state. This formulation is not without support in the literature. Russell Buchan recently put forward a rote articulation of this test, in relation to cyber interference. Buchan argues:\nAll in all, in order to establish a violation of the non-intervention principle two questions must be addressed. First, is the intervention intended to force the victim State into a change of policy? [...] Secondly, if the intention to impose coercion is present, it must then be asked whether the application of coercion bears upon matters\n Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua (Nicar. v. U.S.), Judgment, 1986 I.C.J. 14, 202 (June 27) (“The principle of non-intervention involves the right of every sovereign State to conduct its affairs without outside interference; though examples of trespass against this principle are not infrequent, the Court considers that it is part and parcel of customary international law.”).\n Ibid., 205 (emphasis added).\n Ibid.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809828\nwhich a state is entitled to freely determine itself.\nThe problem is that adopting this legal standard would exclude from international regulation all acts of cyber aggression that had no physical (or kinetic) effect, and which were motived by something other than a desire to influence policy within the target state. As an example, in February of 2011 the Internet security firm, McAfee, uncovered a major network infiltration using IP addresses located in China. The intrusion, labeled “Night Dragon”, targeted Western oil and energy companies and “[t]he goal of the intrusions was to obtain information on sensitive competitive proprietary operations and on financing of oil and gas field bids and operations.” In this case, valuable proprietary information was stolen and a significant benefit would have accrued to the relevant Chinese agencies or firms. However, because the objective was to obtain sensitive information and to use it against Chinese competitors, according to the circumspect test of the International Court of Justice in Nicaragua or the analysis put forward by Buchan, this would not qualify as an unlawful intervention or interference. This is because the breach was not intended to change a policy within the victim state.\nThis notion is deeply problematic given that the gravamen of the offence of unlawful interference is intervening in to the sphere over which the target state has authority. States – acting in their capacity as a sovereign – have the ability to regulate telecommunications, Internet service providers, intellectual property rights, and criminal sanctions related to data breaches. The exercise of these rights has nothing to do with the intent of the offending party. Rather, the right itself flows from state sovereignty. It is the intervention within the affairs of a sovereign state that is offensive, regardless of the intent of the intervening party.\nHowever, given the limits of the applicable jurisprudence, all that can really be said about the status of the law is that it remains unclear and ill-suited to address clandestine cyber intrusions. The law is unclear because there is no authoritative decision that unequivocally demarcates the boundaries of an independent right of non-interference. The law is ill-suited to address cyber intrusions, because if a requisite element of the test of non-interference is the requirement to influence policy in the target state, then intrusions that are motivated by some other desire (i.e. economics) and which are meant to remain covert will rarely – if ever – meet this threshold. Employing a purposive (intent based) analysis to determine whether or not a covert cyber entry will offend the principle of non-interference is inappropriate because it sets up an impossible test – how can one ever know what the intention is behind a clandestine network entry?\n Russell Buchan, *Cyber Attacks: Unlawful Uses of Force or Prohibited Interventions?* 2 J. OF CONFLICT &amp; SEC. L. 211, 224-225.\n These would likely be governed under Article 2(4) of the United Nations Charter as a use of force. See Matthew C. Waxman, *Cyber-Attacks and the Use of Force: Back to the Future of Article 2(4)*, 36 YALE J. INT'L L. 421 (“there is considerable momentum among American scholars and policy experts behind the idea that some cyber-attacks ought to fall within Article 2(4)'s prohibition of \"force\" or could constitute an \"armed attack,\" at least insofar as those terms should be interpreted to cover attacks with features and consequences closely resembling conventional military attacks or kinetic force.”).\n See OFFICE OF THE NAT'L COUNTERINTELLIGENCE EXEC., *FOREIGN SPIES STEALING US ECONOMIC SECRETS IN CYBERSPACE: REPORT TO CONGRESS ON FOREIGN ECONOMIC COLLECTION AND INDUSTRIAL ESPIONAGE*, 2009-2011, 5 (2011) [COUNTERINTELLIGENCE REPORT].\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809828\nNotwithstanding these challenges, there is limited support within the literature for the proposition that acts of cyber espionage will offend the principle of non-interference. In this regard, Mary Ellen O'Connell writes:\nJust because a cyber-attack or cyber espionage do not amount to an armed attack does not mean that international law has no law against such wrongs. Interference with a State's economic sphere, air space, maritime space or territorial space, even if not prohibited by treaty is prohibited under the general principle of non-intervention. This is apparent in a number of treaties, UN resolutions and ICJ decisions that condemn coercion, interference or intervention that falls short of the use of force.\nEven with this limited scholarly support, the actual content of the norm against cyber interference remains amorphous. Surely the norm would not encompass every mild cyber incident, but it must still protect the customary norm that “every sovereign state [has a right] to conduct its affairs without outside interference.” By definition then, determining which cyber intrusions offend the principle of non-interference and which do not will be an exercise in legal line drawing. Suppose for example that State A plans to infiltrate a functioning nuclear power plant in State B. The purpose is to force B to change a foreign policy position. When B decides not to change its position, A activates previously placed nefarious code, or “logic bomb”, and causes a meltdown. This would offend both the prohibition on the use of force and easily offend the principle of non-interference. However, suppose B infiltrates the network of the company that makes the reactor to steal industrial designs, recognizing a major cost savings in the establishment of a domestic nuclear power industry. Would this offend the principle of non-interference? What if B just looks at the designs but does not use them for any purpose?\nThese examples demonstrate a clear need to rearticulate the test for prohibited interference in relation to cyber intrusions, moving away from a test that is based on the intent of the offending party to one based on the potential effect of the intrusion. The principle of non-interference is often said to be a corollary of the principle of state sovereignty. A corollary is something which is a “proposition that follows from a proven proposition with little or no additional proof; something that naturally flows.” In this way, the content of the norm of non-interference should naturally follow the contours of the principle of state sovereignty. Thus, if the intrusion\n Mary Ellen O'Connell, *Cyber Security without Cyber War*, 2 J. OF CONFLICT &amp; SEC.

This is a permissible interpretation of the rule, because as noted above, the International Court of Justice’s previous ruling on the issue dealt with only a narrow application of the norm and only to the extent that was necessary to deal with matters immediately before it in the Nicaragua case.\nIf one adopts this rearticulated effects based test, then covert entry into networks accompanied by the stealing of intellectual property, which undermines confidence in the Internet and telecommunications generally, threatens national security, or undermines the financial position or competiveness of domestic companies – and the corresponding revenue base of their governments – could potentially offend the principle of non-interference. This would necessarily be subject to the doctrine of de minimis non curat lex, or the idea that the law does not concern itself with trifles. Thus, in order to offend the principle, there should be some significant effect attached to the cyber intrusion. If, these criteria are met, then a reasonable reading of the principle of non-interference as articulated in Declaration on Intervention and the Friendly Relations Declaration, which are considered to be customary law, would recognize these events as prohibited.\nThe main anticipated critique to the conception of a norm of non-interference that that would prohibit these forms of cyber intrusions is that state practice diverges markedly from it. Universally, articles on the law of espionage rely on the fact that many states engage in espionage as a justification for its legality. The thrust of the response is that secret state practice is legally irrelevant. The fact that states hide their behavior reinforces the existence of a prohibition, but more importantly, there is strong authority for the proposition that secret state practice is a deficient and unsatisfactory marker in the establishment of a legal rule, or change in its content. According to the International Law Association’s Committee on Formation of Customary (General) International Law, a “secret physical act (e.g. secretly “bugging” diplomatic premises) is probably not an example of the objective element. And if the act is discovered, it probably does not count as State practice unless the State tries to assert that its conduct was legally justified.” The very notion of a rule of law presupposes that the rule be public. The United Nation Charter bans secret treaties, and the same logic would apply to a\n THE WHITE HOUSE, CYBERSPACE POLICY REVIEW, ASSURING A TRUSTED AND RESILIENT INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE (2009) available at http://www.whitehouse.gov/assets/documents/Cyberspace_Policy_Review_final.pdf (“Other intrusions threaten to damage portions of our critical infrastructure.

There is simply no compelling reason for secret state practice to change the rules of public international law.\n## PART II – CYBER ESPIONAGE AND STATE PRACTICE\nEvaluating state practice in relation to the collection of intelligence from human sources or through signals intercepts is difficult for obvious reasons, not least of which is the fact that these activities are meant to be clandestine. Evaluating the practice of states in relation to espionage committed via the Internet is more difficult still, because not only are the activities clandestine, but there are significant challenges with both technical and legal attribution, and even when breaches are uncovered, in many cases the victims are corporations – not states – and often times they do not report the breaches to their own government.\nTherefore, employing case study methodology has distinct advantages over generalizations regarding state practice in this area. However, owing to the furtive character of espionage, selecting an appropriate case for study presents its own challenges. The surreptitious infiltration into the Google network discovered in 2010, termed Operation Aurora, was selected for study not only because of its high level of publicity, but also because it provoked a rare public response from the two major governments involved, the United States and China.\nCertainly, there are disadvantages to employing case study methodology as well. More particularly, employing a single case study fails to account for the fact that many governments routinely engage in acts of economic espionage aimed squarely at private actors within competitor states. It is also requires generalization from one particular case, involving two state actors, to the wider groups of states. This has significant drawbacks because states do not behave in a uniform fashion, they are not motivated or constrained by the same things, and may take a differing view of a particular act. It is also impossible to ever truly know what is motivating a state to undertake a particular course of action. The fact is that generalizing from one observation is a poor mechanism for understanding the motivations of state behavior in a wider context. However, undertaking a detailed case study analysis of the actual conduct of an\nMedia of Rules, 13 GERMAN L.J. 1508, 1518 (“Following the disastrous experience with secret treaties in the lead up to World War I, and responding to demands for transparency from citizens as democracy expanded, states agreed to prohibit secret treaties in international law.

The rare public glimpse into the otherwise murky world of international espionage provides valuable evidence for the evaluation of both state practice and opinio juris regarding these actions.\nWhen evaluating the significance of state practice in relation to customary legal rules and espionage, it is a mistake simply to evaluate the conduct of the state that has engaged in the offensive operations. Rather, when operations are uncovered, the response of the offended government is just as, if not more important. Thus, the Google infiltration provides an uncommon example, where a major corporation publicly disclosed the infiltration first, forcing the governments of both states to respond. For that reason, this section will evaluate not only the conduct attributed to the Chinese government in relation to the infiltration of Google and Operation Aurora, but also the response of the United States Government.\n## 1. The Aurora Exploit\nOn January 12, 2010, David Drummond, Senior Vice-President and Chief Legal Officer of Google publicly disclosed that his company had fallen victim to a major network infiltration. Drummond indicated on the company's official blog, that Google had “detected a highly sophisticated and targeted attack on our corporate infrastructure originating from China that resulted in the theft of intellectual property from Google.” During their internal investigations into the infiltration, the company determined that at least twenty other large companies in the Internet, finance, technology, media and chemical sectors were also targeted. They also uncovered evidence to suggest that “a primary goal of the attackers was accessing the Gmail accounts of Chinese human rights activists.”\nAccording to subsequent investigations undertaken by the Internet security firm, McAfee, Operation Aurora initially targeted an individual user within Google. This individual would then receive a link in either an email or through an instant message that purported to be from a trusted source. Once the targeted user clicked on the link at their computer, they would be directed to a website hosted on servers in Taiwan that contained a malicious JavaScript payload. Once at the nefarious website, the Internet browser program being used to view the website automatically downloaded and executed the malicious program code, which included a zero-day Internet Explorer exploit. The exploit then executed the malicious payload, which set up a backdoor and the networked computer of the unsuspecting user was then remotely connected to command\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809828\n David Drummond, *A new approach to China*, GOOGLE: OFFICIAL BLOG (Jan. 12, 2010) http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/01/new-approach-to-china.html\n David Drummond, *A new approach to China*, GOOGLE: OFFICIAL BLOG (Jan. 12, 2010) http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/01/new-approach-to-china.html\n In basic terms, JavaScript is computer-coding language employed in numerous popular applications including websites and PDFs.\n A zero-day exploit is the term of art among software developers and hackers that refers to a previously unknown vulnerability in a computer application. The use of the term zero-day, is meant to connote that the first attack on the software takes place on “day zero” of vulnerability awareness on the part of the software developer. It also means that the software developers have had zero days to develop a software “patch” that addresses the vulnerability in question.\n When attempting to remotely access a computer there is typically an authentication process, which ensures that the party seeking access is entitled to that access. By placing a “back door” on the system, the party seeking access can bypass the normal process of authentication and can have virtually unfettered access to the target system.\nand control servers in Taiwan. Once connected to these command servers the “attackers had complete access to internal systems. They targeted sources of intellectual property, including software configuration management (SCM) systems accessible by the compromised system.”\nThe methods employed during the exploit seem clear. However, actually attributing that covert network exploitation back to the Chinese Government is a different story. In this respect, one report prepared for the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission by Northrop Grumman Corp stated that:\nThe publicly disclosed evidence linking Chinese state sponsorship to the Google intrusion is compelling but still largely circumstantial. Analysis of the malware by third party specialists identified only a small component of the overall code that clearly had a Chinese pedigree; the information targeted was both Google source code and email accounts reportedly of Chinese human rights activists, suggesting a political as well as economic motivation. The IP addresses for the C2 nodes discovered during the forensic investigation were attributed to a Chinese college that has been linked in the past to alleged state sponsored network exploitation activity.\nHowever, in a leaked classified cable from the United States Embassy in Beijing, the United States government was informed that “[a] well-placed contact claims that the Chinese government coordinated the recent intrusions of Google systems. According to our contact, the closely held operations were directed at the Politburo Standing Committee level.” While according to the same cable, “Another contact claimed a top PRC leader was actively working with Google competitor Baidu against Google.” In the world of intelligence gathering, there are few certainties; but this cable is close. Although undated, it seems clear that the United States Government was advised shortly after Operation Aurora, and in no uncertain terms, that the infiltration was directed at the Politburo Standing Committee level. The Politburo Standing Committee consists of the top leadership of the Communist Party of China and is the most powerful decision-making body of the Chinese Government.\n## 2. The Response of the United States Government\nThe response of the United States Government was confusing and watered down. It was confusing because it did not reflect the reality of what the United States Government knew had taken place. It was watered down, because the response morphed over time, from what looked like a strong protest, to a situation where the State Department would not even use the word *demarche* to classify their response toward the Chinese Government.\n MCAFEE LABS AND MCAFEE FOUNDSTONE PROFESSIONAL SERVICES, PROTECTING YOUR CRITICAL ASSETS: LESSONS LEARNED FROM “OPERATION AURORA”, available at http://www.mcafee.com/us/resources/white-papers/wp-protecting-critical-assets.pdf.\n BRYAN KREKEL, PATTON ADAMS &amp; GEORGE BAKOS, OCCUPYING THE INFORMATION HIGH GROUND: CHINESE CAPABILITIES FOR COMPUTER NETWORK OPERATIONS AND CYBER ESPIONAGE 99, Prepared for the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission by Northrop Grumman Corp. (March 7, 2012).\n The New York Times, State’s Secrets: A Selection From the Cache of Diplomatic Dispatches, http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2010/11/28/world/20101128-cables-viewer.html#report/china-99BEIJING999.\n Ibid.\n See U.S. Department of State Foreign Affairs Manual Volume 7 – Consular Affairs, at http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/86558.pdf (“A demarche is a formal diplomatic representation of one government’s official position, views, or wishes on a given subject to an appropriate official in another government\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809828\nOn the same day that Google publicly announced that they had been the victim of a network infiltration, Secretary of State Clinton noted that the State Department had been briefed by Google regarding the allegations, which raised “very serious concerns and questions. We look to the Chinese government for an explanation.”41 Then, merely one day later, Assistant Secretary of State, Phillip Crowley, in response to a question on the Google infiltration stated that: “I wouldn’t say that this is necessarily different than the range of issues that we continue to work on with China.”42 Thus, the official response morphed in less than 24 hours, from one of serious concern regarding the covert infiltration of Google, to one in which this issue was no different, or more important, then the other issues involved in the bilateral relations between the two states.\nThe tone changed again the following day. During the January 14, 2010, press briefing Assistant Secretary of State Crowley stated that “this is – it’s a serious issue on a number of levels. As we have talked about, there are business standards and expectations, international norms that you expect your business partners to live up to. And we have had multiple conversations with China about activity both in this area and more broadly.”43 He then went on to state that: “We [the United States Government] have raised this issue today in saying that we have serious concerns about this and its ramifications.”44\nThen on January 15, 2010, the United States Government decided to issue a diplomatic demarche. During the press briefing, Assistant Secretary of State Crowley stated that: “We will be issuing a formal demarche to the Chinese Government in Beijing on this issue in the coming days, probably early next week. [It] will express our concern for this incident and request information from China as to an explanation of how it happened and what they plan to do about it.”45 Notwithstanding this unambiguous statement regarding the issuance of a demarche, it is important to note that a demarche is simply formal diplomatic representation of a government’s official position. They can be used as a mechanism to protest or object to actions by a foreign government, but do not necessarily imply the illegality of those actions. Certainly a government may use a demarche to register its position that a certain act undertaken by a foreign government contravened international law, but this will depend entirely on the wording of the document.\nStill, there was a significant softening of this position on January 19, 2010. On that day during the press briefing, Assistant Secretary of State Kurt M. Campbell was asked “whether that\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809828\ndemarche has been formally issued over the Google case\".46 Campbell responded that the United States Government has had \"multiple meetings with Chinese authorities\" that they \"take this matter very seriously\" and that \"the whole issue does raise serious concerns.\"47 The language of using a diplomatic demarche had disappeared from the parlance of the State Department; instead now the United States Government was content to ask \"them [the Government of China] for an explanation.\"48 Later that day in a separate briefing, Assistant Secretary of State Crowley was asked \"has that demarche been issued and can you tell us what it says?\". The response was terse: \"Kurt [Assistant Secretary of State Campbell] made clear that he had – he said what he said. I'm not going to go further.\"49\nOn January 21, 2010, Secretary of State Clinton spoke on Internet freedom, and during those remarks, she commented that the \"recent situation involving Google has attracted a great deal of interest. And we look to the Chinese authorities to conduct a thorough review of the cyber intrusions that led Google to make its announcement. And we also look for that investigation and its results to be transparent.\"50 The Secretary made no mention of a demarche or other formal rebuke.\nThen on January 22, 2010 the Washington Post reported that a demarche had already been issued, \"according to a State Department official\".51 However, any ambiguity regarding the issuance of the demarche was removed on January 22, 2010, when Assistant Secretary of State Crowley was pointedly asked \"Did you or did you not issue a demarche?\", his response: \"No. Not yet.\"52 Then on February 19, 2010, Crowley was questioned again about the United States formal diplomatic response to the covert infiltration of Google's network. The question: \"I was just wondering - going back to that Goggle [sic] case, there was the discussion that the U.S. is trying to lodge a formal complaint - a demarche on Goggle [sic]. I'm wondering if that has happened or hasn't, and if not, why not?\" The response:\nMR. CROWLEY: Well, I think the – we have had multiple conversations with Chinese officials on this issue, and that included a direct conversation between Secretary Clinton and Foreign Minister Yang in London late last month. So I think we have satisfied ourselves that the Chinese understand the importance with which we view this issue. We have called on the Chinese to conduct a thorough review of cyber intrusions. And they are obviously in the best\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809828\nposition to evaluate what has and continues to occur within their borders.\nQUESTION: So – but just to follow on that, I mean, if the U.S. Government says it's going to make a formal demarche, then it doesn't, does that mean that there's been a change in the assessment of the situation on the ground?\nMR. CROWLEY: Well, I mean, if – a demarche can be a written statement. It can be a verbal statement. The Secretary directly engaged Foreign Minister Yang on this issue. So if you want to call that a demarche – I think we have done what we set out to do, which is to directly express our concerns at high levels about this activity and to encourage China to investigate it thoroughly.53\nIt seems plain that the position of the United States Government morphs over time. The position fluctuates from a issuing a formal demarche to the Chinese Government in Beijing, which expressed serious concern, to a position where the State Department was unwilling to refer to their actions in those terms, referring instead to “high level talks” and “engagement”. The final softening of the United States’ response came several months after the initial announcement by Google.\nOn March 19, 2010 Secretary of State Clinton was asked: “What has the Chinese Government told you about their investigation? What kind of pressure are you putting on the Chinese Government?”. The response from the Secretary of State was: “Well, specifically, with respect to Google, this is really between Google and China.”54 There was no indication that there was any formal response from the Chinese government related to an investigation or any hint that the Chinese Government had shared a plan to interdict these types of infiltrations.\nFor its part, the United States Congress had a less equivocal response. Senate Resolution 405 was introduced on February 2, 2010. It stated that the Senate: “Condemns the cyber attacks allegedly launched from China against Google and other companies and calls on the government of China to review such cyber intrusions.”55 The Resolution was co-sponsored by senior senators from both parties including Senators McCain, Lieberman, Specter and Feingold. It was considered, and agreed to without amendment and with a preamble by Unanimous Consent.56 The Preamble states, “this attack was one in a series of attempts to exploit security flaws and illegally access computer networks of individuals and institutions through the clandestine installation of phishing and malware technology.”57 Senator Kaufman rose two days later, and said on the Senate Floor, that “[w]ith the passage of this resolution, countries from which such attacks originate or countries which take steps to restrict or monitor the Internet should consider themselves on notice.”58 It is not clear what that notice would say, given the rather weak public response from the State Department and the Executive Branch.\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809828\nAnother branch of the United States Government also got involved in the response. It was widely reported that the National Security Agency, the cryptologic branch of the Department of Defense, entered into a secret agreement with Google after the intrusion. However, the NSA has never officially acknowledged a collaborative relationship with Google, and a recent United States Court of Appeals, District of Columbia Circuit Court decision, has made it clear that no information regarding any alleged agreement will be forthcoming and such an agreement, if it does exist, is exempt from freedom of information laws.^[59]^\n## 3. The Response of the Government of the People's Republic of China\nThe Chinese Government responded forcefully to the accusations made by both Google and the United States Government. In almost perfect Orwellian double-speak, the spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry indicated, in response that: \"It is China's consistent policy to promote the development of internet. China has its own national conditions and cultural traditions. It supervises internet according to law, which is in parallel with the international practice [sic].\"^[60]^ She went on to say that \"Hacking in whatever form and offence of others' privacy is prohibited by law in China. As a major victim of hacking in the world, China believes that the international community should intensify the cooperaion [sic] in jointly combating internet hacking so as to safeguard internet security and protect the privacy of citizens in accordance with law.\"^[61]^ So, the official position of the Government of China was that they were in no way responsible for the clandestine infiltration of Google's networks, and that the acts in question are considered criminal under Chinese domestic law.\nWhen confronted, China fervently denied having any role in the infiltration of Google's network. What makes this denial such meaningful evidence is that the United States Government - and the public through wikileaks - knew that the Chinese Government coordinated the intrusions of Google's systems and that the operation was directed at the Politburo Standing Committee level.^[62]^ While the public protest of the United States Government was weak and somewhat confusing, it certainly would not count as acquiescence toward the practice. However, in the face of this protest the Chinese Government did not seek to justify its conduct using legal argument or by relying on an existing or emerging customary legal rule. Rather, the Chinese Government completely denied the allegations. In fact, in their public response the Chinese Government pushes for more intense international cooperation to combat these occurrences.\nPut another way, there is no evidence of opinio juris surrounding the conduct of the states that engage in acts of economic cyber espionage or in the actions of the states that are victim. There has never been a public case of a state seeking to justify acts of cyber espionage as something that is defensible pursuant to international law. States do not feel compelled as a matter of legal obligation to engage in these acts, nor do states feel compelled to remain silent or acquiesce\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809828\nwhen they fall victim. There is no rule of customary international law that justifies a breach of the principle of non-interference, because there is absolutely no *opinio juris* to support what is – in all reality – a thriving clandestine state practice. And while the response of the United States Government was weaker than one might have expected, the fact is that it was a long way from passive acquiescence toward the conduct.\n## PART III - TRANSNATIONAL LEGALISM AND CYBER GOVERNANCE\nAs the above example shows, the international governance regime surrounding cyber espionage is still in its infancy. As such, simply determining whether these actions are legal or illegal is not enough. Rather, the legal rules and the norms that govern conduct in cyber space are in a period of flux and evolution. In order to understand these changes, one must understand the process of transnational legal evolution. The “[t]ransnational legal process describes the theory and practice of how public and private actors -- nation-states, international organizations, multinational enterprises, non-governmental organizations, and private individuals -- interact in a variety of public and private, domestic and international fora to make, interpret, enforce, and ultimately, internalize rules of transnational law.”63\nIn this way, the lens of transnational legalism provides several distinct advantages over the more traditional binary legal/illegal analysis noted above. It describes the complex and dynamic connection between the formation of norms within the international community and the reception and interpretation of those norms into domestic law and practice, while also providing an account of the influence of domestic norms on the development of international rules. It allows for a better and more complete understanding of the role of non-state actors, which are increasingly central players within the international community; moving away from the strictures of the traditional state centric analytical framework allows for a more holistic understanding of global affairs and has significantly greater descriptive validity – because it can accurately account for the fast moving and multi-faceted transnational interactions in the realm of cyber security generally and cyber espionage.\nIn transnational practice, “repeated interactions among states and a variety of domestic and transnational actors produce interpretations of applicable global norms which can be and are eventually internalized into states’ domestic values and processes.”64 Under transnational legal theory, “various agents of internalization – which include transnational norm entrepreneurs, governmental norm sponsors, transnational issue networks, issue linkages and interpretive communities – can provoke nations to move from grudging compliance to habitual internalized obedience with international rules.”65 Given the foregoing, the value of this theoretical model does not stop at its descriptive validity; rather, it has “both predictive capacity and explanatory\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809828\npower regarding questions of causation.\"66 Transnational legal theory predicts that nations are most likely to comply with international norms if transnational legal processes are “aggressively triggered by other transnational actors in a way that forces interaction in forums capable of generating norms, followed by norm-internalization.”67 This process of “interaction and internalization in turn leads a national government to engage in new modes of interest-recognition and identity-formation in a way that eventually leads the nation-state back into compliance.”68\nWhile it is appropriate to conclude that certain acts of cyber espionage are illegal as a matter of international law, and that there is no countervailing customary norm that provides a legal excuse or justification, it is equally appropriate to conclude that the raging practice of cyber espionage among states means that many have yet to subscribe to the norm and to internalize it in their conduct. Thus, with respect to cyber espionage, the global community is engaged at the earlier stages of the transnational legal process of repeated interaction and interpretation. This ongoing process is further complicated by the fact that there are competing norms being advanced by major actors with conflicting geostrategic interests.\nRecent treaty negotiations aimed at Internet regulation broke down over divergent views over the role of the state in international Internet governance.69 The fault line between the United States and Europe, on the one hand, and a coalition of states led by Russia and China, on the other, has also been exposed in relation to the international norms applicable to information security. In September 2011, the Governments of China, the Russian Federation, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan sent a draft International Code of Conduct for information security to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General.\nUnder the terms of the Code of Conduct, each state voluntarily subscribing to the code pledges: “Not to use information and communications technologies, including networks, to carry out hostile activities or acts of aggression, pose threats to international peace and security”.70 At first blush, by sponsoring the Code of Conduct, it would appear that the Governments of China and Russia are prepared to voluntarily pledge not to use information and communications technologies to carry out hostile activities. Given that states now view network integrity as fundamental to their national security, covert network infiltration and economic cyber espionage is unquestionably a hostile act. Therefore, under the Code of Conduct, Russia and China are prepared to disavow the legitimacy of cyber espionage as a tool of strategic and economic policy. This, however, is completely disingenuous.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809828\nThe fact is that both Russia and China are most persistent collectors of economic intelligence. According to a recent report from the Office of the National Counter Intelligence Executive, “Chinese actors are the world’s most active and persistent perpetrators of economic espionage. US private sector firms and cybersecurity specialists have reported an onslaught of computer network intrusions that have originated in China”.71 While at the same time “Russia’s intelligence services are conducting a range of activities to collect economic information and technology from US targets.”72\nThere are two main reasons that China and Russia engage in such aggressive economic cyber espionage, while at the same time they articulate a norm against it on the international stage. First, as a matter of geostrategic interest, “China and Russia view themselves as strategic competitors of the United States and are the most aggressive collectors of US economic information and technology.”73 Second, as a technical matter, these types of intrusions rarely get detected, and when they do they are notoriously difficult to attribute back to a state actor. As a consequence, Russia and China can act in a way that directly contradicts the norm that they are espousing, because there is a relatively low risk of discovery and attribution. It is not in their immediate interests to comply with that norm – the rewards are too high and the risks too low.\nAt the same time, countries like the United States and the United Kingdom are genuinely advocating for the establishment of, and reliance on, a comparable normative framework. Given the position of the United States as a global leader in intellectual property generation, it is not surprising that they would seek the enablement of a rules based regime that aims to hold the perpetrators of acts economic cyber espionage accountable for those actions. The most clear articulation of the policy of the United States Government toward acts of international economic cyber espionage is found in the May 2011 International Strategy for Cyber Space, signed by President Barack Obama. The International Strategy indicates:\nThe persistent theft of intellectual property, whether by criminals, foreign firms, or state actors working on their behalf, can erode competitiveness in the global economy, and businesses’ opportunities to innovate. The United States will take measures to identify and respond to such actions to help build an international environment that recognizes such acts as unlawful and impermissible, and hold such actors accountable.74\nGiven the foregoing it is not clear whether it is the position of the United States Government that the theft of intellectual property by state actors is currently recognized by the United States government as illegal, pursuant to international law, and that they are working to build on that within the international community. Or, if the United States Government will view this conduct as unlawful (pursuant to international law) once it has been accepted in the “international\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809828\nenvironment”. But, it is clear that it is not in either the short or long-term interests of the United States Government, or any similarly situated government, to allow economic cyber espionage to continue, constrained only by the vague notions of illegality provided by customary law. Because the United States does not spy for its domestic companies,75 it has no ability to engage in tit-for-tat diplomacy; meaning in response to the infiltration of Google’s network, there is no incentive for the United States to undertake a comparable infiltration of Baidu - the dominant Chinese search engine. It is, however, perfectly rational against this factual backdrop, for the United States to seek to advance a normative construct of illegality to constrain the behavior of other state actors. Thus, pushing for a clearer set of norms acts as one tool to attempt to influence the unwanted behaviors of other states.76\nIn this way, traditional notions of customary law or the internationalization of general principles do not adequately describe the contemporary governance mechanisms in place that address cyber espionage. Rather, the governance landscape is comprised of emerging norms of conduct, supported by major international actors, that are pursuing their interests and seeking to constrain the ability of other states to exploit the intellectual property and confidential information of the companies that operate in their territory or are regulated by them. At the same time, many states engage in covert network infiltrations into the networks of companies located in their competitor states for economic, as well as political, reasons. When these activities are exposed, states are careful to distance themselves from the conduct. As noted, this suggests that there is no opinio juris supporting the conduct, that it offends the principle of non-interference, and that there is no competing legal rule changing that. But the story does not stop there.\nAt the international level, states like the United States are pushing to have an explicit norm recognized within the international community that prohibits economic cyber espionage, rather than subsisting on the implied norm against it that comes as part of the principle of non-interference. At the domestic level the majority of states already prohibit the types of network intrusions, data interference and intercepts that form the tools of the cyber espionage trade. But, more importantly, these states also – in some instances – seek to prohibit this conduct extraterritoriality and they do so with a legitimate basis under international law. All of this creates a unique legal position for economic cyber espionage: it is implicitly prohibited under customary international law, with a normative push to make it explicitly prohibited, all while states use municipal law to prohibit the conduct domestically and transnationally. Layered on top of this is the trend toward allowing a more permissive regime for national security and non-economic related acts of cyber espionage.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809828\n# PART IV – CONCLUSIONS\nAt this point in time, it is not entirely clear how the legal rules or norms of conduct will develop within this policy space. It is not surprising that the United States is pushing to create a strong normative and legal framework prohibiting acts of economic cyber espionage, because they have the most to lose and the least to gain from these types of activities. The United States generates major amounts of intellectual property and its firms routinely rely on sensitive and proprietary information in their business practices. At the same time, there is no ability within the United States’ system to translate stolen economic intelligence into an actionable intelligence product, because the United States does not have the ability to convey this stolen information to its domestic companies. After all, if the NSA were to steal the design for a revolutionary hybrid automotive engine from an Asian or European auto manufacturer, who would they give it to: Ford? General Motors? Chrysler? They would be effectively picking winners and losers in the free market economy, something which the United States Government tries not to do. It is also not surprising that the United States would seek a more permissive regime when it comes to security related intelligence, because the United States is widely believed to have the most sophisticated offensive cyber arsenal on the planet.\nHowever, this push to bifurcate the rules – with one set of rules for economically motivated cyber espionage and one set for security related cyber espionage – sets up an interesting problem. The difficulty is that this framework would require target states to understand the motivation behind a particular intrusion in order to accurately gage the legality of that act. It also presupposes that a clear line can be drawn between economic and security interests – which of course is not true. Suppose for example that State A dropped a logic bomb on the central server of the national bank in State B. What if the purpose of this act was to activate the nefarious code only in the event of a kinetic conflict between the two states to undermine the economy within the target state? But, what if the purpose of the logic bomb was solely to undermine consumer confidence in that bank and to push consumer and business investments elsewhere? The act, placing nefarious code on the server, is the exact same. It is only the motivation that differs. And, in cyberspace, it will be difficult if not impossible to accurately assess the motivation behind any particular act. Therefore, the notion of setting up a dual regime with permissive rules for security related espionage and restrictive rules for economic espionage rests on top of two fallacies. First, that a target can tell the difference between acts that are economic in nature versus those that are security related, and that there is an actual difference between the two. And second, that a target will be able to ascertain why a particular clandestine cyber act was undertaken. This bifurcation of espionage related activities is simply not a sustainable way to create realistic rules of the road for espionage in cyber space.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809828"

Many look to state practice, and conclude that acts of espionage must surely be legal because so many states spy on one another.¹ Others say that sending spies in to the territory of another state breaches the norm of territorial and sovereign integrity, and therefore acts of espionage should rightly be considered illegal pursuant to the relevant legal rules.² The difficulty in assessing legality is amplified when analyzing cyber intrusions, because they do not offend the principle of territorial integrity in the same way that sending an actual state agent to gather human intelligence (colloquially referred to as “HUMINT”) would. This paper is an attempt to address these legal ambiguities.\nHowever, because there is no public multilateral treaty that addresses acts of cyber espionage, recourse must be made to the customary rules to determine the position of espionage under international law. At its most basic level, customary law is comprised of the rules that emerge as a matter of past practice amongst nation states, and which come to govern future relations between them. The Statute of the International Court of Justice defines customary law as “evidence of a general practice accepted as law.” This has been interpreted to mean that for a customary norm of conduct to crystallize into a binding rule – gaining formal status under international law – two constituent criteria must be met. First, there must be widespread and consistent state practice. Second, the activity in question, or the abstinence of states from engaging in a particular activity, must be done out of a sense of legal compulsion. This second element, called *opinio juris*, is used to differentiate state actions that are legally obliged from those undertaken for some other purpose (like self-interest or comity).\nThe starting point for the application of international rules is the often cited *Lotus* principle, which asserts that a sovereign state may undertake any action they wish, as long as that action is not explicitly prohibited.³ The relevant question then becomes: Is there an explicit prohibition on acts of cyber espionage? The research goal of this paper is to answer that question, and in answering this question the paper will make three arguments.\nFirst, that despite the fact that states routinely spy on each other, there is no evidence to support the proposition that state actors view cyber espionage as something that is legal under customary\n¹ Geoffrey B.

In this regard, while instances of cyber espionage may not offend the territorial integrity of the target state like human spying would, a sound legal conclusion can be drawn that certain intrusions will offend the principle of non-interference under international law. And, if cyber intrusions offend the principle of non-interference, they are correctly considered to be illegal pursuant to the relevant customary rules.\nSecond, the forces that influence the behavior of both state and non-state actors in relation to cyber espionage are much more complicated than a simple determination of legality. Cyber espionage may be illegal, but this vague notion of illegality pursuant to an even vaguer general rule of customary law acts as an extremely poor constraint on state behaviour. Poorly constrained, it is no surprise that states have engaged in a massive campaign of political, economic and military cyber espionage activities. However, many states view the current situation characterized by widespread (and largely unchecked) acts of cyber espionage as unsustainable. It is the explosion in the number of targets created by the Internet that has led the global community in to a process of what international relations scholars call ‘regime’ building, or what international lawyers call the ‘transnational legal process’. Simply put, the existing rules (both hard and soft) that govern behavior are evolving, and new rules are – or at the very least will be – emerging.\nThird, contemporary regime building efforts driven largely by the United States seem poised to build a bifurcated legal regime separating out economic espionage (aimed at private sector interests) from other more traditional forms (aimed largely at states). The most recent evidence of this came during high-level talks between the United States and China, when it became clear that the agenda of the United States was to establish restrictive prohibitions on economically oriented acts of cyber espionage alongside a more permissive regime for traditional security related espionage. After the first day of talks, an American official said in relation to the theft of intellectual property, “we don’t do it, and we don’t think any country should do it.”⁴ For its part, China does not see a comparable distinction between economic and military security. As an example, the China Daily – a government oriented publication – wrote that “by dividing cyberespionage into ‘bad’ and ‘good’ activities, Washington is trying to dictate the rules for global cyberdomain, which is a public space.”⁵ Thus, it seems clear that the normative ground is shifting. But given the divergent views among two of the main actors, it remains unclear how fast and how far these normative changes will go to actually curbing unwanted state behavior in cyber space.\nIn order to make these arguments, this paper will proceed as follows. Part I will set out the precise content of the norm of non-interference under international law. Part II will examine state practice and opinio juris in relation to cyber espionage through the lens of the 2010 clandestine entry into Google’s servers – termed operation Aurora – arguing that there is no opinio juris to support state practice and that, even when caught, states tend to deny responsibility for acts of cyber espionage. Part III examines the emerging trend toward a more robust regime, which seeks to place greater constraints on the commission of acts of cyber\n⁴ David E.

Finally, Part IV concludes with some recommendations regarding the potential course of evolution in this dynamic area of law.\n## PART I - THE NORM OF NON-INTERFERENCE UNDER INTERNATIONAL LAW AND CYBER ESPIONAGE\nAt its most basic level, the principle of non-interference provides, that “[n]o state has the right to intervene in the internal or external affairs of another.”⁶ This general statement of principle seems to elude precise quantification and the jurisprudence is largely unhelpful in determining with any level of specificity the content of the prohibition on foreign interference. The clearest articulation of the norm from the International Court of Justice is that the principle forbids intervention that has a “bearing on matters in which each State is permitted, by the principle of State sovereignty, to decide freely.”⁷ The utility of this observation is limited by the fact that the modern regulatory state is free to decide almost anything within its territory, and because there is a serious gap between what a broad view of the norm of non-interference would require and what states actually do in their conduct toward one another.⁸ For that reason, determining the content of the norm with precision will require a case-by-case analysis to determine whether the specific conduct in question - in this case cyber espionage - falls within the scope of the prohibition.\nThere have been two broadly supported United Nations General Assembly Resolutions that have some bearing on the scope of the principle. The first is the 1965 the Declaration on the Inadmissibility of Intervention in the Domestic Affairs of States and the Protection of their Independence and Sovereignty (“Declaration on Intervention”).⁹ The second is the 1970 Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States in Accordance with the Charter of the United Nations (“Friendly Relations Declaration”).¹⁰ These two documents are strikingly similar, with only modest differences. The relevant operative paragraph of the Friendly Relations Declaration is slightly more robust, stating:\nNo State or group of States has the right to intervene, directly or indirectly, for any reason whatever, in the internal or external affairs of any other State. Consequently, armed intervention and all other forms of interference or attempted threats against the personality of the State or against its political, economic and cultural elements, are in violation of international law.¹¹\nThus, within the Friendly Relations Declaration, which is widely regarded to reflect customary\nElectronic copy available at: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2809828\n6 Montevideo Convention on the Rights and Duties of States, Dec. 26, 1933, 49 Stat. 3097, TS No. 881, 165 LNTS 19, Art. 8.\n7 Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua (Nicar. v. U.S.), Judgment, 1986 I.C.J. 14, 205 (June 27).\n8 See Lori Fisler Damrosch, *Politics Across Borders: Nonintervention and Nonforcible Influence Over Domestic Affairs*, 83 AM. J.

However, the International Court of Justice narrowed this broad articulation in the Nicaragua decision, noting that:\nA prohibited intervention must accordingly be one bearing on matters in which each State is permitted, by the principle of State sovereignty, to decide freely. One of these is the choice of a political, economic, social and cultural system, and the formulation of foreign policy. Intervention is wrongful when it uses methods of coercion in regard to such choices, which must remain free ones.¹³\nThe problem is that the Court does not go on to define with any level of specificity what the content of the prohibition on interference actually is. The Court indicates that in order to be prohibited under international law an intervention must be one bearing on matters that each State is permitted, by the principle of State sovereignty, to decide freely. Unfortunately, rather than clarifying this position, the Court – curiously – goes on to consider whether there is any customary international law allowing intervention. Thus, the actual content of the norm of non-interference is left ill-defined and extremely vague.\nThe Nicaragua decision is further limited by the fact that it is decided at that outset that the \"Court will define only those aspects of the principle which appear to be relevant to the resolution of the dispute.\"¹⁴ In this respect this case is lacking because, in many ways, the discussion of non-interference/non-intervention is subsumed within the larger discussion of the prohibition on the use of force that is the immediate subject matter of the decision. Therefore, the decision really provides only a partial discussion of the principle of non-interference. The Court explicitly chooses to discuss only those aspects of the principle relevant to the case before it. By definition then, the principle of non-interference goes beyond the narrow articulation presented by the Court. Consequently, states and legal scholars alike were left with only a partial explanation of the rule and with an unfinished legal test to determine which acts will actually offend the rule against foreign interference. What if any relevance does this limited test have for determining if a particular act of cyber espionage will offend the principle against non-interference? The simple answer is not much.\nPursuant to the test for interference posited in the Nicaragua case, in order to fall within the definition of prohibited intervention, the act in question must be intended to force or coerce a change of policy within the victim state. This formulation is not without support in the literature. Russell Buchan recently put forward a rote articulation of this test, in relation to cyber interference. Buchan argues:\nAll in all, in order to establish a violation of the non-intervention principle two questions must be addressed. First, is the intervention intended to force the victim State into a change of policy? [...] Secondly, if the intention to impose coercion is present, it must then be asked whether the application of coercion bears upon matters\n¹² Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua (Nicar. v. U.S.), Judgment, 1986 I.C.J. 14, 202 (June 27) (“The principle of non-intervention involves the right of every sovereign State to conduct its affairs without outside interference; though examples of trespass against this principle are not infrequent, the Court considers that it is part and parcel of customary international law.”).\n¹³ Ibid., 205 (emphasis added).\n¹⁴ Ibid.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809828\nwhich a state is entitled to freely determine itself.¹⁵\nThe problem is that adopting this legal standard would exclude from international regulation all acts of cyber aggression that had no physical (or kinetic) effect,¹⁶ and which were motived by something other than a desire to influence policy within the target state. As an example, in February of 2011 the Internet security firm, McAfee, uncovered a major network infiltration using IP addresses located in China. The intrusion, labeled “Night Dragon”, targeted Western oil and energy companies and “[t]he goal of the intrusions was to obtain information on sensitive competitive proprietary operations and on financing of oil and gas field bids and operations.”¹⁷ In this case, valuable proprietary information was stolen and a significant benefit would have accrued to the relevant Chinese agencies or firms. However, because the objective was to obtain sensitive information and to use it against Chinese competitors, according to the circumspect test of the International Court of Justice in Nicaragua or the analysis put forward by Buchan, this would not qualify as an unlawful intervention or interference. This is because the breach was not intended to change a policy within the victim state.\nThis notion is deeply problematic given that the gravamen of the offence of unlawful interference is intervening in to the sphere over which the target state has authority. States – acting in their capacity as a sovereign – have the ability to regulate telecommunications, Internet service providers, intellectual property rights, and criminal sanctions related to data breaches. The exercise of these rights has nothing to do with the intent of the offending party. Rather, the right itself flows from state sovereignty. It is the intervention within the affairs of a sovereign state that is offensive, regardless of the intent of the intervening party.\nHowever, given the limits of the applicable jurisprudence, all that can really be said about the status of the law is that it remains unclear and ill-suited to address clandestine cyber intrusions. The law is unclear because there is no authoritative decision that unequivocally demarcates the boundaries of an independent right of non-interference. The law is ill-suited to address cyber intrusions, because if a requisite element of the test of non-interference is the requirement to influence policy in the target state, then intrusions that are motivated by some other desire (i.e. economics) and which are meant to remain covert will rarely – if ever – meet this threshold. Employing a purposive (intent based) analysis to determine whether or not a covert cyber entry will offend the principle of non-interference is inappropriate because it sets up an impossible test – how can one ever know what the intention is behind a clandestine network entry?\n¹⁵ Russell Buchan, *Cyber Attacks: Unlawful Uses of Force or Prohibited Interventions?* 2 J. OF CONFLICT &amp; SEC. L. 211, 224-225.\n¹⁶ These would likely be governed under Article 2(4) of the United Nations Charter as a use of force. See Matthew C. Waxman, *Cyber-Attacks and the Use of Force: Back to the Future of Article 2(4)*, 36 YALE J. INT'L L. 421 (“there is considerable momentum among American scholars and policy experts behind the idea that some cyber-attacks ought to fall within Article 2(4)'s prohibition of \"force\" or could constitute an \"armed attack,\" at least insofar as those terms should be interpreted to cover attacks with features and consequences closely resembling conventional military attacks or kinetic force.”).\n¹⁷ See OFFICE OF THE NAT'L COUNTERINTELLIGENCE EXEC., *FOREIGN SPIES STEALING US ECONOMIC SECRETS IN CYBERSPACE: REPORT TO CONGRESS ON FOREIGN ECONOMIC COLLECTION AND INDUSTRIAL ESPIONAGE*, 2009-2011, 5 (2011) [COUNTERINTELLIGENCE REPORT].\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809828\nNotwithstanding these challenges, there is limited support within the literature for the proposition that acts of cyber espionage will offend the principle of non-interference. In this regard, Mary Ellen O'Connell writes:\nJust because a cyber-attack or cyber espionage do not amount to an armed attack does not mean that international law has no law against such wrongs. Interference with a State's economic sphere, air space, maritime space or territorial space, even if not prohibited by treaty is prohibited under the general principle of non-intervention. This is apparent in a number of treaties, UN resolutions and ICJ decisions that condemn coercion, interference or intervention that falls short of the use of force.¹⁸\nEven with this limited scholarly support, the actual content of the norm against cyber interference remains amorphous. Surely the norm would not encompass every mild cyber incident, but it must still protect the customary norm that “every sovereign state [has a right] to conduct its affairs without outside interference.”¹⁹ By definition then, determining which cyber intrusions offend the principle of non-interference and which do not will be an exercise in legal line drawing. Suppose for example that State A plans to infiltrate a functioning nuclear power plant in State B. The purpose is to force B to change a foreign policy position. When B decides not to change its position, A activates previously placed nefarious code, or “logic bomb”,²⁰ and causes a meltdown. This would offend both the prohibition on the use of force and easily offend the principle of non-interference. However, suppose B infiltrates the network of the company that makes the reactor to steal industrial designs, recognizing a major cost savings in the establishment of a domestic nuclear power industry. Would this offend the principle of non-interference? What if B just looks at the designs but does not use them for any purpose?\nThese examples demonstrate a clear need to rearticulate the test for prohibited interference in relation to cyber intrusions, moving away from a test that is based on the intent of the offending party to one based on the potential effect of the intrusion. The principle of non-interference is often said to be a corollary of the principle of state sovereignty.²¹ A corollary is something which is a “proposition that follows from a proven proposition with little or no additional proof; something that naturally flows.”²² In this way, the content of the norm of non-interference should naturally follow the contours of the principle of state sovereignty. Thus, if the intrusion\n¹⁸ Mary Ellen O'Connell, *Cyber Security without Cyber War*, 2 J. OF CONFLICT &amp; SEC.

This is a permissible interpretation of the rule, because as noted above, the International Court of Justice’s previous ruling on the issue dealt with only a narrow application of the norm and only to the extent that was necessary to deal with matters immediately before it in the Nicaragua case.\nIf one adopts this rearticulated effects based test, then covert entry into networks accompanied by the stealing of intellectual property, which undermines confidence in the Internet and telecommunications generally,²³ threatens national security,²⁴ or undermines the financial position or competiveness of domestic companies²⁵ – and the corresponding revenue base of their governments – could potentially offend the principle of non-interference. This would necessarily be subject to the doctrine of de minimis non curat lex, or the idea that the law does not concern itself with trifles. Thus, in order to offend the principle, there should be some significant effect attached to the cyber intrusion. If, these criteria are met, then a reasonable reading of the principle of non-interference as articulated in Declaration on Intervention and the Friendly Relations Declaration, which are considered to be customary law, would recognize these events as prohibited.\nThe main anticipated critique to the conception of a norm of non-interference that that would prohibit these forms of cyber intrusions is that state practice diverges markedly from it. Universally, articles on the law of espionage rely on the fact that many states engage in espionage as a justification for its legality. The thrust of the response is that secret state practice is legally irrelevant. The fact that states hide their behavior reinforces the existence of a prohibition, but more importantly, there is strong authority for the proposition that secret state practice is a deficient and unsatisfactory marker in the establishment of a legal rule, or change in its content.²⁶ According to the International Law Association’s Committee on Formation of Customary (General) International Law, a “secret physical act (e.g. secretly “bugging” diplomatic premises) is probably not an example of the objective element. And if the act is discovered, it probably does not count as State practice unless the State tries to assert that its conduct was legally justified.”²⁷ The very notion of a rule of law presupposes that the rule be public. The United Nation Charter bans secret treaties,²⁸ and the same logic would apply to a\n²³ THE WHITE HOUSE, CYBERSPACE POLICY REVIEW, ASSURING A TRUSTED AND RESILIENT INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE (2009) available at http://www.whitehouse.gov/assets/documents/Cyberspace_Policy_Review_final.pdf (“Other intrusions threaten to damage portions of our critical infrastructure.

There is simply no compelling reason for secret state practice to change the rules of public international law.\n## PART II – CYBER ESPIONAGE AND STATE PRACTICE\nEvaluating state practice in relation to the collection of intelligence from human sources or through signals intercepts is difficult for obvious reasons, not least of which is the fact that these activities are meant to be clandestine. Evaluating the practice of states in relation to espionage committed via the Internet is more difficult still, because not only are the activities clandestine, but there are significant challenges with both technical and legal attribution, and even when breaches are uncovered, in many cases the victims are corporations – not states – and often times they do not report the breaches to their own government.²⁹\nTherefore, employing case study methodology has distinct advantages over generalizations regarding state practice in this area. However, owing to the furtive character of espionage, selecting an appropriate case for study presents its own challenges. The surreptitious infiltration into the Google network discovered in 2010, termed Operation Aurora, was selected for study not only because of its high level of publicity, but also because it provoked a rare public response from the two major governments involved, the United States and China.\nCertainly, there are disadvantages to employing case study methodology as well. More particularly, employing a single case study fails to account for the fact that many governments routinely engage in acts of economic espionage aimed squarely at private actors within competitor states.³⁰ It is also requires generalization from one particular case, involving two state actors, to the wider groups of states. This has significant drawbacks because states do not behave in a uniform fashion, they are not motivated or constrained by the same things, and may take a differing view of a particular act. It is also impossible to ever truly know what is motivating a state to undertake a particular course of action. The fact is that generalizing from one observation is a poor mechanism for understanding the motivations of state behavior in a wider context. However, undertaking a detailed case study analysis of the actual conduct of an\nMedia of Rules, 13 GERMAN L.J. 1508, 1518 (“Following the disastrous experience with secret treaties in the lead up to World War I, and responding to demands for transparency from citizens as democracy expanded, states agreed to prohibit secret treaties in international law.

Nation states and criminals target our government and private sector information networks to gain competitive advantage in the commercial sector.”).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809828\ninfiltration that has been publicly exposed is valuable, notwithstanding its drawbacks. The rare public glimpse into the otherwise murky world of international espionage provides valuable evidence for the evaluation of both state practice and opinio juris regarding these actions.\nWhen evaluating the significance of state practice in relation to customary legal rules and espionage, it is a mistake simply to evaluate the conduct of the state that has engaged in the offensive operations. Rather, when operations are uncovered, the response of the offended government is just as, if not more important. Thus, the Google infiltration provides an uncommon example, where a major corporation publicly disclosed the infiltration first, forcing the governments of both states to respond. For that reason, this section will evaluate not only the conduct attributed to the Chinese government in relation to the infiltration of Google and Operation Aurora, but also the response of the United States Government.\n## 1. The Aurora Exploit\nOn January 12, 2010, David Drummond, Senior Vice-President and Chief Legal Officer of Google publicly disclosed that his company had fallen victim to a major network infiltration. Drummond indicated on the company's official blog, that Google had “detected a highly sophisticated and targeted attack on our corporate infrastructure originating from China that resulted in the theft of intellectual property from Google.”³¹ During their internal investigations into the infiltration, the company determined that at least twenty other large companies in the Internet, finance, technology, media and chemical sectors were also targeted. They also uncovered evidence to suggest that “a primary goal of the attackers was accessing the Gmail accounts of Chinese human rights activists.”³²\nAccording to subsequent investigations undertaken by the Internet security firm, McAfee, Operation Aurora initially targeted an individual user within Google. This individual would then receive a link in either an email or through an instant message that purported to be from a trusted source. Once the targeted user clicked on the link at their computer, they would be directed to a website hosted on servers in Taiwan that contained a malicious JavaScript payload.³³ Once at the nefarious website, the Internet browser program being used to view the website automatically downloaded and executed the malicious program code, which included a zero-day Internet Explorer exploit.³⁴ The exploit then executed the malicious payload, which set up a backdoor³⁵ and the networked computer of the unsuspecting user was then remotely connected to command\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809828\n³¹ David Drummond, *A new approach to China*, GOOGLE: OFFICIAL BLOG (Jan. 12, 2010) http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/01/new-approach-to-china.html\n³² David Drummond, *A new approach to China*, GOOGLE: OFFICIAL BLOG (Jan. 12, 2010) http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/01/new-approach-to-china.html\n³³ In basic terms, JavaScript is computer-coding language employed in numerous popular applications including websites and PDFs.\n³⁴ A zero-day exploit is the term of art among software developers and hackers that refers to a previously unknown vulnerability in a computer application.

It also means that the software developers have had zero days to develop a software “patch” that addresses the vulnerability in question.\n³⁵ When attempting to remotely access a computer there is typically an authentication process, which ensures that the party seeking access is entitled to that access.

They targeted sources of intellectual property, including software configuration management (SCM) systems accessible by the compromised system.”³⁶\nThe methods employed during the exploit seem clear. However, actually attributing that covert network exploitation back to the Chinese Government is a different story. In this respect, one report prepared for the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission by Northrop Grumman Corp stated that:\nThe publicly disclosed evidence linking Chinese state sponsorship to the Google intrusion is compelling but still largely circumstantial. Analysis of the malware by third party specialists identified only a small component of the overall code that clearly had a Chinese pedigree; the information targeted was both Google source code and email accounts reportedly of Chinese human rights activists, suggesting a political as well as economic motivation. The IP addresses for the C2 nodes discovered during the forensic investigation were attributed to a Chinese college that has been linked in the past to alleged state sponsored network exploitation activity.³⁷\nHowever, in a leaked classified cable from the United States Embassy in Beijing, the United States government was informed that “[a] well-placed contact claims that the Chinese government coordinated the recent intrusions of Google systems. According to our contact, the closely held operations were directed at the Politburo Standing Committee level.”³⁸ While according to the same cable, “Another contact claimed a top PRC leader was actively working with Google competitor Baidu against Google.”³⁹ In the world of intelligence gathering, there are few certainties; but this cable is close. Although undated, it seems clear that the United States Government was advised shortly after Operation Aurora, and in no uncertain terms, that the infiltration was directed at the Politburo Standing Committee level. The Politburo Standing Committee consists of the top leadership of the Communist Party of China and is the most powerful decision-making body of the Chinese Government.\n## 2. The Response of the United States Government\nThe response of the United States Government was confusing and watered down. It was confusing because it did not reflect the reality of what the United States Government knew had taken place. It was watered down, because the response morphed over time, from what looked like a strong protest, to a situation where the State Department would not even use the word *demarche*⁴⁰ to classify their response toward the Chinese Government.\n³⁶ MCAFEE LABS AND MCAFEE FOUNDSTONE PROFESSIONAL SERVICES, PROTECTING YOUR CRITICAL ASSETS: LESSONS LEARNED FROM “OPERATION AURORA”, available at http://www.mcafee.com/us/resources/white-papers/wp-protecting-critical-assets.pdf.\n³⁷ BRYAN KREKEL, PATTON ADAMS &amp; GEORGE BAKOS, OCCUPYING THE INFORMATION HIGH GROUND: CHINESE CAPABILITIES FOR COMPUTER NETWORK OPERATIONS AND CYBER ESPIONAGE 99, Prepared for the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission by Northrop Grumman Corp.

We look to the Chinese government for an explanation.”41 Then, merely one day later, Assistant Secretary of State, Phillip Crowley, in response to a question on the Google infiltration stated that: “I wouldn’t say that this is necessarily different than the range of issues that we continue to work on with China.”42 Thus, the official response morphed in less than 24 hours, from one of serious concern regarding the covert infiltration of Google, to one in which this issue was no different, or more important, then the other issues involved in the bilateral relations between the two states.\nThe tone changed again the following day. During the January 14, 2010, press briefing Assistant Secretary of State Crowley stated that “this is – it’s a serious issue on a number of levels. As we have talked about, there are business standards and expectations, international norms that you expect your business partners to live up to. And we have had multiple conversations with China about activity both in this area and more broadly.”43 He then went on to state that: “We [the United States Government] have raised this issue today in saying that we have serious concerns about this and its ramifications.”44\nThen on January 15, 2010, the United States Government decided to issue a diplomatic demarche. During the press briefing, Assistant Secretary of State Crowley stated that: “We will be issuing a formal demarche to the Chinese Government in Beijing on this issue in the coming days, probably early next week. [It] will express our concern for this incident and request information from China as to an explanation of how it happened and what they plan to do about it.”45 Notwithstanding this unambiguous statement regarding the issuance of a demarche, it is important to note that a demarche is simply formal diplomatic representation of a government’s official position. They can be used as a mechanism to protest or object to actions by a foreign government, but do not necessarily imply the illegality of those actions. Certainly a government may use a demarche to register its position that a certain act undertaken by a foreign government contravened international law, but this will depend entirely on the wording of the document.\nStill, there was a significant softening of this position on January 19, 2010. On that day during the press briefing, Assistant Secretary of State Kurt M. Campbell was asked “whether that\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809828\ndemarche has been formally issued over the Google case\".46 Campbell responded that the United States Government has had \"multiple meetings with Chinese authorities\" that they \"take this matter very seriously\" and that \"the whole issue does raise serious concerns.\"47 The language of using a diplomatic demarche had disappeared from the parlance of the State Department; instead now the United States Government was content to ask \"them [the Government of China] for an explanation.\"48 Later that day in a separate briefing, Assistant Secretary of State Crowley was asked \"has that demarche been issued and can you tell us what it says?\". The response was terse: \"Kurt [Assistant Secretary of State Campbell] made clear that he had – he said what he said. I'm not going to go further.\"49\nOn January 21, 2010, Secretary of State Clinton spoke on Internet freedom, and during those remarks, she commented that the \"recent situation involving Google has attracted a great deal of interest. And we look to the Chinese authorities to conduct a thorough review of the cyber intrusions that led Google to make its announcement. And we also look for that investigation and its results to be transparent.\"50 The Secretary made no mention of a demarche or other formal rebuke.\nThen on January 22, 2010 the Washington Post reported that a demarche had already been issued, \"according to a State Department official\".51 However, any ambiguity regarding the issuance of the demarche was removed on January 22, 2010, when Assistant Secretary of State Crowley was pointedly asked \"Did you or did you not issue a demarche?\", his response: \"No. Not yet.\"52 Then on February 19, 2010, Crowley was questioned again about the United States formal diplomatic response to the covert infiltration of Google's network. The question: \"I was just wondering - going back to that Goggle [sic] case, there was the discussion that the U.S. is trying to lodge a formal complaint - a demarche on Goggle [sic]. I'm wondering if that has happened or hasn't, and if not, why not?\" The response:\nMR. CROWLEY: Well, I think the – we have had multiple conversations with Chinese officials on this issue, and that included a direct conversation between Secretary Clinton and Foreign Minister Yang in London late last month. So I think we have satisfied ourselves that the Chinese understand the importance with which we view this issue. We have called on the Chinese to conduct a thorough review of cyber intrusions. And they are obviously in the best\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809828\nposition to evaluate what has and continues to occur within their borders.\nQUESTION: So – but just to follow on that, I mean, if the U.S. Government says it's going to make a formal demarche, then it doesn't, does that mean that there's been a change in the assessment of the situation on the ground?\nMR. CROWLEY: Well, I mean, if – a demarche can be a written statement. It can be a verbal statement. The Secretary directly engaged Foreign Minister Yang on this issue. So if you want to call that a demarche – I think we have done what we set out to do, which is to directly express our concerns at high levels about this activity and to encourage China to investigate it thoroughly.53\nIt seems plain that the position of the United States Government morphs over time. The position fluctuates from a issuing a formal demarche to the Chinese Government in Beijing, which expressed serious concern, to a position where the State Department was unwilling to refer to their actions in those terms, referring instead to “high level talks” and “engagement”. The final softening of the United States’ response came several months after the initial announcement by Google.\nOn March 19, 2010 Secretary of State Clinton was asked: “What has the Chinese Government told you about their investigation? What kind of pressure are you putting on the Chinese Government?”. The response from the Secretary of State was: “Well, specifically, with respect to Google, this is really between Google and China.”54 There was no indication that there was any formal response from the Chinese government related to an investigation or any hint that the Chinese Government had shared a plan to interdict these types of infiltrations.\nFor its part, the United States Congress had a less equivocal response. Senate Resolution 405 was introduced on February 2, 2010. It stated that the Senate: “Condemns the cyber attacks allegedly launched from China against Google and other companies and calls on the government of China to review such cyber intrusions.”55 The Resolution was co-sponsored by senior senators from both parties including Senators McCain, Lieberman, Specter and Feingold. It was considered, and agreed to without amendment and with a preamble by Unanimous Consent.56 The Preamble states, “this attack was one in a series of attempts to exploit security flaws and illegally access computer networks of individuals and institutions through the clandestine installation of phishing and malware technology.”57 Senator Kaufman rose two days later, and said on the Senate Floor, that “[w]ith the passage of this resolution, countries from which such attacks originate or countries which take steps to restrict or monitor the Internet should consider themselves on notice.”58 It is not clear what that notice would say, given the rather weak public response from the State Department and the Executive Branch.\n53 Philip J.

It was widely reported that the National Security Agency, the cryptologic branch of the Department of Defense, entered into a secret agreement with Google after the intrusion. However, the NSA has never officially acknowledged a collaborative relationship with Google, and a recent United States Court of Appeals, District of Columbia Circuit Court decision, has made it clear that no information regarding any alleged agreement will be forthcoming and such an agreement, if it does exist, is exempt from freedom of information laws.^^\n## 3. The Response of the Government of the People's Republic of China\nThe Chinese Government responded forcefully to the accusations made by both Google and the United States Government. In almost perfect Orwellian double-speak, the spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry indicated, in response that: \"It is China's consistent policy to promote the development of internet. China has its own national conditions and cultural traditions. It supervises internet according to law, which is in parallel with the international practice [sic].\"^^ She went on to say that \"Hacking in whatever form and offence of others' privacy is prohibited by law in China. As a major victim of hacking in the world, China believes that the international community should intensify the cooperaion [sic] in jointly combating internet hacking so as to safeguard internet security and protect the privacy of citizens in accordance with law.\"^^ So, the official position of the Government of China was that they were in no way responsible for the clandestine infiltration of Google's networks, and that the acts in question are considered criminal under Chinese domestic law.\nWhen confronted, China fervently denied having any role in the infiltration of Google's network. What makes this denial such meaningful evidence is that the United States Government - and the public through wikileaks - knew that the Chinese Government coordinated the intrusions of Google's systems and that the operation was directed at the Politburo Standing Committee level.^^ While the public protest of the United States Government was weak and somewhat confusing, it certainly would not count as acquiescence toward the practice. However, in the face of this protest the Chinese Government did not seek to justify its conduct using legal argument or by relying on an existing or emerging customary legal rule. Rather, the Chinese Government completely denied the allegations. In fact, in their public response the Chinese Government pushes for more intense international cooperation to combat these occurrences.\nPut another way, there is no evidence of opinio juris surrounding the conduct of the states that engage in acts of economic cyber espionage or in the actions of the states that are victim. There has never been a public case of a state seeking to justify acts of cyber espionage as something that is defensible pursuant to international law. States do not feel compelled as a matter of legal obligation to engage in these acts, nor do states feel compelled to remain silent or acquiesce\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809828\nwhen they fall victim. There is no rule of customary international law that justifies a breach of the principle of non-interference, because there is absolutely no *opinio juris* to support what is – in all reality – a thriving clandestine state practice. And while the response of the United States Government was weaker than one might have expected, the fact is that it was a long way from passive acquiescence toward the conduct.\n## PART III - TRANSNATIONAL LEGALISM AND CYBER GOVERNANCE\nAs the above example shows, the international governance regime surrounding cyber espionage is still in its infancy. As such, simply determining whether these actions are legal or illegal is not enough. Rather, the legal rules and the norms that govern conduct in cyber space are in a period of flux and evolution. In order to understand these changes, one must understand the process of transnational legal evolution. The “[t]ransnational legal process describes the theory and practice of how public and private actors -- nation-states, international organizations, multinational enterprises, non-governmental organizations, and private individuals -- interact in a variety of public and private, domestic and international fora to make, interpret, enforce, and ultimately, internalize rules of transnational law.”63\nIn this way, the lens of transnational legalism provides several distinct advantages over the more traditional binary legal/illegal analysis noted above. It describes the complex and dynamic connection between the formation of norms within the international community and the reception and interpretation of those norms into domestic law and practice, while also providing an account of the influence of domestic norms on the development of international rules. It allows for a better and more complete understanding of the role of non-state actors, which are increasingly central players within the international community; moving away from the strictures of the traditional state centric analytical framework allows for a more holistic understanding of global affairs and has significantly greater descriptive validity – because it can accurately account for the fast moving and multi-faceted transnational interactions in the realm of cyber security generally and cyber espionage.\nIn transnational practice, “repeated interactions among states and a variety of domestic and transnational actors produce interpretations of applicable global norms which can be and are eventually internalized into states’ domestic values and processes.”64 Under transnational legal theory, “various agents of internalization – which include transnational norm entrepreneurs, governmental norm sponsors, transnational issue networks, issue linkages and interpretive communities – can provoke nations to move from grudging compliance to habitual internalized obedience with international rules.”65 Given the foregoing, the value of this theoretical model does not stop at its descriptive validity; rather, it has “both predictive capacity and explanatory\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809828\npower regarding questions of causation.\"66 Transnational legal theory predicts that nations are most likely to comply with international norms if transnational legal processes are “aggressively triggered by other transnational actors in a way that forces interaction in forums capable of generating norms, followed by norm-internalization.”67 This process of “interaction and internalization in turn leads a national government to engage in new modes of interest-recognition and identity-formation in a way that eventually leads the nation-state back into compliance.”68\nWhile it is appropriate to conclude that certain acts of cyber espionage are illegal as a matter of international law, and that there is no countervailing customary norm that provides a legal excuse or justification, it is equally appropriate to conclude that the raging practice of cyber espionage among states means that many have yet to subscribe to the norm and to internalize it in their conduct. Thus, with respect to cyber espionage, the global community is engaged at the earlier stages of the transnational legal process of repeated interaction and interpretation. This ongoing process is further complicated by the fact that there are competing norms being advanced by major actors with conflicting geostrategic interests.\nRecent treaty negotiations aimed at Internet regulation broke down over divergent views over the role of the state in international Internet governance.69 The fault line between the United States and Europe, on the one hand, and a coalition of states led by Russia and China, on the other, has also been exposed in relation to the international norms applicable to information security. In September 2011, the Governments of China, the Russian Federation, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan sent a draft International Code of Conduct for information security to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General.\nUnder the terms of the Code of Conduct, each state voluntarily subscribing to the code pledges: “Not to use information and communications technologies, including networks, to carry out hostile activities or acts of aggression, pose threats to international peace and security”.70 At first blush, by sponsoring the Code of Conduct, it would appear that the Governments of China and Russia are prepared to voluntarily pledge not to use information and communications technologies to carry out hostile activities. Given that states now view network integrity as fundamental to their national security, covert network infiltration and economic cyber espionage is unquestionably a hostile act. Therefore, under the Code of Conduct, Russia and China are prepared to disavow the legitimacy of cyber espionage as a tool of strategic and economic policy. This, however, is completely disingenuous.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809828\nThe fact is that both Russia and China are most persistent collectors of economic intelligence. According to a recent report from the Office of the National Counter Intelligence Executive, “Chinese actors are the world’s most active and persistent perpetrators of economic espionage. US private sector firms and cybersecurity specialists have reported an onslaught of computer network intrusions that have originated in China”.71 While at the same time “Russia’s intelligence services are conducting a range of activities to collect economic information and technology from US targets.”72\nThere are two main reasons that China and Russia engage in such aggressive economic cyber espionage, while at the same time they articulate a norm against it on the international stage. First, as a matter of geostrategic interest, “China and Russia view themselves as strategic competitors of the United States and are the most aggressive collectors of US economic information and technology.”73 Second, as a technical matter, these types of intrusions rarely get detected, and when they do they are notoriously difficult to attribute back to a state actor. As a consequence, Russia and China can act in a way that directly contradicts the norm that they are espousing, because there is a relatively low risk of discovery and attribution. It is not in their immediate interests to comply with that norm – the rewards are too high and the risks too low.\nAt the same time, countries like the United States and the United Kingdom are genuinely advocating for the establishment of, and reliance on, a comparable normative framework. Given the position of the United States as a global leader in intellectual property generation, it is not surprising that they would seek the enablement of a rules based regime that aims to hold the perpetrators of acts economic cyber espionage accountable for those actions. The most clear articulation of the policy of the United States Government toward acts of international economic cyber espionage is found in the May 2011 International Strategy for Cyber Space, signed by President Barack Obama. The International Strategy indicates:\nThe persistent theft of intellectual property, whether by criminals, foreign firms, or state actors working on their behalf, can erode competitiveness in the global economy, and businesses’ opportunities to innovate. The United States will take measures to identify and respond to such actions to help build an international environment that recognizes such acts as unlawful and impermissible, and hold such actors accountable.74\nGiven the foregoing it is not clear whether it is the position of the United States Government that the theft of intellectual property by state actors is currently recognized by the United States government as illegal, pursuant to international law, and that they are working to build on that within the international community. Or, if the United States Government will view this conduct as unlawful (pursuant to international law) once it has been accepted in the “international\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809828\nenvironment”. But, it is clear that it is not in either the short or long-term interests of the United States Government, or any similarly situated government, to allow economic cyber espionage to continue, constrained only by the vague notions of illegality provided by customary law. Because the United States does not spy for its domestic companies,75 it has no ability to engage in tit-for-tat diplomacy; meaning in response to the infiltration of Google’s network, there is no incentive for the United States to undertake a comparable infiltration of Baidu - the dominant Chinese search engine. It is, however, perfectly rational against this factual backdrop, for the United States to seek to advance a normative construct of illegality to constrain the behavior of other state actors. Thus, pushing for a clearer set of norms acts as one tool to attempt to influence the unwanted behaviors of other states.76\nIn this way, traditional notions of customary law or the internationalization of general principles do not adequately describe the contemporary governance mechanisms in place that address cyber espionage. Rather, the governance landscape is comprised of emerging norms of conduct, supported by major international actors, that are pursuing their interests and seeking to constrain the ability of other states to exploit the intellectual property and confidential information of the companies that operate in their territory or are regulated by them. At the same time, many states engage in covert network infiltrations into the networks of companies located in their competitor states for economic, as well as political, reasons. When these activities are exposed, states are careful to distance themselves from the conduct. As noted, this suggests that there is no opinio juris supporting the conduct, that it offends the principle of non-interference, and that there is no competing legal rule changing that. But the story does not stop there.\nAt the international level, states like the United States are pushing to have an explicit norm recognized within the international community that prohibits economic cyber espionage, rather than subsisting on the implied norm against it that comes as part of the principle of non-interference. At the domestic level the majority of states already prohibit the types of network intrusions, data interference and intercepts that form the tools of the cyber espionage trade. But, more importantly, these states also – in some instances – seek to prohibit this conduct extraterritoriality and they do so with a legitimate basis under international law. All of this creates a unique legal position for economic cyber espionage: it is implicitly prohibited under customary international law, with a normative push to make it explicitly prohibited, all while states use municipal law to prohibit the conduct domestically and transnationally. Layered on top of this is the trend toward allowing a more permissive regime for national security and non-economic related acts of cyber espionage.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809828\n# PART IV – CONCLUSIONS\nAt this point in time, it is not entirely clear how the legal rules or norms of conduct will develop within this policy space. It is not surprising that the United States is pushing to create a strong normative and legal framework prohibiting acts of economic cyber espionage, because they have the most to lose and the least to gain from these types of activities. The United States generates major amounts of intellectual property and its firms routinely rely on sensitive and proprietary information in their business practices. At the same time, there is no ability within the United States’ system to translate stolen economic intelligence into an actionable intelligence product, because the United States does not have the ability to convey this stolen information to its domestic companies. After all, if the NSA were to steal the design for a revolutionary hybrid automotive engine from an Asian or European auto manufacturer, who would they give it to: Ford? General Motors? Chrysler? They would be effectively picking winners and losers in the free market economy, something which the United States Government tries not to do. It is also not surprising that the United States would seek a more permissive regime when it comes to security related intelligence, because the United States is widely believed to have the most sophisticated offensive cyber arsenal on the planet.\nHowever, this push to bifurcate the rules – with one set of rules for economically motivated cyber espionage and one set for security related cyber espionage – sets up an interesting problem. The difficulty is that this framework would require target states to understand the motivation behind a particular intrusion in order to accurately gage the legality of that act. It also presupposes that a clear line can be drawn between economic and security interests – which of course is not true. Suppose for example that State A dropped a logic bomb on the central server of the national bank in State B. What if the purpose of this act was to activate the nefarious code only in the event of a kinetic conflict between the two states to undermine the economy within the target state? But, what if the purpose of the logic bomb was solely to undermine consumer confidence in that bank and to push consumer and business investments elsewhere? The act, placing nefarious code on the server, is the exact same. It is only the motivation that differs. And, in cyberspace, it will be difficult if not impossible to accurately assess the motivation behind any particular act. Therefore, the notion of setting up a dual regime with permissive rules for security related espionage and restrictive rules for economic espionage rests on top of two fallacies. First, that a target can tell the difference between acts that are economic in nature versus those that are security related, and that there is an actual difference between the two. And second, that a target will be able to ascertain why a particular clandestine cyber act was undertaken. This bifurcation of espionage related activities is simply not a sustainable way to create realistic rules of the road for espionage in cyber space.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809828"

      "flat_text": "# CYBER ESPIONAGE AND INTERNATIONAL LAW\n## BY AARON SHULL\n## INTRODUCTION\nThe place of espionage under international law is an uneasy one. Many look to state practice, and conclude that acts of espionage must surely be legal because so many states spy on one another.¹ Others say that sending spies in to the territory of another state breaches the norm of territorial and sovereign integrity, and therefore acts of espionage should rightly be considered illegal pursuant to the relevant legal rules.² The difficulty in assessing legality is amplified when analyzing cyber intrusions, because they do not offend the principle of territorial integrity in the same way that sending an actual state agent to gather human intelligence (colloquially referred to as “HUMINT”) would. This paper is an attempt to address these legal ambiguities.\nHowever, because there is no public multilateral treaty that addresses acts of cyber espionage, recourse must be made to the customary rules to determine the position of espionage under international law. At its most basic level, customary law is comprised of the rules that emerge as a matter of past practice amongst nation states, and which come to govern future relations between them. The Statute of the International Court of Justice defines customary law as “evidence of a general practice accepted as law.” This has been interpreted to mean that for a customary norm of conduct to crystallize into a binding rule – gaining formal status under international law – two constituent criteria must be met. First, there must be widespread and consistent state practice. Second, the activity in question, or the abstinence of states from engaging in a particular activity, must be done out of a sense of legal compulsion. This second element, called *opinio juris*, is used to differentiate state actions that are legally obliged from those undertaken for some other purpose (like self-interest or comity).\nThe starting point for the application of international rules is the often cited *Lotus* principle, which asserts that a sovereign state may undertake any action they wish, as long as that action is not explicitly prohibited.³ The relevant question then becomes: Is there an explicit prohibition on acts of cyber espionage? The research goal of this paper is to answer that question, and in answering this question the paper will make three arguments.\nFirst, that despite the fact that states routinely spy on each other, there is no evidence to support the proposition that state actors view cyber espionage as something that is legal under customary\n¹ Geoffrey B.

A) No. 10, p. 28 (The Court distinguishes between cases that are binding as a matter of international law, and those which simply represent an ongoing non-obligatory form of conduct stating that “only if such abstention were based on their being conscious of having a duty to abstain would it be possible to speak of an international custom”).\nElectronic copy available at: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2809828\ninternational law. In this regard, while instances of cyber espionage may not offend the territorial integrity of the target state like human spying would, a sound legal conclusion can be drawn that certain intrusions will offend the principle of non-interference under international law. And, if cyber intrusions offend the principle of non-interference, they are correctly considered to be illegal pursuant to the relevant customary rules.\nSecond, the forces that influence the behavior of both state and non-state actors in relation to cyber espionage are much more complicated than a simple determination of legality. Cyber espionage may be illegal, but this vague notion of illegality pursuant to an even vaguer general rule of customary law acts as an extremely poor constraint on state behaviour. Poorly constrained, it is no surprise that states have engaged in a massive campaign of political, economic and military cyber espionage activities. However, many states view the current situation characterized by widespread (and largely unchecked) acts of cyber espionage as unsustainable. It is the explosion in the number of targets created by the Internet that has led the global community in to a process of what international relations scholars call ‘regime’ building, or what international lawyers call the ‘transnational legal process’. Simply put, the existing rules (both hard and soft) that govern behavior are evolving, and new rules are – or at the very least will be – emerging.\nThird, contemporary regime building efforts driven largely by the United States seem poised to build a bifurcated legal regime separating out economic espionage (aimed at private sector interests) from other more traditional forms (aimed largely at states). The most recent evidence of this came during high-level talks between the United States and China, when it became clear that the agenda of the United States was to establish restrictive prohibitions on economically oriented acts of cyber espionage alongside a more permissive regime for traditional security related espionage. After the first day of talks, an American official said in relation to the theft of intellectual property, “we don’t do it, and we don’t think any country should do it.”⁴ For its part, China does not see a comparable distinction between economic and military security. As an example, the China Daily – a government oriented publication – wrote that “by dividing cyberespionage into ‘bad’ and ‘good’ activities, Washington is trying to dictate the rules for global cyberdomain, which is a public space.”⁵ Thus, it seems clear that the normative ground is shifting. But given the divergent views among two of the main actors, it remains unclear how fast and how far these normative changes will go to actually curbing unwanted state behavior in cyber space.\nIn order to make these arguments, this paper will proceed as follows. Part I will set out the precise content of the norm of non-interference under international law. Part II will examine state practice and opinio juris in relation to cyber espionage through the lens of the 2010 clandestine entry into Google’s servers – termed operation Aurora – arguing that there is no opinio juris to support state practice and that, even when caught, states tend to deny responsibility for acts of cyber espionage. Part III examines the emerging trend toward a more robust regime, which seeks to place greater constraints on the commission of acts of cyber\n⁴ David E.

Finally, Part IV concludes with some recommendations regarding the potential course of evolution in this dynamic area of law.\n## PART I - THE NORM OF NON-INTERFERENCE UNDER INTERNATIONAL LAW AND CYBER ESPIONAGE\nAt its most basic level, the principle of non-interference provides, that “[n]o state has the right to intervene in the internal or external affairs of another.”⁶ This general statement of principle seems to elude precise quantification and the jurisprudence is largely unhelpful in determining with any level of specificity the content of the prohibition on foreign interference. The clearest articulation of the norm from the International Court of Justice is that the principle forbids intervention that has a “bearing on matters in which each State is permitted, by the principle of State sovereignty, to decide freely.”⁷ The utility of this observation is limited by the fact that the modern regulatory state is free to decide almost anything within its territory, and because there is a serious gap between what a broad view of the norm of non-interference would require and what states actually do in their conduct toward one another.⁸ For that reason, determining the content of the norm with precision will require a case-by-case analysis to determine whether the specific conduct in question - in this case cyber espionage - falls within the scope of the prohibition.\nThere have been two broadly supported United Nations General Assembly Resolutions that have some bearing on the scope of the principle. The first is the 1965 the Declaration on the Inadmissibility of Intervention in the Domestic Affairs of States and the Protection of their Independence and Sovereignty (“Declaration on Intervention”).⁹ The second is the 1970 Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States in Accordance with the Charter of the United Nations (“Friendly Relations Declaration”).¹⁰ These two documents are strikingly similar, with only modest differences. The relevant operative paragraph of the Friendly Relations Declaration is slightly more robust, stating:\nNo State or group of States has the right to intervene, directly or indirectly, for any reason whatever, in the internal or external affairs of any other State. Consequently, armed intervention and all other forms of interference or attempted threats against the personality of the State or against its political, economic and cultural elements, are in violation of international law.¹¹\nThus, within the Friendly Relations Declaration, which is widely regarded to reflect customary\nElectronic copy available at: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2809828\n\nlaw,¹² there is an explicit prohibition on any form of interference with the political, economic and cultural elements of another state. However, the International Court of Justice narrowed this broad articulation in the Nicaragua decision, noting that: A prohibited intervention must accordingly be one bearing on matters in which each State is permitted, by the principle of State sovereignty, to decide freely. One of these is the choice of a political, economic, social and cultural system, and the formulation of foreign policy. Intervention is wrongful when it uses methods of coercion in regard to such choices, which must remain free ones.¹³ The problem is that the Court does not go on to define with any level of specificity what the content of the prohibition on interference actually is. The Court indicates that in order to be prohibited under international law an intervention must be one bearing on matters that each State is permitted, by the principle of State sovereignty, to decide freely. Unfortunately, rather than clarifying this position, the Court – curiously – goes on to consider whether there is any customary international law allowing intervention. Thus, the actual content of the norm of non-interference is left ill-defined and extremely vague.\nThe Nicaragua decision is further limited by the fact that it is decided at that outset that the\"Court will define only those aspects of the principle which appear to be relevant to the resolution of the dispute.\"¹⁴ In this respect this case is lacking because, in many ways, the discussion of non-interference/non-intervention is subsumed within the larger discussion of the prohibition on the use of force that is the immediate subject matter of the decision. Therefore, the decision really provides only a partial discussion of the principle of non-interference. The Court explicitly chooses to discuss only those aspects of the principle relevant to the case before it. By definition then, the principle of non-interference goes beyond the narrow articulation presented by the Court. Consequently, states and legal scholars alike were left with only a partial explanation of the rule and with an unfinished legal test to determine which acts will actually offend the rule against foreign interference. What if any relevance does this limited test have for determining if a particular act of cyber espionage will offend the principle against non-interference? The simple answer is not much.\nPursuant to the test for interference posited in the Nicaragua case, in order to fall within the definition of prohibited intervention, the act in question must be intended to force or coerce a change of policy within the victim state. This formulation is not without support in the literature. Russell Buchan recently put forward a rote articulation of this test, in relation to cyber interference. Buchan argues: All in all, in order to establish a violation of the non-intervention principle two questions must be addressed. First, is the intervention intended to force the victim State into a change of policy? [...] Secondly, if the intention to impose coercion is present, it must then be asked whether the application of coercion bears upon matters ¹² Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua (Nicar. v. U.S.), Judgment, 1986 I.C.J. 14, 202 (June 27) (“The principle of non-intervention involves the right of every sovereign State to conduct its affairs without outside interference; though examples of trespass against this principle are not infrequent, the Court considers that it is part and parcel of customary international law.”).\n¹³ Ibid., 205 (emphasis added).\n¹⁴ Ibid.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809828 which a state is entitled to freely determine itself.¹⁵ The problem is that adopting this legal standard would exclude from international regulation all acts of cyber aggression that had no physical (or kinetic) effect,¹⁶ and which were motived by something other than a desire to influence policy within the target state. As an example, in February of 2011 the Internet security firm, McAfee, uncovered a major network infiltration using IP addresses located in China. The intrusion, labeled “Night Dragon”, targeted Western oil and energy companies and “[t]he goal of the intrusions was to obtain information on sensitive competitive proprietary operations and on financing of oil and gas field bids and operations.”¹⁷ In this case, valuable proprietary information was stolen and a significant benefit would have accrued to the relevant Chinese agencies or firms. However, because the objective was to obtain sensitive information and to use it against Chinese competitors, according to the circumspect test of the International Court of Justice in Nicaragua or the analysis put forward by Buchan, this would not qualify as an unlawful intervention or interference. This is because the breach was not intended to change a policy within the victim state.\nThis notion is deeply problematic given that the gravamen of the offence of unlawful interference is intervening in to the sphere over which the target state has authority. States – acting in their capacity as a sovereign – have the ability to regulate telecommunications, Internet service providers, intellectual property rights, and criminal sanctions related to data breaches. The exercise of these rights has nothing to do with the intent of the offending party. Rather, the right itself flows from state sovereignty. It is the intervention within the affairs of a sovereign state that is offensive, regardless of the intent of the intervening party.\nHowever, given the limits of the applicable jurisprudence, all that can really be said about the status of the law is that it remains unclear and ill-suited to address clandestine cyber intrusions. The law is unclear because there is no authoritative decision that unequivocally demarcates the boundaries of an independent right of non-interference. The law is ill-suited to address cyber intrusions, because if a requisite element of the test of non-interference is the requirement to influence policy in the target state, then intrusions that are motivated by some other desire (i.e. economics) and which are meant to remain covert will rarely – if ever – meet this threshold. Employing a purposive (intent based) analysis to determine whether or not a covert cyber entry will offend the principle of non-interference is inappropriate because it sets up an impossible test – how can one ever know what the intention is behind a clandestine network entry?\n¹⁵ Russell Buchan, *Cyber Attacks: Unlawful Uses of Force or Prohibited Interventions?* 2 J. OF CONFLICT &amp; SEC. L. 211, 224-225.\n¹⁶ These would likely be governed under Article 2(4) of the United Nations Charter as a use of force. See Matthew C. Waxman, *Cyber-Attacks and the Use of Force: Back to the Future of Article 2(4)*, 36 YALE J. INT'L L. 421 (“there is considerable momentum among American scholars and policy experts behind the idea that some cyber-attacks ought to fall within Article 2(4)'s prohibition of\"force\"or could constitute an\"armed attack,\"at least insofar as those terms should be interpreted to cover attacks with features and consequences closely resembling conventional military attacks or kinetic force.”).\n¹⁷ See OFFICE OF THE NAT'L COUNTERINTELLIGENCE EXEC., *FOREIGN SPIES STEALING US ECONOMIC SECRETS IN CYBERSPACE: REPORT TO CONGRESS ON FOREIGN ECONOMIC COLLECTION AND INDUSTRIAL ESPIONAGE*, 2009-2011, 5 (2011) [COUNTERINTELLIGENCE REPORT].\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809828 Notwithstanding these challenges, there is limited support within the literature for the proposition that acts of cyber espionage will offend the principle of non-interference. In this regard, Mary Ellen O'Connell writes: Just because a cyber-attack or cyber espionage do not amount to an armed attack does not mean that international law has no law against such wrongs. Interference with a State's economic sphere, air space, maritime space or territorial space, even if not prohibited by treaty is prohibited under the general principle of non-intervention. This is apparent in a number of treaties, UN resolutions and ICJ decisions that condemn coercion, interference or intervention that falls short of the use of force.¹⁸ Even with this limited scholarly support, the actual content of the norm against cyber interference remains amorphous. Surely the norm would not encompass every mild cyber incident, but it must still protect the customary norm that “every sovereign state [has a right] to conduct its affairs without outside interference.”¹⁹ By definition then, determining which cyber intrusions offend the principle of non-interference and which do not will be an exercise in legal line drawing. Suppose for example that State A plans to infiltrate a functioning nuclear power plant in State B. The purpose is to force B to change a foreign policy position. When B decides not to change its position, A activates previously placed nefarious code, or “logic bomb”,²⁰ and causes a meltdown. This would offend both the prohibition on the use of force and easily offend the principle of non-interference. However, suppose B infiltrates the network of the company that makes the reactor to steal industrial designs, recognizing a major cost savings in the establishment of a domestic nuclear power industry. Would this offend the principle of non-interference? What if B just looks at the designs but does not use them for any purpose?\nThese examples demonstrate a clear need to rearticulate the test for prohibited interference in relation to cyber intrusions, moving away from a test that is based on the intent of the offending party to one based on the potential effect of the intrusion. The principle of non-interference is often said to be a corollary of the principle of state sovereignty.²¹ A corollary is something which is a “proposition that follows from a proven proposition with little or no additional proof; something that naturally flows.”²² In this way, the content of the norm of non-interference should naturally follow the contours of the principle of state sovereignty. Thus, if the intrusion ¹⁸ Mary Ellen O'Connell, *Cyber Security without Cyber War*, 2 J. OF CONFLICT &amp; SEC.

This is a permissible interpretation of the rule, because as noted above, the International Court of Justice’s previous ruling on the issue dealt with only a narrow application of the norm and only to the extent that was necessary to deal with matters immediately before it in the Nicaragua case.\nIf one adopts this rearticulated effects based test, then covert entry into networks accompanied by the stealing of intellectual property, which undermines confidence in the Internet and telecommunications generally,²³ threatens national security,²⁴ or undermines the financial position or competiveness of domestic companies²⁵ – and the corresponding revenue base of their governments – could potentially offend the principle of non-interference. This would necessarily be subject to the doctrine of de minimis non curat lex, or the idea that the law does not concern itself with trifles. Thus, in order to offend the principle, there should be some significant effect attached to the cyber intrusion. If, these criteria are met, then a reasonable reading of the principle of non-interference as articulated in Declaration on Intervention and the Friendly Relations Declaration, which are considered to be customary law, would recognize these events as prohibited.\nThe main anticipated critique to the conception of a norm of non-interference that that would prohibit these forms of cyber intrusions is that state practice diverges markedly from it. Universally, articles on the law of espionage rely on the fact that many states engage in espionage as a justification for its legality. The thrust of the response is that secret state practice is legally irrelevant. The fact that states hide their behavior reinforces the existence of a prohibition, but more importantly, there is strong authority for the proposition that secret state practice is a deficient and unsatisfactory marker in the establishment of a legal rule, or change in its content.²⁶ According to the International Law Association’s Committee on Formation of Customary (General) International Law, a “secret physical act (e.g. secretly “bugging” diplomatic premises) is probably not an example of the objective element. And if the act is discovered, it probably does not count as State practice unless the State tries to assert that its conduct was legally justified.”²⁷ The very notion of a rule of law presupposes that the rule be public. The United Nation Charter bans secret treaties,²⁸ and the same logic would apply to a ²³ THE WHITE HOUSE, CYBERSPACE POLICY REVIEW, ASSURING A TRUSTED AND RESILIENT INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE (2009) available at http://www.whitehouse.gov/assets/documents/Cyberspace_Policy_Review_final.pdf (“Other intrusions threaten to damage portions of our critical infrastructure.

There is simply no compelling reason for secret state practice to change the rules of public international law.\n## PART II – CYBER ESPIONAGE AND STATE PRACTICE Evaluating state practice in relation to the collection of intelligence from human sources or through signals intercepts is difficult for obvious reasons, not least of which is the fact that these activities are meant to be clandestine. Evaluating the practice of states in relation to espionage committed via the Internet is more difficult still, because not only are the activities clandestine, but there are significant challenges with both technical and legal attribution, and even when breaches are uncovered, in many cases the victims are corporations – not states – and often times they do not report the breaches to their own government.²⁹ Therefore, employing case study methodology has distinct advantages over generalizations regarding state practice in this area. However, owing to the furtive character of espionage, selecting an appropriate case for study presents its own challenges. The surreptitious infiltration into the Google network discovered in 2010, termed Operation Aurora, was selected for study not only because of its high level of publicity, but also because it provoked a rare public response from the two major governments involved, the United States and China.\nCertainly, there are disadvantages to employing case study methodology as well. More particularly, employing a single case study fails to account for the fact that many governments routinely engage in acts of economic espionage aimed squarely at private actors within competitor states.³⁰ It is also requires generalization from one particular case, involving two state actors, to the wider groups of states. This has significant drawbacks because states do not behave in a uniform fashion, they are not motivated or constrained by the same things, and may take a differing view of a particular act. It is also impossible to ever truly know what is motivating a state to undertake a particular course of action. The fact is that generalizing from one observation is a poor mechanism for understanding the motivations of state behavior in a wider context. However, undertaking a detailed case study analysis of the actual conduct of an Media of Rules, 13 GERMAN L.J. 1508, 1518 (“Following the disastrous experience with secret treaties in the lead up to World War I, and responding to demands for transparency from citizens as democracy expanded, states agreed to prohibit secret treaties in international law.

A company may not want to publicly accuse a corporate rival or foreign government of stealing its secrets from fear of offending potential customers or business partners.”).\n³⁰ See Director of National Intelligence, Annual Threat Assessment of the Intelligence Community for the Senate Armed Services Committee, Statement for the Record, March 10, 2009 at 39-40 (“A growing array of state and non-state adversaries are increasingly targeting—for exploitation and potentially disruption or destruction—our information infrastructure, including the Internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers in critical industries... We assess that a number of nations, including Russia and China, have the technical capabilities to target and disrupt elements of the US information infrastructure and for intelligence collection. Nation states and criminals target our government and private sector information networks to gain competitive advantage in the commercial sector.”).\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809828 infiltration that has been publicly exposed is valuable, notwithstanding its drawbacks. The rare public glimpse into the otherwise murky world of international espionage provides valuable evidence for the evaluation of both state practice and opinio juris regarding these actions.\nWhen evaluating the significance of state practice in relation to customary legal rules and espionage, it is a mistake simply to evaluate the conduct of the state that has engaged in the offensive operations. Rather, when operations are uncovered, the response of the offended government is just as, if not more important. Thus, the Google infiltration provides an uncommon example, where a major corporation publicly disclosed the infiltration first, forcing the governments of both states to respond. For that reason, this section will evaluate not only the conduct attributed to the Chinese government in relation to the infiltration of Google and Operation Aurora, but also the response of the United States Government.\n## 1. The Aurora Exploit On January 12, 2010, David Drummond, Senior Vice-President and Chief Legal Officer of Google publicly disclosed that his company had fallen victim to a major network infiltration. Drummond indicated on the company's official blog, that Google had “detected a highly sophisticated and targeted attack on our corporate infrastructure originating from China that resulted in the theft of intellectual property from Google.”³¹ During their internal investigations into the infiltration, the company determined that at least twenty other large companies in the Internet, finance, technology, media and chemical sectors were also targeted. They also uncovered evidence to suggest that “a primary goal of the attackers was accessing the Gmail accounts of Chinese human rights activists.”³² According to subsequent investigations undertaken by the Internet security firm, McAfee, Operation Aurora initially targeted an individual user within Google. This individual would then receive a link in either an email or through an instant message that purported to be from a trusted source. Once the targeted user clicked on the link at their computer, they would be directed to a website hosted on servers in Taiwan that contained a malicious JavaScript payload.³³ Once at the nefarious website, the Internet browser program being used to view the website automatically downloaded and executed the malicious program code, which included a zero-day Internet Explorer exploit.³⁴ The exploit then executed the malicious payload, which set up a backdoor³⁵ and the networked computer of the unsuspecting user was then remotely connected to command Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809828 ³¹ David Drummond, *A new approach to China*, GOOGLE: OFFICIAL BLOG (Jan. 12, 2010) http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/01/new-approach-to-china.html ³² David Drummond, *A new approach to China*, GOOGLE: OFFICIAL BLOG (Jan. 12, 2010) http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/01/new-approach-to-china.html ³³ In basic terms, JavaScript is computer-coding language employed in numerous popular applications including websites and PDFs.\n³⁴ A zero-day exploit is the term of art among software developers and hackers that refers to a previously unknown vulnerability in a computer application. The use of the term zero-day, is meant to connote that the first attack on the software takes place on “day zero” of vulnerability awareness on the part of the software developer. It also means that the software developers have had zero days to develop a software “patch” that addresses the vulnerability in question.\n³⁵ When attempting to remotely access a computer there is typically an authentication process, which ensures that the party seeking access is entitled to that access. By placing a “back door” on the system, the party seeking access can bypass the normal process of authentication and can have virtually unfettered access to the target system.\nand control servers in Taiwan. Once connected to these command servers the “attackers had complete access to internal systems. They targeted sources of intellectual property, including software configuration management (SCM) systems accessible by the compromised system.”³⁶ The methods employed during the exploit seem clear. However, actually attributing that covert network exploitation back to the Chinese Government is a different story. In this respect, one report prepared for the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission by Northrop Grumman Corp stated that: The publicly disclosed evidence linking Chinese state sponsorship to the Google intrusion is compelling but still largely circumstantial. Analysis of the malware by third party specialists identified only a small component of the overall code that clearly had a Chinese pedigree; the information targeted was both Google source code and email accounts reportedly of Chinese human rights activists, suggesting a political as well as economic motivation. The IP addresses for the C2 nodes discovered during the forensic investigation were attributed to a Chinese college that has been linked in the past to alleged state sponsored network exploitation activity.³⁷ However, in a leaked classified cable from the United States Embassy in Beijing, the United States government was informed that “[a] well-placed contact claims that the Chinese government coordinated the recent intrusions of Google systems. According to our contact, the closely held operations were directed at the Politburo Standing Committee level.”³⁸ While according to the same cable, “Another contact claimed a top PRC leader was actively working with Google competitor Baidu against Google.”³⁹ In the world of intelligence gathering, there are few certainties; but this cable is close. Although undated, it seems clear that the United States Government was advised shortly after Operation Aurora, and in no uncertain terms, that the infiltration was directed at the Politburo Standing Committee level. The Politburo Standing Committee consists of the top leadership of the Communist Party of China and is the most powerful decision-making body of the Chinese Government.\n## 2. The Response of the United States Government The response of the United States Government was confusing and watered down. It was confusing because it did not reflect the reality of what the United States Government knew had taken place. It was watered down, because the response morphed over time, from what looked like a strong protest, to a situation where the State Department would not even use the word *demarche*⁴⁰ to classify their response toward the Chinese Government.\n³⁶ MCAFEE LABS AND MCAFEE FOUNDSTONE PROFESSIONAL SERVICES, PROTECTING YOUR CRITICAL ASSETS: LESSONS LEARNED FROM “OPERATION AURORA”, available at http://www.mcafee.com/us/resources/white-papers/wp-protecting-critical-assets.pdf.\n³⁷ BRYAN KREKEL, PATTON ADAMS &amp; GEORGE BAKOS, OCCUPYING THE INFORMATION HIGH GROUND: CHINESE CAPABILITIES FOR COMPUTER NETWORK OPERATIONS AND CYBER ESPIONAGE 99, Prepared for the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission by Northrop Grumman Corp.

We look to the Chinese government for an explanation.”41 Then, merely one day later, Assistant Secretary of State, Phillip Crowley, in response to a question on the Google infiltration stated that: “I wouldn’t say that this is necessarily different than the range of issues that we continue to work on with China.”42 Thus, the official response morphed in less than 24 hours, from one of serious concern regarding the covert infiltration of Google, to one in which this issue was no different, or more important, then the other issues involved in the bilateral relations between the two states.\nThe tone changed again the following day. During the January 14, 2010, press briefing Assistant Secretary of State Crowley stated that “this is – it’s a serious issue on a number of levels. As we have talked about, there are business standards and expectations, international norms that you expect your business partners to live up to. And we have had multiple conversations with China about activity both in this area and more broadly.”43 He then went on to state that: “We [the United States Government] have raised this issue today in saying that we have serious concerns about this and its ramifications.”44 Then on January 15, 2010, the United States Government decided to issue a diplomatic demarche. During the press briefing, Assistant Secretary of State Crowley stated that: “We will be issuing a formal demarche to the Chinese Government in Beijing on this issue in the coming days, probably early next week. [It] will express our concern for this incident and request information from China as to an explanation of how it happened and what they plan to do about it.”45 Notwithstanding this unambiguous statement regarding the issuance of a demarche, it is important to note that a demarche is simply formal diplomatic representation of a government’s official position. They can be used as a mechanism to protest or object to actions by a foreign government, but do not necessarily imply the illegality of those actions. Certainly a government may use a demarche to register its position that a certain act undertaken by a foreign government contravened international law, but this will depend entirely on the wording of the document.\nStill, there was a significant softening of this position on January 19, 2010. On that day during the press briefing, Assistant Secretary of State Kurt M. Campbell was asked “whether that Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809828 demarche has been formally issued over the Google case\".46 Campbell responded that the United States Government has had\"multiple meetings with Chinese authorities\"that they\"take this matter very seriously\"and that\"the whole issue does raise serious concerns.\"47 The language of using a diplomatic demarche had disappeared from the parlance of the State Department; instead now the United States Government was content to ask\"them [the Government of China] for an explanation.\"48 Later that day in a separate briefing, Assistant Secretary of State Crowley was asked\"has that demarche been issued and can you tell us what it says?\". The response was terse:\"Kurt [Assistant Secretary of State Campbell] made clear that he had – he said what he said. I'm not going to go further.\"49 On January 21, 2010, Secretary of State Clinton spoke on Internet freedom, and during those remarks, she commented that the\"recent situation involving Google has attracted a great deal of interest. And we look to the Chinese authorities to conduct a thorough review of the cyber intrusions that led Google to make its announcement. And we also look for that investigation and its results to be transparent.\"50 The Secretary made no mention of a demarche or other formal rebuke.\nThen on January 22, 2010 the Washington Post reported that a demarche had already been issued,\"according to a State Department official\".51 However, any ambiguity regarding the issuance of the demarche was removed on January 22, 2010, when Assistant Secretary of State Crowley was pointedly asked\"Did you or did you not issue a demarche?\", his response:\"No. Not yet.\"52 Then on February 19, 2010, Crowley was questioned again about the United States formal diplomatic response to the covert infiltration of Google's network. The question:\"I was just wondering - going back to that Goggle [sic] case, there was the discussion that the U.S. is trying to lodge a formal complaint - a demarche on Goggle [sic]. I'm wondering if that has happened or hasn't, and if not, why not?\"The response: MR. CROWLEY: Well, I think the – we have had multiple conversations with Chinese officials on this issue, and that included a direct conversation between Secretary Clinton and Foreign Minister Yang in London late last month. So I think we have satisfied ourselves that the Chinese understand the importance with which we view this issue. We have called on the Chinese to conduct a thorough review of cyber intrusions. And they are obviously in the best Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809828 position to evaluate what has and continues to occur within their borders.\nQUESTION: So – but just to follow on that, I mean, if the U.S. Government says it's going to make a formal demarche, then it doesn't, does that mean that there's been a change in the assessment of the situation on the ground?\nMR. CROWLEY: Well, I mean, if – a demarche can be a written statement. It can be a verbal statement. The Secretary directly engaged Foreign Minister Yang on this issue. So if you want to call that a demarche – I think we have done what we set out to do, which is to directly express our concerns at high levels about this activity and to encourage China to investigate it thoroughly.53 It seems plain that the position of the United States Government morphs over time. The position fluctuates from a issuing a formal demarche to the Chinese Government in Beijing, which expressed serious concern, to a position where the State Department was unwilling to refer to their actions in those terms, referring instead to “high level talks” and “engagement”. The final softening of the United States’ response came several months after the initial announcement by Google.\nOn March 19, 2010 Secretary of State Clinton was asked: “What has the Chinese Government told you about their investigation? What kind of pressure are you putting on the Chinese Government?”. The response from the Secretary of State was: “Well, specifically, with respect to Google, this is really between Google and China.”54 There was no indication that there was any formal response from the Chinese government related to an investigation or any hint that the Chinese Government had shared a plan to interdict these types of infiltrations.\nFor its part, the United States Congress had a less equivocal response. Senate Resolution 405 was introduced on February 2, 2010. It stated that the Senate: “Condemns the cyber attacks allegedly launched from China against Google and other companies and calls on the government of China to review such cyber intrusions.”55 The Resolution was co-sponsored by senior senators from both parties including Senators McCain, Lieberman, Specter and Feingold. It was considered, and agreed to without amendment and with a preamble by Unanimous Consent.56 The Preamble states, “this attack was one in a series of attempts to exploit security flaws and illegally access computer networks of individuals and institutions through the clandestine installation of phishing and malware technology.”57 Senator Kaufman rose two days later, and said on the Senate Floor, that “[w]ith the passage of this resolution, countries from which such attacks originate or countries which take steps to restrict or monitor the Internet should consider themselves on notice.”58 It is not clear what that notice would say, given the rather weak public response from the State Department and the Executive Branch.\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809828 Another branch of the United States Government also got involved in the response. It was widely reported that the National Security Agency, the cryptologic branch of the Department of Defense, entered into a secret agreement with Google after the intrusion. However, the NSA has never officially acknowledged a collaborative relationship with Google, and a recent United States Court of Appeals, District of Columbia Circuit Court decision, has made it clear that no information regarding any alleged agreement will be forthcoming and such an agreement, if it does exist, is exempt from freedom of information laws.^[59]^ ## 3. The Response of the Government of the People's Republic of China The Chinese Government responded forcefully to the accusations made by both Google and the United States Government. In almost perfect Orwellian double-speak, the spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry indicated, in response that:\"It is China's consistent policy to promote the development of internet. China has its own national conditions and cultural traditions. It supervises internet according to law, which is in parallel with the international practice [sic].\"^[60]^ She went on to say that\"Hacking in whatever form and offence of others' privacy is prohibited by law in China. As a major victim of hacking in the world, China believes that the international community should intensify the cooperaion [sic] in jointly combating internet hacking so as to safeguard internet security and protect the privacy of citizens in accordance with law.\"^[61]^ So, the official position of the Government of China was that they were in no way responsible for the clandestine infiltration of Google's networks, and that the acts in question are considered criminal under Chinese domestic law.\nWhen confronted, China fervently denied having any role in the infiltration of Google's network. What makes this denial such meaningful evidence is that the United States Government - and the public through wikileaks - knew that the Chinese Government coordinated the intrusions of Google's systems and that the operation was directed at the Politburo Standing Committee level.^[62]^ While the public protest of the United States Government was weak and somewhat confusing, it certainly would not count as acquiescence toward the practice. However, in the face of this protest the Chinese Government did not seek to justify its conduct using legal argument or by relying on an existing or emerging customary legal rule. Rather, the Chinese Government completely denied the allegations. In fact, in their public response the Chinese Government pushes for more intense international cooperation to combat these occurrences.\nPut another way, there is no evidence of opinio juris surrounding the conduct of the states that engage in acts of economic cyber espionage or in the actions of the states that are victim. There has never been a public case of a state seeking to justify acts of cyber espionage as something that is defensible pursuant to international law. States do not feel compelled as a matter of legal obligation to engage in these acts, nor do states feel compelled to remain silent or acquiesce Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809828 when they fall victim. There is no rule of customary international law that justifies a breach of the principle of non-interference, because there is absolutely no *opinio juris* to support what is – in all reality – a thriving clandestine state practice. And while the response of the United States Government was weaker than one might have expected, the fact is that it was a long way from passive acquiescence toward the conduct.\n## PART III - TRANSNATIONAL LEGALISM AND CYBER GOVERNANCE As the above example shows, the international governance regime surrounding cyber espionage is still in its infancy. As such, simply determining whether these actions are legal or illegal is not enough. Rather, the legal rules and the norms that govern conduct in cyber space are in a period of flux and evolution. In order to understand these changes, one must understand the process of transnational legal evolution. The “[t]ransnational legal process describes the theory and practice of how public and private actors -- nation-states, international organizations, multinational enterprises, non-governmental organizations, and private individuals -- interact in a variety of public and private, domestic and international fora to make, interpret, enforce, and ultimately, internalize rules of transnational law.”63 In this way, the lens of transnational legalism provides several distinct advantages over the more traditional binary legal/illegal analysis noted above. It describes the complex and dynamic connection between the formation of norms within the international community and the reception and interpretation of those norms into domestic law and practice, while also providing an account of the influence of domestic norms on the development of international rules. It allows for a better and more complete understanding of the role of non-state actors, which are increasingly central players within the international community; moving away from the strictures of the traditional state centric analytical framework allows for a more holistic understanding of global affairs and has significantly greater descriptive validity – because it can accurately account for the fast moving and multi-faceted transnational interactions in the realm of cyber security generally and cyber espionage.\nIn transnational practice, “repeated interactions among states and a variety of domestic and transnational actors produce interpretations of applicable global norms which can be and are eventually internalized into states’ domestic values and processes.”64 Under transnational legal theory, “various agents of internalization – which include transnational norm entrepreneurs, governmental norm sponsors, transnational issue networks, issue linkages and interpretive communities – can provoke nations to move from grudging compliance to habitual internalized obedience with international rules.”65 Given the foregoing, the value of this theoretical model does not stop at its descriptive validity; rather, it has “both predictive capacity and explanatory Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809828 power regarding questions of causation.\"66 Transnational legal theory predicts that nations are most likely to comply with international norms if transnational legal processes are “aggressively triggered by other transnational actors in a way that forces interaction in forums capable of generating norms, followed by norm-internalization.”67 This process of “interaction and internalization in turn leads a national government to engage in new modes of interest-recognition and identity-formation in a way that eventually leads the nation-state back into compliance.”68 While it is appropriate to conclude that certain acts of cyber espionage are illegal as a matter of international law, and that there is no countervailing customary norm that provides a legal excuse or justification, it is equally appropriate to conclude that the raging practice of cyber espionage among states means that many have yet to subscribe to the norm and to internalize it in their conduct. Thus, with respect to cyber espionage, the global community is engaged at the earlier stages of the transnational legal process of repeated interaction and interpretation. This ongoing process is further complicated by the fact that there are competing norms being advanced by major actors with conflicting geostrategic interests.\nRecent treaty negotiations aimed at Internet regulation broke down over divergent views over the role of the state in international Internet governance.69 The fault line between the United States and Europe, on the one hand, and a coalition of states led by Russia and China, on the other, has also been exposed in relation to the international norms applicable to information security. In September 2011, the Governments of China, the Russian Federation, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan sent a draft International Code of Conduct for information security to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General.\nUnder the terms of the Code of Conduct, each state voluntarily subscribing to the code pledges: “Not to use information and communications technologies, including networks, to carry out hostile activities or acts of aggression, pose threats to international peace and security”.70 At first blush, by sponsoring the Code of Conduct, it would appear that the Governments of China and Russia are prepared to voluntarily pledge not to use information and communications technologies to carry out hostile activities. Given that states now view network integrity as fundamental to their national security, covert network infiltration and economic cyber espionage is unquestionably a hostile act. Therefore, under the Code of Conduct, Russia and China are prepared to disavow the legitimacy of cyber espionage as a tool of strategic and economic policy. This, however, is completely disingenuous.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809828 The fact is that both Russia and China are most persistent collectors of economic intelligence. According to a recent report from the Office of the National Counter Intelligence Executive, “Chinese actors are the world’s most active and persistent perpetrators of economic espionage. US private sector firms and cybersecurity specialists have reported an onslaught of computer network intrusions that have originated in China”.71 While at the same time “Russia’s intelligence services are conducting a range of activities to collect economic information and technology from US targets.”72 There are two main reasons that China and Russia engage in such aggressive economic cyber espionage, while at the same time they articulate a norm against it on the international stage. First, as a matter of geostrategic interest, “China and Russia view themselves as strategic competitors of the United States and are the most aggressive collectors of US economic information and technology.”73 Second, as a technical matter, these types of intrusions rarely get detected, and when they do they are notoriously difficult to attribute back to a state actor. As a consequence, Russia and China can act in a way that directly contradicts the norm that they are espousing, because there is a relatively low risk of discovery and attribution. It is not in their immediate interests to comply with that norm – the rewards are too high and the risks too low.\nAt the same time, countries like the United States and the United Kingdom are genuinely advocating for the establishment of, and reliance on, a comparable normative framework. Given the position of the United States as a global leader in intellectual property generation, it is not surprising that they would seek the enablement of a rules based regime that aims to hold the perpetrators of acts economic cyber espionage accountable for those actions. The most clear articulation of the policy of the United States Government toward acts of international economic cyber espionage is found in the May 2011 International Strategy for Cyber Space, signed by President Barack Obama. The International Strategy indicates: The persistent theft of intellectual property, whether by criminals, foreign firms, or state actors working on their behalf, can erode competitiveness in the global economy, and businesses’ opportunities to innovate. The United States will take measures to identify and respond to such actions to help build an international environment that recognizes such acts as unlawful and impermissible, and hold such actors accountable.74 Given the foregoing it is not clear whether it is the position of the United States Government that the theft of intellectual property by state actors is currently recognized by the United States government as illegal, pursuant to international law, and that they are working to build on that within the international community. Or, if the United States Government will view this conduct as unlawful (pursuant to international law) once it has been accepted in the “international Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809828 environment”. But, it is clear that it is not in either the short or long-term interests of the United States Government, or any similarly situated government, to allow economic cyber espionage to continue, constrained only by the vague notions of illegality provided by customary law. Because the United States does not spy for its domestic companies,75 it has no ability to engage in tit-for-tat diplomacy; meaning in response to the infiltration of Google’s network, there is no incentive for the United States to undertake a comparable infiltration of Baidu - the dominant Chinese search engine. It is, however, perfectly rational against this factual backdrop, for the United States to seek to advance a normative construct of illegality to constrain the behavior of other state actors. Thus, pushing for a clearer set of norms acts as one tool to attempt to influence the unwanted behaviors of other states.76 In this way, traditional notions of customary law or the internationalization of general principles do not adequately describe the contemporary governance mechanisms in place that address cyber espionage. Rather, the governance landscape is comprised of emerging norms of conduct, supported by major international actors, that are pursuing their interests and seeking to constrain the ability of other states to exploit the intellectual property and confidential information of the companies that operate in their territory or are regulated by them. At the same time, many states engage in covert network infiltrations into the networks of companies located in their competitor states for economic, as well as political, reasons. When these activities are exposed, states are careful to distance themselves from the conduct. As noted, this suggests that there is no opinio juris supporting the conduct, that it offends the principle of non-interference, and that there is no competing legal rule changing that. But the story does not stop there.\nAt the international level, states like the United States are pushing to have an explicit norm recognized within the international community that prohibits economic cyber espionage, rather than subsisting on the implied norm against it that comes as part of the principle of non-interference. At the domestic level the majority of states already prohibit the types of network intrusions, data interference and intercepts that form the tools of the cyber espionage trade. But, more importantly, these states also – in some instances – seek to prohibit this conduct extraterritoriality and they do so with a legitimate basis under international law. All of this creates a unique legal position for economic cyber espionage: it is implicitly prohibited under customary international law, with a normative push to make it explicitly prohibited, all while states use municipal law to prohibit the conduct domestically and transnationally. Layered on top of this is the trend toward allowing a more permissive regime for national security and non-economic related acts of cyber espionage.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809828 # PART IV – CONCLUSIONS At this point in time, it is not entirely clear how the legal rules or norms of conduct will develop within this policy space. It is not surprising that the United States is pushing to create a strong normative and legal framework prohibiting acts of economic cyber espionage, because they have the most to lose and the least to gain from these types of activities. The United States generates major amounts of intellectual property and its firms routinely rely on sensitive and proprietary information in their business practices. At the same time, there is no ability within the United States’ system to translate stolen economic intelligence into an actionable intelligence product, because the United States does not have the ability to convey this stolen information to its domestic companies. After all, if the NSA were to steal the design for a revolutionary hybrid automotive engine from an Asian or European auto manufacturer, who would they give it to: Ford? General Motors? Chrysler? They would be effectively picking winners and losers in the free market economy, something which the United States Government tries not to do. It is also not surprising that the United States would seek a more permissive regime when it comes to security related intelligence, because the United States is widely believed to have the most sophisticated offensive cyber arsenal on the planet.\nHowever, this push to bifurcate the rules – with one set of rules for economically motivated cyber espionage and one set for security related cyber espionage – sets up an interesting problem. The difficulty is that this framework would require target states to understand the motivation behind a particular intrusion in order to accurately gage the legality of that act. It also presupposes that a clear line can be drawn between economic and security interests – which of course is not true. Suppose for example that State A dropped a logic bomb on the central server of the national bank in State B. What if the purpose of this act was to activate the nefarious code only in the event of a kinetic conflict between the two states to undermine the economy within the target state? But, what if the purpose of the logic bomb was solely to undermine consumer confidence in that bank and to push consumer and business investments elsewhere? The act, placing nefarious code on the server, is the exact same. It is only the motivation that differs. And, in cyberspace, it will be difficult if not impossible to accurately assess the motivation behind any particular act. Therefore, the notion of setting up a dual regime with permissive rules for security related espionage and restrictive rules for economic espionage rests on top of two fallacies. First, that a target can tell the difference between acts that are economic in nature versus those that are security related, and that there is an actual difference between the two. And second, that a target will be able to ascertain why a particular clandestine cyber act was undertaken. This bifurcation of espionage related activities is simply not a sustainable way to create realistic rules of the road for espionage in cyber space.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2809828"
