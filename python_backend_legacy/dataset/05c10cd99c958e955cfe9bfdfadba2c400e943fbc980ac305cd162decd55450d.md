However, despite its practical importance, the principle of precautions seems to trail behind the other two concepts.¹ This negligence extends not only to scholarly works but also to military doctrines. While the first two principles are often referred to as ‘principles’ in military manuals, the third does not have such a privilege.² Nonetheless, it not only confirms or supplements these former principles but also prescribes some preliminary measures to avoid violating them.³\nOn the other hand, the Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC) rules, which regulate the application of the principle of precautions, were designed to be applied during conventional warfare. Due to the interconnected nature of the cyber domain, however, it is difficult to apply these rules to cyber operations. Before discussing the complexity posed by the interconnectivity of cyberspace, it should be admitted that it is not unique to the cyber domain; traditional domains have this problem too. Almost half a century ago, the reality that there is ‘a geographical and functional mixture of combatants and civilians and military objectives and civilian objects’ in the conduct of military air\n1.

From the first standpoint, technical factors intensify the interconnectedness between military and civilian networks in cyberspace, therefore converting this domain into one of entirely dual-use nature and obstructing the distinction between military targets and civilian objects. As Jensen points out, ‘[w]ith 98% of day-to-day government communications routinely travelling over civilian communication lines, there will be many civilian lines of communication that will carry targetable electronic traffic intermixed with civilian traffic’.⁶ From this vantage point, not only is it highly difficult to make a certain distinction between civilian and military cyber infrastructures, but practically all military cyber activities must be carried out through dual-use cyber systems.⁷ In the absence of precautionary measures against such interconnectivity, the impacts of cyber activities might quickly spread to other systems across the globe and have the potential to significantly disrupt daily civilian life by having adverse impacts on civilian critical infrastructure and other associated systems.⁸ From this point of view, a cyber operation designed to disrupt a dual-used power plant located in a belligerent state could easily impair other systems, from water and food to ICT infrastructure, and its unintended effects might spill over into neutral countries.⁹\nFrom the second point of view, interconnection becomes a more complicated matter when social factors are considered. Even though they are less obvious than technical ones, they still pose threats comparable to those of the latter, and it necessitates especially defensive parties to take unique precautionary measures. Therefore, it has been\n4. US Department of the Air Force, AF Pamphlet 110-31: International Law – The Conduct of Armed Conflict and Air Operations (1976) 5–10.\n5.

This perspective would reveal just how many components are connected and demonstrate the levels of complexity in a facility’.¹⁰ This entails that the human workforce of a facility needs to be considered in terms of the complexity of the system’s network. When this fact about a single facility is considered along with the global challenge of interconnectivity, the magnitude of the interconnectivity issue could be better understood.\nGiven that measures to prevent adversarial effects on cyber systems cannot keep up with their level of interconnectivity,¹¹ this article aims to portray how to apply the principle of precautions to cyber operations and answers this question by taking its humanity-based character into account. The present author acknowledges that the articles articulating the principle of precautions are vague, as stated by state delegates during the negotiations of Additional Protocol-I or by state legal advisers.¹² Such views on specific provisions of the article or the article as a whole are expressed using terms like ‘open to a variety of interpretations by the conflicting parties’¹³ (for Article 57(2)(a)(ii)), ‘subjective’¹⁴ ‘ambiguous’¹⁵ (for Article 57(2)(a)), ‘deficient in clarity due to its generally vague wording’¹⁶ (for Article 57), and ‘too general’¹⁷ (for articles between 48 and 58). Moreover, delegates emphasized the hardships posed by applying these provisions in practice.¹⁸ When the complexity of cyberspace interconnectivity is combined with the ambiguity of the articles, applying the principle of precautions appears to bring together two ‘unknown unknowns’ in order to reach one ‘known known’.¹⁹ Throughout this piece of research, the author attempts to emphasize the humanity-based character of the principle of precautions in order to convert this ambiguity into a flexibility to apply the rules more effectively.²⁰\nThe LOAC, in general, aims to achieve a balance between military necessity and humanity.²¹ From this perspective, it is accepted that some harm will occur; on the\n10.

For example, Sari and Tinkler think that achieving a balance between humanity and necessity in the conduct of hostilities can be held ‘as the object and purpose of Additional Protocol I\n© 2023 The Author\nJournal compilation © 2023 Edward Elgar Publishing Ltd\nDownloaded from https://www.elgaronline.com/ at 07/16/2025 08:36:46PM\nvia University College London (UCL)\nThe application of the principle of precautions to cyber operations 7\nother hand, it should be minimized as much as possible. In other words, ‘[t]he thrust is not absolute elimination of the calamities of war (a goal which would manifestly be utopian), but relief from the tribulations of war “as much as possible” bearing in mind that war is fought to be won’.²² At this point, it sounds rational that these two notions should be balanced while applying the principles governing the conduct of hostilities.\nOn the other hand, considering the peculiarity of interconnectedness in cyberspace, this balance should be leaned toward humanity while applying the principle of precautions. There are some reasons in favour of such an interpretation. To begin with, the notion of ‘balance’ is significantly subjective.²³ From a practitioner perspective, when the armed conflict starts, reality does not permit such a compromise,²⁴ and the perception of ‘balance’ is determined by those on the battlefield. However, outside of the conflict, such a balance could be perceived differently by scholars or judges who need to evaluate the legality of such actions, and their views seem more ‘humanitarian’ to practitioners. As stated by Luban, ‘[f]or military lawyers, the starting point is military necessity, and the reigning assumption is that legal regulation of war must accommodate military necessity. For humanitarian lawyers, the starting point is human dignity and human rights’.²⁵ As a result, such disparities in viewpoints considerably alter the perception of balance, and trying to achieve a balance in the principle of precautions seems to be a rhetorical word.\nApart from the subjectivity of balance depending on different perceptors, the nature of the LOAC principles inherently provides a lean toward either military necessity or humanity.²⁶ While the principles of distinction and proportionality are more eligible to\nmore generally’. See A Sari and K Tinkler, ‘Collateral Damage and the Enemy’ (2019) British Yearbook of International Law 63. From the standpoint of this article, military necessity is held as a permission giving to a belligerent party in order to ‘apply any amount and kind of force to compel the complete submission of the enemy with the least possible expenditure of time, life, and money’ by not violating the LOAC. See The Hostage Case, Case No. 7 (United States v. Wilhelm List et al.), (Opinion and Judgment and Sentence) [1949] 1253 (‘The Hostage Case’). Pictet defines humanity as ‘a sentiment of active goodwill towards mankind’ by referring to Littré’s dictionary. See J Pictet, The Fundamental Principles of the Red Cross (1956) 143. By considering this definition, this article holds the principle of humanity as a ‘guiding principle that puts a brake on undertakings which might otherwise be justified by the principle of military necessity’.

The crux of the former principles is based on gaining military advantage on the battlefield,²⁷ and the notion of military advantage ‘has a particular resonance with “military necessity”’.²⁸ This naturally bends those principles’ interpretation in the direction of military necessity.²⁹ On the other hand, the central tenet of the principle of precautions is based on the minimization of civilian harm. It obliges belligerent parties to take active or passive precautionary measures to mitigate risks, which derive from military operations, towards civilians and civilian property in armed conflicts.³⁰ In line with this, it is not good enough for soldiers ‘merely not intending civilian harm’, but they also ‘must intend not to harm civilians’.³¹\nGiven that the nature of the principles requires that they be construed by leaning towards one side, analyzing the principle of precautions by considering the balance poses a risk that it turns into an ‘illusory rule’. According to Schwarzenberger:\n[Illusory rules]... are merely a formal compromise between the standard of civilization and the necessities of war. Here, in fact the rule of force is supreme. Rules which expressly proclaim the necessities of war as an overriding constituent element or are emasculated by an ‘as far as possible’ clause illustrate this perhaps slightly hypocritical variant of the rules of warfare.³²\nThus, by turning the principle into an ‘illusory rule’, it would be very easy for belligerent parties to refrain from effectively applying the principle of precautions by putting terms such as ‘feasible’ or ‘unless circumstances do not permit’ on the table.³³ To preclude such excuses, one should hold it as a rule that ‘sets limitations to warfare in cases in which considerations of civilization demand priority over military interest’.³⁴ As correctly held by the Madagascar delegate, ‘[t]he article reflected a laudable desire to narrow the gap between the ideal and the possible, and to deal from a humanitarian standpoint with two opposite positions, namely, the aggressor’s and the victim’s’.³⁵ Per this point of view, the application of the principle of precautions by taking ‘one small step’ toward humanity could be ‘one giant leap’ toward a more appropriate\n²⁷.

When the inherent bending of these principles toward military necessity and only their recognition as ‘principles’ in military manuals are considered, the consequence is admitted by Maurer that ‘[i]n more than one context, the balance between military “necessity” and protection concerns has heavily tilted towards military logics, and norms have been implicitly downgraded to mere discretionary guidance’.

In section 3, the precautions that shall be taken by the attacking side of the conflict according to Article 57 of Additional Protocol-I will be examined. In the first part of the section, target verification in cyber operations will be discussed, and some important questions will be answered, e.g., does technical superiority play any role on the precautionary level? Or what is the requisite level of certainty? In the second part, the choice of cyber means and methods will be addressed. The proportionality rule in precautions in planning and executing cyber attacks will be determined in the third part. Not only will key terms such as ‘military advantage’ and ‘incidental harm’ be discussed in that section, but also some grey areas, e.g., the consideration of indirect effects. The fourth part will explain effective warning before launching cyber attacks, and the final part will explain the least-danger rule. In the fourth section, precautions that shall be taken by a party that is subject to cyber operations will be addressed. In this chapter, the segregation of civilian and military objectives in cyberspace, the location of cyber military objectives, and other measures will be questioned, respectively.\n## 2 THE REGULATION OF THE PRINCIPLE OF PRECAUTIONS, BASIC TERMS AND RESPONSIBILITY\n### 2.1 The regulation of the principle of precautions\nWhile it is not stated conspicuously, the first implication of the principle of precautions can be found in Article 27 of the Hague Convention IV, in which it is stated that:\nIn sieges and bombardments all necessary steps must be taken to spare, as far as possible, buildings dedicated to religion, art, science, or charitable purposes, historic monuments, hospitals, and places where the sick and wounded are collected, provided they are not being used at the time for military purposes.³⁷\nIn the following process, the prohibition to launch an attack against civilians and to spare them as much as possible found a place in various official documents.³⁸ However, the first binding regulation of the principle of precautions appeared in the AP-I,\n³⁶. ‘The principles of distinction, precautions and proportionality thus complement each other in a way that achieves a subtle balance between military necessity and humanitarian imperatives.’ See Sari and Tinkler (fn 21) 4.\n³⁷.

See League of Nations Res ‘Protection of Civilian Populations Against Bombing from the Air in Case of War’ (30 September 1938). Later, more detailed rules were articulated in Articles 8, 9 and 11 of the Draft Rules for the Limitation of the Dangers incurred by the Civilian Population in Time of War (1956). Despite the fact that states did not adopt these rules, they had an impact on the rules codified in Additional Protocols. See S Watts, ‘Law-of-War Precautions: A Cautionary Note’ in RTP Alcala and E Talbot Jensen (eds), The Impact of Emerging Technologies on the Law of Armed Conflict (Oxford University Press, 2019) 116.\n© 2023 The Author\nJournal compilation © 2023 Edward Elgar Publishing Ltd\nDownloaded from https://www.elgaronline.com/ at 07/16/2025 08:36:46PM via University College London (UCL)\nThe Military Law and the Law of War Review, Vol. 61 No. 1\nin which it is stated that both attacking and defending parties shall take precautions to spare civilians and civilian objects in an armed conflict. At this point, for *jus in bello* cyberspace operations, the principle of precautions provides a twofold protection: the first comprises taking constant care while conducting cyber attacks ('precautions in attack'), and the second comprises taking feasible precautions in order to protect civilians from the effects of cyber attacks ('precautions against the effects of attacks') during armed conflicts. These precautions can also be named 'active' and 'passive' precautions ruled under Articles 57 and 58 of the AP-I.\nThe rules stated in Articles 57 and 58 are applied in times of armed conflicts, though the definition of 'armed conflict' is not provided in the Protocol. In this article, the definition given in the Tadic Decision, in which it was described as 'a resort to armed force between States or protracted armed violence between governmental authorities and organized armed groups or between such groups within a State',[39] is adopted. From this definition, it can be stated that there are two types of armed conflicts; 'between States' (international armed conflicts), and 'between governmental authorities and organized armed groups or between such groups' (non-international armed conflicts). In identifying the nature of the conflict, the status of the actors is the decisive factor.[40] The importance of this distinction is that while the AP-I, which is applicable to international armed conflicts, clearly states the obligation to take precautions, there is no clear provision which regulates the principle of precautions in Additional Protocol-II,[41] which is applicable to non-international armed conflicts. However, it does not prevent the application of the principle to the latter type of conflicts since it is stated in Article 13(1) of the AP-II that '[t]he civilian population and individual civilians shall enjoy general protection against the dangers arising from military operations'. Therefore, it is argued in the work of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) on Customary Rules that, by approving the customary nature of the principle for both international and non-international armed conflict, it is hard to abide by such a rule without taking any precaution.[42] Moreover, it is stated in the Tadic Decision that 'all necessary precautions should be taken to avoid injury, loss or damage to civilian populations' in all kinds of armed conflicts by referring to a resolution adopted by the United Nations General Assembly.[43] Finally, two recent treaties that are applicable to non-international armed conflicts explicitly regulate the principle of precautions.[44]\n39.

To solve this problem, one should deem Article 57(4) as ‘merely a restatement of one of the existing rules’.⁴⁶ As Article 49(3) makes clear, the article does not affect those rules that are customary in nature and applicable to all types of military operations. Therefore, Article 57(4) does not contradict but rather ‘complement’ it.⁴⁷\nSince the principle of precautions applies to both operations and attacks, both of these terms should be clarified. At this point, military operations are ‘any movements, manoeuvres and other activities whatsoever carried out by the armed forces with a view to combat’.⁴⁸ Therefore, all parties to the conflict should exercise constant care while conducting their military operations. For instance, if a tank driver harms civilian property while maneuvering the vehicle, he/she will be responsible due to the breach of the principle of precautions.⁴⁹ From this perspective, if a perpetrator destroys a civilian network while conducting cyber exploitation against either a civilian or military cyber system, he/she will bear responsibility. However, military attacks require a certain threshold since they are violent acts causing death, injury, damage, or destruction – or at least intending to do so.⁵⁰ As a result, all military attacks are kinds of military operations but vice versa would not be true. Therefore, while cyber operation can be defined as ‘the employment of cyber capabilities to achieve objectives in or through cyberspace’,⁵¹ cyber attack is ‘a cyber operation, whether offensive or defensive, that is reasonably expected to cause injury or death to persons or damage or destruction to objects’.⁵² In light of this, cyber attack is a special kind of cyber operation that results in violent effects. However, cyber attacks require a broader understanding because damage to objects may occur as a secondary effect of cyber operations. Therefore, the present author agrees with the approach of the majority of the International Group of Experts (the Experts), who prepared the Tallinn Manual, that cyber operations that result in the replacement of a component by having an impact on the functionality of an object fall within the ambit of attack because, while these kinds of operations do not damage an object in the first instance, their effects in later phases reach the threshold of attack by causing physical harm.⁵³\n⁴⁵.

At this point, the applicability of international law to cyber operations is recognized by states and international organizations.⁵⁵ Also, there is a certain difference between a cyber operation and an attack, and not all precautionary measures are applicable to all kinds of cyber operations.\n## 2.2 Constant care\nAccording to Article 57(1) of the AP-I, the attacking party shall always take ‘constant care’ to spare civilians and civilian objects while conducting military operations. The term ‘constant care’ is clarified in the HPCR Manual Commentary by stating that ‘there are no exceptions from the duty to seek to spare the civilian population, civilians and civilian objects’.⁵⁶ Therefore, constant care obliges all levels of the armed forces who are responsible for planning, ordering or executing a cyber operation to always consider the results of it and try to minimize its effects on civilians.⁵⁷\nThe ‘constant care’ obligation is necessary for cyber operations. Those who are involved in the operation should always be aware of the foreseeable effects of operations on the civilian population and property and try to minimize these effects as much as possible. For this reason, it is not enough to demonstrate due care in the planning stage; this obligation extends to all stages of the operation in which civilians might be affected. In other words, these people should have ‘situational awareness at all times’.⁵⁸ The concept of situational awareness is explained in the Allied Joint Doctrine for Cyberspace Operations by describing it as ‘a combination of a near real-time updated RCP [Recognised Cyberspace Picture], analysis and information management’.⁵⁹ Although the obligation is constrained by the execution stage of an operation as described in the article, the effects of the attack can continue.

If the effects of the operation on civilians are not excessive compared to the anticipated military advantage, then the attacking party may continue to carry out cyber operations. However, the calculation may be difficult because of the time-sensitivity. Planned operations give more chance to the attacking party to take better precautions, though time-sensitive ones generally do not permit sufficient time to implement more suitable precautions.⁶³ Although the impact of such a condition on precautions is not deniable, it does not give permission to the attacker to deviate from the principle because the constant care obligation necessitates parties to take feasible precautions in all circumstances.⁶⁴\nThe second significant hurdle might be the secretive nature of cyberspace since ambiguity is at the centre of cyber warfare.⁶⁵ Even though attribution may be difficult in that domain and the perpetrator of cyber acts that violate the LOAC cannot be easily found, parties to the conflict should obey the rules of the LOAC by considering warrior ethics. From this perspective, cyber warriors should always seek ways to mitigate risks towards civilians in good faith since ‘[r]espect for LOAC obligations is the essential touchstone for that ethical foundation’.⁶⁶ This ethical foundation serves for better protection of civilians, which is an inherent objective of the LOAC.⁶⁷\nLast but not least, the ‘constant care’ obligation should not be accepted as limited to this article. It involves all phases of operations and attacks, which are carried out by both attacking and defending parties. For this reason, it has a guidance function while examining all provisions of Articles 57 and 58.\n## 2.3 Feasibility\nArticle 57 obliges parties to take ‘feasible’ precautions in order to minimize the effects of an attack on civilians and civilian objects. In the Official Commentary of Article 57, it is stated that those precautions are ‘everything that was practicable or practically possible, taking into account all the circumstances at the time of the attack, including\n⁶⁰.

At this point, every situation has its unique features, and those responsible for an attack should adapt various precautions by considering the characteristics of the situation. For example, an attacker party should map the target network through exploitation operations if it is connected to other civilian networks.71 In such situations, LOAC not only permits cyber espionage but also obligates a belligerent party to conduct these operations. However, such operations require a certain level of technical expertise, and in the absence of that, such a network should not be exploited.72 Despite such expertise, some mistakes may occur in the 'fog of war'.73 At this point, a commander who took 'all due measures' is not responsible for this harm.74 Those measures can be identified by different factors such as available cyber means, time sensitivity, the cyber defence system of the enemy, the characteristics of the target, intelligence assets, the expertise of the attacking team, the loyalty of the enemy of to the LOAC, and available assets and vulnerabilities of the enemy.75 However, even if feasible precautions are taken, unintended results may occur for various reasons, such as failure of the intelligence system, dysfunction of the technology, or unexpected changes in tactical conditions.76 For instance, a commander might prepare a map of a cyber network before conducting an attack, but the virus unintentionally spreads among the civilian infrastructure, which has a connection with the military network.77 At this point, while deciding on whether the principle of precautions is respected or not, one should not focus on outcomes, but compliance should be measured by the process in which an\n68.

Therefore, it is permitted for the military commander in the Naval Manual of Ecuador to use alternative methods ‘in light of all the facts known or reasonably available to him, including the need to conserve resources and complete the mission successfully’.⁸¹ However, if it is understood that using less advanced weapons will result in excessive collateral damage, then they should either use advanced ones or cancel the attack.⁸²\nOn the other hand, the determination of feasibility on a contextual basis should not be used to assuage the burden from the shoulders of the attacker. For example, the use of white phosphorus shells near al-Wafa hospital, where patients have serious injuries and need long-term care, by the Israeli armed forces was deemed a violation of Articles 57(2)(b) and (c) of the AP-I.⁸³ It was stated that those who were responsible for the attack should be aware of ‘all the facts and circumstances’.⁸⁴ For this reason, while conducting a cyber operation against a system in which some medical records may be located, the attacking party should take special care. The same is valid for facilities such as dams, where dangerous forces are located.⁸⁵\n## 2.4 Responsibility\nThe wording of Article 57 restricts its applicability to ‘those who plan or decide upon an attack’. Because of this wording, some states have expressed reservations about Article 57, claiming that it only applies to ‘commanding officers at the battalion or group level and those of higher ranks’.⁸⁶ Nonetheless, every soldier who breaches obligations imposed by the LOAC bears individual criminal responsibility for his/her acts when such crimes are committed with ‘intent and knowledge’.⁸⁷ At this point, it does\n⁷⁸.

The reason is that volumetric attacks can end up using all available channel capacity, which would affect the networks on the path to the target. This has happened in the past, with powerful DDoS attacks launched against specific targets and affecting entire internet infrastructure providers.⁹⁵\nHowever, the unpredictability of effects does not relieve the responsibility of all levels of command while conducting operations. According to Watkin, operational factors cannot be put forward in order not to take feasible precautions in today’s trend, which pursues to compromise ‘human rights-like accountability frameworks with operational decision making during armed conflict’.⁹⁶ Accordingly, all members of the armed forces who are part of operations in cyberspace should do everything feasible within their limits.\nWhile assessing the individual responsibility of officers, they should be judged by how much they know about a certain subject.

For this reason, later evidence which showed that ‘the danger did not actually exist’$^{98}$ cannot be used to convict the commander since he ‘acted within the limits of honest judgment on the basis of the conditions prevailing at the time’.$^{99}$ This is crucial considering the interconnectivity of cyberspace since cyber attacks might affect civilian networks unexpectedly despite a commander’s employment of the advanced technology to conduct constant surveillance over a network.$^{100}$ At this point, the responsibility arising out of a cyber attack would not go beyond what the defendant knew at the time of the attack.\nOn the other hand, one needs to distinguish misinformation from misconception. Misconception of the nature of the target might occur because of cognitive bias, which misdirects attackers by analyzing information ‘in a manner that supports their pre-existing beliefs or mental frameworks’.$^{101}$ States should employ a variety of techniques such as ‘training and education, red teaming procedures, specific positive identification (PID) policies for targeting, use of structured analytic techniques, and other analytic tradecraft practices’ in order for this not to result in civilian damage.$^{102}$ Despite the fact that states are keen to protect soldiers in such situations,$^{103}$ inflicting civilian harm due to biased decisions does not very well fit with the notion of ‘honest judgement’.\nLastly, those who undertake cyber operations may be fully aware of the results of their actions owing to their technical expertise since cyberspace requires unique understanding compared to traditional domains. If a higher commander issues an order to launch a cyber operation without being aware of the outcomes in good faith, inferior commanders will be responsible for such intentional conduct. However, if a commander is aware that he lacks sufficient information about a target, he should either change the concept of the attack or refrain from issuing such an order.$^{104}$ Should an operation continue to be carried out while being aware of this insufficiency, responsibility arises.\n# 3 PRECAUTIONS IN ATTACK\n## 3.1 Target verification\nIt is stated in Article 57(2) of the AP-I that:\n(a) those who plan or decide upon an attack shall:\n(i) do everything feasible to verify that the objectives to be attacked are neither civilians nor civilian objects and are not subject to special protection but are military objectives within the\n97.

For this reason, an object that is military in nature should not be subject to attack if it does not effectively contribute to the military capacity of an enemy.^[107]^\nWhile only Article 52(2) of the AP-I has found its place in the provision, lawful targets also include people who can be made the object of direct cyber attacks. According to the LOAC, various categories of people can be held as lawful targets. The first one consists of combatants who are members of the armed forces and have a right to directly participate in hostilities.^[108]^ Even though they are lawful targets, they have a right to be treated as prisoners of war when they are captured by the enemy.^[109]^\nThe second category includes direct participants in hostilities. Although they are civilian in nature, they will be accepted as lawful targets if they meet three cumulative criteria which are: threshold of harm, direct causation and belligerent nexus.^[110]^ Those people are lawful targets 'for such time as they take a direct part in hostilities',^[111]^ and if they are captured, they cannot benefit from prisoner of war status.\nThe third category, though there is a discussion on it, consists of members of an organized armed group that is a belligerent party in an armed conflict. They are 'individuals whose continuous function involves the preparation, execution, or command of acts or operations amounting to direct participation in hostilities'.^[112]^\n105.

In the same vein, various authors claimed that conducting military operations without having a doubt on the nature of a target is not a reasonable expectation in the fog of war.¹¹⁸ From this perspective, there is always some doubt as an inherent characteristic of combat. On the other hand, the present author thinks that the Official Commentary should be interpreted as the aim of a commander. By stating the ‘slight doubt’ requirement, the commentary obligates them to take better precautions even if it is possible to erase this doubt. This is approved by military practice, in which attacks are cancelled when combatants are not ‘certain’¹¹⁹ or ‘100 percent sure of their aiming point’.¹²⁰ According to Parks, the US achieved this level of accuracy during the Linebacker II campaign by constantly confirming the nature of targets, implementing rules set by the Strategic Air Command, and issuing bomb damage assessments after each attack.¹²¹ Despite the fact that such high-level precautions sometimes pose substantial risks to the combatants’ lives, he acknowledges that they are important not only in terms of legality but also for achieving military and political objectives.¹²² By considering such positive outcomes, a commander should be sure enough that he/she made reasonable efforts to verify the nature of the target in cyberspace.¹²³\n113.

At this point, cyber attack should be limited to that component, which is military in nature.¹²⁴ If it is not possible, then the attack should be cancelled. However, this should not be equated with being ‘perfectly familiar with the network’¹²⁵ since such an interpretation is not appropriate with the term ‘feasible’.\n## 3.2 Choice of cyber means and methods\nAfter the nature of the target is verified, the next step will be to compose an operational plan that will have a minimum effect on civilians. At this point, it is stated in Article 57 (2)(a)(ii) of the AP-I that members of the armed forces should ‘take all feasible precautions in the choice of means and methods of attack with a view to avoiding, and in any event to minimising, incidental loss or civilian life, injury to civilians and damage to civilian objects’. This means that even if an attack is proportionate, parties to the conflict should be careful in their choice of means and methods in order to minimize the effects of attacks as much as possible while still aiming to obtain maximum military advantage. At this point, an attacking party should produce a plan that promises to give the most efficient operational and legal results.¹²⁶\nIt is important to define ‘cyber means’ and ‘methods’. Cyber means are defined as ‘cyber weapons and their associated cyber systems’¹²⁷ in the Tallinn Manual. At this point, cyber weapons are kinds of cyber means, but the latter includes a broader category. Cyber methods, on the other hand, are defined as ‘the cyber tactics, techniques, and procedures by which hostilities are conducted’.¹²⁸ Whilst cyber means are concerned with which tools should be employed to carry out cyber operations, cyber methods are concerned with how these operations should be carried out.¹²⁹ Based on this viewpoint, while botnets are a type of cyber means, the DDoS attack that is conducted by botnets can be considered a type of cyber method.¹³⁰\nThere is no weapon or method that is specifically prohibited in the provision. It only obliges parties to take feasible precautions by choosing appropriate means and methods; thereby, a commander will not be responsible for causing civilian harm. However, the rule does not require parties to choose means and methods that may decrease their expected military advantage.¹³¹ Even if alternative means and methods are not used because of this concern, a planned cyber attack must abide by other principles such as distinction and proportionality.¹³² On the other hand, if choosing different means and methods may change the degree of damage by producing ‘equivalent effects’ upon the target, then alternative means or methods shall be selected.¹³³ A facility where armed forces of a belligerent party conduct cyber attacks against the enemy,\n¹²⁴.

However, this may result in civilian deaths who live in the vicinity of the facility. At this point, if an attacking party has available means to conduct a cyber attack, it shall use them against the system or computers in the facility to stop belligerent attacks. Additionally, military personnel’s expertise with those new technologies is crucial. The concern was raised in the Eritrea-Ethiopia Claims Commission. Even though Eritrea refused Ethiopia’s allegations that some of its aircraft intentionally attacked civilians, the inexperience of Eritrean pilots in using ‘computerized aiming systems’, which led to the failure to target military objectives, was held as a violation of Article 57 of the AP-I.¹³⁴ Lastly, a ‘target list’ can be prepared and constantly reviewed by belligerent parties in order to determine which type of weapon should be used to decrease civilian harm by considering the characteristics of the target.¹³⁵ For example, the bombardment of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) compound by the Israeli Armed Forces, which resulted in extensive damage and endangered the lives of many civilians, was accepted as reckless conduct and a violation of Article 57(2)(a)(ii) of the AP-I since it was executed while being aware of its importance for civilians.¹³⁶ However, in the Vietnam War, the US employed fragmentation bombs that had limited effects on the target to execute attacks against anti-aircraft batteries; since these batteries were located inside dikes, the army tried to refrain from damaging them.¹³⁷\nThe accuracy and range of weapons also have a particular importance in the execution of attacks.¹³⁸ If a target can be destroyed by accurate weapons, then it does not make sense to use dumb bombs or other means whose effects may not be calculated properly or limited. In this sense, the US practice in the Linebacker II campaign is important. During the campaign, the B-52s that have wide-range effects were employed because of weather conditions and the limited number of the more precise weapons.¹³⁹ But to keep the collateral damage to a minimum, the B-52s were used against targets that were either sufficiently large or in military-industrial complexes.¹⁴⁰ Other objectives requiring pinpoint strikes, such as bridges and railroad yards, were hit by more precise weapons when weather conditions permitted, which was limited to 12 hours during the 12-day campaign.¹⁴¹\nAs such practice in a highly interconnected battle arena demonstrates, cyber means and weapons should be used against adversaries while always considering their accuracy and range. When it would not be possible to precisely damage a cyber target that is interconnected with a civilian network, they should be used against military cyber networks, or at least those networks whose destruction does not have a significant impact on civilians. In this manner, a cyber mean can be designed to affect only a specific type of system, as it was in the Stuxnet incident, in which malware only affected the SCADA systems.\n¹³⁴.

That attack used ‘wormable’ destructive malware that could jump from one computer domain to another and hence cross borders into other countries. Russia has been careful in 2022 to confine destructive ‘wiper software’ to specific network domains inside Ukraine itself. But the recent and ongoing destructive attacks themselves have been sophisticated and more widespread than many reports recognize. And the Russian army is continuing to adapt these destructive attacks to changing war needs, including by coupling cyberattacks with the use of conventional weapons.¹⁴⁵\nThis passage raises two concerns. First, which types of cyber means are used? Second, excluding other considerations such as political or military ones, why did the Russians allegedly employ such means in an armed conflict while adhering to the LOAC?\nAs an answer to the first question, the Microsoft Report lists cyber means that were used or are in use in the Russia-Ukraine War:\n1. WhisperGate/WhisperKill\n2. FoxBlade, aka HermeticWiper\n3. DesertBlade\n4. CaddyWiper\n5. Lasainraw, aka IsaacWiper\n6. FiberLake, aka DoubleZero\n7. SonicVote, aka HermeticRansom\n8. Industroyer2\nAccording to the report, numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4 are ‘all malware families that overwrite data and render machines unbootable’; number 6 is a ‘.NET capability being used for data deletion’; number 7 is a ‘file encryptor sometimes used together with FoxBlade’; and number 8 ‘specifically targets operational technology to achieve physical effects in industrial production and processes’.¹⁴⁶ Even though the Microsoft Report does not give detail about number 5, another report states that it deletes data from physical and logical drives, though its impact is limited.¹⁴⁷ Except for number 8, the effects\n¹⁴².

This brings an important issue to the surface. Even though the debate exists, operations causing such damage do not constitute attacks in terms of *lex lata*. Therefore, it would not be possible to apply Article 57 (2)(a)(ii) to those malwares since the rule encompasses means of warfare that are ‘used, designed, or intended to be used to conduct a cyber attack’.¹⁴⁸ Then the question would be why Russia needs to employ such discriminatory cyber means.\nFrom the present author’s perspective, the war demonstrated that the key benefit of using cyber means in warfare is their adaptability, instead of previous assumptions that cyber operations provide a belligerent party an advantage owing to their low cost or non-attributability. As stated in the report, Russia adapted such means to ‘changing war needs’.¹⁴⁹ This adaptation should be seen from two perspectives: cyber and kinetic. The former is important from a technical standpoint, and the latter is important from a legal standpoint, but both of them need to be examined because of their importance from a military standpoint.\nEven though it does not have a direct relationship with the legality of cyber means in terms of Article 57(2)(a)(ii), the technical standing point is important to understand why parties adopt cyber means in armed conflicts. Every new step in technology has the potential to threaten the kinetic weapon supremacy of an adversary. For example, the invention of a new type of surface-to-air missile system can erase the advantage of the adversary’s aircraft, and the attacking party needs to make a huge investment to improve its aircraft and produce new ones to establish a new squadron. On the other hand, the adaptability of cyber means makes it possible for past used malware to escape from such quick elimination. By adding some extra codes, a cyber weapon can be adjusted based on a new type of cyber security measure, and such modification can turn it into a new type of weapon. As stated by the ICRC, ‘it is possible for offensive cyber capabilities to be reverse-engineered or repurposed so that they can be reused. This is also the case for some traditional weapon systems, but the technical characteristics of cyberspace raise these concerns in a unique manner’.¹⁵⁰ This uniqueness has been and continues to be demonstrated in the Russia-Ukraine War. Numerous reports claim that Russia used or is using malware by modifying previously used ones. In other words, cyber security updates also bring updates to those malwares, and they are adapted to changing needs in the cyber environment. For example, AcidRain, a wiper malware used to disrupt the VIASAT satellite, shares some characteristics with VPNFilter, a kind of malware used by Russia-backed cyber-organized groups in 2018.¹⁵¹ Also, such modifications do not have to take a long time. Shortly after the intrusion of WhisperGate into Ukrainian systems and its detection by cyber security companies, Russia altered it and developed a new type of malware, Hermeticwiper, that ‘has some similarities to the earlier WhisperGate’.¹⁵² This shows that detecting malware and taking defensive measures against it do not make such malware useless, but certain parts of the codes can still be used by belligerents to improve their cyber capabilities owing to their adaptability.\n¹⁴⁸.

Figure 1 above, depicted by Microsoft, shows how critical infrastructures are subject to cyber operations as the Russian tanks roll toward cities. Additionally, the fact that certain facilities, which are being physically attacked, were subject to cyber operations, demonstrates that the coordination is not general but rather as specific as possible. As a result, every operation that is part of an attack has to be evaluated within the meaning of the LOAC, and this necessitates evaluating the cyber means stated above to be employed by respecting relevant rules, including the principle of precautions.\nWhile choosing cyber methods, the first relevant factor is the timing of the attack to minimize collateral damage.[154] During World War II, Allied Forces conducted attacks on military factories at times when there were a minimum number of civilian workers present.[155] In that vein, for example, while carrying out cyber attacks against dual-use objects, the belligerent party may execute them at night or early in the morning when the targets are not intensively used by civilians.\n153.

If a target is located in a place that is mostly used by civilians and there is a significant level of risk of harm occurring, the attacker shall use the most accurate weapons available or must refrain from conducting such an attack.¹⁵⁶ At this point, there is a discussion on whether the Internet can be held as a lawful target because, while it might make an effective contribution to the military capacity of the enemy, it is mostly used by civilians. Even though it is argued that if an attacking party believes that it can get enough military advantage, a cyber attack against the Internet is permissible,¹⁵⁷ another opinion accepts the Internet as a civilian object and prohibits such an attack.¹⁵⁸ According to the latter opinion, even if it is intended to carry out a cyber attack against the Internet, it should be limited to ‘individual networks, servers, routers, links, and other computer facilities that are used for military purposes and which are likely to be connected to the Internet’.¹⁵⁹ By accepting the latter interpretation, the present author considers that if it is possible to considerably limit the effects of the attack, especially by considering the dual nature of cyberspace, then an attack may be conducted. If not, it will be in breach of the rule.\nWhilst some authors argue that the choice of means and methods only come onto the scene when there is a similar advantage,¹⁶⁰ the present author thinks that the criteria should not be applied strictly. As stated by Borghard and Lonergan while discussing coercion in cyberspace, the attacking party tries to apply less harmful ways, such as disruptive operations rather than destructive ones, in order to better negotiate at later stages since the system may be restored more easily when the former type of means are used.¹⁶¹ At this point, the belligerent party should choose the type of means or methods to achieve the intended outcomes by considering the post-conflict situation.¹⁶² There is no doubt that a large number of civilian deaths will prolong the conflict, even if the attacks are perfectly legal. The bombing of Radio-Television of Serbia by NATO, which sparked so many debates about the legality of the campaign, may be an example of the adverse impact of such conduct. To Kolb, even if the station can be assumed as a military objective, it was repaired in three hours, and 16 civilians were killed because of the attack.¹⁶³ By taking lessons from this example, it can be stated that belligerent parties should always consider alternatives, even if a designed cyber attack seems lawful. In such a case, disrupting broadcasting by cyber operation might produce better consequences, even though it seems that destruction promises more advantage. In these kinds of situations, perpetrators should always keep the humanitarian aims of the LOAC in mind.\n¹⁵⁶.

However, both of these provisions have similar meanings by prohibiting attacks conducted against a legitimate target if it seems that ‘excessive’ collateral damage will occur, whether the cyber attack is being planned or has already been planned.¹⁶⁴ At this point, there should be a balance between military advantage and civilian harm.\n## 3.3.1 Military advantage\nThe advantage should be military in nature rather than merely moral, political or financial.¹⁶⁵ For example, conducting cyber attacks against specific sectors of a country, such as the oil industry, which is vital for Arab countries, by considering that such an operation against ‘war-sustaining objects’ will decrease the military effort of an enemy is not appropriate since ‘almost every civilian activity might be construed by the enemy as indirectly sustaining the war effort’ as stated by Dinstein.¹⁶⁶ Also, it is stated in the Official Commentary that this type of advantage can only be gained by the annihilation of an enemy or gaining ground; the transformation of the notion of war, however, changed this paradigm.¹⁶⁷ While the former can be categorized as an overstatement, the latter seems to be an understatement. Hence, as a moderate approach, the HPCR Manual Commentary points out that ‘any consequence of an attack which directly enhances friendly military operations or hinders those of the enemy’¹⁶⁸ should be included within the ambit of military advantage.\nCyber attacks should be assessed as a whole while aiming to obtain military advantage.¹⁶⁹ As stated by Fenrick and approved by declarations of numerous states, proportionality calculations cannot be made on either ‘a bullet-by-bullet basis’ or ‘the basis of attacks on individual military objectives’.¹⁷⁰ Furthermore, when the army launches concerted or coordinated cyber attacks, it may be impossible or impractical for every\n¹⁶⁴.

Although it was claimed that people who give an order will bear responsibility rather than those who execute the attack in such a case, if it is apparent that the targeted network is civilian in nature after the attack is initiated, it should be cancelled or a confirmation should be demanded by the perpetrator from higher ranks in light of changing circumstances.¹⁷² Lastly, assessing a cyber attack as a whole should not be interpreted as having a purpose to obtain military advantage by taking the ‘full context of a war strategy’ into account.¹⁷³ Otherwise, all cyber attacks, whether they incur excessive civilian damages or not, can be deemed legal in defiance of the aims of the LOAC.\n## 3.3.2 Collateral damage\nCollateral damage can be described as an ‘incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians and damage to civilian objects or other protected objects or a combination thereof, caused by an attack on a lawful target’.¹⁷⁴ At this point, collateral damage occurs while conducting cyber attacks against military targets without deliberately targeting civilians and civilian property.\nCollateral damage includes both the direct and indirect effects of a cyber attack. While the former type of effects are those that ‘are the immediate, first order consequence of a military action (weapons employment results, etc.), unaltered by intervening events or mechanisms’;¹⁷⁵ the latter type of effects are ‘the delayed or displaced second-, third-, and higher-order consequences of action, created through intermediate events or mechanisms’.¹⁷⁶ Since cyber operations are carried out at the logical layer of cyberspace, their first-order effects have an impact on data, programs, or software; nevertheless, such effects are not included in the aforementioned definition of collateral damage.¹⁷⁷ Yet, ‘indirect effects may be aimed at the other layers of cyberspace, or at creating other higher-order effects in other domains’, and thereby such effects can raise the level of collateral damage.¹⁷⁸ Therefore, the inclusion of indirect effects in the concept of collateral harm is crucial. However, due to the complexity involved in calculating second- or higher-order effects, such an inclusion also poses a significant challenge in cyberspace. As acknowledged in the Allied Doctrine:\nSince cyberspace is a global domain, there is a risk of COs [cyberspace operations] having an impact outside the joint operations area. COs can create undesired effects on our own\n¹⁷¹. Quéguiner (fn 154) 804.\n¹⁷². Ibid at 804–805.\n¹⁷³.

This risk, as with similar risks in other domains, is factored into the planning.¹⁷⁹\nEven though it is not necessary to make certain calculations, effects which are too remote or beyond the scope of reasonable certainty will not cause any responsibility for combatants.¹⁸⁰ Lastly, collateral damage does not contain minor effects such as stress, irritation or inconvenience.¹⁸¹ All cyber attacks might cause stress or inconvenience to some extent, but that does not make them illegal.\n## 3.3.3 Excessive collateral damage\nBelligerent parties should always consider whether the expected military advantage is proportionate compared to the anticipated collateral damage. At this point, the terms ‘extensive’ and ‘excessive’ should be differentiated. In the Official Commentary, it was argued that conducting attacks against lawful targets should not create ‘extensive destruction of civilian objects’¹⁸² despite the fact that there is no reference to such a limitation in the Additional Protocols. The collateral damage can be justified even if it is at the ‘extensive’ level on the condition that the nominated target is important enough. Although civilian casualties are ‘regrettable and tragic consequences of the war’, those losses do not ‘in themselves establish liability … under international law’ as stated by the Eritrea-Ethiopia Claims Commission.¹⁸³\nExcessiveness cannot be determined by approaching it as a mathematical formula, despite the fact that ‘[f]ifty civilians killed for one suspected combatant’ is given as a ‘textbook example of a violation of the proportionality principle’ by some authors.¹⁸⁴ However, as stated in the NATO Bombing Report:\nIt is much easier to formulate the principle of proportionality in general terms than it is to apply it to a particular set of circumstances because the comparison is often between unlike quantities and values. One cannot easily assess the value of innocent human lives as opposed to capturing a particular military objective.¹⁸⁵\nHence, excessiveness should be evaluated depending upon the comparison between two values, namely, collateral damage and military advantage. Although it is hard to estimate excessiveness in cyberspace and to prevent it, there are methods to make a reasonable assessment. It is stated in the Allied Doctrine that:\nCOs [cyberspace operations] will be conducted according to the operation plan. As such, SCEPVA [Sovereign Cyber Effects Provided Voluntarily by Allies], when authorised, might give the commander alternative options to create effects. These options are integrated,\n¹⁷⁹.

At this point, the determination of the effects and excessiveness of an action will be based on the good faith of the combatant, its reasonableness and the circumstances in which the cyber attack is planned and executed.\n## 3.4 Effective warning\nIt is stated in Article 57(2)(c) of the AP-I that ‘effective advance warning shall be given of attacks which may affect the civilian population, unless circumstances do not permit’. The first appearance of this rule can be traced back to the Lieber Code, in which it was stated that:\nCommanders, whenever admissible, inform the enemy of their intention to bombard a place, so that the noncombatants, and especially the women and children, may be removed before the bombardment commences. But it is no infraction of the common law of war to omit thus to inform the enemy. Surprise may be a necessity.¹⁸⁷\nAs it can be observed from the article, if a party plans to conduct a surprise cyber attack, it does not need to give any warning so as not to endanger the success of the operation.¹⁸⁸ Surprise may be necessary in some cases, such as when there is a risk of a pre-emptive cyber attack or the exposure of a broader campaign.¹⁸⁹ The Tallinn Manual illustrates this by saying that:\nConsider, for example, a cyber operation involving placement of a kill-switch into the target computer’s control system, to be activated on the occurrence of some future event or after the passage of a specified period. A warning that would give the enemy an opportunity to locate and neutralise the device need not be given.¹⁹⁰\nTherefore, giving warning is limited to appropriate circumstances since an attacker may have special reasons that justify not giving any warning.¹⁹¹ A relevant consideration could be the equation comparing the level of military advantage between situations in which giving occurs and those in which it does not. If the gap justifies civilian harm, then the attacking party does not need to give a warning in advance.\nIf it is expected that the cyber attack will exclusively affect civilian objects and not have any impact on civilians, then giving warning will not be necessary.¹⁹² By approving this point, the Australian Military Manual states that the warning can be directed at civilians, who bear the dangers posed by an intended attack, or at responsible authorities.¹⁹³ In that vein, if harm to civilians is expected, then they can be warned in many ways through\n¹⁸⁶.

Even though the Australian Military Manual suggests adopting ‘commonsense’ to achieve effectiveness, this does not clarify the notion but adds extra blurriness to it.¹⁹⁷ On the other hand, the term ‘effective’ is defined in the dictionary as ‘producing a decided, decisive, or desired effect’.¹⁹⁸ Based on this definition, it can at least be said that in order for a warning to be effective, it should aim to reduce collateral damage to a minimum. To accomplish this, the content of the warning should be reasonably clear and specific so that civilians have a chance to secure themselves from the effects of an attack.¹⁹⁹ Both of these terms should be determined based on the context. In terms of clarity, rather than giving technical details, belligerent parties may underline the effects of cyber attacks and provide guidelines to civilians on how to protect themselves from such effects. In terms of specificity, there is no requirement to give a specific warning for every situation; the warning may be general in a way that provides a list of cyber objectives that might be targeted.²⁰⁰ Overall, there is no one correct method to issuing effective warnings, but they should be tailored to diverse scenarios to protect civilians.\nWarnings can be conducted through an enemy if it makes the warning more effective.²⁰¹ However, such a warning can also be used as a ruse of war. For example, ‘a false announcement of a cyber attack affecting dual-use systems might prove militarily useful in causing the enemy to take its military assets off-line’.²⁰² Nevertheless, if it is expected that such a warning causes civilians to ignore future real warnings and to put them in danger, then this will be prohibited.²⁰³ Further, the belligerent party should not give a warning in order to spread terror among civilians.²⁰⁴ As stated in Article 51(2) of the AP-I, ‘[a]cts or threats of violence the primary purpose of which is to spread terror among the civilian population are prohibited’. For this reason, warnings given through cyberspace that aim to ‘frighten or cause panic among residents or compel them to leave their homes for reasons other than their safety’ are forbidden.²⁰⁵ Although there is always a danger for civilians to be exposed to fake news via the Internet without the knowledge of the attacking party, it is also their obligation to search for the truth.\n194.

Therefore, this rule is also known as ‘the lesser of two evils’.²⁰⁶ The rationale behind the article is simple: While a commander is trying to get the maximum effect on the military capacity of the enemy, he/she should seek an option which has minimum effect on civilians. The example given in the Official Commentary is that ‘[i]nstead of attacking railway stations, which are usually located in towns, the railway lines were hit at crucial points, but away from inhabited areas; the same action was taken with respect to roads’.²⁰⁷ By analogy, it can be stated that cyber attacks should be conducted against specific networks of electricity distribution facilities rather than the whole power station.²⁰⁸ However, the rule comes into scene when two different options promise military advantage at the same level.²⁰⁹ Otherwise, the attack is subject to other provisions and principles, i.e., proportionality.\nThere are two critical discussions to have while inflicting the least amount of harm on civilians and civilian property. First, whether or not causing harm to civilians and civilian property is equally important. At this point, while discussing the Kosovo Conflict, General Clark states that ‘[w]e weren’t going to disregard risks to civilians but the alternative to taking risks with property damage was that we might ultimately have to put our troops in on the ground’.²¹⁰ From this example, it seems that objects have less value than civilian lives in practice. However, cyber operations are more likely to have effects on objects than on people. Therefore, the relevant discussion may be whether all objects have the same value in cyberspace. At this point, Henderson offers to determine the value of objects by various factors such as ‘the “utility” of the object, the objects “replace-ability”, and the cost of replacement’.²¹¹ In that vein, in terms of utility, it may be preferable to have an impact on financial records rather than medical data in cyberspace. The second discussion is whether belligerent parties put civilians at greater risk than their own troops. Although some states and scholars adopt the opinion that the security of armed forces should be included in military advantage,²¹² another approach holds that the armed forces must accept the risks posed by combat actions, and those risks should not be borne by civilians.²¹³ The present author considers that an attacking party who conducts cyber attacks against an enemy already minimizes the dangers of combat for its own troops because of their remoteness\n²⁰⁶.

Therefore, it should not disregard civilian damage by claiming force protection.\nBeyond mere humanitarianism, it is a military reality to target legitimate objectives to the maximum extent while harming civilians to the minimum. Carnahan states that '[t]he wise military officer will try to concentrate firepower on key military objectives and to keep to a minimum the collateral damage not only for humanitarian reasons, but also because munitions that injure civilians are wasted munitions'.[214] When the humanitarian impacts of such 'wasted munitions' are considered along with their military value, it is a well-known fact that when civilian harm increases, the likelihood of success of the mission decreases, so belligerent parties should aim to put the least amount of risk on civilians if there is an opportunity to refrain from it while gaining a military advantage at the same level, or at least another option that significantly decreases the military advantage.[215]\n# 4 PRECAUTIONS AGAINST THE EFFECTS OF CYBER OPERATIONS\n## 4.1 General remarks\nIt is stated in Article 58 of the AP-I that:\nThe Parties to the conflict shall, to the maximum extent feasible:\n(a) without prejudice to Article 49 of the Fourth Convention, endeavour to remove the civilian population, individual civilians and civilian objects under their control from the vicinity of military objectives;\n(b) avoid locating military objectives within or near densely populated areas;\n(c) take the other necessary precautions to protect the civilian population, individual civilians and civilian objects under their control against the dangers resulting from military operations.\nThe rationale behind the article is to abstain from 'defensive tactics that unnecessarily increases civilian risk' by endangering civilians and civilian objects to the detrimental effects of military operations.[216] For this reason, belligerent parties should segregate their military objectives from civilians and civilian objectives; if this is not possible, they should at least protect these people and objects from the effects of cyber operations.[217]\nThe rule is applicable within the territory of the belligerent party, which is responsible for the protection of its nationals or people under its control.[218] However, this territorial application of the rule may pose a significant hurdle in cyberspace. Although it was claimed that 'all civilian cyber infrastructure and activities located in territory under the control of a party to the conflict are subject to this Rule', this approach cannot be applicable in cyberspace since it is almost impossible to control every civilian activity in this domain.[219] This follows a risk that a responsible government may claim\n214.

Although the term ‘feasible’ was explained in the first chapter, the Official Commentary further clarifies this term by noting that those measures should ‘not go beyond the point where the life of the population would become difficult or even impossible’.²²² Also, the Tallinn Manual explains the term ‘maximum extent’ in a way that it ‘emphasises the importance of taking the requisite measures’.²²³ According to one approach, those measures can be applied depending upon ‘the requirements of national defence’ as stated in the declaration of Austria.²²⁴ From this perspective, parties do not need to expose all of their military facilities, or to put them in a more dangerous position by considering the dictations of the national defence.²²⁵ This is explained in Official Records by the delegation of the Republic of Korea with the following words:\n[T]his provision does not constitute a restriction on a State’s military installations on its own territory. We consider that military facilities necessary for a country’s national defence should be decided on the basis of the actual needs and other considerations of that particular country. An attempt to regulate a country’s requirements and the fulfilment of those requirements in this connexion would not conform to actualities.²²⁶\nThis is a valid argument since, as described in the first chapter, the principle of precautions obligates parties to take measures when they are ‘practicable or practically possible’. For this reason, every country has to take precautions against the effects of cyber attacks within its own limits.\nWhile the term ‘constant care’ is not explicitly stated in the article, it is still a valid consideration which should be taken into account in order to alleviate risks to civilians and civilian property.²²⁷ At this point, Corn points three reasons why constant care should be taken in both active and passive precautions:²²⁸ First, there is no clear line between ‘attacking’ and ‘defending’ parties in terms of operational art since every armed force needs to conduct both types of operations in the conflict. Second, ‘constant care’ obliges all parties of an armed conflict to conduct their operations by taking civilian harm into account as well as seeking to gain military advantage. This obligation cannot be confined to the attacking party. Third, the exclusion of defending\n220. Jensen (fn 58) 214–15.\n221. Ibid.\n222.

When the nature of cyberspace is taken into account, the obligation becomes more important than conventional warfare since the domain has many more complexities than other areas.\nThese measures are similarly sampled in the ICRC Challenge Report and the Tallinn Manual while discussing feasible precautions against the effects of cyber attacks:\n[S]egregating military from civilian cyber infrastructure; segregating computer systems on which critical civilian infrastructure depends from the Internet; backing up important civilian data; making advance arrangements to ensure the timely repair of important computer systems; digitally recording important cultural or spiritual objects to facilitate reconstruction in the event of their destruction; and using anti-virus measures to protect civilian systems that might suffer damage or destruction during an attack on military cyber infrastructure.²²⁹\nThis is not an exhaustive list, and every situation may require different precautions to be taken.\n## 4.2 The segregation of civilian networks\nAs it is indicated above, Article 58(a) of the AP-I requires parties to ‘endeavour to remove the civilian population, individual civilians and civilian objects under their control from the vicinity of military objectives’. The obligation should be applied when there is an immediate danger to civilians, and they should be evacuated them from the territory ‘where the risk of attack is greatest’.²³⁰ Even if this measure brings some difficulty to civilians, it aims to protect them from greater suffering, and alternative accommodations should be provided.²³¹ If these measures are not achieved, this can be deemed forced displacement and a violation of international law.\nWhilst the rule seems applicable when traditional battlefield is taken into account, it still creates some problems. For example, the rule was opposed by Switzerland because of its geographical conditions, where most civilians live in valleys in which important military facilities are located due to the limited number of useful locations in the country, so it becomes very hard to segregate civilians and civilian objects from the proximity of these facilities.²³² The same hardship is applicable for some facilities that can be important for both civilians and military personnel, such as air traffic control centres and power generation plants.²³³\nOn the other hand, the application of the rule in cyberspace brings more difficulty than in traditional domains. Civilian infrastructures are used for almost all cyber operations, and most of them have a dual nature.²³⁴ As an example, how can civilians be removed from cloud technology, which is also used for military purposes?²³⁵ Nevertheless, it is argued in a legal assessment published by the US Department of Defence that ‘[w]here there is a choice … military systems should be kept separate from\n²²⁹.

The United States military uses multiple, dedicated networks to conduct administrative, logistical and operational activities. The three best-known networks are the Non-Classified Internet Protocol Router Network (NIPRnet, which carries information classified up to and including Sensitive but Unclassified), Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRnet, which carries data classified up to and including the Secret level) and the Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communication System (JWICS carries data classified up to and including Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information).²³⁹\nAs this example clearly shows, it is imperative to segregate the different types of networks, even if it can be costly.²⁴⁰ Otherwise, if the object makes an effective contribution and the segregation cannot be established, then the whole cyber infrastructure would be a lawful target.²⁴¹\nGovernmental and civilian data can be stored in the public cloud, despite the fact that this does not literally satisfy the criteria for segregation. However, the Russia-Ukraine War proved its usefulness in terms of reducing cyber dangers. The Ukrainian government moved an important part of the state’s digital infrastructure to the public cloud in preparation for Russian cyber operations against its governmental data center.²⁴² In this sense, cloud technology turns the disadvantage of cyber infrastructure’s interconnectedness into an advantage. As a more advanced example, the Estonian government established a ‘data embassy’ whose ‘resources are under Estonian state control, secured against cyberattacks or crisis situations with KSI [Keyless Signature Infrastructure] Blockchain technology, and are capable not only providing data backups, but also operating the most critical services’.²⁴³ The particular advantage of such precautions compared with network segregation is that they protect civilian data not only from cyber attacks but also from other types of crises that might occur within states’ borders, such as natural disasters or kinetic attacks.²⁴⁴\nIf such precautions impose a significant burden on the belligerent and are not feasible solutions, belligerent parties should search for other ways to shield civilian\n236.

From this perspective, parties to the conflict should refrain from locating both movable and immovable objects close to densely populated areas in order to protect civilians under their control.²⁴⁷ Nevertheless, the rule should not be limited to densely populated areas but also include ‘hospitals, cultural property, places of worship, prisoner of war camps, and other facilities which are entitled to specific protection’²⁴⁸ by refraining from locating cyber military objectives in or around them.\nWhile the applicability of the rule is understood in a physical sense, and social media or other similar civilian websites ‘cannot be equated with densely populated areas’, the rule obliges parties to take measures by considering cyber infrastructures which are physically located in the territory of a party.²⁴⁹ Therefore, for instance, army cyber commands should not be located in places where civilians or special protected objects can be put in danger. However, there is a significant hurdle to locating defence ministries in a place which is not close to densely populated areas. On the other hand, it is still possible for parties to exclude these kinds of facilities, which are military in nature but almost impossible to locate in isolated places, from the ambit of the attack through negotiation. Even if they cannot be attacked, it is possible for a party to conduct disruptive cyber operations against cyber infrastructures in these facilities. At this point, cyber operations give a unique opportunity to parties not to harm civilians but to still have an impact on the military capacity of their enemies.\n## 4.4 Other passive measures\nAs it is stated above, belligerent parties should ‘take the other necessary precautions to protect the civilian population, individual civilians and civilian objects under their control against the dangers resulting from military operations’ according to Article 58(c) of the AP-I. While there is no limit on the scope of the rule, the Official Commentary states that this rule should be applied to civilians by providing them with protective shelters, as well as to specially protected objects by providing trained personnel to limit damage to them.²⁵⁰ However, conflicting parties should take all feasible precautions by taking the gap-filling function of Article 58(c) into account.\n²⁴⁵.

For example, civilians might be supported by providing them with software products such as anti-virus programs that limit the damage from cyber attacks, detecting civilian cyber systems in order to warn people in case of intrusion attempts, providing them technical assistance when their computer systems are harmed, providing a back-up system to store civilian data, blocking particular IP addresses which pose risks to civilian systems, and keeping ready a system that makes it possible to disconnect an entire country from the Internet when all measures are exhausted.²⁵²\nWhile the title of Article 58 includes ‘attacks’, paragraph (c) clearly states that some precautions should be applied to operations. Although Jensen admits the ambiguity of this situation, he argues that countries which are not parties to the AP-I have responsibility arising from this provision for those acts that reach ‘attack’ threshold.²⁵³ In the Tallinn Manual, even though the majority of experts stated that the rule is applicable only to cyber attacks because of the title of the article and the non-existence of customary law, the minority focused on the wording of paragraph (c) by accepting cyber operations within the ambit of this rule.²⁵⁴ Therefore, the minority view kept the threshold lower, determined disruptive operations to be covered by this rule, and obligated parties to take precautions against the effects of these operations.²⁵⁵ However, both parties have a common understanding on the non-application of the rule to ‘mere inconvenience or irritation’.²⁵⁶\nThere is no clear-cut answer on which precautions should be taken within the ambit of Article 58(c), since the provision serves as a gap-filler in the article. Despite the fact that it did not receive much attention in the past because the suitability of other provisions for kinetic activities made them more visible than paragraph (c), their relative unsuitability for cyber operations rendered this clause more important. At this point, the implementation of the norm in cyberspace has already begun to be shaped by the practices of both state and non-state actors, and this trend seems to be continuing and getting better. For example, the US government has begun to warn private entities when they are subjected to transborder cyber attacks and has provided them with cyber tools and training to combat those attacks.²⁵⁷ Furthermore, the Security Service of Ukraine informs civilians about cyber threats and what measures to take in order to avoid them.²⁵⁸ As a recent innovative example, the ICRC has been conducting research on creating a ‘digital emblem’ for the past two years in order to enable the identification of objects, systems, or networks that cannot be subject to cyber attacks.²⁵⁹ Lastly, even though these are individual precautionary measures, the Russia-Ukraine War has also demonstrated how state and non-state entities can collaborate to\n251.

The Microsoft Report highlights two examples of cyber security measures against Russian cyber activities:\nThe first has been the use of technology acquired from RiskIQ that identifies and maps organizational attack surfaces, including devices that are unpatched against known vulnerabilities and therefore are the most susceptible to attack. This information has been shared with the Ukrainian government free of charge to enable it to accelerate the strengthening of cyber-defenses. Ukrainian network defenders worked tirelessly with the constant support of the CERT UA within the government to use this information to protect computers across the country.\nThe second measure has been a wartime innovation pursued with the collaboration and support of the Ukrainian government. MSTIC recognized that Russian malware could be mitigated meaningfully by turning on a feature in Microsoft Defender called controlled folder access. This typically would require that IT administrators access devices across their organization, work made more difficult and potentially even dangerous in wartime conditions. The Ukrainian government therefore authorized Microsoft through special legal measures to act proactively and remotely to turn on this feature across devices throughout the government and across the country.²⁶⁰\nEvery effort having a purpose to minimize collateral damage is desired in cyberspace; the principle of precaution essentially relies on the processes but not the results.\n# 5 CONCLUSION\nNew technologies have changed the nature of armed conflict significantly, and this process increasingly continues. As one kind of these technologies, cyber operations have introduced significant challenges to the LOAC, but the most unique one is their capability to have a wide range of effects because of the interconnectedness of cyberspace. This article has endeavoured to determine the application of the principle of precautions to cyber operations by tilting the principle towards humanity by considering the natures of both the principle and cyberspace.\nFrom the standpoint of the principle of precautions, the Russia-Ukraine War exemplified an important phenomenon: public-private cooperation against adversarial cyber operations. Unlike traditional domains, private entities have a partial but critical level of control over cyberspace, and as a result of this distinctive feature of the current conflicts, the Ukrainian government collaborated with a technology giant, Microsoft.²⁶¹ This collaboration is emphasized in the Microsoft Report by stating that:\n[U]nlike the traditional threats of the past, cyber defenses rely on a unique level of public and private collaboration. The evolving threat landscape requires a whole-of-society approach. The private sector, particularly technology companies, are on the front lines of cyber and information attacks. Likewise, civil society organizations are key conveners that play a crucial role in engagement, sometimes are involved in cyber data analysis, and are often targets of these campaigns themselves.²⁶²\nBringing non-public entities into the equation in cyberspace, thereby putting more civilians in the balance, would enhance the ‘civilianization’ of armed conflicts, and this would inherently lean the principle of precaution on the side of humanity.\n²⁶⁰.

However, despite its practical importance, the principle of precautions seems to trail behind the other two concepts. This negligence extends not only to scholarly works but also to military doctrines. While the first two principles are often referred to as ‘principles’ in military manuals, the third does not have such a privilege. Nonetheless, it not only confirms or supplements these former principles but also prescribes some preliminary measures to avoid violating them.\nOn the other hand, the Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC) rules, which regulate the application of the principle of precautions, were designed to be applied during conventional warfare. Due to the interconnected nature of the cyber domain, however, it is difficult to apply these rules to cyber operations. Before discussing the complexity posed by the interconnectivity of cyberspace, it should be admitted that it is not unique to the cyber domain; traditional domains have this problem too. Almost half a century ago, the reality that there is ‘a geographical and functional mixture of combatants and civilians and military objectives and civilian objects’ in the conduct of military air\n1.

Despite the similarity between the traditional and cyber domains in terms of interconnectivity, what makes interconnectivity special regarding cyber military operations is that it ‘characterises cyberspace, which means that whatever has an interface with the Internet can be affected by cyber operations conducted from anywhere in the world’. In such a complex environment, the adoption of the principle of precautions while planning and executing cyber operations has utmost importance.\nThe interconnectivity problem should be approached from two perspectives, taking into account both the technical and the social factors. From the first standpoint, technical factors intensify the interconnectedness between military and civilian networks in cyberspace, therefore converting this domain into one of entirely dual-use nature and obstructing the distinction between military targets and civilian objects. As Jensen points out, ‘[w]ith 98% of day-to-day government communications routinely travelling over civilian communication lines, there will be many civilian lines of communication that will carry targetable electronic traffic intermixed with civilian traffic’. From this vantage point, not only is it highly difficult to make a certain distinction between civilian and military cyber infrastructures, but practically all military cyber activities must be carried out through dual-use cyber systems. In the absence of precautionary measures against such interconnectivity, the impacts of cyber activities might quickly spread to other systems across the globe and have the potential to significantly disrupt daily civilian life by having adverse impacts on civilian critical infrastructure and other associated systems. From this point of view, a cyber operation designed to disrupt a dual-used power plant located in a belligerent state could easily impair other systems, from water and food to ICT infrastructure, and its unintended effects might spill over into neutral countries.\nFrom the second point of view, interconnection becomes a more complicated matter when social factors are considered. Even though they are less obvious than technical ones, they still pose threats comparable to those of the latter, and it necessitates especially defensive parties to take unique precautionary measures. Therefore, it has been\n4. US Department of the Air Force, AF Pamphlet 110-31: International Law – The Conduct of Armed Conflict and Air Operations (1976) 5–10.\n5.

This perspective would reveal just how many components are connected and demonstrate the levels of complexity in a facility’. This entails that the human workforce of a facility needs to be considered in terms of the complexity of the system’s network. When this fact about a single facility is considered along with the global challenge of interconnectivity, the magnitude of the interconnectivity issue could be better understood.\nGiven that measures to prevent adversarial effects on cyber systems cannot keep up with their level of interconnectivity, this article aims to portray how to apply the principle of precautions to cyber operations and answers this question by taking its humanity-based character into account. The present author acknowledges that the articles articulating the principle of precautions are vague, as stated by state delegates during the negotiations of Additional Protocol-I or by state legal advisers. Such views on specific provisions of the article or the article as a whole are expressed using terms like ‘open to a variety of interpretations by the conflicting parties’ (for Article 57(2)(a)(ii)), ‘subjective’ ‘ambiguous’ (for Article 57(2)(a)), ‘deficient in clarity due to its generally vague wording’ (for Article 57), and ‘too general’ (for articles between 48 and 58). Moreover, delegates emphasized the hardships posed by applying these provisions in practice. When the complexity of cyberspace interconnectivity is combined with the ambiguity of the articles, applying the principle of precautions appears to bring together two ‘unknown unknowns’ in order to reach one ‘known known’. Throughout this piece of research, the author attempts to emphasize the humanity-based character of the principle of precautions in order to convert this ambiguity into a flexibility to apply the rules more effectively.\nThe LOAC, in general, aims to achieve a balance between military necessity and humanity. From this perspective, it is accepted that some harm will occur; on the\n10. Evans et al (fn 8) 50.\n11.

For example, Sari and Tinkler think that achieving a balance between humanity and necessity in the conduct of hostilities can be held ‘as the object and purpose of Additional Protocol I\n© 2023 The Author\nJournal compilation © 2023 Edward Elgar Publishing Ltd\nDownloaded from https://www.elgaronline.com/ at 07/16/2025 08:36:46PM\nvia University College London (UCL)\nThe application of the principle of precautions to cyber operations 7\nother hand, it should be minimized as much as possible. In other words, ‘[t]he thrust is not absolute elimination of the calamities of war (a goal which would manifestly be utopian), but relief from the tribulations of war “as much as possible” bearing in mind that war is fought to be won’. At this point, it sounds rational that these two notions should be balanced while applying the principles governing the conduct of hostilities.\nOn the other hand, considering the peculiarity of interconnectedness in cyberspace, this balance should be leaned toward humanity while applying the principle of precautions. There are some reasons in favour of such an interpretation. To begin with, the notion of ‘balance’ is significantly subjective. From a practitioner perspective, when the armed conflict starts, reality does not permit such a compromise, and the perception of ‘balance’ is determined by those on the battlefield. However, outside of the conflict, such a balance could be perceived differently by scholars or judges who need to evaluate the legality of such actions, and their views seem more ‘humanitarian’ to practitioners. As stated by Luban, ‘[f]or military lawyers, the starting point is military necessity, and the reigning assumption is that legal regulation of war must accommodate military necessity. For humanitarian lawyers, the starting point is human dignity and human rights’. As a result, such disparities in viewpoints considerably alter the perception of balance, and trying to achieve a balance in the principle of precautions seems to be a rhetorical word.\nApart from the subjectivity of balance depending on different perceptors, the nature of the LOAC principles inherently provides a lean toward either military necessity or humanity. While the principles of distinction and proportionality are more eligible to\nmore generally’. See A Sari and K Tinkler, ‘Collateral Damage and the Enemy’ (2019) British Yearbook of International Law 63. From the standpoint of this article, military necessity is held as a permission giving to a belligerent party in order to ‘apply any amount and kind of force to compel the complete submission of the enemy with the least possible expenditure of time, life, and money’ by not violating the LOAC. See The Hostage Case, Case No. 7 (United States v. Wilhelm List et al.), (Opinion and Judgment and Sentence) [1949] 1253 (‘The Hostage Case’). Pictet defines humanity as ‘a sentiment of active goodwill towards mankind’ by referring to Littré’s dictionary. See J Pictet, The Fundamental Principles of the Red Cross (1956) 143. By considering this definition, this article holds the principle of humanity as a ‘guiding principle that puts a brake on undertakings which might otherwise be justified by the principle of military necessity’.

The crux of the former principles is based on gaining military advantage on the battlefield, and the notion of military advantage ‘has a particular resonance with “military necessity”’. This naturally bends those principles’ interpretation in the direction of military necessity. On the other hand, the central tenet of the principle of precautions is based on the minimization of civilian harm. It obliges belligerent parties to take active or passive precautionary measures to mitigate risks, which derive from military operations, towards civilians and civilian property in armed conflicts. In line with this, it is not good enough for soldiers ‘merely not intending civilian harm’, but they also ‘must intend not to harm civilians’.\nGiven that the nature of the principles requires that they be construed by leaning towards one side, analyzing the principle of precautions by considering the balance poses a risk that it turns into an ‘illusory rule’. According to Schwarzenberger:\n[Illusory rules]... are merely a formal compromise between the standard of civilization and the necessities of war. Here, in fact the rule of force is supreme. Rules which expressly proclaim the necessities of war as an overriding constituent element or are emasculated by an ‘as far as possible’ clause illustrate this perhaps slightly hypocritical variant of the rules of warfare.\nThus, by turning the principle into an ‘illusory rule’, it would be very easy for belligerent parties to refrain from effectively applying the principle of precautions by putting terms such as ‘feasible’ or ‘unless circumstances do not permit’ on the table. To preclude such excuses, one should hold it as a rule that ‘sets limitations to warfare in cases in which considerations of civilization demand priority over military interest’. As correctly held by the Madagascar delegate, ‘[t]he article reflected a laudable desire to narrow the gap between the ideal and the possible, and to deal from a humanitarian standpoint with two opposite positions, namely, the aggressor’s and the victim’s’. Per this point of view, the application of the principle of precautions by taking ‘one small step’ toward humanity could be ‘one giant leap’ toward a more appropriate\n.

When the inherent bending of these principles toward military necessity and only their recognition as ‘principles’ in military manuals are considered, the consequence is admitted by Maurer that ‘[i]n more than one context, the balance between military “necessity” and protection concerns has heavily tilted towards military logics, and norms have been implicitly downgraded to mere discretionary guidance’.

In section 3, the precautions that shall be taken by the attacking side of the conflict according to Article 57 of Additional Protocol-I will be examined. In the first part of the section, target verification in cyber operations will be discussed, and some important questions will be answered, e.g., does technical superiority play any role on the precautionary level? Or what is the requisite level of certainty? In the second part, the choice of cyber means and methods will be addressed. The proportionality rule in precautions in planning and executing cyber attacks will be determined in the third part. Not only will key terms such as ‘military advantage’ and ‘incidental harm’ be discussed in that section, but also some grey areas, e.g., the consideration of indirect effects. The fourth part will explain effective warning before launching cyber attacks, and the final part will explain the least-danger rule. In the fourth section, precautions that shall be taken by a party that is subject to cyber operations will be addressed. In this chapter, the segregation of civilian and military objectives in cyberspace, the location of cyber military objectives, and other measures will be questioned, respectively.\n## 2 THE REGULATION OF THE PRINCIPLE OF PRECAUTIONS, BASIC TERMS AND RESPONSIBILITY\n### 2.1 The regulation of the principle of precautions\nWhile it is not stated conspicuously, the first implication of the principle of precautions can be found in Article 27 of the Hague Convention IV, in which it is stated that:\nIn sieges and bombardments all necessary steps must be taken to spare, as far as possible, buildings dedicated to religion, art, science, or charitable purposes, historic monuments, hospitals, and places where the sick and wounded are collected, provided they are not being used at the time for military purposes.\nIn the following process, the prohibition to launch an attack against civilians and to spare them as much as possible found a place in various official documents. However, the first binding regulation of the principle of precautions appeared in the AP-I,\n. ‘The principles of distinction, precautions and proportionality thus complement each other in a way that achieves a subtle balance between military necessity and humanitarian imperatives.’ See Sari and Tinkler (fn 21) 4.\n. International Conferences (The Hague), Hague Convention (IV) Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land and Its Annex: Regulations Concerning the Laws and Customs of War on Land, 18 October 1907.\n. See League of Nations Res ‘Protection of Civilian Populations Against Bombing from the Air in Case of War’ (30 September 1938). Later, more detailed rules were articulated in Articles 8, 9 and 11 of the Draft Rules for the Limitation of the Dangers incurred by the Civilian Population in Time of War (1956). Despite the fact that states did not adopt these rules, they had an impact on the rules codified in Additional Protocols. See S Watts, ‘Law-of-War Precautions: A Cautionary Note’ in RTP Alcala and E Talbot Jensen (eds), The Impact of Emerging Technologies on the Law of Armed Conflict (Oxford University Press, 2019) 116.\n© 2023 The Author\nJournal compilation © 2023 Edward Elgar Publishing Ltd\nDownloaded from https://www.elgaronline.com/ at 07/16/2025 08:36:46PM via University College London (UCL)\nThe Military Law and the Law of War Review, Vol. 61 No. 1\nin which it is stated that both attacking and defending parties shall take precautions to spare civilians and civilian objects in an armed conflict. At this point, for *jus in bello* cyberspace operations, the principle of precautions provides a twofold protection: the first comprises taking constant care while conducting cyber attacks ('precautions in attack'), and the second comprises taking feasible precautions in order to protect civilians from the effects of cyber attacks ('precautions against the effects of attacks') during armed conflicts. These precautions can also be named 'active' and 'passive' precautions ruled under Articles 57 and 58 of the AP-I.\nThe rules stated in Articles 57 and 58 are applied in times of armed conflicts, though the definition of 'armed conflict' is not provided in the Protocol. In this article, the definition given in the Tadic Decision, in which it was described as 'a resort to armed force between States or protracted armed violence between governmental authorities and organized armed groups or between such groups within a State',[39] is adopted. From this definition, it can be stated that there are two types of armed conflicts; 'between States' (international armed conflicts), and 'between governmental authorities and organized armed groups or between such groups' (non-international armed conflicts). In identifying the nature of the conflict, the status of the actors is the decisive factor.[40] The importance of this distinction is that while the AP-I, which is applicable to international armed conflicts, clearly states the obligation to take precautions, there is no clear provision which regulates the principle of precautions in Additional Protocol-II,[41] which is applicable to non-international armed conflicts. However, it does not prevent the application of the principle to the latter type of conflicts since it is stated in Article 13(1) of the AP-II that '[t]he civilian population and individual civilians shall enjoy general protection against the dangers arising from military operations'. Therefore, it is argued in the work of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) on Customary Rules that, by approving the customary nature of the principle for both international and non-international armed conflict, it is hard to abide by such a rule without taking any precaution.[42] Moreover, it is stated in the Tadic Decision that 'all necessary precautions should be taken to avoid injury, loss or damage to civilian populations' in all kinds of armed conflicts by referring to a resolution adopted by the United Nations General Assembly.[43] Finally, two recent treaties that are applicable to non-international armed conflicts explicitly regulate the principle of precautions.[44]\n39.

However, when these provisions are read together with Article 49, it might cause confusion in the first instance because while Article 49(3) clearly restricts the application of Section IV rules of the AP-I to operations conducted in the air or sea which have impacts on ‘civilians or civilian objects on land’, Article 57(4) seems to obligate parties to respect the principle of precautions in the conduct of these operations without any limitation. To solve this problem, one should deem Article 57(4) as ‘merely a restatement of one of the existing rules’. As Article 49(3) makes clear, the article does not affect those rules that are customary in nature and applicable to all types of military operations. Therefore, Article 57(4) does not contradict but rather ‘complement’ it.\nSince the principle of precautions applies to both operations and attacks, both of these terms should be clarified. At this point, military operations are ‘any movements, manoeuvres and other activities whatsoever carried out by the armed forces with a view to combat’. Therefore, all parties to the conflict should exercise constant care while conducting their military operations. For instance, if a tank driver harms civilian property while maneuvering the vehicle, he/she will be responsible due to the breach of the principle of precautions. From this perspective, if a perpetrator destroys a civilian network while conducting cyber exploitation against either a civilian or military cyber system, he/she will bear responsibility. However, military attacks require a certain threshold since they are violent acts causing death, injury, damage, or destruction – or at least intending to do so. As a result, all military attacks are kinds of military operations but vice versa would not be true. Therefore, while cyber operation can be defined as ‘the employment of cyber capabilities to achieve objectives in or through cyberspace’, cyber attack is ‘a cyber operation, whether offensive or defensive, that is reasonably expected to cause injury or death to persons or damage or destruction to objects’. In light of this, cyber attack is a special kind of cyber operation that results in violent effects. However, cyber attacks require a broader understanding because damage to objects may occur as a secondary effect of cyber operations. Therefore, the present author agrees with the approach of the majority of the International Group of Experts (the Experts), who prepared the Tallinn Manual, that cyber operations that result in the replacement of a component by having an impact on the functionality of an object fall within the ambit of attack because, while these kinds of operations do not damage an object in the first instance, their effects in later phases reach the threshold of attack by causing physical harm.\n.

At this point, the applicability of international law to cyber operations is recognized by states and international organizations. Also, there is a certain difference between a cyber operation and an attack, and not all precautionary measures are applicable to all kinds of cyber operations.\n## 2.2 Constant care\nAccording to Article 57(1) of the AP-I, the attacking party shall always take ‘constant care’ to spare civilians and civilian objects while conducting military operations. The term ‘constant care’ is clarified in the HPCR Manual Commentary by stating that ‘there are no exceptions from the duty to seek to spare the civilian population, civilians and civilian objects’. Therefore, constant care obliges all levels of the armed forces who are responsible for planning, ordering or executing a cyber operation to always consider the results of it and try to minimize its effects on civilians.\nThe ‘constant care’ obligation is necessary for cyber operations. Those who are involved in the operation should always be aware of the foreseeable effects of operations on the civilian population and property and try to minimize these effects as much as possible. For this reason, it is not enough to demonstrate due care in the planning stage; this obligation extends to all stages of the operation in which civilians might be affected. In other words, these people should have ‘situational awareness at all times’. The concept of situational awareness is explained in the Allied Joint Doctrine for Cyberspace Operations by describing it as ‘a combination of a near real-time updated RCP [Recognised Cyberspace Picture], analysis and information management’. Although the obligation is constrained by the execution stage of an operation as described in the article, the effects of the attack can continue. For example, in the\n.

Although Jensen notes that this ‘at least implicates the constant-care standard and informs State practice on the issue’, the present author considers that the possible effects of the cyber operations after their execution are better understood 10 years later, so states should seek to stop or at least limit the effects of operations after their military objective is accomplished.\nOn the other hand, the application of the rule in cyberspace poses a significant hurdle since almost all cyber operations might affect or harm civilian cyber infrastructure to some extent. However, after all feasible precautions have been taken by an attacker, the relevant rule will be proportionality. If the effects of the operation on civilians are not excessive compared to the anticipated military advantage, then the attacking party may continue to carry out cyber operations. However, the calculation may be difficult because of the time-sensitivity. Planned operations give more chance to the attacking party to take better precautions, though time-sensitive ones generally do not permit sufficient time to implement more suitable precautions. Although the impact of such a condition on precautions is not deniable, it does not give permission to the attacker to deviate from the principle because the constant care obligation necessitates parties to take feasible precautions in all circumstances.\nThe second significant hurdle might be the secretive nature of cyberspace since ambiguity is at the centre of cyber warfare. Even though attribution may be difficult in that domain and the perpetrator of cyber acts that violate the LOAC cannot be easily found, parties to the conflict should obey the rules of the LOAC by considering warrior ethics. From this perspective, cyber warriors should always seek ways to mitigate risks towards civilians in good faith since ‘[r]espect for LOAC obligations is the essential touchstone for that ethical foundation’. This ethical foundation serves for better protection of civilians, which is an inherent objective of the LOAC.\nLast but not least, the ‘constant care’ obligation should not be accepted as limited to this article. It involves all phases of operations and attacks, which are carried out by both attacking and defending parties. For this reason, it has a guidance function while examining all provisions of Articles 57 and 58.\n## 2.3 Feasibility\nArticle 57 obliges parties to take ‘feasible’ precautions in order to minimize the effects of an attack on civilians and civilian objects. In the Official Commentary of Article 57, it is stated that those precautions are ‘everything that was practicable or practically possible, taking into account all the circumstances at the time of the attack, including\n.

At this point, every situation has its unique features, and those responsible for an attack should adapt various precautions by considering the characteristics of the situation. For example, an attacker party should map the target network through exploitation operations if it is connected to other civilian networks.71 In such situations, LOAC not only permits cyber espionage but also obligates a belligerent party to conduct these operations. However, such operations require a certain level of technical expertise, and in the absence of that, such a network should not be exploited.72 Despite such expertise, some mistakes may occur in the 'fog of war'.73 At this point, a commander who took 'all due measures' is not responsible for this harm.74 Those measures can be identified by different factors such as available cyber means, time sensitivity, the cyber defence system of the enemy, the characteristics of the target, intelligence assets, the expertise of the attacking team, the loyalty of the enemy of to the LOAC, and available assets and vulnerabilities of the enemy.75 However, even if feasible precautions are taken, unintended results may occur for various reasons, such as failure of the intelligence system, dysfunction of the technology, or unexpected changes in tactical conditions.76 For instance, a commander might prepare a map of a cyber network before conducting an attack, but the virus unintentionally spreads among the civilian infrastructure, which has a connection with the military network.77 At this point, while deciding on whether the principle of precautions is respected or not, one should not focus on outcomes, but compliance should be measured by the process in which an\n68.

For instance, if an attacker has advanced cyber capabilities that make it possible to disrupt an electrical grid without harming civilians but prefers to carry out an attack by conventional means – which results in civilian damage – it cannot claim that its adversary does not use the same level of technology to refrain from harming civilians. Thus, it is true that each party has a responsibility ‘within its means or methods or its capability’ as stated by the Indian delegate.\nEven if the commander has advanced cyber weapons, he/she may try to spare them for use during later stages of the conflict by taking military considerations into account. Therefore, it is permitted for the military commander in the Naval Manual of Ecuador to use alternative methods ‘in light of all the facts known or reasonably available to him, including the need to conserve resources and complete the mission successfully’. However, if it is understood that using less advanced weapons will result in excessive collateral damage, then they should either use advanced ones or cancel the attack.\nOn the other hand, the determination of feasibility on a contextual basis should not be used to assuage the burden from the shoulders of the attacker. For example, the use of white phosphorus shells near al-Wafa hospital, where patients have serious injuries and need long-term care, by the Israeli armed forces was deemed a violation of Articles 57(2)(b) and (c) of the AP-I. It was stated that those who were responsible for the attack should be aware of ‘all the facts and circumstances’. For this reason, while conducting a cyber operation against a system in which some medical records may be located, the attacking party should take special care. The same is valid for facilities such as dams, where dangerous forces are located.\n## 2.4 Responsibility\nThe wording of Article 57 restricts its applicability to ‘those who plan or decide upon an attack’. Because of this wording, some states have expressed reservations about Article 57, claiming that it only applies to ‘commanding officers at the battalion or group level and those of higher ranks’. Nonetheless, every soldier who breaches obligations imposed by the LOAC bears individual criminal responsibility for his/her acts when such crimes are committed with ‘intent and knowledge’. At this point, it does\n.

Also, it might be possible to operate in smaller groups in different types of warfare, such as national liberation wars or transnational armed conflicts. In line with this, the rule should be applied at ‘whatever level the regulated functions are being performed’ since every soldier who conducts military operations against an adversary by aiming to obtain military advantage participates in the decision-making process in the theatre of war. As a result, individuals ‘who have the authority and practical possibility to affect the course of an attack’ should be held accountable for cyber activities.\nIn cyberspace, it may be very hard to calculate the effects of an attack by planners or decision makers since the interconnectedness of civilian and military networks prevents the attacking party from properly calculating the effects of an attack and from taking feasible precautions in order to minimize them. Also, the velocity of computer systems operating at high speed makes it difficult to predict the indirect effects of cyber attacks. As it is stated in the ICRC Expert Meeting:\nOwing to how the internet is designed and operates, there will always be the risk of other systems or networks being affected. The reason is that volumetric attacks can end up using all available channel capacity, which would affect the networks on the path to the target. This has happened in the past, with powerful DDoS attacks launched against specific targets and affecting entire internet infrastructure providers.\nHowever, the unpredictability of effects does not relieve the responsibility of all levels of command while conducting operations. According to Watkin, operational factors cannot be put forward in order not to take feasible precautions in today’s trend, which pursues to compromise ‘human rights-like accountability frameworks with operational decision making during armed conflict’. Accordingly, all members of the armed forces who are part of operations in cyberspace should do everything feasible within their limits.\nWhile assessing the individual responsibility of officers, they should be judged by how much they know about a certain subject. The well-known example is the Rendulic Decision, in which the Nuremberg Tribunal held that ‘the “scorched earth” policy in\n Sandoz, Swinarski and Zimmermann (eds) (fn 3) 2197; APV Rogers, ‘General Report-Conduct of Combat and Risks Run by the Civilian Population’ (1982) 21 Mil.

For this reason, later evidence which showed that ‘the danger did not actually exist’$^{98}$ cannot be used to convict the commander since he ‘acted within the limits of honest judgment on the basis of the conditions prevailing at the time’.$^{99}$ This is crucial considering the interconnectivity of cyberspace since cyber attacks might affect civilian networks unexpectedly despite a commander’s employment of the advanced technology to conduct constant surveillance over a network.$^{100}$ At this point, the responsibility arising out of a cyber attack would not go beyond what the defendant knew at the time of the attack.\nOn the other hand, one needs to distinguish misinformation from misconception. Misconception of the nature of the target might occur because of cognitive bias, which misdirects attackers by analyzing information ‘in a manner that supports their pre-existing beliefs or mental frameworks’.$^{101}$ States should employ a variety of techniques such as ‘training and education, red teaming procedures, specific positive identification (PID) policies for targeting, use of structured analytic techniques, and other analytic tradecraft practices’ in order for this not to result in civilian damage.$^{102}$ Despite the fact that states are keen to protect soldiers in such situations,$^{103}$ inflicting civilian harm due to biased decisions does not very well fit with the notion of ‘honest judgement’.\nLastly, those who undertake cyber operations may be fully aware of the results of their actions owing to their technical expertise since cyberspace requires unique understanding compared to traditional domains. If a higher commander issues an order to launch a cyber operation without being aware of the outcomes in good faith, inferior commanders will be responsible for such intentional conduct. However, if a commander is aware that he lacks sufficient information about a target, he should either change the concept of the attack or refrain from issuing such an order.$^{104}$ Should an operation continue to be carried out while being aware of this insufficiency, responsibility arises.\n# 3 PRECAUTIONS IN ATTACK\n## 3.1 Target verification\nIt is stated in Article 57(2) of the AP-I that:\n(a) those who plan or decide upon an attack shall:\n(i) do everything feasible to verify that the objectives to be attacked are neither civilians nor civilian objects and are not subject to special protection but are military objectives within the\n97.

For this reason, an object that is military in nature should not be subject to attack if it does not effectively contribute to the military capacity of an enemy.^[107]^\nWhile only Article 52(2) of the AP-I has found its place in the provision, lawful targets also include people who can be made the object of direct cyber attacks. According to the LOAC, various categories of people can be held as lawful targets. The first one consists of combatants who are members of the armed forces and have a right to directly participate in hostilities.^[108]^ Even though they are lawful targets, they have a right to be treated as prisoners of war when they are captured by the enemy.^[109]^\nThe second category includes direct participants in hostilities. Although they are civilian in nature, they will be accepted as lawful targets if they meet three cumulative criteria which are: threshold of harm, direct causation and belligerent nexus.^[110]^ Those people are lawful targets 'for such time as they take a direct part in hostilities',^[111]^ and if they are captured, they cannot benefit from prisoner of war status.\nThe third category, though there is a discussion on it, consists of members of an organized armed group that is a belligerent party in an armed conflict. They are 'individuals whose continuous function involves the preparation, execution, or command of acts or operations amounting to direct participation in hostilities'.^[112]^\n105.

The result of this distinction is that those who directly participate in hostilities lose their protected status only for a limited period of time, but the last category of individuals loses it ‘as long as they remain members’, and this membership renders them lawful targets ‘even before he or she first carries out a hostile act’.\nAfter it was stated in the Official Commentary that the military commander does not need to have personal knowledge, it was argued that even if there is a ‘slight doubt’, additional information shall be obtained. By supporting it, Rogers points out that ‘[i]n the event of doubt about the nature of the target, an attack should not be carried out, with a possible exception where failure to prosecute the attack would put attacking forces in immediate danger’. However, this approach is challenged by some states, which claim that the determination should be ‘substantial doubt’ to suspend an attack and require supplementary information. In the same vein, various authors claimed that conducting military operations without having a doubt on the nature of a target is not a reasonable expectation in the fog of war. From this perspective, there is always some doubt as an inherent characteristic of combat. On the other hand, the present author thinks that the Official Commentary should be interpreted as the aim of a commander. By stating the ‘slight doubt’ requirement, the commentary obligates them to take better precautions even if it is possible to erase this doubt. This is approved by military practice, in which attacks are cancelled when combatants are not ‘certain’ or ‘100 percent sure of their aiming point’. According to Parks, the US achieved this level of accuracy during the Linebacker II campaign by constantly confirming the nature of targets, implementing rules set by the Strategic Air Command, and issuing bomb damage assessments after each attack. Despite the fact that such high-level precautions sometimes pose substantial risks to the combatants’ lives, he acknowledges that they are important not only in terms of legality but also for achieving military and political objectives. By considering such positive outcomes, a commander should be sure enough that he/she made reasonable efforts to verify the nature of the target in cyberspace.\n113. Ibid.\n114. Ibid at 34, 71.\n115.

At this point, cyber attack should be limited to that component, which is military in nature. If it is not possible, then the attack should be cancelled. However, this should not be equated with being ‘perfectly familiar with the network’ since such an interpretation is not appropriate with the term ‘feasible’.\n## 3.2 Choice of cyber means and methods\nAfter the nature of the target is verified, the next step will be to compose an operational plan that will have a minimum effect on civilians. At this point, it is stated in Article 57 (2)(a)(ii) of the AP-I that members of the armed forces should ‘take all feasible precautions in the choice of means and methods of attack with a view to avoiding, and in any event to minimising, incidental loss or civilian life, injury to civilians and damage to civilian objects’. This means that even if an attack is proportionate, parties to the conflict should be careful in their choice of means and methods in order to minimize the effects of attacks as much as possible while still aiming to obtain maximum military advantage. At this point, an attacking party should produce a plan that promises to give the most efficient operational and legal results.\nIt is important to define ‘cyber means’ and ‘methods’. Cyber means are defined as ‘cyber weapons and their associated cyber systems’ in the Tallinn Manual. At this point, cyber weapons are kinds of cyber means, but the latter includes a broader category. Cyber methods, on the other hand, are defined as ‘the cyber tactics, techniques, and procedures by which hostilities are conducted’. Whilst cyber means are concerned with which tools should be employed to carry out cyber operations, cyber methods are concerned with how these operations should be carried out. Based on this viewpoint, while botnets are a type of cyber means, the DDoS attack that is conducted by botnets can be considered a type of cyber method.\nThere is no weapon or method that is specifically prohibited in the provision. It only obliges parties to take feasible precautions by choosing appropriate means and methods; thereby, a commander will not be responsible for causing civilian harm. However, the rule does not require parties to choose means and methods that may decrease their expected military advantage. Even if alternative means and methods are not used because of this concern, a planned cyber attack must abide by other principles such as distinction and proportionality. On the other hand, if choosing different means and methods may change the degree of damage by producing ‘equivalent effects’ upon the target, then alternative means or methods shall be selected.

However, this may result in civilian deaths who live in the vicinity of the facility. At this point, if an attacking party has available means to conduct a cyber attack, it shall use them against the system or computers in the facility to stop belligerent attacks. Additionally, military personnel’s expertise with those new technologies is crucial. The concern was raised in the Eritrea-Ethiopia Claims Commission. Even though Eritrea refused Ethiopia’s allegations that some of its aircraft intentionally attacked civilians, the inexperience of Eritrean pilots in using ‘computerized aiming systems’, which led to the failure to target military objectives, was held as a violation of Article 57 of the AP-I. Lastly, a ‘target list’ can be prepared and constantly reviewed by belligerent parties in order to determine which type of weapon should be used to decrease civilian harm by considering the characteristics of the target. For example, the bombardment of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) compound by the Israeli Armed Forces, which resulted in extensive damage and endangered the lives of many civilians, was accepted as reckless conduct and a violation of Article 57(2)(a)(ii) of the AP-I since it was executed while being aware of its importance for civilians. However, in the Vietnam War, the US employed fragmentation bombs that had limited effects on the target to execute attacks against anti-aircraft batteries; since these batteries were located inside dikes, the army tried to refrain from damaging them.\nThe accuracy and range of weapons also have a particular importance in the execution of attacks. If a target can be destroyed by accurate weapons, then it does not make sense to use dumb bombs or other means whose effects may not be calculated properly or limited. In this sense, the US practice in the Linebacker II campaign is important. During the campaign, the B-52s that have wide-range effects were employed because of weather conditions and the limited number of the more precise weapons. But to keep the collateral damage to a minimum, the B-52s were used against targets that were either sufficiently large or in military-industrial complexes. Other objectives requiring pinpoint strikes, such as bridges and railroad yards, were hit by more precise weapons when weather conditions permitted, which was limited to 12 hours during the 12-day campaign.\nAs such practice in a highly interconnected battle arena demonstrates, cyber means and weapons should be used against adversaries while always considering their accuracy and range. When it would not be possible to precisely damage a cyber target that is interconnected with a civilian network, they should be used against military cyber networks, or at least those networks whose destruction does not have a significant impact on civilians. In this manner, a cyber mean can be designed to affect only a specific type of system, as it was in the Stuxnet incident, in which malware only affected the SCADA systems.\n.

The term refers to malware that is able to ‘recognize the environment it finds itself in and then execute itself only if the target system precisely matches that environment’. Recent events demonstrate that states follow this trend by using precise cyber means. At this point, the Russia-Ukraine War is of particular importance, and it should be carefully examined.\nIn the report prepared by Microsoft (the Microsoft Report), it is claimed that:\nRussian cyber tactics in the war have differed from those deployed in the NotPetya attack against Ukraine in 2017. That attack used ‘wormable’ destructive malware that could jump from one computer domain to another and hence cross borders into other countries. Russia has been careful in 2022 to confine destructive ‘wiper software’ to specific network domains inside Ukraine itself. But the recent and ongoing destructive attacks themselves have been sophisticated and more widespread than many reports recognize. And the Russian army is continuing to adapt these destructive attacks to changing war needs, including by coupling cyberattacks with the use of conventional weapons.\nThis passage raises two concerns. First, which types of cyber means are used? Second, excluding other considerations such as political or military ones, why did the Russians allegedly employ such means in an armed conflict while adhering to the LOAC?\nAs an answer to the first question, the Microsoft Report lists cyber means that were used or are in use in the Russia-Ukraine War:\n1. WhisperGate/WhisperKill\n2. FoxBlade, aka HermeticWiper\n3. DesertBlade\n4. CaddyWiper\n5. Lasainraw, aka IsaacWiper\n6. FiberLake, aka DoubleZero\n7. SonicVote, aka HermeticRansom\n8.

Even though the Microsoft Report does not give detail about number 5, another report states that it deletes data from physical and logical drives, though its impact is limited. Except for number 8, the effects\n. E Lawson and K Mačák, ‘Avoiding Civilian Harm from Military Cyber Operations during Armed Conflicts’ (ICRC Expert Meeting, 2020) 26.\n. Ibid.\n.

This brings an important issue to the surface. Even though the debate exists, operations causing such damage do not constitute attacks in terms of *lex lata*. Therefore, it would not be possible to apply Article 57 (2)(a)(ii) to those malwares since the rule encompasses means of warfare that are ‘used, designed, or intended to be used to conduct a cyber attack’. Then the question would be why Russia needs to employ such discriminatory cyber means.\nFrom the present author’s perspective, the war demonstrated that the key benefit of using cyber means in warfare is their adaptability, instead of previous assumptions that cyber operations provide a belligerent party an advantage owing to their low cost or non-attributability. As stated in the report, Russia adapted such means to ‘changing war needs’. This adaptation should be seen from two perspectives: cyber and kinetic. The former is important from a technical standpoint, and the latter is important from a legal standpoint, but both of them need to be examined because of their importance from a military standpoint.\nEven though it does not have a direct relationship with the legality of cyber means in terms of Article 57(2)(a)(ii), the technical standing point is important to understand why parties adopt cyber means in armed conflicts. Every new step in technology has the potential to threaten the kinetic weapon supremacy of an adversary. For example, the invention of a new type of surface-to-air missile system can erase the advantage of the adversary’s aircraft, and the attacking party needs to make a huge investment to improve its aircraft and produce new ones to establish a new squadron. On the other hand, the adaptability of cyber means makes it possible for past used malware to escape from such quick elimination. By adding some extra codes, a cyber weapon can be adjusted based on a new type of cyber security measure, and such modification can turn it into a new type of weapon. As stated by the ICRC, ‘it is possible for offensive cyber capabilities to be reverse-engineered or repurposed so that they can be reused. This is also the case for some traditional weapon systems, but the technical characteristics of cyberspace raise these concerns in a unique manner’. This uniqueness has been and continues to be demonstrated in the Russia-Ukraine War. Numerous reports claim that Russia used or is using malware by modifying previously used ones. In other words, cyber security updates also bring updates to those malwares, and they are adapted to changing needs in the cyber environment. For example, AcidRain, a wiper malware used to disrupt the VIASAT satellite, shares some characteristics with VPNFilter, a kind of malware used by Russia-backed cyber-organized groups in 2018. Also, such modifications do not have to take a long time. Shortly after the intrusion of WhisperGate into Ukrainian systems and its detection by cyber security companies, Russia altered it and developed a new type of malware, Hermeticwiper, that ‘has some similarities to the earlier WhisperGate’. This shows that detecting malware and taking defensive measures against it do not make such malware useless, but certain parts of the codes can still be used by belligerents to improve their cyber capabilities owing to their adaptability.\n.

Figure 1 above, depicted by Microsoft, shows how critical infrastructures are subject to cyber operations as the Russian tanks roll toward cities. Additionally, the fact that certain facilities, which are being physically attacked, were subject to cyber operations, demonstrates that the coordination is not general but rather as specific as possible. As a result, every operation that is part of an attack has to be evaluated within the meaning of the LOAC, and this necessitates evaluating the cyber means stated above to be employed by respecting relevant rules, including the principle of precautions.\nWhile choosing cyber methods, the first relevant factor is the timing of the attack to minimize collateral damage.[154] During World War II, Allied Forces conducted attacks on military factories at times when there were a minimum number of civilian workers present.[155] In that vein, for example, while carrying out cyber attacks against dual-use objects, the belligerent party may execute them at night or early in the morning when the targets are not intensively used by civilians.\n153.

If a target is located in a place that is mostly used by civilians and there is a significant level of risk of harm occurring, the attacker shall use the most accurate weapons available or must refrain from conducting such an attack. At this point, there is a discussion on whether the Internet can be held as a lawful target because, while it might make an effective contribution to the military capacity of the enemy, it is mostly used by civilians. Even though it is argued that if an attacking party believes that it can get enough military advantage, a cyber attack against the Internet is permissible, another opinion accepts the Internet as a civilian object and prohibits such an attack. According to the latter opinion, even if it is intended to carry out a cyber attack against the Internet, it should be limited to ‘individual networks, servers, routers, links, and other computer facilities that are used for military purposes and which are likely to be connected to the Internet’. By accepting the latter interpretation, the present author considers that if it is possible to considerably limit the effects of the attack, especially by considering the dual nature of cyberspace, then an attack may be conducted. If not, it will be in breach of the rule.\nWhilst some authors argue that the choice of means and methods only come onto the scene when there is a similar advantage, the present author thinks that the criteria should not be applied strictly. As stated by Borghard and Lonergan while discussing coercion in cyberspace, the attacking party tries to apply less harmful ways, such as disruptive operations rather than destructive ones, in order to better negotiate at later stages since the system may be restored more easily when the former type of means are used. At this point, the belligerent party should choose the type of means or methods to achieve the intended outcomes by considering the post-conflict situation. There is no doubt that a large number of civilian deaths will prolong the conflict, even if the attacks are perfectly legal. The bombing of Radio-Television of Serbia by NATO, which sparked so many debates about the legality of the campaign, may be an example of the adverse impact of such conduct. To Kolb, even if the station can be assumed as a military objective, it was repaired in three hours, and 16 civilians were killed because of the attack. By taking lessons from this example, it can be stated that belligerent parties should always consider alternatives, even if a designed cyber attack seems lawful. In such a case, disrupting broadcasting by cyber operation might produce better consequences, even though it seems that destruction promises more advantage. In these kinds of situations, perpetrators should always keep the humanitarian aims of the LOAC in mind.\n.

However, both of these provisions have similar meanings by prohibiting attacks conducted against a legitimate target if it seems that ‘excessive’ collateral damage will occur, whether the cyber attack is being planned or has already been planned. At this point, there should be a balance between military advantage and civilian harm.\n## 3.3.1 Military advantage\nThe advantage should be military in nature rather than merely moral, political or financial. For example, conducting cyber attacks against specific sectors of a country, such as the oil industry, which is vital for Arab countries, by considering that such an operation against ‘war-sustaining objects’ will decrease the military effort of an enemy is not appropriate since ‘almost every civilian activity might be construed by the enemy as indirectly sustaining the war effort’ as stated by Dinstein. Also, it is stated in the Official Commentary that this type of advantage can only be gained by the annihilation of an enemy or gaining ground; the transformation of the notion of war, however, changed this paradigm. While the former can be categorized as an overstatement, the latter seems to be an understatement. Hence, as a moderate approach, the HPCR Manual Commentary points out that ‘any consequence of an attack which directly enhances friendly military operations or hinders those of the enemy’ should be included within the ambit of military advantage.\nCyber attacks should be assessed as a whole while aiming to obtain military advantage. As stated by Fenrick and approved by declarations of numerous states, proportionality calculations cannot be made on either ‘a bullet-by-bullet basis’ or ‘the basis of attacks on individual military objectives’.

At this point, the planning stage has significant importance, and an attack should be judged by looking at the bigger picture. Although it was claimed that people who give an order will bear responsibility rather than those who execute the attack in such a case, if it is apparent that the targeted network is civilian in nature after the attack is initiated, it should be cancelled or a confirmation should be demanded by the perpetrator from higher ranks in light of changing circumstances. Lastly, assessing a cyber attack as a whole should not be interpreted as having a purpose to obtain military advantage by taking the ‘full context of a war strategy’ into account. Otherwise, all cyber attacks, whether they incur excessive civilian damages or not, can be deemed legal in defiance of the aims of the LOAC.\n## 3.3.2 Collateral damage\nCollateral damage can be described as an ‘incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians and damage to civilian objects or other protected objects or a combination thereof, caused by an attack on a lawful target’. At this point, collateral damage occurs while conducting cyber attacks against military targets without deliberately targeting civilians and civilian property.\nCollateral damage includes both the direct and indirect effects of a cyber attack. While the former type of effects are those that ‘are the immediate, first order consequence of a military action (weapons employment results, etc.), unaltered by intervening events or mechanisms’; the latter type of effects are ‘the delayed or displaced second-, third-, and higher-order consequences of action, created through intermediate events or mechanisms’. Since cyber operations are carried out at the logical layer of cyberspace, their first-order effects have an impact on data, programs, or software; nevertheless, such effects are not included in the aforementioned definition of collateral damage. Yet, ‘indirect effects may be aimed at the other layers of cyberspace, or at creating other higher-order effects in other domains’, and thereby such effects can raise the level of collateral damage. Therefore, the inclusion of indirect effects in the concept of collateral harm is crucial. However, due to the complexity involved in calculating second- or higher-order effects, such an inclusion also poses a significant challenge in cyberspace. As acknowledged in the Allied Doctrine:\nSince cyberspace is a global domain, there is a risk of COs [cyberspace operations] having an impact outside the joint operations area. COs can create undesired effects on our own\n. Quéguiner (fn 154) 804.\n. Ibid at 804–805.\n.

This risk, as with similar risks in other domains, is factored into the planning.\nEven though it is not necessary to make certain calculations, effects which are too remote or beyond the scope of reasonable certainty will not cause any responsibility for combatants. Lastly, collateral damage does not contain minor effects such as stress, irritation or inconvenience. All cyber attacks might cause stress or inconvenience to some extent, but that does not make them illegal.\n## 3.3.3 Excessive collateral damage\nBelligerent parties should always consider whether the expected military advantage is proportionate compared to the anticipated collateral damage. At this point, the terms ‘extensive’ and ‘excessive’ should be differentiated. In the Official Commentary, it was argued that conducting attacks against lawful targets should not create ‘extensive destruction of civilian objects’ despite the fact that there is no reference to such a limitation in the Additional Protocols. The collateral damage can be justified even if it is at the ‘extensive’ level on the condition that the nominated target is important enough. Although civilian casualties are ‘regrettable and tragic consequences of the war’, those losses do not ‘in themselves establish liability … under international law’ as stated by the Eritrea-Ethiopia Claims Commission.\nExcessiveness cannot be determined by approaching it as a mathematical formula, despite the fact that ‘[f]ifty civilians killed for one suspected combatant’ is given as a ‘textbook example of a violation of the proportionality principle’ by some authors. However, as stated in the NATO Bombing Report:\nIt is much easier to formulate the principle of proportionality in general terms than it is to apply it to a particular set of circumstances because the comparison is often between unlike quantities and values. One cannot easily assess the value of innocent human lives as opposed to capturing a particular military objective.\nHence, excessiveness should be evaluated depending upon the comparison between two values, namely, collateral damage and military advantage. Although it is hard to estimate excessiveness in cyberspace and to prevent it, there are methods to make a reasonable assessment. It is stated in the Allied Doctrine that:\nCOs [cyberspace operations] will be conducted according to the operation plan. As such, SCEPVA [Sovereign Cyber Effects Provided Voluntarily by Allies], when authorised, might give the commander alternative options to create effects. These options are integrated,\n.

At this point, the determination of the effects and excessiveness of an action will be based on the good faith of the combatant, its reasonableness and the circumstances in which the cyber attack is planned and executed.\n## 3.4 Effective warning\nIt is stated in Article 57(2)(c) of the AP-I that ‘effective advance warning shall be given of attacks which may affect the civilian population, unless circumstances do not permit’. The first appearance of this rule can be traced back to the Lieber Code, in which it was stated that:\nCommanders, whenever admissible, inform the enemy of their intention to bombard a place, so that the noncombatants, and especially the women and children, may be removed before the bombardment commences. But it is no infraction of the common law of war to omit thus to inform the enemy. Surprise may be a necessity.\nAs it can be observed from the article, if a party plans to conduct a surprise cyber attack, it does not need to give any warning so as not to endanger the success of the operation. Surprise may be necessary in some cases, such as when there is a risk of a pre-emptive cyber attack or the exposure of a broader campaign. The Tallinn Manual illustrates this by saying that:\nConsider, for example, a cyber operation involving placement of a kill-switch into the target computer’s control system, to be activated on the occurrence of some future event or after the passage of a specified period. A warning that would give the enemy an opportunity to locate and neutralise the device need not be given.\nTherefore, giving warning is limited to appropriate circumstances since an attacker may have special reasons that justify not giving any warning. A relevant consideration could be the equation comparing the level of military advantage between situations in which giving occurs and those in which it does not. If the gap justifies civilian harm, then the attacking party does not need to give a warning in advance.\nIf it is expected that the cyber attack will exclusively affect civilian objects and not have any impact on civilians, then giving warning will not be necessary. By approving this point, the Australian Military Manual states that the warning can be directed at civilians, who bear the dangers posed by an intended attack, or at responsible authorities. In that vein, if harm to civilians is expected, then they can be warned in many ways through\n. NATO (fn 59) 26 para 3.32 (explanations added).\n.

There is no necessity to issue a warning in a formal way. If it is effective, it can be conveyed by any means that are available to the attacking party, such as in a written or verbal way. Sending voice recordings or text messages through WhatsApp, for instance, might be a feasible precaution if it is deemed to be effective.\nThe term ‘effective’ is not clarified, neither in the AP-I nor in its commentary. Even though the Australian Military Manual suggests adopting ‘commonsense’ to achieve effectiveness, this does not clarify the notion but adds extra blurriness to it. On the other hand, the term ‘effective’ is defined in the dictionary as ‘producing a decided, decisive, or desired effect’. Based on this definition, it can at least be said that in order for a warning to be effective, it should aim to reduce collateral damage to a minimum. To accomplish this, the content of the warning should be reasonably clear and specific so that civilians have a chance to secure themselves from the effects of an attack. Both of these terms should be determined based on the context. In terms of clarity, rather than giving technical details, belligerent parties may underline the effects of cyber attacks and provide guidelines to civilians on how to protect themselves from such effects. In terms of specificity, there is no requirement to give a specific warning for every situation; the warning may be general in a way that provides a list of cyber objectives that might be targeted. Overall, there is no one correct method to issuing effective warnings, but they should be tailored to diverse scenarios to protect civilians.\nWarnings can be conducted through an enemy if it makes the warning more effective. However, such a warning can also be used as a ruse of war. For example, ‘a false announcement of a cyber attack affecting dual-use systems might prove militarily useful in causing the enemy to take its military assets off-line’. Nevertheless, if it is expected that such a warning causes civilians to ignore future real warnings and to put them in danger, then this will be prohibited. Further, the belligerent party should not give a warning in order to spread terror among civilians. As stated in Article 51(2) of the AP-I, ‘[a]cts or threats of violence the primary purpose of which is to spread terror among the civilian population are prohibited’. For this reason, warnings given through cyberspace that aim to ‘frighten or cause panic among residents or compel them to leave their homes for reasons other than their safety’ are forbidden. Although there is always a danger for civilians to be exposed to fake news via the Internet without the knowledge of the attacking party, it is also their obligation to search for the truth.\n194.

Therefore, this rule is also known as ‘the lesser of two evils’. The rationale behind the article is simple: While a commander is trying to get the maximum effect on the military capacity of the enemy, he/she should seek an option which has minimum effect on civilians. The example given in the Official Commentary is that ‘[i]nstead of attacking railway stations, which are usually located in towns, the railway lines were hit at crucial points, but away from inhabited areas; the same action was taken with respect to roads’. By analogy, it can be stated that cyber attacks should be conducted against specific networks of electricity distribution facilities rather than the whole power station. However, the rule comes into scene when two different options promise military advantage at the same level. Otherwise, the attack is subject to other provisions and principles, i.e., proportionality.\nThere are two critical discussions to have while inflicting the least amount of harm on civilians and civilian property. First, whether or not causing harm to civilians and civilian property is equally important. At this point, while discussing the Kosovo Conflict, General Clark states that ‘[w]e weren’t going to disregard risks to civilians but the alternative to taking risks with property damage was that we might ultimately have to put our troops in on the ground’. From this example, it seems that objects have less value than civilian lives in practice. However, cyber operations are more likely to have effects on objects than on people. Therefore, the relevant discussion may be whether all objects have the same value in cyberspace. At this point, Henderson offers to determine the value of objects by various factors such as ‘the “utility” of the object, the objects “replace-ability”, and the cost of replacement’. In that vein, in terms of utility, it may be preferable to have an impact on financial records rather than medical data in cyberspace. The second discussion is whether belligerent parties put civilians at greater risk than their own troops. Although some states and scholars adopt the opinion that the security of armed forces should be included in military advantage, another approach holds that the armed forces must accept the risks posed by combat actions, and those risks should not be borne by civilians. The present author considers that an attacking party who conducts cyber attacks against an enemy already minimizes the dangers of combat for its own troops because of their remoteness\n.

Therefore, it should not disregard civilian damage by claiming force protection.\nBeyond mere humanitarianism, it is a military reality to target legitimate objectives to the maximum extent while harming civilians to the minimum. Carnahan states that '[t]he wise military officer will try to concentrate firepower on key military objectives and to keep to a minimum the collateral damage not only for humanitarian reasons, but also because munitions that injure civilians are wasted munitions'.[214] When the humanitarian impacts of such 'wasted munitions' are considered along with their military value, it is a well-known fact that when civilian harm increases, the likelihood of success of the mission decreases, so belligerent parties should aim to put the least amount of risk on civilians if there is an opportunity to refrain from it while gaining a military advantage at the same level, or at least another option that significantly decreases the military advantage.[215]\n# 4 PRECAUTIONS AGAINST THE EFFECTS OF CYBER OPERATIONS\n## 4.1 General remarks\nIt is stated in Article 58 of the AP-I that:\nThe Parties to the conflict shall, to the maximum extent feasible:\n(a) without prejudice to Article 49 of the Fourth Convention, endeavour to remove the civilian population, individual civilians and civilian objects under their control from the vicinity of military objectives;\n(b) avoid locating military objectives within or near densely populated areas;\n(c) take the other necessary precautions to protect the civilian population, individual civilians and civilian objects under their control against the dangers resulting from military operations.\nThe rationale behind the article is to abstain from 'defensive tactics that unnecessarily increases civilian risk' by endangering civilians and civilian objects to the detrimental effects of military operations.[216] For this reason, belligerent parties should segregate their military objectives from civilians and civilian objectives; if this is not possible, they should at least protect these people and objects from the effects of cyber operations.[217]\nThe rule is applicable within the territory of the belligerent party, which is responsible for the protection of its nationals or people under its control.[218] However, this territorial application of the rule may pose a significant hurdle in cyberspace. Although it was claimed that 'all civilian cyber infrastructure and activities located in territory under the control of a party to the conflict are subject to this Rule', this approach cannot be applicable in cyberspace since it is almost impossible to control every civilian activity in this domain.[219] This follows a risk that a responsible government may claim\n214.

At this point, the term ‘control’ refutes such a defence by obligating the party to protect civilians and civilian property by segregating civilian computer systems if it has a capacity to control these systems. As a result, this obligation should not be applied by taking territorial concerns into account but rather by considering whether or not these systems are under the de facto control of a party.\nThese precautions are applicable as soon as they are ‘to the maximum extent feasible’. Although the term ‘feasible’ was explained in the first chapter, the Official Commentary further clarifies this term by noting that those measures should ‘not go beyond the point where the life of the population would become difficult or even impossible’. Also, the Tallinn Manual explains the term ‘maximum extent’ in a way that it ‘emphasises the importance of taking the requisite measures’. According to one approach, those measures can be applied depending upon ‘the requirements of national defence’ as stated in the declaration of Austria. From this perspective, parties do not need to expose all of their military facilities, or to put them in a more dangerous position by considering the dictations of the national defence. This is explained in Official Records by the delegation of the Republic of Korea with the following words:\n[T]his provision does not constitute a restriction on a State’s military installations on its own territory. We consider that military facilities necessary for a country’s national defence should be decided on the basis of the actual needs and other considerations of that particular country. An attempt to regulate a country’s requirements and the fulfilment of those requirements in this connexion would not conform to actualities.\nThis is a valid argument since, as described in the first chapter, the principle of precautions obligates parties to take measures when they are ‘practicable or practically possible’. For this reason, every country has to take precautions against the effects of cyber attacks within its own limits.\nWhile the term ‘constant care’ is not explicitly stated in the article, it is still a valid consideration which should be taken into account in order to alleviate risks to civilians and civilian property. At this point, Corn points three reasons why constant care should be taken in both active and passive precautions: First, there is no clear line between ‘attacking’ and ‘defending’ parties in terms of operational art since every armed force needs to conduct both types of operations in the conflict. Second, ‘constant care’ obliges all parties of an armed conflict to conduct their operations by taking civilian harm into account as well as seeking to gain military advantage. This obligation cannot be confined to the attacking party. Third, the exclusion of defending\n220. Jensen (fn 58) 214–15.\n221. Ibid.\n222.

When the nature of cyberspace is taken into account, the obligation becomes more important than conventional warfare since the domain has many more complexities than other areas.\nThese measures are similarly sampled in the ICRC Challenge Report and the Tallinn Manual while discussing feasible precautions against the effects of cyber attacks:\n[S]egregating military from civilian cyber infrastructure; segregating computer systems on which critical civilian infrastructure depends from the Internet; backing up important civilian data; making advance arrangements to ensure the timely repair of important computer systems; digitally recording important cultural or spiritual objects to facilitate reconstruction in the event of their destruction; and using anti-virus measures to protect civilian systems that might suffer damage or destruction during an attack on military cyber infrastructure.\nThis is not an exhaustive list, and every situation may require different precautions to be taken.\n## 4.2 The segregation of civilian networks\nAs it is indicated above, Article 58(a) of the AP-I requires parties to ‘endeavour to remove the civilian population, individual civilians and civilian objects under their control from the vicinity of military objectives’. The obligation should be applied when there is an immediate danger to civilians, and they should be evacuated them from the territory ‘where the risk of attack is greatest’. Even if this measure brings some difficulty to civilians, it aims to protect them from greater suffering, and alternative accommodations should be provided. If these measures are not achieved, this can be deemed forced displacement and a violation of international law.\nWhilst the rule seems applicable when traditional battlefield is taken into account, it still creates some problems. For example, the rule was opposed by Switzerland because of its geographical conditions, where most civilians live in valleys in which important military facilities are located due to the limited number of useful locations in the country, so it becomes very hard to segregate civilians and civilian objects from the proximity of these facilities. The same hardship is applicable for some facilities that can be important for both civilians and military personnel, such as air traffic control centres and power generation plants.\nOn the other hand, the application of the rule in cyberspace brings more difficulty than in traditional domains. Civilian infrastructures are used for almost all cyber operations, and most of them have a dual nature. As an example, how can civilians be removed from cloud technology, which is also used for military purposes? Nevertheless, it is argued in a legal assessment published by the US Department of Defence that ‘[w]here there is a choice … military systems should be kept separate from\n.

For example, parties to the conflict can build a separate cyber infrastructure in which only military communications travel through it, and locate dual-use cyber infrastructures separate from civilians. Although it can be claimed that situations may arise in which civilian and military networks cannot be segregated, state practice has started to follow a different pathway. It is stated by Walker that:\nIn cyberspace, State practice, particularly that of the United States, makes clear that it is feasible to separate purely military objectives from civilian objectives, at least up to a point. The United States military uses multiple, dedicated networks to conduct administrative, logistical and operational activities. The three best-known networks are the Non-Classified Internet Protocol Router Network (NIPRnet, which carries information classified up to and including Sensitive but Unclassified), Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRnet, which carries data classified up to and including the Secret level) and the Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communication System (JWICS carries data classified up to and including Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information).\nAs this example clearly shows, it is imperative to segregate the different types of networks, even if it can be costly. Otherwise, if the object makes an effective contribution and the segregation cannot be established, then the whole cyber infrastructure would be a lawful target.\nGovernmental and civilian data can be stored in the public cloud, despite the fact that this does not literally satisfy the criteria for segregation. However, the Russia-Ukraine War proved its usefulness in terms of reducing cyber dangers. The Ukrainian government moved an important part of the state’s digital infrastructure to the public cloud in preparation for Russian cyber operations against its governmental data center. In this sense, cloud technology turns the disadvantage of cyber infrastructure’s interconnectedness into an advantage. As a more advanced example, the Estonian government established a ‘data embassy’ whose ‘resources are under Estonian state control, secured against cyberattacks or crisis situations with KSI [Keyless Signature Infrastructure] Blockchain technology, and are capable not only providing data backups, but also operating the most critical services’. The particular advantage of such precautions compared with network segregation is that they protect civilian data not only from cyber attacks but also from other types of crises that might occur within states’ borders, such as natural disasters or kinetic attacks.\nIf such precautions impose a significant burden on the belligerent and are not feasible solutions, belligerent parties should search for other ways to shield civilian\n236.

The pertinent precaution could be the establishment of ‘digital safe havens’ through agreements between belligerent parties; while some systems may be difficult to negotiate due to their potential assistance to the adversary’s military effort, other systems critical to civilian life may be easily agreed upon.\n## 4.3 The location of military objectives\nIt is stated in Article 58(b) of the AP-I that belligerent parties should ‘avoid locating military objectives within or near densely populated areas’. From this perspective, parties to the conflict should refrain from locating both movable and immovable objects close to densely populated areas in order to protect civilians under their control. Nevertheless, the rule should not be limited to densely populated areas but also include ‘hospitals, cultural property, places of worship, prisoner of war camps, and other facilities which are entitled to specific protection’ by refraining from locating cyber military objectives in or around them.\nWhile the applicability of the rule is understood in a physical sense, and social media or other similar civilian websites ‘cannot be equated with densely populated areas’, the rule obliges parties to take measures by considering cyber infrastructures which are physically located in the territory of a party. Therefore, for instance, army cyber commands should not be located in places where civilians or special protected objects can be put in danger. However, there is a significant hurdle to locating defence ministries in a place which is not close to densely populated areas. On the other hand, it is still possible for parties to exclude these kinds of facilities, which are military in nature but almost impossible to locate in isolated places, from the ambit of the attack through negotiation. Even if they cannot be attacked, it is possible for a party to conduct disruptive cyber operations against cyber infrastructures in these facilities. At this point, cyber operations give a unique opportunity to parties not to harm civilians but to still have an impact on the military capacity of their enemies.\n## 4.4 Other passive measures\nAs it is stated above, belligerent parties should ‘take the other necessary precautions to protect the civilian population, individual civilians and civilian objects under their control against the dangers resulting from military operations’ according to Article 58(c) of the AP-I. While there is no limit on the scope of the rule, the Official Commentary states that this rule should be applied to civilians by providing them with protective shelters, as well as to specially protected objects by providing trained personnel to limit damage to them. However, conflicting parties should take all feasible precautions by taking the gap-filling function of Article 58(c) into account.\n. Tallinn Manual Rule 121 Cmt. para 10.\n.

However, there are some measures which are applicable to cyberspace by analogy. For example, civilians might be supported by providing them with software products such as anti-virus programs that limit the damage from cyber attacks, detecting civilian cyber systems in order to warn people in case of intrusion attempts, providing them technical assistance when their computer systems are harmed, providing a back-up system to store civilian data, blocking particular IP addresses which pose risks to civilian systems, and keeping ready a system that makes it possible to disconnect an entire country from the Internet when all measures are exhausted.\nWhile the title of Article 58 includes ‘attacks’, paragraph (c) clearly states that some precautions should be applied to operations. Although Jensen admits the ambiguity of this situation, he argues that countries which are not parties to the AP-I have responsibility arising from this provision for those acts that reach ‘attack’ threshold. In the Tallinn Manual, even though the majority of experts stated that the rule is applicable only to cyber attacks because of the title of the article and the non-existence of customary law, the minority focused on the wording of paragraph (c) by accepting cyber operations within the ambit of this rule. Therefore, the minority view kept the threshold lower, determined disruptive operations to be covered by this rule, and obligated parties to take precautions against the effects of these operations. However, both parties have a common understanding on the non-application of the rule to ‘mere inconvenience or irritation’.\nThere is no clear-cut answer on which precautions should be taken within the ambit of Article 58(c), since the provision serves as a gap-filler in the article. Despite the fact that it did not receive much attention in the past because the suitability of other provisions for kinetic activities made them more visible than paragraph (c), their relative unsuitability for cyber operations rendered this clause more important. At this point, the implementation of the norm in cyberspace has already begun to be shaped by the practices of both state and non-state actors, and this trend seems to be continuing and getting better. For example, the US government has begun to warn private entities when they are subjected to transborder cyber attacks and has provided them with cyber tools and training to combat those attacks. Furthermore, the Security Service of Ukraine informs civilians about cyber threats and what measures to take in order to avoid them. As a recent innovative example, the ICRC has been conducting research on creating a ‘digital emblem’ for the past two years in order to enable the identification of objects, systems, or networks that cannot be subject to cyber attacks. Lastly, even though these are individual precautionary measures, the Russia-Ukraine War has also demonstrated how state and non-state entities can collaborate to\n251.

The Microsoft Report highlights two examples of cyber security measures against Russian cyber activities:\nThe first has been the use of technology acquired from RiskIQ that identifies and maps organizational attack surfaces, including devices that are unpatched against known vulnerabilities and therefore are the most susceptible to attack. This information has been shared with the Ukrainian government free of charge to enable it to accelerate the strengthening of cyber-defenses. Ukrainian network defenders worked tirelessly with the constant support of the CERT UA within the government to use this information to protect computers across the country.\nThe second measure has been a wartime innovation pursued with the collaboration and support of the Ukrainian government. MSTIC recognized that Russian malware could be mitigated meaningfully by turning on a feature in Microsoft Defender called controlled folder access. This typically would require that IT administrators access devices across their organization, work made more difficult and potentially even dangerous in wartime conditions. The Ukrainian government therefore authorized Microsoft through special legal measures to act proactively and remotely to turn on this feature across devices throughout the government and across the country.\nEvery effort having a purpose to minimize collateral damage is desired in cyberspace; the principle of precaution essentially relies on the processes but not the results.\n# 5 CONCLUSION\nNew technologies have changed the nature of armed conflict significantly, and this process increasingly continues. As one kind of these technologies, cyber operations have introduced significant challenges to the LOAC, but the most unique one is their capability to have a wide range of effects because of the interconnectedness of cyberspace. This article has endeavoured to determine the application of the principle of precautions to cyber operations by tilting the principle towards humanity by considering the natures of both the principle and cyberspace.\nFrom the standpoint of the principle of precautions, the Russia-Ukraine War exemplified an important phenomenon: public-private cooperation against adversarial cyber operations. Unlike traditional domains, private entities have a partial but critical level of control over cyberspace, and as a result of this distinctive feature of the current conflicts, the Ukrainian government collaborated with a technology giant, Microsoft. This collaboration is emphasized in the Microsoft Report by stating that:\n[U]nlike the traditional threats of the past, cyber defenses rely on a unique level of public and private collaboration. The evolving threat landscape requires a whole-of-society approach. The private sector, particularly technology companies, are on the front lines of cyber and information attacks. Likewise, civil society organizations are key conveners that play a crucial role in engagement, sometimes are involved in cyber data analysis, and are often targets of these campaigns themselves.\nBringing non-public entities into the equation in cyberspace, thereby putting more civilians in the balance, would enhance the ‘civilianization’ of armed conflicts, and this would inherently lean the principle of precaution on the side of humanity.\n.

International Conferences (The Hague), Hague Convention (IV) Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land and Its Annex: Regulations Concerning the Laws and Customs of War on Land, 18 October 1907.\n³⁸. See League of Nations Res ‘Protection of Civilian Populations Against Bombing from the Air in Case of War’ (30 September 1938). Later, more detailed rules were articulated in Articles 8, 9 and 11 of the Draft Rules for the Limitation of the Dangers incurred by the Civilian Population in Time of War (1956). Despite the fact that states did not adopt these rules, they had an impact on the rules codified in Additional Protocols. See S Watts, ‘Law-of-War Precautions: A Cautionary Note’ in RTP Alcala and E Talbot Jensen (eds), The Impact of Emerging Technologies on the Law of Armed Conflict (Oxford University Press, 2019) 116.\n© 2023 The Author Journal compilation © 2023 Edward Elgar Publishing Ltd Downloaded from https://www.elgaronline.com/ at 07/16/2025 08:36:46PM via University College London (UCL) The Military Law and the Law of War Review, Vol. 61 No. 1 in which it is stated that both attacking and defending parties shall take precautions to spare civilians and civilian objects in an armed conflict. At this point, for *jus in bello* cyberspace operations, the principle of precautions provides a twofold protection: the first comprises taking constant care while conducting cyber attacks ('precautions in attack'), and the second comprises taking feasible precautions in order to protect civilians from the effects of cyber attacks ('precautions against the effects of attacks') during armed conflicts. These precautions can also be named 'active' and 'passive' precautions ruled under Articles 57 and 58 of the AP-I.\nThe rules stated in Articles 57 and 58 are applied in times of armed conflicts, though the definition of 'armed conflict' is not provided in the Protocol. In this article, the definition given in the Tadic Decision, in which it was described as 'a resort to armed force between States or protracted armed violence between governmental authorities and organized armed groups or between such groups within a State',[39] is adopted. From this definition, it can be stated that there are two types of armed conflicts; 'between States' (international armed conflicts), and 'between governmental authorities and organized armed groups or between such groups' (non-international armed conflicts). In identifying the nature of the conflict, the status of the actors is the decisive factor.[40] The importance of this distinction is that while the AP-I, which is applicable to international armed conflicts, clearly states the obligation to take precautions, there is no clear provision which regulates the principle of precautions in Additional Protocol-II,[41] which is applicable to non-international armed conflicts. However, it does not prevent the application of the principle to the latter type of conflicts since it is stated in Article 13(1) of the AP-II that '[t]he civilian population and individual civilians shall enjoy general protection against the dangers arising from military operations'. Therefore, it is argued in the work of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) on Customary Rules that, by approving the customary nature of the principle for both international and non-international armed conflict, it is hard to abide by such a rule without taking any precaution.[42] Moreover, it is stated in the Tadic Decision that 'all necessary precautions should be taken to avoid injury, loss or damage to civilian populations' in all kinds of armed conflicts by referring to a resolution adopted by the United Nations General Assembly.[43] Finally, two recent treaties that are applicable to non-international armed conflicts explicitly regulate the principle of precautions.[44] © 2023 The Author Journal compilation © 2023 Edward Elgar Publishing Ltd Downloaded from https://www.elgaronline.com/ at 07/16/2025 08:36:46PM via University College London (UCL) The application of the principle of precautions to cyber operations 11 It is crucial to make the distinction between military operations and attacks since some precautions are applicable to all military operations, as stated in Article 57 (1) and (4), though others can only be applied to attacks.⁴⁵ However, when these provisions are read together with Article 49, it might cause confusion in the first instance because while Article 49(3) clearly restricts the application of Section IV rules of the AP-I to operations conducted in the air or sea which have impacts on ‘civilians or civilian objects on land’, Article 57(4) seems to obligate parties to respect the principle of precautions in the conduct of these operations without any limitation. To solve this problem, one should deem Article 57(4) as ‘merely a restatement of one of the existing rules’.⁴⁶ As Article 49(3) makes clear, the article does not affect those rules that are customary in nature and applicable to all types of military operations. Therefore, Article 57(4) does not contradict but rather ‘complement’ it.⁴⁷ Since the principle of precautions applies to both operations and attacks, both of these terms should be clarified. At this point, military operations are ‘any movements, manoeuvres and other activities whatsoever carried out by the armed forces with a view to combat’.⁴⁸ Therefore, all parties to the conflict should exercise constant care while conducting their military operations. For instance, if a tank driver harms civilian property while maneuvering the vehicle, he/she will be responsible due to the breach of the principle of precautions.⁴⁹ From this perspective, if a perpetrator destroys a civilian network while conducting cyber exploitation against either a civilian or military cyber system, he/she will bear responsibility. However, military attacks require a certain threshold since they are violent acts causing death, injury, damage, or destruction – or at least intending to do so.⁵⁰ As a result, all military attacks are kinds of military operations but vice versa would not be true. Therefore, while cyber operation can be defined as ‘the employment of cyber capabilities to achieve objectives in or through cyberspace’,⁵¹ cyber attack is ‘a cyber operation, whether offensive or defensive, that is reasonably expected to cause injury or death to persons or damage or destruction to objects’.⁵² In light of this, cyber attack is a special kind of cyber operation that results in violent effects. However, cyber attacks require a broader understanding because damage to objects may occur as a secondary effect of cyber operations. Therefore, the present author agrees with the approach of the majority of the International Group of Experts (the Experts), who prepared the Tallinn Manual, that cyber operations that result in the replacement of a component by having an impact on the functionality of an object fall within the ambit of attack because, while these kinds of operations do not damage an object in the first instance, their effects in later phases reach the threshold of attack by causing physical harm.⁵³ ⁴⁵.

At this point, the applicability of international law to cyber operations is recognized by states and international organizations.⁵⁵ Also, there is a certain difference between a cyber operation and an attack, and not all precautionary measures are applicable to all kinds of cyber operations.\n## 2.2 Constant care According to Article 57(1) of the AP-I, the attacking party shall always take ‘constant care’ to spare civilians and civilian objects while conducting military operations. The term ‘constant care’ is clarified in the HPCR Manual Commentary by stating that ‘there are no exceptions from the duty to seek to spare the civilian population, civilians and civilian objects’.⁵⁶ Therefore, constant care obliges all levels of the armed forces who are responsible for planning, ordering or executing a cyber operation to always consider the results of it and try to minimize its effects on civilians.⁵⁷ The ‘constant care’ obligation is necessary for cyber operations. Those who are involved in the operation should always be aware of the foreseeable effects of operations on the civilian population and property and try to minimize these effects as much as possible. For this reason, it is not enough to demonstrate due care in the planning stage; this obligation extends to all stages of the operation in which civilians might be affected. In other words, these people should have ‘situational awareness at all times’.⁵⁸ The concept of situational awareness is explained in the Allied Joint Doctrine for Cyberspace Operations by describing it as ‘a combination of a near real-time updated RCP [Recognised Cyberspace Picture], analysis and information management’.⁵⁹ Although the obligation is constrained by the execution stage of an operation as described in the article, the effects of the attack can continue.

If the effects of the operation on civilians are not excessive compared to the anticipated military advantage, then the attacking party may continue to carry out cyber operations. However, the calculation may be difficult because of the time-sensitivity. Planned operations give more chance to the attacking party to take better precautions, though time-sensitive ones generally do not permit sufficient time to implement more suitable precautions.⁶³ Although the impact of such a condition on precautions is not deniable, it does not give permission to the attacker to deviate from the principle because the constant care obligation necessitates parties to take feasible precautions in all circumstances.⁶⁴ The second significant hurdle might be the secretive nature of cyberspace since ambiguity is at the centre of cyber warfare.⁶⁵ Even though attribution may be difficult in that domain and the perpetrator of cyber acts that violate the LOAC cannot be easily found, parties to the conflict should obey the rules of the LOAC by considering warrior ethics. From this perspective, cyber warriors should always seek ways to mitigate risks towards civilians in good faith since ‘[r]espect for LOAC obligations is the essential touchstone for that ethical foundation’.⁶⁶ This ethical foundation serves for better protection of civilians, which is an inherent objective of the LOAC.⁶⁷ Last but not least, the ‘constant care’ obligation should not be accepted as limited to this article. It involves all phases of operations and attacks, which are carried out by both attacking and defending parties. For this reason, it has a guidance function while examining all provisions of Articles 57 and 58.\n## 2.3 Feasibility Article 57 obliges parties to take ‘feasible’ precautions in order to minimize the effects of an attack on civilians and civilian objects. In the Official Commentary of Article 57, it is stated that those precautions are ‘everything that was practicable or practically possible, taking into account all the circumstances at the time of the attack, including ⁶⁰.

At this point, every situation has its unique features, and those responsible for an attack should adapt various precautions by considering the characteristics of the situation. For example, an attacker party should map the target network through exploitation operations if it is connected to other civilian networks.71 In such situations, LOAC not only permits cyber espionage but also obligates a belligerent party to conduct these operations. However, such operations require a certain level of technical expertise, and in the absence of that, such a network should not be exploited.72 Despite such expertise, some mistakes may occur in the 'fog of war'.73 At this point, a commander who took 'all due measures' is not responsible for this harm.74 Those measures can be identified by different factors such as available cyber means, time sensitivity, the cyber defence system of the enemy, the characteristics of the target, intelligence assets, the expertise of the attacking team, the loyalty of the enemy of to the LOAC, and available assets and vulnerabilities of the enemy.75 However, even if feasible precautions are taken, unintended results may occur for various reasons, such as failure of the intelligence system, dysfunction of the technology, or unexpected changes in tactical conditions.76 For instance, a commander might prepare a map of a cyber network before conducting an attack, but the virus unintentionally spreads among the civilian infrastructure, which has a connection with the military network.77 At this point, while deciding on whether the principle of precautions is respected or not, one should not focus on outcomes, but compliance should be measured by the process in which an © 2023 The Author Journal compilation © 2023 Edward Elgar Publishing Ltd Downloaded from https://www.elgaronline.com/ at 07/16/2025 08:36:46PM via University College London (UCL)</https:> The application of the principle of precautions to cyber operations 15 attacking party makes diligent efforts.⁷⁸ For instance, if an attacker has advanced cyber capabilities that make it possible to disrupt an electrical grid without harming civilians but prefers to carry out an attack by conventional means – which results in civilian damage – it cannot claim that its adversary does not use the same level of technology to refrain from harming civilians.⁷⁹ Thus, it is true that each party has a responsibility ‘within its means or methods or its capability’ as stated by the Indian delegate.⁸⁰ Even if the commander has advanced cyber weapons, he/she may try to spare them for use during later stages of the conflict by taking military considerations into account. Therefore, it is permitted for the military commander in the Naval Manual of Ecuador to use alternative methods ‘in light of all the facts known or reasonably available to him, including the need to conserve resources and complete the mission successfully’.⁸¹ However, if it is understood that using less advanced weapons will result in excessive collateral damage, then they should either use advanced ones or cancel the attack.⁸² On the other hand, the determination of feasibility on a contextual basis should not be used to assuage the burden from the shoulders of the attacker. For example, the use of white phosphorus shells near al-Wafa hospital, where patients have serious injuries and need long-term care, by the Israeli armed forces was deemed a violation of Articles 57(2)(b) and (c) of the AP-I.⁸³ It was stated that those who were responsible for the attack should be aware of ‘all the facts and circumstances’.⁸⁴ For this reason, while conducting a cyber operation against a system in which some medical records may be located, the attacking party should take special care. The same is valid for facilities such as dams, where dangerous forces are located.⁸⁵ ## 2.4 Responsibility The wording of Article 57 restricts its applicability to ‘those who plan or decide upon an attack’. Because of this wording, some states have expressed reservations about Article 57, claiming that it only applies to ‘commanding officers at the battalion or group level and those of higher ranks’.⁸⁶ Nonetheless, every soldier who breaches obligations imposed by the LOAC bears individual criminal responsibility for his/her acts when such crimes are committed with ‘intent and knowledge’.⁸⁷ At this point, it does ⁷⁸.

The reason is that volumetric attacks can end up using all available channel capacity, which would affect the networks on the path to the target. This has happened in the past, with powerful DDoS attacks launched against specific targets and affecting entire internet infrastructure providers.⁹⁵ However, the unpredictability of effects does not relieve the responsibility of all levels of command while conducting operations. According to Watkin, operational factors cannot be put forward in order not to take feasible precautions in today’s trend, which pursues to compromise ‘human rights-like accountability frameworks with operational decision making during armed conflict’.⁹⁶ Accordingly, all members of the armed forces who are part of operations in cyberspace should do everything feasible within their limits.\nWhile assessing the individual responsibility of officers, they should be judged by how much they know about a certain subject. The well-known example is the Rendulic Decision, in which the Nuremberg Tribunal held that ‘the “scorched earth” policy in ⁸⁸ Sandoz, Swinarski and Zimmermann (eds) (fn 3) 2197; APV Rogers, ‘General Report-Conduct of Combat and Risks Run by the Civilian Population’ (1982) 21 Mil.

For this reason, later evidence which showed that ‘the danger did not actually exist’ cannot be used to convict the commander since he ‘acted within the limits of honest judgment on the basis of the conditions prevailing at the time’. This is crucial considering the interconnectivity of cyberspace since cyber attacks might affect civilian networks unexpectedly despite a commander’s employment of the advanced technology to conduct constant surveillance over a network. At this point, the responsibility arising out of a cyber attack would not go beyond what the defendant knew at the time of the attack.\nOn the other hand, one needs to distinguish misinformation from misconception. Misconception of the nature of the target might occur because of cognitive bias, which misdirects attackers by analyzing information ‘in a manner that supports their pre-existing beliefs or mental frameworks’. States should employ a variety of techniques such as ‘training and education, red teaming procedures, specific positive identification (PID) policies for targeting, use of structured analytic techniques, and other analytic tradecraft practices’ in order for this not to result in civilian damage. Despite the fact that states are keen to protect soldiers in such situations, inflicting civilian harm due to biased decisions does not very well fit with the notion of ‘honest judgement’.\nLastly, those who undertake cyber operations may be fully aware of the results of their actions owing to their technical expertise since cyberspace requires unique understanding compared to traditional domains. If a higher commander issues an order to launch a cyber operation without being aware of the outcomes in good faith, inferior commanders will be responsible for such intentional conduct. However, if a commander is aware that he lacks sufficient information about a target, he should either change the concept of the attack or refrain from issuing such an order. Should an operation continue to be carried out while being aware of this insufficiency, responsibility arises.",
    "# 3 PRECAUTIONS IN ATTACK ## 3.1 Target verification It is stated in Article 57(2) of the AP-I that: (a) those who plan or decide upon an attack shall: (i) do everything feasible to verify that the objectives to be attacked are neither civilians nor civilian objects and are not subject to special protection but are military objectives within the © 2023 The Author Journal compilation © 2023 Edward Elgar Publishing Ltd Downloaded from https://www.elgaronline.com/ at 07/16/2025 08:36:46PM via University College London (UCL) The Military Law and the Law of War Review, Vol. 61 No. 1 meaning of paragraph 2 of Article 52 and that it is not prohibited by the provisions of this Protocol to attack them.": "The rationale behind this provision is to prevent carrying out attacks against objectives that are not military in nature because of misinformation or against military objectives in order to get a small military advantage by significantly harming civilians and objects.^[105]^ The binding definition of military objectives is codified in Article 52(2) of the AP-I, which states that: [M]ilitary objectives are limited to those objects which by their nature, location, purpose or use make an effective contribution to military action and whose total or partial destruction, capture or neutralization, in the circumstances ruling at the time, offers a definite military advantage.\nFrom this definition, there must be two cumulative elements ('two-pronged test')^[106]^ in order to deem an object as military, which are effective contribution and military advantage. For this reason, an object that is military in nature should not be subject to attack if it does not effectively contribute to the military capacity of an enemy.^[107]^ While only Article 52(2) of the AP-I has found its place in the provision, lawful targets also include people who can be made the object of direct cyber attacks. According to the LOAC, various categories of people can be held as lawful targets. The first one consists of combatants who are members of the armed forces and have a right to directly participate in hostilities.^[108]^ Even though they are lawful targets, they have a right to be treated as prisoners of war when they are captured by the enemy.^[109]^ The second category includes direct participants in hostilities. Although they are civilian in nature, they will be accepted as lawful targets if they meet three cumulative criteria which are: threshold of harm, direct causation and belligerent nexus.^[110]^ Those people are lawful targets 'for such time as they take a direct part in hostilities',^[111]^ and if they are captured, they cannot benefit from prisoner of war status.\nThe third category, though there is a discussion on it, consists of members of an organized armed group that is a belligerent party in an armed conflict. They are 'individuals whose continuous function involves the preparation, execution, or command of acts or operations amounting to direct participation in hostilities'.^[112]^ © 2023 The Author Journal compilation © 2023 Edward Elgar Publishing Ltd Downloaded from https://www.elgaronline.com/ at 07/16/2025 08:36:46PM via University College London (UCL) The application of the principle of precautions to cyber operations 19 At first glance, the second and third categories may seem identical, but the difference is that while civilians who fall into the former categories ‘directly participate in hostilities on a merely spontaneous, sporadic, or unorganized basis’, the latter category of people has a continuous combat function, which ‘requires lasting integration into an organised armed group acting as the armed forces of a non-state party to an armed conflict’.¹¹³ The result of this distinction is that those who directly participate in hostilities lose their protected status only for a limited period of time, but the last category of individuals loses it ‘as long as they remain members’, and this membership renders them lawful targets ‘even before he or she first carries out a hostile act’.¹¹⁴ After it was stated in the Official Commentary that the military commander does not need to have personal knowledge, it was argued that even if there is a ‘slight doubt’, additional information shall be obtained.¹¹⁵ By supporting it, Rogers points out that ‘[i]n the event of doubt about the nature of the target, an attack should not be carried out, with a possible exception where failure to prosecute the attack would put attacking forces in immediate danger’.¹¹⁶ However, this approach is challenged by some states, which claim that the determination should be ‘substantial doubt’¹¹⁷ to suspend an attack and require supplementary information. In the same vein, various authors claimed that conducting military operations without having a doubt on the nature of a target is not a reasonable expectation in the fog of war.¹¹⁸ From this perspective, there is always some doubt as an inherent characteristic of combat. On the other hand, the present author thinks that the Official Commentary should be interpreted as the aim of a commander. By stating the ‘slight doubt’ requirement, the commentary obligates them to take better precautions even if it is possible to erase this doubt. This is approved by military practice, in which attacks are cancelled when combatants are not ‘certain’¹¹⁹ or ‘100 percent sure of their aiming point’.¹²⁰ According to Parks, the US achieved this level of accuracy during the Linebacker II campaign by constantly confirming the nature of targets, implementing rules set by the Strategic Air Command, and issuing bomb damage assessments after each attack.¹²¹ Despite the fact that such high-level precautions sometimes pose substantial risks to the combatants’ lives, he acknowledges that they are important not only in terms of legality but also for achieving military and political objectives.¹²² By considering such positive outcomes, a commander should be sure enough that he/she made reasonable efforts to verify the nature of the target in cyberspace.¹²³ © 2023 The Author Journal compilation © 2023 Edward Elgar Publishing Ltd Downloaded from https://www.elgaronline.com/ at 07/16/2025 08:36:46PM via University College London (UCL)</https:> The Military Law and the Law of War Review, Vol. 61 No. 1 Lastly, the dual nature of cyber systems might cause an attacker to identify only one particular part of the target as military, and the determination of other parts may remain unclear. At this point, cyber attack should be limited to that component, which is military in nature.¹²⁴ If it is not possible, then the attack should be cancelled. However, this should not be equated with being ‘perfectly familiar with the network’¹²⁵ since such an interpretation is not appropriate with the term ‘feasible’.\n## 3.2 Choice of cyber means and methods After the nature of the target is verified, the next step will be to compose an operational plan that will have a minimum effect on civilians. At this point, it is stated in Article 57 (2)(a)(ii) of the AP-I that members of the armed forces should ‘take all feasible precautions in the choice of means and methods of attack with a view to avoiding, and in any event to minimising, incidental loss or civilian life, injury to civilians and damage to civilian objects’. This means that even if an attack is proportionate, parties to the conflict should be careful in their choice of means and methods in order to minimize the effects of attacks as much as possible while still aiming to obtain maximum military advantage. At this point, an attacking party should produce a plan that promises to give the most efficient operational and legal results.¹²⁶ It is important to define ‘cyber means’ and ‘methods’. Cyber means are defined as ‘cyber weapons and their associated cyber systems’¹²⁷ in the Tallinn Manual. At this point, cyber weapons are kinds of cyber means, but the latter includes a broader category. Cyber methods, on the other hand, are defined as ‘the cyber tactics, techniques, and procedures by which hostilities are conducted’.¹²⁸ Whilst cyber means are concerned with which tools should be employed to carry out cyber operations, cyber methods are concerned with how these operations should be carried out.¹²⁹ Based on this viewpoint, while botnets are a type of cyber means, the DDoS attack that is conducted by botnets can be considered a type of cyber method.¹³⁰ There is no weapon or method that is specifically prohibited in the provision. It only obliges parties to take feasible precautions by choosing appropriate means and methods; thereby, a commander will not be responsible for causing civilian harm. However, the rule does not require parties to choose means and methods that may decrease their expected military advantage.¹³¹ Even if alternative means and methods are not used because of this concern, a planned cyber attack must abide by other principles such as distinction and proportionality.¹³² On the other hand, if choosing different means and methods may change the degree of damage by producing ‘equivalent effects’ upon the target, then alternative means or methods shall be selected.¹³³ A facility where armed forces of a belligerent party conduct cyber attacks against the enemy, ¹²⁴.

However, this may result in civilian deaths who live in the vicinity of the facility. At this point, if an attacking party has available means to conduct a cyber attack, it shall use them against the system or computers in the facility to stop belligerent attacks. Additionally, military personnel’s expertise with those new technologies is crucial. The concern was raised in the Eritrea-Ethiopia Claims Commission. Even though Eritrea refused Ethiopia’s allegations that some of its aircraft intentionally attacked civilians, the inexperience of Eritrean pilots in using ‘computerized aiming systems’, which led to the failure to target military objectives, was held as a violation of Article 57 of the AP-I.¹³⁴ Lastly, a ‘target list’ can be prepared and constantly reviewed by belligerent parties in order to determine which type of weapon should be used to decrease civilian harm by considering the characteristics of the target.¹³⁵ For example, the bombardment of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) compound by the Israeli Armed Forces, which resulted in extensive damage and endangered the lives of many civilians, was accepted as reckless conduct and a violation of Article 57(2)(a)(ii) of the AP-I since it was executed while being aware of its importance for civilians.¹³⁶ However, in the Vietnam War, the US employed fragmentation bombs that had limited effects on the target to execute attacks against anti-aircraft batteries; since these batteries were located inside dikes, the army tried to refrain from damaging them.¹³⁷ The accuracy and range of weapons also have a particular importance in the execution of attacks.¹³⁸ If a target can be destroyed by accurate weapons, then it does not make sense to use dumb bombs or other means whose effects may not be calculated properly or limited. In this sense, the US practice in the Linebacker II campaign is important. During the campaign, the B-52s that have wide-range effects were employed because of weather conditions and the limited number of the more precise weapons.¹³⁹ But to keep the collateral damage to a minimum, the B-52s were used against targets that were either sufficiently large or in military-industrial complexes.¹⁴⁰ Other objectives requiring pinpoint strikes, such as bridges and railroad yards, were hit by more precise weapons when weather conditions permitted, which was limited to 12 hours during the 12-day campaign.¹⁴¹ As such practice in a highly interconnected battle arena demonstrates, cyber means and weapons should be used against adversaries while always considering their accuracy and range. When it would not be possible to precisely damage a cyber target that is interconnected with a civilian network, they should be used against military cyber networks, or at least those networks whose destruction does not have a significant impact on civilians. In this manner, a cyber mean can be designed to affect only a specific type of system, as it was in the Stuxnet incident, in which malware only affected the SCADA systems.\n¹³⁴.

That attack used ‘wormable’ destructive malware that could jump from one computer domain to another and hence cross borders into other countries. Russia has been careful in 2022 to confine destructive ‘wiper software’ to specific network domains inside Ukraine itself. But the recent and ongoing destructive attacks themselves have been sophisticated and more widespread than many reports recognize. And the Russian army is continuing to adapt these destructive attacks to changing war needs, including by coupling cyberattacks with the use of conventional weapons.¹⁴⁵ This passage raises two concerns. First, which types of cyber means are used? Second, excluding other considerations such as political or military ones, why did the Russians allegedly employ such means in an armed conflict while adhering to the LOAC?\nAs an answer to the first question, the Microsoft Report lists cyber means that were used or are in use in the Russia-Ukraine War:\nAccording to the report, numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4 are ‘all malware families that overwrite data and render machines unbootable’; number 6 is a ‘.NET capability being used for data deletion’; number 7 is a ‘file encryptor sometimes used together with FoxBlade’; and number 8 ‘specifically targets operational technology to achieve physical effects in industrial production and processes’.¹⁴⁶ Even though the Microsoft Report does not give detail about number 5, another report states that it deletes data from physical and logical drives, though its impact is limited.¹⁴⁷ Except for number 8, the effects\n¹⁴².

This brings an important issue to the surface. Even though the debate exists, operations causing such damage do not constitute attacks in terms of *lex lata*. Therefore, it would not be possible to apply Article 57 (2)(a)(ii) to those malwares since the rule encompasses means of warfare that are ‘used, designed, or intended to be used to conduct a cyber attack’.¹⁴⁸ Then the question would be why Russia needs to employ such discriminatory cyber means.\nFrom the present author’s perspective, the war demonstrated that the key benefit of using cyber means in warfare is their adaptability, instead of previous assumptions that cyber operations provide a belligerent party an advantage owing to their low cost or non-attributability. As stated in the report, Russia adapted such means to ‘changing war needs’.¹⁴⁹ This adaptation should be seen from two perspectives: cyber and kinetic. The former is important from a technical standpoint, and the latter is important from a legal standpoint, but both of them need to be examined because of their importance from a military standpoint.\nEven though it does not have a direct relationship with the legality of cyber means in terms of Article 57(2)(a)(ii), the technical standing point is important to understand why parties adopt cyber means in armed conflicts. Every new step in technology has the potential to threaten the kinetic weapon supremacy of an adversary. For example, the invention of a new type of surface-to-air missile system can erase the advantage of the adversary’s aircraft, and the attacking party needs to make a huge investment to improve its aircraft and produce new ones to establish a new squadron. On the other hand, the adaptability of cyber means makes it possible for past used malware to escape from such quick elimination. By adding some extra codes, a cyber weapon can be adjusted based on a new type of cyber security measure, and such modification can turn it into a new type of weapon. As stated by the ICRC, ‘it is possible for offensive cyber capabilities to be reverse-engineered or repurposed so that they can be reused. This is also the case for some traditional weapon systems, but the technical characteristics of cyberspace raise these concerns in a unique manner’.¹⁵⁰ This uniqueness has been and continues to be demonstrated in the Russia-Ukraine War. Numerous reports claim that Russia used or is using malware by modifying previously used ones. In other words, cyber security updates also bring updates to those malwares, and they are adapted to changing needs in the cyber environment. For example, AcidRain, a wiper malware used to disrupt the VIASAT satellite, shares some characteristics with VPNFilter, a kind of malware used by Russia-backed cyber-organized groups in 2018.¹⁵¹ Also, such modifications do not have to take a long time. Shortly after the intrusion of WhisperGate into Ukrainian systems and its detection by cyber security companies, Russia altered it and developed a new type of malware, Hermeticwiper, that ‘has some similarities to the earlier WhisperGate’.¹⁵² This shows that detecting malware and taking defensive measures against it do not make such malware useless, but certain parts of the codes can still be used by belligerents to improve their cyber capabilities owing to their adaptability.\n¹⁴⁸.

Figure 1 above, depicted by Microsoft, shows how critical infrastructures are subject to cyber operations as the Russian tanks roll toward cities. Additionally, the fact that certain facilities, which are being physically attacked, were subject to cyber operations, demonstrates that the coordination is not general but rather as specific as possible. As a result, every operation that is part of an attack has to be evaluated within the meaning of the LOAC, and this necessitates evaluating the cyber means stated above to be employed by respecting relevant rules, including the principle of precautions.\nWhile choosing cyber methods, the first relevant factor is the timing of the attack to minimize collateral damage.[154] During World War II, Allied Forces conducted attacks on military factories at times when there were a minimum number of civilian workers present.[155] In that vein, for example, while carrying out cyber attacks against dual-use objects, the belligerent party may execute them at night or early in the morning when the targets are not intensively used by civilians.\n© 2023 The Author Journal compilation © 2023 Edward Elgar Publishing Ltd Downloaded from https://www.elgaronline.com/ at 07/16/2025 08:36:46PM via University College London (UCL) The application of the principle of precautions to cyber operations 25 The second relevant criterion is the location of the target. If a target is located in a place that is mostly used by civilians and there is a significant level of risk of harm occurring, the attacker shall use the most accurate weapons available or must refrain from conducting such an attack.¹⁵⁶ At this point, there is a discussion on whether the Internet can be held as a lawful target because, while it might make an effective contribution to the military capacity of the enemy, it is mostly used by civilians. Even though it is argued that if an attacking party believes that it can get enough military advantage, a cyber attack against the Internet is permissible,¹⁵⁷ another opinion accepts the Internet as a civilian object and prohibits such an attack.¹⁵⁸ According to the latter opinion, even if it is intended to carry out a cyber attack against the Internet, it should be limited to ‘individual networks, servers, routers, links, and other computer facilities that are used for military purposes and which are likely to be connected to the Internet’.¹⁵⁹ By accepting the latter interpretation, the present author considers that if it is possible to considerably limit the effects of the attack, especially by considering the dual nature of cyberspace, then an attack may be conducted. If not, it will be in breach of the rule.\nWhilst some authors argue that the choice of means and methods only come onto the scene when there is a similar advantage,¹⁶⁰ the present author thinks that the criteria should not be applied strictly. As stated by Borghard and Lonergan while discussing coercion in cyberspace, the attacking party tries to apply less harmful ways, such as disruptive operations rather than destructive ones, in order to better negotiate at later stages since the system may be restored more easily when the former type of means are used.¹⁶¹ At this point, the belligerent party should choose the type of means or methods to achieve the intended outcomes by considering the post-conflict situation.¹⁶² There is no doubt that a large number of civilian deaths will prolong the conflict, even if the attacks are perfectly legal. The bombing of Radio-Television of Serbia by NATO, which sparked so many debates about the legality of the campaign, may be an example of the adverse impact of such conduct. To Kolb, even if the station can be assumed as a military objective, it was repaired in three hours, and 16 civilians were killed because of the attack.¹⁶³ By taking lessons from this example, it can be stated that belligerent parties should always consider alternatives, even if a designed cyber attack seems lawful. In such a case, disrupting broadcasting by cyber operation might produce better consequences, even though it seems that destruction promises more advantage. In these kinds of situations, perpetrators should always keep the humanitarian aims of the LOAC in mind.\n¹⁵⁶.

However, both of these provisions have similar meanings by prohibiting attacks conducted against a legitimate target if it seems that ‘excessive’ collateral damage will occur, whether the cyber attack is being planned or has already been planned.¹⁶⁴ At this point, there should be a balance between military advantage and civilian harm.\n## 3.3.1 Military advantage The advantage should be military in nature rather than merely moral, political or financial.¹⁶⁵ For example, conducting cyber attacks against specific sectors of a country, such as the oil industry, which is vital for Arab countries, by considering that such an operation against ‘war-sustaining objects’ will decrease the military effort of an enemy is not appropriate since ‘almost every civilian activity might be construed by the enemy as indirectly sustaining the war effort’ as stated by Dinstein.¹⁶⁶ Also, it is stated in the Official Commentary that this type of advantage can only be gained by the annihilation of an enemy or gaining ground; the transformation of the notion of war, however, changed this paradigm.¹⁶⁷ While the former can be categorized as an overstatement, the latter seems to be an understatement. Hence, as a moderate approach, the HPCR Manual Commentary points out that ‘any consequence of an attack which directly enhances friendly military operations or hinders those of the enemy’¹⁶⁸ should be included within the ambit of military advantage.\nCyber attacks should be assessed as a whole while aiming to obtain military advantage.¹⁶⁹ As stated by Fenrick and approved by declarations of numerous states, proportionality calculations cannot be made on either ‘a bullet-by-bullet basis’ or ‘the basis of attacks on individual military objectives’.¹⁷⁰ Furthermore, when the army launches concerted or coordinated cyber attacks, it may be impossible or impractical for every ¹⁶⁴.

Although it was claimed that people who give an order will bear responsibility rather than those who execute the attack in such a case, if it is apparent that the targeted network is civilian in nature after the attack is initiated, it should be cancelled or a confirmation should be demanded by the perpetrator from higher ranks in light of changing circumstances.¹⁷² Lastly, assessing a cyber attack as a whole should not be interpreted as having a purpose to obtain military advantage by taking the ‘full context of a war strategy’ into account.¹⁷³ Otherwise, all cyber attacks, whether they incur excessive civilian damages or not, can be deemed legal in defiance of the aims of the LOAC.\n## 3.3.2 Collateral damage Collateral damage can be described as an ‘incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians and damage to civilian objects or other protected objects or a combination thereof, caused by an attack on a lawful target’.¹⁷⁴ At this point, collateral damage occurs while conducting cyber attacks against military targets without deliberately targeting civilians and civilian property.\nCollateral damage includes both the direct and indirect effects of a cyber attack. While the former type of effects are those that ‘are the immediate, first order consequence of a military action (weapons employment results, etc.), unaltered by intervening events or mechanisms’;¹⁷⁵ the latter type of effects are ‘the delayed or displaced second-, third-, and higher-order consequences of action, created through intermediate events or mechanisms’.¹⁷⁶ Since cyber operations are carried out at the logical layer of cyberspace, their first-order effects have an impact on data, programs, or software; nevertheless, such effects are not included in the aforementioned definition of collateral damage.¹⁷⁷ Yet, ‘indirect effects may be aimed at the other layers of cyberspace, or at creating other higher-order effects in other domains’, and thereby such effects can raise the level of collateral damage.¹⁷⁸ Therefore, the inclusion of indirect effects in the concept of collateral harm is crucial. However, due to the complexity involved in calculating second- or higher-order effects, such an inclusion also poses a significant challenge in cyberspace. As acknowledged in the Allied Doctrine: Since cyberspace is a global domain, there is a risk of COs [cyberspace operations] having an impact outside the joint operations area. COs can create undesired effects on our own ¹⁷¹. Quéguiner (fn 154) 804.\n¹⁷². Ibid at 804–805.\n¹⁷³.

This risk, as with similar risks in other domains, is factored into the planning.¹⁷⁹ Even though it is not necessary to make certain calculations, effects which are too remote or beyond the scope of reasonable certainty will not cause any responsibility for combatants.¹⁸⁰ Lastly, collateral damage does not contain minor effects such as stress, irritation or inconvenience.¹⁸¹ All cyber attacks might cause stress or inconvenience to some extent, but that does not make them illegal.\n## 3.3.3 Excessive collateral damage Belligerent parties should always consider whether the expected military advantage is proportionate compared to the anticipated collateral damage. At this point, the terms ‘extensive’ and ‘excessive’ should be differentiated. In the Official Commentary, it was argued that conducting attacks against lawful targets should not create ‘extensive destruction of civilian objects’¹⁸² despite the fact that there is no reference to such a limitation in the Additional Protocols. The collateral damage can be justified even if it is at the ‘extensive’ level on the condition that the nominated target is important enough. Although civilian casualties are ‘regrettable and tragic consequences of the war’, those losses do not ‘in themselves establish liability … under international law’ as stated by the Eritrea-Ethiopia Claims Commission.¹⁸³ Excessiveness cannot be determined by approaching it as a mathematical formula, despite the fact that ‘[f]ifty civilians killed for one suspected combatant’ is given as a ‘textbook example of a violation of the proportionality principle’ by some authors.¹⁸⁴ However, as stated in the NATO Bombing Report: It is much easier to formulate the principle of proportionality in general terms than it is to apply it to a particular set of circumstances because the comparison is often between unlike quantities and values. One cannot easily assess the value of innocent human lives as opposed to capturing a particular military objective.¹⁸⁵ Hence, excessiveness should be evaluated depending upon the comparison between two values, namely, collateral damage and military advantage. Although it is hard to estimate excessiveness in cyberspace and to prevent it, there are methods to make a reasonable assessment. It is stated in the Allied Doctrine that: COs [cyberspace operations] will be conducted according to the operation plan. As such, SCEPVA [Sovereign Cyber Effects Provided Voluntarily by Allies], when authorised, might give the commander alternative options to create effects. These options are integrated, ¹⁷⁹.

At this point, the determination of the effects and excessiveness of an action will be based on the good faith of the combatant, its reasonableness and the circumstances in which the cyber attack is planned and executed.\n## 3.4 Effective warning It is stated in Article 57(2)(c) of the AP-I that ‘effective advance warning shall be given of attacks which may affect the civilian population, unless circumstances do not permit’. The first appearance of this rule can be traced back to the Lieber Code, in which it was stated that: Commanders, whenever admissible, inform the enemy of their intention to bombard a place, so that the noncombatants, and especially the women and children, may be removed before the bombardment commences. But it is no infraction of the common law of war to omit thus to inform the enemy. Surprise may be a necessity.¹⁸⁷ As it can be observed from the article, if a party plans to conduct a surprise cyber attack, it does not need to give any warning so as not to endanger the success of the operation.¹⁸⁸ Surprise may be necessary in some cases, such as when there is a risk of a pre-emptive cyber attack or the exposure of a broader campaign.¹⁸⁹ The Tallinn Manual illustrates this by saying that: Consider, for example, a cyber operation involving placement of a kill-switch into the target computer’s control system, to be activated on the occurrence of some future event or after the passage of a specified period. A warning that would give the enemy an opportunity to locate and neutralise the device need not be given.¹⁹⁰ Therefore, giving warning is limited to appropriate circumstances since an attacker may have special reasons that justify not giving any warning.¹⁹¹ A relevant consideration could be the equation comparing the level of military advantage between situations in which giving occurs and those in which it does not. If the gap justifies civilian harm, then the attacking party does not need to give a warning in advance.\nIf it is expected that the cyber attack will exclusively affect civilian objects and not have any impact on civilians, then giving warning will not be necessary.¹⁹² By approving this point, the Australian Military Manual states that the warning can be directed at civilians, who bear the dangers posed by an intended attack, or at responsible authorities.¹⁹³ In that vein, if harm to civilians is expected, then they can be warned in many ways through ¹⁸⁶.

Even though the Australian Military Manual suggests adopting ‘commonsense’ to achieve effectiveness, this does not clarify the notion but adds extra blurriness to it.¹⁹⁷ On the other hand, the term ‘effective’ is defined in the dictionary as ‘producing a decided, decisive, or desired effect’.¹⁹⁸ Based on this definition, it can at least be said that in order for a warning to be effective, it should aim to reduce collateral damage to a minimum. To accomplish this, the content of the warning should be reasonably clear and specific so that civilians have a chance to secure themselves from the effects of an attack.¹⁹⁹ Both of these terms should be determined based on the context. In terms of clarity, rather than giving technical details, belligerent parties may underline the effects of cyber attacks and provide guidelines to civilians on how to protect themselves from such effects. In terms of specificity, there is no requirement to give a specific warning for every situation; the warning may be general in a way that provides a list of cyber objectives that might be targeted.²⁰⁰ Overall, there is no one correct method to issuing effective warnings, but they should be tailored to diverse scenarios to protect civilians.\nWarnings can be conducted through an enemy if it makes the warning more effective.²⁰¹ However, such a warning can also be used as a ruse of war. For example, ‘a false announcement of a cyber attack affecting dual-use systems might prove militarily useful in causing the enemy to take its military assets off-line’.²⁰² Nevertheless, if it is expected that such a warning causes civilians to ignore future real warnings and to put them in danger, then this will be prohibited.²⁰³ Further, the belligerent party should not give a warning in order to spread terror among civilians.²⁰⁴ As stated in Article 51(2) of the AP-I, ‘[a]cts or threats of violence the primary purpose of which is to spread terror among the civilian population are prohibited’. For this reason, warnings given through cyberspace that aim to ‘frighten or cause panic among residents or compel them to leave their homes for reasons other than their safety’ are forbidden.²⁰⁵ Although there is always a danger for civilians to be exposed to fake news via the Internet without the knowledge of the attacking party, it is also their obligation to search for the truth.\n© 2023 The Author Journal compilation © 2023 Edward Elgar Publishing Ltd Downloaded from https://www.elgaronline.com/ at 07/16/2025 08:36:46PM via University College London (UCL)</https:> The application of the principle of precautions to cyber operations 31 # 3.5 The least danger rule It is stated in Article 57(3) of the AP-I that: When a choice is possible between several military objectives for obtaining a similar military advantage, the objective to be selected shall be that the attack on which may be expected to cause the least danger to civilian lives and to civilian objects.\nFrom the perspective of this article, if a commander has more than one option, then the rule can be applicable. Therefore, this rule is also known as ‘the lesser of two evils’.²⁰⁶ The rationale behind the article is simple: While a commander is trying to get the maximum effect on the military capacity of the enemy, he/she should seek an option which has minimum effect on civilians. The example given in the Official Commentary is that ‘[i]nstead of attacking railway stations, which are usually located in towns, the railway lines were hit at crucial points, but away from inhabited areas; the same action was taken with respect to roads’.²⁰⁷ By analogy, it can be stated that cyber attacks should be conducted against specific networks of electricity distribution facilities rather than the whole power station.²⁰⁸ However, the rule comes into scene when two different options promise military advantage at the same level.²⁰⁹ Otherwise, the attack is subject to other provisions and principles, i.e., proportionality.\nThere are two critical discussions to have while inflicting the least amount of harm on civilians and civilian property. First, whether or not causing harm to civilians and civilian property is equally important. At this point, while discussing the Kosovo Conflict, General Clark states that ‘[w]e weren’t going to disregard risks to civilians but the alternative to taking risks with property damage was that we might ultimately have to put our troops in on the ground’.²¹⁰ From this example, it seems that objects have less value than civilian lives in practice. However, cyber operations are more likely to have effects on objects than on people. Therefore, the relevant discussion may be whether all objects have the same value in cyberspace. At this point, Henderson offers to determine the value of objects by various factors such as ‘the “utility” of the object, the objects “replace-ability”, and the cost of replacement’.²¹¹ In that vein, in terms of utility, it may be preferable to have an impact on financial records rather than medical data in cyberspace. The second discussion is whether belligerent parties put civilians at greater risk than their own troops. Although some states and scholars adopt the opinion that the security of armed forces should be included in military advantage,²¹² another approach holds that the armed forces must accept the risks posed by combat actions, and those risks should not be borne by civilians.²¹³ The present author considers that an attacking party who conducts cyber attacks against an enemy already minimizes the dangers of combat for its own troops because of their remoteness ²⁰⁶.

Therefore, it should not disregard civilian damage by claiming force protection.\nBeyond mere humanitarianism, it is a military reality to target legitimate objectives to the maximum extent while harming civilians to the minimum. Carnahan states that '[t]he wise military officer will try to concentrate firepower on key military objectives and to keep to a minimum the collateral damage not only for humanitarian reasons, but also because munitions that injure civilians are wasted munitions'.[214] When the humanitarian impacts of such 'wasted munitions' are considered along with their military value, it is a well-known fact that when civilian harm increases, the likelihood of success of the mission decreases, so belligerent parties should aim to put the least amount of risk on civilians if there is an opportunity to refrain from it while gaining a military advantage at the same level, or at least another option that significantly decreases the military advantage.[215] # 4 PRECAUTIONS AGAINST THE EFFECTS OF CYBER OPERATIONS ## 4.1 General remarks It is stated in Article 58 of the AP-I that: The Parties to the conflict shall, to the maximum extent feasible: (a) without prejudice to Article 49 of the Fourth Convention, endeavour to remove the civilian population, individual civilians and civilian objects under their control from the vicinity of military objectives; (b) avoid locating military objectives within or near densely populated areas; (c) take the other necessary precautions to protect the civilian population, individual civilians and civilian objects under their control against the dangers resulting from military operations.\nThe rationale behind the article is to abstain from 'defensive tactics that unnecessarily increases civilian risk' by endangering civilians and civilian objects to the detrimental effects of military operations.[216] For this reason, belligerent parties should segregate their military objectives from civilians and civilian objectives; if this is not possible, they should at least protect these people and objects from the effects of cyber operations.[217] The rule is applicable within the territory of the belligerent party, which is responsible for the protection of its nationals or people under its control.[218] However, this territorial application of the rule may pose a significant hurdle in cyberspace. Although it was claimed that 'all civilian cyber infrastructure and activities located in territory under the control of a party to the conflict are subject to this Rule', this approach cannot be applicable in cyberspace since it is almost impossible to control every civilian activity in this domain.[219] This follows a risk that a responsible government may claim © 2023 The Author Journal compilation © 2023 Edward Elgar Publishing Ltd Downloaded from https://www.elgaronline.com/ at 07/16/2025 08:36:46PM via University College London (UCL) The application of the principle of precautions to cyber operations 33 that ‘it does not have authority over most of the cyber infrastructure due to the various legal regimes that exist within the nation’.²²⁰ At this point, the term ‘control’ refutes such a defence by obligating the party to protect civilians and civilian property by segregating civilian computer systems if it has a capacity to control these systems.²²¹ As a result, this obligation should not be applied by taking territorial concerns into account but rather by considering whether or not these systems are under the de facto control of a party.\nThese precautions are applicable as soon as they are ‘to the maximum extent feasible’. Although the term ‘feasible’ was explained in the first chapter, the Official Commentary further clarifies this term by noting that those measures should ‘not go beyond the point where the life of the population would become difficult or even impossible’.²²² Also, the Tallinn Manual explains the term ‘maximum extent’ in a way that it ‘emphasises the importance of taking the requisite measures’.²²³ According to one approach, those measures can be applied depending upon ‘the requirements of national defence’ as stated in the declaration of Austria.²²⁴ From this perspective, parties do not need to expose all of their military facilities, or to put them in a more dangerous position by considering the dictations of the national defence.²²⁵ This is explained in Official Records by the delegation of the Republic of Korea with the following words: [T]his provision does not constitute a restriction on a State’s military installations on its own territory. We consider that military facilities necessary for a country’s national defence should be decided on the basis of the actual needs and other considerations of that particular country. An attempt to regulate a country’s requirements and the fulfilment of those requirements in this connexion would not conform to actualities.²²⁶ This is a valid argument since, as described in the first chapter, the principle of precautions obligates parties to take measures when they are ‘practicable or practically possible’. For this reason, every country has to take precautions against the effects of cyber attacks within its own limits.\nWhile the term ‘constant care’ is not explicitly stated in the article, it is still a valid consideration which should be taken into account in order to alleviate risks to civilians and civilian property.²²⁷ At this point, Corn points three reasons why constant care should be taken in both active and passive precautions:²²⁸ First, there is no clear line between ‘attacking’ and ‘defending’ parties in terms of operational art since every armed force needs to conduct both types of operations in the conflict. Second, ‘constant care’ obliges all parties of an armed conflict to conduct their operations by taking civilian harm into account as well as seeking to gain military advantage. This obligation cannot be confined to the attacking party. Third, the exclusion of defending © 2023 The Author Journal compilation © 2023 Edward Elgar Publishing Ltd Downloaded from https://www.elgaronline.com/ at 07/16/2025 08:36:46PM via University College London (UCL) The Military Law and the Law of War Review, Vol. 61 No. 1 forces from taking constant care may permit them to pose more risks to civilians as a defensive measure. When the nature of cyberspace is taken into account, the obligation becomes more important than conventional warfare since the domain has many more complexities than other areas.\nThese measures are similarly sampled in the ICRC Challenge Report and the Tallinn Manual while discussing feasible precautions against the effects of cyber attacks: [S]egregating military from civilian cyber infrastructure; segregating computer systems on which critical civilian infrastructure depends from the Internet; backing up important civilian data; making advance arrangements to ensure the timely repair of important computer systems; digitally recording important cultural or spiritual objects to facilitate reconstruction in the event of their destruction; and using anti-virus measures to protect civilian systems that might suffer damage or destruction during an attack on military cyber infrastructure.²²⁹ This is not an exhaustive list, and every situation may require different precautions to be taken.",
    "## 4.2 The segregation of civilian networks As it is indicated above, Article 58(a) of the AP-I requires parties to ‘endeavour to remove the civilian population, individual civilians and civilian objects under their control from the vicinity of military objectives’. The obligation should be applied when there is an immediate danger to civilians, and they should be evacuated them from the territory ‘where the risk of attack is greatest’.²³⁰ Even if this measure brings some difficulty to civilians, it aims to protect them from greater suffering, and alternative accommodations should be provided.²³¹ If these measures are not achieved, this can be deemed forced displacement and a violation of international law.": "Whilst the rule seems applicable when traditional battlefield is taken into account, it still creates some problems. For example, the rule was opposed by Switzerland because of its geographical conditions, where most civilians live in valleys in which important military facilities are located due to the limited number of useful locations in the country, so it becomes very hard to segregate civilians and civilian objects from the proximity of these facilities.²³² The same hardship is applicable for some facilities that can be important for both civilians and military personnel, such as air traffic control centres and power generation plants.²³³ On the other hand, the application of the rule in cyberspace brings more difficulty than in traditional domains. Civilian infrastructures are used for almost all cyber operations, and most of them have a dual nature.²³⁴ As an example, how can civilians be removed from cloud technology, which is also used for military purposes?²³⁵ Nevertheless, it is argued in a legal assessment published by the US Department of Defence that ‘[w]here there is a choice … military systems should be kept separate from ²²⁹.

The United States military uses multiple, dedicated networks to conduct administrative, logistical and operational activities. The three best-known networks are the Non-Classified Internet Protocol Router Network (NIPRnet, which carries information classified up to and including Sensitive but Unclassified), Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRnet, which carries data classified up to and including the Secret level) and the Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communication System (JWICS carries data classified up to and including Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information).²³⁹ As this example clearly shows, it is imperative to segregate the different types of networks, even if it can be costly.²⁴⁰ Otherwise, if the object makes an effective contribution and the segregation cannot be established, then the whole cyber infrastructure would be a lawful target.²⁴¹ Governmental and civilian data can be stored in the public cloud, despite the fact that this does not literally satisfy the criteria for segregation. However, the Russia-Ukraine War proved its usefulness in terms of reducing cyber dangers. The Ukrainian government moved an important part of the state’s digital infrastructure to the public cloud in preparation for Russian cyber operations against its governmental data center.²⁴² In this sense, cloud technology turns the disadvantage of cyber infrastructure’s interconnectedness into an advantage. As a more advanced example, the Estonian government established a ‘data embassy’ whose ‘resources are under Estonian state control, secured against cyberattacks or crisis situations with KSI [Keyless Signature Infrastructure] Blockchain technology, and are capable not only providing data backups, but also operating the most critical services’.²⁴³ The particular advantage of such precautions compared with network segregation is that they protect civilian data not only from cyber attacks but also from other types of crises that might occur within states’ borders, such as natural disasters or kinetic attacks.²⁴⁴ If such precautions impose a significant burden on the belligerent and are not feasible solutions, belligerent parties should search for other ways to shield civilian © 2023 The Author Journal compilation © 2023 Edward Elgar Publishing Ltd Downloaded from https://www.elgaronline.com/ at 07/16/2025 08:36:46PM via University College London (UCL)</https:> The Military Law and the Law of War Review, Vol. 61 No. 1 networks against cyber operations.²⁴⁵ The pertinent precaution could be the establishment of ‘digital safe havens’ through agreements between belligerent parties; while some systems may be difficult to negotiate due to their potential assistance to the adversary’s military effort, other systems critical to civilian life may be easily agreed upon.²⁴⁶ ## 4.3 The location of military objectives It is stated in Article 58(b) of the AP-I that belligerent parties should ‘avoid locating military objectives within or near densely populated areas’. From this perspective, parties to the conflict should refrain from locating both movable and immovable objects close to densely populated areas in order to protect civilians under their control.²⁴⁷ Nevertheless, the rule should not be limited to densely populated areas but also include ‘hospitals, cultural property, places of worship, prisoner of war camps, and other facilities which are entitled to specific protection’²⁴⁸ by refraining from locating cyber military objectives in or around them.\nWhile the applicability of the rule is understood in a physical sense, and social media or other similar civilian websites ‘cannot be equated with densely populated areas’, the rule obliges parties to take measures by considering cyber infrastructures which are physically located in the territory of a party.²⁴⁹ Therefore, for instance, army cyber commands should not be located in places where civilians or special protected objects can be put in danger. However, there is a significant hurdle to locating defence ministries in a place which is not close to densely populated areas. On the other hand, it is still possible for parties to exclude these kinds of facilities, which are military in nature but almost impossible to locate in isolated places, from the ambit of the attack through negotiation. Even if they cannot be attacked, it is possible for a party to conduct disruptive cyber operations against cyber infrastructures in these facilities. At this point, cyber operations give a unique opportunity to parties not to harm civilians but to still have an impact on the military capacity of their enemies.\n## 4.4 Other passive measures As it is stated above, belligerent parties should ‘take the other necessary precautions to protect the civilian population, individual civilians and civilian objects under their control against the dangers resulting from military operations’ according to Article 58(c) of the AP-I. While there is no limit on the scope of the rule, the Official Commentary states that this rule should be applied to civilians by providing them with protective shelters, as well as to specially protected objects by providing trained personnel to limit damage to them.²⁵⁰ However, conflicting parties should take all feasible precautions by taking the gap-filling function of Article 58(c) into account.\n²⁴⁵.

For example, civilians might be supported by providing them with software products such as anti-virus programs that limit the damage from cyber attacks, detecting civilian cyber systems in order to warn people in case of intrusion attempts, providing them technical assistance when their computer systems are harmed, providing a back-up system to store civilian data, blocking particular IP addresses which pose risks to civilian systems, and keeping ready a system that makes it possible to disconnect an entire country from the Internet when all measures are exhausted.²⁵² While the title of Article 58 includes ‘attacks’, paragraph (c) clearly states that some precautions should be applied to operations. Although Jensen admits the ambiguity of this situation, he argues that countries which are not parties to the AP-I have responsibility arising from this provision for those acts that reach ‘attack’ threshold.²⁵³ In the Tallinn Manual, even though the majority of experts stated that the rule is applicable only to cyber attacks because of the title of the article and the non-existence of customary law, the minority focused on the wording of paragraph (c) by accepting cyber operations within the ambit of this rule.²⁵⁴ Therefore, the minority view kept the threshold lower, determined disruptive operations to be covered by this rule, and obligated parties to take precautions against the effects of these operations.²⁵⁵ However, both parties have a common understanding on the non-application of the rule to ‘mere inconvenience or irritation’.²⁵⁶ There is no clear-cut answer on which precautions should be taken within the ambit of Article 58(c), since the provision serves as a gap-filler in the article. Despite the fact that it did not receive much attention in the past because the suitability of other provisions for kinetic activities made them more visible than paragraph (c), their relative unsuitability for cyber operations rendered this clause more important. At this point, the implementation of the norm in cyberspace has already begun to be shaped by the practices of both state and non-state actors, and this trend seems to be continuing and getting better. For example, the US government has begun to warn private entities when they are subjected to transborder cyber attacks and has provided them with cyber tools and training to combat those attacks.²⁵⁷ Furthermore, the Security Service of Ukraine informs civilians about cyber threats and what measures to take in order to avoid them.²⁵⁸ As a recent innovative example, the ICRC has been conducting research on creating a ‘digital emblem’ for the past two years in order to enable the identification of objects, systems, or networks that cannot be subject to cyber attacks.²⁵⁹ Lastly, even though these are individual precautionary measures, the Russia-Ukraine War has also demonstrated how state and non-state entities can collaborate to © 2023 The Author Journal compilation © 2023 Edward Elgar Publishing Ltd Downloaded from https://www.elgaronline.com/ at 07/16/2025 08:36:46PM via University College London (UCL)</https:> The Military Law and the Law of War Review, Vol. 61 No. 1 protect civilians from the effects of cyber operations. The Microsoft Report highlights two examples of cyber security measures against Russian cyber activities: The first has been the use of technology acquired from RiskIQ that identifies and maps organizational attack surfaces, including devices that are unpatched against known vulnerabilities and therefore are the most susceptible to attack. This information has been shared with the Ukrainian government free of charge to enable it to accelerate the strengthening of cyber-defenses. Ukrainian network defenders worked tirelessly with the constant support of the CERT UA within the government to use this information to protect computers across the country.\nThe second measure has been a wartime innovation pursued with the collaboration and support of the Ukrainian government. MSTIC recognized that Russian malware could be mitigated meaningfully by turning on a feature in Microsoft Defender called controlled folder access. This typically would require that IT administrators access devices across their organization, work made more difficult and potentially even dangerous in wartime conditions. The Ukrainian government therefore authorized Microsoft through special legal measures to act proactively and remotely to turn on this feature across devices throughout the government and across the country.²⁶⁰ Every effort having a purpose to minimize collateral damage is desired in cyberspace; the principle of precaution essentially relies on the processes but not the results.",
    "# 5 CONCLUSION New technologies have changed the nature of armed conflict significantly, and this process increasingly continues. As one kind of these technologies, cyber operations have introduced significant challenges to the LOAC, but the most unique one is their capability to have a wide range of effects because of the interconnectedness of cyberspace. This article has endeavoured to determine the application of the principle of precautions to cyber operations by tilting the principle towards humanity by considering the natures of both the principle and cyberspace.": "From the standpoint of the principle of precautions, the Russia-Ukraine War exemplified an important phenomenon: public-private cooperation against adversarial cyber operations. Unlike traditional domains, private entities have a partial but critical level of control over cyberspace, and as a result of this distinctive feature of the current conflicts, the Ukrainian government collaborated with a technology giant, Microsoft.²⁶¹ This collaboration is emphasized in the Microsoft Report by stating that: [U]nlike the traditional threats of the past, cyber defenses rely on a unique level of public and private collaboration. The evolving threat landscape requires a whole-of-society approach. The private sector, particularly technology companies, are on the front lines of cyber and information attacks. Likewise, civil society organizations are key conveners that play a crucial role in engagement, sometimes are involved in cyber data analysis, and are often targets of these campaigns themselves.²⁶² Bringing non-public entities into the equation in cyberspace, thereby putting more civilians in the balance, would enhance the ‘civilianization’ of armed conflicts, and this would inherently lean the principle of precaution on the side of humanity.\n²⁶⁰.

However, despite its practical importance, the principle of precautions seems to trail behind the other two concepts. This negligence extends not only to scholarly works but also to military doctrines. While the first two principles are often referred to as ‘principles’ in military manuals, the third does not have such a privilege. Nonetheless, it not only confirms or supplements these former principles but also prescribes some preliminary measures to avoid violating them.\nOn the other hand, the Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC) rules, which regulate the application of the principle of precautions, were designed to be applied during conventional warfare. Due to the interconnected nature of the cyber domain, however, it is difficult to apply these rules to cyber operations. Before discussing the complexity posed by the interconnectivity of cyberspace, it should be admitted that it is not unique to the cyber domain; traditional domains have this problem too. Almost half a century ago, the reality that there is ‘a geographical and functional mixture of combatants and civilians and military objectives and civilian objects’ in the conduct of military air\n1.

Despite the similarity between the traditional and cyber domains in terms of interconnectivity, what makes interconnectivity special regarding cyber military operations is that it ‘characterises cyberspace, which means that whatever has an interface with the Internet can be affected by cyber operations conducted from anywhere in the world’. In such a complex environment, the adoption of the principle of precautions while planning and executing cyber operations has utmost importance.\nThe interconnectivity problem should be approached from two perspectives, taking into account both the technical and the social factors. From the first standpoint, technical factors intensify the interconnectedness between military and civilian networks in cyberspace, therefore converting this domain into one of entirely dual-use nature and obstructing the distinction between military targets and civilian objects. As Jensen points out, ‘[w]ith 98% of day-to-day government communications routinely travelling over civilian communication lines, there will be many civilian lines of communication that will carry targetable electronic traffic intermixed with civilian traffic’. From this vantage point, not only is it highly difficult to make a certain distinction between civilian and military cyber infrastructures, but practically all military cyber activities must be carried out through dual-use cyber systems. In the absence of precautionary measures against such interconnectivity, the impacts of cyber activities might quickly spread to other systems across the globe and have the potential to significantly disrupt daily civilian life by having adverse impacts on civilian critical infrastructure and other associated systems. From this point of view, a cyber operation designed to disrupt a dual-used power plant located in a belligerent state could easily impair other systems, from water and food to ICT infrastructure, and its unintended effects might spill over into neutral countries.\nFrom the second point of view, interconnection becomes a more complicated matter when social factors are considered. Even though they are less obvious than technical ones, they still pose threats comparable to those of the latter, and it necessitates especially defensive parties to take unique precautionary measures. Therefore, it has been\n4. US Department of the Air Force, AF Pamphlet 110-31: International Law – The Conduct of Armed Conflict and Air Operations (1976) 5–10.\n5.

This perspective would reveal just how many components are connected and demonstrate the levels of complexity in a facility’. This entails that the human workforce of a facility needs to be considered in terms of the complexity of the system’s network. When this fact about a single facility is considered along with the global challenge of interconnectivity, the magnitude of the interconnectivity issue could be better understood.\nGiven that measures to prevent adversarial effects on cyber systems cannot keep up with their level of interconnectivity, this article aims to portray how to apply the principle of precautions to cyber operations and answers this question by taking its humanity-based character into account. The present author acknowledges that the articles articulating the principle of precautions are vague, as stated by state delegates during the negotiations of Additional Protocol-I or by state legal advisers. Such views on specific provisions of the article or the article as a whole are expressed using terms like ‘open to a variety of interpretations by the conflicting parties’ (for Article 57(2)(a)(ii)), ‘subjective’ ‘ambiguous’ (for Article 57(2)(a)), ‘deficient in clarity due to its generally vague wording’ (for Article 57), and ‘too general’ (for articles between 48 and 58). Moreover, delegates emphasized the hardships posed by applying these provisions in practice. When the complexity of cyberspace interconnectivity is combined with the ambiguity of the articles, applying the principle of precautions appears to bring together two ‘unknown unknowns’ in order to reach one ‘known known’. Throughout this piece of research, the author attempts to emphasize the humanity-based character of the principle of precautions in order to convert this ambiguity into a flexibility to apply the rules more effectively.\nThe LOAC, in general, aims to achieve a balance between military necessity and humanity.

In other words, ‘[t]he thrust is not absolute elimination of the calamities of war (a goal which would manifestly be utopian), but relief from the tribulations of war “as much as possible” bearing in mind that war is fought to be won’. At this point, it sounds rational that these two notions should be balanced while applying the principles governing the conduct of hostilities.\nOn the other hand, considering the peculiarity of interconnectedness in cyberspace, this balance should be leaned toward humanity while applying the principle of precautions. There are some reasons in favour of such an interpretation. To begin with, the notion of ‘balance’ is significantly subjective. From a practitioner perspective, when the armed conflict starts, reality does not permit such a compromise, and the perception of ‘balance’ is determined by those on the battlefield. However, outside of the conflict, such a balance could be perceived differently by scholars or judges who need to evaluate the legality of such actions, and their views seem more ‘humanitarian’ to practitioners. As stated by Luban, ‘[f]or military lawyers, the starting point is military necessity, and the reigning assumption is that legal regulation of war must accommodate military necessity. For humanitarian lawyers, the starting point is human dignity and human rights’. As a result, such disparities in viewpoints considerably alter the perception of balance, and trying to achieve a balance in the principle of precautions seems to be a rhetorical word.\nApart from the subjectivity of balance depending on different perceptors, the nature of the LOAC principles inherently provides a lean toward either military necessity or humanity. While the principles of distinction and proportionality are more eligible to\nmore generally’. See A Sari and K Tinkler, ‘Collateral Damage and the Enemy’ (2019) British Yearbook of International Law 63. From the standpoint of this article, military necessity is held as a permission giving to a belligerent party in order to ‘apply any amount and kind of force to compel the complete submission of the enemy with the least possible expenditure of time, life, and money’ by not violating the LOAC. See The Hostage Case, Case No. 7 (United States v. Wilhelm List et al.), (Opinion and Judgment and Sentence) [1949] 1253 (‘The Hostage Case’). Pictet defines humanity as ‘a sentiment of active goodwill towards mankind’ by referring to Littré’s dictionary. See J Pictet, The Fundamental Principles of the Red Cross (1956) 143. By considering this definition, this article holds the principle of humanity as a ‘guiding principle that puts a brake on undertakings which might otherwise be justified by the principle of military necessity’.

The crux of the former principles is based on gaining military advantage on the battlefield, and the notion of military advantage ‘has a particular resonance with “military necessity”’. This naturally bends those principles’ interpretation in the direction of military necessity. On the other hand, the central tenet of the principle of precautions is based on the minimization of civilian harm. It obliges belligerent parties to take active or passive precautionary measures to mitigate risks, which derive from military operations, towards civilians and civilian property in armed conflicts. In line with this, it is not good enough for soldiers ‘merely not intending civilian harm’, but they also ‘must intend not to harm civilians’.\nGiven that the nature of the principles requires that they be construed by leaning towards one side, analyzing the principle of precautions by considering the balance poses a risk that it turns into an ‘illusory rule’. According to Schwarzenberger:\n[Illusory rules]... are merely a formal compromise between the standard of civilization and the necessities of war. Here, in fact the rule of force is supreme. Rules which expressly proclaim the necessities of war as an overriding constituent element or are emasculated by an ‘as far as possible’ clause illustrate this perhaps slightly hypocritical variant of the rules of warfare.\nThus, by turning the principle into an ‘illusory rule’, it would be very easy for belligerent parties to refrain from effectively applying the principle of precautions by putting terms such as ‘feasible’ or ‘unless circumstances do not permit’ on the table. To preclude such excuses, one should hold it as a rule that ‘sets limitations to warfare in cases in which considerations of civilization demand priority over military interest’. As correctly held by the Madagascar delegate, ‘[t]he article reflected a laudable desire to narrow the gap between the ideal and the possible, and to deal from a humanitarian standpoint with two opposite positions, namely, the aggressor’s and the victim’s’. Per this point of view, the application of the principle of precautions by taking ‘one small step’ toward humanity could be ‘one giant leap’ toward a more appropriate\n.

When the inherent bending of these principles toward military necessity and only their recognition as ‘principles’ in military manuals are considered, the consequence is admitted by Maurer that ‘[i]n more than one context, the balance between military “necessity” and protection concerns has heavily tilted towards military logics, and norms have been implicitly downgraded to mere discretionary guidance’.

In section 3, the precautions that shall be taken by the attacking side of the conflict according to Article 57 of Additional Protocol-I will be examined. In the first part of the section, target verification in cyber operations will be discussed, and some important questions will be answered, e.g., does technical superiority play any role on the precautionary level? Or what is the requisite level of certainty? In the second part, the choice of cyber means and methods will be addressed. The proportionality rule in precautions in planning and executing cyber attacks will be determined in the third part. Not only will key terms such as ‘military advantage’ and ‘incidental harm’ be discussed in that section, but also some grey areas, e.g., the consideration of indirect effects. The fourth part will explain effective warning before launching cyber attacks, and the final part will explain the least-danger rule. In the fourth section, precautions that shall be taken by a party that is subject to cyber operations will be addressed. In this chapter, the segregation of civilian and military objectives in cyberspace, the location of cyber military objectives, and other measures will be questioned, respectively.\n## 2 THE REGULATION OF THE PRINCIPLE OF PRECAUTIONS, BASIC TERMS AND RESPONSIBILITY\n### 2.1 The regulation of the principle of precautions\nWhile it is not stated conspicuously, the first implication of the principle of precautions can be found in Article 27 of the Hague Convention IV, in which it is stated that:\nIn sieges and bombardments all necessary steps must be taken to spare, as far as possible, buildings dedicated to religion, art, science, or charitable purposes, historic monuments, hospitals, and places where the sick and wounded are collected, provided they are not being used at the time for military purposes.\nIn the following process, the prohibition to launch an attack against civilians and to spare them as much as possible found a place in various official documents. However, the first binding regulation of the principle of precautions appeared in the AP-I,\n. ‘The principles of distinction, precautions and proportionality thus complement each other in a way that achieves a subtle balance between military necessity and humanitarian imperatives.’ See Sari and Tinkler (fn 21) 4.\n. International Conferences (The Hague), Hague Convention (IV) Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land and Its Annex: Regulations Concerning the Laws and Customs of War on Land, 18 October 1907.\n. See League of Nations Res ‘Protection of Civilian Populations Against Bombing from the Air in Case of War’ (30 September 1938). Later, more detailed rules were articulated in Articles 8, 9 and 11 of the Draft Rules for the Limitation of the Dangers incurred by the Civilian Population in Time of War (1956). Despite the fact that states did not adopt these rules, they had an impact on the rules codified in Additional Protocols. See S Watts, ‘Law-of-War Precautions: A Cautionary Note’ in RTP Alcala and E Talbot Jensen (eds), The Impact of Emerging Technologies on the Law of Armed Conflict (Oxford University Press, 2019) 116.\n© 2023 The Author\nJournal compilation © 2023 Edward Elgar Publishing Ltd\nDownloaded from https://www.elgaronline.com/ at 07/16/2025 08:36:46PM via University College London (UCL)\nThe Military Law and the Law of War Review, Vol. 61 No. 1\nin which it is stated that both attacking and defending parties shall take precautions to spare civilians and civilian objects in an armed conflict. At this point, for *jus in bello* cyberspace operations, the principle of precautions provides a twofold protection: the first comprises taking constant care while conducting cyber attacks ('precautions in attack'), and the second comprises taking feasible precautions in order to protect civilians from the effects of cyber attacks ('precautions against the effects of attacks') during armed conflicts. These precautions can also be named 'active' and 'passive' precautions ruled under Articles 57 and 58 of the AP-I.\nThe rules stated in Articles 57 and 58 are applied in times of armed conflicts, though the definition of 'armed conflict' is not provided in the Protocol. In this article, the definition given in the Tadic Decision, in which it was described as 'a resort to armed force between States or protracted armed violence between governmental authorities and organized armed groups or between such groups within a State',[39] is adopted. From this definition, it can be stated that there are two types of armed conflicts; 'between States' (international armed conflicts), and 'between governmental authorities and organized armed groups or between such groups' (non-international armed conflicts). In identifying the nature of the conflict, the status of the actors is the decisive factor.[40] The importance of this distinction is that while the AP-I, which is applicable to international armed conflicts, clearly states the obligation to take precautions, there is no clear provision which regulates the principle of precautions in Additional Protocol-II,[41] which is applicable to non-international armed conflicts. However, it does not prevent the application of the principle to the latter type of conflicts since it is stated in Article 13(1) of the AP-II that '[t]he civilian population and individual civilians shall enjoy general protection against the dangers arising from military operations'. Therefore, it is argued in the work of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) on Customary Rules that, by approving the customary nature of the principle for both international and non-international armed conflict, it is hard to abide by such a rule without taking any precaution.[42] Moreover, it is stated in the Tadic Decision that 'all necessary precautions should be taken to avoid injury, loss or damage to civilian populations' in all kinds of armed conflicts by referring to a resolution adopted by the United Nations General Assembly.[43] Finally, two recent treaties that are applicable to non-international armed conflicts explicitly regulate the principle of precautions.[44]\n39.

However, when these provisions are read together with Article 49, it might cause confusion in the first instance because while Article 49(3) clearly restricts the application of Section IV rules of the AP-I to operations conducted in the air or sea which have impacts on ‘civilians or civilian objects on land’, Article 57(4) seems to obligate parties to respect the principle of precautions in the conduct of these operations without any limitation. To solve this problem, one should deem Article 57(4) as ‘merely a restatement of one of the existing rules’. As Article 49(3) makes clear, the article does not affect those rules that are customary in nature and applicable to all types of military operations. Therefore, Article 57(4) does not contradict but rather ‘complement’ it.\nSince the principle of precautions applies to both operations and attacks, both of these terms should be clarified. At this point, military operations are ‘any movements, manoeuvres and other activities whatsoever carried out by the armed forces with a view to combat’. Therefore, all parties to the conflict should exercise constant care while conducting their military operations. For instance, if a tank driver harms civilian property while maneuvering the vehicle, he/she will be responsible due to the breach of the principle of precautions. From this perspective, if a perpetrator destroys a civilian network while conducting cyber exploitation against either a civilian or military cyber system, he/she will bear responsibility. However, military attacks require a certain threshold since they are violent acts causing death, injury, damage, or destruction – or at least intending to do so. As a result, all military attacks are kinds of military operations but vice versa would not be true. Therefore, while cyber operation can be defined as ‘the employment of cyber capabilities to achieve objectives in or through cyberspace’, cyber attack is ‘a cyber operation, whether offensive or defensive, that is reasonably expected to cause injury or death to persons or damage or destruction to objects’. In light of this, cyber attack is a special kind of cyber operation that results in violent effects. However, cyber attacks require a broader understanding because damage to objects may occur as a secondary effect of cyber operations. Therefore, the present author agrees with the approach of the majority of the International Group of Experts (the Experts), who prepared the Tallinn Manual, that cyber operations that result in the replacement of a component by having an impact on the functionality of an object fall within the ambit of attack because, while these kinds of operations do not damage an object in the first instance, their effects in later phases reach the threshold of attack by causing physical harm.\n.

At this point, the applicability of international law to cyber operations is recognized by states and international organizations. Also, there is a certain difference between a cyber operation and an attack, and not all precautionary measures are applicable to all kinds of cyber operations.\n## 2.2 Constant care\nAccording to Article 57(1) of the AP-I, the attacking party shall always take ‘constant care’ to spare civilians and civilian objects while conducting military operations. The term ‘constant care’ is clarified in the HPCR Manual Commentary by stating that ‘there are no exceptions from the duty to seek to spare the civilian population, civilians and civilian objects’. Therefore, constant care obliges all levels of the armed forces who are responsible for planning, ordering or executing a cyber operation to always consider the results of it and try to minimize its effects on civilians.\nThe ‘constant care’ obligation is necessary for cyber operations. Those who are involved in the operation should always be aware of the foreseeable effects of operations on the civilian population and property and try to minimize these effects as much as possible. For this reason, it is not enough to demonstrate due care in the planning stage; this obligation extends to all stages of the operation in which civilians might be affected. In other words, these people should have ‘situational awareness at all times’. The concept of situational awareness is explained in the Allied Joint Doctrine for Cyberspace Operations by describing it as ‘a combination of a near real-time updated RCP [Recognised Cyberspace Picture], analysis and information management’. Although the obligation is constrained by the execution stage of an operation as described in the article, the effects of the attack can continue. For example, in the\n.

Although Jensen notes that this ‘at least implicates the constant-care standard and informs State practice on the issue’, the present author considers that the possible effects of the cyber operations after their execution are better understood 10 years later, so states should seek to stop or at least limit the effects of operations after their military objective is accomplished.\nOn the other hand, the application of the rule in cyberspace poses a significant hurdle since almost all cyber operations might affect or harm civilian cyber infrastructure to some extent. However, after all feasible precautions have been taken by an attacker, the relevant rule will be proportionality. If the effects of the operation on civilians are not excessive compared to the anticipated military advantage, then the attacking party may continue to carry out cyber operations. However, the calculation may be difficult because of the time-sensitivity. Planned operations give more chance to the attacking party to take better precautions, though time-sensitive ones generally do not permit sufficient time to implement more suitable precautions. Although the impact of such a condition on precautions is not deniable, it does not give permission to the attacker to deviate from the principle because the constant care obligation necessitates parties to take feasible precautions in all circumstances.\nThe second significant hurdle might be the secretive nature of cyberspace since ambiguity is at the centre of cyber warfare. Even though attribution may be difficult in that domain and the perpetrator of cyber acts that violate the LOAC cannot be easily found, parties to the conflict should obey the rules of the LOAC by considering warrior ethics. From this perspective, cyber warriors should always seek ways to mitigate risks towards civilians in good faith since ‘[r]espect for LOAC obligations is the essential touchstone for that ethical foundation’. This ethical foundation serves for better protection of civilians, which is an inherent objective of the LOAC.\nLast but not least, the ‘constant care’ obligation should not be accepted as limited to this article. It involves all phases of operations and attacks, which are carried out by both attacking and defending parties. For this reason, it has a guidance function while examining all provisions of Articles 57 and 58.\n## 2.3 Feasibility\nArticle 57 obliges parties to take ‘feasible’ precautions in order to minimize the effects of an attack on civilians and civilian objects. In the Official Commentary of Article 57, it is stated that those precautions are ‘everything that was practicable or practically possible, taking into account all the circumstances at the time of the attack, including\n.

At this point, every situation has its unique features, and those responsible for an attack should adapt various precautions by considering the characteristics of the situation. For example, an attacker party should map the target network through exploitation operations if it is connected to other civilian networks.71 In such situations, LOAC not only permits cyber espionage but also obligates a belligerent party to conduct these operations. However, such operations require a certain level of technical expertise, and in the absence of that, such a network should not be exploited.72 Despite such expertise, some mistakes may occur in the 'fog of war'.73 At this point, a commander who took 'all due measures' is not responsible for this harm.74 Those measures can be identified by different factors such as available cyber means, time sensitivity, the cyber defence system of the enemy, the characteristics of the target, intelligence assets, the expertise of the attacking team, the loyalty of the enemy of to the LOAC, and available assets and vulnerabilities of the enemy.75 However, even if feasible precautions are taken, unintended results may occur for various reasons, such as failure of the intelligence system, dysfunction of the technology, or unexpected changes in tactical conditions.76 For instance, a commander might prepare a map of a cyber network before conducting an attack, but the virus unintentionally spreads among the civilian infrastructure, which has a connection with the military network.77 At this point, while deciding on whether the principle of precautions is respected or not, one should not focus on outcomes, but compliance should be measured by the process in which an\n68.

For instance, if an attacker has advanced cyber capabilities that make it possible to disrupt an electrical grid without harming civilians but prefers to carry out an attack by conventional means – which results in civilian damage – it cannot claim that its adversary does not use the same level of technology to refrain from harming civilians. Thus, it is true that each party has a responsibility ‘within its means or methods or its capability’ as stated by the Indian delegate.\nEven if the commander has advanced cyber weapons, he/she may try to spare them for use during later stages of the conflict by taking military considerations into account. Therefore, it is permitted for the military commander in the Naval Manual of Ecuador to use alternative methods ‘in light of all the facts known or reasonably available to him, including the need to conserve resources and complete the mission successfully’. However, if it is understood that using less advanced weapons will result in excessive collateral damage, then they should either use advanced ones or cancel the attack.\nOn the other hand, the determination of feasibility on a contextual basis should not be used to assuage the burden from the shoulders of the attacker. For example, the use of white phosphorus shells near al-Wafa hospital, where patients have serious injuries and need long-term care, by the Israeli armed forces was deemed a violation of Articles 57(2)(b) and (c) of the AP-I. It was stated that those who were responsible for the attack should be aware of ‘all the facts and circumstances’. For this reason, while conducting a cyber operation against a system in which some medical records may be located, the attacking party should take special care. The same is valid for facilities such as dams, where dangerous forces are located.\n## 2.4 Responsibility\nThe wording of Article 57 restricts its applicability to ‘those who plan or decide upon an attack’. Because of this wording, some states have expressed reservations about Article 57, claiming that it only applies to ‘commanding officers at the battalion or group level and those of higher ranks’. Nonetheless, every soldier who breaches obligations imposed by the LOAC bears individual criminal responsibility for his/her acts when such crimes are committed with ‘intent and knowledge’.

Also, it might be possible to operate in smaller groups in different types of warfare, such as national liberation wars or transnational armed conflicts. In line with this, the rule should be applied at ‘whatever level the regulated functions are being performed’ since every soldier who conducts military operations against an adversary by aiming to obtain military advantage participates in the decision-making process in the theatre of war. As a result, individuals ‘who have the authority and practical possibility to affect the course of an attack’ should be held accountable for cyber activities.\nIn cyberspace, it may be very hard to calculate the effects of an attack by planners or decision makers since the interconnectedness of civilian and military networks prevents the attacking party from properly calculating the effects of an attack and from taking feasible precautions in order to minimize them. Also, the velocity of computer systems operating at high speed makes it difficult to predict the indirect effects of cyber attacks. As it is stated in the ICRC Expert Meeting:\nOwing to how the internet is designed and operates, there will always be the risk of other systems or networks being affected. The reason is that volumetric attacks can end up using all available channel capacity, which would affect the networks on the path to the target. This has happened in the past, with powerful DDoS attacks launched against specific targets and affecting entire internet infrastructure providers.\nHowever, the unpredictability of effects does not relieve the responsibility of all levels of command while conducting operations. According to Watkin, operational factors cannot be put forward in order not to take feasible precautions in today’s trend, which pursues to compromise ‘human rights-like accountability frameworks with operational decision making during armed conflict’. Accordingly, all members of the armed forces who are part of operations in cyberspace should do everything feasible within their limits.\nWhile assessing the individual responsibility of officers, they should be judged by how much they know about a certain subject. The well-known example is the Rendulic Decision, in which the Nuremberg Tribunal held that ‘the “scorched earth” policy in\n Sandoz, Swinarski and Zimmermann (eds) (fn 3) 2197; APV Rogers, ‘General Report-Conduct of Combat and Risks Run by the Civilian Population’ (1982) 21 Mil.

For this reason, later evidence which showed that ‘the danger did not actually exist’$^{98}$ cannot be used to convict the commander since he ‘acted within the limits of honest judgment on the basis of the conditions prevailing at the time’.$^{99}$ This is crucial considering the interconnectivity of cyberspace since cyber attacks might affect civilian networks unexpectedly despite a commander’s employment of the advanced technology to conduct constant surveillance over a network.$^{100}$ At this point, the responsibility arising out of a cyber attack would not go beyond what the defendant knew at the time of the attack.\nOn the other hand, one needs to distinguish misinformation from misconception. Misconception of the nature of the target might occur because of cognitive bias, which misdirects attackers by analyzing information ‘in a manner that supports their pre-existing beliefs or mental frameworks’.$^{101}$ States should employ a variety of techniques such as ‘training and education, red teaming procedures, specific positive identification (PID) policies for targeting, use of structured analytic techniques, and other analytic tradecraft practices’ in order for this not to result in civilian damage.$^{102}$ Despite the fact that states are keen to protect soldiers in such situations,$^{103}$ inflicting civilian harm due to biased decisions does not very well fit with the notion of ‘honest judgement’.\nLastly, those who undertake cyber operations may be fully aware of the results of their actions owing to their technical expertise since cyberspace requires unique understanding compared to traditional domains. If a higher commander issues an order to launch a cyber operation without being aware of the outcomes in good faith, inferior commanders will be responsible for such intentional conduct. However, if a commander is aware that he lacks sufficient information about a target, he should either change the concept of the attack or refrain from issuing such an order.$^{104}$ Should an operation continue to be carried out while being aware of this insufficiency, responsibility arises.\n# 3 PRECAUTIONS IN ATTACK\n## 3.1 Target verification\nIt is stated in Article 57(2) of the AP-I that:\n(a) those who plan or decide upon an attack shall:\n(i) do everything feasible to verify that the objectives to be attacked are neither civilians nor civilian objects and are not subject to special protection but are military objectives within the\n97.

For this reason, an object that is military in nature should not be subject to attack if it does not effectively contribute to the military capacity of an enemy.^[107]^\nWhile only Article 52(2) of the AP-I has found its place in the provision, lawful targets also include people who can be made the object of direct cyber attacks. According to the LOAC, various categories of people can be held as lawful targets. The first one consists of combatants who are members of the armed forces and have a right to directly participate in hostilities.^[108]^ Even though they are lawful targets, they have a right to be treated as prisoners of war when they are captured by the enemy.^[109]^\nThe second category includes direct participants in hostilities. Although they are civilian in nature, they will be accepted as lawful targets if they meet three cumulative criteria which are: threshold of harm, direct causation and belligerent nexus.^[110]^ Those people are lawful targets 'for such time as they take a direct part in hostilities',^[111]^ and if they are captured, they cannot benefit from prisoner of war status.\nThe third category, though there is a discussion on it, consists of members of an organized armed group that is a belligerent party in an armed conflict. They are 'individuals whose continuous function involves the preparation, execution, or command of acts or operations amounting to direct participation in hostilities'.^[112]^\n105.

In the Interpretive Guidance on the Notion of Direct Participation in Hostilities, definitions of these criteria read as follows: '1. the act must be likely to adversely affect the military operations or military capacity of a party to an armed conflict or, alternatively, to inflict death, injury, or destruction on persons or objects protected against direct attack (threshold of harm), and 2. there must be a direct causal link between the act and the harm likely to result either from that act, or from a coordinated military operation of which that act constitutes an integral part (direct causation), and 3. the act must be specifically designed to directly cause the required threshold of harm in support of a party to the conflict and to the detriment of another (belligerent nexus).'

The result of this distinction is that those who directly participate in hostilities lose their protected status only for a limited period of time, but the last category of individuals loses it ‘as long as they remain members’, and this membership renders them lawful targets ‘even before he or she first carries out a hostile act’.\nAfter it was stated in the Official Commentary that the military commander does not need to have personal knowledge, it was argued that even if there is a ‘slight doubt’, additional information shall be obtained. By supporting it, Rogers points out that ‘[i]n the event of doubt about the nature of the target, an attack should not be carried out, with a possible exception where failure to prosecute the attack would put attacking forces in immediate danger’. However, this approach is challenged by some states, which claim that the determination should be ‘substantial doubt’ to suspend an attack and require supplementary information. In the same vein, various authors claimed that conducting military operations without having a doubt on the nature of a target is not a reasonable expectation in the fog of war. From this perspective, there is always some doubt as an inherent characteristic of combat. On the other hand, the present author thinks that the Official Commentary should be interpreted as the aim of a commander. By stating the ‘slight doubt’ requirement, the commentary obligates them to take better precautions even if it is possible to erase this doubt. This is approved by military practice, in which attacks are cancelled when combatants are not ‘certain’ or ‘100 percent sure of their aiming point’. According to Parks, the US achieved this level of accuracy during the Linebacker II campaign by constantly confirming the nature of targets, implementing rules set by the Strategic Air Command, and issuing bomb damage assessments after each attack. Despite the fact that such high-level precautions sometimes pose substantial risks to the combatants’ lives, he acknowledges that they are important not only in terms of legality but also for achieving military and political objectives. By considering such positive outcomes, a commander should be sure enough that he/she made reasonable efforts to verify the nature of the target in cyberspace.\n113. Ibid.\n114. Ibid at 34, 71.\n115.

At this point, cyber attack should be limited to that component, which is military in nature. If it is not possible, then the attack should be cancelled. However, this should not be equated with being ‘perfectly familiar with the network’ since such an interpretation is not appropriate with the term ‘feasible’.\n## 3.2 Choice of cyber means and methods\nAfter the nature of the target is verified, the next step will be to compose an operational plan that will have a minimum effect on civilians. At this point, it is stated in Article 57 (2)(a)(ii) of the AP-I that members of the armed forces should ‘take all feasible precautions in the choice of means and methods of attack with a view to avoiding, and in any event to minimising, incidental loss or civilian life, injury to civilians and damage to civilian objects’. This means that even if an attack is proportionate, parties to the conflict should be careful in their choice of means and methods in order to minimize the effects of attacks as much as possible while still aiming to obtain maximum military advantage. At this point, an attacking party should produce a plan that promises to give the most efficient operational and legal results.\nIt is important to define ‘cyber means’ and ‘methods’. Cyber means are defined as ‘cyber weapons and their associated cyber systems’ in the Tallinn Manual. At this point, cyber weapons are kinds of cyber means, but the latter includes a broader category. Cyber methods, on the other hand, are defined as ‘the cyber tactics, techniques, and procedures by which hostilities are conducted’. Whilst cyber means are concerned with which tools should be employed to carry out cyber operations, cyber methods are concerned with how these operations should be carried out. Based on this viewpoint, while botnets are a type of cyber means, the DDoS attack that is conducted by botnets can be considered a type of cyber method.\nThere is no weapon or method that is specifically prohibited in the provision. It only obliges parties to take feasible precautions by choosing appropriate means and methods; thereby, a commander will not be responsible for causing civilian harm. However, the rule does not require parties to choose means and methods that may decrease their expected military advantage. Even if alternative means and methods are not used because of this concern, a planned cyber attack must abide by other principles such as distinction and proportionality. On the other hand, if choosing different means and methods may change the degree of damage by producing ‘equivalent effects’ upon the target, then alternative means or methods shall be selected.

However, this may result in civilian deaths who live in the vicinity of the facility. At this point, if an attacking party has available means to conduct a cyber attack, it shall use them against the system or computers in the facility to stop belligerent attacks. Additionally, military personnel’s expertise with those new technologies is crucial. The concern was raised in the Eritrea-Ethiopia Claims Commission. Even though Eritrea refused Ethiopia’s allegations that some of its aircraft intentionally attacked civilians, the inexperience of Eritrean pilots in using ‘computerized aiming systems’, which led to the failure to target military objectives, was held as a violation of Article 57 of the AP-I. Lastly, a ‘target list’ can be prepared and constantly reviewed by belligerent parties in order to determine which type of weapon should be used to decrease civilian harm by considering the characteristics of the target. For example, the bombardment of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) compound by the Israeli Armed Forces, which resulted in extensive damage and endangered the lives of many civilians, was accepted as reckless conduct and a violation of Article 57(2)(a)(ii) of the AP-I since it was executed while being aware of its importance for civilians. However, in the Vietnam War, the US employed fragmentation bombs that had limited effects on the target to execute attacks against anti-aircraft batteries; since these batteries were located inside dikes, the army tried to refrain from damaging them.\nThe accuracy and range of weapons also have a particular importance in the execution of attacks. If a target can be destroyed by accurate weapons, then it does not make sense to use dumb bombs or other means whose effects may not be calculated properly or limited. In this sense, the US practice in the Linebacker II campaign is important. During the campaign, the B-52s that have wide-range effects were employed because of weather conditions and the limited number of the more precise weapons. But to keep the collateral damage to a minimum, the B-52s were used against targets that were either sufficiently large or in military-industrial complexes. Other objectives requiring pinpoint strikes, such as bridges and railroad yards, were hit by more precise weapons when weather conditions permitted, which was limited to 12 hours during the 12-day campaign.\nAs such practice in a highly interconnected battle arena demonstrates, cyber means and weapons should be used against adversaries while always considering their accuracy and range. When it would not be possible to precisely damage a cyber target that is interconnected with a civilian network, they should be used against military cyber networks, or at least those networks whose destruction does not have a significant impact on civilians. In this manner, a cyber mean can be designed to affect only a specific type of system, as it was in the Stuxnet incident, in which malware only affected the SCADA systems.\n.

The term refers to malware that is able to ‘recognize the environment it finds itself in and then execute itself only if the target system precisely matches that environment’. Recent events demonstrate that states follow this trend by using precise cyber means. At this point, the Russia-Ukraine War is of particular importance, and it should be carefully examined.\nIn the report prepared by Microsoft (the Microsoft Report), it is claimed that:\nRussian cyber tactics in the war have differed from those deployed in the NotPetya attack against Ukraine in 2017. That attack used ‘wormable’ destructive malware that could jump from one computer domain to another and hence cross borders into other countries. Russia has been careful in 2022 to confine destructive ‘wiper software’ to specific network domains inside Ukraine itself. But the recent and ongoing destructive attacks themselves have been sophisticated and more widespread than many reports recognize. And the Russian army is continuing to adapt these destructive attacks to changing war needs, including by coupling cyberattacks with the use of conventional weapons.\nThis passage raises two concerns. First, which types of cyber means are used? Second, excluding other considerations such as political or military ones, why did the Russians allegedly employ such means in an armed conflict while adhering to the LOAC?\nAs an answer to the first question, the Microsoft Report lists cyber means that were used or are in use in the Russia-Ukraine War:\n1. WhisperGate/WhisperKill\n2. FoxBlade, aka HermeticWiper\n3. DesertBlade\n4. CaddyWiper\n5. Lasainraw, aka IsaacWiper\n6. FiberLake, aka DoubleZero\n7. SonicVote, aka HermeticRansom\n8.

Even though the Microsoft Report does not give detail about number 5, another report states that it deletes data from physical and logical drives, though its impact is limited. Except for number 8, the effects\n. E Lawson and K Mačák, ‘Avoiding Civilian Harm from Military Cyber Operations during Armed Conflicts’ (ICRC Expert Meeting, 2020) 26.\n. Ibid.\n.

This brings an important issue to the surface. Even though the debate exists, operations causing such damage do not constitute attacks in terms of *lex lata*. Therefore, it would not be possible to apply Article 57 (2)(a)(ii) to those malwares since the rule encompasses means of warfare that are ‘used, designed, or intended to be used to conduct a cyber attack’. Then the question would be why Russia needs to employ such discriminatory cyber means.\nFrom the present author’s perspective, the war demonstrated that the key benefit of using cyber means in warfare is their adaptability, instead of previous assumptions that cyber operations provide a belligerent party an advantage owing to their low cost or non-attributability. As stated in the report, Russia adapted such means to ‘changing war needs’. This adaptation should be seen from two perspectives: cyber and kinetic. The former is important from a technical standpoint, and the latter is important from a legal standpoint, but both of them need to be examined because of their importance from a military standpoint.\nEven though it does not have a direct relationship with the legality of cyber means in terms of Article 57(2)(a)(ii), the technical standing point is important to understand why parties adopt cyber means in armed conflicts. Every new step in technology has the potential to threaten the kinetic weapon supremacy of an adversary. For example, the invention of a new type of surface-to-air missile system can erase the advantage of the adversary’s aircraft, and the attacking party needs to make a huge investment to improve its aircraft and produce new ones to establish a new squadron. On the other hand, the adaptability of cyber means makes it possible for past used malware to escape from such quick elimination. By adding some extra codes, a cyber weapon can be adjusted based on a new type of cyber security measure, and such modification can turn it into a new type of weapon. As stated by the ICRC, ‘it is possible for offensive cyber capabilities to be reverse-engineered or repurposed so that they can be reused. This is also the case for some traditional weapon systems, but the technical characteristics of cyberspace raise these concerns in a unique manner’. This uniqueness has been and continues to be demonstrated in the Russia-Ukraine War. Numerous reports claim that Russia used or is using malware by modifying previously used ones. In other words, cyber security updates also bring updates to those malwares, and they are adapted to changing needs in the cyber environment. For example, AcidRain, a wiper malware used to disrupt the VIASAT satellite, shares some characteristics with VPNFilter, a kind of malware used by Russia-backed cyber-organized groups in 2018. Also, such modifications do not have to take a long time. Shortly after the intrusion of WhisperGate into Ukrainian systems and its detection by cyber security companies, Russia altered it and developed a new type of malware, Hermeticwiper, that ‘has some similarities to the earlier WhisperGate’. This shows that detecting malware and taking defensive measures against it do not make such malware useless, but certain parts of the codes can still be used by belligerents to improve their cyber capabilities owing to their adaptability.\n.

Figure 1 above, depicted by Microsoft, shows how critical infrastructures are subject to cyber operations as the Russian tanks roll toward cities. Additionally, the fact that certain facilities, which are being physically attacked, were subject to cyber operations, demonstrates that the coordination is not general but rather as specific as possible. As a result, every operation that is part of an attack has to be evaluated within the meaning of the LOAC, and this necessitates evaluating the cyber means stated above to be employed by respecting relevant rules, including the principle of precautions.\nWhile choosing cyber methods, the first relevant factor is the timing of the attack to minimize collateral damage.[154] During World War II, Allied Forces conducted attacks on military factories at times when there were a minimum number of civilian workers present.[155] In that vein, for example, while carrying out cyber attacks against dual-use objects, the belligerent party may execute them at night or early in the morning when the targets are not intensively used by civilians.\n153.

If a target is located in a place that is mostly used by civilians and there is a significant level of risk of harm occurring, the attacker shall use the most accurate weapons available or must refrain from conducting such an attack. At this point, there is a discussion on whether the Internet can be held as a lawful target because, while it might make an effective contribution to the military capacity of the enemy, it is mostly used by civilians. Even though it is argued that if an attacking party believes that it can get enough military advantage, a cyber attack against the Internet is permissible, another opinion accepts the Internet as a civilian object and prohibits such an attack. According to the latter opinion, even if it is intended to carry out a cyber attack against the Internet, it should be limited to ‘individual networks, servers, routers, links, and other computer facilities that are used for military purposes and which are likely to be connected to the Internet’. By accepting the latter interpretation, the present author considers that if it is possible to considerably limit the effects of the attack, especially by considering the dual nature of cyberspace, then an attack may be conducted. If not, it will be in breach of the rule.\nWhilst some authors argue that the choice of means and methods only come onto the scene when there is a similar advantage, the present author thinks that the criteria should not be applied strictly. As stated by Borghard and Lonergan while discussing coercion in cyberspace, the attacking party tries to apply less harmful ways, such as disruptive operations rather than destructive ones, in order to better negotiate at later stages since the system may be restored more easily when the former type of means are used. At this point, the belligerent party should choose the type of means or methods to achieve the intended outcomes by considering the post-conflict situation. There is no doubt that a large number of civilian deaths will prolong the conflict, even if the attacks are perfectly legal. The bombing of Radio-Television of Serbia by NATO, which sparked so many debates about the legality of the campaign, may be an example of the adverse impact of such conduct. To Kolb, even if the station can be assumed as a military objective, it was repaired in three hours, and 16 civilians were killed because of the attack. By taking lessons from this example, it can be stated that belligerent parties should always consider alternatives, even if a designed cyber attack seems lawful. In such a case, disrupting broadcasting by cyber operation might produce better consequences, even though it seems that destruction promises more advantage. In these kinds of situations, perpetrators should always keep the humanitarian aims of the LOAC in mind.\n.

However, both of these provisions have similar meanings by prohibiting attacks conducted against a legitimate target if it seems that ‘excessive’ collateral damage will occur, whether the cyber attack is being planned or has already been planned. At this point, there should be a balance between military advantage and civilian harm.\n## 3.3.1 Military advantage\nThe advantage should be military in nature rather than merely moral, political or financial. For example, conducting cyber attacks against specific sectors of a country, such as the oil industry, which is vital for Arab countries, by considering that such an operation against ‘war-sustaining objects’ will decrease the military effort of an enemy is not appropriate since ‘almost every civilian activity might be construed by the enemy as indirectly sustaining the war effort’ as stated by Dinstein. Also, it is stated in the Official Commentary that this type of advantage can only be gained by the annihilation of an enemy or gaining ground; the transformation of the notion of war, however, changed this paradigm. While the former can be categorized as an overstatement, the latter seems to be an understatement. Hence, as a moderate approach, the HPCR Manual Commentary points out that ‘any consequence of an attack which directly enhances friendly military operations or hinders those of the enemy’ should be included within the ambit of military advantage.\nCyber attacks should be assessed as a whole while aiming to obtain military advantage. As stated by Fenrick and approved by declarations of numerous states, proportionality calculations cannot be made on either ‘a bullet-by-bullet basis’ or ‘the basis of attacks on individual military objectives’. Furthermore, when the army launches concerted or coordinated cyber attacks, it may be impossible or impractical for every\n. Boothby (fn 158) 125–27.\n. HPCR Manual Commentary 45.\n.

At this point, the planning stage has significant importance, and an attack should be judged by looking at the bigger picture. Although it was claimed that people who give an order will bear responsibility rather than those who execute the attack in such a case, if it is apparent that the targeted network is civilian in nature after the attack is initiated, it should be cancelled or a confirmation should be demanded by the perpetrator from higher ranks in light of changing circumstances. Lastly, assessing a cyber attack as a whole should not be interpreted as having a purpose to obtain military advantage by taking the ‘full context of a war strategy’ into account. Otherwise, all cyber attacks, whether they incur excessive civilian damages or not, can be deemed legal in defiance of the aims of the LOAC.\n## 3.3.2 Collateral damage\nCollateral damage can be described as an ‘incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians and damage to civilian objects or other protected objects or a combination thereof, caused by an attack on a lawful target’. At this point, collateral damage occurs while conducting cyber attacks against military targets without deliberately targeting civilians and civilian property.\nCollateral damage includes both the direct and indirect effects of a cyber attack. While the former type of effects are those that ‘are the immediate, first order consequence of a military action (weapons employment results, etc.), unaltered by intervening events or mechanisms’; the latter type of effects are ‘the delayed or displaced second-, third-, and higher-order consequences of action, created through intermediate events or mechanisms’. Since cyber operations are carried out at the logical layer of cyberspace, their first-order effects have an impact on data, programs, or software; nevertheless, such effects are not included in the aforementioned definition of collateral damage. Yet, ‘indirect effects may be aimed at the other layers of cyberspace, or at creating other higher-order effects in other domains’, and thereby such effects can raise the level of collateral damage. Therefore, the inclusion of indirect effects in the concept of collateral harm is crucial. However, due to the complexity involved in calculating second- or higher-order effects, such an inclusion also poses a significant challenge in cyberspace. As acknowledged in the Allied Doctrine:\nSince cyberspace is a global domain, there is a risk of COs [cyberspace operations] having an impact outside the joint operations area. COs can create undesired effects on our own\n. Quéguiner (fn 154) 804.\n. Ibid at 804–805.\n.

This risk, as with similar risks in other domains, is factored into the planning.\nEven though it is not necessary to make certain calculations, effects which are too remote or beyond the scope of reasonable certainty will not cause any responsibility for combatants. Lastly, collateral damage does not contain minor effects such as stress, irritation or inconvenience. All cyber attacks might cause stress or inconvenience to some extent, but that does not make them illegal.\n## 3.3.3 Excessive collateral damage\nBelligerent parties should always consider whether the expected military advantage is proportionate compared to the anticipated collateral damage. At this point, the terms ‘extensive’ and ‘excessive’ should be differentiated. In the Official Commentary, it was argued that conducting attacks against lawful targets should not create ‘extensive destruction of civilian objects’ despite the fact that there is no reference to such a limitation in the Additional Protocols. The collateral damage can be justified even if it is at the ‘extensive’ level on the condition that the nominated target is important enough. Although civilian casualties are ‘regrettable and tragic consequences of the war’, those losses do not ‘in themselves establish liability … under international law’ as stated by the Eritrea-Ethiopia Claims Commission.\nExcessiveness cannot be determined by approaching it as a mathematical formula, despite the fact that ‘[f]ifty civilians killed for one suspected combatant’ is given as a ‘textbook example of a violation of the proportionality principle’ by some authors. However, as stated in the NATO Bombing Report:\nIt is much easier to formulate the principle of proportionality in general terms than it is to apply it to a particular set of circumstances because the comparison is often between unlike quantities and values. One cannot easily assess the value of innocent human lives as opposed to capturing a particular military objective.\nHence, excessiveness should be evaluated depending upon the comparison between two values, namely, collateral damage and military advantage. Although it is hard to estimate excessiveness in cyberspace and to prevent it, there are methods to make a reasonable assessment. It is stated in the Allied Doctrine that:\nCOs [cyberspace operations] will be conducted according to the operation plan. As such, SCEPVA [Sovereign Cyber Effects Provided Voluntarily by Allies], when authorised, might give the commander alternative options to create effects. These options are integrated,\n.

At this point, the determination of the effects and excessiveness of an action will be based on the good faith of the combatant, its reasonableness and the circumstances in which the cyber attack is planned and executed.\n## 3.4 Effective warning\nIt is stated in Article 57(2)(c) of the AP-I that ‘effective advance warning shall be given of attacks which may affect the civilian population, unless circumstances do not permit’. The first appearance of this rule can be traced back to the Lieber Code, in which it was stated that:\nCommanders, whenever admissible, inform the enemy of their intention to bombard a place, so that the noncombatants, and especially the women and children, may be removed before the bombardment commences. But it is no infraction of the common law of war to omit thus to inform the enemy. Surprise may be a necessity.\nAs it can be observed from the article, if a party plans to conduct a surprise cyber attack, it does not need to give any warning so as not to endanger the success of the operation. Surprise may be necessary in some cases, such as when there is a risk of a pre-emptive cyber attack or the exposure of a broader campaign. The Tallinn Manual illustrates this by saying that:\nConsider, for example, a cyber operation involving placement of a kill-switch into the target computer’s control system, to be activated on the occurrence of some future event or after the passage of a specified period. A warning that would give the enemy an opportunity to locate and neutralise the device need not be given.\nTherefore, giving warning is limited to appropriate circumstances since an attacker may have special reasons that justify not giving any warning. A relevant consideration could be the equation comparing the level of military advantage between situations in which giving occurs and those in which it does not. If the gap justifies civilian harm, then the attacking party does not need to give a warning in advance.\nIf it is expected that the cyber attack will exclusively affect civilian objects and not have any impact on civilians, then giving warning will not be necessary. By approving this point, the Australian Military Manual states that the warning can be directed at civilians, who bear the dangers posed by an intended attack, or at responsible authorities. In that vein, if harm to civilians is expected, then they can be warned in many ways through\n. NATO (fn 59) 26 para 3.32 (explanations added).\n.

There is no necessity to issue a warning in a formal way. If it is effective, it can be conveyed by any means that are available to the attacking party, such as in a written or verbal way. Sending voice recordings or text messages through WhatsApp, for instance, might be a feasible precaution if it is deemed to be effective.\nThe term ‘effective’ is not clarified, neither in the AP-I nor in its commentary. Even though the Australian Military Manual suggests adopting ‘commonsense’ to achieve effectiveness, this does not clarify the notion but adds extra blurriness to it. On the other hand, the term ‘effective’ is defined in the dictionary as ‘producing a decided, decisive, or desired effect’. Based on this definition, it can at least be said that in order for a warning to be effective, it should aim to reduce collateral damage to a minimum. To accomplish this, the content of the warning should be reasonably clear and specific so that civilians have a chance to secure themselves from the effects of an attack. Both of these terms should be determined based on the context. In terms of clarity, rather than giving technical details, belligerent parties may underline the effects of cyber attacks and provide guidelines to civilians on how to protect themselves from such effects. In terms of specificity, there is no requirement to give a specific warning for every situation; the warning may be general in a way that provides a list of cyber objectives that might be targeted. Overall, there is no one correct method to issuing effective warnings, but they should be tailored to diverse scenarios to protect civilians.\nWarnings can be conducted through an enemy if it makes the warning more effective. However, such a warning can also be used as a ruse of war. For example, ‘a false announcement of a cyber attack affecting dual-use systems might prove militarily useful in causing the enemy to take its military assets off-line’. Nevertheless, if it is expected that such a warning causes civilians to ignore future real warnings and to put them in danger, then this will be prohibited. Further, the belligerent party should not give a warning in order to spread terror among civilians. As stated in Article 51(2) of the AP-I, ‘[a]cts or threats of violence the primary purpose of which is to spread terror among the civilian population are prohibited’. For this reason, warnings given through cyberspace that aim to ‘frighten or cause panic among residents or compel them to leave their homes for reasons other than their safety’ are forbidden. Although there is always a danger for civilians to be exposed to fake news via the Internet without the knowledge of the attacking party, it is also their obligation to search for the truth.\n194.

Therefore, this rule is also known as ‘the lesser of two evils’. The rationale behind the article is simple: While a commander is trying to get the maximum effect on the military capacity of the enemy, he/she should seek an option which has minimum effect on civilians. The example given in the Official Commentary is that ‘[i]nstead of attacking railway stations, which are usually located in towns, the railway lines were hit at crucial points, but away from inhabited areas; the same action was taken with respect to roads’. By analogy, it can be stated that cyber attacks should be conducted against specific networks of electricity distribution facilities rather than the whole power station. However, the rule comes into scene when two different options promise military advantage at the same level. Otherwise, the attack is subject to other provisions and principles, i.e., proportionality.\nThere are two critical discussions to have while inflicting the least amount of harm on civilians and civilian property. First, whether or not causing harm to civilians and civilian property is equally important. At this point, while discussing the Kosovo Conflict, General Clark states that ‘[w]e weren’t going to disregard risks to civilians but the alternative to taking risks with property damage was that we might ultimately have to put our troops in on the ground’. From this example, it seems that objects have less value than civilian lives in practice. However, cyber operations are more likely to have effects on objects than on people. Therefore, the relevant discussion may be whether all objects have the same value in cyberspace. At this point, Henderson offers to determine the value of objects by various factors such as ‘the “utility” of the object, the objects “replace-ability”, and the cost of replacement’. In that vein, in terms of utility, it may be preferable to have an impact on financial records rather than medical data in cyberspace. The second discussion is whether belligerent parties put civilians at greater risk than their own troops. Although some states and scholars adopt the opinion that the security of armed forces should be included in military advantage, another approach holds that the armed forces must accept the risks posed by combat actions, and those risks should not be borne by civilians. The present author considers that an attacking party who conducts cyber attacks against an enemy already minimizes the dangers of combat for its own troops because of their remoteness\n.

Therefore, it should not disregard civilian damage by claiming force protection.\nBeyond mere humanitarianism, it is a military reality to target legitimate objectives to the maximum extent while harming civilians to the minimum. Carnahan states that '[t]he wise military officer will try to concentrate firepower on key military objectives and to keep to a minimum the collateral damage not only for humanitarian reasons, but also because munitions that injure civilians are wasted munitions'.[214] When the humanitarian impacts of such 'wasted munitions' are considered along with their military value, it is a well-known fact that when civilian harm increases, the likelihood of success of the mission decreases, so belligerent parties should aim to put the least amount of risk on civilians if there is an opportunity to refrain from it while gaining a military advantage at the same level, or at least another option that significantly decreases the military advantage.[215]\n# 4 PRECAUTIONS AGAINST THE EFFECTS OF CYBER OPERATIONS\n## 4.1 General remarks\nIt is stated in Article 58 of the AP-I that:\nThe Parties to the conflict shall, to the maximum extent feasible:\n(a) without prejudice to Article 49 of the Fourth Convention, endeavour to remove the civilian population, individual civilians and civilian objects under their control from the vicinity of military objectives;\n(b) avoid locating military objectives within or near densely populated areas;\n(c) take the other necessary precautions to protect the civilian population, individual civilians and civilian objects under their control against the dangers resulting from military operations.\nThe rationale behind the article is to abstain from 'defensive tactics that unnecessarily increases civilian risk' by endangering civilians and civilian objects to the detrimental effects of military operations.[216] For this reason, belligerent parties should segregate their military objectives from civilians and civilian objectives; if this is not possible, they should at least protect these people and objects from the effects of cyber operations.[217]\nThe rule is applicable within the territory of the belligerent party, which is responsible for the protection of its nationals or people under its control.[218] However, this territorial application of the rule may pose a significant hurdle in cyberspace. Although it was claimed that 'all civilian cyber infrastructure and activities located in territory under the control of a party to the conflict are subject to this Rule', this approach cannot be applicable in cyberspace since it is almost impossible to control every civilian activity in this domain.[219] This follows a risk that a responsible government may claim\n214.

At this point, the term ‘control’ refutes such a defence by obligating the party to protect civilians and civilian property by segregating civilian computer systems if it has a capacity to control these systems. As a result, this obligation should not be applied by taking territorial concerns into account but rather by considering whether or not these systems are under the de facto control of a party.\nThese precautions are applicable as soon as they are ‘to the maximum extent feasible’. Although the term ‘feasible’ was explained in the first chapter, the Official Commentary further clarifies this term by noting that those measures should ‘not go beyond the point where the life of the population would become difficult or even impossible’. Also, the Tallinn Manual explains the term ‘maximum extent’ in a way that it ‘emphasises the importance of taking the requisite measures’. According to one approach, those measures can be applied depending upon ‘the requirements of national defence’ as stated in the declaration of Austria. From this perspective, parties do not need to expose all of their military facilities, or to put them in a more dangerous position by considering the dictations of the national defence. This is explained in Official Records by the delegation of the Republic of Korea with the following words:\n[T]his provision does not constitute a restriction on a State’s military installations on its own territory. We consider that military facilities necessary for a country’s national defence should be decided on the basis of the actual needs and other considerations of that particular country. An attempt to regulate a country’s requirements and the fulfilment of those requirements in this connexion would not conform to actualities.\nThis is a valid argument since, as described in the first chapter, the principle of precautions obligates parties to take measures when they are ‘practicable or practically possible’. For this reason, every country has to take precautions against the effects of cyber attacks within its own limits.\nWhile the term ‘constant care’ is not explicitly stated in the article, it is still a valid consideration which should be taken into account in order to alleviate risks to civilians and civilian property. At this point, Corn points three reasons why constant care should be taken in both active and passive precautions: First, there is no clear line between ‘attacking’ and ‘defending’ parties in terms of operational art since every armed force needs to conduct both types of operations in the conflict. Second, ‘constant care’ obliges all parties of an armed conflict to conduct their operations by taking civilian harm into account as well as seeking to gain military advantage. This obligation cannot be confined to the attacking party. Third, the exclusion of defending\n220. Jensen (fn 58) 214–15.\n221. Ibid.\n222.

When the nature of cyberspace is taken into account, the obligation becomes more important than conventional warfare since the domain has many more complexities than other areas.\nThese measures are similarly sampled in the ICRC Challenge Report and the Tallinn Manual while discussing feasible precautions against the effects of cyber attacks:\n[S]egregating military from civilian cyber infrastructure; segregating computer systems on which critical civilian infrastructure depends from the Internet; backing up important civilian data; making advance arrangements to ensure the timely repair of important computer systems; digitally recording important cultural or spiritual objects to facilitate reconstruction in the event of their destruction; and using anti-virus measures to protect civilian systems that might suffer damage or destruction during an attack on military cyber infrastructure.\nThis is not an exhaustive list, and every situation may require different precautions to be taken.\n## 4.2 The segregation of civilian networks\nAs it is indicated above, Article 58(a) of the AP-I requires parties to ‘endeavour to remove the civilian population, individual civilians and civilian objects under their control from the vicinity of military objectives’. The obligation should be applied when there is an immediate danger to civilians, and they should be evacuated them from the territory ‘where the risk of attack is greatest’. Even if this measure brings some difficulty to civilians, it aims to protect them from greater suffering, and alternative accommodations should be provided. If these measures are not achieved, this can be deemed forced displacement and a violation of international law.\nWhilst the rule seems applicable when traditional battlefield is taken into account, it still creates some problems. For example, the rule was opposed by Switzerland because of its geographical conditions, where most civilians live in valleys in which important military facilities are located due to the limited number of useful locations in the country, so it becomes very hard to segregate civilians and civilian objects from the proximity of these facilities. The same hardship is applicable for some facilities that can be important for both civilians and military personnel, such as air traffic control centres and power generation plants.\nOn the other hand, the application of the rule in cyberspace brings more difficulty than in traditional domains. Civilian infrastructures are used for almost all cyber operations, and most of them have a dual nature. As an example, how can civilians be removed from cloud technology, which is also used for military purposes? Nevertheless, it is argued in a legal assessment published by the US Department of Defence that ‘[w]here there is a choice … military systems should be kept separate from\n.

For example, parties to the conflict can build a separate cyber infrastructure in which only military communications travel through it, and locate dual-use cyber infrastructures separate from civilians. Although it can be claimed that situations may arise in which civilian and military networks cannot be segregated, state practice has started to follow a different pathway. It is stated by Walker that:\nIn cyberspace, State practice, particularly that of the United States, makes clear that it is feasible to separate purely military objectives from civilian objectives, at least up to a point. The United States military uses multiple, dedicated networks to conduct administrative, logistical and operational activities. The three best-known networks are the Non-Classified Internet Protocol Router Network (NIPRnet, which carries information classified up to and including Sensitive but Unclassified), Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRnet, which carries data classified up to and including the Secret level) and the Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communication System (JWICS carries data classified up to and including Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information).\nAs this example clearly shows, it is imperative to segregate the different types of networks, even if it can be costly. Otherwise, if the object makes an effective contribution and the segregation cannot be established, then the whole cyber infrastructure would be a lawful target.\nGovernmental and civilian data can be stored in the public cloud, despite the fact that this does not literally satisfy the criteria for segregation. However, the Russia-Ukraine War proved its usefulness in terms of reducing cyber dangers. The Ukrainian government moved an important part of the state’s digital infrastructure to the public cloud in preparation for Russian cyber operations against its governmental data center. In this sense, cloud technology turns the disadvantage of cyber infrastructure’s interconnectedness into an advantage. As a more advanced example, the Estonian government established a ‘data embassy’ whose ‘resources are under Estonian state control, secured against cyberattacks or crisis situations with KSI [Keyless Signature Infrastructure] Blockchain technology, and are capable not only providing data backups, but also operating the most critical services’. The particular advantage of such precautions compared with network segregation is that they protect civilian data not only from cyber attacks but also from other types of crises that might occur within states’ borders, such as natural disasters or kinetic attacks.\nIf such precautions impose a significant burden on the belligerent and are not feasible solutions, belligerent parties should search for other ways to shield civilian\n236.

The pertinent precaution could be the establishment of ‘digital safe havens’ through agreements between belligerent parties; while some systems may be difficult to negotiate due to their potential assistance to the adversary’s military effort, other systems critical to civilian life may be easily agreed upon.\n## 4.3 The location of military objectives\nIt is stated in Article 58(b) of the AP-I that belligerent parties should ‘avoid locating military objectives within or near densely populated areas’. From this perspective, parties to the conflict should refrain from locating both movable and immovable objects close to densely populated areas in order to protect civilians under their control. Nevertheless, the rule should not be limited to densely populated areas but also include ‘hospitals, cultural property, places of worship, prisoner of war camps, and other facilities which are entitled to specific protection’ by refraining from locating cyber military objectives in or around them.\nWhile the applicability of the rule is understood in a physical sense, and social media or other similar civilian websites ‘cannot be equated with densely populated areas’, the rule obliges parties to take measures by considering cyber infrastructures which are physically located in the territory of a party. Therefore, for instance, army cyber commands should not be located in places where civilians or special protected objects can be put in danger. However, there is a significant hurdle to locating defence ministries in a place which is not close to densely populated areas. On the other hand, it is still possible for parties to exclude these kinds of facilities, which are military in nature but almost impossible to locate in isolated places, from the ambit of the attack through negotiation. Even if they cannot be attacked, it is possible for a party to conduct disruptive cyber operations against cyber infrastructures in these facilities. At this point, cyber operations give a unique opportunity to parties not to harm civilians but to still have an impact on the military capacity of their enemies.\n## 4.4 Other passive measures\nAs it is stated above, belligerent parties should ‘take the other necessary precautions to protect the civilian population, individual civilians and civilian objects under their control against the dangers resulting from military operations’ according to Article 58(c) of the AP-I. While there is no limit on the scope of the rule, the Official Commentary states that this rule should be applied to civilians by providing them with protective shelters, as well as to specially protected objects by providing trained personnel to limit damage to them. However, conflicting parties should take all feasible precautions by taking the gap-filling function of Article 58(c) into account.\n. Tallinn Manual Rule 121 Cmt. para 10.\n.

However, there are some measures which are applicable to cyberspace by analogy. For example, civilians might be supported by providing them with software products such as anti-virus programs that limit the damage from cyber attacks, detecting civilian cyber systems in order to warn people in case of intrusion attempts, providing them technical assistance when their computer systems are harmed, providing a back-up system to store civilian data, blocking particular IP addresses which pose risks to civilian systems, and keeping ready a system that makes it possible to disconnect an entire country from the Internet when all measures are exhausted.\nWhile the title of Article 58 includes ‘attacks’, paragraph (c) clearly states that some precautions should be applied to operations. Although Jensen admits the ambiguity of this situation, he argues that countries which are not parties to the AP-I have responsibility arising from this provision for those acts that reach ‘attack’ threshold. In the Tallinn Manual, even though the majority of experts stated that the rule is applicable only to cyber attacks because of the title of the article and the non-existence of customary law, the minority focused on the wording of paragraph (c) by accepting cyber operations within the ambit of this rule. Therefore, the minority view kept the threshold lower, determined disruptive operations to be covered by this rule, and obligated parties to take precautions against the effects of these operations. However, both parties have a common understanding on the non-application of the rule to ‘mere inconvenience or irritation’.\nThere is no clear-cut answer on which precautions should be taken within the ambit of Article 58(c), since the provision serves as a gap-filler in the article. Despite the fact that it did not receive much attention in the past because the suitability of other provisions for kinetic activities made them more visible than paragraph (c), their relative unsuitability for cyber operations rendered this clause more important. At this point, the implementation of the norm in cyberspace has already begun to be shaped by the practices of both state and non-state actors, and this trend seems to be continuing and getting better. For example, the US government has begun to warn private entities when they are subjected to transborder cyber attacks and has provided them with cyber tools and training to combat those attacks. Furthermore, the Security Service of Ukraine informs civilians about cyber threats and what measures to take in order to avoid them. As a recent innovative example, the ICRC has been conducting research on creating a ‘digital emblem’ for the past two years in order to enable the identification of objects, systems, or networks that cannot be subject to cyber attacks. Lastly, even though these are individual precautionary measures, the Russia-Ukraine War has also demonstrated how state and non-state entities can collaborate to\n251.

The Microsoft Report highlights two examples of cyber security measures against Russian cyber activities:\nThe first has been the use of technology acquired from RiskIQ that identifies and maps organizational attack surfaces, including devices that are unpatched against known vulnerabilities and therefore are the most susceptible to attack. This information has been shared with the Ukrainian government free of charge to enable it to accelerate the strengthening of cyber-defenses. Ukrainian network defenders worked tirelessly with the constant support of the CERT UA within the government to use this information to protect computers across the country.\nThe second measure has been a wartime innovation pursued with the collaboration and support of the Ukrainian government. MSTIC recognized that Russian malware could be mitigated meaningfully by turning on a feature in Microsoft Defender called controlled folder access. This typically would require that IT administrators access devices across their organization, work made more difficult and potentially even dangerous in wartime conditions. The Ukrainian government therefore authorized Microsoft through special legal measures to act proactively and remotely to turn on this feature across devices throughout the government and across the country.\nEvery effort having a purpose to minimize collateral damage is desired in cyberspace; the principle of precaution essentially relies on the processes but not the results.\n# 5 CONCLUSION\nNew technologies have changed the nature of armed conflict significantly, and this process increasingly continues. As one kind of these technologies, cyber operations have introduced significant challenges to the LOAC, but the most unique one is their capability to have a wide range of effects because of the interconnectedness of cyberspace. This article has endeavoured to determine the application of the principle of precautions to cyber operations by tilting the principle towards humanity by considering the natures of both the principle and cyberspace.\nFrom the standpoint of the principle of precautions, the Russia-Ukraine War exemplified an important phenomenon: public-private cooperation against adversarial cyber operations. Unlike traditional domains, private entities have a partial but critical level of control over cyberspace, and as a result of this distinctive feature of the current conflicts, the Ukrainian government collaborated with a technology giant, Microsoft. This collaboration is emphasized in the Microsoft Report by stating that:\n[U]nlike the traditional threats of the past, cyber defenses rely on a unique level of public and private collaboration. The evolving threat landscape requires a whole-of-society approach. The private sector, particularly technology companies, are on the front lines of cyber and information attacks. Likewise, civil society organizations are key conveners that play a crucial role in engagement, sometimes are involved in cyber data analysis, and are often targets of these campaigns themselves.\nBringing non-public entities into the equation in cyberspace, thereby putting more civilians in the balance, would enhance the ‘civilianization’ of armed conflicts, and this would inherently lean the principle of precaution on the side of humanity.\n.

The interconnectivity problem should be approached from two perspectives, taking into account both the technical and the social factors. From the first standpoint, technical factors intensify the interconnectedness between military and civilian networks in cyberspace, therefore converting this domain into one of entirely dual-use nature and obstructing the distinction between military targets and civilian objects. As Jensen points out, ‘[w]ith 98% of day-to-day government communications routinely travelling over civilian communication lines, there will be many civilian lines of communication that will carry targetable electronic traffic intermixed with civilian traffic’.⁶ From this vantage point, not only is it highly difficult to make a certain distinction between civilian and military cyber infrastructures, but practically all military cyber activities must be carried out through dual-use cyber systems.⁷ In the absence of precautionary measures against such interconnectivity, the impacts of cyber activities might quickly spread to other systems across the globe and have the potential to significantly disrupt daily civilian life by having adverse impacts on civilian critical infrastructure and other associated systems.⁸ From this point of view, a cyber operation designed to disrupt a dual-used power plant located in a belligerent state could easily impair other systems, from water and food to ICT infrastructure, and its unintended effects might spill over into neutral countries.⁹ From the second point of view, interconnection becomes a more complicated matter when social factors are considered. Even though they are less obvious than technical ones, they still pose threats comparable to those of the latter, and it necessitates especially defensive parties to take unique precautionary measures.

In other words, ‘[t]he thrust is not absolute elimination of the calamities of war (a goal which would manifestly be utopian), but relief from the tribulations of war “as much as possible” bearing in mind that war is fought to be won’.²² At this point, it sounds rational that these two notions should be balanced while applying the principles governing the conduct of hostilities. On the other hand, considering the peculiarity of interconnectedness in cyberspace, this balance should be leaned toward humanity while applying the principle of precautions. There are some reasons in favour of such an interpretation. To begin with, the notion of ‘balance’ is significantly subjective.²³ From a practitioner perspective, when the armed conflict starts, reality does not permit such a compromise,²⁴ and the perception of ‘balance’ is determined by those on the battlefield. However, outside of the conflict, such a balance could be perceived differently by scholars or judges who need to evaluate the legality of such actions, and their views seem more ‘humanitarian’ to practitioners. As stated by Luban, ‘[f]or military lawyers, the starting point is military necessity, and the reigning assumption is that legal regulation of war must accommodate military necessity. For humanitarian lawyers, the starting point is human dignity and human rights’.²⁵ As a result, such disparities in viewpoints considerably alter the perception of balance, and trying to achieve a balance in the principle of precautions seems to be a rhetorical word. Apart from the subjectivity of balance depending on different perceptors, the nature of the LOAC principles inherently provides a lean toward either military necessity or humanity.²⁶ While the principles of distinction and proportionality are more eligible to more generally’. See A Sari and K Tinkler, ‘Collateral Damage and the Enemy’ (2019) British Yearbook of International Law 63. From the standpoint of this article, military necessity is held as a permission giving to a belligerent party in order to ‘apply any amount and kind of force to compel the complete submission of the enemy with the least possible expenditure of time, life, and money’ by not violating the LOAC. See The Hostage Case, Case No. 7 (United States v. Wilhelm List et al.), (Opinion and Judgment and Sentence) [1949] 1253 (‘The Hostage Case’). Pictet defines humanity as ‘a sentiment of active goodwill towards mankind’ by referring to Littré’s dictionary. See J Pictet, The Fundamental Principles of the Red Cross (1956) 143. By considering this definition, this article holds the principle of humanity as a ‘guiding principle that puts a brake on undertakings which might otherwise be justified by the principle of military necessity’.

The crux of the former principles is based on gaining military advantage on the battlefield,²⁷ and the notion of military advantage ‘has a particular resonance with “military necessity”’.²⁸ This naturally bends those principles’ interpretation in the direction of military necessity.²⁹ On the other hand, the central tenet of the principle of precautions is based on the minimization of civilian harm. It obliges belligerent parties to take active or passive precautionary measures to mitigate risks, which derive from military operations, towards civilians and civilian property in armed conflicts.³⁰ In line with this, it is not good enough for soldiers ‘merely not intending civilian harm’, but they also ‘must intend not to harm civilians’.³¹ Given that the nature of the principles requires that they be construed by leaning towards one side, analyzing the principle of precautions by considering the balance poses a risk that it turns into an ‘illusory rule’. According to Schwarzenberger: [Illusory rules]... are merely a formal compromise between the standard of civilization and the necessities of war. Here, in fact the rule of force is supreme. Rules which expressly proclaim the necessities of war as an overriding constituent element or are emasculated by an ‘as far as possible’ clause illustrate this perhaps slightly hypocritical variant of the rules of warfare.³² Thus, by turning the principle into an ‘illusory rule’, it would be very easy for belligerent parties to refrain from effectively applying the principle of precautions by putting terms such as ‘feasible’ or ‘unless circumstances do not permit’ on the table.³³ To preclude such excuses, one should hold it as a rule that ‘sets limitations to warfare in cases in which considerations of civilization demand priority over military interest’.³⁴ As correctly held by the Madagascar delegate, ‘[t]he article reflected a laudable desire to narrow the gap between the ideal and the possible, and to deal from a humanitarian standpoint with two opposite positions, namely, the aggressor’s and the victim’s’.³⁵ Per this point of view, the application of the principle of precautions by taking ‘one small step’ toward humanity could be ‘one giant leap’ toward a more appropriate ²⁷.

When the inherent bending of these principles toward military necessity and only their recognition as ‘principles’ in military manuals are considered, the consequence is admitted by Maurer that ‘[i]n more than one context, the balance between military “necessity” and protection concerns has heavily tilted towards military logics, and norms have been implicitly downgraded to mere discretionary guidance’.

In section 3, the precautions that shall be taken by the attacking side of the conflict according to Article 57 of Additional Protocol-I will be examined. In the first part of the section, target verification in cyber operations will be discussed, and some important questions will be answered, e.g., does technical superiority play any role on the precautionary level? Or what is the requisite level of certainty? In the second part, the choice of cyber means and methods will be addressed. The proportionality rule in precautions in planning and executing cyber attacks will be determined in the third part. Not only will key terms such as ‘military advantage’ and ‘incidental harm’ be discussed in that section, but also some grey areas, e.g., the consideration of indirect effects. The fourth part will explain effective warning before launching cyber attacks, and the final part will explain the least-danger rule. In the fourth section, precautions that shall be taken by a party that is subject to cyber operations will be addressed. In this chapter, the segregation of civilian and military objectives in cyberspace, the location of cyber military objectives, and other measures will be questioned, respectively. ## 2 THE REGULATION OF THE PRINCIPLE OF PRECAUTIONS, BASIC TERMS AND RESPONSIBILITY ### 2.1 The regulation of the principle of precautions While it is not stated conspicuously, the first implication of the principle of precautions can be found in Article 27 of the Hague Convention IV, in which it is stated that: In sieges and bombardments all necessary steps must be taken to spare, as far as possible, buildings dedicated to religion, art, science, or charitable purposes, historic monuments, hospitals, and places where the sick and wounded are collected, provided they are not being used at the time for military purposes.³⁷ In the following process, the prohibition to launch an attack against civilians and to spare them as much as possible found a place in various official documents.³⁸ However, the first binding regulation of the principle of precautions appeared in the AP-I, ³⁶. ‘The principles of distinction, precautions and proportionality thus complement each other in a way that achieves a subtle balance between military necessity and humanitarian imperatives.’ See Sari and Tinkler (fn 21) 4. ³⁷. International Conferences (The Hague), Hague Convention (IV) Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land and Its Annex: Regulations Concerning the Laws and Customs of War on Land, 18 October 1907. ³⁸. See League of Nations Res ‘Protection of Civilian Populations Against Bombing from the Air in Case of War’ (30 September 1938). Later, more detailed rules were articulated in Articles 8, 9 and 11 of the Draft Rules for the Limitation of the Dangers incurred by the Civilian Population in Time of War (1956). Despite the fact that states did not adopt these rules, they had an impact on the rules codified in Additional Protocols. See S Watts, ‘Law-of-War Precautions: A Cautionary Note’ in RTP Alcala and E Talbot Jensen (eds), The Impact of Emerging Technologies on the Law of Armed Conflict (Oxford University Press, 2019) 116. © 2023 The Author Journal compilation © 2023 Edward Elgar Publishing Ltd Downloaded from https://www.elgaronline.com/ at 07/16/2025 08:36:46PM via University College London (UCL) The Military Law and the Law of War Review, Vol. 61 No. 1 in which it is stated that both attacking and defending parties shall take precautions to spare civilians and civilian objects in an armed conflict. At this point, for *jus in bello* cyberspace operations, the principle of precautions provides a twofold protection: the first comprises taking constant care while conducting cyber attacks ('precautions in attack'), and the second comprises taking feasible precautions in order to protect civilians from the effects of cyber attacks ('precautions against the effects of attacks') during armed conflicts. These precautions can also be named 'active' and 'passive' precautions ruled under Articles 57 and 58 of the AP-I. The rules stated in Articles 57 and 58 are applied in times of armed conflicts, though the definition of 'armed conflict' is not provided in the Protocol. In this article, the definition given in the Tadic Decision, in which it was described as 'a resort to armed force between States or protracted armed violence between governmental authorities and organized armed groups or between such groups within a State',[39] is adopted. From this definition, it can be stated that there are two types of armed conflicts; 'between States' (international armed conflicts), and 'between governmental authorities and organized armed groups or between such groups' (non-international armed conflicts). In identifying the nature of the conflict, the status of the actors is the decisive factor.[40] The importance of this distinction is that while the AP-I, which is applicable to international armed conflicts, clearly states the obligation to take precautions, there is no clear provision which regulates the principle of precautions in Additional Protocol-II,[41] which is applicable to non-international armed conflicts. However, it does not prevent the application of the principle to the latter type of conflicts since it is stated in Article 13(1) of the AP-II that '[t]he civilian population and individual civilians shall enjoy general protection against the dangers arising from military operations'. Therefore, it is argued in the work of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) on Customary Rules that, by approving the customary nature of the principle for both international and non-international armed conflict, it is hard to abide by such a rule without taking any precaution.[42] Moreover, it is stated in the Tadic Decision that 'all necessary precautions should be taken to avoid injury, loss or damage to civilian populations' in all kinds of armed conflicts by referring to a resolution adopted by the United Nations General Assembly.[43] Finally, two recent treaties that are applicable to non-international armed conflicts explicitly regulate the principle of precautions.[44]",

To solve this problem, one should deem Article 57(4) as ‘merely a restatement of one of the existing rules’.⁴⁶ As Article 49(3) makes clear, the article does not affect those rules that are customary in nature and applicable to all types of military operations. Therefore, Article 57(4) does not contradict but rather ‘complement’ it.⁴⁷ Since the principle of precautions applies to both operations and attacks, both of these terms should be clarified. At this point, military operations are ‘any movements, manoeuvres and other activities whatsoever carried out by the armed forces with a view to combat’.⁴⁸ Therefore, all parties to the conflict should exercise constant care while conducting their military operations. For instance, if a tank driver harms civilian property while maneuvering the vehicle, he/she will be responsible due to the breach of the principle of precautions.⁴⁹ From this perspective, if a perpetrator destroys a civilian network while conducting cyber exploitation against either a civilian or military cyber system, he/she will bear responsibility. However, military attacks require a certain threshold since they are violent acts causing death, injury, damage, or destruction – or at least intending to do so.⁵⁰ As a result, all military attacks are kinds of military operations but vice versa would not be true. Therefore, while cyber operation can be defined as ‘the employment of cyber capabilities to achieve objectives in or through cyberspace’,⁵¹ cyber attack is ‘a cyber operation, whether offensive or defensive, that is reasonably expected to cause injury or death to persons or damage or destruction to objects’.⁵² In light of this, cyber attack is a special kind of cyber operation that results in violent effects. However, cyber attacks require a broader understanding because damage to objects may occur as a secondary effect of cyber operations. Therefore, the present author agrees with the approach of the majority of the International Group of Experts (the Experts), who prepared the Tallinn Manual, that cyber operations that result in the replacement of a component by having an impact on the functionality of an object fall within the ambit of attack because, while these kinds of operations do not damage an object in the first instance, their effects in later phases reach the threshold of attack by causing physical harm.⁵³ ⁴⁵.

At this point, the applicability of international law to cyber operations is recognized by states and international organizations.⁵⁵ Also, there is a certain difference between a cyber operation and an attack, and not all precautionary measures are applicable to all kinds of cyber operations. ## 2.2 Constant care According to Article 57(1) of the AP-I, the attacking party shall always take ‘constant care’ to spare civilians and civilian objects while conducting military operations. The term ‘constant care’ is clarified in the HPCR Manual Commentary by stating that ‘there are no exceptions from the duty to seek to spare the civilian population, civilians and civilian objects’.⁵⁶ Therefore, constant care obliges all levels of the armed forces who are responsible for planning, ordering or executing a cyber operation to always consider the results of it and try to minimize its effects on civilians.⁵⁷ The ‘constant care’ obligation is necessary for cyber operations. Those who are involved in the operation should always be aware of the foreseeable effects of operations on the civilian population and property and try to minimize these effects as much as possible. For this reason, it is not enough to demonstrate due care in the planning stage; this obligation extends to all stages of the operation in which civilians might be affected. In other words, these people should have ‘situational awareness at all times’.⁵⁸ The concept of situational awareness is explained in the Allied Joint Doctrine for Cyberspace Operations by describing it as ‘a combination of a near real-time updated RCP [Recognised Cyberspace Picture], analysis and information management’.⁵⁹ Although the obligation is constrained by the execution stage of an operation as described in the article, the effects of the attack can continue.

On the other hand, the application of the rule in cyberspace poses a significant hurdle since almost all cyber operations might affect or harm civilian cyber infrastructure to some extent.⁶² However, after all feasible precautions have been taken by an attacker, the relevant rule will be proportionality. If the effects of the operation on civilians are not excessive compared to the anticipated military advantage, then the attacking party may continue to carry out cyber operations. However, the calculation may be difficult because of the time-sensitivity. Planned operations give more chance to the attacking party to take better precautions, though time-sensitive ones generally do not permit sufficient time to implement more suitable precautions.⁶³ Although the impact of such a condition on precautions is not deniable, it does not give permission to the attacker to deviate from the principle because the constant care obligation necessitates parties to take feasible precautions in all circumstances.⁶⁴ The second significant hurdle might be the secretive nature of cyberspace since ambiguity is at the centre of cyber warfare.⁶⁵ Even though attribution may be difficult in that domain and the perpetrator of cyber acts that violate the LOAC cannot be easily found, parties to the conflict should obey the rules of the LOAC by considering warrior ethics. From this perspective, cyber warriors should always seek ways to mitigate risks towards civilians in good faith since ‘[r]espect for LOAC obligations is the essential touchstone for that ethical foundation’.⁶⁶ This ethical foundation serves for better protection of civilians, which is an inherent objective of the LOAC.⁶⁷ Last but not least, the ‘constant care’ obligation should not be accepted as limited to this article. It involves all phases of operations and attacks, which are carried out by both attacking and defending parties. For this reason, it has a guidance function while examining all provisions of Articles 57 and 58. ## 2.3 Feasibility Article 57 obliges parties to take ‘feasible’ precautions in order to minimize the effects of an attack on civilians and civilian objects. In the Official Commentary of Article 57, it is stated that those precautions are ‘everything that was practicable or practically possible, taking into account all the circumstances at the time of the attack, including ⁶⁰.

Parties to the conflict do not need to take 'perfect' precautions; it is enough to take precautions that are practically possible under circumstances ruling at the time.70 That is why feasibility should be determined on a contextual basis. At this point, every situation has its unique features, and those responsible for an attack should adapt various precautions by considering the characteristics of the situation. For example, an attacker party should map the target network through exploitation operations if it is connected to other civilian networks.71 In such situations, LOAC not only permits cyber espionage but also obligates a belligerent party to conduct these operations. However, such operations require a certain level of technical expertise, and in the absence of that, such a network should not be exploited.72 Despite such expertise, some mistakes may occur in the 'fog of war'.73 At this point, a commander who took 'all due measures' is not responsible for this harm.74 Those measures can be identified by different factors such as available cyber means, time sensitivity, the cyber defence system of the enemy, the characteristics of the target, intelligence assets, the expertise of the attacking team, the loyalty of the enemy of to the LOAC, and available assets and vulnerabilities of the enemy.75 However, even if feasible precautions are taken, unintended results may occur for various reasons, such as failure of the intelligence system, dysfunction of the technology, or unexpected changes in tactical conditions.76 For instance, a commander might prepare a map of a cyber network before conducting an attack, but the virus unintentionally spreads among the civilian infrastructure, which has a connection with the military network.77 At this point, while deciding on whether the principle of precautions is respected or not, one should not focus on outcomes, but compliance should be measured by the process in which an",

Therefore, it is permitted for the military commander in the Naval Manual of Ecuador to use alternative methods ‘in light of all the facts known or reasonably available to him, including the need to conserve resources and complete the mission successfully’.⁸¹ However, if it is understood that using less advanced weapons will result in excessive collateral damage, then they should either use advanced ones or cancel the attack.⁸² On the other hand, the determination of feasibility on a contextual basis should not be used to assuage the burden from the shoulders of the attacker. For example, the use of white phosphorus shells near al-Wafa hospital, where patients have serious injuries and need long-term care, by the Israeli armed forces was deemed a violation of Articles 57(2)(b) and (c) of the AP-I.⁸³ It was stated that those who were responsible for the attack should be aware of ‘all the facts and circumstances’.⁸⁴ For this reason, while conducting a cyber operation against a system in which some medical records may be located, the attacking party should take special care. The same is valid for facilities such as dams, where dangerous forces are located.⁸⁵ ## 2.4 Responsibility The wording of Article 57 restricts its applicability to ‘those who plan or decide upon an attack’. Because of this wording, some states have expressed reservations about Article 57, claiming that it only applies to ‘commanding officers at the battalion or group level and those of higher ranks’.⁸⁶ Nonetheless, every soldier who breaches obligations imposed by the LOAC bears individual criminal responsibility for his/her acts when such crimes are committed with ‘intent and knowledge’.⁸⁷ At this point, it does ⁷⁸.

The reason is that volumetric attacks can end up using all available channel capacity, which would affect the networks on the path to the target. This has happened in the past, with powerful DDoS attacks launched against specific targets and affecting entire internet infrastructure providers.⁹⁵ However, the unpredictability of effects does not relieve the responsibility of all levels of command while conducting operations. According to Watkin, operational factors cannot be put forward in order not to take feasible precautions in today’s trend, which pursues to compromise ‘human rights-like accountability frameworks with operational decision making during armed conflict’.⁹⁶ Accordingly, all members of the armed forces who are part of operations in cyberspace should do everything feasible within their limits. While assessing the individual responsibility of officers, they should be judged by how much they know about a certain subject.

For this reason, later evidence which showed that ‘the danger did not actually exist’$^{98}$ cannot be used to convict the commander since he ‘acted within the limits of honest judgment on the basis of the conditions prevailing at the time’.$^{99}$ This is crucial considering the interconnectivity of cyberspace since cyber attacks might affect civilian networks unexpectedly despite a commander’s employment of the advanced technology to conduct constant surveillance over a network.$^{100}$ At this point, the responsibility arising out of a cyber attack would not go beyond what the defendant knew at the time of the attack. On the other hand, one needs to distinguish misinformation from misconception. Misconception of the nature of the target might occur because of cognitive bias, which misdirects attackers by analyzing information ‘in a manner that supports their pre-existing beliefs or mental frameworks’.$^{101}$ States should employ a variety of techniques such as ‘training and education, red teaming procedures, specific positive identification (PID) policies for targeting, use of structured analytic techniques, and other analytic tradecraft practices’ in order for this not to result in civilian damage.$^{102}$ Despite the fact that states are keen to protect soldiers in such situations,$^{103}$ inflicting civilian harm due to biased decisions does not very well fit with the notion of ‘honest judgement’. Lastly, those who undertake cyber operations may be fully aware of the results of their actions owing to their technical expertise since cyberspace requires unique understanding compared to traditional domains. If a higher commander issues an order to launch a cyber operation without being aware of the outcomes in good faith, inferior commanders will be responsible for such intentional conduct. However, if a commander is aware that he lacks sufficient information about a target, he should either change the concept of the attack or refrain from issuing such an order.$^{104}$ Should an operation continue to be carried out while being aware of this insufficiency, responsibility arises. # 3 PRECAUTIONS IN ATTACK ## 3.1 Target verification It is stated in Article 57(2) of the AP-I that: (a) those who plan or decide upon an attack shall: (i) do everything feasible to verify that the objectives to be attacked are neither civilians nor civilian objects and are not subject to special protection but are military objectives within the",

The rationale behind this provision is to prevent carrying out attacks against objectives that are not military in nature because of misinformation or against military objectives in order to get a small military advantage by significantly harming civilians and objects.^[105]^ The binding definition of military objectives is codified in Article 52(2) of the AP-I, which states that: [M]ilitary objectives are limited to those objects which by their nature, location, purpose or use make an effective contribution to military action and whose total or partial destruction, capture or neutralization, in the circumstances ruling at the time, offers a definite military advantage. From this definition, there must be two cumulative elements ('two-pronged test')^[106]^ in order to deem an object as military, which are effective contribution and military advantage. For this reason, an object that is military in nature should not be subject to attack if it does not effectively contribute to the military capacity of an enemy.^[107]^ While only Article 52(2) of the AP-I has found its place in the provision, lawful targets also include people who can be made the object of direct cyber attacks. According to the LOAC, various categories of people can be held as lawful targets. The first one consists of combatants who are members of the armed forces and have a right to directly participate in hostilities.^[108]^ Even though they are lawful targets, they have a right to be treated as prisoners of war when they are captured by the enemy.^[109]^ The second category includes direct participants in hostilities. Although they are civilian in nature, they will be accepted as lawful targets if they meet three cumulative criteria which are: threshold of harm, direct causation and belligerent nexus.^[110]^ Those people are lawful targets 'for such time as they take a direct part in hostilities',^[111]^ and if they are captured, they cannot benefit from prisoner of war status. The third category, though there is a discussion on it, consists of members of an organized armed group that is a belligerent party in an armed conflict. They are 'individuals whose continuous function involves the preparation, execution, or command of acts or operations amounting to direct participation in hostilities'.^[112]^",

In the same vein, various authors claimed that conducting military operations without having a doubt on the nature of a target is not a reasonable expectation in the fog of war.¹¹⁸ From this perspective, there is always some doubt as an inherent characteristic of combat. On the other hand, the present author thinks that the Official Commentary should be interpreted as the aim of a commander. By stating the ‘slight doubt’ requirement, the commentary obligates them to take better precautions even if it is possible to erase this doubt. This is approved by military practice, in which attacks are cancelled when combatants are not ‘certain’¹¹⁹ or ‘100 percent sure of their aiming point’.¹²⁰ According to Parks, the US achieved this level of accuracy during the Linebacker II campaign by constantly confirming the nature of targets, implementing rules set by the Strategic Air Command, and issuing bomb damage assessments after each attack.¹²¹ Despite the fact that such high-level precautions sometimes pose substantial risks to the combatants’ lives, he acknowledges that they are important not only in terms of legality but also for achieving military and political objectives.¹²² By considering such positive outcomes, a commander should be sure enough that he/she made reasonable efforts to verify the nature of the target in cyberspace.¹²³",

At this point, cyber attack should be limited to that component, which is military in nature.¹²⁴ If it is not possible, then the attack should be cancelled. However, this should not be equated with being ‘perfectly familiar with the network’¹²⁵ since such an interpretation is not appropriate with the term ‘feasible’. ## 3.2 Choice of cyber means and methods After the nature of the target is verified, the next step will be to compose an operational plan that will have a minimum effect on civilians. At this point, it is stated in Article 57 (2)(a)(ii) of the AP-I that members of the armed forces should ‘take all feasible precautions in the choice of means and methods of attack with a view to avoiding, and in any event to minimising, incidental loss or civilian life, injury to civilians and damage to civilian objects’. This means that even if an attack is proportionate, parties to the conflict should be careful in their choice of means and methods in order to minimize the effects of attacks as much as possible while still aiming to obtain maximum military advantage. At this point, an attacking party should produce a plan that promises to give the most efficient operational and legal results.¹²⁶ It is important to define ‘cyber means’ and ‘methods’. Cyber means are defined as ‘cyber weapons and their associated cyber systems’¹²⁷ in the Tallinn Manual. At this point, cyber weapons are kinds of cyber means, but the latter includes a broader category. Cyber methods, on the other hand, are defined as ‘the cyber tactics, techniques, and procedures by which hostilities are conducted’.¹²⁸ Whilst cyber means are concerned with which tools should be employed to carry out cyber operations, cyber methods are concerned with how these operations should be carried out.¹²⁹ Based on this viewpoint, while botnets are a type of cyber means, the DDoS attack that is conducted by botnets can be considered a type of cyber method.¹³⁰ There is no weapon or method that is specifically prohibited in the provision. It only obliges parties to take feasible precautions by choosing appropriate means and methods; thereby, a commander will not be responsible for causing civilian harm. However, the rule does not require parties to choose means and methods that may decrease their expected military advantage.¹³¹ Even if alternative means and methods are not used because of this concern, a planned cyber attack must abide by other principles such as distinction and proportionality.¹³² On the other hand, if choosing different means and methods may change the degree of damage by producing ‘equivalent effects’ upon the target, then alternative means or methods shall be selected.¹³³ A facility where armed forces of a belligerent party conduct cyber attacks against the enemy, ¹²⁴.

However, this may result in civilian deaths who live in the vicinity of the facility. At this point, if an attacking party has available means to conduct a cyber attack, it shall use them against the system or computers in the facility to stop belligerent attacks. Additionally, military personnel’s expertise with those new technologies is crucial. The concern was raised in the Eritrea-Ethiopia Claims Commission. Even though Eritrea refused Ethiopia’s allegations that some of its aircraft intentionally attacked civilians, the inexperience of Eritrean pilots in using ‘computerized aiming systems’, which led to the failure to target military objectives, was held as a violation of Article 57 of the AP-I.¹³⁴ Lastly, a ‘target list’ can be prepared and constantly reviewed by belligerent parties in order to determine which type of weapon should be used to decrease civilian harm by considering the characteristics of the target.¹³⁵ For example, the bombardment of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) compound by the Israeli Armed Forces, which resulted in extensive damage and endangered the lives of many civilians, was accepted as reckless conduct and a violation of Article 57(2)(a)(ii) of the AP-I since it was executed while being aware of its importance for civilians.¹³⁶ However, in the Vietnam War, the US employed fragmentation bombs that had limited effects on the target to execute attacks against anti-aircraft batteries; since these batteries were located inside dikes, the army tried to refrain from damaging them.¹³⁷ The accuracy and range of weapons also have a particular importance in the execution of attacks.¹³⁸ If a target can be destroyed by accurate weapons, then it does not make sense to use dumb bombs or other means whose effects may not be calculated properly or limited. In this sense, the US practice in the Linebacker II campaign is important. During the campaign, the B-52s that have wide-range effects were employed because of weather conditions and the limited number of the more precise weapons.¹³⁹ But to keep the collateral damage to a minimum, the B-52s were used against targets that were either sufficiently large or in military-industrial complexes.¹⁴⁰ Other objectives requiring pinpoint strikes, such as bridges and railroad yards, were hit by more precise weapons when weather conditions permitted, which was limited to 12 hours during the 12-day campaign.¹⁴¹ As such practice in a highly interconnected battle arena demonstrates, cyber means and weapons should be used against adversaries while always considering their accuracy and range. When it would not be possible to precisely damage a cyber target that is interconnected with a civilian network, they should be used against military cyber networks, or at least those networks whose destruction does not have a significant impact on civilians. In this manner, a cyber mean can be designed to affect only a specific type of system, as it was in the Stuxnet incident, in which malware only affected the SCADA systems. ¹³⁴.

In the report prepared by Microsoft (the Microsoft Report), it is claimed that: Russian cyber tactics in the war have differed from those deployed in the NotPetya attack against Ukraine in 2017. That attack used ‘wormable’ destructive malware that could jump from one computer domain to another and hence cross borders into other countries. Russia has been careful in 2022 to confine destructive ‘wiper software’ to specific network domains inside Ukraine itself. But the recent and ongoing destructive attacks themselves have been sophisticated and more widespread than many reports recognize. And the Russian army is continuing to adapt these destructive attacks to changing war needs, including by coupling cyberattacks with the use of conventional weapons.¹⁴⁵ This passage raises two concerns. First, which types of cyber means are used? Second, excluding other considerations such as political or military ones, why did the Russians allegedly employ such means in an armed conflict while adhering to the LOAC? As an answer to the first question, the Microsoft Report lists cyber means that were used or are in use in the Russia-Ukraine War:",

If a target is located in a place that is mostly used by civilians and there is a significant level of risk of harm occurring, the attacker shall use the most accurate weapons available or must refrain from conducting such an attack.¹⁵⁶ At this point, there is a discussion on whether the Internet can be held as a lawful target because, while it might make an effective contribution to the military capacity of the enemy, it is mostly used by civilians. Even though it is argued that if an attacking party believes that it can get enough military advantage, a cyber attack against the Internet is permissible,¹⁵⁷ another opinion accepts the Internet as a civilian object and prohibits such an attack.¹⁵⁸ According to the latter opinion, even if it is intended to carry out a cyber attack against the Internet, it should be limited to ‘individual networks, servers, routers, links, and other computer facilities that are used for military purposes and which are likely to be connected to the Internet’.¹⁵⁹ By accepting the latter interpretation, the present author considers that if it is possible to considerably limit the effects of the attack, especially by considering the dual nature of cyberspace, then an attack may be conducted. If not, it will be in breach of the rule. Whilst some authors argue that the choice of means and methods only come onto the scene when there is a similar advantage,¹⁶⁰ the present author thinks that the criteria should not be applied strictly. As stated by Borghard and Lonergan while discussing coercion in cyberspace, the attacking party tries to apply less harmful ways, such as disruptive operations rather than destructive ones, in order to better negotiate at later stages since the system may be restored more easily when the former type of means are used.¹⁶¹ At this point, the belligerent party should choose the type of means or methods to achieve the intended outcomes by considering the post-conflict situation.¹⁶² There is no doubt that a large number of civilian deaths will prolong the conflict, even if the attacks are perfectly legal. The bombing of Radio-Television of Serbia by NATO, which sparked so many debates about the legality of the campaign, may be an example of the adverse impact of such conduct. To Kolb, even if the station can be assumed as a military objective, it was repaired in three hours, and 16 civilians were killed because of the attack.¹⁶³ By taking lessons from this example, it can be stated that belligerent parties should always consider alternatives, even if a designed cyber attack seems lawful. In such a case, disrupting broadcasting by cyber operation might produce better consequences, even though it seems that destruction promises more advantage. In these kinds of situations, perpetrators should always keep the humanitarian aims of the LOAC in mind. ¹⁵⁶.

While the former provision comes into scene at the planning level, the latter concerns the execution stage. However, both of these provisions have similar meanings by prohibiting attacks conducted against a legitimate target if it seems that ‘excessive’ collateral damage will occur, whether the cyber attack is being planned or has already been planned.¹⁶⁴ At this point, there should be a balance between military advantage and civilian harm. ## 3.3.1 Military advantage The advantage should be military in nature rather than merely moral, political or financial.¹⁶⁵ For example, conducting cyber attacks against specific sectors of a country, such as the oil industry, which is vital for Arab countries, by considering that such an operation against ‘war-sustaining objects’ will decrease the military effort of an enemy is not appropriate since ‘almost every civilian activity might be construed by the enemy as indirectly sustaining the war effort’ as stated by Dinstein.¹⁶⁶ Also, it is stated in the Official Commentary that this type of advantage can only be gained by the annihilation of an enemy or gaining ground; the transformation of the notion of war, however, changed this paradigm.¹⁶⁷ While the former can be categorized as an overstatement, the latter seems to be an understatement. Hence, as a moderate approach, the HPCR Manual Commentary points out that ‘any consequence of an attack which directly enhances friendly military operations or hinders those of the enemy’¹⁶⁸ should be included within the ambit of military advantage. Cyber attacks should be assessed as a whole while aiming to obtain military advantage.¹⁶⁹ As stated by Fenrick and approved by declarations of numerous states, proportionality calculations cannot be made on either ‘a bullet-by-bullet basis’ or ‘the basis of attacks on individual military objectives’.¹⁷⁰ Furthermore, when the army launches concerted or coordinated cyber attacks, it may be impossible or impractical for every ¹⁶⁴.

Although it was claimed that people who give an order will bear responsibility rather than those who execute the attack in such a case, if it is apparent that the targeted network is civilian in nature after the attack is initiated, it should be cancelled or a confirmation should be demanded by the perpetrator from higher ranks in light of changing circumstances.¹⁷² Lastly, assessing a cyber attack as a whole should not be interpreted as having a purpose to obtain military advantage by taking the ‘full context of a war strategy’ into account.¹⁷³ Otherwise, all cyber attacks, whether they incur excessive civilian damages or not, can be deemed legal in defiance of the aims of the LOAC. ## 3.3.2 Collateral damage Collateral damage can be described as an ‘incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians and damage to civilian objects or other protected objects or a combination thereof, caused by an attack on a lawful target’.¹⁷⁴ At this point, collateral damage occurs while conducting cyber attacks against military targets without deliberately targeting civilians and civilian property. Collateral damage includes both the direct and indirect effects of a cyber attack. While the former type of effects are those that ‘are the immediate, first order consequence of a military action (weapons employment results, etc.), unaltered by intervening events or mechanisms’;¹⁷⁵ the latter type of effects are ‘the delayed or displaced second-, third-, and higher-order consequences of action, created through intermediate events or mechanisms’.¹⁷⁶ Since cyber operations are carried out at the logical layer of cyberspace, their first-order effects have an impact on data, programs, or software; nevertheless, such effects are not included in the aforementioned definition of collateral damage.¹⁷⁷ Yet, ‘indirect effects may be aimed at the other layers of cyberspace, or at creating other higher-order effects in other domains’, and thereby such effects can raise the level of collateral damage.¹⁷⁸ Therefore, the inclusion of indirect effects in the concept of collateral harm is crucial. However, due to the complexity involved in calculating second- or higher-order effects, such an inclusion also poses a significant challenge in cyberspace. As acknowledged in the Allied Doctrine: Since cyberspace is a global domain, there is a risk of COs [cyberspace operations] having an impact outside the joint operations area. COs can create undesired effects on our own ¹⁷¹. Quéguiner (fn 154) 804. ¹⁷². Ibid at 804–805. ¹⁷³.

This risk, as with similar risks in other domains, is factored into the planning.¹⁷⁹ Even though it is not necessary to make certain calculations, effects which are too remote or beyond the scope of reasonable certainty will not cause any responsibility for combatants.¹⁸⁰ Lastly, collateral damage does not contain minor effects such as stress, irritation or inconvenience.¹⁸¹ All cyber attacks might cause stress or inconvenience to some extent, but that does not make them illegal. ## 3.3.3 Excessive collateral damage Belligerent parties should always consider whether the expected military advantage is proportionate compared to the anticipated collateral damage. At this point, the terms ‘extensive’ and ‘excessive’ should be differentiated. In the Official Commentary, it was argued that conducting attacks against lawful targets should not create ‘extensive destruction of civilian objects’¹⁸² despite the fact that there is no reference to such a limitation in the Additional Protocols. The collateral damage can be justified even if it is at the ‘extensive’ level on the condition that the nominated target is important enough. Although civilian casualties are ‘regrettable and tragic consequences of the war’, those losses do not ‘in themselves establish liability … under international law’ as stated by the Eritrea-Ethiopia Claims Commission.¹⁸³ Excessiveness cannot be determined by approaching it as a mathematical formula, despite the fact that ‘[f]ifty civilians killed for one suspected combatant’ is given as a ‘textbook example of a violation of the proportionality principle’ by some authors.¹⁸⁴ However, as stated in the NATO Bombing Report: It is much easier to formulate the principle of proportionality in general terms than it is to apply it to a particular set of circumstances because the comparison is often between unlike quantities and values. One cannot easily assess the value of innocent human lives as opposed to capturing a particular military objective.¹⁸⁵ Hence, excessiveness should be evaluated depending upon the comparison between two values, namely, collateral damage and military advantage. Although it is hard to estimate excessiveness in cyberspace and to prevent it, there are methods to make a reasonable assessment. It is stated in the Allied Doctrine that: COs [cyberspace operations] will be conducted according to the operation plan. As such, SCEPVA [Sovereign Cyber Effects Provided Voluntarily by Allies], when authorised, might give the commander alternative options to create effects. These options are integrated, ¹⁷⁹.

At this point, the determination of the effects and excessiveness of an action will be based on the good faith of the combatant, its reasonableness and the circumstances in which the cyber attack is planned and executed. ## 3.4 Effective warning It is stated in Article 57(2)(c) of the AP-I that ‘effective advance warning shall be given of attacks which may affect the civilian population, unless circumstances do not permit’. The first appearance of this rule can be traced back to the Lieber Code, in which it was stated that: Commanders, whenever admissible, inform the enemy of their intention to bombard a place, so that the noncombatants, and especially the women and children, may be removed before the bombardment commences. But it is no infraction of the common law of war to omit thus to inform the enemy. Surprise may be a necessity.¹⁸⁷ As it can be observed from the article, if a party plans to conduct a surprise cyber attack, it does not need to give any warning so as not to endanger the success of the operation.¹⁸⁸ Surprise may be necessary in some cases, such as when there is a risk of a pre-emptive cyber attack or the exposure of a broader campaign.¹⁸⁹ The Tallinn Manual illustrates this by saying that: Consider, for example, a cyber operation involving placement of a kill-switch into the target computer’s control system, to be activated on the occurrence of some future event or after the passage of a specified period. A warning that would give the enemy an opportunity to locate and neutralise the device need not be given.¹⁹⁰ Therefore, giving warning is limited to appropriate circumstances since an attacker may have special reasons that justify not giving any warning.¹⁹¹ A relevant consideration could be the equation comparing the level of military advantage between situations in which giving occurs and those in which it does not. If the gap justifies civilian harm, then the attacking party does not need to give a warning in advance. If it is expected that the cyber attack will exclusively affect civilian objects and not have any impact on civilians, then giving warning will not be necessary.¹⁹² By approving this point, the Australian Military Manual states that the warning can be directed at civilians, who bear the dangers posed by an intended attack, or at responsible authorities.¹⁹³ In that vein, if harm to civilians is expected, then they can be warned in many ways through ¹⁸⁶.

The term ‘effective’ is not clarified, neither in the AP-I nor in its commentary. Even though the Australian Military Manual suggests adopting ‘commonsense’ to achieve effectiveness, this does not clarify the notion but adds extra blurriness to it.¹⁹⁷ On the other hand, the term ‘effective’ is defined in the dictionary as ‘producing a decided, decisive, or desired effect’.¹⁹⁸ Based on this definition, it can at least be said that in order for a warning to be effective, it should aim to reduce collateral damage to a minimum. To accomplish this, the content of the warning should be reasonably clear and specific so that civilians have a chance to secure themselves from the effects of an attack.¹⁹⁹ Both of these terms should be determined based on the context. In terms of clarity, rather than giving technical details, belligerent parties may underline the effects of cyber attacks and provide guidelines to civilians on how to protect themselves from such effects. In terms of specificity, there is no requirement to give a specific warning for every situation; the warning may be general in a way that provides a list of cyber objectives that might be targeted.²⁰⁰ Overall, there is no one correct method to issuing effective warnings, but they should be tailored to diverse scenarios to protect civilians. Warnings can be conducted through an enemy if it makes the warning more effective.²⁰¹ However, such a warning can also be used as a ruse of war. For example, ‘a false announcement of a cyber attack affecting dual-use systems might prove militarily useful in causing the enemy to take its military assets off-line’.²⁰² Nevertheless, if it is expected that such a warning causes civilians to ignore future real warnings and to put them in danger, then this will be prohibited.²⁰³ Further, the belligerent party should not give a warning in order to spread terror among civilians.²⁰⁴ As stated in Article 51(2) of the AP-I, ‘[a]cts or threats of violence the primary purpose of which is to spread terror among the civilian population are prohibited’. For this reason, warnings given through cyberspace that aim to ‘frighten or cause panic among residents or compel them to leave their homes for reasons other than their safety’ are forbidden.²⁰⁵ Although there is always a danger for civilians to be exposed to fake news via the Internet without the knowledge of the attacking party, it is also their obligation to search for the truth.",

From the perspective of this article, if a commander has more than one option, then the rule can be applicable. Therefore, this rule is also known as ‘the lesser of two evils’.²⁰⁶ The rationale behind the article is simple: While a commander is trying to get the maximum effect on the military capacity of the enemy, he/she should seek an option which has minimum effect on civilians. The example given in the Official Commentary is that ‘[i]nstead of attacking railway stations, which are usually located in towns, the railway lines were hit at crucial points, but away from inhabited areas; the same action was taken with respect to roads’.²⁰⁷ By analogy, it can be stated that cyber attacks should be conducted against specific networks of electricity distribution facilities rather than the whole power station.²⁰⁸ However, the rule comes into scene when two different options promise military advantage at the same level.²⁰⁹ Otherwise, the attack is subject to other provisions and principles, i.e., proportionality. There are two critical discussions to have while inflicting the least amount of harm on civilians and civilian property. First, whether or not causing harm to civilians and civilian property is equally important. At this point, while discussing the Kosovo Conflict, General Clark states that ‘[w]e weren’t going to disregard risks to civilians but the alternative to taking risks with property damage was that we might ultimately have to put our troops in on the ground’.²¹⁰ From this example, it seems that objects have less value than civilian lives in practice. However, cyber operations are more likely to have effects on objects than on people. Therefore, the relevant discussion may be whether all objects have the same value in cyberspace. At this point, Henderson offers to determine the value of objects by various factors such as ‘the “utility” of the object, the objects “replace-ability”, and the cost of replacement’.²¹¹ In that vein, in terms of utility, it may be preferable to have an impact on financial records rather than medical data in cyberspace. The second discussion is whether belligerent parties put civilians at greater risk than their own troops. Although some states and scholars adopt the opinion that the security of armed forces should be included in military advantage,²¹² another approach holds that the armed forces must accept the risks posed by combat actions, and those risks should not be borne by civilians.²¹³ The present author considers that an attacking party who conducts cyber attacks against an enemy already minimizes the dangers of combat for its own troops because of their remoteness ²⁰⁶.

Therefore, it should not disregard civilian damage by claiming force protection. Beyond mere humanitarianism, it is a military reality to target legitimate objectives to the maximum extent while harming civilians to the minimum. Carnahan states that '[t]he wise military officer will try to concentrate firepower on key military objectives and to keep to a minimum the collateral damage not only for humanitarian reasons, but also because munitions that injure civilians are wasted munitions'.[214] When the humanitarian impacts of such 'wasted munitions' are considered along with their military value, it is a well-known fact that when civilian harm increases, the likelihood of success of the mission decreases, so belligerent parties should aim to put the least amount of risk on civilians if there is an opportunity to refrain from it while gaining a military advantage at the same level, or at least another option that significantly decreases the military advantage.[215] # 4 PRECAUTIONS AGAINST THE EFFECTS OF CYBER OPERATIONS ## 4.1 General remarks It is stated in Article 58 of the AP-I that: The Parties to the conflict shall, to the maximum extent feasible: (a) without prejudice to Article 49 of the Fourth Convention, endeavour to remove the civilian population, individual civilians and civilian objects under their control from the vicinity of military objectives; (b) avoid locating military objectives within or near densely populated areas; (c) take the other necessary precautions to protect the civilian population, individual civilians and civilian objects under their control against the dangers resulting from military operations. The rationale behind the article is to abstain from 'defensive tactics that unnecessarily increases civilian risk' by endangering civilians and civilian objects to the detrimental effects of military operations.[216] For this reason, belligerent parties should segregate their military objectives from civilians and civilian objectives; if this is not possible, they should at least protect these people and objects from the effects of cyber operations.[217] The rule is applicable within the territory of the belligerent party, which is responsible for the protection of its nationals or people under its control.[218] However, this territorial application of the rule may pose a significant hurdle in cyberspace. Although it was claimed that 'all civilian cyber infrastructure and activities located in territory under the control of a party to the conflict are subject to this Rule', this approach cannot be applicable in cyberspace since it is almost impossible to control every civilian activity in this domain.[219] This follows a risk that a responsible government may claim",

These precautions are applicable as soon as they are ‘to the maximum extent feasible’. Although the term ‘feasible’ was explained in the first chapter, the Official Commentary further clarifies this term by noting that those measures should ‘not go beyond the point where the life of the population would become difficult or even impossible’.²²² Also, the Tallinn Manual explains the term ‘maximum extent’ in a way that it ‘emphasises the importance of taking the requisite measures’.²²³ According to one approach, those measures can be applied depending upon ‘the requirements of national defence’ as stated in the declaration of Austria.²²⁴ From this perspective, parties do not need to expose all of their military facilities, or to put them in a more dangerous position by considering the dictations of the national defence.²²⁵ This is explained in Official Records by the delegation of the Republic of Korea with the following words: [T]his provision does not constitute a restriction on a State’s military installations on its own territory. We consider that military facilities necessary for a country’s national defence should be decided on the basis of the actual needs and other considerations of that particular country. An attempt to regulate a country’s requirements and the fulfilment of those requirements in this connexion would not conform to actualities.²²⁶ This is a valid argument since, as described in the first chapter, the principle of precautions obligates parties to take measures when they are ‘practicable or practically possible’. For this reason, every country has to take precautions against the effects of cyber attacks within its own limits. While the term ‘constant care’ is not explicitly stated in the article, it is still a valid consideration which should be taken into account in order to alleviate risks to civilians and civilian property.²²⁷ At this point, Corn points three reasons why constant care should be taken in both active and passive precautions:²²⁸ First, there is no clear line between ‘attacking’ and ‘defending’ parties in terms of operational art since every armed force needs to conduct both types of operations in the conflict. Second, ‘constant care’ obliges all parties of an armed conflict to conduct their operations by taking civilian harm into account as well as seeking to gain military advantage. This obligation cannot be confined to the attacking party. Third, the exclusion of defending",

When the nature of cyberspace is taken into account, the obligation becomes more important than conventional warfare since the domain has many more complexities than other areas. These measures are similarly sampled in the ICRC Challenge Report and the Tallinn Manual while discussing feasible precautions against the effects of cyber attacks: [S]egregating military from civilian cyber infrastructure; segregating computer systems on which critical civilian infrastructure depends from the Internet; backing up important civilian data; making advance arrangements to ensure the timely repair of important computer systems; digitally recording important cultural or spiritual objects to facilitate reconstruction in the event of their destruction; and using anti-virus measures to protect civilian systems that might suffer damage or destruction during an attack on military cyber infrastructure.²²⁹ This is not an exhaustive list, and every situation may require different precautions to be taken. ## 4.2 The segregation of civilian networks As it is indicated above, Article 58(a) of the AP-I requires parties to ‘endeavour to remove the civilian population, individual civilians and civilian objects under their control from the vicinity of military objectives’. The obligation should be applied when there is an immediate danger to civilians, and they should be evacuated them from the territory ‘where the risk of attack is greatest’.²³⁰ Even if this measure brings some difficulty to civilians, it aims to protect them from greater suffering, and alternative accommodations should be provided.²³¹ If these measures are not achieved, this can be deemed forced displacement and a violation of international law. Whilst the rule seems applicable when traditional battlefield is taken into account, it still creates some problems. For example, the rule was opposed by Switzerland because of its geographical conditions, where most civilians live in valleys in which important military facilities are located due to the limited number of useful locations in the country, so it becomes very hard to segregate civilians and civilian objects from the proximity of these facilities.²³² The same hardship is applicable for some facilities that can be important for both civilians and military personnel, such as air traffic control centres and power generation plants.²³³ On the other hand, the application of the rule in cyberspace brings more difficulty than in traditional domains. Civilian infrastructures are used for almost all cyber operations, and most of them have a dual nature.²³⁴ As an example, how can civilians be removed from cloud technology, which is also used for military purposes?²³⁵ Nevertheless, it is argued in a legal assessment published by the US Department of Defence that ‘[w]here there is a choice … military systems should be kept separate from ²²⁹.

The United States military uses multiple, dedicated networks to conduct administrative, logistical and operational activities. The three best-known networks are the Non-Classified Internet Protocol Router Network (NIPRnet, which carries information classified up to and including Sensitive but Unclassified), Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRnet, which carries data classified up to and including the Secret level) and the Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communication System (JWICS carries data classified up to and including Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information).²³⁹ As this example clearly shows, it is imperative to segregate the different types of networks, even if it can be costly.²⁴⁰ Otherwise, if the object makes an effective contribution and the segregation cannot be established, then the whole cyber infrastructure would be a lawful target.²⁴¹ Governmental and civilian data can be stored in the public cloud, despite the fact that this does not literally satisfy the criteria for segregation. However, the Russia-Ukraine War proved its usefulness in terms of reducing cyber dangers. The Ukrainian government moved an important part of the state’s digital infrastructure to the public cloud in preparation for Russian cyber operations against its governmental data center.²⁴² In this sense, cloud technology turns the disadvantage of cyber infrastructure’s interconnectedness into an advantage. As a more advanced example, the Estonian government established a ‘data embassy’ whose ‘resources are under Estonian state control, secured against cyberattacks or crisis situations with KSI [Keyless Signature Infrastructure] Blockchain technology, and are capable not only providing data backups, but also operating the most critical services’.²⁴³ The particular advantage of such precautions compared with network segregation is that they protect civilian data not only from cyber attacks but also from other types of crises that might occur within states’ borders, such as natural disasters or kinetic attacks.²⁴⁴ If such precautions impose a significant burden on the belligerent and are not feasible solutions, belligerent parties should search for other ways to shield civilian",

From this perspective, parties to the conflict should refrain from locating both movable and immovable objects close to densely populated areas in order to protect civilians under their control.²⁴⁷ Nevertheless, the rule should not be limited to densely populated areas but also include ‘hospitals, cultural property, places of worship, prisoner of war camps, and other facilities which are entitled to specific protection’²⁴⁸ by refraining from locating cyber military objectives in or around them. While the applicability of the rule is understood in a physical sense, and social media or other similar civilian websites ‘cannot be equated with densely populated areas’, the rule obliges parties to take measures by considering cyber infrastructures which are physically located in the territory of a party.²⁴⁹ Therefore, for instance, army cyber commands should not be located in places where civilians or special protected objects can be put in danger. However, there is a significant hurdle to locating defence ministries in a place which is not close to densely populated areas. On the other hand, it is still possible for parties to exclude these kinds of facilities, which are military in nature but almost impossible to locate in isolated places, from the ambit of the attack through negotiation. Even if they cannot be attacked, it is possible for a party to conduct disruptive cyber operations against cyber infrastructures in these facilities. At this point, cyber operations give a unique opportunity to parties not to harm civilians but to still have an impact on the military capacity of their enemies. ## 4.4 Other passive measures As it is stated above, belligerent parties should ‘take the other necessary precautions to protect the civilian population, individual civilians and civilian objects under their control against the dangers resulting from military operations’ according to Article 58(c) of the AP-I. While there is no limit on the scope of the rule, the Official Commentary states that this rule should be applied to civilians by providing them with protective shelters, as well as to specially protected objects by providing trained personnel to limit damage to them.²⁵⁰ However, conflicting parties should take all feasible precautions by taking the gap-filling function of Article 58(c) into account. ²⁴⁵.

For example, civilians might be supported by providing them with software products such as anti-virus programs that limit the damage from cyber attacks, detecting civilian cyber systems in order to warn people in case of intrusion attempts, providing them technical assistance when their computer systems are harmed, providing a back-up system to store civilian data, blocking particular IP addresses which pose risks to civilian systems, and keeping ready a system that makes it possible to disconnect an entire country from the Internet when all measures are exhausted.²⁵² While the title of Article 58 includes ‘attacks’, paragraph (c) clearly states that some precautions should be applied to operations. Although Jensen admits the ambiguity of this situation, he argues that countries which are not parties to the AP-I have responsibility arising from this provision for those acts that reach ‘attack’ threshold.²⁵³ In the Tallinn Manual, even though the majority of experts stated that the rule is applicable only to cyber attacks because of the title of the article and the non-existence of customary law, the minority focused on the wording of paragraph (c) by accepting cyber operations within the ambit of this rule.²⁵⁴ Therefore, the minority view kept the threshold lower, determined disruptive operations to be covered by this rule, and obligated parties to take precautions against the effects of these operations.²⁵⁵ However, both parties have a common understanding on the non-application of the rule to ‘mere inconvenience or irritation’.²⁵⁶ There is no clear-cut answer on which precautions should be taken within the ambit of Article 58(c), since the provision serves as a gap-filler in the article. Despite the fact that it did not receive much attention in the past because the suitability of other provisions for kinetic activities made them more visible than paragraph (c), their relative unsuitability for cyber operations rendered this clause more important. At this point, the implementation of the norm in cyberspace has already begun to be shaped by the practices of both state and non-state actors, and this trend seems to be continuing and getting better. For example, the US government has begun to warn private entities when they are subjected to transborder cyber attacks and has provided them with cyber tools and training to combat those attacks.²⁵⁷ Furthermore, the Security Service of Ukraine informs civilians about cyber threats and what measures to take in order to avoid them.²⁵⁸ As a recent innovative example, the ICRC has been conducting research on creating a ‘digital emblem’ for the past two years in order to enable the identification of objects, systems, or networks that cannot be subject to cyber attacks.²⁵⁹ Lastly, even though these are individual precautionary measures, the Russia-Ukraine War has also demonstrated how state and non-state entities can collaborate to",

The Microsoft Report highlights two examples of cyber security measures against Russian cyber activities: The first has been the use of technology acquired from RiskIQ that identifies and maps organizational attack surfaces, including devices that are unpatched against known vulnerabilities and therefore are the most susceptible to attack. This information has been shared with the Ukrainian government free of charge to enable it to accelerate the strengthening of cyber-defenses. Ukrainian network defenders worked tirelessly with the constant support of the CERT UA within the government to use this information to protect computers across the country. The second measure has been a wartime innovation pursued with the collaboration and support of the Ukrainian government. MSTIC recognized that Russian malware could be mitigated meaningfully by turning on a feature in Microsoft Defender called controlled folder access. This typically would require that IT administrators access devices across their organization, work made more difficult and potentially even dangerous in wartime conditions. The Ukrainian government therefore authorized Microsoft through special legal measures to act proactively and remotely to turn on this feature across devices throughout the government and across the country.²⁶⁰ Every effort having a purpose to minimize collateral damage is desired in cyberspace; the principle of precaution essentially relies on the processes but not the results. # 5 CONCLUSION New technologies have changed the nature of armed conflict significantly, and this process increasingly continues. As one kind of these technologies, cyber operations have introduced significant challenges to the LOAC, but the most unique one is their capability to have a wide range of effects because of the interconnectedness of cyberspace. This article has endeavoured to determine the application of the principle of precautions to cyber operations by tilting the principle towards humanity by considering the natures of both the principle and cyberspace. From the standpoint of the principle of precautions, the Russia-Ukraine War exemplified an important phenomenon: public-private cooperation against adversarial cyber operations. Unlike traditional domains, private entities have a partial but critical level of control over cyberspace, and as a result of this distinctive feature of the current conflicts, the Ukrainian government collaborated with a technology giant, Microsoft.²⁶¹ This collaboration is emphasized in the Microsoft Report by stating that: [U]nlike the traditional threats of the past, cyber defenses rely on a unique level of public and private collaboration. The evolving threat landscape requires a whole-of-society approach. The private sector, particularly technology companies, are on the front lines of cyber and information attacks. Likewise, civil society organizations are key conveners that play a crucial role in engagement, sometimes are involved in cyber data analysis, and are often targets of these campaigns themselves.²⁶² Bringing non-public entities into the equation in cyberspace, thereby putting more civilians in the balance, would enhance the ‘civilianization’ of armed conflicts, and this would inherently lean the principle of precaution on the side of humanity. ²⁶⁰.

The rationale behind this provision is to prevent carrying out attacks against objectives that are not military in nature because of misinformation or against military objectives in order to get a small military advantage by significantly harming civilians and objects.^[105]^ The binding definition of military objectives is codified in Article 52(2) of the AP-I, which states that: [M]ilitary objectives are limited to those objects which by their nature, location, purpose or use make an effective contribution to military action and whose total or partial destruction, capture or neutralization, in the circumstances ruling at the time, offers a definite military advantage. From this definition, there must be two cumulative elements ('two-pronged test')^[106]^ in order to deem an object as military, which are effective contribution and military advantage. For this reason, an object that is military in nature should not be subject to attack if it does not effectively contribute to the military capacity of an enemy.^[107]^ While only Article 52(2) of the AP-I has found its place in the provision, lawful targets also include people who can be made the object of direct cyber attacks. According to the LOAC, various categories of people can be held as lawful targets. The first one consists of combatants who are members of the armed forces and have a right to directly participate in hostilities.^[108]^ Even though they are lawful targets, they have a right to be treated as prisoners of war when they are captured by the enemy.^[109]^ The second category includes direct participants in hostilities. Although they are civilian in nature, they will be accepted as lawful targets if they meet three cumulative criteria which are: threshold of harm, direct causation and belligerent nexus.^[110]^ Those people are lawful targets 'for such time as they take a direct part in hostilities',^[111]^ and if they are captured, they cannot benefit from prisoner of war status. The third category, though there is a discussion on it, consists of members of an organized armed group that is a belligerent party in an armed conflict. They are 'individuals whose continuous function involves the preparation, execution, or command of acts or operations amounting to direct participation in hostilities'.^[112]^"

However, despite its practical importance, the principle of precautions seems to trail behind the other two concepts. This negligence extends not only to scholarly works but also to military doctrines. While the first two principles are often referred to as ‘principles’ in military manuals, the third does not have such a privilege. Nonetheless, it not only confirms or supplements these former principles but also prescribes some preliminary measures to avoid violating them.\nOn the other hand, the Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC) rules, which regulate the application of the principle of precautions, were designed to be applied during conventional warfare. Due to the interconnected nature of the cyber domain, however, it is difficult to apply these rules to cyber operations. Before discussing the complexity posed by the interconnectivity of cyberspace, it should be admitted that it is not unique to the cyber domain; traditional domains have this problem too. Almost half a century ago, the reality that there is ‘a geographical and functional mixture of combatants and civilians and military objectives and civilian objects’ in the conduct of military air\n1.

Despite the similarity between the traditional and cyber domains in terms of interconnectivity, what makes interconnectivity special regarding cyber military operations is that it ‘characterises cyberspace, which means that whatever has an interface with the Internet can be affected by cyber operations conducted from anywhere in the world’. In such a complex environment, the adoption of the principle of precautions while planning and executing cyber operations has utmost importance.\nThe interconnectivity problem should be approached from two perspectives, taking into account both the technical and the social factors. From the first standpoint, technical factors intensify the interconnectedness between military and civilian networks in cyberspace, therefore converting this domain into one of entirely dual-use nature and obstructing the distinction between military targets and civilian objects. As Jensen points out, ‘[w]ith 98% of day-to-day government communications routinely travelling over civilian communication lines, there will be many civilian lines of communication that will carry targetable electronic traffic intermixed with civilian traffic’. From this vantage point, not only is it highly difficult to make a certain distinction between civilian and military cyber infrastructures, but practically all military cyber activities must be carried out through dual-use cyber systems. In the absence of precautionary measures against such interconnectivity, the impacts of cyber activities might quickly spread to other systems across the globe and have the potential to significantly disrupt daily civilian life by having adverse impacts on civilian critical infrastructure and other associated systems. From this point of view, a cyber operation designed to disrupt a dual-used power plant located in a belligerent state could easily impair other systems, from water and food to ICT infrastructure, and its unintended effects might spill over into neutral countries.\nFrom the second point of view, interconnection becomes a more complicated matter when social factors are considered. Even though they are less obvious than technical ones, they still pose threats comparable to those of the latter, and it necessitates especially defensive parties to take unique precautionary measures. Therefore, it has been\n4. US Department of the Air Force, AF Pamphlet 110-31: International Law – The Conduct of Armed Conflict and Air Operations (1976) 5–10.\n5.

This perspective would reveal just how many components are connected and demonstrate the levels of complexity in a facility’. This entails that the human workforce of a facility needs to be considered in terms of the complexity of the system’s network. When this fact about a single facility is considered along with the global challenge of interconnectivity, the magnitude of the interconnectivity issue could be better understood.\nGiven that measures to prevent adversarial effects on cyber systems cannot keep up with their level of interconnectivity, this article aims to portray how to apply the principle of precautions to cyber operations and answers this question by taking its humanity-based character into account. The present author acknowledges that the articles articulating the principle of precautions are vague, as stated by state delegates during the negotiations of Additional Protocol-I or by state legal advisers. Such views on specific provisions of the article or the article as a whole are expressed using terms like ‘open to a variety of interpretations by the conflicting parties’ (for Article 57(2)(a)(ii)), ‘subjective’ ‘ambiguous’ (for Article 57(2)(a)), ‘deficient in clarity due to its generally vague wording’ (for Article 57), and ‘too general’ (for articles between 48 and 58). Moreover, delegates emphasized the hardships posed by applying these provisions in practice. When the complexity of cyberspace interconnectivity is combined with the ambiguity of the articles, applying the principle of precautions appears to bring together two ‘unknown unknowns’ in order to reach one ‘known known’. Throughout this piece of research, the author attempts to emphasize the humanity-based character of the principle of precautions in order to convert this ambiguity into a flexibility to apply the rules more effectively.\nThe LOAC, in general, aims to achieve a balance between military necessity and humanity. From this perspective, it is accepted that some harm will occur; on the\n10. Evans et al (fn 8) 50.\n11.

For example, Sari and Tinkler think that achieving a balance between humanity and necessity in the conduct of hostilities can be held ‘as the object and purpose of Additional Protocol I\n© 2023 The Author\nJournal compilation © 2023 Edward Elgar Publishing Ltd\nDownloaded from https://www.elgaronline.com/ at 07/16/2025 08:36:46PM\nvia University College London (UCL)\nThe application of the principle of precautions to cyber operations 7\nother hand, it should be minimized as much as possible. In other words, ‘[t]he thrust is not absolute elimination of the calamities of war (a goal which would manifestly be utopian), but relief from the tribulations of war “as much as possible” bearing in mind that war is fought to be won’. At this point, it sounds rational that these two notions should be balanced while applying the principles governing the conduct of hostilities.\nOn the other hand, considering the peculiarity of interconnectedness in cyberspace, this balance should be leaned toward humanity while applying the principle of precautions. There are some reasons in favour of such an interpretation. To begin with, the notion of ‘balance’ is significantly subjective. From a practitioner perspective, when the armed conflict starts, reality does not permit such a compromise, and the perception of ‘balance’ is determined by those on the battlefield. However, outside of the conflict, such a balance could be perceived differently by scholars or judges who need to evaluate the legality of such actions, and their views seem more ‘humanitarian’ to practitioners. As stated by Luban, ‘[f]or military lawyers, the starting point is military necessity, and the reigning assumption is that legal regulation of war must accommodate military necessity. For humanitarian lawyers, the starting point is human dignity and human rights’. As a result, such disparities in viewpoints considerably alter the perception of balance, and trying to achieve a balance in the principle of precautions seems to be a rhetorical word.\nApart from the subjectivity of balance depending on different perceptors, the nature of the LOAC principles inherently provides a lean toward either military necessity or humanity. While the principles of distinction and proportionality are more eligible to\nmore generally’. See A Sari and K Tinkler, ‘Collateral Damage and the Enemy’ (2019) British Yearbook of International Law 63. From the standpoint of this article, military necessity is held as a permission giving to a belligerent party in order to ‘apply any amount and kind of force to compel the complete submission of the enemy with the least possible expenditure of time, life, and money’ by not violating the LOAC. See The Hostage Case, Case No. 7 (United States v. Wilhelm List et al.), (Opinion and Judgment and Sentence) [1949] 1253 (‘The Hostage Case’). Pictet defines humanity as ‘a sentiment of active goodwill towards mankind’ by referring to Littré’s dictionary. See J Pictet, The Fundamental Principles of the Red Cross (1956) 143. By considering this definition, this article holds the principle of humanity as a ‘guiding principle that puts a brake on undertakings which might otherwise be justified by the principle of military necessity’.

The crux of the former principles is based on gaining military advantage on the battlefield, and the notion of military advantage ‘has a particular resonance with “military necessity”’. This naturally bends those principles’ interpretation in the direction of military necessity. On the other hand, the central tenet of the principle of precautions is based on the minimization of civilian harm. It obliges belligerent parties to take active or passive precautionary measures to mitigate risks, which derive from military operations, towards civilians and civilian property in armed conflicts. In line with this, it is not good enough for soldiers ‘merely not intending civilian harm’, but they also ‘must intend not to harm civilians’.\nGiven that the nature of the principles requires that they be construed by leaning towards one side, analyzing the principle of precautions by considering the balance poses a risk that it turns into an ‘illusory rule’. According to Schwarzenberger:\n[Illusory rules]... are merely a formal compromise between the standard of civilization and the necessities of war. Here, in fact the rule of force is supreme. Rules which expressly proclaim the necessities of war as an overriding constituent element or are emasculated by an ‘as far as possible’ clause illustrate this perhaps slightly hypocritical variant of the rules of warfare.\nThus, by turning the principle into an ‘illusory rule’, it would be very easy for belligerent parties to refrain from effectively applying the principle of precautions by putting terms such as ‘feasible’ or ‘unless circumstances do not permit’ on the table. To preclude such excuses, one should hold it as a rule that ‘sets limitations to warfare in cases in which considerations of civilization demand priority over military interest’. As correctly held by the Madagascar delegate, ‘[t]he article reflected a laudable desire to narrow the gap between the ideal and the possible, and to deal from a humanitarian standpoint with two opposite positions, namely, the aggressor’s and the victim’s’. Per this point of view, the application of the principle of precautions by taking ‘one small step’ toward humanity could be ‘one giant leap’ toward a more appropriate\n.

When the inherent bending of these principles toward military necessity and only their recognition as ‘principles’ in military manuals are considered, the consequence is admitted by Maurer that ‘[i]n more than one context, the balance between military “necessity” and protection concerns has heavily tilted towards military logics, and norms have been implicitly downgraded to mere discretionary guidance’.

In section 3, the precautions that shall be taken by the attacking side of the conflict according to Article 57 of Additional Protocol-I will be examined. In the first part of the section, target verification in cyber operations will be discussed, and some important questions will be answered, e.g., does technical superiority play any role on the precautionary level? Or what is the requisite level of certainty? In the second part, the choice of cyber means and methods will be addressed. The proportionality rule in precautions in planning and executing cyber attacks will be determined in the third part. Not only will key terms such as ‘military advantage’ and ‘incidental harm’ be discussed in that section, but also some grey areas, e.g., the consideration of indirect effects. The fourth part will explain effective warning before launching cyber attacks, and the final part will explain the least-danger rule. In the fourth section, precautions that shall be taken by a party that is subject to cyber operations will be addressed. In this chapter, the segregation of civilian and military objectives in cyberspace, the location of cyber military objectives, and other measures will be questioned, respectively.\n## 2 THE REGULATION OF THE PRINCIPLE OF PRECAUTIONS, BASIC TERMS AND RESPONSIBILITY\n### 2.1 The regulation of the principle of precautions\nWhile it is not stated conspicuously, the first implication of the principle of precautions can be found in Article 27 of the Hague Convention IV, in which it is stated that:\nIn sieges and bombardments all necessary steps must be taken to spare, as far as possible, buildings dedicated to religion, art, science, or charitable purposes, historic monuments, hospitals, and places where the sick and wounded are collected, provided they are not being used at the time for military purposes.\nIn the following process, the prohibition to launch an attack against civilians and to spare them as much as possible found a place in various official documents. However, the first binding regulation of the principle of precautions appeared in the AP-I,\n. ‘The principles of distinction, precautions and proportionality thus complement each other in a way that achieves a subtle balance between military necessity and humanitarian imperatives.’ See Sari and Tinkler (fn 21) 4.\n. International Conferences (The Hague), Hague Convention (IV) Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land and Its Annex: Regulations Concerning the Laws and Customs of War on Land, 18 October 1907.\n. See League of Nations Res ‘Protection of Civilian Populations Against Bombing from the Air in Case of War’ (30 September 1938). Later, more detailed rules were articulated in Articles 8, 9 and 11 of the Draft Rules for the Limitation of the Dangers incurred by the Civilian Population in Time of War (1956). Despite the fact that states did not adopt these rules, they had an impact on the rules codified in Additional Protocols. See S Watts, ‘Law-of-War Precautions: A Cautionary Note’ in RTP Alcala and E Talbot Jensen (eds), The Impact of Emerging Technologies on the Law of Armed Conflict (Oxford University Press, 2019) 116.\n© 2023 The Author\nJournal compilation © 2023 Edward Elgar Publishing Ltd\nDownloaded from https://www.elgaronline.com/ at 07/16/2025 08:36:46PM via University College London (UCL)\nThe Military Law and the Law of War Review, Vol. 61 No. 1\nin which it is stated that both attacking and defending parties shall take precautions to spare civilians and civilian objects in an armed conflict. At this point, for *jus in bello* cyberspace operations, the principle of precautions provides a twofold protection: the first comprises taking constant care while conducting cyber attacks ('precautions in attack'), and the second comprises taking feasible precautions in order to protect civilians from the effects of cyber attacks ('precautions against the effects of attacks') during armed conflicts. These precautions can also be named 'active' and 'passive' precautions ruled under Articles 57 and 58 of the AP-I.\nThe rules stated in Articles 57 and 58 are applied in times of armed conflicts, though the definition of 'armed conflict' is not provided in the Protocol. In this article, the definition given in the Tadic Decision, in which it was described as 'a resort to armed force between States or protracted armed violence between governmental authorities and organized armed groups or between such groups within a State',[39] is adopted. From this definition, it can be stated that there are two types of armed conflicts; 'between States' (international armed conflicts), and 'between governmental authorities and organized armed groups or between such groups' (non-international armed conflicts). In identifying the nature of the conflict, the status of the actors is the decisive factor.[40] The importance of this distinction is that while the AP-I, which is applicable to international armed conflicts, clearly states the obligation to take precautions, there is no clear provision which regulates the principle of precautions in Additional Protocol-II,[41] which is applicable to non-international armed conflicts. However, it does not prevent the application of the principle to the latter type of conflicts since it is stated in Article 13(1) of the AP-II that '[t]he civilian population and individual civilians shall enjoy general protection against the dangers arising from military operations'. Therefore, it is argued in the work of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) on Customary Rules that, by approving the customary nature of the principle for both international and non-international armed conflict, it is hard to abide by such a rule without taking any precaution.[42] Moreover, it is stated in the Tadic Decision that 'all necessary precautions should be taken to avoid injury, loss or damage to civilian populations' in all kinds of armed conflicts by referring to a resolution adopted by the United Nations General Assembly.[43] Finally, two recent treaties that are applicable to non-international armed conflicts explicitly regulate the principle of precautions.[44]\n39.

However, when these provisions are read together with Article 49, it might cause confusion in the first instance because while Article 49(3) clearly restricts the application of Section IV rules of the AP-I to operations conducted in the air or sea which have impacts on ‘civilians or civilian objects on land’, Article 57(4) seems to obligate parties to respect the principle of precautions in the conduct of these operations without any limitation. To solve this problem, one should deem Article 57(4) as ‘merely a restatement of one of the existing rules’. As Article 49(3) makes clear, the article does not affect those rules that are customary in nature and applicable to all types of military operations. Therefore, Article 57(4) does not contradict but rather ‘complement’ it.\nSince the principle of precautions applies to both operations and attacks, both of these terms should be clarified. At this point, military operations are ‘any movements, manoeuvres and other activities whatsoever carried out by the armed forces with a view to combat’. Therefore, all parties to the conflict should exercise constant care while conducting their military operations. For instance, if a tank driver harms civilian property while maneuvering the vehicle, he/she will be responsible due to the breach of the principle of precautions. From this perspective, if a perpetrator destroys a civilian network while conducting cyber exploitation against either a civilian or military cyber system, he/she will bear responsibility. However, military attacks require a certain threshold since they are violent acts causing death, injury, damage, or destruction – or at least intending to do so. As a result, all military attacks are kinds of military operations but vice versa would not be true. Therefore, while cyber operation can be defined as ‘the employment of cyber capabilities to achieve objectives in or through cyberspace’, cyber attack is ‘a cyber operation, whether offensive or defensive, that is reasonably expected to cause injury or death to persons or damage or destruction to objects’. In light of this, cyber attack is a special kind of cyber operation that results in violent effects. However, cyber attacks require a broader understanding because damage to objects may occur as a secondary effect of cyber operations. Therefore, the present author agrees with the approach of the majority of the International Group of Experts (the Experts), who prepared the Tallinn Manual, that cyber operations that result in the replacement of a component by having an impact on the functionality of an object fall within the ambit of attack because, while these kinds of operations do not damage an object in the first instance, their effects in later phases reach the threshold of attack by causing physical harm.\n.

At this point, the applicability of international law to cyber operations is recognized by states and international organizations. Also, there is a certain difference between a cyber operation and an attack, and not all precautionary measures are applicable to all kinds of cyber operations.\n## 2.2 Constant care\nAccording to Article 57(1) of the AP-I, the attacking party shall always take ‘constant care’ to spare civilians and civilian objects while conducting military operations. The term ‘constant care’ is clarified in the HPCR Manual Commentary by stating that ‘there are no exceptions from the duty to seek to spare the civilian population, civilians and civilian objects’. Therefore, constant care obliges all levels of the armed forces who are responsible for planning, ordering or executing a cyber operation to always consider the results of it and try to minimize its effects on civilians.\nThe ‘constant care’ obligation is necessary for cyber operations. Those who are involved in the operation should always be aware of the foreseeable effects of operations on the civilian population and property and try to minimize these effects as much as possible. For this reason, it is not enough to demonstrate due care in the planning stage; this obligation extends to all stages of the operation in which civilians might be affected. In other words, these people should have ‘situational awareness at all times’. The concept of situational awareness is explained in the Allied Joint Doctrine for Cyberspace Operations by describing it as ‘a combination of a near real-time updated RCP [Recognised Cyberspace Picture], analysis and information management’. Although the obligation is constrained by the execution stage of an operation as described in the article, the effects of the attack can continue. For example, in the\n.

Although Jensen notes that this ‘at least implicates the constant-care standard and informs State practice on the issue’, the present author considers that the possible effects of the cyber operations after their execution are better understood 10 years later, so states should seek to stop or at least limit the effects of operations after their military objective is accomplished.\nOn the other hand, the application of the rule in cyberspace poses a significant hurdle since almost all cyber operations might affect or harm civilian cyber infrastructure to some extent. However, after all feasible precautions have been taken by an attacker, the relevant rule will be proportionality. If the effects of the operation on civilians are not excessive compared to the anticipated military advantage, then the attacking party may continue to carry out cyber operations. However, the calculation may be difficult because of the time-sensitivity. Planned operations give more chance to the attacking party to take better precautions, though time-sensitive ones generally do not permit sufficient time to implement more suitable precautions. Although the impact of such a condition on precautions is not deniable, it does not give permission to the attacker to deviate from the principle because the constant care obligation necessitates parties to take feasible precautions in all circumstances.\nThe second significant hurdle might be the secretive nature of cyberspace since ambiguity is at the centre of cyber warfare. Even though attribution may be difficult in that domain and the perpetrator of cyber acts that violate the LOAC cannot be easily found, parties to the conflict should obey the rules of the LOAC by considering warrior ethics. From this perspective, cyber warriors should always seek ways to mitigate risks towards civilians in good faith since ‘[r]espect for LOAC obligations is the essential touchstone for that ethical foundation’. This ethical foundation serves for better protection of civilians, which is an inherent objective of the LOAC.\nLast but not least, the ‘constant care’ obligation should not be accepted as limited to this article. It involves all phases of operations and attacks, which are carried out by both attacking and defending parties. For this reason, it has a guidance function while examining all provisions of Articles 57 and 58.\n## 2.3 Feasibility\nArticle 57 obliges parties to take ‘feasible’ precautions in order to minimize the effects of an attack on civilians and civilian objects. In the Official Commentary of Article 57, it is stated that those precautions are ‘everything that was practicable or practically possible, taking into account all the circumstances at the time of the attack, including\n.

At this point, every situation has its unique features, and those responsible for an attack should adapt various precautions by considering the characteristics of the situation. For example, an attacker party should map the target network through exploitation operations if it is connected to other civilian networks.71 In such situations, LOAC not only permits cyber espionage but also obligates a belligerent party to conduct these operations. However, such operations require a certain level of technical expertise, and in the absence of that, such a network should not be exploited.72 Despite such expertise, some mistakes may occur in the 'fog of war'.73 At this point, a commander who took 'all due measures' is not responsible for this harm.74 Those measures can be identified by different factors such as available cyber means, time sensitivity, the cyber defence system of the enemy, the characteristics of the target, intelligence assets, the expertise of the attacking team, the loyalty of the enemy of to the LOAC, and available assets and vulnerabilities of the enemy.75 However, even if feasible precautions are taken, unintended results may occur for various reasons, such as failure of the intelligence system, dysfunction of the technology, or unexpected changes in tactical conditions.76 For instance, a commander might prepare a map of a cyber network before conducting an attack, but the virus unintentionally spreads among the civilian infrastructure, which has a connection with the military network.77 At this point, while deciding on whether the principle of precautions is respected or not, one should not focus on outcomes, but compliance should be measured by the process in which an\n68.

For instance, if an attacker has advanced cyber capabilities that make it possible to disrupt an electrical grid without harming civilians but prefers to carry out an attack by conventional means – which results in civilian damage – it cannot claim that its adversary does not use the same level of technology to refrain from harming civilians. Thus, it is true that each party has a responsibility ‘within its means or methods or its capability’ as stated by the Indian delegate.\nEven if the commander has advanced cyber weapons, he/she may try to spare them for use during later stages of the conflict by taking military considerations into account. Therefore, it is permitted for the military commander in the Naval Manual of Ecuador to use alternative methods ‘in light of all the facts known or reasonably available to him, including the need to conserve resources and complete the mission successfully’. However, if it is understood that using less advanced weapons will result in excessive collateral damage, then they should either use advanced ones or cancel the attack.\nOn the other hand, the determination of feasibility on a contextual basis should not be used to assuage the burden from the shoulders of the attacker. For example, the use of white phosphorus shells near al-Wafa hospital, where patients have serious injuries and need long-term care, by the Israeli armed forces was deemed a violation of Articles 57(2)(b) and (c) of the AP-I. It was stated that those who were responsible for the attack should be aware of ‘all the facts and circumstances’. For this reason, while conducting a cyber operation against a system in which some medical records may be located, the attacking party should take special care. The same is valid for facilities such as dams, where dangerous forces are located.\n## 2.4 Responsibility\nThe wording of Article 57 restricts its applicability to ‘those who plan or decide upon an attack’. Because of this wording, some states have expressed reservations about Article 57, claiming that it only applies to ‘commanding officers at the battalion or group level and those of higher ranks’. Nonetheless, every soldier who breaches obligations imposed by the LOAC bears individual criminal responsibility for his/her acts when such crimes are committed with ‘intent and knowledge’.

Also, it might be possible to operate in smaller groups in different types of warfare, such as national liberation wars or transnational armed conflicts. In line with this, the rule should be applied at ‘whatever level the regulated functions are being performed’ since every soldier who conducts military operations against an adversary by aiming to obtain military advantage participates in the decision-making process in the theatre of war. As a result, individuals ‘who have the authority and practical possibility to affect the course of an attack’ should be held accountable for cyber activities.\nIn cyberspace, it may be very hard to calculate the effects of an attack by planners or decision makers since the interconnectedness of civilian and military networks prevents the attacking party from properly calculating the effects of an attack and from taking feasible precautions in order to minimize them. Also, the velocity of computer systems operating at high speed makes it difficult to predict the indirect effects of cyber attacks. As it is stated in the ICRC Expert Meeting:\nOwing to how the internet is designed and operates, there will always be the risk of other systems or networks being affected. The reason is that volumetric attacks can end up using all available channel capacity, which would affect the networks on the path to the target. This has happened in the past, with powerful DDoS attacks launched against specific targets and affecting entire internet infrastructure providers.\nHowever, the unpredictability of effects does not relieve the responsibility of all levels of command while conducting operations. According to Watkin, operational factors cannot be put forward in order not to take feasible precautions in today’s trend, which pursues to compromise ‘human rights-like accountability frameworks with operational decision making during armed conflict’. Accordingly, all members of the armed forces who are part of operations in cyberspace should do everything feasible within their limits.\nWhile assessing the individual responsibility of officers, they should be judged by how much they know about a certain subject. The well-known example is the Rendulic Decision, in which the Nuremberg Tribunal held that ‘the “scorched earth” policy in\n Sandoz, Swinarski and Zimmermann (eds) (fn 3) 2197; APV Rogers, ‘General Report-Conduct of Combat and Risks Run by the Civilian Population’ (1982) 21 Mil.

For this reason, later evidence which showed that ‘the danger did not actually exist’$^{98}$ cannot be used to convict the commander since he ‘acted within the limits of honest judgment on the basis of the conditions prevailing at the time’.$^{99}$ This is crucial considering the interconnectivity of cyberspace since cyber attacks might affect civilian networks unexpectedly despite a commander’s employment of the advanced technology to conduct constant surveillance over a network.$^{100}$ At this point, the responsibility arising out of a cyber attack would not go beyond what the defendant knew at the time of the attack.\nOn the other hand, one needs to distinguish misinformation from misconception. Misconception of the nature of the target might occur because of cognitive bias, which misdirects attackers by analyzing information ‘in a manner that supports their pre-existing beliefs or mental frameworks’.$^{101}$ States should employ a variety of techniques such as ‘training and education, red teaming procedures, specific positive identification (PID) policies for targeting, use of structured analytic techniques, and other analytic tradecraft practices’ in order for this not to result in civilian damage.$^{102}$ Despite the fact that states are keen to protect soldiers in such situations,$^{103}$ inflicting civilian harm due to biased decisions does not very well fit with the notion of ‘honest judgement’.\nLastly, those who undertake cyber operations may be fully aware of the results of their actions owing to their technical expertise since cyberspace requires unique understanding compared to traditional domains. If a higher commander issues an order to launch a cyber operation without being aware of the outcomes in good faith, inferior commanders will be responsible for such intentional conduct. However, if a commander is aware that he lacks sufficient information about a target, he should either change the concept of the attack or refrain from issuing such an order.$^{104}$ Should an operation continue to be carried out while being aware of this insufficiency, responsibility arises.\n# 3 PRECAUTIONS IN ATTACK\n## 3.1 Target verification\nIt is stated in Article 57(2) of the AP-I that:\n(a) those who plan or decide upon an attack shall:\n(i) do everything feasible to verify that the objectives to be attacked are neither civilians nor civilian objects and are not subject to special protection but are military objectives within the\n97.

For this reason, an object that is military in nature should not be subject to attack if it does not effectively contribute to the military capacity of an enemy.^[107]^\nWhile only Article 52(2) of the AP-I has found its place in the provision, lawful targets also include people who can be made the object of direct cyber attacks. According to the LOAC, various categories of people can be held as lawful targets. The first one consists of combatants who are members of the armed forces and have a right to directly participate in hostilities.^[108]^ Even though they are lawful targets, they have a right to be treated as prisoners of war when they are captured by the enemy.^[109]^\nThe second category includes direct participants in hostilities. Although they are civilian in nature, they will be accepted as lawful targets if they meet three cumulative criteria which are: threshold of harm, direct causation and belligerent nexus.^[110]^ Those people are lawful targets 'for such time as they take a direct part in hostilities',^[111]^ and if they are captured, they cannot benefit from prisoner of war status.\nThe third category, though there is a discussion on it, consists of members of an organized armed group that is a belligerent party in an armed conflict. They are 'individuals whose continuous function involves the preparation, execution, or command of acts or operations amounting to direct participation in hostilities'.^[112]^\n105.

In the Interpretive Guidance on the Notion of Direct Participation in Hostilities, definitions of these criteria read as follows: '1. the act must be likely to adversely affect the military operations or military capacity of a party to an armed conflict or, alternatively, to inflict death, injury, or destruction on persons or objects protected against direct attack (threshold of harm), and 2. there must be a direct causal link between the act and the harm likely to result either from that act, or from a coordinated military operation of which that act constitutes an integral part (direct causation), and 3. the act must be specifically designed to directly cause the required threshold of harm in support of a party to the conflict and to the detriment of another (belligerent nexus).'

The result of this distinction is that those who directly participate in hostilities lose their protected status only for a limited period of time, but the last category of individuals loses it ‘as long as they remain members’, and this membership renders them lawful targets ‘even before he or she first carries out a hostile act’.\nAfter it was stated in the Official Commentary that the military commander does not need to have personal knowledge, it was argued that even if there is a ‘slight doubt’, additional information shall be obtained. By supporting it, Rogers points out that ‘[i]n the event of doubt about the nature of the target, an attack should not be carried out, with a possible exception where failure to prosecute the attack would put attacking forces in immediate danger’. However, this approach is challenged by some states, which claim that the determination should be ‘substantial doubt’ to suspend an attack and require supplementary information. In the same vein, various authors claimed that conducting military operations without having a doubt on the nature of a target is not a reasonable expectation in the fog of war. From this perspective, there is always some doubt as an inherent characteristic of combat. On the other hand, the present author thinks that the Official Commentary should be interpreted as the aim of a commander. By stating the ‘slight doubt’ requirement, the commentary obligates them to take better precautions even if it is possible to erase this doubt. This is approved by military practice, in which attacks are cancelled when combatants are not ‘certain’ or ‘100 percent sure of their aiming point’. According to Parks, the US achieved this level of accuracy during the Linebacker II campaign by constantly confirming the nature of targets, implementing rules set by the Strategic Air Command, and issuing bomb damage assessments after each attack. Despite the fact that such high-level precautions sometimes pose substantial risks to the combatants’ lives, he acknowledges that they are important not only in terms of legality but also for achieving military and political objectives. By considering such positive outcomes, a commander should be sure enough that he/she made reasonable efforts to verify the nature of the target in cyberspace.\n113. Ibid.\n114. Ibid at 34, 71.\n115.

At this point, cyber attack should be limited to that component, which is military in nature. If it is not possible, then the attack should be cancelled. However, this should not be equated with being ‘perfectly familiar with the network’ since such an interpretation is not appropriate with the term ‘feasible’.\n## 3.2 Choice of cyber means and methods\nAfter the nature of the target is verified, the next step will be to compose an operational plan that will have a minimum effect on civilians. At this point, it is stated in Article 57 (2)(a)(ii) of the AP-I that members of the armed forces should ‘take all feasible precautions in the choice of means and methods of attack with a view to avoiding, and in any event to minimising, incidental loss or civilian life, injury to civilians and damage to civilian objects’. This means that even if an attack is proportionate, parties to the conflict should be careful in their choice of means and methods in order to minimize the effects of attacks as much as possible while still aiming to obtain maximum military advantage. At this point, an attacking party should produce a plan that promises to give the most efficient operational and legal results.\nIt is important to define ‘cyber means’ and ‘methods’. Cyber means are defined as ‘cyber weapons and their associated cyber systems’ in the Tallinn Manual. At this point, cyber weapons are kinds of cyber means, but the latter includes a broader category. Cyber methods, on the other hand, are defined as ‘the cyber tactics, techniques, and procedures by which hostilities are conducted’. Whilst cyber means are concerned with which tools should be employed to carry out cyber operations, cyber methods are concerned with how these operations should be carried out. Based on this viewpoint, while botnets are a type of cyber means, the DDoS attack that is conducted by botnets can be considered a type of cyber method.\nThere is no weapon or method that is specifically prohibited in the provision. It only obliges parties to take feasible precautions by choosing appropriate means and methods; thereby, a commander will not be responsible for causing civilian harm. However, the rule does not require parties to choose means and methods that may decrease their expected military advantage. Even if alternative means and methods are not used because of this concern, a planned cyber attack must abide by other principles such as distinction and proportionality. On the other hand, if choosing different means and methods may change the degree of damage by producing ‘equivalent effects’ upon the target, then alternative means or methods shall be selected.

However, this may result in civilian deaths who live in the vicinity of the facility. At this point, if an attacking party has available means to conduct a cyber attack, it shall use them against the system or computers in the facility to stop belligerent attacks. Additionally, military personnel’s expertise with those new technologies is crucial. The concern was raised in the Eritrea-Ethiopia Claims Commission. Even though Eritrea refused Ethiopia’s allegations that some of its aircraft intentionally attacked civilians, the inexperience of Eritrean pilots in using ‘computerized aiming systems’, which led to the failure to target military objectives, was held as a violation of Article 57 of the AP-I. Lastly, a ‘target list’ can be prepared and constantly reviewed by belligerent parties in order to determine which type of weapon should be used to decrease civilian harm by considering the characteristics of the target. For example, the bombardment of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) compound by the Israeli Armed Forces, which resulted in extensive damage and endangered the lives of many civilians, was accepted as reckless conduct and a violation of Article 57(2)(a)(ii) of the AP-I since it was executed while being aware of its importance for civilians. However, in the Vietnam War, the US employed fragmentation bombs that had limited effects on the target to execute attacks against anti-aircraft batteries; since these batteries were located inside dikes, the army tried to refrain from damaging them.\nThe accuracy and range of weapons also have a particular importance in the execution of attacks. If a target can be destroyed by accurate weapons, then it does not make sense to use dumb bombs or other means whose effects may not be calculated properly or limited. In this sense, the US practice in the Linebacker II campaign is important. During the campaign, the B-52s that have wide-range effects were employed because of weather conditions and the limited number of the more precise weapons. But to keep the collateral damage to a minimum, the B-52s were used against targets that were either sufficiently large or in military-industrial complexes. Other objectives requiring pinpoint strikes, such as bridges and railroad yards, were hit by more precise weapons when weather conditions permitted, which was limited to 12 hours during the 12-day campaign.\nAs such practice in a highly interconnected battle arena demonstrates, cyber means and weapons should be used against adversaries while always considering their accuracy and range. When it would not be possible to precisely damage a cyber target that is interconnected with a civilian network, they should be used against military cyber networks, or at least those networks whose destruction does not have a significant impact on civilians. In this manner, a cyber mean can be designed to affect only a specific type of system, as it was in the Stuxnet incident, in which malware only affected the SCADA systems.\n.

The term refers to malware that is able to ‘recognize the environment it finds itself in and then execute itself only if the target system precisely matches that environment’. Recent events demonstrate that states follow this trend by using precise cyber means. At this point, the Russia-Ukraine War is of particular importance, and it should be carefully examined.\nIn the report prepared by Microsoft (the Microsoft Report), it is claimed that:\nRussian cyber tactics in the war have differed from those deployed in the NotPetya attack against Ukraine in 2017. That attack used ‘wormable’ destructive malware that could jump from one computer domain to another and hence cross borders into other countries. Russia has been careful in 2022 to confine destructive ‘wiper software’ to specific network domains inside Ukraine itself. But the recent and ongoing destructive attacks themselves have been sophisticated and more widespread than many reports recognize. And the Russian army is continuing to adapt these destructive attacks to changing war needs, including by coupling cyberattacks with the use of conventional weapons.\nThis passage raises two concerns. First, which types of cyber means are used? Second, excluding other considerations such as political or military ones, why did the Russians allegedly employ such means in an armed conflict while adhering to the LOAC?\nAs an answer to the first question, the Microsoft Report lists cyber means that were used or are in use in the Russia-Ukraine War:\n1.

Even though the Microsoft Report does not give detail about number 5, another report states that it deletes data from physical and logical drives, though its impact is limited.

This brings an important issue to the surface. Even though the debate exists, operations causing such damage do not constitute attacks in terms of *lex lata*. Therefore, it would not be possible to apply Article 57 (2)(a)(ii) to those malwares since the rule encompasses means of warfare that are ‘used, designed, or intended to be used to conduct a cyber attack’. Then the question would be why Russia needs to employ such discriminatory cyber means.\nFrom the present author’s perspective, the war demonstrated that the key benefit of using cyber means in warfare is their adaptability, instead of previous assumptions that cyber operations provide a belligerent party an advantage owing to their low cost or non-attributability. As stated in the report, Russia adapted such means to ‘changing war needs’. This adaptation should be seen from two perspectives: cyber and kinetic. The former is important from a technical standpoint, and the latter is important from a legal standpoint, but both of them need to be examined because of their importance from a military standpoint.\nEven though it does not have a direct relationship with the legality of cyber means in terms of Article 57(2)(a)(ii), the technical standing point is important to understand why parties adopt cyber means in armed conflicts. Every new step in technology has the potential to threaten the kinetic weapon supremacy of an adversary. For example, the invention of a new type of surface-to-air missile system can erase the advantage of the adversary’s aircraft, and the attacking party needs to make a huge investment to improve its aircraft and produce new ones to establish a new squadron. On the other hand, the adaptability of cyber means makes it possible for past used malware to escape from such quick elimination. By adding some extra codes, a cyber weapon can be adjusted based on a new type of cyber security measure, and such modification can turn it into a new type of weapon. As stated by the ICRC, ‘it is possible for offensive cyber capabilities to be reverse-engineered or repurposed so that they can be reused. This is also the case for some traditional weapon systems, but the technical characteristics of cyberspace raise these concerns in a unique manner’. This uniqueness has been and continues to be demonstrated in the Russia-Ukraine War. Numerous reports claim that Russia used or is using malware by modifying previously used ones. In other words, cyber security updates also bring updates to those malwares, and they are adapted to changing needs in the cyber environment. For example, AcidRain, a wiper malware used to disrupt the VIASAT satellite, shares some characteristics with VPNFilter, a kind of malware used by Russia-backed cyber-organized groups in 2018. Also, such modifications do not have to take a long time. Shortly after the intrusion of WhisperGate into Ukrainian systems and its detection by cyber security companies, Russia altered it and developed a new type of malware, Hermeticwiper, that ‘has some similarities to the earlier WhisperGate’. This shows that detecting malware and taking defensive measures against it do not make such malware useless, but certain parts of the codes can still be used by belligerents to improve their cyber capabilities owing to their adaptability.\n.

Figure 1 above, depicted by Microsoft, shows how critical infrastructures are subject to cyber operations as the Russian tanks roll toward cities. Additionally, the fact that certain facilities, which are being physically attacked, were subject to cyber operations, demonstrates that the coordination is not general but rather as specific as possible. As a result, every operation that is part of an attack has to be evaluated within the meaning of the LOAC, and this necessitates evaluating the cyber means stated above to be employed by respecting relevant rules, including the principle of precautions.\nWhile choosing cyber methods, the first relevant factor is the timing of the attack to minimize collateral damage.[154] During World War II, Allied Forces conducted attacks on military factories at times when there were a minimum number of civilian workers present.[155] In that vein, for example, while carrying out cyber attacks against dual-use objects, the belligerent party may execute them at night or early in the morning when the targets are not intensively used by civilians.\n153.

If a target is located in a place that is mostly used by civilians and there is a significant level of risk of harm occurring, the attacker shall use the most accurate weapons available or must refrain from conducting such an attack. At this point, there is a discussion on whether the Internet can be held as a lawful target because, while it might make an effective contribution to the military capacity of the enemy, it is mostly used by civilians. Even though it is argued that if an attacking party believes that it can get enough military advantage, a cyber attack against the Internet is permissible, another opinion accepts the Internet as a civilian object and prohibits such an attack. According to the latter opinion, even if it is intended to carry out a cyber attack against the Internet, it should be limited to ‘individual networks, servers, routers, links, and other computer facilities that are used for military purposes and which are likely to be connected to the Internet’. By accepting the latter interpretation, the present author considers that if it is possible to considerably limit the effects of the attack, especially by considering the dual nature of cyberspace, then an attack may be conducted. If not, it will be in breach of the rule.\nWhilst some authors argue that the choice of means and methods only come onto the scene when there is a similar advantage, the present author thinks that the criteria should not be applied strictly. As stated by Borghard and Lonergan while discussing coercion in cyberspace, the attacking party tries to apply less harmful ways, such as disruptive operations rather than destructive ones, in order to better negotiate at later stages since the system may be restored more easily when the former type of means are used. At this point, the belligerent party should choose the type of means or methods to achieve the intended outcomes by considering the post-conflict situation. There is no doubt that a large number of civilian deaths will prolong the conflict, even if the attacks are perfectly legal. The bombing of Radio-Television of Serbia by NATO, which sparked so many debates about the legality of the campaign, may be an example of the adverse impact of such conduct. To Kolb, even if the station can be assumed as a military objective, it was repaired in three hours, and 16 civilians were killed because of the attack. By taking lessons from this example, it can be stated that belligerent parties should always consider alternatives, even if a designed cyber attack seems lawful. In such a case, disrupting broadcasting by cyber operation might produce better consequences, even though it seems that destruction promises more advantage. In these kinds of situations, perpetrators should always keep the humanitarian aims of the LOAC in mind.\n.

However, both of these provisions have similar meanings by prohibiting attacks conducted against a legitimate target if it seems that ‘excessive’ collateral damage will occur, whether the cyber attack is being planned or has already been planned. At this point, there should be a balance between military advantage and civilian harm.\n## 3.3.1 Military advantage\nThe advantage should be military in nature rather than merely moral, political or financial. For example, conducting cyber attacks against specific sectors of a country, such as the oil industry, which is vital for Arab countries, by considering that such an operation against ‘war-sustaining objects’ will decrease the military effort of an enemy is not appropriate since ‘almost every civilian activity might be construed by the enemy as indirectly sustaining the war effort’ as stated by Dinstein. Also, it is stated in the Official Commentary that this type of advantage can only be gained by the annihilation of an enemy or gaining ground; the transformation of the notion of war, however, changed this paradigm. While the former can be categorized as an overstatement, the latter seems to be an understatement. Hence, as a moderate approach, the HPCR Manual Commentary points out that ‘any consequence of an attack which directly enhances friendly military operations or hinders those of the enemy’ should be included within the ambit of military advantage.\nCyber attacks should be assessed as a whole while aiming to obtain military advantage. As stated by Fenrick and approved by declarations of numerous states, proportionality calculations cannot be made on either ‘a bullet-by-bullet basis’ or ‘the basis of attacks on individual military objectives’. Furthermore, when the army launches concerted or coordinated cyber attacks, it may be impossible or impractical for every\n. Boothby (fn 158) 125–27.\n. HPCR Manual Commentary 45.\n.

At this point, the planning stage has significant importance, and an attack should be judged by looking at the bigger picture. Although it was claimed that people who give an order will bear responsibility rather than those who execute the attack in such a case, if it is apparent that the targeted network is civilian in nature after the attack is initiated, it should be cancelled or a confirmation should be demanded by the perpetrator from higher ranks in light of changing circumstances. Lastly, assessing a cyber attack as a whole should not be interpreted as having a purpose to obtain military advantage by taking the ‘full context of a war strategy’ into account. Otherwise, all cyber attacks, whether they incur excessive civilian damages or not, can be deemed legal in defiance of the aims of the LOAC.\n## 3.3.2 Collateral damage\nCollateral damage can be described as an ‘incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians and damage to civilian objects or other protected objects or a combination thereof, caused by an attack on a lawful target’. At this point, collateral damage occurs while conducting cyber attacks against military targets without deliberately targeting civilians and civilian property.\nCollateral damage includes both the direct and indirect effects of a cyber attack. While the former type of effects are those that ‘are the immediate, first order consequence of a military action (weapons employment results, etc.), unaltered by intervening events or mechanisms’; the latter type of effects are ‘the delayed or displaced second-, third-, and higher-order consequences of action, created through intermediate events or mechanisms’. Since cyber operations are carried out at the logical layer of cyberspace, their first-order effects have an impact on data, programs, or software; nevertheless, such effects are not included in the aforementioned definition of collateral damage. Yet, ‘indirect effects may be aimed at the other layers of cyberspace, or at creating other higher-order effects in other domains’, and thereby such effects can raise the level of collateral damage. Therefore, the inclusion of indirect effects in the concept of collateral harm is crucial. However, due to the complexity involved in calculating second- or higher-order effects, such an inclusion also poses a significant challenge in cyberspace. As acknowledged in the Allied Doctrine:\nSince cyberspace is a global domain, there is a risk of COs [cyberspace operations] having an impact outside the joint operations area. COs can create undesired effects on our own\n. Quéguiner (fn 154) 804.\n. Ibid at 804–805.\n.

This risk, as with similar risks in other domains, is factored into the planning.\nEven though it is not necessary to make certain calculations, effects which are too remote or beyond the scope of reasonable certainty will not cause any responsibility for combatants. Lastly, collateral damage does not contain minor effects such as stress, irritation or inconvenience. All cyber attacks might cause stress or inconvenience to some extent, but that does not make them illegal.\n## 3.3.3 Excessive collateral damage\nBelligerent parties should always consider whether the expected military advantage is proportionate compared to the anticipated collateral damage. At this point, the terms ‘extensive’ and ‘excessive’ should be differentiated. In the Official Commentary, it was argued that conducting attacks against lawful targets should not create ‘extensive destruction of civilian objects’ despite the fact that there is no reference to such a limitation in the Additional Protocols. The collateral damage can be justified even if it is at the ‘extensive’ level on the condition that the nominated target is important enough. Although civilian casualties are ‘regrettable and tragic consequences of the war’, those losses do not ‘in themselves establish liability … under international law’ as stated by the Eritrea-Ethiopia Claims Commission.\nExcessiveness cannot be determined by approaching it as a mathematical formula, despite the fact that ‘[f]ifty civilians killed for one suspected combatant’ is given as a ‘textbook example of a violation of the proportionality principle’ by some authors. However, as stated in the NATO Bombing Report:\nIt is much easier to formulate the principle of proportionality in general terms than it is to apply it to a particular set of circumstances because the comparison is often between unlike quantities and values. One cannot easily assess the value of innocent human lives as opposed to capturing a particular military objective.\nHence, excessiveness should be evaluated depending upon the comparison between two values, namely, collateral damage and military advantage. Although it is hard to estimate excessiveness in cyberspace and to prevent it, there are methods to make a reasonable assessment. It is stated in the Allied Doctrine that:\nCOs [cyberspace operations] will be conducted according to the operation plan. As such, SCEPVA [Sovereign Cyber Effects Provided Voluntarily by Allies], when authorised, might give the commander alternative options to create effects. These options are integrated,\n.

At this point, the determination of the effects and excessiveness of an action will be based on the good faith of the combatant, its reasonableness and the circumstances in which the cyber attack is planned and executed.\n## 3.4 Effective warning\nIt is stated in Article 57(2)(c) of the AP-I that ‘effective advance warning shall be given of attacks which may affect the civilian population, unless circumstances do not permit’. The first appearance of this rule can be traced back to the Lieber Code, in which it was stated that:\nCommanders, whenever admissible, inform the enemy of their intention to bombard a place, so that the noncombatants, and especially the women and children, may be removed before the bombardment commences. But it is no infraction of the common law of war to omit thus to inform the enemy. Surprise may be a necessity.\nAs it can be observed from the article, if a party plans to conduct a surprise cyber attack, it does not need to give any warning so as not to endanger the success of the operation. Surprise may be necessary in some cases, such as when there is a risk of a pre-emptive cyber attack or the exposure of a broader campaign. The Tallinn Manual illustrates this by saying that:\nConsider, for example, a cyber operation involving placement of a kill-switch into the target computer’s control system, to be activated on the occurrence of some future event or after the passage of a specified period. A warning that would give the enemy an opportunity to locate and neutralise the device need not be given.\nTherefore, giving warning is limited to appropriate circumstances since an attacker may have special reasons that justify not giving any warning. A relevant consideration could be the equation comparing the level of military advantage between situations in which giving occurs and those in which it does not. If the gap justifies civilian harm, then the attacking party does not need to give a warning in advance.\nIf it is expected that the cyber attack will exclusively affect civilian objects and not have any impact on civilians, then giving warning will not be necessary. By approving this point, the Australian Military Manual states that the warning can be directed at civilians, who bear the dangers posed by an intended attack, or at responsible authorities. In that vein, if harm to civilians is expected, then they can be warned in many ways through\n. NATO (fn 59) 26 para 3.32 (explanations added).\n.

There is no necessity to issue a warning in a formal way. If it is effective, it can be conveyed by any means that are available to the attacking party, such as in a written or verbal way. Sending voice recordings or text messages through WhatsApp, for instance, might be a feasible precaution if it is deemed to be effective.\nThe term ‘effective’ is not clarified, neither in the AP-I nor in its commentary. Even though the Australian Military Manual suggests adopting ‘commonsense’ to achieve effectiveness, this does not clarify the notion but adds extra blurriness to it. On the other hand, the term ‘effective’ is defined in the dictionary as ‘producing a decided, decisive, or desired effect’. Based on this definition, it can at least be said that in order for a warning to be effective, it should aim to reduce collateral damage to a minimum. To accomplish this, the content of the warning should be reasonably clear and specific so that civilians have a chance to secure themselves from the effects of an attack. Both of these terms should be determined based on the context. In terms of clarity, rather than giving technical details, belligerent parties may underline the effects of cyber attacks and provide guidelines to civilians on how to protect themselves from such effects. In terms of specificity, there is no requirement to give a specific warning for every situation; the warning may be general in a way that provides a list of cyber objectives that might be targeted. Overall, there is no one correct method to issuing effective warnings, but they should be tailored to diverse scenarios to protect civilians.\nWarnings can be conducted through an enemy if it makes the warning more effective. However, such a warning can also be used as a ruse of war. For example, ‘a false announcement of a cyber attack affecting dual-use systems might prove militarily useful in causing the enemy to take its military assets off-line’. Nevertheless, if it is expected that such a warning causes civilians to ignore future real warnings and to put them in danger, then this will be prohibited. Further, the belligerent party should not give a warning in order to spread terror among civilians. As stated in Article 51(2) of the AP-I, ‘[a]cts or threats of violence the primary purpose of which is to spread terror among the civilian population are prohibited’. For this reason, warnings given through cyberspace that aim to ‘frighten or cause panic among residents or compel them to leave their homes for reasons other than their safety’ are forbidden. Although there is always a danger for civilians to be exposed to fake news via the Internet without the knowledge of the attacking party, it is also their obligation to search for the truth.\n194.

Therefore, this rule is also known as ‘the lesser of two evils’. The rationale behind the article is simple: While a commander is trying to get the maximum effect on the military capacity of the enemy, he/she should seek an option which has minimum effect on civilians. The example given in the Official Commentary is that ‘[i]nstead of attacking railway stations, which are usually located in towns, the railway lines were hit at crucial points, but away from inhabited areas; the same action was taken with respect to roads’. By analogy, it can be stated that cyber attacks should be conducted against specific networks of electricity distribution facilities rather than the whole power station. However, the rule comes into scene when two different options promise military advantage at the same level. Otherwise, the attack is subject to other provisions and principles, i.e., proportionality.\nThere are two critical discussions to have while inflicting the least amount of harm on civilians and civilian property. First, whether or not causing harm to civilians and civilian property is equally important. At this point, while discussing the Kosovo Conflict, General Clark states that ‘[w]e weren’t going to disregard risks to civilians but the alternative to taking risks with property damage was that we might ultimately have to put our troops in on the ground’. From this example, it seems that objects have less value than civilian lives in practice. However, cyber operations are more likely to have effects on objects than on people. Therefore, the relevant discussion may be whether all objects have the same value in cyberspace. At this point, Henderson offers to determine the value of objects by various factors such as ‘the “utility” of the object, the objects “replace-ability”, and the cost of replacement’. In that vein, in terms of utility, it may be preferable to have an impact on financial records rather than medical data in cyberspace. The second discussion is whether belligerent parties put civilians at greater risk than their own troops. Although some states and scholars adopt the opinion that the security of armed forces should be included in military advantage, another approach holds that the armed forces must accept the risks posed by combat actions, and those risks should not be borne by civilians. The present author considers that an attacking party who conducts cyber attacks against an enemy already minimizes the dangers of combat for its own troops because of their remoteness\n.

Therefore, it should not disregard civilian damage by claiming force protection.\nBeyond mere humanitarianism, it is a military reality to target legitimate objectives to the maximum extent while harming civilians to the minimum. Carnahan states that '[t]he wise military officer will try to concentrate firepower on key military objectives and to keep to a minimum the collateral damage not only for humanitarian reasons, but also because munitions that injure civilians are wasted munitions'.[214] When the humanitarian impacts of such 'wasted munitions' are considered along with their military value, it is a well-known fact that when civilian harm increases, the likelihood of success of the mission decreases, so belligerent parties should aim to put the least amount of risk on civilians if there is an opportunity to refrain from it while gaining a military advantage at the same level, or at least another option that significantly decreases the military advantage.[215]\n# 4 PRECAUTIONS AGAINST THE EFFECTS OF CYBER OPERATIONS\n## 4.1 General remarks\nIt is stated in Article 58 of the AP-I that:\nThe Parties to the conflict shall, to the maximum extent feasible:\n(a) without prejudice to Article 49 of the Fourth Convention, endeavour to remove the civilian population, individual civilians and civilian objects under their control from the vicinity of military objectives;\n(b) avoid locating military objectives within or near densely populated areas;\n(c) take the other necessary precautions to protect the civilian population, individual civilians and civilian objects under their control against the dangers resulting from military operations.\nThe rationale behind the article is to abstain from 'defensive tactics that unnecessarily increases civilian risk' by endangering civilians and civilian objects to the detrimental effects of military operations.[216] For this reason, belligerent parties should segregate their military objectives from civilians and civilian objectives; if this is not possible, they should at least protect these people and objects from the effects of cyber operations.[217]\nThe rule is applicable within the territory of the belligerent party, which is responsible for the protection of its nationals or people under its control.[218] However, this territorial application of the rule may pose a significant hurdle in cyberspace. Although it was claimed that 'all civilian cyber infrastructure and activities located in territory under the control of a party to the conflict are subject to this Rule', this approach cannot be applicable in cyberspace since it is almost impossible to control every civilian activity in this domain.[219] This follows a risk that a responsible government may claim\n214.

At this point, the term ‘control’ refutes such a defence by obligating the party to protect civilians and civilian property by segregating civilian computer systems if it has a capacity to control these systems. As a result, this obligation should not be applied by taking territorial concerns into account but rather by considering whether or not these systems are under the de facto control of a party.\nThese precautions are applicable as soon as they are ‘to the maximum extent feasible’. Although the term ‘feasible’ was explained in the first chapter, the Official Commentary further clarifies this term by noting that those measures should ‘not go beyond the point where the life of the population would become difficult or even impossible’. Also, the Tallinn Manual explains the term ‘maximum extent’ in a way that it ‘emphasises the importance of taking the requisite measures’. According to one approach, those measures can be applied depending upon ‘the requirements of national defence’ as stated in the declaration of Austria. From this perspective, parties do not need to expose all of their military facilities, or to put them in a more dangerous position by considering the dictations of the national defence. This is explained in Official Records by the delegation of the Republic of Korea with the following words:\n[T]his provision does not constitute a restriction on a State’s military installations on its own territory. We consider that military facilities necessary for a country’s national defence should be decided on the basis of the actual needs and other considerations of that particular country. An attempt to regulate a country’s requirements and the fulfilment of those requirements in this connexion would not conform to actualities.\nThis is a valid argument since, as described in the first chapter, the principle of precautions obligates parties to take measures when they are ‘practicable or practically possible’. For this reason, every country has to take precautions against the effects of cyber attacks within its own limits.\nWhile the term ‘constant care’ is not explicitly stated in the article, it is still a valid consideration which should be taken into account in order to alleviate risks to civilians and civilian property. At this point, Corn points three reasons why constant care should be taken in both active and passive precautions: First, there is no clear line between ‘attacking’ and ‘defending’ parties in terms of operational art since every armed force needs to conduct both types of operations in the conflict. Second, ‘constant care’ obliges all parties of an armed conflict to conduct their operations by taking civilian harm into account as well as seeking to gain military advantage. This obligation cannot be confined to the attacking party. Third, the exclusion of defending\n220. Jensen (fn 58) 214–15.\n221. Ibid.\n222.

When the nature of cyberspace is taken into account, the obligation becomes more important than conventional warfare since the domain has many more complexities than other areas.\nThese measures are similarly sampled in the ICRC Challenge Report and the Tallinn Manual while discussing feasible precautions against the effects of cyber attacks:\n[S]egregating military from civilian cyber infrastructure; segregating computer systems on which critical civilian infrastructure depends from the Internet; backing up important civilian data; making advance arrangements to ensure the timely repair of important computer systems; digitally recording important cultural or spiritual objects to facilitate reconstruction in the event of their destruction; and using anti-virus measures to protect civilian systems that might suffer damage or destruction during an attack on military cyber infrastructure.\nThis is not an exhaustive list, and every situation may require different precautions to be taken.\n## 4.2 The segregation of civilian networks\nAs it is indicated above, Article 58(a) of the AP-I requires parties to ‘endeavour to remove the civilian population, individual civilians and civilian objects under their control from the vicinity of military objectives’. The obligation should be applied when there is an immediate danger to civilians, and they should be evacuated them from the territory ‘where the risk of attack is greatest’. Even if this measure brings some difficulty to civilians, it aims to protect them from greater suffering, and alternative accommodations should be provided. If these measures are not achieved, this can be deemed forced displacement and a violation of international law.\nWhilst the rule seems applicable when traditional battlefield is taken into account, it still creates some problems. For example, the rule was opposed by Switzerland because of its geographical conditions, where most civilians live in valleys in which important military facilities are located due to the limited number of useful locations in the country, so it becomes very hard to segregate civilians and civilian objects from the proximity of these facilities. The same hardship is applicable for some facilities that can be important for both civilians and military personnel, such as air traffic control centres and power generation plants.\nOn the other hand, the application of the rule in cyberspace brings more difficulty than in traditional domains. Civilian infrastructures are used for almost all cyber operations, and most of them have a dual nature. As an example, how can civilians be removed from cloud technology, which is also used for military purposes? Nevertheless, it is argued in a legal assessment published by the US Department of Defence that ‘[w]here there is a choice … military systems should be kept separate from\n.

For example, parties to the conflict can build a separate cyber infrastructure in which only military communications travel through it, and locate dual-use cyber infrastructures separate from civilians. Although it can be claimed that situations may arise in which civilian and military networks cannot be segregated, state practice has started to follow a different pathway. It is stated by Walker that:\nIn cyberspace, State practice, particularly that of the United States, makes clear that it is feasible to separate purely military objectives from civilian objectives, at least up to a point. The United States military uses multiple, dedicated networks to conduct administrative, logistical and operational activities. The three best-known networks are the Non-Classified Internet Protocol Router Network (NIPRnet, which carries information classified up to and including Sensitive but Unclassified), Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRnet, which carries data classified up to and including the Secret level) and the Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communication System (JWICS carries data classified up to and including Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information).\nAs this example clearly shows, it is imperative to segregate the different types of networks, even if it can be costly. Otherwise, if the object makes an effective contribution and the segregation cannot be established, then the whole cyber infrastructure would be a lawful target.\nGovernmental and civilian data can be stored in the public cloud, despite the fact that this does not literally satisfy the criteria for segregation. However, the Russia-Ukraine War proved its usefulness in terms of reducing cyber dangers. The Ukrainian government moved an important part of the state’s digital infrastructure to the public cloud in preparation for Russian cyber operations against its governmental data center. In this sense, cloud technology turns the disadvantage of cyber infrastructure’s interconnectedness into an advantage. As a more advanced example, the Estonian government established a ‘data embassy’ whose ‘resources are under Estonian state control, secured against cyberattacks or crisis situations with KSI [Keyless Signature Infrastructure] Blockchain technology, and are capable not only providing data backups, but also operating the most critical services’. The particular advantage of such precautions compared with network segregation is that they protect civilian data not only from cyber attacks but also from other types of crises that might occur within states’ borders, such as natural disasters or kinetic attacks.\nIf such precautions impose a significant burden on the belligerent and are not feasible solutions, belligerent parties should search for other ways to shield civilian\n236.

The pertinent precaution could be the establishment of ‘digital safe havens’ through agreements between belligerent parties; while some systems may be difficult to negotiate due to their potential assistance to the adversary’s military effort, other systems critical to civilian life may be easily agreed upon.\n## 4.3 The location of military objectives\nIt is stated in Article 58(b) of the AP-I that belligerent parties should ‘avoid locating military objectives within or near densely populated areas’. From this perspective, parties to the conflict should refrain from locating both movable and immovable objects close to densely populated areas in order to protect civilians under their control. Nevertheless, the rule should not be limited to densely populated areas but also include ‘hospitals, cultural property, places of worship, prisoner of war camps, and other facilities which are entitled to specific protection’ by refraining from locating cyber military objectives in or around them.\nWhile the applicability of the rule is understood in a physical sense, and social media or other similar civilian websites ‘cannot be equated with densely populated areas’, the rule obliges parties to take measures by considering cyber infrastructures which are physically located in the territory of a party. Therefore, for instance, army cyber commands should not be located in places where civilians or special protected objects can be put in danger. However, there is a significant hurdle to locating defence ministries in a place which is not close to densely populated areas. On the other hand, it is still possible for parties to exclude these kinds of facilities, which are military in nature but almost impossible to locate in isolated places, from the ambit of the attack through negotiation. Even if they cannot be attacked, it is possible for a party to conduct disruptive cyber operations against cyber infrastructures in these facilities. At this point, cyber operations give a unique opportunity to parties not to harm civilians but to still have an impact on the military capacity of their enemies.\n## 4.4 Other passive measures\nAs it is stated above, belligerent parties should ‘take the other necessary precautions to protect the civilian population, individual civilians and civilian objects under their control against the dangers resulting from military operations’ according to Article 58(c) of the AP-I. While there is no limit on the scope of the rule, the Official Commentary states that this rule should be applied to civilians by providing them with protective shelters, as well as to specially protected objects by providing trained personnel to limit damage to them. However, conflicting parties should take all feasible precautions by taking the gap-filling function of Article 58(c) into account.\n. Tallinn Manual Rule 121 Cmt. para 10.\n.

However, there are some measures which are applicable to cyberspace by analogy. For example, civilians might be supported by providing them with software products such as anti-virus programs that limit the damage from cyber attacks, detecting civilian cyber systems in order to warn people in case of intrusion attempts, providing them technical assistance when their computer systems are harmed, providing a back-up system to store civilian data, blocking particular IP addresses which pose risks to civilian systems, and keeping ready a system that makes it possible to disconnect an entire country from the Internet when all measures are exhausted.\nWhile the title of Article 58 includes ‘attacks’, paragraph (c) clearly states that some precautions should be applied to operations. Although Jensen admits the ambiguity of this situation, he argues that countries which are not parties to the AP-I have responsibility arising from this provision for those acts that reach ‘attack’ threshold. In the Tallinn Manual, even though the majority of experts stated that the rule is applicable only to cyber attacks because of the title of the article and the non-existence of customary law, the minority focused on the wording of paragraph (c) by accepting cyber operations within the ambit of this rule. Therefore, the minority view kept the threshold lower, determined disruptive operations to be covered by this rule, and obligated parties to take precautions against the effects of these operations. However, both parties have a common understanding on the non-application of the rule to ‘mere inconvenience or irritation’.\nThere is no clear-cut answer on which precautions should be taken within the ambit of Article 58(c), since the provision serves as a gap-filler in the article. Despite the fact that it did not receive much attention in the past because the suitability of other provisions for kinetic activities made them more visible than paragraph (c), their relative unsuitability for cyber operations rendered this clause more important. At this point, the implementation of the norm in cyberspace has already begun to be shaped by the practices of both state and non-state actors, and this trend seems to be continuing and getting better. For example, the US government has begun to warn private entities when they are subjected to transborder cyber attacks and has provided them with cyber tools and training to combat those attacks. Furthermore, the Security Service of Ukraine informs civilians about cyber threats and what measures to take in order to avoid them. As a recent innovative example, the ICRC has been conducting research on creating a ‘digital emblem’ for the past two years in order to enable the identification of objects, systems, or networks that cannot be subject to cyber attacks. Lastly, even though these are individual precautionary measures, the Russia-Ukraine War has also demonstrated how state and non-state entities can collaborate to\n251.

The Microsoft Report highlights two examples of cyber security measures against Russian cyber activities:\nThe first has been the use of technology acquired from RiskIQ that identifies and maps organizational attack surfaces, including devices that are unpatched against known vulnerabilities and therefore are the most susceptible to attack. This information has been shared with the Ukrainian government free of charge to enable it to accelerate the strengthening of cyber-defenses. Ukrainian network defenders worked tirelessly with the constant support of the CERT UA within the government to use this information to protect computers across the country.\nThe second measure has been a wartime innovation pursued with the collaboration and support of the Ukrainian government. MSTIC recognized that Russian malware could be mitigated meaningfully by turning on a feature in Microsoft Defender called controlled folder access. This typically would require that IT administrators access devices across their organization, work made more difficult and potentially even dangerous in wartime conditions. The Ukrainian government therefore authorized Microsoft through special legal measures to act proactively and remotely to turn on this feature across devices throughout the government and across the country.\nEvery effort having a purpose to minimize collateral damage is desired in cyberspace; the principle of precaution essentially relies on the processes but not the results.\n# 5 CONCLUSION\nNew technologies have changed the nature of armed conflict significantly, and this process increasingly continues. As one kind of these technologies, cyber operations have introduced significant challenges to the LOAC, but the most unique one is their capability to have a wide range of effects because of the interconnectedness of cyberspace. This article has endeavoured to determine the application of the principle of precautions to cyber operations by tilting the principle towards humanity by considering the natures of both the principle and cyberspace.\nFrom the standpoint of the principle of precautions, the Russia-Ukraine War exemplified an important phenomenon: public-private cooperation against adversarial cyber operations. Unlike traditional domains, private entities have a partial but critical level of control over cyberspace, and as a result of this distinctive feature of the current conflicts, the Ukrainian government collaborated with a technology giant, Microsoft. This collaboration is emphasized in the Microsoft Report by stating that:\n[U]nlike the traditional threats of the past, cyber defenses rely on a unique level of public and private collaboration. The evolving threat landscape requires a whole-of-society approach. The private sector, particularly technology companies, are on the front lines of cyber and information attacks. Likewise, civil society organizations are key conveners that play a crucial role in engagement, sometimes are involved in cyber data analysis, and are often targets of these campaigns themselves.\nBringing non-public entities into the equation in cyberspace, thereby putting more civilians in the balance, would enhance the ‘civilianization’ of armed conflicts, and this would inherently lean the principle of precaution on the side of humanity.\n.

To solve this problem, one should deem Article 57(4) as ‘merely a restatement of one of the existing rules’.⁴⁶ As Article 49(3) makes clear, the article does not affect those rules that are customary in nature and applicable to all types of military operations. Therefore, Article 57(4) does not contradict but rather ‘complement’ it.⁴⁷ Since the principle of precautions applies to both operations and attacks, both of these terms should be clarified. At this point, military operations are ‘any movements, manoeuvres and other activities whatsoever carried out by the armed forces with a view to combat’.⁴⁸ Therefore, all parties to the conflict should exercise constant care while conducting their military operations. For instance, if a tank driver harms civilian property while maneuvering the vehicle, he/she will be responsible due to the breach of the principle of precautions.⁴⁹ From this perspective, if a perpetrator destroys a civilian network while conducting cyber exploitation against either a civilian or military cyber system, he/she will bear responsibility. However, military attacks require a certain threshold since they are violent acts causing death, injury, damage, or destruction – or at least intending to do so.⁵⁰ As a result, all military attacks are kinds of military operations but vice versa would not be true. Therefore, while cyber operation can be defined as ‘the employment of cyber capabilities to achieve objectives in or through cyberspace’,⁵¹ cyber attack is ‘a cyber operation, whether offensive or defensive, that is reasonably expected to cause injury or death to persons or damage or destruction to objects’.⁵² In light of this, cyber attack is a special kind of cyber operation that results in violent effects. However, cyber attacks require a broader understanding because damage to objects may occur as a secondary effect of cyber operations. Therefore, the present author agrees with the approach of the majority of the International Group of Experts (the Experts), who prepared the Tallinn Manual, that cyber operations that result in the replacement of a component by having an impact on the functionality of an object fall within the ambit of attack because, while these kinds of operations do not damage an object in the first instance, their effects in later phases reach the threshold of attack by causing physical harm.⁵³ ⁴⁵.

At this point, the applicability of international law to cyber operations is recognized by states and international organizations.⁵⁵ Also, there is a certain difference between a cyber operation and an attack, and not all precautionary measures are applicable to all kinds of cyber operations. ## 2.2 Constant care According to Article 57(1) of the AP-I, the attacking party shall always take ‘constant care’ to spare civilians and civilian objects while conducting military operations. The term ‘constant care’ is clarified in the HPCR Manual Commentary by stating that ‘there are no exceptions from the duty to seek to spare the civilian population, civilians and civilian objects’.⁵⁶ Therefore, constant care obliges all levels of the armed forces who are responsible for planning, ordering or executing a cyber operation to always consider the results of it and try to minimize its effects on civilians.⁵⁷ The ‘constant care’ obligation is necessary for cyber operations. Those who are involved in the operation should always be aware of the foreseeable effects of operations on the civilian population and property and try to minimize these effects as much as possible. For this reason, it is not enough to demonstrate due care in the planning stage; this obligation extends to all stages of the operation in which civilians might be affected. In other words, these people should have ‘situational awareness at all times’.⁵⁸ The concept of situational awareness is explained in the Allied Joint Doctrine for Cyberspace Operations by describing it as ‘a combination of a near real-time updated RCP [Recognised Cyberspace Picture], analysis and information management’.⁵⁹ Although the obligation is constrained by the execution stage of an operation as described in the article, the effects of the attack can continue.

On the other hand, the application of the rule in cyberspace poses a significant hurdle since almost all cyber operations might affect or harm civilian cyber infrastructure to some extent.⁶² However, after all feasible precautions have been taken by an attacker, the relevant rule will be proportionality. If the effects of the operation on civilians are not excessive compared to the anticipated military advantage, then the attacking party may continue to carry out cyber operations. However, the calculation may be difficult because of the time-sensitivity. Planned operations give more chance to the attacking party to take better precautions, though time-sensitive ones generally do not permit sufficient time to implement more suitable precautions.⁶³ Although the impact of such a condition on precautions is not deniable, it does not give permission to the attacker to deviate from the principle because the constant care obligation necessitates parties to take feasible precautions in all circumstances.⁶⁴ The second significant hurdle might be the secretive nature of cyberspace since ambiguity is at the centre of cyber warfare.⁶⁵ Even though attribution may be difficult in that domain and the perpetrator of cyber acts that violate the LOAC cannot be easily found, parties to the conflict should obey the rules of the LOAC by considering warrior ethics. From this perspective, cyber warriors should always seek ways to mitigate risks towards civilians in good faith since ‘[r]espect for LOAC obligations is the essential touchstone for that ethical foundation’.⁶⁶ This ethical foundation serves for better protection of civilians, which is an inherent objective of the LOAC.⁶⁷ Last but not least, the ‘constant care’ obligation should not be accepted as limited to this article. It involves all phases of operations and attacks, which are carried out by both attacking and defending parties. For this reason, it has a guidance function while examining all provisions of Articles 57 and 58. ## 2.3 Feasibility Article 57 obliges parties to take ‘feasible’ precautions in order to minimize the effects of an attack on civilians and civilian objects. In the Official Commentary of Article 57, it is stated that those precautions are ‘everything that was practicable or practically possible, taking into account all the circumstances at the time of the attack, including ⁶⁰.

Parties to the conflict do not need to take 'perfect' precautions; it is enough to take precautions that are practically possible under circumstances ruling at the time.70 That is why feasibility should be determined on a contextual basis. At this point, every situation has its unique features, and those responsible for an attack should adapt various precautions by considering the characteristics of the situation. For example, an attacker party should map the target network through exploitation operations if it is connected to other civilian networks.71 In such situations, LOAC not only permits cyber espionage but also obligates a belligerent party to conduct these operations. However, such operations require a certain level of technical expertise, and in the absence of that, such a network should not be exploited.72 Despite such expertise, some mistakes may occur in the 'fog of war'.73 At this point, a commander who took 'all due measures' is not responsible for this harm.74 Those measures can be identified by different factors such as available cyber means, time sensitivity, the cyber defence system of the enemy, the characteristics of the target, intelligence assets, the expertise of the attacking team, the loyalty of the enemy of to the LOAC, and available assets and vulnerabilities of the enemy.75 However, even if feasible precautions are taken, unintended results may occur for various reasons, such as failure of the intelligence system, dysfunction of the technology, or unexpected changes in tactical conditions.76 For instance, a commander might prepare a map of a cyber network before conducting an attack, but the virus unintentionally spreads among the civilian infrastructure, which has a connection with the military network.77 At this point, while deciding on whether the principle of precautions is respected or not, one should not focus on outcomes, but compliance should be measured by the process in which an"

In the same vein, various authors claimed that conducting military operations without having a doubt on the nature of a target is not a reasonable expectation in the fog of war.¹¹⁸ From this perspective, there is always some doubt as an inherent characteristic of combat. On the other hand, the present author thinks that the Official Commentary should be interpreted as the aim of a commander. By stating the ‘slight doubt’ requirement, the commentary obligates them to take better precautions even if it is possible to erase this doubt. This is approved by military practice, in which attacks are cancelled when combatants are not ‘certain’¹¹⁹ or ‘100 percent sure of their aiming point’.¹²⁰ According to Parks, the US achieved this level of accuracy during the Linebacker II campaign by constantly confirming the nature of targets, implementing rules set by the Strategic Air Command, and issuing bomb damage assessments after each attack.¹²¹ Despite the fact that such high-level precautions sometimes pose substantial risks to the combatants’ lives, he acknowledges that they are important not only in terms of legality but also for achieving military and political objectives.¹²² By considering such positive outcomes, a commander should be sure enough that he/she made reasonable efforts to verify the nature of the target in cyberspace.¹²³"

However, despite its practical importance, the principle of precautions seems to trail behind the other two concepts.¹ This negligence extends not only to scholarly works but also to military doctrines. While the first two principles are often referred to as ‘principles’ in military manuals, the third does not have such a privilege.² Nonetheless, it not only confirms or supplements these former principles but also prescribes some preliminary measures to avoid violating them.³\nOn the other hand, the Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC) rules, which regulate the application of the principle of precautions, were designed to be applied during conventional warfare. Due to the interconnected nature of the cyber domain, however, it is difficult to apply these rules to cyber operations. Before discussing the complexity posed by the interconnectivity of cyberspace, it should be admitted that it is not unique to the cyber domain; traditional domains have this problem too. Almost half a century ago, the reality that there is ‘a geographical and functional mixture of combatants and civilians and military objectives and civilian objects’ in the conduct of military air\n1.

From the first standpoint, technical factors intensify the interconnectedness between military and civilian networks in cyberspace, therefore converting this domain into one of entirely dual-use nature and obstructing the distinction between military targets and civilian objects. As Jensen points out, ‘[w]ith 98% of day-to-day government communications routinely travelling over civilian communication lines, there will be many civilian lines of communication that will carry targetable electronic traffic intermixed with civilian traffic’.⁶ From this vantage point, not only is it highly difficult to make a certain distinction between civilian and military cyber infrastructures, but practically all military cyber activities must be carried out through dual-use cyber systems.⁷ In the absence of precautionary measures against such interconnectivity, the impacts of cyber activities might quickly spread to other systems across the globe and have the potential to significantly disrupt daily civilian life by having adverse impacts on civilian critical infrastructure and other associated systems.⁸ From this point of view, a cyber operation designed to disrupt a dual-used power plant located in a belligerent state could easily impair other systems, from water and food to ICT infrastructure, and its unintended effects might spill over into neutral countries.⁹\nFrom the second point of view, interconnection becomes a more complicated matter when social factors are considered. Even though they are less obvious than technical ones, they still pose threats comparable to those of the latter, and it necessitates especially defensive parties to take unique precautionary measures. Therefore, it has been\n4. US Department of the Air Force, AF Pamphlet 110-31: International Law – The Conduct of Armed Conflict and Air Operations (1976) 5–10.\n5.

This perspective would reveal just how many components are connected and demonstrate the levels of complexity in a facility’.¹⁰ This entails that the human workforce of a facility needs to be considered in terms of the complexity of the system’s network. When this fact about a single facility is considered along with the global challenge of interconnectivity, the magnitude of the interconnectivity issue could be better understood.\nGiven that measures to prevent adversarial effects on cyber systems cannot keep up with their level of interconnectivity,¹¹ this article aims to portray how to apply the principle of precautions to cyber operations and answers this question by taking its humanity-based character into account. The present author acknowledges that the articles articulating the principle of precautions are vague, as stated by state delegates during the negotiations of Additional Protocol-I or by state legal advisers.¹² Such views on specific provisions of the article or the article as a whole are expressed using terms like ‘open to a variety of interpretations by the conflicting parties’¹³ (for Article 57(2)(a)(ii)), ‘subjective’¹⁴ ‘ambiguous’¹⁵ (for Article 57(2)(a)), ‘deficient in clarity due to its generally vague wording’¹⁶ (for Article 57), and ‘too general’¹⁷ (for articles between 48 and 58). Moreover, delegates emphasized the hardships posed by applying these provisions in practice.¹⁸ When the complexity of cyberspace interconnectivity is combined with the ambiguity of the articles, applying the principle of precautions appears to bring together two ‘unknown unknowns’ in order to reach one ‘known known’.¹⁹ Throughout this piece of research, the author attempts to emphasize the humanity-based character of the principle of precautions in order to convert this ambiguity into a flexibility to apply the rules more effectively.²⁰\nThe LOAC, in general, aims to achieve a balance between military necessity and humanity.²¹ From this perspective, it is accepted that some harm will occur; on the\n10.

For example, Sari and Tinkler think that achieving a balance between humanity and necessity in the conduct of hostilities can be held ‘as the object and purpose of Additional Protocol I\n© 2023 The Author\nJournal compilation © 2023 Edward Elgar Publishing Ltd\nDownloaded from https://www.elgaronline.com/ at 07/16/2025 08:36:46PM\nvia University College London (UCL)\nThe application of the principle of precautions to cyber operations 7\nother hand, it should be minimized as much as possible. In other words, ‘[t]he thrust is not absolute elimination of the calamities of war (a goal which would manifestly be utopian), but relief from the tribulations of war “as much as possible” bearing in mind that war is fought to be won’.²² At this point, it sounds rational that these two notions should be balanced while applying the principles governing the conduct of hostilities.\nOn the other hand, considering the peculiarity of interconnectedness in cyberspace, this balance should be leaned toward humanity while applying the principle of precautions. There are some reasons in favour of such an interpretation. To begin with, the notion of ‘balance’ is significantly subjective.²³ From a practitioner perspective, when the armed conflict starts, reality does not permit such a compromise,²⁴ and the perception of ‘balance’ is determined by those on the battlefield. However, outside of the conflict, such a balance could be perceived differently by scholars or judges who need to evaluate the legality of such actions, and their views seem more ‘humanitarian’ to practitioners. As stated by Luban, ‘[f]or military lawyers, the starting point is military necessity, and the reigning assumption is that legal regulation of war must accommodate military necessity. For humanitarian lawyers, the starting point is human dignity and human rights’.²⁵ As a result, such disparities in viewpoints considerably alter the perception of balance, and trying to achieve a balance in the principle of precautions seems to be a rhetorical word.\nApart from the subjectivity of balance depending on different perceptors, the nature of the LOAC principles inherently provides a lean toward either military necessity or humanity.²⁶ While the principles of distinction and proportionality are more eligible to\nmore generally’. See A Sari and K Tinkler, ‘Collateral Damage and the Enemy’ (2019) British Yearbook of International Law 63. From the standpoint of this article, military necessity is held as a permission giving to a belligerent party in order to ‘apply any amount and kind of force to compel the complete submission of the enemy with the least possible expenditure of time, life, and money’ by not violating the LOAC. See The Hostage Case, Case No. 7 (United States v. Wilhelm List et al.), (Opinion and Judgment and Sentence)  1253 (‘The Hostage Case’). Pictet defines humanity as ‘a sentiment of active goodwill towards mankind’ by referring to Littré’s dictionary. See J Pictet, The Fundamental Principles of the Red Cross (1956) 143. By considering this definition, this article holds the principle of humanity as a ‘guiding principle that puts a brake on undertakings which might otherwise be justified by the principle of military necessity’.

The crux of the former principles is based on gaining military advantage on the battlefield,²⁷ and the notion of military advantage ‘has a particular resonance with “military necessity”’.²⁸ This naturally bends those principles’ interpretation in the direction of military necessity.²⁹ On the other hand, the central tenet of the principle of precautions is based on the minimization of civilian harm. It obliges belligerent parties to take active or passive precautionary measures to mitigate risks, which derive from military operations, towards civilians and civilian property in armed conflicts.³⁰ In line with this, it is not good enough for soldiers ‘merely not intending civilian harm’, but they also ‘must intend not to harm civilians’.³¹\nGiven that the nature of the principles requires that they be construed by leaning towards one side, analyzing the principle of precautions by considering the balance poses a risk that it turns into an ‘illusory rule’. According to Schwarzenberger:\n[Illusory rules]... are merely a formal compromise between the standard of civilization and the necessities of war. Here, in fact the rule of force is supreme. Rules which expressly proclaim the necessities of war as an overriding constituent element or are emasculated by an ‘as far as possible’ clause illustrate this perhaps slightly hypocritical variant of the rules of warfare.³²\nThus, by turning the principle into an ‘illusory rule’, it would be very easy for belligerent parties to refrain from effectively applying the principle of precautions by putting terms such as ‘feasible’ or ‘unless circumstances do not permit’ on the table.³³ To preclude such excuses, one should hold it as a rule that ‘sets limitations to warfare in cases in which considerations of civilization demand priority over military interest’.³⁴ As correctly held by the Madagascar delegate, ‘[t]he article reflected a laudable desire to narrow the gap between the ideal and the possible, and to deal from a humanitarian standpoint with two opposite positions, namely, the aggressor’s and the victim’s’.³⁵ Per this point of view, the application of the principle of precautions by taking ‘one small step’ toward humanity could be ‘one giant leap’ toward a more appropriate\n²⁷.

When the inherent bending of these principles toward military necessity and only their recognition as ‘principles’ in military manuals are considered, the consequence is admitted by Maurer that ‘[i]n more than one context, the balance between military “necessity” and protection concerns has heavily tilted towards military logics, and norms have been implicitly downgraded to mere discretionary guidance’.

In section 3, the precautions that shall be taken by the attacking side of the conflict according to Article 57 of Additional Protocol-I will be examined. In the first part of the section, target verification in cyber operations will be discussed, and some important questions will be answered, e.g., does technical superiority play any role on the precautionary level? Or what is the requisite level of certainty? In the second part, the choice of cyber means and methods will be addressed. The proportionality rule in precautions in planning and executing cyber attacks will be determined in the third part. Not only will key terms such as ‘military advantage’ and ‘incidental harm’ be discussed in that section, but also some grey areas, e.g., the consideration of indirect effects. The fourth part will explain effective warning before launching cyber attacks, and the final part will explain the least-danger rule. In the fourth section, precautions that shall be taken by a party that is subject to cyber operations will be addressed. In this chapter, the segregation of civilian and military objectives in cyberspace, the location of cyber military objectives, and other measures will be questioned, respectively.\n## 2 THE REGULATION OF THE PRINCIPLE OF PRECAUTIONS, BASIC TERMS AND RESPONSIBILITY\n### 2.1 The regulation of the principle of precautions\nWhile it is not stated conspicuously, the first implication of the principle of precautions can be found in Article 27 of the Hague Convention IV, in which it is stated that:\nIn sieges and bombardments all necessary steps must be taken to spare, as far as possible, buildings dedicated to religion, art, science, or charitable purposes, historic monuments, hospitals, and places where the sick and wounded are collected, provided they are not being used at the time for military purposes.³⁷\nIn the following process, the prohibition to launch an attack against civilians and to spare them as much as possible found a place in various official documents.³⁸ However, the first binding regulation of the principle of precautions appeared in the AP-I,\n³⁶. ‘The principles of distinction, precautions and proportionality thus complement each other in a way that achieves a subtle balance between military necessity and humanitarian imperatives.’ See Sari and Tinkler (fn 21) 4.\n³⁷.

See League of Nations Res ‘Protection of Civilian Populations Against Bombing from the Air in Case of War’ (30 September 1938). Later, more detailed rules were articulated in Articles 8, 9 and 11 of the Draft Rules for the Limitation of the Dangers incurred by the Civilian Population in Time of War (1956). Despite the fact that states did not adopt these rules, they had an impact on the rules codified in Additional Protocols. See S Watts, ‘Law-of-War Precautions: A Cautionary Note’ in RTP Alcala and E Talbot Jensen (eds), The Impact of Emerging Technologies on the Law of Armed Conflict (Oxford University Press, 2019) 116.\n© 2023 The Author\nJournal compilation © 2023 Edward Elgar Publishing Ltd\nDownloaded from https://www.elgaronline.com/ at 07/16/2025 08:36:46PM via University College London (UCL)\nThe Military Law and the Law of War Review, Vol. 61 No. 1\nin which it is stated that both attacking and defending parties shall take precautions to spare civilians and civilian objects in an armed conflict. At this point, for *jus in bello* cyberspace operations, the principle of precautions provides a twofold protection: the first comprises taking constant care while conducting cyber attacks ('precautions in attack'), and the second comprises taking feasible precautions in order to protect civilians from the effects of cyber attacks ('precautions against the effects of attacks') during armed conflicts. These precautions can also be named 'active' and 'passive' precautions ruled under Articles 57 and 58 of the AP-I.\nThe rules stated in Articles 57 and 58 are applied in times of armed conflicts, though the definition of 'armed conflict' is not provided in the Protocol. In this article, the definition given in the Tadic Decision, in which it was described as 'a resort to armed force between States or protracted armed violence between governmental authorities and organized armed groups or between such groups within a State', is adopted. From this definition, it can be stated that there are two types of armed conflicts; 'between States' (international armed conflicts), and 'between governmental authorities and organized armed groups or between such groups' (non-international armed conflicts). In identifying the nature of the conflict, the status of the actors is the decisive factor. The importance of this distinction is that while the AP-I, which is applicable to international armed conflicts, clearly states the obligation to take precautions, there is no clear provision which regulates the principle of precautions in Additional Protocol-II, which is applicable to non-international armed conflicts. However, it does not prevent the application of the principle to the latter type of conflicts since it is stated in Article 13(1) of the AP-II that '[t]he civilian population and individual civilians shall enjoy general protection against the dangers arising from military operations'. Therefore, it is argued in the work of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) on Customary Rules that, by approving the customary nature of the principle for both international and non-international armed conflict, it is hard to abide by such a rule without taking any precaution. Moreover, it is stated in the Tadic Decision that 'all necessary precautions should be taken to avoid injury, loss or damage to civilian populations' in all kinds of armed conflicts by referring to a resolution adopted by the United Nations General Assembly. Finally, two recent treaties that are applicable to non-international armed conflicts explicitly regulate the principle of precautions.\n39. Prosecutor v.

To solve this problem, one should deem Article 57(4) as ‘merely a restatement of one of the existing rules’.⁴⁶ As Article 49(3) makes clear, the article does not affect those rules that are customary in nature and applicable to all types of military operations. Therefore, Article 57(4) does not contradict but rather ‘complement’ it.⁴⁷\nSince the principle of precautions applies to both operations and attacks, both of these terms should be clarified. At this point, military operations are ‘any movements, manoeuvres and other activities whatsoever carried out by the armed forces with a view to combat’.⁴⁸ Therefore, all parties to the conflict should exercise constant care while conducting their military operations. For instance, if a tank driver harms civilian property while maneuvering the vehicle, he/she will be responsible due to the breach of the principle of precautions.⁴⁹ From this perspective, if a perpetrator destroys a civilian network while conducting cyber exploitation against either a civilian or military cyber system, he/she will bear responsibility. However, military attacks require a certain threshold since they are violent acts causing death, injury, damage, or destruction – or at least intending to do so.⁵⁰ As a result, all military attacks are kinds of military operations but vice versa would not be true. Therefore, while cyber operation can be defined as ‘the employment of cyber capabilities to achieve objectives in or through cyberspace’,⁵¹ cyber attack is ‘a cyber operation, whether offensive or defensive, that is reasonably expected to cause injury or death to persons or damage or destruction to objects’.⁵² In light of this, cyber attack is a special kind of cyber operation that results in violent effects. However, cyber attacks require a broader understanding because damage to objects may occur as a secondary effect of cyber operations. Therefore, the present author agrees with the approach of the majority of the International Group of Experts (the Experts), who prepared the Tallinn Manual, that cyber operations that result in the replacement of a component by having an impact on the functionality of an object fall within the ambit of attack because, while these kinds of operations do not damage an object in the first instance, their effects in later phases reach the threshold of attack by causing physical harm.⁵³\n⁴⁵.

At this point, the applicability of international law to cyber operations is recognized by states and international organizations.⁵⁵ Also, there is a certain difference between a cyber operation and an attack, and not all precautionary measures are applicable to all kinds of cyber operations.\n## 2.2 Constant care\nAccording to Article 57(1) of the AP-I, the attacking party shall always take ‘constant care’ to spare civilians and civilian objects while conducting military operations. The term ‘constant care’ is clarified in the HPCR Manual Commentary by stating that ‘there are no exceptions from the duty to seek to spare the civilian population, civilians and civilian objects’.⁵⁶ Therefore, constant care obliges all levels of the armed forces who are responsible for planning, ordering or executing a cyber operation to always consider the results of it and try to minimize its effects on civilians.⁵⁷\nThe ‘constant care’ obligation is necessary for cyber operations. Those who are involved in the operation should always be aware of the foreseeable effects of operations on the civilian population and property and try to minimize these effects as much as possible. For this reason, it is not enough to demonstrate due care in the planning stage; this obligation extends to all stages of the operation in which civilians might be affected. In other words, these people should have ‘situational awareness at all times’.⁵⁸ The concept of situational awareness is explained in the Allied Joint Doctrine for Cyberspace Operations by describing it as ‘a combination of a near real-time updated RCP [Recognised Cyberspace Picture], analysis and information management’.⁵⁹ Although the obligation is constrained by the execution stage of an operation as described in the article, the effects of the attack can continue.

If the effects of the operation on civilians are not excessive compared to the anticipated military advantage, then the attacking party may continue to carry out cyber operations. However, the calculation may be difficult because of the time-sensitivity. Planned operations give more chance to the attacking party to take better precautions, though time-sensitive ones generally do not permit sufficient time to implement more suitable precautions.⁶³ Although the impact of such a condition on precautions is not deniable, it does not give permission to the attacker to deviate from the principle because the constant care obligation necessitates parties to take feasible precautions in all circumstances.⁶⁴\nThe second significant hurdle might be the secretive nature of cyberspace since ambiguity is at the centre of cyber warfare.⁶⁵ Even though attribution may be difficult in that domain and the perpetrator of cyber acts that violate the LOAC cannot be easily found, parties to the conflict should obey the rules of the LOAC by considering warrior ethics. From this perspective, cyber warriors should always seek ways to mitigate risks towards civilians in good faith since ‘[r]espect for LOAC obligations is the essential touchstone for that ethical foundation’.⁶⁶ This ethical foundation serves for better protection of civilians, which is an inherent objective of the LOAC.⁶⁷\nLast but not least, the ‘constant care’ obligation should not be accepted as limited to this article. It involves all phases of operations and attacks, which are carried out by both attacking and defending parties. For this reason, it has a guidance function while examining all provisions of Articles 57 and 58.\n## 2.3 Feasibility\nArticle 57 obliges parties to take ‘feasible’ precautions in order to minimize the effects of an attack on civilians and civilian objects. In the Official Commentary of Article 57, it is stated that those precautions are ‘everything that was practicable or practically possible, taking into account all the circumstances at the time of the attack, including\n⁶⁰.

At this point, every situation has its unique features, and those responsible for an attack should adapt various precautions by considering the characteristics of the situation. For example, an attacker party should map the target network through exploitation operations if it is connected to other civilian networks.71 In such situations, LOAC not only permits cyber espionage but also obligates a belligerent party to conduct these operations. However, such operations require a certain level of technical expertise, and in the absence of that, such a network should not be exploited.72 Despite such expertise, some mistakes may occur in the 'fog of war'.73 At this point, a commander who took 'all due measures' is not responsible for this harm.74 Those measures can be identified by different factors such as available cyber means, time sensitivity, the cyber defence system of the enemy, the characteristics of the target, intelligence assets, the expertise of the attacking team, the loyalty of the enemy of to the LOAC, and available assets and vulnerabilities of the enemy.75 However, even if feasible precautions are taken, unintended results may occur for various reasons, such as failure of the intelligence system, dysfunction of the technology, or unexpected changes in tactical conditions.76 For instance, a commander might prepare a map of a cyber network before conducting an attack, but the virus unintentionally spreads among the civilian infrastructure, which has a connection with the military network.77 At this point, while deciding on whether the principle of precautions is respected or not, one should not focus on outcomes, but compliance should be measured by the process in which an\n68.

Therefore, it is permitted for the military commander in the Naval Manual of Ecuador to use alternative methods ‘in light of all the facts known or reasonably available to him, including the need to conserve resources and complete the mission successfully’.⁸¹ However, if it is understood that using less advanced weapons will result in excessive collateral damage, then they should either use advanced ones or cancel the attack.⁸²\nOn the other hand, the determination of feasibility on a contextual basis should not be used to assuage the burden from the shoulders of the attacker. For example, the use of white phosphorus shells near al-Wafa hospital, where patients have serious injuries and need long-term care, by the Israeli armed forces was deemed a violation of Articles 57(2)(b) and (c) of the AP-I.⁸³ It was stated that those who were responsible for the attack should be aware of ‘all the facts and circumstances’.⁸⁴ For this reason, while conducting a cyber operation against a system in which some medical records may be located, the attacking party should take special care. The same is valid for facilities such as dams, where dangerous forces are located.⁸⁵\n## 2.4 Responsibility\nThe wording of Article 57 restricts its applicability to ‘those who plan or decide upon an attack’. Because of this wording, some states have expressed reservations about Article 57, claiming that it only applies to ‘commanding officers at the battalion or group level and those of higher ranks’.⁸⁶ Nonetheless, every soldier who breaches obligations imposed by the LOAC bears individual criminal responsibility for his/her acts when such crimes are committed with ‘intent and knowledge’.⁸⁷ At this point, it does\n⁷⁸.

The reason is that volumetric attacks can end up using all available channel capacity, which would affect the networks on the path to the target. This has happened in the past, with powerful DDoS attacks launched against specific targets and affecting entire internet infrastructure providers.⁹⁵\nHowever, the unpredictability of effects does not relieve the responsibility of all levels of command while conducting operations. According to Watkin, operational factors cannot be put forward in order not to take feasible precautions in today’s trend, which pursues to compromise ‘human rights-like accountability frameworks with operational decision making during armed conflict’.⁹⁶ Accordingly, all members of the armed forces who are part of operations in cyberspace should do everything feasible within their limits.\nWhile assessing the individual responsibility of officers, they should be judged by how much they know about a certain subject. The well-known example is the Rendulic Decision, in which the Nuremberg Tribunal held that ‘the “scorched earth” policy in\n⁸⁸ Sandoz, Swinarski and Zimmermann (eds) (fn 3) 2197; APV Rogers, ‘General Report-Conduct of Combat and Risks Run by the Civilian Population’ (1982) 21 Mil.

For this reason, later evidence which showed that ‘the danger did not actually exist’$^{98}$ cannot be used to convict the commander since he ‘acted within the limits of honest judgment on the basis of the conditions prevailing at the time’.$^{99}$ This is crucial considering the interconnectivity of cyberspace since cyber attacks might affect civilian networks unexpectedly despite a commander’s employment of the advanced technology to conduct constant surveillance over a network.$^{100}$ At this point, the responsibility arising out of a cyber attack would not go beyond what the defendant knew at the time of the attack.\nOn the other hand, one needs to distinguish misinformation from misconception. Misconception of the nature of the target might occur because of cognitive bias, which misdirects attackers by analyzing information ‘in a manner that supports their pre-existing beliefs or mental frameworks’.$^{101}$ States should employ a variety of techniques such as ‘training and education, red teaming procedures, specific positive identification (PID) policies for targeting, use of structured analytic techniques, and other analytic tradecraft practices’ in order for this not to result in civilian damage.$^{102}$ Despite the fact that states are keen to protect soldiers in such situations,$^{103}$ inflicting civilian harm due to biased decisions does not very well fit with the notion of ‘honest judgement’.\nLastly, those who undertake cyber operations may be fully aware of the results of their actions owing to their technical expertise since cyberspace requires unique understanding compared to traditional domains. If a higher commander issues an order to launch a cyber operation without being aware of the outcomes in good faith, inferior commanders will be responsible for such intentional conduct. However, if a commander is aware that he lacks sufficient information about a target, he should either change the concept of the attack or refrain from issuing such an order.$^{104}$ Should an operation continue to be carried out while being aware of this insufficiency, responsibility arises.\n# 3 PRECAUTIONS IN ATTACK\n## 3.1 Target verification\nIt is stated in Article 57(2) of the AP-I that:\n(a) those who plan or decide upon an attack shall:\n(i) do everything feasible to verify that the objectives to be attacked are neither civilians nor civilian objects and are not subject to special protection but are military objectives within the\n97.

For this reason, an object that is military in nature should not be subject to attack if it does not effectively contribute to the military capacity of an enemy.^^\nWhile only Article 52(2) of the AP-I has found its place in the provision, lawful targets also include people who can be made the object of direct cyber attacks. According to the LOAC, various categories of people can be held as lawful targets. The first one consists of combatants who are members of the armed forces and have a right to directly participate in hostilities.^^ Even though they are lawful targets, they have a right to be treated as prisoners of war when they are captured by the enemy.^^\nThe second category includes direct participants in hostilities. Although they are civilian in nature, they will be accepted as lawful targets if they meet three cumulative criteria which are: threshold of harm, direct causation and belligerent nexus.^^ Those people are lawful targets 'for such time as they take a direct part in hostilities',^^ and if they are captured, they cannot benefit from prisoner of war status.\nThe third category, though there is a discussion on it, consists of members of an organized armed group that is a belligerent party in an armed conflict. They are 'individuals whose continuous function involves the preparation, execution, or command of acts or operations amounting to direct participation in hostilities'.^^\n105.

In the same vein, various authors claimed that conducting military operations without having a doubt on the nature of a target is not a reasonable expectation in the fog of war.¹¹⁸ From this perspective, there is always some doubt as an inherent characteristic of combat. On the other hand, the present author thinks that the Official Commentary should be interpreted as the aim of a commander. By stating the ‘slight doubt’ requirement, the commentary obligates them to take better precautions even if it is possible to erase this doubt. This is approved by military practice, in which attacks are cancelled when combatants are not ‘certain’¹¹⁹ or ‘100 percent sure of their aiming point’.¹²⁰ According to Parks, the US achieved this level of accuracy during the Linebacker II campaign by constantly confirming the nature of targets, implementing rules set by the Strategic Air Command, and issuing bomb damage assessments after each attack.¹²¹ Despite the fact that such high-level precautions sometimes pose substantial risks to the combatants’ lives, he acknowledges that they are important not only in terms of legality but also for achieving military and political objectives.¹²² By considering such positive outcomes, a commander should be sure enough that he/she made reasonable efforts to verify the nature of the target in cyberspace.¹²³\n113.

At this point, cyber attack should be limited to that component, which is military in nature.¹²⁴ If it is not possible, then the attack should be cancelled. However, this should not be equated with being ‘perfectly familiar with the network’¹²⁵ since such an interpretation is not appropriate with the term ‘feasible’.\n## 3.2 Choice of cyber means and methods\nAfter the nature of the target is verified, the next step will be to compose an operational plan that will have a minimum effect on civilians. At this point, it is stated in Article 57 (2)(a)(ii) of the AP-I that members of the armed forces should ‘take all feasible precautions in the choice of means and methods of attack with a view to avoiding, and in any event to minimising, incidental loss or civilian life, injury to civilians and damage to civilian objects’. This means that even if an attack is proportionate, parties to the conflict should be careful in their choice of means and methods in order to minimize the effects of attacks as much as possible while still aiming to obtain maximum military advantage. At this point, an attacking party should produce a plan that promises to give the most efficient operational and legal results.¹²⁶\nIt is important to define ‘cyber means’ and ‘methods’. Cyber means are defined as ‘cyber weapons and their associated cyber systems’¹²⁷ in the Tallinn Manual. At this point, cyber weapons are kinds of cyber means, but the latter includes a broader category. Cyber methods, on the other hand, are defined as ‘the cyber tactics, techniques, and procedures by which hostilities are conducted’.¹²⁸ Whilst cyber means are concerned with which tools should be employed to carry out cyber operations, cyber methods are concerned with how these operations should be carried out.¹²⁹ Based on this viewpoint, while botnets are a type of cyber means, the DDoS attack that is conducted by botnets can be considered a type of cyber method.¹³⁰\nThere is no weapon or method that is specifically prohibited in the provision. It only obliges parties to take feasible precautions by choosing appropriate means and methods; thereby, a commander will not be responsible for causing civilian harm. However, the rule does not require parties to choose means and methods that may decrease their expected military advantage.¹³¹ Even if alternative means and methods are not used because of this concern, a planned cyber attack must abide by other principles such as distinction and proportionality.¹³² On the other hand, if choosing different means and methods may change the degree of damage by producing ‘equivalent effects’ upon the target, then alternative means or methods shall be selected.¹³³ A facility where armed forces of a belligerent party conduct cyber attacks against the enemy,\n¹²⁴.

However, this may result in civilian deaths who live in the vicinity of the facility. At this point, if an attacking party has available means to conduct a cyber attack, it shall use them against the system or computers in the facility to stop belligerent attacks. Additionally, military personnel’s expertise with those new technologies is crucial. The concern was raised in the Eritrea-Ethiopia Claims Commission. Even though Eritrea refused Ethiopia’s allegations that some of its aircraft intentionally attacked civilians, the inexperience of Eritrean pilots in using ‘computerized aiming systems’, which led to the failure to target military objectives, was held as a violation of Article 57 of the AP-I.¹³⁴ Lastly, a ‘target list’ can be prepared and constantly reviewed by belligerent parties in order to determine which type of weapon should be used to decrease civilian harm by considering the characteristics of the target.¹³⁵ For example, the bombardment of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) compound by the Israeli Armed Forces, which resulted in extensive damage and endangered the lives of many civilians, was accepted as reckless conduct and a violation of Article 57(2)(a)(ii) of the AP-I since it was executed while being aware of its importance for civilians.¹³⁶ However, in the Vietnam War, the US employed fragmentation bombs that had limited effects on the target to execute attacks against anti-aircraft batteries; since these batteries were located inside dikes, the army tried to refrain from damaging them.¹³⁷\nThe accuracy and range of weapons also have a particular importance in the execution of attacks.¹³⁸ If a target can be destroyed by accurate weapons, then it does not make sense to use dumb bombs or other means whose effects may not be calculated properly or limited. In this sense, the US practice in the Linebacker II campaign is important. During the campaign, the B-52s that have wide-range effects were employed because of weather conditions and the limited number of the more precise weapons.¹³⁹ But to keep the collateral damage to a minimum, the B-52s were used against targets that were either sufficiently large or in military-industrial complexes.¹⁴⁰ Other objectives requiring pinpoint strikes, such as bridges and railroad yards, were hit by more precise weapons when weather conditions permitted, which was limited to 12 hours during the 12-day campaign.¹⁴¹\nAs such practice in a highly interconnected battle arena demonstrates, cyber means and weapons should be used against adversaries while always considering their accuracy and range. When it would not be possible to precisely damage a cyber target that is interconnected with a civilian network, they should be used against military cyber networks, or at least those networks whose destruction does not have a significant impact on civilians. In this manner, a cyber mean can be designed to affect only a specific type of system, as it was in the Stuxnet incident, in which malware only affected the SCADA systems.\n¹³⁴.

That attack used ‘wormable’ destructive malware that could jump from one computer domain to another and hence cross borders into other countries. Russia has been careful in 2022 to confine destructive ‘wiper software’ to specific network domains inside Ukraine itself. But the recent and ongoing destructive attacks themselves have been sophisticated and more widespread than many reports recognize. And the Russian army is continuing to adapt these destructive attacks to changing war needs, including by coupling cyberattacks with the use of conventional weapons.¹⁴⁵\nThis passage raises two concerns. First, which types of cyber means are used? Second, excluding other considerations such as political or military ones, why did the Russians allegedly employ such means in an armed conflict while adhering to the LOAC?\nAs an answer to the first question, the Microsoft Report lists cyber means that were used or are in use in the Russia-Ukraine War:\n1. WhisperGate/WhisperKill\n2. FoxBlade, aka HermeticWiper\n3. DesertBlade\n4. CaddyWiper\n5. Lasainraw, aka IsaacWiper\n6. FiberLake, aka DoubleZero\n7. SonicVote, aka HermeticRansom\n8.

This brings an important issue to the surface. Even though the debate exists, operations causing such damage do not constitute attacks in terms of *lex lata*. Therefore, it would not be possible to apply Article 57 (2)(a)(ii) to those malwares since the rule encompasses means of warfare that are ‘used, designed, or intended to be used to conduct a cyber attack’.¹⁴⁸ Then the question would be why Russia needs to employ such discriminatory cyber means.\nFrom the present author’s perspective, the war demonstrated that the key benefit of using cyber means in warfare is their adaptability, instead of previous assumptions that cyber operations provide a belligerent party an advantage owing to their low cost or non-attributability. As stated in the report, Russia adapted such means to ‘changing war needs’.¹⁴⁹ This adaptation should be seen from two perspectives: cyber and kinetic. The former is important from a technical standpoint, and the latter is important from a legal standpoint, but both of them need to be examined because of their importance from a military standpoint.\nEven though it does not have a direct relationship with the legality of cyber means in terms of Article 57(2)(a)(ii), the technical standing point is important to understand why parties adopt cyber means in armed conflicts. Every new step in technology has the potential to threaten the kinetic weapon supremacy of an adversary. For example, the invention of a new type of surface-to-air missile system can erase the advantage of the adversary’s aircraft, and the attacking party needs to make a huge investment to improve its aircraft and produce new ones to establish a new squadron. On the other hand, the adaptability of cyber means makes it possible for past used malware to escape from such quick elimination. By adding some extra codes, a cyber weapon can be adjusted based on a new type of cyber security measure, and such modification can turn it into a new type of weapon. As stated by the ICRC, ‘it is possible for offensive cyber capabilities to be reverse-engineered or repurposed so that they can be reused. This is also the case for some traditional weapon systems, but the technical characteristics of cyberspace raise these concerns in a unique manner’.¹⁵⁰ This uniqueness has been and continues to be demonstrated in the Russia-Ukraine War. Numerous reports claim that Russia used or is using malware by modifying previously used ones. In other words, cyber security updates also bring updates to those malwares, and they are adapted to changing needs in the cyber environment. For example, AcidRain, a wiper malware used to disrupt the VIASAT satellite, shares some characteristics with VPNFilter, a kind of malware used by Russia-backed cyber-organized groups in 2018.¹⁵¹ Also, such modifications do not have to take a long time. Shortly after the intrusion of WhisperGate into Ukrainian systems and its detection by cyber security companies, Russia altered it and developed a new type of malware, Hermeticwiper, that ‘has some similarities to the earlier WhisperGate’.¹⁵² This shows that detecting malware and taking defensive measures against it do not make such malware useless, but certain parts of the codes can still be used by belligerents to improve their cyber capabilities owing to their adaptability.\n¹⁴⁸.

Figure 1 above, depicted by Microsoft, shows how critical infrastructures are subject to cyber operations as the Russian tanks roll toward cities. Additionally, the fact that certain facilities, which are being physically attacked, were subject to cyber operations, demonstrates that the coordination is not general but rather as specific as possible. As a result, every operation that is part of an attack has to be evaluated within the meaning of the LOAC, and this necessitates evaluating the cyber means stated above to be employed by respecting relevant rules, including the principle of precautions.\nWhile choosing cyber methods, the first relevant factor is the timing of the attack to minimize collateral damage. During World War II, Allied Forces conducted attacks on military factories at times when there were a minimum number of civilian workers present. In that vein, for example, while carrying out cyber attacks against dual-use objects, the belligerent party may execute them at night or early in the morning when the targets are not intensively used by civilians.\n153.

If a target is located in a place that is mostly used by civilians and there is a significant level of risk of harm occurring, the attacker shall use the most accurate weapons available or must refrain from conducting such an attack.¹⁵⁶ At this point, there is a discussion on whether the Internet can be held as a lawful target because, while it might make an effective contribution to the military capacity of the enemy, it is mostly used by civilians. Even though it is argued that if an attacking party believes that it can get enough military advantage, a cyber attack against the Internet is permissible,¹⁵⁷ another opinion accepts the Internet as a civilian object and prohibits such an attack.¹⁵⁸ According to the latter opinion, even if it is intended to carry out a cyber attack against the Internet, it should be limited to ‘individual networks, servers, routers, links, and other computer facilities that are used for military purposes and which are likely to be connected to the Internet’.¹⁵⁹ By accepting the latter interpretation, the present author considers that if it is possible to considerably limit the effects of the attack, especially by considering the dual nature of cyberspace, then an attack may be conducted. If not, it will be in breach of the rule.\nWhilst some authors argue that the choice of means and methods only come onto the scene when there is a similar advantage,¹⁶⁰ the present author thinks that the criteria should not be applied strictly. As stated by Borghard and Lonergan while discussing coercion in cyberspace, the attacking party tries to apply less harmful ways, such as disruptive operations rather than destructive ones, in order to better negotiate at later stages since the system may be restored more easily when the former type of means are used.¹⁶¹ At this point, the belligerent party should choose the type of means or methods to achieve the intended outcomes by considering the post-conflict situation.¹⁶² There is no doubt that a large number of civilian deaths will prolong the conflict, even if the attacks are perfectly legal. The bombing of Radio-Television of Serbia by NATO, which sparked so many debates about the legality of the campaign, may be an example of the adverse impact of such conduct. To Kolb, even if the station can be assumed as a military objective, it was repaired in three hours, and 16 civilians were killed because of the attack.¹⁶³ By taking lessons from this example, it can be stated that belligerent parties should always consider alternatives, even if a designed cyber attack seems lawful. In such a case, disrupting broadcasting by cyber operation might produce better consequences, even though it seems that destruction promises more advantage. In these kinds of situations, perpetrators should always keep the humanitarian aims of the LOAC in mind.\n¹⁵⁶.

However, both of these provisions have similar meanings by prohibiting attacks conducted against a legitimate target if it seems that ‘excessive’ collateral damage will occur, whether the cyber attack is being planned or has already been planned.¹⁶⁴ At this point, there should be a balance between military advantage and civilian harm.\n## 3.3.1 Military advantage\nThe advantage should be military in nature rather than merely moral, political or financial.¹⁶⁵ For example, conducting cyber attacks against specific sectors of a country, such as the oil industry, which is vital for Arab countries, by considering that such an operation against ‘war-sustaining objects’ will decrease the military effort of an enemy is not appropriate since ‘almost every civilian activity might be construed by the enemy as indirectly sustaining the war effort’ as stated by Dinstein.¹⁶⁶ Also, it is stated in the Official Commentary that this type of advantage can only be gained by the annihilation of an enemy or gaining ground; the transformation of the notion of war, however, changed this paradigm.¹⁶⁷ While the former can be categorized as an overstatement, the latter seems to be an understatement. Hence, as a moderate approach, the HPCR Manual Commentary points out that ‘any consequence of an attack which directly enhances friendly military operations or hinders those of the enemy’¹⁶⁸ should be included within the ambit of military advantage.\nCyber attacks should be assessed as a whole while aiming to obtain military advantage.¹⁶⁹ As stated by Fenrick and approved by declarations of numerous states, proportionality calculations cannot be made on either ‘a bullet-by-bullet basis’ or ‘the basis of attacks on individual military objectives’.¹⁷⁰ Furthermore, when the army launches concerted or coordinated cyber attacks, it may be impossible or impractical for every\n¹⁶⁴.

Although it was claimed that people who give an order will bear responsibility rather than those who execute the attack in such a case, if it is apparent that the targeted network is civilian in nature after the attack is initiated, it should be cancelled or a confirmation should be demanded by the perpetrator from higher ranks in light of changing circumstances.¹⁷² Lastly, assessing a cyber attack as a whole should not be interpreted as having a purpose to obtain military advantage by taking the ‘full context of a war strategy’ into account.¹⁷³ Otherwise, all cyber attacks, whether they incur excessive civilian damages or not, can be deemed legal in defiance of the aims of the LOAC.\n## 3.3.2 Collateral damage\nCollateral damage can be described as an ‘incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians and damage to civilian objects or other protected objects or a combination thereof, caused by an attack on a lawful target’.¹⁷⁴ At this point, collateral damage occurs while conducting cyber attacks against military targets without deliberately targeting civilians and civilian property.\nCollateral damage includes both the direct and indirect effects of a cyber attack. While the former type of effects are those that ‘are the immediate, first order consequence of a military action (weapons employment results, etc.), unaltered by intervening events or mechanisms’;¹⁷⁵ the latter type of effects are ‘the delayed or displaced second-, third-, and higher-order consequences of action, created through intermediate events or mechanisms’.¹⁷⁶ Since cyber operations are carried out at the logical layer of cyberspace, their first-order effects have an impact on data, programs, or software; nevertheless, such effects are not included in the aforementioned definition of collateral damage.¹⁷⁷ Yet, ‘indirect effects may be aimed at the other layers of cyberspace, or at creating other higher-order effects in other domains’, and thereby such effects can raise the level of collateral damage.¹⁷⁸ Therefore, the inclusion of indirect effects in the concept of collateral harm is crucial. However, due to the complexity involved in calculating second- or higher-order effects, such an inclusion also poses a significant challenge in cyberspace. As acknowledged in the Allied Doctrine:\nSince cyberspace is a global domain, there is a risk of COs [cyberspace operations] having an impact outside the joint operations area. COs can create undesired effects on our own\n¹⁷¹. Quéguiner (fn 154) 804.\n¹⁷². Ibid at 804–805.\n¹⁷³.

This risk, as with similar risks in other domains, is factored into the planning.¹⁷⁹\nEven though it is not necessary to make certain calculations, effects which are too remote or beyond the scope of reasonable certainty will not cause any responsibility for combatants.¹⁸⁰ Lastly, collateral damage does not contain minor effects such as stress, irritation or inconvenience.¹⁸¹ All cyber attacks might cause stress or inconvenience to some extent, but that does not make them illegal.\n## 3.3.3 Excessive collateral damage\nBelligerent parties should always consider whether the expected military advantage is proportionate compared to the anticipated collateral damage. At this point, the terms ‘extensive’ and ‘excessive’ should be differentiated. In the Official Commentary, it was argued that conducting attacks against lawful targets should not create ‘extensive destruction of civilian objects’¹⁸² despite the fact that there is no reference to such a limitation in the Additional Protocols. The collateral damage can be justified even if it is at the ‘extensive’ level on the condition that the nominated target is important enough. Although civilian casualties are ‘regrettable and tragic consequences of the war’, those losses do not ‘in themselves establish liability … under international law’ as stated by the Eritrea-Ethiopia Claims Commission.¹⁸³\nExcessiveness cannot be determined by approaching it as a mathematical formula, despite the fact that ‘[f]ifty civilians killed for one suspected combatant’ is given as a ‘textbook example of a violation of the proportionality principle’ by some authors.¹⁸⁴ However, as stated in the NATO Bombing Report:\nIt is much easier to formulate the principle of proportionality in general terms than it is to apply it to a particular set of circumstances because the comparison is often between unlike quantities and values. One cannot easily assess the value of innocent human lives as opposed to capturing a particular military objective.¹⁸⁵\nHence, excessiveness should be evaluated depending upon the comparison between two values, namely, collateral damage and military advantage. Although it is hard to estimate excessiveness in cyberspace and to prevent it, there are methods to make a reasonable assessment. It is stated in the Allied Doctrine that:\nCOs [cyberspace operations] will be conducted according to the operation plan. As such, SCEPVA [Sovereign Cyber Effects Provided Voluntarily by Allies], when authorised, might give the commander alternative options to create effects. These options are integrated,\n¹⁷⁹.

At this point, the determination of the effects and excessiveness of an action will be based on the good faith of the combatant, its reasonableness and the circumstances in which the cyber attack is planned and executed.\n## 3.4 Effective warning\nIt is stated in Article 57(2)(c) of the AP-I that ‘effective advance warning shall be given of attacks which may affect the civilian population, unless circumstances do not permit’. The first appearance of this rule can be traced back to the Lieber Code, in which it was stated that:\nCommanders, whenever admissible, inform the enemy of their intention to bombard a place, so that the noncombatants, and especially the women and children, may be removed before the bombardment commences. But it is no infraction of the common law of war to omit thus to inform the enemy. Surprise may be a necessity.¹⁸⁷\nAs it can be observed from the article, if a party plans to conduct a surprise cyber attack, it does not need to give any warning so as not to endanger the success of the operation.¹⁸⁸ Surprise may be necessary in some cases, such as when there is a risk of a pre-emptive cyber attack or the exposure of a broader campaign.¹⁸⁹ The Tallinn Manual illustrates this by saying that:\nConsider, for example, a cyber operation involving placement of a kill-switch into the target computer’s control system, to be activated on the occurrence of some future event or after the passage of a specified period. A warning that would give the enemy an opportunity to locate and neutralise the device need not be given.¹⁹⁰\nTherefore, giving warning is limited to appropriate circumstances since an attacker may have special reasons that justify not giving any warning.¹⁹¹ A relevant consideration could be the equation comparing the level of military advantage between situations in which giving occurs and those in which it does not. If the gap justifies civilian harm, then the attacking party does not need to give a warning in advance.\nIf it is expected that the cyber attack will exclusively affect civilian objects and not have any impact on civilians, then giving warning will not be necessary.¹⁹² By approving this point, the Australian Military Manual states that the warning can be directed at civilians, who bear the dangers posed by an intended attack, or at responsible authorities.¹⁹³ In that vein, if harm to civilians is expected, then they can be warned in many ways through\n¹⁸⁶.

Even though the Australian Military Manual suggests adopting ‘commonsense’ to achieve effectiveness, this does not clarify the notion but adds extra blurriness to it.¹⁹⁷ On the other hand, the term ‘effective’ is defined in the dictionary as ‘producing a decided, decisive, or desired effect’.¹⁹⁸ Based on this definition, it can at least be said that in order for a warning to be effective, it should aim to reduce collateral damage to a minimum. To accomplish this, the content of the warning should be reasonably clear and specific so that civilians have a chance to secure themselves from the effects of an attack.¹⁹⁹ Both of these terms should be determined based on the context. In terms of clarity, rather than giving technical details, belligerent parties may underline the effects of cyber attacks and provide guidelines to civilians on how to protect themselves from such effects. In terms of specificity, there is no requirement to give a specific warning for every situation; the warning may be general in a way that provides a list of cyber objectives that might be targeted.²⁰⁰ Overall, there is no one correct method to issuing effective warnings, but they should be tailored to diverse scenarios to protect civilians.\nWarnings can be conducted through an enemy if it makes the warning more effective.²⁰¹ However, such a warning can also be used as a ruse of war. For example, ‘a false announcement of a cyber attack affecting dual-use systems might prove militarily useful in causing the enemy to take its military assets off-line’.²⁰² Nevertheless, if it is expected that such a warning causes civilians to ignore future real warnings and to put them in danger, then this will be prohibited.²⁰³ Further, the belligerent party should not give a warning in order to spread terror among civilians.²⁰⁴ As stated in Article 51(2) of the AP-I, ‘[a]cts or threats of violence the primary purpose of which is to spread terror among the civilian population are prohibited’. For this reason, warnings given through cyberspace that aim to ‘frighten or cause panic among residents or compel them to leave their homes for reasons other than their safety’ are forbidden.²⁰⁵ Although there is always a danger for civilians to be exposed to fake news via the Internet without the knowledge of the attacking party, it is also their obligation to search for the truth.\n194.

Therefore, this rule is also known as ‘the lesser of two evils’.²⁰⁶ The rationale behind the article is simple: While a commander is trying to get the maximum effect on the military capacity of the enemy, he/she should seek an option which has minimum effect on civilians. The example given in the Official Commentary is that ‘[i]nstead of attacking railway stations, which are usually located in towns, the railway lines were hit at crucial points, but away from inhabited areas; the same action was taken with respect to roads’.²⁰⁷ By analogy, it can be stated that cyber attacks should be conducted against specific networks of electricity distribution facilities rather than the whole power station.²⁰⁸ However, the rule comes into scene when two different options promise military advantage at the same level.²⁰⁹ Otherwise, the attack is subject to other provisions and principles, i.e., proportionality.\nThere are two critical discussions to have while inflicting the least amount of harm on civilians and civilian property. First, whether or not causing harm to civilians and civilian property is equally important. At this point, while discussing the Kosovo Conflict, General Clark states that ‘[w]e weren’t going to disregard risks to civilians but the alternative to taking risks with property damage was that we might ultimately have to put our troops in on the ground’.²¹⁰ From this example, it seems that objects have less value than civilian lives in practice. However, cyber operations are more likely to have effects on objects than on people. Therefore, the relevant discussion may be whether all objects have the same value in cyberspace. At this point, Henderson offers to determine the value of objects by various factors such as ‘the “utility” of the object, the objects “replace-ability”, and the cost of replacement’.²¹¹ In that vein, in terms of utility, it may be preferable to have an impact on financial records rather than medical data in cyberspace. The second discussion is whether belligerent parties put civilians at greater risk than their own troops. Although some states and scholars adopt the opinion that the security of armed forces should be included in military advantage,²¹² another approach holds that the armed forces must accept the risks posed by combat actions, and those risks should not be borne by civilians.²¹³ The present author considers that an attacking party who conducts cyber attacks against an enemy already minimizes the dangers of combat for its own troops because of their remoteness\n²⁰⁶.

Therefore, it should not disregard civilian damage by claiming force protection.\nBeyond mere humanitarianism, it is a military reality to target legitimate objectives to the maximum extent while harming civilians to the minimum. Carnahan states that '[t]he wise military officer will try to concentrate firepower on key military objectives and to keep to a minimum the collateral damage not only for humanitarian reasons, but also because munitions that injure civilians are wasted munitions'. When the humanitarian impacts of such 'wasted munitions' are considered along with their military value, it is a well-known fact that when civilian harm increases, the likelihood of success of the mission decreases, so belligerent parties should aim to put the least amount of risk on civilians if there is an opportunity to refrain from it while gaining a military advantage at the same level, or at least another option that significantly decreases the military advantage.\n# 4 PRECAUTIONS AGAINST THE EFFECTS OF CYBER OPERATIONS\n## 4.1 General remarks\nIt is stated in Article 58 of the AP-I that:\nThe Parties to the conflict shall, to the maximum extent feasible:\n(a) without prejudice to Article 49 of the Fourth Convention, endeavour to remove the civilian population, individual civilians and civilian objects under their control from the vicinity of military objectives;\n(b) avoid locating military objectives within or near densely populated areas;\n(c) take the other necessary precautions to protect the civilian population, individual civilians and civilian objects under their control against the dangers resulting from military operations.\nThe rationale behind the article is to abstain from 'defensive tactics that unnecessarily increases civilian risk' by endangering civilians and civilian objects to the detrimental effects of military operations. For this reason, belligerent parties should segregate their military objectives from civilians and civilian objectives; if this is not possible, they should at least protect these people and objects from the effects of cyber operations.\nThe rule is applicable within the territory of the belligerent party, which is responsible for the protection of its nationals or people under its control. However, this territorial application of the rule may pose a significant hurdle in cyberspace. Although it was claimed that 'all civilian cyber infrastructure and activities located in territory under the control of a party to the conflict are subject to this Rule', this approach cannot be applicable in cyberspace since it is almost impossible to control every civilian activity in this domain. This follows a risk that a responsible government may claim\n214.

Although the term ‘feasible’ was explained in the first chapter, the Official Commentary further clarifies this term by noting that those measures should ‘not go beyond the point where the life of the population would become difficult or even impossible’.²²² Also, the Tallinn Manual explains the term ‘maximum extent’ in a way that it ‘emphasises the importance of taking the requisite measures’.²²³ According to one approach, those measures can be applied depending upon ‘the requirements of national defence’ as stated in the declaration of Austria.²²⁴ From this perspective, parties do not need to expose all of their military facilities, or to put them in a more dangerous position by considering the dictations of the national defence.²²⁵ This is explained in Official Records by the delegation of the Republic of Korea with the following words:\n[T]his provision does not constitute a restriction on a State’s military installations on its own territory. We consider that military facilities necessary for a country’s national defence should be decided on the basis of the actual needs and other considerations of that particular country. An attempt to regulate a country’s requirements and the fulfilment of those requirements in this connexion would not conform to actualities.²²⁶\nThis is a valid argument since, as described in the first chapter, the principle of precautions obligates parties to take measures when they are ‘practicable or practically possible’. For this reason, every country has to take precautions against the effects of cyber attacks within its own limits.\nWhile the term ‘constant care’ is not explicitly stated in the article, it is still a valid consideration which should be taken into account in order to alleviate risks to civilians and civilian property.²²⁷ At this point, Corn points three reasons why constant care should be taken in both active and passive precautions:²²⁸ First, there is no clear line between ‘attacking’ and ‘defending’ parties in terms of operational art since every armed force needs to conduct both types of operations in the conflict. Second, ‘constant care’ obliges all parties of an armed conflict to conduct their operations by taking civilian harm into account as well as seeking to gain military advantage. This obligation cannot be confined to the attacking party. Third, the exclusion of defending\n220. Jensen (fn 58) 214–15.\n221. Ibid.\n222.

When the nature of cyberspace is taken into account, the obligation becomes more important than conventional warfare since the domain has many more complexities than other areas.\nThese measures are similarly sampled in the ICRC Challenge Report and the Tallinn Manual while discussing feasible precautions against the effects of cyber attacks:\n[S]egregating military from civilian cyber infrastructure; segregating computer systems on which critical civilian infrastructure depends from the Internet; backing up important civilian data; making advance arrangements to ensure the timely repair of important computer systems; digitally recording important cultural or spiritual objects to facilitate reconstruction in the event of their destruction; and using anti-virus measures to protect civilian systems that might suffer damage or destruction during an attack on military cyber infrastructure.²²⁹\nThis is not an exhaustive list, and every situation may require different precautions to be taken.\n## 4.2 The segregation of civilian networks\nAs it is indicated above, Article 58(a) of the AP-I requires parties to ‘endeavour to remove the civilian population, individual civilians and civilian objects under their control from the vicinity of military objectives’. The obligation should be applied when there is an immediate danger to civilians, and they should be evacuated them from the territory ‘where the risk of attack is greatest’.²³⁰ Even if this measure brings some difficulty to civilians, it aims to protect them from greater suffering, and alternative accommodations should be provided.²³¹ If these measures are not achieved, this can be deemed forced displacement and a violation of international law.\nWhilst the rule seems applicable when traditional battlefield is taken into account, it still creates some problems. For example, the rule was opposed by Switzerland because of its geographical conditions, where most civilians live in valleys in which important military facilities are located due to the limited number of useful locations in the country, so it becomes very hard to segregate civilians and civilian objects from the proximity of these facilities.²³² The same hardship is applicable for some facilities that can be important for both civilians and military personnel, such as air traffic control centres and power generation plants.²³³\nOn the other hand, the application of the rule in cyberspace brings more difficulty than in traditional domains. Civilian infrastructures are used for almost all cyber operations, and most of them have a dual nature.²³⁴ As an example, how can civilians be removed from cloud technology, which is also used for military purposes?²³⁵ Nevertheless, it is argued in a legal assessment published by the US Department of Defence that ‘[w]here there is a choice … military systems should be kept separate from\n²²⁹.

The United States military uses multiple, dedicated networks to conduct administrative, logistical and operational activities. The three best-known networks are the Non-Classified Internet Protocol Router Network (NIPRnet, which carries information classified up to and including Sensitive but Unclassified), Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRnet, which carries data classified up to and including the Secret level) and the Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communication System (JWICS carries data classified up to and including Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information).²³⁹\nAs this example clearly shows, it is imperative to segregate the different types of networks, even if it can be costly.²⁴⁰ Otherwise, if the object makes an effective contribution and the segregation cannot be established, then the whole cyber infrastructure would be a lawful target.²⁴¹\nGovernmental and civilian data can be stored in the public cloud, despite the fact that this does not literally satisfy the criteria for segregation. However, the Russia-Ukraine War proved its usefulness in terms of reducing cyber dangers. The Ukrainian government moved an important part of the state’s digital infrastructure to the public cloud in preparation for Russian cyber operations against its governmental data center.²⁴² In this sense, cloud technology turns the disadvantage of cyber infrastructure’s interconnectedness into an advantage. As a more advanced example, the Estonian government established a ‘data embassy’ whose ‘resources are under Estonian state control, secured against cyberattacks or crisis situations with KSI [Keyless Signature Infrastructure] Blockchain technology, and are capable not only providing data backups, but also operating the most critical services’.²⁴³ The particular advantage of such precautions compared with network segregation is that they protect civilian data not only from cyber attacks but also from other types of crises that might occur within states’ borders, such as natural disasters or kinetic attacks.²⁴⁴\nIf such precautions impose a significant burden on the belligerent and are not feasible solutions, belligerent parties should search for other ways to shield civilian\n236.

From this perspective, parties to the conflict should refrain from locating both movable and immovable objects close to densely populated areas in order to protect civilians under their control.²⁴⁷ Nevertheless, the rule should not be limited to densely populated areas but also include ‘hospitals, cultural property, places of worship, prisoner of war camps, and other facilities which are entitled to specific protection’²⁴⁸ by refraining from locating cyber military objectives in or around them.\nWhile the applicability of the rule is understood in a physical sense, and social media or other similar civilian websites ‘cannot be equated with densely populated areas’, the rule obliges parties to take measures by considering cyber infrastructures which are physically located in the territory of a party.²⁴⁹ Therefore, for instance, army cyber commands should not be located in places where civilians or special protected objects can be put in danger. However, there is a significant hurdle to locating defence ministries in a place which is not close to densely populated areas. On the other hand, it is still possible for parties to exclude these kinds of facilities, which are military in nature but almost impossible to locate in isolated places, from the ambit of the attack through negotiation. Even if they cannot be attacked, it is possible for a party to conduct disruptive cyber operations against cyber infrastructures in these facilities. At this point, cyber operations give a unique opportunity to parties not to harm civilians but to still have an impact on the military capacity of their enemies.\n## 4.4 Other passive measures\nAs it is stated above, belligerent parties should ‘take the other necessary precautions to protect the civilian population, individual civilians and civilian objects under their control against the dangers resulting from military operations’ according to Article 58(c) of the AP-I. While there is no limit on the scope of the rule, the Official Commentary states that this rule should be applied to civilians by providing them with protective shelters, as well as to specially protected objects by providing trained personnel to limit damage to them.²⁵⁰ However, conflicting parties should take all feasible precautions by taking the gap-filling function of Article 58(c) into account.\n²⁴⁵.

For example, civilians might be supported by providing them with software products such as anti-virus programs that limit the damage from cyber attacks, detecting civilian cyber systems in order to warn people in case of intrusion attempts, providing them technical assistance when their computer systems are harmed, providing a back-up system to store civilian data, blocking particular IP addresses which pose risks to civilian systems, and keeping ready a system that makes it possible to disconnect an entire country from the Internet when all measures are exhausted.²⁵²\nWhile the title of Article 58 includes ‘attacks’, paragraph (c) clearly states that some precautions should be applied to operations. Although Jensen admits the ambiguity of this situation, he argues that countries which are not parties to the AP-I have responsibility arising from this provision for those acts that reach ‘attack’ threshold.²⁵³ In the Tallinn Manual, even though the majority of experts stated that the rule is applicable only to cyber attacks because of the title of the article and the non-existence of customary law, the minority focused on the wording of paragraph (c) by accepting cyber operations within the ambit of this rule.²⁵⁴ Therefore, the minority view kept the threshold lower, determined disruptive operations to be covered by this rule, and obligated parties to take precautions against the effects of these operations.²⁵⁵ However, both parties have a common understanding on the non-application of the rule to ‘mere inconvenience or irritation’.²⁵⁶\nThere is no clear-cut answer on which precautions should be taken within the ambit of Article 58(c), since the provision serves as a gap-filler in the article. Despite the fact that it did not receive much attention in the past because the suitability of other provisions for kinetic activities made them more visible than paragraph (c), their relative unsuitability for cyber operations rendered this clause more important. At this point, the implementation of the norm in cyberspace has already begun to be shaped by the practices of both state and non-state actors, and this trend seems to be continuing and getting better. For example, the US government has begun to warn private entities when they are subjected to transborder cyber attacks and has provided them with cyber tools and training to combat those attacks.²⁵⁷ Furthermore, the Security Service of Ukraine informs civilians about cyber threats and what measures to take in order to avoid them.²⁵⁸ As a recent innovative example, the ICRC has been conducting research on creating a ‘digital emblem’ for the past two years in order to enable the identification of objects, systems, or networks that cannot be subject to cyber attacks.²⁵⁹ Lastly, even though these are individual precautionary measures, the Russia-Ukraine War has also demonstrated how state and non-state entities can collaborate to\n251.

The Microsoft Report highlights two examples of cyber security measures against Russian cyber activities:\nThe first has been the use of technology acquired from RiskIQ that identifies and maps organizational attack surfaces, including devices that are unpatched against known vulnerabilities and therefore are the most susceptible to attack. This information has been shared with the Ukrainian government free of charge to enable it to accelerate the strengthening of cyber-defenses. Ukrainian network defenders worked tirelessly with the constant support of the CERT UA within the government to use this information to protect computers across the country.\nThe second measure has been a wartime innovation pursued with the collaboration and support of the Ukrainian government. MSTIC recognized that Russian malware could be mitigated meaningfully by turning on a feature in Microsoft Defender called controlled folder access. This typically would require that IT administrators access devices across their organization, work made more difficult and potentially even dangerous in wartime conditions. The Ukrainian government therefore authorized Microsoft through special legal measures to act proactively and remotely to turn on this feature across devices throughout the government and across the country.²⁶⁰\nEvery effort having a purpose to minimize collateral damage is desired in cyberspace; the principle of precaution essentially relies on the processes but not the results.\n# 5 CONCLUSION\nNew technologies have changed the nature of armed conflict significantly, and this process increasingly continues. As one kind of these technologies, cyber operations have introduced significant challenges to the LOAC, but the most unique one is their capability to have a wide range of effects because of the interconnectedness of cyberspace. This article has endeavoured to determine the application of the principle of precautions to cyber operations by tilting the principle towards humanity by considering the natures of both the principle and cyberspace.\nFrom the standpoint of the principle of precautions, the Russia-Ukraine War exemplified an important phenomenon: public-private cooperation against adversarial cyber operations. Unlike traditional domains, private entities have a partial but critical level of control over cyberspace, and as a result of this distinctive feature of the current conflicts, the Ukrainian government collaborated with a technology giant, Microsoft.²⁶¹ This collaboration is emphasized in the Microsoft Report by stating that:\n[U]nlike the traditional threats of the past, cyber defenses rely on a unique level of public and private collaboration. The evolving threat landscape requires a whole-of-society approach. The private sector, particularly technology companies, are on the front lines of cyber and information attacks. Likewise, civil society organizations are key conveners that play a crucial role in engagement, sometimes are involved in cyber data analysis, and are often targets of these campaigns themselves.²⁶²\nBringing non-public entities into the equation in cyberspace, thereby putting more civilians in the balance, would enhance the ‘civilianization’ of armed conflicts, and this would inherently lean the principle of precaution on the side of humanity.\n²⁶⁰.

The interconnectivity problem should be approached from two perspectives, taking into account both the technical and the social factors. From the first standpoint, technical factors intensify the interconnectedness between military and civilian networks in cyberspace, therefore converting this domain into one of entirely dual-use nature and obstructing the distinction between military targets and civilian objects. As Jensen points out, ‘[w]ith 98% of day-to-day government communications routinely travelling over civilian communication lines, there will be many civilian lines of communication that will carry targetable electronic traffic intermixed with civilian traffic’.⁶ From this vantage point, not only is it highly difficult to make a certain distinction between civilian and military cyber infrastructures, but practically all military cyber activities must be carried out through dual-use cyber systems.⁷ In the absence of precautionary measures against such interconnectivity, the impacts of cyber activities might quickly spread to other systems across the globe and have the potential to significantly disrupt daily civilian life by having adverse impacts on civilian critical infrastructure and other associated systems.⁸ From this point of view, a cyber operation designed to disrupt a dual-used power plant located in a belligerent state could easily impair other systems, from water and food to ICT infrastructure, and its unintended effects might spill over into neutral countries.⁹ From the second point of view, interconnection becomes a more complicated matter when social factors are considered. Even though they are less obvious than technical ones, they still pose threats comparable to those of the latter, and it necessitates especially defensive parties to take unique precautionary measures. Therefore, it has been"

This perspective would reveal just how many components are connected and demonstrate the levels of complexity in a facility’.¹⁰ This entails that the human workforce of a facility needs to be considered in terms of the complexity of the system’s network. When this fact about a single facility is considered along with the global challenge of interconnectivity, the magnitude of the interconnectivity issue could be better understood.

See League of Nations Res ‘Protection of Civilian Populations Against Bombing from the Air in Case of War’ (30 September 1938). Later, more detailed rules were articulated in Articles 8, 9 and 11 of the Draft Rules for the Limitation of the Dangers incurred by the Civilian Population in Time of War (1956). Despite the fact that states did not adopt these rules, they had an impact on the rules codified in Additional Protocols. See S Watts, ‘Law-of-War Precautions: A Cautionary Note’ in RTP Alcala and E Talbot Jensen (eds), The Impact of Emerging Technologies on the Law of Armed Conflict (Oxford University Press, 2019) 116. © 2023 The Author Journal compilation © 2023 Edward Elgar Publishing Ltd Downloaded from https://www.elgaronline.com/ at 07/16/2025 08:36:46PM via University College London (UCL) The Military Law and the Law of War Review, Vol. 61 No. 1 in which it is stated that both attacking and defending parties shall take precautions to spare civilians and civilian objects in an armed conflict. At this point, for *jus in bello* cyberspace operations, the principle of precautions provides a twofold protection: the first comprises taking constant care while conducting cyber attacks ('precautions in attack'), and the second comprises taking feasible precautions in order to protect civilians from the effects of cyber attacks ('precautions against the effects of attacks') during armed conflicts. These precautions can also be named 'active' and 'passive' precautions ruled under Articles 57 and 58 of the AP-I. The rules stated in Articles 57 and 58 are applied in times of armed conflicts, though the definition of 'armed conflict' is not provided in the Protocol. In this article, the definition given in the Tadic Decision, in which it was described as 'a resort to armed force between States or protracted armed violence between governmental authorities and organized armed groups or between such groups within a State',[39] is adopted. From this definition, it can be stated that there are two types of armed conflicts; 'between States' (international armed conflicts), and 'between governmental authorities and organized armed groups or between such groups' (non-international armed conflicts). In identifying the nature of the conflict, the status of the actors is the decisive factor.[40] The importance of this distinction is that while the AP-I, which is applicable to international armed conflicts, clearly states the obligation to take precautions, there is no clear provision which regulates the principle of precautions in Additional Protocol-II,[41] which is applicable to non-international armed conflicts. However, it does not prevent the application of the principle to the latter type of conflicts since it is stated in Article 13(1) of the AP-II that '[t]he civilian population and individual civilians shall enjoy general protection against the dangers arising from military operations'. Therefore, it is argued in the work of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) on Customary Rules that, by approving the customary nature of the principle for both international and non-international armed conflict, it is hard to abide by such a rule without taking any precaution.[42] Moreover, it is stated in the Tadic Decision that 'all necessary precautions should be taken to avoid injury, loss or damage to civilian populations' in all kinds of armed conflicts by referring to a resolution adopted by the United Nations General Assembly.[43] Finally, two recent treaties that are applicable to non-international armed conflicts explicitly regulate the principle of precautions.[44]"

However, despite its practical importance, the principle of precautions seems to trail behind the other two concepts.¹ This negligence extends not only to scholarly works but also to military doctrines. While the first two principles are often referred to as ‘principles’ in military manuals, the third does not have such a privilege.² Nonetheless, it not only confirms or supplements these former principles but also prescribes some preliminary measures to avoid violating them.³ On the other hand, the Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC) rules, which regulate the application of the principle of precautions, were designed to be applied during conventional warfare. Due to the interconnected nature of the cyber domain, however, it is difficult to apply these rules to cyber operations. Before discussing the complexity posed by the interconnectivity of cyberspace, it should be admitted that it is not unique to the cyber domain; traditional domains have this problem too. Almost half a century ago, the reality that there is ‘a geographical and functional mixture of combatants and civilians and military objectives and civilian objects’ in the conduct of military air © 2023 The Author Journal compilation © 2023 Edward Elgar Publishing Ltd Downloaded from https://www.elgaronline.com/ at 07/16/2025 08:36:46PM via University College London (UCL) The application of the principle of precautions to cyber operations 5 operations was discussed, and the importance of taking precautionary measures was emphasized in a pamphlet published by the United States (US) Air Force.⁴ Despite the similarity between the traditional and cyber domains in terms of interconnectivity, what makes interconnectivity special regarding cyber military operations is that it ‘characterises cyberspace, which means that whatever has an interface with the Internet can be affected by cyber operations conducted from anywhere in the world’.⁵ In such a complex environment, the adoption of the principle of precautions while planning and executing cyber operations has utmost importance.\nThe interconnectivity problem should be approached from two perspectives, taking into account both the technical and the social factors. From the first standpoint, technical factors intensify the interconnectedness between military and civilian networks in cyberspace, therefore converting this domain into one of entirely dual-use nature and obstructing the distinction between military targets and civilian objects. As Jensen points out, ‘[w]ith 98% of day-to-day government communications routinely travelling over civilian communication lines, there will be many civilian lines of communication that will carry targetable electronic traffic intermixed with civilian traffic’.⁶ From this vantage point, not only is it highly difficult to make a certain distinction between civilian and military cyber infrastructures, but practically all military cyber activities must be carried out through dual-use cyber systems.⁷ In the absence of precautionary measures against such interconnectivity, the impacts of cyber activities might quickly spread to other systems across the globe and have the potential to significantly disrupt daily civilian life by having adverse impacts on civilian critical infrastructure and other associated systems.⁸ From this point of view, a cyber operation designed to disrupt a dual-used power plant located in a belligerent state could easily impair other systems, from water and food to ICT infrastructure, and its unintended effects might spill over into neutral countries.⁹ From the second point of view, interconnection becomes a more complicated matter when social factors are considered. Even though they are less obvious than technical ones, they still pose threats comparable to those of the latter, and it necessitates especially defensive parties to take unique precautionary measures. Therefore, it has been © 2023 The Author Journal compilation © 2023 Edward Elgar Publishing Ltd Downloaded from https://www.elgaronline.com/ at 07/16/2025 08:36:46PM via University College London (UCL) The Military Law and the Law of War Review, Vol. 61 No. 1 stated in the NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) COE-DAT (Centre of Excellence for the Defence Against Terrorism) Handbook that ‘[e]ngineers, together with their cell phones, access cards, tokens, and server rooms, should be considered in a networked mentality. This perspective would reveal just how many components are connected and demonstrate the levels of complexity in a facility’.¹⁰ This entails that the human workforce of a facility needs to be considered in terms of the complexity of the system’s network. When this fact about a single facility is considered along with the global challenge of interconnectivity, the magnitude of the interconnectivity issue could be better understood.\nGiven that measures to prevent adversarial effects on cyber systems cannot keep up with their level of interconnectivity,¹¹ this article aims to portray how to apply the principle of precautions to cyber operations and answers this question by taking its humanity-based character into account. The present author acknowledges that the articles articulating the principle of precautions are vague, as stated by state delegates during the negotiations of Additional Protocol-I or by state legal advisers.¹² Such views on specific provisions of the article or the article as a whole are expressed using terms like ‘open to a variety of interpretations by the conflicting parties’¹³ (for Article 57(2)(a)(ii)), ‘subjective’¹⁴ ‘ambiguous’¹⁵ (for Article 57(2)(a)), ‘deficient in clarity due to its generally vague wording’¹⁶ (for Article 57), and ‘too general’¹⁷ (for articles between 48 and 58). Moreover, delegates emphasized the hardships posed by applying these provisions in practice.¹⁸ When the complexity of cyberspace interconnectivity is combined with the ambiguity of the articles, applying the principle of precautions appears to bring together two ‘unknown unknowns’ in order to reach one ‘known known’.¹⁹ Throughout this piece of research, the author attempts to emphasize the humanity-based character of the principle of precautions in order to convert this ambiguity into a flexibility to apply the rules more effectively.²⁰ The LOAC, in general, aims to achieve a balance between military necessity and humanity.²¹ From this perspective, it is accepted that some harm will occur; on the © 2023 The Author Journal compilation © 2023 Edward Elgar Publishing Ltd Downloaded from https://www.elgaronline.com/ at 07/16/2025 08:36:46PM via University College London (UCL) The application of the principle of precautions to cyber operations 7 other hand, it should be minimized as much as possible. In other words, ‘[t]he thrust is not absolute elimination of the calamities of war (a goal which would manifestly be utopian), but relief from the tribulations of war “as much as possible” bearing in mind that war is fought to be won’.²² At this point, it sounds rational that these two notions should be balanced while applying the principles governing the conduct of hostilities.\nOn the other hand, considering the peculiarity of interconnectedness in cyberspace, this balance should be leaned toward humanity while applying the principle of precautions. There are some reasons in favour of such an interpretation. To begin with, the notion of ‘balance’ is significantly subjective.²³ From a practitioner perspective, when the armed conflict starts, reality does not permit such a compromise,²⁴ and the perception of ‘balance’ is determined by those on the battlefield. However, outside of the conflict, such a balance could be perceived differently by scholars or judges who need to evaluate the legality of such actions, and their views seem more ‘humanitarian’ to practitioners. As stated by Luban, ‘[f]or military lawyers, the starting point is military necessity, and the reigning assumption is that legal regulation of war must accommodate military necessity. For humanitarian lawyers, the starting point is human dignity and human rights’.²⁵ As a result, such disparities in viewpoints considerably alter the perception of balance, and trying to achieve a balance in the principle of precautions seems to be a rhetorical word.\nApart from the subjectivity of balance depending on different perceptors, the nature of the LOAC principles inherently provides a lean toward either military necessity or humanity.²⁶ While the principles of distinction and proportionality are more eligible to more generally’. See A Sari and K Tinkler, ‘Collateral Damage and the Enemy’ (2019) British Yearbook of International Law 63. From the standpoint of this article, military necessity is held as a permission giving to a belligerent party in order to ‘apply any amount and kind of force to compel the complete submission of the enemy with the least possible expenditure of time, life, and money’ by not violating the LOAC. See The Hostage Case, Case No. 7 (United States v. Wilhelm List et al.), (Opinion and Judgment and Sentence) [1949] 1253 (‘The Hostage Case’). Pictet defines humanity as ‘a sentiment of active goodwill towards mankind’ by referring to Littré’s dictionary. See J Pictet, The Fundamental Principles of the Red Cross (1956) 143. By considering this definition, this article holds the principle of humanity as a ‘guiding principle that puts a brake on undertakings which might otherwise be justified by the principle of military necessity’. See APV Rogers, Law on the Battlefield (Juris Publishing, 2004) 7.\n\n© 2023 The Author Journal compilation © 2023 Edward Elgar Publishing Ltd Downloaded from https://www.elgaronline.com/ at 07/16/2025 08:36:46PM via University College London (UCL) The Military Law and the Law of War Review, Vol. 61 No. 1 be interpreted from a military necessity perspective, the principle of precautions goes in the opposite direction.

See S Watts, ‘Law-of-War Precautions: A Cautionary Note’ in RTP Alcala and E Talbot Jensen (eds), The Impact of Emerging Technologies on the Law of Armed Conflict (Oxford University Press, 2019) 116.\n© 2023 The Author Journal compilation © 2023 Edward Elgar Publishing Ltd Downloaded from https://www.elgaronline.com/ at 07/16/2025 08:36:46PM via University College London (UCL) The Military Law and the Law of War Review, Vol. 61 No. 1 in which it is stated that both attacking and defending parties shall take precautions to spare civilians and civilian objects in an armed conflict. At this point, for *jus in bello* cyberspace operations, the principle of precautions provides a twofold protection: the first comprises taking constant care while conducting cyber attacks ('precautions in attack'), and the second comprises taking feasible precautions in order to protect civilians from the effects of cyber attacks ('precautions against the effects of attacks') during armed conflicts. These precautions can also be named 'active' and 'passive' precautions ruled under Articles 57 and 58 of the AP-I.\nThe rules stated in Articles 57 and 58 are applied in times of armed conflicts, though the definition of 'armed conflict' is not provided in the Protocol. In this article, the definition given in the Tadic Decision, in which it was described as 'a resort to armed force between States or protracted armed violence between governmental authorities and organized armed groups or between such groups within a State',[39] is adopted. From this definition, it can be stated that there are two types of armed conflicts; 'between States' (international armed conflicts), and 'between governmental authorities and organized armed groups or between such groups' (non-international armed conflicts). In identifying the nature of the conflict, the status of the actors is the decisive factor.[40] The importance of this distinction is that while the AP-I, which is applicable to international armed conflicts, clearly states the obligation to take precautions, there is no clear provision which regulates the principle of precautions in Additional Protocol-II,[41] which is applicable to non-international armed conflicts. However, it does not prevent the application of the principle to the latter type of conflicts since it is stated in Article 13(1) of the AP-II that '[t]he civilian population and individual civilians shall enjoy general protection against the dangers arising from military operations'. Therefore, it is argued in the work of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) on Customary Rules that, by approving the customary nature of the principle for both international and non-international armed conflict, it is hard to abide by such a rule without taking any precaution.[42] Moreover, it is stated in the Tadic Decision that 'all necessary precautions should be taken to avoid injury, loss or damage to civilian populations' in all kinds of armed conflicts by referring to a resolution adopted by the United Nations General Assembly.[43] Finally, two recent treaties that are applicable to non-international armed conflicts explicitly regulate the principle of precautions.[44] © 2023 The Author Journal compilation © 2023 Edward Elgar Publishing Ltd Downloaded from https://www.elgaronline.com/ at 07/16/2025 08:36:46PM via University College London (UCL) The application of the principle of precautions to cyber operations 11 It is crucial to make the distinction between military operations and attacks since some precautions are applicable to all military operations, as stated in Article 57 (1) and (4), though others can only be applied to attacks.⁴⁵ However, when these provisions are read together with Article 49, it might cause confusion in the first instance because while Article 49(3) clearly restricts the application of Section IV rules of the AP-I to operations conducted in the air or sea which have impacts on ‘civilians or civilian objects on land’, Article 57(4) seems to obligate parties to respect the principle of precautions in the conduct of these operations without any limitation. To solve this problem, one should deem Article 57(4) as ‘merely a restatement of one of the existing rules’.⁴⁶ As Article 49(3) makes clear, the article does not affect those rules that are customary in nature and applicable to all types of military operations. Therefore, Article 57(4) does not contradict but rather ‘complement’ it.⁴⁷ Since the principle of precautions applies to both operations and attacks, both of these terms should be clarified. At this point, military operations are ‘any movements, manoeuvres and other activities whatsoever carried out by the armed forces with a view to combat’.⁴⁸ Therefore, all parties to the conflict should exercise constant care while conducting their military operations. For instance, if a tank driver harms civilian property while maneuvering the vehicle, he/she will be responsible due to the breach of the principle of precautions.⁴⁹ From this perspective, if a perpetrator destroys a civilian network while conducting cyber exploitation against either a civilian or military cyber system, he/she will bear responsibility. However, military attacks require a certain threshold since they are violent acts causing death, injury, damage, or destruction – or at least intending to do so.⁵⁰ As a result, all military attacks are kinds of military operations but vice versa would not be true. Therefore, while cyber operation can be defined as ‘the employment of cyber capabilities to achieve objectives in or through cyberspace’,⁵¹ cyber attack is ‘a cyber operation, whether offensive or defensive, that is reasonably expected to cause injury or death to persons or damage or destruction to objects’.⁵² In light of this, cyber attack is a special kind of cyber operation that results in violent effects. However, cyber attacks require a broader understanding because damage to objects may occur as a secondary effect of cyber operations. Therefore, the present author agrees with the approach of the majority of the International Group of Experts (the Experts), who prepared the Tallinn Manual, that cyber operations that result in the replacement of a component by having an impact on the functionality of an object fall within the ambit of attack because, while these kinds of operations do not damage an object in the first instance, their effects in later phases reach the threshold of attack by causing physical harm.⁵³ ⁴⁵.

At this point, the applicability of international law to cyber operations is recognized by states and international organizations.⁵⁵ Also, there is a certain difference between a cyber operation and an attack, and not all precautionary measures are applicable to all kinds of cyber operations.\n## 2.2 Constant care According to Article 57(1) of the AP-I, the attacking party shall always take ‘constant care’ to spare civilians and civilian objects while conducting military operations. The term ‘constant care’ is clarified in the HPCR Manual Commentary by stating that ‘there are no exceptions from the duty to seek to spare the civilian population, civilians and civilian objects’.⁵⁶ Therefore, constant care obliges all levels of the armed forces who are responsible for planning, ordering or executing a cyber operation to always consider the results of it and try to minimize its effects on civilians.⁵⁷ The ‘constant care’ obligation is necessary for cyber operations. Those who are involved in the operation should always be aware of the foreseeable effects of operations on the civilian population and property and try to minimize these effects as much as possible. For this reason, it is not enough to demonstrate due care in the planning stage; this obligation extends to all stages of the operation in which civilians might be affected. In other words, these people should have ‘situational awareness at all times’.⁵⁸ The concept of situational awareness is explained in the Allied Joint Doctrine for Cyberspace Operations by describing it as ‘a combination of a near real-time updated RCP [Recognised Cyberspace Picture], analysis and information management’.⁵⁹ Although the obligation is constrained by the execution stage of an operation as described in the article, the effects of the attack can continue.

If the effects of the operation on civilians are not excessive compared to the anticipated military advantage, then the attacking party may continue to carry out cyber operations. However, the calculation may be difficult because of the time-sensitivity. Planned operations give more chance to the attacking party to take better precautions, though time-sensitive ones generally do not permit sufficient time to implement more suitable precautions.⁶³ Although the impact of such a condition on precautions is not deniable, it does not give permission to the attacker to deviate from the principle because the constant care obligation necessitates parties to take feasible precautions in all circumstances.⁶⁴ The second significant hurdle might be the secretive nature of cyberspace since ambiguity is at the centre of cyber warfare.⁶⁵ Even though attribution may be difficult in that domain and the perpetrator of cyber acts that violate the LOAC cannot be easily found, parties to the conflict should obey the rules of the LOAC by considering warrior ethics. From this perspective, cyber warriors should always seek ways to mitigate risks towards civilians in good faith since ‘[r]espect for LOAC obligations is the essential touchstone for that ethical foundation’.⁶⁶ This ethical foundation serves for better protection of civilians, which is an inherent objective of the LOAC.⁶⁷ Last but not least, the ‘constant care’ obligation should not be accepted as limited to this article. It involves all phases of operations and attacks, which are carried out by both attacking and defending parties. For this reason, it has a guidance function while examining all provisions of Articles 57 and 58.\n## 2.3 Feasibility Article 57 obliges parties to take ‘feasible’ precautions in order to minimize the effects of an attack on civilians and civilian objects. In the Official Commentary of Article 57, it is stated that those precautions are ‘everything that was practicable or practically possible, taking into account all the circumstances at the time of the attack, including ⁶⁰.

At this point, every situation has its unique features, and those responsible for an attack should adapt various precautions by considering the characteristics of the situation. For example, an attacker party should map the target network through exploitation operations if it is connected to other civilian networks.71 In such situations, LOAC not only permits cyber espionage but also obligates a belligerent party to conduct these operations. However, such operations require a certain level of technical expertise, and in the absence of that, such a network should not be exploited.72 Despite such expertise, some mistakes may occur in the 'fog of war'.73 At this point, a commander who took 'all due measures' is not responsible for this harm.74 Those measures can be identified by different factors such as available cyber means, time sensitivity, the cyber defence system of the enemy, the characteristics of the target, intelligence assets, the expertise of the attacking team, the loyalty of the enemy of to the LOAC, and available assets and vulnerabilities of the enemy.75 However, even if feasible precautions are taken, unintended results may occur for various reasons, such as failure of the intelligence system, dysfunction of the technology, or unexpected changes in tactical conditions.76 For instance, a commander might prepare a map of a cyber network before conducting an attack, but the virus unintentionally spreads among the civilian infrastructure, which has a connection with the military network.77 At this point, while deciding on whether the principle of precautions is respected or not, one should not focus on outcomes, but compliance should be measured by the process in which an © 2023 The Author Journal compilation © 2023 Edward Elgar Publishing Ltd Downloaded from https://www.elgaronline.com/ at 07/16/2025 08:36:46PM via University College London (UCL)</https:> The application of the principle of precautions to cyber operations 15 attacking party makes diligent efforts.⁷⁸ For instance, if an attacker has advanced cyber capabilities that make it possible to disrupt an electrical grid without harming civilians but prefers to carry out an attack by conventional means – which results in civilian damage – it cannot claim that its adversary does not use the same level of technology to refrain from harming civilians.⁷⁹ Thus, it is true that each party has a responsibility ‘within its means or methods or its capability’ as stated by the Indian delegate.⁸⁰ Even if the commander has advanced cyber weapons, he/she may try to spare them for use during later stages of the conflict by taking military considerations into account. Therefore, it is permitted for the military commander in the Naval Manual of Ecuador to use alternative methods ‘in light of all the facts known or reasonably available to him, including the need to conserve resources and complete the mission successfully’.⁸¹ However, if it is understood that using less advanced weapons will result in excessive collateral damage, then they should either use advanced ones or cancel the attack.⁸² On the other hand, the determination of feasibility on a contextual basis should not be used to assuage the burden from the shoulders of the attacker. For example, the use of white phosphorus shells near al-Wafa hospital, where patients have serious injuries and need long-term care, by the Israeli armed forces was deemed a violation of Articles 57(2)(b) and (c) of the AP-I.⁸³ It was stated that those who were responsible for the attack should be aware of ‘all the facts and circumstances’.⁸⁴ For this reason, while conducting a cyber operation against a system in which some medical records may be located, the attacking party should take special care. The same is valid for facilities such as dams, where dangerous forces are located.⁸⁵ ## 2.4 Responsibility The wording of Article 57 restricts its applicability to ‘those who plan or decide upon an attack’. Because of this wording, some states have expressed reservations about Article 57, claiming that it only applies to ‘commanding officers at the battalion or group level and those of higher ranks’.⁸⁶ Nonetheless, every soldier who breaches obligations imposed by the LOAC bears individual criminal responsibility for his/her acts when such crimes are committed with ‘intent and knowledge’.⁸⁷ At this point, it does ⁷⁸.

The reason is that volumetric attacks can end up using all available channel capacity, which would affect the networks on the path to the target. This has happened in the past, with powerful DDoS attacks launched against specific targets and affecting entire internet infrastructure providers.⁹⁵ However, the unpredictability of effects does not relieve the responsibility of all levels of command while conducting operations. According to Watkin, operational factors cannot be put forward in order not to take feasible precautions in today’s trend, which pursues to compromise ‘human rights-like accountability frameworks with operational decision making during armed conflict’.⁹⁶ Accordingly, all members of the armed forces who are part of operations in cyberspace should do everything feasible within their limits.\nWhile assessing the individual responsibility of officers, they should be judged by how much they know about a certain subject. The well-known example is the Rendulic Decision, in which the Nuremberg Tribunal held that ‘the “scorched earth” policy in ⁸⁸ Sandoz, Swinarski and Zimmermann (eds) (fn 3) 2197; APV Rogers, ‘General Report-Conduct of Combat and Risks Run by the Civilian Population’ (1982) 21 Mil.

For this reason, later evidence which showed that ‘the danger did not actually exist’ cannot be used to convict the commander since he ‘acted within the limits of honest judgment on the basis of the conditions prevailing at the time’. This is crucial considering the interconnectivity of cyberspace since cyber attacks might affect civilian networks unexpectedly despite a commander’s employment of the advanced technology to conduct constant surveillance over a network. At this point, the responsibility arising out of a cyber attack would not go beyond what the defendant knew at the time of the attack.\nOn the other hand, one needs to distinguish misinformation from misconception. Misconception of the nature of the target might occur because of cognitive bias, which misdirects attackers by analyzing information ‘in a manner that supports their pre-existing beliefs or mental frameworks’. States should employ a variety of techniques such as ‘training and education, red teaming procedures, specific positive identification (PID) policies for targeting, use of structured analytic techniques, and other analytic tradecraft practices’ in order for this not to result in civilian damage. Despite the fact that states are keen to protect soldiers in such situations, inflicting civilian harm due to biased decisions does not very well fit with the notion of ‘honest judgement’.\nLastly, those who undertake cyber operations may be fully aware of the results of their actions owing to their technical expertise since cyberspace requires unique understanding compared to traditional domains. If a higher commander issues an order to launch a cyber operation without being aware of the outcomes in good faith, inferior commanders will be responsible for such intentional conduct. However, if a commander is aware that he lacks sufficient information about a target, he should either change the concept of the attack or refrain from issuing such an order. Should an operation continue to be carried out while being aware of this insufficiency, responsibility arises.\n# 3 PRECAUTIONS IN ATTACK ## 3.1 Target verification It is stated in Article 57(2) of the AP-I that: (a) those who plan or decide upon an attack shall: (i) do everything feasible to verify that the objectives to be attacked are neither civilians nor civilian objects and are not subject to special protection but are military objectives within the © 2023 The Author Journal compilation © 2023 Edward Elgar Publishing Ltd Downloaded from https://www.elgaronline.com/ at 07/16/2025 08:36:46PM via University College London (UCL) The Military Law and the Law of War Review, Vol. 61 No. 1 meaning of paragraph 2 of Article 52 and that it is not prohibited by the provisions of this Protocol to attack them.\nThe rationale behind this provision is to prevent carrying out attacks against objectives that are not military in nature because of misinformation or against military objectives in order to get a small military advantage by significantly harming civilians and objects.^[105]^ The binding definition of military objectives is codified in Article 52(2) of the AP-I, which states that: [M]ilitary objectives are limited to those objects which by their nature, location, purpose or use make an effective contribution to military action and whose total or partial destruction, capture or neutralization, in the circumstances ruling at the time, offers a definite military advantage.\nFrom this definition, there must be two cumulative elements ('two-pronged test')^[106]^ in order to deem an object as military, which are effective contribution and military advantage. For this reason, an object that is military in nature should not be subject to attack if it does not effectively contribute to the military capacity of an enemy.^[107]^ While only Article 52(2) of the AP-I has found its place in the provision, lawful targets also include people who can be made the object of direct cyber attacks. According to the LOAC, various categories of people can be held as lawful targets. The first one consists of combatants who are members of the armed forces and have a right to directly participate in hostilities.^[108]^ Even though they are lawful targets, they have a right to be treated as prisoners of war when they are captured by the enemy.^[109]^ The second category includes direct participants in hostilities. Although they are civilian in nature, they will be accepted as lawful targets if they meet three cumulative criteria which are: threshold of harm, direct causation and belligerent nexus.^[110]^ Those people are lawful targets 'for such time as they take a direct part in hostilities',^[111]^ and if they are captured, they cannot benefit from prisoner of war status.\nThe third category, though there is a discussion on it, consists of members of an organized armed group that is a belligerent party in an armed conflict. They are 'individuals whose continuous function involves the preparation, execution, or command of acts or operations amounting to direct participation in hostilities'.^[112]^ © 2023 The Author Journal compilation © 2023 Edward Elgar Publishing Ltd Downloaded from https://www.elgaronline.com/ at 07/16/2025 08:36:46PM via University College London (UCL) The application of the principle of precautions to cyber operations 19 At first glance, the second and third categories may seem identical, but the difference is that while civilians who fall into the former categories ‘directly participate in hostilities on a merely spontaneous, sporadic, or unorganized basis’, the latter category of people has a continuous combat function, which ‘requires lasting integration into an organised armed group acting as the armed forces of a non-state party to an armed conflict’.¹¹³ The result of this distinction is that those who directly participate in hostilities lose their protected status only for a limited period of time, but the last category of individuals loses it ‘as long as they remain members’, and this membership renders them lawful targets ‘even before he or she first carries out a hostile act’.¹¹⁴ After it was stated in the Official Commentary that the military commander does not need to have personal knowledge, it was argued that even if there is a ‘slight doubt’, additional information shall be obtained.¹¹⁵ By supporting it, Rogers points out that ‘[i]n the event of doubt about the nature of the target, an attack should not be carried out, with a possible exception where failure to prosecute the attack would put attacking forces in immediate danger’.¹¹⁶ However, this approach is challenged by some states, which claim that the determination should be ‘substantial doubt’¹¹⁷ to suspend an attack and require supplementary information. In the same vein, various authors claimed that conducting military operations without having a doubt on the nature of a target is not a reasonable expectation in the fog of war.¹¹⁸ From this perspective, there is always some doubt as an inherent characteristic of combat. On the other hand, the present author thinks that the Official Commentary should be interpreted as the aim of a commander. By stating the ‘slight doubt’ requirement, the commentary obligates them to take better precautions even if it is possible to erase this doubt. This is approved by military practice, in which attacks are cancelled when combatants are not ‘certain’¹¹⁹ or ‘100 percent sure of their aiming point’.¹²⁰ According to Parks, the US achieved this level of accuracy during the Linebacker II campaign by constantly confirming the nature of targets, implementing rules set by the Strategic Air Command, and issuing bomb damage assessments after each attack.¹²¹ Despite the fact that such high-level precautions sometimes pose substantial risks to the combatants’ lives, he acknowledges that they are important not only in terms of legality but also for achieving military and political objectives.¹²² By considering such positive outcomes, a commander should be sure enough that he/she made reasonable efforts to verify the nature of the target in cyberspace.¹²³ © 2023 The Author Journal compilation © 2023 Edward Elgar Publishing Ltd Downloaded from https://www.elgaronline.com/ at 07/16/2025 08:36:46PM via University College London (UCL)</https:> The Military Law and the Law of War Review, Vol. 61 No. 1 Lastly, the dual nature of cyber systems might cause an attacker to identify only one particular part of the target as military, and the determination of other parts may remain unclear. At this point, cyber attack should be limited to that component, which is military in nature.¹²⁴ If it is not possible, then the attack should be cancelled. However, this should not be equated with being ‘perfectly familiar with the network’¹²⁵ since such an interpretation is not appropriate with the term ‘feasible’.\n## 3.2 Choice of cyber means and methods After the nature of the target is verified, the next step will be to compose an operational plan that will have a minimum effect on civilians. At this point, it is stated in Article 57 (2)(a)(ii) of the AP-I that members of the armed forces should ‘take all feasible precautions in the choice of means and methods of attack with a view to avoiding, and in any event to minimising, incidental loss or civilian life, injury to civilians and damage to civilian objects’. This means that even if an attack is proportionate, parties to the conflict should be careful in their choice of means and methods in order to minimize the effects of attacks as much as possible while still aiming to obtain maximum military advantage. At this point, an attacking party should produce a plan that promises to give the most efficient operational and legal results.¹²⁶ It is important to define ‘cyber means’ and ‘methods’. Cyber means are defined as ‘cyber weapons and their associated cyber systems’¹²⁷ in the Tallinn Manual. At this point, cyber weapons are kinds of cyber means, but the latter includes a broader category. Cyber methods, on the other hand, are defined as ‘the cyber tactics, techniques, and procedures by which hostilities are conducted’.¹²⁸ Whilst cyber means are concerned with which tools should be employed to carry out cyber operations, cyber methods are concerned with how these operations should be carried out.¹²⁹ Based on this viewpoint, while botnets are a type of cyber means, the DDoS attack that is conducted by botnets can be considered a type of cyber method.¹³⁰ There is no weapon or method that is specifically prohibited in the provision. It only obliges parties to take feasible precautions by choosing appropriate means and methods; thereby, a commander will not be responsible for causing civilian harm. However, the rule does not require parties to choose means and methods that may decrease their expected military advantage.¹³¹ Even if alternative means and methods are not used because of this concern, a planned cyber attack must abide by other principles such as distinction and proportionality.¹³² On the other hand, if choosing different means and methods may change the degree of damage by producing ‘equivalent effects’ upon the target, then alternative means or methods shall be selected.¹³³ A facility where armed forces of a belligerent party conduct cyber attacks against the enemy, ¹²⁴.

However, this may result in civilian deaths who live in the vicinity of the facility. At this point, if an attacking party has available means to conduct a cyber attack, it shall use them against the system or computers in the facility to stop belligerent attacks. Additionally, military personnel’s expertise with those new technologies is crucial. The concern was raised in the Eritrea-Ethiopia Claims Commission. Even though Eritrea refused Ethiopia’s allegations that some of its aircraft intentionally attacked civilians, the inexperience of Eritrean pilots in using ‘computerized aiming systems’, which led to the failure to target military objectives, was held as a violation of Article 57 of the AP-I.¹³⁴ Lastly, a ‘target list’ can be prepared and constantly reviewed by belligerent parties in order to determine which type of weapon should be used to decrease civilian harm by considering the characteristics of the target.¹³⁵ For example, the bombardment of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) compound by the Israeli Armed Forces, which resulted in extensive damage and endangered the lives of many civilians, was accepted as reckless conduct and a violation of Article 57(2)(a)(ii) of the AP-I since it was executed while being aware of its importance for civilians.¹³⁶ However, in the Vietnam War, the US employed fragmentation bombs that had limited effects on the target to execute attacks against anti-aircraft batteries; since these batteries were located inside dikes, the army tried to refrain from damaging them.¹³⁷ The accuracy and range of weapons also have a particular importance in the execution of attacks.¹³⁸ If a target can be destroyed by accurate weapons, then it does not make sense to use dumb bombs or other means whose effects may not be calculated properly or limited. In this sense, the US practice in the Linebacker II campaign is important. During the campaign, the B-52s that have wide-range effects were employed because of weather conditions and the limited number of the more precise weapons.¹³⁹ But to keep the collateral damage to a minimum, the B-52s were used against targets that were either sufficiently large or in military-industrial complexes.¹⁴⁰ Other objectives requiring pinpoint strikes, such as bridges and railroad yards, were hit by more precise weapons when weather conditions permitted, which was limited to 12 hours during the 12-day campaign.¹⁴¹ As such practice in a highly interconnected battle arena demonstrates, cyber means and weapons should be used against adversaries while always considering their accuracy and range. When it would not be possible to precisely damage a cyber target that is interconnected with a civilian network, they should be used against military cyber networks, or at least those networks whose destruction does not have a significant impact on civilians. In this manner, a cyber mean can be designed to affect only a specific type of system, as it was in the Stuxnet incident, in which malware only affected the SCADA systems.\n¹³⁴.

That attack used ‘wormable’ destructive malware that could jump from one computer domain to another and hence cross borders into other countries. Russia has been careful in 2022 to confine destructive ‘wiper software’ to specific network domains inside Ukraine itself. But the recent and ongoing destructive attacks themselves have been sophisticated and more widespread than many reports recognize. And the Russian army is continuing to adapt these destructive attacks to changing war needs, including by coupling cyberattacks with the use of conventional weapons.¹⁴⁵ This passage raises two concerns. First, which types of cyber means are used? Second, excluding other considerations such as political or military ones, why did the Russians allegedly employ such means in an armed conflict while adhering to the LOAC?\nAs an answer to the first question, the Microsoft Report lists cyber means that were used or are in use in the Russia-Ukraine War:\n\nAccording to the report, numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4 are ‘all malware families that overwrite data and render machines unbootable’; number 6 is a ‘.NET capability being used for data deletion’; number 7 is a ‘file encryptor sometimes used together with FoxBlade’; and number 8 ‘specifically targets operational technology to achieve physical effects in industrial production and processes’.¹⁴⁶ Even though the Microsoft Report does not give detail about number 5, another report states that it deletes data from physical and logical drives, though its impact is limited.¹⁴⁷ Except for number 8, the effects\n¹⁴².

This brings an important issue to the surface. Even though the debate exists, operations causing such damage do not constitute attacks in terms of *lex lata*. Therefore, it would not be possible to apply Article 57 (2)(a)(ii) to those malwares since the rule encompasses means of warfare that are ‘used, designed, or intended to be used to conduct a cyber attack’.¹⁴⁸ Then the question would be why Russia needs to employ such discriminatory cyber means.\nFrom the present author’s perspective, the war demonstrated that the key benefit of using cyber means in warfare is their adaptability, instead of previous assumptions that cyber operations provide a belligerent party an advantage owing to their low cost or non-attributability. As stated in the report, Russia adapted such means to ‘changing war needs’.¹⁴⁹ This adaptation should be seen from two perspectives: cyber and kinetic. The former is important from a technical standpoint, and the latter is important from a legal standpoint, but both of them need to be examined because of their importance from a military standpoint.\nEven though it does not have a direct relationship with the legality of cyber means in terms of Article 57(2)(a)(ii), the technical standing point is important to understand why parties adopt cyber means in armed conflicts. Every new step in technology has the potential to threaten the kinetic weapon supremacy of an adversary. For example, the invention of a new type of surface-to-air missile system can erase the advantage of the adversary’s aircraft, and the attacking party needs to make a huge investment to improve its aircraft and produce new ones to establish a new squadron. On the other hand, the adaptability of cyber means makes it possible for past used malware to escape from such quick elimination. By adding some extra codes, a cyber weapon can be adjusted based on a new type of cyber security measure, and such modification can turn it into a new type of weapon. As stated by the ICRC, ‘it is possible for offensive cyber capabilities to be reverse-engineered or repurposed so that they can be reused. This is also the case for some traditional weapon systems, but the technical characteristics of cyberspace raise these concerns in a unique manner’.¹⁵⁰ This uniqueness has been and continues to be demonstrated in the Russia-Ukraine War. Numerous reports claim that Russia used or is using malware by modifying previously used ones. In other words, cyber security updates also bring updates to those malwares, and they are adapted to changing needs in the cyber environment. For example, AcidRain, a wiper malware used to disrupt the VIASAT satellite, shares some characteristics with VPNFilter, a kind of malware used by Russia-backed cyber-organized groups in 2018.¹⁵¹ Also, such modifications do not have to take a long time. Shortly after the intrusion of WhisperGate into Ukrainian systems and its detection by cyber security companies, Russia altered it and developed a new type of malware, Hermeticwiper, that ‘has some similarities to the earlier WhisperGate’.¹⁵² This shows that detecting malware and taking defensive measures against it do not make such malware useless, but certain parts of the codes can still be used by belligerents to improve their cyber capabilities owing to their adaptability.\n¹⁴⁸.

Figure 1 above, depicted by Microsoft, shows how critical infrastructures are subject to cyber operations as the Russian tanks roll toward cities. Additionally, the fact that certain facilities, which are being physically attacked, were subject to cyber operations, demonstrates that the coordination is not general but rather as specific as possible. As a result, every operation that is part of an attack has to be evaluated within the meaning of the LOAC, and this necessitates evaluating the cyber means stated above to be employed by respecting relevant rules, including the principle of precautions.\nWhile choosing cyber methods, the first relevant factor is the timing of the attack to minimize collateral damage.[154] During World War II, Allied Forces conducted attacks on military factories at times when there were a minimum number of civilian workers present.[155] In that vein, for example, while carrying out cyber attacks against dual-use objects, the belligerent party may execute them at night or early in the morning when the targets are not intensively used by civilians.\n\n© 2023 The Author Journal compilation © 2023 Edward Elgar Publishing Ltd Downloaded from https://www.elgaronline.com/ at 07/16/2025 08:36:46PM via University College London (UCL) The application of the principle of precautions to cyber operations 25 The second relevant criterion is the location of the target. If a target is located in a place that is mostly used by civilians and there is a significant level of risk of harm occurring, the attacker shall use the most accurate weapons available or must refrain from conducting such an attack.¹⁵⁶ At this point, there is a discussion on whether the Internet can be held as a lawful target because, while it might make an effective contribution to the military capacity of the enemy, it is mostly used by civilians. Even though it is argued that if an attacking party believes that it can get enough military advantage, a cyber attack against the Internet is permissible,¹⁵⁷ another opinion accepts the Internet as a civilian object and prohibits such an attack.¹⁵⁸ According to the latter opinion, even if it is intended to carry out a cyber attack against the Internet, it should be limited to ‘individual networks, servers, routers, links, and other computer facilities that are used for military purposes and which are likely to be connected to the Internet’.¹⁵⁹ By accepting the latter interpretation, the present author considers that if it is possible to considerably limit the effects of the attack, especially by considering the dual nature of cyberspace, then an attack may be conducted. If not, it will be in breach of the rule.\nWhilst some authors argue that the choice of means and methods only come onto the scene when there is a similar advantage,¹⁶⁰ the present author thinks that the criteria should not be applied strictly. As stated by Borghard and Lonergan while discussing coercion in cyberspace, the attacking party tries to apply less harmful ways, such as disruptive operations rather than destructive ones, in order to better negotiate at later stages since the system may be restored more easily when the former type of means are used.¹⁶¹ At this point, the belligerent party should choose the type of means or methods to achieve the intended outcomes by considering the post-conflict situation.¹⁶² There is no doubt that a large number of civilian deaths will prolong the conflict, even if the attacks are perfectly legal. The bombing of Radio-Television of Serbia by NATO, which sparked so many debates about the legality of the campaign, may be an example of the adverse impact of such conduct. To Kolb, even if the station can be assumed as a military objective, it was repaired in three hours, and 16 civilians were killed because of the attack.¹⁶³ By taking lessons from this example, it can be stated that belligerent parties should always consider alternatives, even if a designed cyber attack seems lawful. In such a case, disrupting broadcasting by cyber operation might produce better consequences, even though it seems that destruction promises more advantage. In these kinds of situations, perpetrators should always keep the humanitarian aims of the LOAC in mind.\n¹⁵⁶.

However, both of these provisions have similar meanings by prohibiting attacks conducted against a legitimate target if it seems that ‘excessive’ collateral damage will occur, whether the cyber attack is being planned or has already been planned.¹⁶⁴ At this point, there should be a balance between military advantage and civilian harm.\n## 3.3.1 Military advantage The advantage should be military in nature rather than merely moral, political or financial.¹⁶⁵ For example, conducting cyber attacks against specific sectors of a country, such as the oil industry, which is vital for Arab countries, by considering that such an operation against ‘war-sustaining objects’ will decrease the military effort of an enemy is not appropriate since ‘almost every civilian activity might be construed by the enemy as indirectly sustaining the war effort’ as stated by Dinstein.¹⁶⁶ Also, it is stated in the Official Commentary that this type of advantage can only be gained by the annihilation of an enemy or gaining ground; the transformation of the notion of war, however, changed this paradigm.¹⁶⁷ While the former can be categorized as an overstatement, the latter seems to be an understatement. Hence, as a moderate approach, the HPCR Manual Commentary points out that ‘any consequence of an attack which directly enhances friendly military operations or hinders those of the enemy’¹⁶⁸ should be included within the ambit of military advantage.\nCyber attacks should be assessed as a whole while aiming to obtain military advantage.¹⁶⁹ As stated by Fenrick and approved by declarations of numerous states, proportionality calculations cannot be made on either ‘a bullet-by-bullet basis’ or ‘the basis of attacks on individual military objectives’.¹⁷⁰ Furthermore, when the army launches concerted or coordinated cyber attacks, it may be impossible or impractical for every ¹⁶⁴.

Although it was claimed that people who give an order will bear responsibility rather than those who execute the attack in such a case, if it is apparent that the targeted network is civilian in nature after the attack is initiated, it should be cancelled or a confirmation should be demanded by the perpetrator from higher ranks in light of changing circumstances.¹⁷² Lastly, assessing a cyber attack as a whole should not be interpreted as having a purpose to obtain military advantage by taking the ‘full context of a war strategy’ into account.¹⁷³ Otherwise, all cyber attacks, whether they incur excessive civilian damages or not, can be deemed legal in defiance of the aims of the LOAC.\n## 3.3.2 Collateral damage Collateral damage can be described as an ‘incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians and damage to civilian objects or other protected objects or a combination thereof, caused by an attack on a lawful target’.¹⁷⁴ At this point, collateral damage occurs while conducting cyber attacks against military targets without deliberately targeting civilians and civilian property.\nCollateral damage includes both the direct and indirect effects of a cyber attack. While the former type of effects are those that ‘are the immediate, first order consequence of a military action (weapons employment results, etc.), unaltered by intervening events or mechanisms’;¹⁷⁵ the latter type of effects are ‘the delayed or displaced second-, third-, and higher-order consequences of action, created through intermediate events or mechanisms’.¹⁷⁶ Since cyber operations are carried out at the logical layer of cyberspace, their first-order effects have an impact on data, programs, or software; nevertheless, such effects are not included in the aforementioned definition of collateral damage.¹⁷⁷ Yet, ‘indirect effects may be aimed at the other layers of cyberspace, or at creating other higher-order effects in other domains’, and thereby such effects can raise the level of collateral damage.¹⁷⁸ Therefore, the inclusion of indirect effects in the concept of collateral harm is crucial. However, due to the complexity involved in calculating second- or higher-order effects, such an inclusion also poses a significant challenge in cyberspace. As acknowledged in the Allied Doctrine: Since cyberspace is a global domain, there is a risk of COs [cyberspace operations] having an impact outside the joint operations area. COs can create undesired effects on our own ¹⁷¹. Quéguiner (fn 154) 804.\n¹⁷². Ibid at 804–805.\n¹⁷³.

This risk, as with similar risks in other domains, is factored into the planning.¹⁷⁹ Even though it is not necessary to make certain calculations, effects which are too remote or beyond the scope of reasonable certainty will not cause any responsibility for combatants.¹⁸⁰ Lastly, collateral damage does not contain minor effects such as stress, irritation or inconvenience.¹⁸¹ All cyber attacks might cause stress or inconvenience to some extent, but that does not make them illegal.\n## 3.3.3 Excessive collateral damage Belligerent parties should always consider whether the expected military advantage is proportionate compared to the anticipated collateral damage. At this point, the terms ‘extensive’ and ‘excessive’ should be differentiated. In the Official Commentary, it was argued that conducting attacks against lawful targets should not create ‘extensive destruction of civilian objects’¹⁸² despite the fact that there is no reference to such a limitation in the Additional Protocols. The collateral damage can be justified even if it is at the ‘extensive’ level on the condition that the nominated target is important enough. Although civilian casualties are ‘regrettable and tragic consequences of the war’, those losses do not ‘in themselves establish liability … under international law’ as stated by the Eritrea-Ethiopia Claims Commission.¹⁸³ Excessiveness cannot be determined by approaching it as a mathematical formula, despite the fact that ‘[f]ifty civilians killed for one suspected combatant’ is given as a ‘textbook example of a violation of the proportionality principle’ by some authors.¹⁸⁴ However, as stated in the NATO Bombing Report: It is much easier to formulate the principle of proportionality in general terms than it is to apply it to a particular set of circumstances because the comparison is often between unlike quantities and values. One cannot easily assess the value of innocent human lives as opposed to capturing a particular military objective.¹⁸⁵ Hence, excessiveness should be evaluated depending upon the comparison between two values, namely, collateral damage and military advantage. Although it is hard to estimate excessiveness in cyberspace and to prevent it, there are methods to make a reasonable assessment. It is stated in the Allied Doctrine that: COs [cyberspace operations] will be conducted according to the operation plan. As such, SCEPVA [Sovereign Cyber Effects Provided Voluntarily by Allies], when authorised, might give the commander alternative options to create effects. These options are integrated, ¹⁷⁹.

At this point, the determination of the effects and excessiveness of an action will be based on the good faith of the combatant, its reasonableness and the circumstances in which the cyber attack is planned and executed.\n## 3.4 Effective warning It is stated in Article 57(2)(c) of the AP-I that ‘effective advance warning shall be given of attacks which may affect the civilian population, unless circumstances do not permit’. The first appearance of this rule can be traced back to the Lieber Code, in which it was stated that: Commanders, whenever admissible, inform the enemy of their intention to bombard a place, so that the noncombatants, and especially the women and children, may be removed before the bombardment commences. But it is no infraction of the common law of war to omit thus to inform the enemy. Surprise may be a necessity.¹⁸⁷ As it can be observed from the article, if a party plans to conduct a surprise cyber attack, it does not need to give any warning so as not to endanger the success of the operation.¹⁸⁸ Surprise may be necessary in some cases, such as when there is a risk of a pre-emptive cyber attack or the exposure of a broader campaign.¹⁸⁹ The Tallinn Manual illustrates this by saying that: Consider, for example, a cyber operation involving placement of a kill-switch into the target computer’s control system, to be activated on the occurrence of some future event or after the passage of a specified period. A warning that would give the enemy an opportunity to locate and neutralise the device need not be given.¹⁹⁰ Therefore, giving warning is limited to appropriate circumstances since an attacker may have special reasons that justify not giving any warning.¹⁹¹ A relevant consideration could be the equation comparing the level of military advantage between situations in which giving occurs and those in which it does not. If the gap justifies civilian harm, then the attacking party does not need to give a warning in advance.\nIf it is expected that the cyber attack will exclusively affect civilian objects and not have any impact on civilians, then giving warning will not be necessary.¹⁹² By approving this point, the Australian Military Manual states that the warning can be directed at civilians, who bear the dangers posed by an intended attack, or at responsible authorities.¹⁹³ In that vein, if harm to civilians is expected, then they can be warned in many ways through ¹⁸⁶.

Even though the Australian Military Manual suggests adopting ‘commonsense’ to achieve effectiveness, this does not clarify the notion but adds extra blurriness to it.¹⁹⁷ On the other hand, the term ‘effective’ is defined in the dictionary as ‘producing a decided, decisive, or desired effect’.¹⁹⁸ Based on this definition, it can at least be said that in order for a warning to be effective, it should aim to reduce collateral damage to a minimum. To accomplish this, the content of the warning should be reasonably clear and specific so that civilians have a chance to secure themselves from the effects of an attack.¹⁹⁹ Both of these terms should be determined based on the context. In terms of clarity, rather than giving technical details, belligerent parties may underline the effects of cyber attacks and provide guidelines to civilians on how to protect themselves from such effects. In terms of specificity, there is no requirement to give a specific warning for every situation; the warning may be general in a way that provides a list of cyber objectives that might be targeted.²⁰⁰ Overall, there is no one correct method to issuing effective warnings, but they should be tailored to diverse scenarios to protect civilians.\nWarnings can be conducted through an enemy if it makes the warning more effective.²⁰¹ However, such a warning can also be used as a ruse of war. For example, ‘a false announcement of a cyber attack affecting dual-use systems might prove militarily useful in causing the enemy to take its military assets off-line’.²⁰² Nevertheless, if it is expected that such a warning causes civilians to ignore future real warnings and to put them in danger, then this will be prohibited.²⁰³ Further, the belligerent party should not give a warning in order to spread terror among civilians.²⁰⁴ As stated in Article 51(2) of the AP-I, ‘[a]cts or threats of violence the primary purpose of which is to spread terror among the civilian population are prohibited’. For this reason, warnings given through cyberspace that aim to ‘frighten or cause panic among residents or compel them to leave their homes for reasons other than their safety’ are forbidden.²⁰⁵ Although there is always a danger for civilians to be exposed to fake news via the Internet without the knowledge of the attacking party, it is also their obligation to search for the truth.\n\n© 2023 The Author Journal compilation © 2023 Edward Elgar Publishing Ltd Downloaded from https://www.elgaronline.com/ at 07/16/2025 08:36:46PM via University College London (UCL)</https:> The application of the principle of precautions to cyber operations 31 # 3.5 The least danger rule It is stated in Article 57(3) of the AP-I that: When a choice is possible between several military objectives for obtaining a similar military advantage, the objective to be selected shall be that the attack on which may be expected to cause the least danger to civilian lives and to civilian objects.\nFrom the perspective of this article, if a commander has more than one option, then the rule can be applicable. Therefore, this rule is also known as ‘the lesser of two evils’.²⁰⁶ The rationale behind the article is simple: While a commander is trying to get the maximum effect on the military capacity of the enemy, he/she should seek an option which has minimum effect on civilians. The example given in the Official Commentary is that ‘[i]nstead of attacking railway stations, which are usually located in towns, the railway lines were hit at crucial points, but away from inhabited areas; the same action was taken with respect to roads’.²⁰⁷ By analogy, it can be stated that cyber attacks should be conducted against specific networks of electricity distribution facilities rather than the whole power station.²⁰⁸ However, the rule comes into scene when two different options promise military advantage at the same level.²⁰⁹ Otherwise, the attack is subject to other provisions and principles, i.e., proportionality.\nThere are two critical discussions to have while inflicting the least amount of harm on civilians and civilian property. First, whether or not causing harm to civilians and civilian property is equally important. At this point, while discussing the Kosovo Conflict, General Clark states that ‘[w]e weren’t going to disregard risks to civilians but the alternative to taking risks with property damage was that we might ultimately have to put our troops in on the ground’.²¹⁰ From this example, it seems that objects have less value than civilian lives in practice. However, cyber operations are more likely to have effects on objects than on people. Therefore, the relevant discussion may be whether all objects have the same value in cyberspace. At this point, Henderson offers to determine the value of objects by various factors such as ‘the “utility” of the object, the objects “replace-ability”, and the cost of replacement’.²¹¹ In that vein, in terms of utility, it may be preferable to have an impact on financial records rather than medical data in cyberspace. The second discussion is whether belligerent parties put civilians at greater risk than their own troops. Although some states and scholars adopt the opinion that the security of armed forces should be included in military advantage,²¹² another approach holds that the armed forces must accept the risks posed by combat actions, and those risks should not be borne by civilians.²¹³ The present author considers that an attacking party who conducts cyber attacks against an enemy already minimizes the dangers of combat for its own troops because of their remoteness ²⁰⁶.

Therefore, it should not disregard civilian damage by claiming force protection.\nBeyond mere humanitarianism, it is a military reality to target legitimate objectives to the maximum extent while harming civilians to the minimum. Carnahan states that '[t]he wise military officer will try to concentrate firepower on key military objectives and to keep to a minimum the collateral damage not only for humanitarian reasons, but also because munitions that injure civilians are wasted munitions'.[214] When the humanitarian impacts of such 'wasted munitions' are considered along with their military value, it is a well-known fact that when civilian harm increases, the likelihood of success of the mission decreases, so belligerent parties should aim to put the least amount of risk on civilians if there is an opportunity to refrain from it while gaining a military advantage at the same level, or at least another option that significantly decreases the military advantage.[215] # 4 PRECAUTIONS AGAINST THE EFFECTS OF CYBER OPERATIONS ## 4.1 General remarks It is stated in Article 58 of the AP-I that: The Parties to the conflict shall, to the maximum extent feasible: (a) without prejudice to Article 49 of the Fourth Convention, endeavour to remove the civilian population, individual civilians and civilian objects under their control from the vicinity of military objectives; (b) avoid locating military objectives within or near densely populated areas; (c) take the other necessary precautions to protect the civilian population, individual civilians and civilian objects under their control against the dangers resulting from military operations.\nThe rationale behind the article is to abstain from 'defensive tactics that unnecessarily increases civilian risk' by endangering civilians and civilian objects to the detrimental effects of military operations.[216] For this reason, belligerent parties should segregate their military objectives from civilians and civilian objectives; if this is not possible, they should at least protect these people and objects from the effects of cyber operations.[217] The rule is applicable within the territory of the belligerent party, which is responsible for the protection of its nationals or people under its control.[218] However, this territorial application of the rule may pose a significant hurdle in cyberspace. Although it was claimed that 'all civilian cyber infrastructure and activities located in territory under the control of a party to the conflict are subject to this Rule', this approach cannot be applicable in cyberspace since it is almost impossible to control every civilian activity in this domain.[219] This follows a risk that a responsible government may claim © 2023 The Author Journal compilation © 2023 Edward Elgar Publishing Ltd Downloaded from https://www.elgaronline.com/ at 07/16/2025 08:36:46PM via University College London (UCL) The application of the principle of precautions to cyber operations 33 that ‘it does not have authority over most of the cyber infrastructure due to the various legal regimes that exist within the nation’.²²⁰ At this point, the term ‘control’ refutes such a defence by obligating the party to protect civilians and civilian property by segregating civilian computer systems if it has a capacity to control these systems.²²¹ As a result, this obligation should not be applied by taking territorial concerns into account but rather by considering whether or not these systems are under the de facto control of a party.\nThese precautions are applicable as soon as they are ‘to the maximum extent feasible’. Although the term ‘feasible’ was explained in the first chapter, the Official Commentary further clarifies this term by noting that those measures should ‘not go beyond the point where the life of the population would become difficult or even impossible’.²²² Also, the Tallinn Manual explains the term ‘maximum extent’ in a way that it ‘emphasises the importance of taking the requisite measures’.²²³ According to one approach, those measures can be applied depending upon ‘the requirements of national defence’ as stated in the declaration of Austria.²²⁴ From this perspective, parties do not need to expose all of their military facilities, or to put them in a more dangerous position by considering the dictations of the national defence.²²⁵ This is explained in Official Records by the delegation of the Republic of Korea with the following words: [T]his provision does not constitute a restriction on a State’s military installations on its own territory. We consider that military facilities necessary for a country’s national defence should be decided on the basis of the actual needs and other considerations of that particular country. An attempt to regulate a country’s requirements and the fulfilment of those requirements in this connexion would not conform to actualities.²²⁶ This is a valid argument since, as described in the first chapter, the principle of precautions obligates parties to take measures when they are ‘practicable or practically possible’. For this reason, every country has to take precautions against the effects of cyber attacks within its own limits.\nWhile the term ‘constant care’ is not explicitly stated in the article, it is still a valid consideration which should be taken into account in order to alleviate risks to civilians and civilian property.²²⁷ At this point, Corn points three reasons why constant care should be taken in both active and passive precautions:²²⁸ First, there is no clear line between ‘attacking’ and ‘defending’ parties in terms of operational art since every armed force needs to conduct both types of operations in the conflict. Second, ‘constant care’ obliges all parties of an armed conflict to conduct their operations by taking civilian harm into account as well as seeking to gain military advantage. This obligation cannot be confined to the attacking party. Third, the exclusion of defending © 2023 The Author Journal compilation © 2023 Edward Elgar Publishing Ltd Downloaded from https://www.elgaronline.com/ at 07/16/2025 08:36:46PM via University College London (UCL) The Military Law and the Law of War Review, Vol. 61 No. 1 forces from taking constant care may permit them to pose more risks to civilians as a defensive measure. When the nature of cyberspace is taken into account, the obligation becomes more important than conventional warfare since the domain has many more complexities than other areas.\nThese measures are similarly sampled in the ICRC Challenge Report and the Tallinn Manual while discussing feasible precautions against the effects of cyber attacks: [S]egregating military from civilian cyber infrastructure; segregating computer systems on which critical civilian infrastructure depends from the Internet; backing up important civilian data; making advance arrangements to ensure the timely repair of important computer systems; digitally recording important cultural or spiritual objects to facilitate reconstruction in the event of their destruction; and using anti-virus measures to protect civilian systems that might suffer damage or destruction during an attack on military cyber infrastructure.²²⁹ This is not an exhaustive list, and every situation may require different precautions to be taken.\n## 4.2 The segregation of civilian networks As it is indicated above, Article 58(a) of the AP-I requires parties to ‘endeavour to remove the civilian population, individual civilians and civilian objects under their control from the vicinity of military objectives’. The obligation should be applied when there is an immediate danger to civilians, and they should be evacuated them from the territory ‘where the risk of attack is greatest’.²³⁰ Even if this measure brings some difficulty to civilians, it aims to protect them from greater suffering, and alternative accommodations should be provided.²³¹ If these measures are not achieved, this can be deemed forced displacement and a violation of international law.\nWhilst the rule seems applicable when traditional battlefield is taken into account, it still creates some problems. For example, the rule was opposed by Switzerland because of its geographical conditions, where most civilians live in valleys in which important military facilities are located due to the limited number of useful locations in the country, so it becomes very hard to segregate civilians and civilian objects from the proximity of these facilities.²³² The same hardship is applicable for some facilities that can be important for both civilians and military personnel, such as air traffic control centres and power generation plants.²³³ On the other hand, the application of the rule in cyberspace brings more difficulty than in traditional domains. Civilian infrastructures are used for almost all cyber operations, and most of them have a dual nature.²³⁴ As an example, how can civilians be removed from cloud technology, which is also used for military purposes?²³⁵ Nevertheless, it is argued in a legal assessment published by the US Department of Defence that ‘[w]here there is a choice … military systems should be kept separate from ²²⁹.

The United States military uses multiple, dedicated networks to conduct administrative, logistical and operational activities. The three best-known networks are the Non-Classified Internet Protocol Router Network (NIPRnet, which carries information classified up to and including Sensitive but Unclassified), Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRnet, which carries data classified up to and including the Secret level) and the Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communication System (JWICS carries data classified up to and including Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information).²³⁹ As this example clearly shows, it is imperative to segregate the different types of networks, even if it can be costly.²⁴⁰ Otherwise, if the object makes an effective contribution and the segregation cannot be established, then the whole cyber infrastructure would be a lawful target.²⁴¹ Governmental and civilian data can be stored in the public cloud, despite the fact that this does not literally satisfy the criteria for segregation. However, the Russia-Ukraine War proved its usefulness in terms of reducing cyber dangers. The Ukrainian government moved an important part of the state’s digital infrastructure to the public cloud in preparation for Russian cyber operations against its governmental data center.²⁴² In this sense, cloud technology turns the disadvantage of cyber infrastructure’s interconnectedness into an advantage. As a more advanced example, the Estonian government established a ‘data embassy’ whose ‘resources are under Estonian state control, secured against cyberattacks or crisis situations with KSI [Keyless Signature Infrastructure] Blockchain technology, and are capable not only providing data backups, but also operating the most critical services’.²⁴³ The particular advantage of such precautions compared with network segregation is that they protect civilian data not only from cyber attacks but also from other types of crises that might occur within states’ borders, such as natural disasters or kinetic attacks.²⁴⁴ If such precautions impose a significant burden on the belligerent and are not feasible solutions, belligerent parties should search for other ways to shield civilian © 2023 The Author Journal compilation © 2023 Edward Elgar Publishing Ltd Downloaded from https://www.elgaronline.com/ at 07/16/2025 08:36:46PM via University College London (UCL)</https:> The Military Law and the Law of War Review, Vol. 61 No. 1 networks against cyber operations.²⁴⁵ The pertinent precaution could be the establishment of ‘digital safe havens’ through agreements between belligerent parties; while some systems may be difficult to negotiate due to their potential assistance to the adversary’s military effort, other systems critical to civilian life may be easily agreed upon.²⁴⁶ ## 4.3 The location of military objectives It is stated in Article 58(b) of the AP-I that belligerent parties should ‘avoid locating military objectives within or near densely populated areas’. From this perspective, parties to the conflict should refrain from locating both movable and immovable objects close to densely populated areas in order to protect civilians under their control.²⁴⁷ Nevertheless, the rule should not be limited to densely populated areas but also include ‘hospitals, cultural property, places of worship, prisoner of war camps, and other facilities which are entitled to specific protection’²⁴⁸ by refraining from locating cyber military objectives in or around them.\nWhile the applicability of the rule is understood in a physical sense, and social media or other similar civilian websites ‘cannot be equated with densely populated areas’, the rule obliges parties to take measures by considering cyber infrastructures which are physically located in the territory of a party.²⁴⁹ Therefore, for instance, army cyber commands should not be located in places where civilians or special protected objects can be put in danger. However, there is a significant hurdle to locating defence ministries in a place which is not close to densely populated areas. On the other hand, it is still possible for parties to exclude these kinds of facilities, which are military in nature but almost impossible to locate in isolated places, from the ambit of the attack through negotiation. Even if they cannot be attacked, it is possible for a party to conduct disruptive cyber operations against cyber infrastructures in these facilities. At this point, cyber operations give a unique opportunity to parties not to harm civilians but to still have an impact on the military capacity of their enemies.\n## 4.4 Other passive measures As it is stated above, belligerent parties should ‘take the other necessary precautions to protect the civilian population, individual civilians and civilian objects under their control against the dangers resulting from military operations’ according to Article 58(c) of the AP-I. While there is no limit on the scope of the rule, the Official Commentary states that this rule should be applied to civilians by providing them with protective shelters, as well as to specially protected objects by providing trained personnel to limit damage to them.²⁵⁰ However, conflicting parties should take all feasible precautions by taking the gap-filling function of Article 58(c) into account.\n²⁴⁵.

For example, civilians might be supported by providing them with software products such as anti-virus programs that limit the damage from cyber attacks, detecting civilian cyber systems in order to warn people in case of intrusion attempts, providing them technical assistance when their computer systems are harmed, providing a back-up system to store civilian data, blocking particular IP addresses which pose risks to civilian systems, and keeping ready a system that makes it possible to disconnect an entire country from the Internet when all measures are exhausted.²⁵² While the title of Article 58 includes ‘attacks’, paragraph (c) clearly states that some precautions should be applied to operations. Although Jensen admits the ambiguity of this situation, he argues that countries which are not parties to the AP-I have responsibility arising from this provision for those acts that reach ‘attack’ threshold.²⁵³ In the Tallinn Manual, even though the majority of experts stated that the rule is applicable only to cyber attacks because of the title of the article and the non-existence of customary law, the minority focused on the wording of paragraph (c) by accepting cyber operations within the ambit of this rule.²⁵⁴ Therefore, the minority view kept the threshold lower, determined disruptive operations to be covered by this rule, and obligated parties to take precautions against the effects of these operations.²⁵⁵ However, both parties have a common understanding on the non-application of the rule to ‘mere inconvenience or irritation’.²⁵⁶ There is no clear-cut answer on which precautions should be taken within the ambit of Article 58(c), since the provision serves as a gap-filler in the article. Despite the fact that it did not receive much attention in the past because the suitability of other provisions for kinetic activities made them more visible than paragraph (c), their relative unsuitability for cyber operations rendered this clause more important. At this point, the implementation of the norm in cyberspace has already begun to be shaped by the practices of both state and non-state actors, and this trend seems to be continuing and getting better. For example, the US government has begun to warn private entities when they are subjected to transborder cyber attacks and has provided them with cyber tools and training to combat those attacks.²⁵⁷ Furthermore, the Security Service of Ukraine informs civilians about cyber threats and what measures to take in order to avoid them.²⁵⁸ As a recent innovative example, the ICRC has been conducting research on creating a ‘digital emblem’ for the past two years in order to enable the identification of objects, systems, or networks that cannot be subject to cyber attacks.²⁵⁹ Lastly, even though these are individual precautionary measures, the Russia-Ukraine War has also demonstrated how state and non-state entities can collaborate to © 2023 The Author Journal compilation © 2023 Edward Elgar Publishing Ltd Downloaded from https://www.elgaronline.com/ at 07/16/2025 08:36:46PM via University College London (UCL)</https:> The Military Law and the Law of War Review, Vol. 61 No. 1 protect civilians from the effects of cyber operations. The Microsoft Report highlights two examples of cyber security measures against Russian cyber activities: The first has been the use of technology acquired from RiskIQ that identifies and maps organizational attack surfaces, including devices that are unpatched against known vulnerabilities and therefore are the most susceptible to attack. This information has been shared with the Ukrainian government free of charge to enable it to accelerate the strengthening of cyber-defenses. Ukrainian network defenders worked tirelessly with the constant support of the CERT UA within the government to use this information to protect computers across the country.\nThe second measure has been a wartime innovation pursued with the collaboration and support of the Ukrainian government. MSTIC recognized that Russian malware could be mitigated meaningfully by turning on a feature in Microsoft Defender called controlled folder access. This typically would require that IT administrators access devices across their organization, work made more difficult and potentially even dangerous in wartime conditions. The Ukrainian government therefore authorized Microsoft through special legal measures to act proactively and remotely to turn on this feature across devices throughout the government and across the country.²⁶⁰ Every effort having a purpose to minimize collateral damage is desired in cyberspace; the principle of precaution essentially relies on the processes but not the results.\n# 5 CONCLUSION New technologies have changed the nature of armed conflict significantly, and this process increasingly continues. As one kind of these technologies, cyber operations have introduced significant challenges to the LOAC, but the most unique one is their capability to have a wide range of effects because of the interconnectedness of cyberspace. This article has endeavoured to determine the application of the principle of precautions to cyber operations by tilting the principle towards humanity by considering the natures of both the principle and cyberspace.\nFrom the standpoint of the principle of precautions, the Russia-Ukraine War exemplified an important phenomenon: public-private cooperation against adversarial cyber operations. Unlike traditional domains, private entities have a partial but critical level of control over cyberspace, and as a result of this distinctive feature of the current conflicts, the Ukrainian government collaborated with a technology giant, Microsoft.²⁶¹ This collaboration is emphasized in the Microsoft Report by stating that: [U]nlike the traditional threats of the past, cyber defenses rely on a unique level of public and private collaboration. The evolving threat landscape requires a whole-of-society approach. The private sector, particularly technology companies, are on the front lines of cyber and information attacks. Likewise, civil society organizations are key conveners that play a crucial role in engagement, sometimes are involved in cyber data analysis, and are often targets of these campaigns themselves.²⁶² Bringing non-public entities into the equation in cyberspace, thereby putting more civilians in the balance, would enhance the ‘civilianization’ of armed conflicts, and this would inherently lean the principle of precaution on the side of humanity.\n²⁶⁰.

See League of Nations Res ‘Protection of Civilian Populations Against Bombing from the Air in Case of War’ (30 September 1938). Later, more detailed rules were articulated in Articles 8, 9 and 11 of the Draft Rules for the Limitation of the Dangers incurred by the Civilian Population in Time of War (1956). Despite the fact that states did not adopt these rules, they had an impact on the rules codified in Additional Protocols. See S Watts, ‘Law-of-War Precautions: A Cautionary Note’ in RTP Alcala and E Talbot Jensen (eds), The Impact of Emerging Technologies on the Law of Armed Conflict (Oxford University Press, 2019) 116.\n© 2023 The Author Journal compilation © 2023 Edward Elgar Publishing Ltd Downloaded from https://www.elgaronline.com/ at 07/16/2025 08:36:46PM via University College London (UCL) The Military Law and the Law of War Review, Vol. 61 No. 1 in which it is stated that both attacking and defending parties shall take precautions to spare civilians and civilian objects in an armed conflict. At this point, for *jus in bello* cyberspace operations, the principle of precautions provides a twofold protection: the first comprises taking constant care while conducting cyber attacks ('precautions in attack'), and the second comprises taking feasible precautions in order to protect civilians from the effects of cyber attacks ('precautions against the effects of attacks') during armed conflicts. These precautions can also be named 'active' and 'passive' precautions ruled under Articles 57 and 58 of the AP-I.\nThe rules stated in Articles 57 and 58 are applied in times of armed conflicts, though the definition of 'armed conflict' is not provided in the Protocol. In this article, the definition given in the Tadic Decision, in which it was described as 'a resort to armed force between States or protracted armed violence between governmental authorities and organized armed groups or between such groups within a State',[39] is adopted. From this definition, it can be stated that there are two types of armed conflicts; 'between States' (international armed conflicts), and 'between governmental authorities and organized armed groups or between such groups' (non-international armed conflicts). In identifying the nature of the conflict, the status of the actors is the decisive factor.[40] The importance of this distinction is that while the AP-I, which is applicable to international armed conflicts, clearly states the obligation to take precautions, there is no clear provision which regulates the principle of precautions in Additional Protocol-II,[41] which is applicable to non-international armed conflicts. However, it does not prevent the application of the principle to the latter type of conflicts since it is stated in Article 13(1) of the AP-II that '[t]he civilian population and individual civilians shall enjoy general protection against the dangers arising from military operations'. Therefore, it is argued in the work of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) on Customary Rules that, by approving the customary nature of the principle for both international and non-international armed conflict, it is hard to abide by such a rule without taking any precaution.[42] Moreover, it is stated in the Tadic Decision that 'all necessary precautions should be taken to avoid injury, loss or damage to civilian populations' in all kinds of armed conflicts by referring to a resolution adopted by the United Nations General Assembly.[43] Finally, two recent treaties that are applicable to non-international armed conflicts explicitly regulate the principle of precautions.[44] © 2023 The Author Journal compilation © 2023 Edward Elgar Publishing Ltd Downloaded from https://www.elgaronline.com/ at 07/16/2025 08:36:46PM via University College London (UCL) The application of the principle of precautions to cyber operations 11 It is crucial to make the distinction between military operations and attacks since some precautions are applicable to all military operations, as stated in Article 57 (1) and (4), though others can only be applied to attacks.⁴⁵ However, when these provisions are read together with Article 49, it might cause confusion in the first instance because while Article 49(3) clearly restricts the application of Section IV rules of the AP-I to operations conducted in the air or sea which have impacts on ‘civilians or civilian objects on land’, Article 57(4) seems to obligate parties to respect the principle of precautions in the conduct of these operations without any limitation. To solve this problem, one should deem Article 57(4) as ‘merely a restatement of one of the existing rules’.⁴⁶ As Article 49(3) makes clear, the article does not affect those rules that are customary in nature and applicable to all types of military operations. Therefore, Article 57(4) does not contradict but rather ‘complement’ it.⁴⁷ Since the principle of precautions applies to both operations and attacks, both of these terms should be clarified. At this point, military operations are ‘any movements, manoeuvres and other activities whatsoever carried out by the armed forces with a view to combat’.⁴⁸ Therefore, all parties to the conflict should exercise constant care while conducting their military operations. For instance, if a tank driver harms civilian property while maneuvering the vehicle, he/she will be responsible due to the breach of the principle of precautions.⁴⁹ From this perspective, if a perpetrator destroys a civilian network while conducting cyber exploitation against either a civilian or military cyber system, he/she will bear responsibility. However, military attacks require a certain threshold since they are violent acts causing death, injury, damage, or destruction – or at least intending to do so.⁵⁰ As a result, all military attacks are kinds of military operations but vice versa would not be true. Therefore, while cyber operation can be defined as ‘the employment of cyber capabilities to achieve objectives in or through cyberspace’,⁵¹ cyber attack is ‘a cyber operation, whether offensive or defensive, that is reasonably expected to cause injury or death to persons or damage or destruction to objects’.⁵² In light of this, cyber attack is a special kind of cyber operation that results in violent effects. However, cyber attacks require a broader understanding because damage to objects may occur as a secondary effect of cyber operations. Therefore, the present author agrees with the approach of the majority of the International Group of Experts (the Experts), who prepared the Tallinn Manual, that cyber operations that result in the replacement of a component by having an impact on the functionality of an object fall within the ambit of attack because, while these kinds of operations do not damage an object in the first instance, their effects in later phases reach the threshold of attack by causing physical harm.⁵³ ⁴⁵.

If the effects of the operation on civilians are not excessive compared to the anticipated military advantage, then the attacking party may continue to carry out cyber operations. However, the calculation may be difficult because of the time-sensitivity. Planned operations give more chance to the attacking party to take better precautions, though time-sensitive ones generally do not permit sufficient time to implement more suitable precautions.⁶³ Although the impact of such a condition on precautions is not deniable, it does not give permission to the attacker to deviate from the principle because the constant care obligation necessitates parties to take feasible precautions in all circumstances.⁶⁴ The second significant hurdle might be the secretive nature of cyberspace since ambiguity is at the centre of cyber warfare.⁶⁵ Even though attribution may be difficult in that domain and the perpetrator of cyber acts that violate the LOAC cannot be easily found, parties to the conflict should obey the rules of the LOAC by considering warrior ethics. From this perspective, cyber warriors should always seek ways to mitigate risks towards civilians in good faith since ‘[r]espect for LOAC obligations is the essential touchstone for that ethical foundation’.⁶⁶ This ethical foundation serves for better protection of civilians, which is an inherent objective of the LOAC.⁶⁷ Last but not least, the ‘constant care’ obligation should not be accepted as limited to this article. It involves all phases of operations and attacks, which are carried out by both attacking and defending parties. For this reason, it has a guidance function while examining all provisions of Articles 57 and 58.\n## 2.3 Feasibility Article 57 obliges parties to take ‘feasible’ precautions in order to minimize the effects of an attack on civilians and civilian objects. In the Official Commentary of Article 57, it is stated that those precautions are ‘everything that was practicable or practically possible, taking into account all the circumstances at the time of the attack, including ⁶⁰.

At this point, every situation has its unique features, and those responsible for an attack should adapt various precautions by considering the characteristics of the situation. For example, an attacker party should map the target network through exploitation operations if it is connected to other civilian networks.71 In such situations, LOAC not only permits cyber espionage but also obligates a belligerent party to conduct these operations. However, such operations require a certain level of technical expertise, and in the absence of that, such a network should not be exploited.72 Despite such expertise, some mistakes may occur in the 'fog of war'.73 At this point, a commander who took 'all due measures' is not responsible for this harm.74 Those measures can be identified by different factors such as available cyber means, time sensitivity, the cyber defence system of the enemy, the characteristics of the target, intelligence assets, the expertise of the attacking team, the loyalty of the enemy of to the LOAC, and available assets and vulnerabilities of the enemy.75 However, even if feasible precautions are taken, unintended results may occur for various reasons, such as failure of the intelligence system, dysfunction of the technology, or unexpected changes in tactical conditions.76 For instance, a commander might prepare a map of a cyber network before conducting an attack, but the virus unintentionally spreads among the civilian infrastructure, which has a connection with the military network.77 At this point, while deciding on whether the principle of precautions is respected or not, one should not focus on outcomes, but compliance should be measured by the process in which an © 2023 The Author Journal compilation © 2023 Edward Elgar Publishing Ltd Downloaded from https://www.elgaronline.com/ at 07/16/2025 08:36:46PM via University College London (UCL)</https:> The application of the principle of precautions to cyber operations 15 attacking party makes diligent efforts.⁷⁸ For instance, if an attacker has advanced cyber capabilities that make it possible to disrupt an electrical grid without harming civilians but prefers to carry out an attack by conventional means – which results in civilian damage – it cannot claim that its adversary does not use the same level of technology to refrain from harming civilians.⁷⁹ Thus, it is true that each party has a responsibility ‘within its means or methods or its capability’ as stated by the Indian delegate.⁸⁰ Even if the commander has advanced cyber weapons, he/she may try to spare them for use during later stages of the conflict by taking military considerations into account. Therefore, it is permitted for the military commander in the Naval Manual of Ecuador to use alternative methods ‘in light of all the facts known or reasonably available to him, including the need to conserve resources and complete the mission successfully’.⁸¹ However, if it is understood that using less advanced weapons will result in excessive collateral damage, then they should either use advanced ones or cancel the attack.⁸² On the other hand, the determination of feasibility on a contextual basis should not be used to assuage the burden from the shoulders of the attacker. For example, the use of white phosphorus shells near al-Wafa hospital, where patients have serious injuries and need long-term care, by the Israeli armed forces was deemed a violation of Articles 57(2)(b) and (c) of the AP-I.⁸³ It was stated that those who were responsible for the attack should be aware of ‘all the facts and circumstances’.⁸⁴ For this reason, while conducting a cyber operation against a system in which some medical records may be located, the attacking party should take special care. The same is valid for facilities such as dams, where dangerous forces are located.⁸⁵ ## 2.4 Responsibility The wording of Article 57 restricts its applicability to ‘those who plan or decide upon an attack’. Because of this wording, some states have expressed reservations about Article 57, claiming that it only applies to ‘commanding officers at the battalion or group level and those of higher ranks’.⁸⁶ Nonetheless, every soldier who breaches obligations imposed by the LOAC bears individual criminal responsibility for his/her acts when such crimes are committed with ‘intent and knowledge’.⁸⁷ At this point, it does ⁷⁸.

The reason is that volumetric attacks can end up using all available channel capacity, which would affect the networks on the path to the target. This has happened in the past, with powerful DDoS attacks launched against specific targets and affecting entire internet infrastructure providers.⁹⁵ However, the unpredictability of effects does not relieve the responsibility of all levels of command while conducting operations. According to Watkin, operational factors cannot be put forward in order not to take feasible precautions in today’s trend, which pursues to compromise ‘human rights-like accountability frameworks with operational decision making during armed conflict’.⁹⁶ Accordingly, all members of the armed forces who are part of operations in cyberspace should do everything feasible within their limits.\nWhile assessing the individual responsibility of officers, they should be judged by how much they know about a certain subject. The well-known example is the Rendulic Decision, in which the Nuremberg Tribunal held that ‘the “scorched earth” policy in ⁸⁸ Sandoz, Swinarski and Zimmermann (eds) (fn 3) 2197; APV Rogers, ‘General Report-Conduct of Combat and Risks Run by the Civilian Population’ (1982) 21 Mil.

For this reason, later evidence which showed that ‘the danger did not actually exist’ cannot be used to convict the commander since he ‘acted within the limits of honest judgment on the basis of the conditions prevailing at the time’. This is crucial considering the interconnectivity of cyberspace since cyber attacks might affect civilian networks unexpectedly despite a commander’s employment of the advanced technology to conduct constant surveillance over a network. At this point, the responsibility arising out of a cyber attack would not go beyond what the defendant knew at the time of the attack.\nOn the other hand, one needs to distinguish misinformation from misconception. Misconception of the nature of the target might occur because of cognitive bias, which misdirects attackers by analyzing information ‘in a manner that supports their pre-existing beliefs or mental frameworks’. States should employ a variety of techniques such as ‘training and education, red teaming procedures, specific positive identification (PID) policies for targeting, use of structured analytic techniques, and other analytic tradecraft practices’ in order for this not to result in civilian damage. Despite the fact that states are keen to protect soldiers in such situations, inflicting civilian harm due to biased decisions does not very well fit with the notion of ‘honest judgement’.\nLastly, those who undertake cyber operations may be fully aware of the results of their actions owing to their technical expertise since cyberspace requires unique understanding compared to traditional domains. If a higher commander issues an order to launch a cyber operation without being aware of the outcomes in good faith, inferior commanders will be responsible for such intentional conduct. However, if a commander is aware that he lacks sufficient information about a target, he should either change the concept of the attack or refrain from issuing such an order. Should an operation continue to be carried out while being aware of this insufficiency, responsibility arises.\n\n---\n\n## ## 4.2 The segregation of civilian networks As it is indicated above, Article 58(a) of the AP-I requires parties to ‘endeavour to remove the civilian population, individual civilians and civilian objects under their control from the vicinity of military objectives’. The obligation should be applied when there is an immediate danger to civilians, and they should be evacuated them from the territory ‘where the risk of attack is greatest’.²³⁰ Even if this measure brings some difficulty to civilians, it aims to protect them from greater suffering, and alternative accommodations should be provided.²³¹ If these measures are not achieved, this can be deemed forced displacement and a violation of international law.\n\nWhilst the rule seems applicable when traditional battlefield is taken into account, it still creates some problems. For example, the rule was opposed by Switzerland because of its geographical conditions, where most civilians live in valleys in which important military facilities are located due to the limited number of useful locations in the country, so it becomes very hard to segregate civilians and civilian objects from the proximity of these facilities.²³² The same hardship is applicable for some facilities that can be important for both civilians and military personnel, such as air traffic control centres and power generation plants.²³³ On the other hand, the application of the rule in cyberspace brings more difficulty than in traditional domains. Civilian infrastructures are used for almost all cyber operations, and most of them have a dual nature.²³⁴ As an example, how can civilians be removed from cloud technology, which is also used for military purposes?²³⁵ Nevertheless, it is argued in a legal assessment published by the US Department of Defence that ‘[w]here there is a choice … military systems should be kept separate from ²²⁹.

The United States military uses multiple, dedicated networks to conduct administrative, logistical and operational activities. The three best-known networks are the Non-Classified Internet Protocol Router Network (NIPRnet, which carries information classified up to and including Sensitive but Unclassified), Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRnet, which carries data classified up to and including the Secret level) and the Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communication System (JWICS carries data classified up to and including Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information).²³⁹ As this example clearly shows, it is imperative to segregate the different types of networks, even if it can be costly.²⁴⁰ Otherwise, if the object makes an effective contribution and the segregation cannot be established, then the whole cyber infrastructure would be a lawful target.²⁴¹ Governmental and civilian data can be stored in the public cloud, despite the fact that this does not literally satisfy the criteria for segregation. However, the Russia-Ukraine War proved its usefulness in terms of reducing cyber dangers. The Ukrainian government moved an important part of the state’s digital infrastructure to the public cloud in preparation for Russian cyber operations against its governmental data center.²⁴² In this sense, cloud technology turns the disadvantage of cyber infrastructure’s interconnectedness into an advantage. As a more advanced example, the Estonian government established a ‘data embassy’ whose ‘resources are under Estonian state control, secured against cyberattacks or crisis situations with KSI [Keyless Signature Infrastructure] Blockchain technology, and are capable not only providing data backups, but also operating the most critical services’.²⁴³ The particular advantage of such precautions compared with network segregation is that they protect civilian data not only from cyber attacks but also from other types of crises that might occur within states’ borders, such as natural disasters or kinetic attacks.²⁴⁴ If such precautions impose a significant burden on the belligerent and are not feasible solutions, belligerent parties should search for other ways to shield civilian © 2023 The Author Journal compilation © 2023 Edward Elgar Publishing Ltd Downloaded from https://www.elgaronline.com/ at 07/16/2025 08:36:46PM via University College London (UCL)</https:> The Military Law and the Law of War Review, Vol. 61 No. 1 networks against cyber operations.²⁴⁵ The pertinent precaution could be the establishment of ‘digital safe havens’ through agreements between belligerent parties; while some systems may be difficult to negotiate due to their potential assistance to the adversary’s military effort, other systems critical to civilian life may be easily agreed upon.²⁴⁶ ## 4.3 The location of military objectives It is stated in Article 58(b) of the AP-I that belligerent parties should ‘avoid locating military objectives within or near densely populated areas’. From this perspective, parties to the conflict should refrain from locating both movable and immovable objects close to densely populated areas in order to protect civilians under their control.²⁴⁷ Nevertheless, the rule should not be limited to densely populated areas but also include ‘hospitals, cultural property, places of worship, prisoner of war camps, and other facilities which are entitled to specific protection’²⁴⁸ by refraining from locating cyber military objectives in or around them.\nWhile the applicability of the rule is understood in a physical sense, and social media or other similar civilian websites ‘cannot be equated with densely populated areas’, the rule obliges parties to take measures by considering cyber infrastructures which are physically located in the territory of a party.²⁴⁹ Therefore, for instance, army cyber commands should not be located in places where civilians or special protected objects can be put in danger. However, there is a significant hurdle to locating defence ministries in a place which is not close to densely populated areas. On the other hand, it is still possible for parties to exclude these kinds of facilities, which are military in nature but almost impossible to locate in isolated places, from the ambit of the attack through negotiation. Even if they cannot be attacked, it is possible for a party to conduct disruptive cyber operations against cyber infrastructures in these facilities. At this point, cyber operations give a unique opportunity to parties not to harm civilians but to still have an impact on the military capacity of their enemies.\n²⁴⁵.

For example, civilians might be supported by providing them with software products such as anti-virus programs that limit the damage from cyber attacks, detecting civilian cyber systems in order to warn people in case of intrusion attempts, providing them technical assistance when their computer systems are harmed, providing a back-up system to store civilian data, blocking particular IP addresses which pose risks to civilian systems, and keeping ready a system that makes it possible to disconnect an entire country from the Internet when all measures are exhausted.²⁵² While the title of Article 58 includes ‘attacks’, paragraph (c) clearly states that some precautions should be applied to operations. Although Jensen admits the ambiguity of this situation, he argues that countries which are not parties to the AP-I have responsibility arising from this provision for those acts that reach ‘attack’ threshold.²⁵³ In the Tallinn Manual, even though the majority of experts stated that the rule is applicable only to cyber attacks because of the title of the article and the non-existence of customary law, the minority focused on the wording of paragraph (c) by accepting cyber operations within the ambit of this rule.²⁵⁴ Therefore, the minority view kept the threshold lower, determined disruptive operations to be covered by this rule, and obligated parties to take precautions against the effects of these operations.²⁵⁵ However, both parties have a common understanding on the non-application of the rule to ‘mere inconvenience or irritation’.²⁵⁶ There is no clear-cut answer on which precautions should be taken within the ambit of Article 58(c), since the provision serves as a gap-filler in the article. Despite the fact that it did not receive much attention in the past because the suitability of other provisions for kinetic activities made them more visible than paragraph (c), their relative unsuitability for cyber operations rendered this clause more important. At this point, the implementation of the norm in cyberspace has already begun to be shaped by the practices of both state and non-state actors, and this trend seems to be continuing and getting better. For example, the US government has begun to warn private entities when they are subjected to transborder cyber attacks and has provided them with cyber tools and training to combat those attacks.²⁵⁷ Furthermore, the Security Service of Ukraine informs civilians about cyber threats and what measures to take in order to avoid them.²⁵⁸ As a recent innovative example, the ICRC has been conducting research on creating a ‘digital emblem’ for the past two years in order to enable the identification of objects, systems, or networks that cannot be subject to cyber attacks.²⁵⁹ Lastly, even though these are individual precautionary measures, the Russia-Ukraine War has also demonstrated how state and non-state entities can collaborate to © 2023 The Author Journal compilation © 2023 Edward Elgar Publishing Ltd Downloaded from https://www.elgaronline.com/ at 07/16/2025 08:36:46PM via University College London (UCL)</https:> The Military Law and the Law of War Review, Vol. 61 No. 1 protect civilians from the effects of cyber operations. The Microsoft Report highlights two examples of cyber security measures against Russian cyber activities: The first has been the use of technology acquired from RiskIQ that identifies and maps organizational attack surfaces, including devices that are unpatched against known vulnerabilities and therefore are the most susceptible to attack. This information has been shared with the Ukrainian government free of charge to enable it to accelerate the strengthening of cyber-defenses. Ukrainian network defenders worked tirelessly with the constant support of the CERT UA within the government to use this information to protect computers across the country.\nThe second measure has been a wartime innovation pursued with the collaboration and support of the Ukrainian government. MSTIC recognized that Russian malware could be mitigated meaningfully by turning on a feature in Microsoft Defender called controlled folder access. This typically would require that IT administrators access devices across their organization, work made more difficult and potentially even dangerous in wartime conditions. The Ukrainian government therefore authorized Microsoft through special legal measures to act proactively and remotely to turn on this feature across devices throughout the government and across the country.²⁶⁰ Every effort having a purpose to minimize collateral damage is desired in cyberspace; the principle of precaution essentially relies on the processes but not the results.",

However, despite its practical importance, the principle of precautions seems to trail behind the other two concepts.¹ This negligence extends not only to scholarly works but also to military doctrines. While the first two principles are often referred to as ‘principles’ in military manuals, the third does not have such a privilege.² Nonetheless, it not only confirms or supplements these former principles but also prescribes some preliminary measures to avoid violating them.³\n\nOn the other hand, the Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC) rules, which regulate the application of the principle of precautions, were designed to be applied during conventional warfare. Due to the interconnected nature of the cyber domain, however, it is difficult to apply these rules to cyber operations. Before discussing the complexity posed by the interconnectivity of cyberspace, it should be admitted that it is not unique to the cyber domain; traditional domains have this problem too. Almost half a century ago, the reality that there is ‘a geographical and functional mixture of combatants and civilians and military objectives and civilian objects’ in the conduct of military air\n\n1.

    "The application of the principle of precautions to cyber operations 5\n\noperations was discussed, and the importance of taking precautionary measures was emphasized in a pamphlet published by the United States (US) Air Force.⁴ Despite the similarity between the traditional and cyber domains in terms of interconnectivity, what makes interconnectivity special regarding cyber military operations is that it ‘characterises cyberspace, which means that whatever has an interface with the Internet can be affected by cyber operations conducted from anywhere in the world’.⁵ In such a complex environment, the adoption of the principle of precautions while planning and executing cyber operations has utmost importance.\n\nThe interconnectivity problem should be approached from two perspectives, taking into account both the technical and the social factors. From the first standpoint, technical factors intensify the interconnectedness between military and civilian networks in cyberspace, therefore converting this domain into one of entirely dual-use nature and obstructing the distinction between military targets and civilian objects. As Jensen points out, ‘[w]ith 98% of day-to-day government communications routinely travelling over civilian communication lines, there will be many civilian lines of communication that will carry targetable electronic traffic intermixed with civilian traffic’.⁶ From this vantage point, not only is it highly difficult to make a certain distinction between civilian and military cyber infrastructures, but practically all military cyber activities must be carried out through dual-use cyber systems.⁷ In the absence of precautionary measures against such interconnectivity, the impacts of cyber activities might quickly spread to other systems across the globe and have the potential to significantly disrupt daily civilian life by having adverse impacts on civilian critical infrastructure and other associated systems.⁸ From this point of view, a cyber operation designed to disrupt a dual-used power plant located in a belligerent state could easily impair other systems, from water and food to ICT infrastructure, and its unintended effects might spill over into neutral countries.⁹\n\nFrom the second point of view, interconnection becomes a more complicated matter when social factors are considered. Even though they are less obvious than technical ones, they still pose threats comparable to those of the latter, and it necessitates especially defensive parties to take unique precautionary measures. Therefore, it has been\n\n4. US Department of the Air Force, AF Pamphlet 110-31: International Law – The Conduct of Armed Conflict and Air Operations (1976) 5–10.\n5.

This perspective would reveal just how many components are connected and demonstrate the levels of complexity in a facility’.¹⁰ This entails that the human workforce of a facility needs to be considered in terms of the complexity of the system’s network. When this fact about a single facility is considered along with the global challenge of interconnectivity, the magnitude of the interconnectivity issue could be better understood.\n\nGiven that measures to prevent adversarial effects on cyber systems cannot keep up with their level of interconnectivity,¹¹ this article aims to portray how to apply the principle of precautions to cyber operations and answers this question by taking its humanity-based character into account. The present author acknowledges that the articles articulating the principle of precautions are vague, as stated by state delegates during the negotiations of Additional Protocol-I or by state legal advisers.¹² Such views on specific provisions of the article or the article as a whole are expressed using terms like ‘open to a variety of interpretations by the conflicting parties’¹³ (for Article 57(2)(a)(ii)), ‘subjective’¹⁴ ‘ambiguous’¹⁵ (for Article 57(2)(a)), ‘deficient in clarity due to its generally vague wording’¹⁶ (for Article 57), and ‘too general’¹⁷ (for articles between 48 and 58). Moreover, delegates emphasized the hardships posed by applying these provisions in practice.¹⁸ When the complexity of cyberspace interconnectivity is combined with the ambiguity of the articles, applying the principle of precautions appears to bring together two ‘unknown unknowns’ in order to reach one ‘known known’.¹⁹ Throughout this piece of research, the author attempts to emphasize the humanity-based character of the principle of precautions in order to convert this ambiguity into a flexibility to apply the rules more effectively.²⁰\n\nThe LOAC, in general, aims to achieve a balance between military necessity and humanity.²¹ From this perspective, it is accepted that some harm will occur; on the\n\n10.

In other words, ‘[t]he thrust is not absolute elimination of the calamities of war (a goal which would manifestly be utopian), but relief from the tribulations of war “as much as possible” bearing in mind that war is fought to be won’.²² At this point, it sounds rational that these two notions should be balanced while applying the principles governing the conduct of hostilities.\n\nOn the other hand, considering the peculiarity of interconnectedness in cyberspace, this balance should be leaned toward humanity while applying the principle of precautions. There are some reasons in favour of such an interpretation. To begin with, the notion of ‘balance’ is significantly subjective.²³ From a practitioner perspective, when the armed conflict starts, reality does not permit such a compromise,²⁴ and the perception of ‘balance’ is determined by those on the battlefield. However, outside of the conflict, such a balance could be perceived differently by scholars or judges who need to evaluate the legality of such actions, and their views seem more ‘humanitarian’ to practitioners. As stated by Luban, ‘[f]or military lawyers, the starting point is military necessity, and the reigning assumption is that legal regulation of war must accommodate military necessity. For humanitarian lawyers, the starting point is human dignity and human rights’.²⁵ As a result, such disparities in viewpoints considerably alter the perception of balance, and trying to achieve a balance in the principle of precautions seems to be a rhetorical word.\n\nApart from the subjectivity of balance depending on different perceptors, the nature of the LOAC principles inherently provides a lean toward either military necessity or humanity.²⁶ While the principles of distinction and proportionality are more eligible to\n\nmore generally’. See A Sari and K Tinkler, ‘Collateral Damage and the Enemy’ (2019) British Yearbook of International Law 63. From the standpoint of this article, military necessity is held as a permission giving to a belligerent party in order to ‘apply any amount and kind of force to compel the complete submission of the enemy with the least possible expenditure of time, life, and money’ by not violating the LOAC. See The Hostage Case, Case No. 7 (United States v. Wilhelm List et al.), (Opinion and Judgment and Sentence) [1949] 1253 (‘The Hostage Case’). Pictet defines humanity as ‘a sentiment of active goodwill towards mankind’ by referring to Littré’s dictionary. See J Pictet, The Fundamental Principles of the Red Cross (1956) 143. By considering this definition, this article holds the principle of humanity as a ‘guiding principle that puts a brake on undertakings which might otherwise be justified by the principle of military necessity’.

The crux of the former principles is based on gaining military advantage on the battlefield,²⁷ and the notion of military advantage ‘has a particular resonance with “military necessity”’.²⁸ This naturally bends those principles’ interpretation in the direction of military necessity.²⁹ On the other hand, the central tenet of the principle of precautions is based on the minimization of civilian harm. It obliges belligerent parties to take active or passive precautionary measures to mitigate risks, which derive from military operations, towards civilians and civilian property in armed conflicts.³⁰ In line with this, it is not good enough for soldiers ‘merely not intending civilian harm’, but they also ‘must intend not to harm civilians’.³¹\n\nGiven that the nature of the principles requires that they be construed by leaning towards one side, analyzing the principle of precautions by considering the balance poses a risk that it turns into an ‘illusory rule’. According to Schwarzenberger:\n\n[Illusory rules]... are merely a formal compromise between the standard of civilization and the necessities of war. Here, in fact the rule of force is supreme. Rules which expressly proclaim the necessities of war as an overriding constituent element or are emasculated by an ‘as far as possible’ clause illustrate this perhaps slightly hypocritical variant of the rules of warfare.³²\n\nThus, by turning the principle into an ‘illusory rule’, it would be very easy for belligerent parties to refrain from effectively applying the principle of precautions by putting terms such as ‘feasible’ or ‘unless circumstances do not permit’ on the table.³³ To preclude such excuses, one should hold it as a rule that ‘sets limitations to warfare in cases in which considerations of civilization demand priority over military interest’.³⁴ As correctly held by the Madagascar delegate, ‘[t]he article reflected a laudable desire to narrow the gap between the ideal and the possible, and to deal from a humanitarian standpoint with two opposite positions, namely, the aggressor’s and the victim’s’.³⁵ Per this point of view, the application of the principle of precautions by taking ‘one small step’ toward humanity could be ‘one giant leap’ toward a more appropriate\n\n²⁷.

When the inherent bending of these principles toward military necessity and only their recognition as ‘principles’ in military manuals are considered, the consequence is admitted by Maurer that ‘[i]n more than one context, the balance between military “necessity” and protection concerns has heavily tilted towards military logics, and norms have been implicitly downgraded to mere discretionary guidance’.

In section 3, the precautions that shall be taken by the attacking side of the conflict according to Article 57 of Additional Protocol-I will be examined. In the first part of the section, target verification in cyber operations will be discussed, and some important questions will be answered, e.g., does technical superiority play any role on the precautionary level? Or what is the requisite level of certainty? In the second part, the choice of cyber means and methods will be addressed. The proportionality rule in precautions in planning and executing cyber attacks will be determined in the third part. Not only will key terms such as ‘military advantage’ and ‘incidental harm’ be discussed in that section, but also some grey areas, e.g., the consideration of indirect effects. The fourth part will explain effective warning before launching cyber attacks, and the final part will explain the least-danger rule. In the fourth section, precautions that shall be taken by a party that is subject to cyber operations will be addressed. In this chapter, the segregation of civilian and military objectives in cyberspace, the location of cyber military objectives, and other measures will be questioned, respectively.\n\n## 2 THE REGULATION OF THE PRINCIPLE OF PRECAUTIONS, BASIC TERMS AND RESPONSIBILITY\n\n### 2.1 The regulation of the principle of precautions\n\nWhile it is not stated conspicuously, the first implication of the principle of precautions can be found in Article 27 of the Hague Convention IV, in which it is stated that:\n\nIn sieges and bombardments all necessary steps must be taken to spare, as far as possible, buildings dedicated to religion, art, science, or charitable purposes, historic monuments, hospitals, and places where the sick and wounded are collected, provided they are not being used at the time for military purposes.³⁷\n\nIn the following process, the prohibition to launch an attack against civilians and to spare them as much as possible found a place in various official documents.³⁸ However, the first binding regulation of the principle of precautions appeared in the AP-I,\n\n³⁶. ‘The principles of distinction, precautions and proportionality thus complement each other in a way that achieves a subtle balance between military necessity and humanitarian imperatives.’ See Sari and Tinkler (fn 21) 4.\n\n³⁷.

Despite the fact that states did not adopt these rules, they had an impact on the rules codified in Additional Protocols.

    "The Military Law and the Law of War Review, Vol. 61 No. 1\n\nin which it is stated that both attacking and defending parties shall take precautions to spare civilians and civilian objects in an armed conflict. At this point, for *jus in bello* cyberspace operations, the principle of precautions provides a twofold protection: the first comprises taking constant care while conducting cyber attacks ('precautions in attack'), and the second comprises taking feasible precautions in order to protect civilians from the effects of cyber attacks ('precautions against the effects of attacks') during armed conflicts. These precautions can also be named 'active' and 'passive' precautions ruled under Articles 57 and 58 of the AP-I.\n\nThe rules stated in Articles 57 and 58 are applied in times of armed conflicts, though the definition of 'armed conflict' is not provided in the Protocol. In this article, the definition given in the Tadic Decision, in which it was described as 'a resort to armed force between States or protracted armed violence between governmental authorities and organized armed groups or between such groups within a State',[39] is adopted. From this definition, it can be stated that there are two types of armed conflicts; 'between States' (international armed conflicts), and 'between governmental authorities and organized armed groups or between such groups' (non-international armed conflicts). In identifying the nature of the conflict, the status of the actors is the decisive factor.[40] The importance of this distinction is that while the AP-I, which is applicable to international armed conflicts, clearly states the obligation to take precautions, there is no clear provision which regulates the principle of precautions in Additional Protocol-II,[41] which is applicable to non-international armed conflicts. However, it does not prevent the application of the principle to the latter type of conflicts since it is stated in Article 13(1) of the AP-II that '[t]he civilian population and individual civilians shall enjoy general protection against the dangers arising from military operations'. Therefore, it is argued in the work of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) on Customary Rules that, by approving the customary nature of the principle for both international and non-international armed conflict, it is hard to abide by such a rule without taking any precaution.[42] Moreover, it is stated in the Tadic Decision that 'all necessary precautions should be taken to avoid injury, loss or damage to civilian populations' in all kinds of armed conflicts by referring to a resolution adopted by the United Nations General Assembly.[43] Finally, two recent treaties that are applicable to non-international armed conflicts explicitly regulate the principle of precautions.[44]\n\n39.

    "The application of the principle of precautions to cyber operations 11\n\nIt is crucial to make the distinction between military operations and attacks since some precautions are applicable to all military operations, as stated in Article 57 (1) and (4), though others can only be applied to attacks.⁴⁵ However, when these provisions are read together with Article 49, it might cause confusion in the first instance because while Article 49(3) clearly restricts the application of Section IV rules of the AP-I to operations conducted in the air or sea which have impacts on ‘civilians or civilian objects on land’, Article 57(4) seems to obligate parties to respect the principle of precautions in the conduct of these operations without any limitation. To solve this problem, one should deem Article 57(4) as ‘merely a restatement of one of the existing rules’.⁴⁶ As Article 49(3) makes clear, the article does not affect those rules that are customary in nature and applicable to all types of military operations. Therefore, Article 57(4) does not contradict but rather ‘complement’ it.⁴⁷\n\nSince the principle of precautions applies to both operations and attacks, both of these terms should be clarified. At this point, military operations are ‘any movements, manoeuvres and other activities whatsoever carried out by the armed forces with a view to combat’.⁴⁸ Therefore, all parties to the conflict should exercise constant care while conducting their military operations. For instance, if a tank driver harms civilian property while maneuvering the vehicle, he/she will be responsible due to the breach of the principle of precautions.⁴⁹ From this perspective, if a perpetrator destroys a civilian network while conducting cyber exploitation against either a civilian or military cyber system, he/she will bear responsibility. However, military attacks require a certain threshold since they are violent acts causing death, injury, damage, or destruction – or at least intending to do so.⁵⁰ As a result, all military attacks are kinds of military operations but vice versa would not be true. Therefore, while cyber operation can be defined as ‘the employment of cyber capabilities to achieve objectives in or through cyberspace’,⁵¹ cyber attack is ‘a cyber operation, whether offensive or defensive, that is reasonably expected to cause injury or death to persons or damage or destruction to objects’.⁵² In light of this, cyber attack is a special kind of cyber operation that results in violent effects. However, cyber attacks require a broader understanding because damage to objects may occur as a secondary effect of cyber operations. Therefore, the present author agrees with the approach of the majority of the International Group of Experts (the Experts), who prepared the Tallinn Manual, that cyber operations that result in the replacement of a component by having an impact on the functionality of an object fall within the ambit of attack because, while these kinds of operations do not damage an object in the first instance, their effects in later phases reach the threshold of attack by causing physical harm.⁵³\n\n⁴⁵.

    "The Military Law and the Law of War Review, Vol. 61 No. 1\n\nTo sum up, there is no rule which prohibits developing and using cyber capabilities, but ‘states are obliged to ensure their use of cyber capabilities accords with international law and norms of acceptable behaviour’⁵⁴ including relevant rules of the LOAC. At this point, the applicability of international law to cyber operations is recognized by states and international organizations.⁵⁵ Also, there is a certain difference between a cyber operation and an attack, and not all precautionary measures are applicable to all kinds of cyber operations.\n\n## 2.2 Constant care\n\nAccording to Article 57(1) of the AP-I, the attacking party shall always take ‘constant care’ to spare civilians and civilian objects while conducting military operations. The term ‘constant care’ is clarified in the HPCR Manual Commentary by stating that ‘there are no exceptions from the duty to seek to spare the civilian population, civilians and civilian objects’.⁵⁶ Therefore, constant care obliges all levels of the armed forces who are responsible for planning, ordering or executing a cyber operation to always consider the results of it and try to minimize its effects on civilians.⁵⁷\n\nThe ‘constant care’ obligation is necessary for cyber operations. Those who are involved in the operation should always be aware of the foreseeable effects of operations on the civilian population and property and try to minimize these effects as much as possible. For this reason, it is not enough to demonstrate due care in the planning stage; this obligation extends to all stages of the operation in which civilians might be affected. In other words, these people should have ‘situational awareness at all times’.⁵⁸ The concept of situational awareness is explained in the Allied Joint Doctrine for Cyberspace Operations by describing it as ‘a combination of a near real-time updated RCP [Recognised Cyberspace Picture], analysis and information management’.⁵⁹ Although the obligation is constrained by the execution stage of an operation as described in the article, the effects of the attack can continue.

    "The application of the principle of precautions to cyber operations 13\n\nStuxnet case, even though the malware was exclusively designed to target SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) systems of the Iranian nuclear facility and the production of energy was reduced significantly, the malware spread around the world without the intention of its creators.⁶⁰ Although Jensen notes that this ‘at least implicates the constant-care standard and informs State practice on the issue’,⁶¹ the present author considers that the possible effects of the cyber operations after their execution are better understood 10 years later, so states should seek to stop or at least limit the effects of operations after their military objective is accomplished.\n\nOn the other hand, the application of the rule in cyberspace poses a significant hurdle since almost all cyber operations might affect or harm civilian cyber infrastructure to some extent.⁶² However, after all feasible precautions have been taken by an attacker, the relevant rule will be proportionality. If the effects of the operation on civilians are not excessive compared to the anticipated military advantage, then the attacking party may continue to carry out cyber operations. However, the calculation may be difficult because of the time-sensitivity. Planned operations give more chance to the attacking party to take better precautions, though time-sensitive ones generally do not permit sufficient time to implement more suitable precautions.⁶³ Although the impact of such a condition on precautions is not deniable, it does not give permission to the attacker to deviate from the principle because the constant care obligation necessitates parties to take feasible precautions in all circumstances.⁶⁴\n\nThe second significant hurdle might be the secretive nature of cyberspace since ambiguity is at the centre of cyber warfare.⁶⁵ Even though attribution may be difficult in that domain and the perpetrator of cyber acts that violate the LOAC cannot be easily found, parties to the conflict should obey the rules of the LOAC by considering warrior ethics. From this perspective, cyber warriors should always seek ways to mitigate risks towards civilians in good faith since ‘[r]espect for LOAC obligations is the essential touchstone for that ethical foundation’.⁶⁶ This ethical foundation serves for better protection of civilians, which is an inherent objective of the LOAC.⁶⁷\n\nLast but not least, the ‘constant care’ obligation should not be accepted as limited to this article. It involves all phases of operations and attacks, which are carried out by both attacking and defending parties. For this reason, it has a guidance function while examining all provisions of Articles 57 and 58.\n\n## 2.3 Feasibility\n\nArticle 57 obliges parties to take ‘feasible’ precautions in order to minimize the effects of an attack on civilians and civilian objects. In the Official Commentary of Article 57, it is stated that those precautions are ‘everything that was practicable or practically possible, taking into account all the circumstances at the time of the attack, including\n\n⁶⁰.

At this point, every situation has its unique features, and those responsible for an attack should adapt various precautions by considering the characteristics of the situation. For example, an attacker party should map the target network through exploitation operations if it is connected to other civilian networks.71 In such situations, LOAC not only permits cyber espionage but also obligates a belligerent party to conduct these operations. However, such operations require a certain level of technical expertise, and in the absence of that, such a network should not be exploited.72 Despite such expertise, some mistakes may occur in the 'fog of war'.73 At this point, a commander who took 'all due measures' is not responsible for this harm.74 Those measures can be identified by different factors such as available cyber means, time sensitivity, the cyber defence system of the enemy, the characteristics of the target, intelligence assets, the expertise of the attacking team, the loyalty of the enemy of to the LOAC, and available assets and vulnerabilities of the enemy.75 However, even if feasible precautions are taken, unintended results may occur for various reasons, such as failure of the intelligence system, dysfunction of the technology, or unexpected changes in tactical conditions.76 For instance, a commander might prepare a map of a cyber network before conducting an attack, but the virus unintentionally spreads among the civilian infrastructure, which has a connection with the military network.77 At this point, while deciding on whether the principle of precautions is respected or not, one should not focus on outcomes, but compliance should be measured by the process in which an\n\n68.

    "The application of the principle of precautions to cyber operations 15\n\nattacking party makes diligent efforts.⁷⁸ For instance, if an attacker has advanced cyber capabilities that make it possible to disrupt an electrical grid without harming civilians but prefers to carry out an attack by conventional means – which results in civilian damage – it cannot claim that its adversary does not use the same level of technology to refrain from harming civilians.⁷⁹ Thus, it is true that each party has a responsibility ‘within its means or methods or its capability’ as stated by the Indian delegate.⁸⁰\n\nEven if the commander has advanced cyber weapons, he/she may try to spare them for use during later stages of the conflict by taking military considerations into account. Therefore, it is permitted for the military commander in the Naval Manual of Ecuador to use alternative methods ‘in light of all the facts known or reasonably available to him, including the need to conserve resources and complete the mission successfully’.⁸¹ However, if it is understood that using less advanced weapons will result in excessive collateral damage, then they should either use advanced ones or cancel the attack.⁸²\n\nOn the other hand, the determination of feasibility on a contextual basis should not be used to assuage the burden from the shoulders of the attacker. For example, the use of white phosphorus shells near al-Wafa hospital, where patients have serious injuries and need long-term care, by the Israeli armed forces was deemed a violation of Articles 57(2)(b) and (c) of the AP-I.⁸³ It was stated that those who were responsible for the attack should be aware of ‘all the facts and circumstances’.⁸⁴ For this reason, while conducting a cyber operation against a system in which some medical records may be located, the attacking party should take special care. The same is valid for facilities such as dams, where dangerous forces are located.⁸⁵\n\n## 2.4 Responsibility\n\nThe wording of Article 57 restricts its applicability to ‘those who plan or decide upon an attack’. Because of this wording, some states have expressed reservations about Article 57, claiming that it only applies to ‘commanding officers at the battalion or group level and those of higher ranks’.⁸⁶ Nonetheless, every soldier who breaches obligations imposed by the LOAC bears individual criminal responsibility for his/her acts when such crimes are committed with ‘intent and knowledge’.⁸⁷ At this point, it does\n\n⁷⁸.

According to Watkin, operational factors cannot be put forward in order not to take feasible precautions in today’s trend, which pursues to compromise ‘human rights-like accountability frameworks with operational decision making during armed conflict’.⁹⁶ Accordingly, all members of the armed forces who are part of operations in cyberspace should do everything feasible within their limits.\n\nWhile assessing the individual responsibility of officers, they should be judged by how much they know about a certain subject.

For this reason, later evidence which showed that ‘the danger did not actually exist’$^{98}$ cannot be used to convict the commander since he ‘acted within the limits of honest judgment on the basis of the conditions prevailing at the time’.$^{99}$ This is crucial considering the interconnectivity of cyberspace since cyber attacks might affect civilian networks unexpectedly despite a commander’s employment of the advanced technology to conduct constant surveillance over a network.$^{100}$ At this point, the responsibility arising out of a cyber attack would not go beyond what the defendant knew at the time of the attack.\n\nOn the other hand, one needs to distinguish misinformation from misconception. Misconception of the nature of the target might occur because of cognitive bias, which misdirects attackers by analyzing information ‘in a manner that supports their pre-existing beliefs or mental frameworks’.$^{101}$ States should employ a variety of techniques such as ‘training and education, red teaming procedures, specific positive identification (PID) policies for targeting, use of structured analytic techniques, and other analytic tradecraft practices’ in order for this not to result in civilian damage.$^{102}$ Despite the fact that states are keen to protect soldiers in such situations,$^{103}$ inflicting civilian harm due to biased decisions does not very well fit with the notion of ‘honest judgement’.\n\nLastly, those who undertake cyber operations may be fully aware of the results of their actions owing to their technical expertise since cyberspace requires unique understanding compared to traditional domains. If a higher commander issues an order to launch a cyber operation without being aware of the outcomes in good faith, inferior commanders will be responsible for such intentional conduct.

    "The Military Law and the Law of War Review, Vol. 61 No. 1\n\nmeaning of paragraph 2 of Article 52 and that it is not prohibited by the provisions of this Protocol to attack them.\n\nThe rationale behind this provision is to prevent carrying out attacks against objectives that are not military in nature because of misinformation or against military objectives in order to get a small military advantage by significantly harming civilians and objects.^[105]^\n\nThe binding definition of military objectives is codified in Article 52(2) of the AP-I, which states that:\n\n[M]ilitary objectives are limited to those objects which by their nature, location, purpose or use make an effective contribution to military action and whose total or partial destruction, capture or neutralization, in the circumstances ruling at the time, offers a definite military advantage.\n\nFrom this definition, there must be two cumulative elements ('two-pronged test')^[106]^ in order to deem an object as military, which are effective contribution and military advantage. For this reason, an object that is military in nature should not be subject to attack if it does not effectively contribute to the military capacity of an enemy.^[107]^\n\nWhile only Article 52(2) of the AP-I has found its place in the provision, lawful targets also include people who can be made the object of direct cyber attacks. According to the LOAC, various categories of people can be held as lawful targets. The first one consists of combatants who are members of the armed forces and have a right to directly participate in hostilities.^[108]^ Even though they are lawful targets, they have a right to be treated as prisoners of war when they are captured by the enemy.^[109]^\n\nThe second category includes direct participants in hostilities. Although they are civilian in nature, they will be accepted as lawful targets if they meet three cumulative criteria which are: threshold of harm, direct causation and belligerent nexus.^[110]^ Those people are lawful targets 'for such time as they take a direct part in hostilities',^[111]^ and if they are captured, they cannot benefit from prisoner of war status.\n\nThe third category, though there is a discussion on it, consists of members of an organized armed group that is a belligerent party in an armed conflict. They are 'individuals whose continuous function involves the preparation, execution, or command of acts or operations amounting to direct participation in hostilities'.^[112]^\n\n105.

    "The application of the principle of precautions to cyber operations 19\n\nAt first glance, the second and third categories may seem identical, but the difference is that while civilians who fall into the former categories ‘directly participate in hostilities on a merely spontaneous, sporadic, or unorganized basis’, the latter category of people has a continuous combat function, which ‘requires lasting integration into an organised armed group acting as the armed forces of a non-state party to an armed conflict’.¹¹³ The result of this distinction is that those who directly participate in hostilities lose their protected status only for a limited period of time, but the last category of individuals loses it ‘as long as they remain members’, and this membership renders them lawful targets ‘even before he or she first carries out a hostile act’.¹¹⁴\n\nAfter it was stated in the Official Commentary that the military commander does not need to have personal knowledge, it was argued that even if there is a ‘slight doubt’, additional information shall be obtained.¹¹⁵ By supporting it, Rogers points out that ‘[i]n the event of doubt about the nature of the target, an attack should not be carried out, with a possible exception where failure to prosecute the attack would put attacking forces in immediate danger’.¹¹⁶ However, this approach is challenged by some states, which claim that the determination should be ‘substantial doubt’¹¹⁷ to suspend an attack and require supplementary information. In the same vein, various authors claimed that conducting military operations without having a doubt on the nature of a target is not a reasonable expectation in the fog of war.¹¹⁸ From this perspective, there is always some doubt as an inherent characteristic of combat. On the other hand, the present author thinks that the Official Commentary should be interpreted as the aim of a commander. By stating the ‘slight doubt’ requirement, the commentary obligates them to take better precautions even if it is possible to erase this doubt. This is approved by military practice, in which attacks are cancelled when combatants are not ‘certain’¹¹⁹ or ‘100 percent sure of their aiming point’.¹²⁰ According to Parks, the US achieved this level of accuracy during the Linebacker II campaign by constantly confirming the nature of targets, implementing rules set by the Strategic Air Command, and issuing bomb damage assessments after each attack.¹²¹ Despite the fact that such high-level precautions sometimes pose substantial risks to the combatants’ lives, he acknowledges that they are important not only in terms of legality but also for achieving military and political objectives.¹²² By considering such positive outcomes, a commander should be sure enough that he/she made reasonable efforts to verify the nature of the target in cyberspace.¹²³\n\n113.

    "The Military Law and the Law of War Review, Vol. 61 No. 1\n\nLastly, the dual nature of cyber systems might cause an attacker to identify only one particular part of the target as military, and the determination of other parts may remain unclear. At this point, cyber attack should be limited to that component, which is military in nature.¹²⁴ If it is not possible, then the attack should be cancelled. However, this should not be equated with being ‘perfectly familiar with the network’¹²⁵ since such an interpretation is not appropriate with the term ‘feasible’.\n\n## 3.2 Choice of cyber means and methods\n\nAfter the nature of the target is verified, the next step will be to compose an operational plan that will have a minimum effect on civilians. At this point, it is stated in Article 57 (2)(a)(ii) of the AP-I that members of the armed forces should ‘take all feasible precautions in the choice of means and methods of attack with a view to avoiding, and in any event to minimising, incidental loss or civilian life, injury to civilians and damage to civilian objects’. This means that even if an attack is proportionate, parties to the conflict should be careful in their choice of means and methods in order to minimize the effects of attacks as much as possible while still aiming to obtain maximum military advantage. At this point, an attacking party should produce a plan that promises to give the most efficient operational and legal results.¹²⁶\n\nIt is important to define ‘cyber means’ and ‘methods’. Cyber means are defined as ‘cyber weapons and their associated cyber systems’¹²⁷ in the Tallinn Manual. At this point, cyber weapons are kinds of cyber means, but the latter includes a broader category. Cyber methods, on the other hand, are defined as ‘the cyber tactics, techniques, and procedures by which hostilities are conducted’.¹²⁸ Whilst cyber means are concerned with which tools should be employed to carry out cyber operations, cyber methods are concerned with how these operations should be carried out.¹²⁹ Based on this viewpoint, while botnets are a type of cyber means, the DDoS attack that is conducted by botnets can be considered a type of cyber method.¹³⁰\n\nThere is no weapon or method that is specifically prohibited in the provision. It only obliges parties to take feasible precautions by choosing appropriate means and methods; thereby, a commander will not be responsible for causing civilian harm. However, the rule does not require parties to choose means and methods that may decrease their expected military advantage.¹³¹ Even if alternative means and methods are not used because of this concern, a planned cyber attack must abide by other principles such as distinction and proportionality.¹³² On the other hand, if choosing different means and methods may change the degree of damage by producing ‘equivalent effects’ upon the target, then alternative means or methods shall be selected.¹³³ A facility where armed forces of a belligerent party conduct cyber attacks against the enemy,\n\n¹²⁴.

    "The application of the principle of precautions to cyber operations 21\n\nfor example, can be attacked by kinetic means. However, this may result in civilian deaths who live in the vicinity of the facility. At this point, if an attacking party has available means to conduct a cyber attack, it shall use them against the system or computers in the facility to stop belligerent attacks. Additionally, military personnel’s expertise with those new technologies is crucial. The concern was raised in the Eritrea-Ethiopia Claims Commission. Even though Eritrea refused Ethiopia’s allegations that some of its aircraft intentionally attacked civilians, the inexperience of Eritrean pilots in using ‘computerized aiming systems’, which led to the failure to target military objectives, was held as a violation of Article 57 of the AP-I.¹³⁴ Lastly, a ‘target list’ can be prepared and constantly reviewed by belligerent parties in order to determine which type of weapon should be used to decrease civilian harm by considering the characteristics of the target.¹³⁵ For example, the bombardment of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) compound by the Israeli Armed Forces, which resulted in extensive damage and endangered the lives of many civilians, was accepted as reckless conduct and a violation of Article 57(2)(a)(ii) of the AP-I since it was executed while being aware of its importance for civilians.¹³⁶ However, in the Vietnam War, the US employed fragmentation bombs that had limited effects on the target to execute attacks against anti-aircraft batteries; since these batteries were located inside dikes, the army tried to refrain from damaging them.¹³⁷\n\nThe accuracy and range of weapons also have a particular importance in the execution of attacks.¹³⁸ If a target can be destroyed by accurate weapons, then it does not make sense to use dumb bombs or other means whose effects may not be calculated properly or limited. In this sense, the US practice in the Linebacker II campaign is important. During the campaign, the B-52s that have wide-range effects were employed because of weather conditions and the limited number of the more precise weapons.¹³⁹ But to keep the collateral damage to a minimum, the B-52s were used against targets that were either sufficiently large or in military-industrial complexes.¹⁴⁰ Other objectives requiring pinpoint strikes, such as bridges and railroad yards, were hit by more precise weapons when weather conditions permitted, which was limited to 12 hours during the 12-day campaign.¹⁴¹\n\nAs such practice in a highly interconnected battle arena demonstrates, cyber means and weapons should be used against adversaries while always considering their accuracy and range. When it would not be possible to precisely damage a cyber target that is interconnected with a civilian network, they should be used against military cyber networks, or at least those networks whose destruction does not have a significant impact on civilians. In this manner, a cyber mean can be designed to affect only a specific type of system, as it was in the Stuxnet incident, in which malware only affected the SCADA systems.\n\n¹³⁴.

    "The Military Law and the Law of War Review, Vol. 61 No. 1\n\nThe employment of this type of smart malware having the capability of ‘system-fencing’ is recommended in the ICRC Report.¹⁴² The term refers to malware that is able to ‘recognize the environment it finds itself in and then execute itself only if the target system precisely matches that environment’.¹⁴³ Recent events demonstrate that states follow this trend by using precise cyber means.¹⁴⁴ At this point, the Russia-Ukraine War is of particular importance, and it should be carefully examined.\n\nIn the report prepared by Microsoft (the Microsoft Report), it is claimed that:\n\nRussian cyber tactics in the war have differed from those deployed in the NotPetya attack against Ukraine in 2017. That attack used ‘wormable’ destructive malware that could jump from one computer domain to another and hence cross borders into other countries. Russia has been careful in 2022 to confine destructive ‘wiper software’ to specific network domains inside Ukraine itself. But the recent and ongoing destructive attacks themselves have been sophisticated and more widespread than many reports recognize. And the Russian army is continuing to adapt these destructive attacks to changing war needs, including by coupling cyberattacks with the use of conventional weapons.¹⁴⁵\n\nThis passage raises two concerns. First, which types of cyber means are used? Second, excluding other considerations such as political or military ones, why did the Russians allegedly employ such means in an armed conflict while adhering to the LOAC?\n\nAs an answer to the first question, the Microsoft Report lists cyber means that were used or are in use in the Russia-Ukraine War:\n\n1.

    "The application of the principle of precautions to cyber operations 23\n\nof all malware are limited to cyberspace. This brings an important issue to the surface. Even though the debate exists, operations causing such damage do not constitute attacks in terms of *lex lata*. Therefore, it would not be possible to apply Article 57 (2)(a)(ii) to those malwares since the rule encompasses means of warfare that are ‘used, designed, or intended to be used to conduct a cyber attack’.¹⁴⁸ Then the question would be why Russia needs to employ such discriminatory cyber means.\n\nFrom the present author’s perspective, the war demonstrated that the key benefit of using cyber means in warfare is their adaptability, instead of previous assumptions that cyber operations provide a belligerent party an advantage owing to their low cost or non-attributability. As stated in the report, Russia adapted such means to ‘changing war needs’.¹⁴⁹ This adaptation should be seen from two perspectives: cyber and kinetic. The former is important from a technical standpoint, and the latter is important from a legal standpoint, but both of them need to be examined because of their importance from a military standpoint.\n\nEven though it does not have a direct relationship with the legality of cyber means in terms of Article 57(2)(a)(ii), the technical standing point is important to understand why parties adopt cyber means in armed conflicts. Every new step in technology has the potential to threaten the kinetic weapon supremacy of an adversary. For example, the invention of a new type of surface-to-air missile system can erase the advantage of the adversary’s aircraft, and the attacking party needs to make a huge investment to improve its aircraft and produce new ones to establish a new squadron. On the other hand, the adaptability of cyber means makes it possible for past used malware to escape from such quick elimination. By adding some extra codes, a cyber weapon can be adjusted based on a new type of cyber security measure, and such modification can turn it into a new type of weapon. As stated by the ICRC, ‘it is possible for offensive cyber capabilities to be reverse-engineered or repurposed so that they can be reused. This is also the case for some traditional weapon systems, but the technical characteristics of cyberspace raise these concerns in a unique manner’.¹⁵⁰ This uniqueness has been and continues to be demonstrated in the Russia-Ukraine War. Numerous reports claim that Russia used or is using malware by modifying previously used ones. In other words, cyber security updates also bring updates to those malwares, and they are adapted to changing needs in the cyber environment. For example, AcidRain, a wiper malware used to disrupt the VIASAT satellite, shares some characteristics with VPNFilter, a kind of malware used by Russia-backed cyber-organized groups in 2018.¹⁵¹ Also, such modifications do not have to take a long time. Shortly after the intrusion of WhisperGate into Ukrainian systems and its detection by cyber security companies, Russia altered it and developed a new type of malware, Hermeticwiper, that ‘has some similarities to the earlier WhisperGate’.¹⁵² This shows that detecting malware and taking defensive measures against it do not make such malware useless, but certain parts of the codes can still be used by belligerents to improve their cyber capabilities owing to their adaptability.\n\n¹⁴⁸.

    "The Military Law and the Law of War Review, Vol. 61 No. 1\n\n![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)\nFigure 1 The timeline shows how Russia adapted cyber means to kinetic operations $^{153}$\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, when Russia employs cyber means of warfare along with kinetic attacks, these means become subject to the LOAC principles. Figure 1 above, depicted by Microsoft, shows how critical infrastructures are subject to cyber operations as the Russian tanks roll toward cities. Additionally, the fact that certain facilities, which are being physically attacked, were subject to cyber operations, demonstrates that the coordination is not general but rather as specific as possible. As a result, every operation that is part of an attack has to be evaluated within the meaning of the LOAC, and this necessitates evaluating the cyber means stated above to be employed by respecting relevant rules, including the principle of precautions.\n\nWhile choosing cyber methods, the first relevant factor is the timing of the attack to minimize collateral damage.[154] During World War II, Allied Forces conducted attacks on military factories at times when there were a minimum number of civilian workers present.[155] In that vein, for example, while carrying out cyber attacks against dual-use objects, the belligerent party may execute them at night or early in the morning when the targets are not intensively used by civilians.\n\n153.

    "The application of the principle of precautions to cyber operations 25\n\nThe second relevant criterion is the location of the target. If a target is located in a place that is mostly used by civilians and there is a significant level of risk of harm occurring, the attacker shall use the most accurate weapons available or must refrain from conducting such an attack.¹⁵⁶ At this point, there is a discussion on whether the Internet can be held as a lawful target because, while it might make an effective contribution to the military capacity of the enemy, it is mostly used by civilians. Even though it is argued that if an attacking party believes that it can get enough military advantage, a cyber attack against the Internet is permissible,¹⁵⁷ another opinion accepts the Internet as a civilian object and prohibits such an attack.¹⁵⁸ According to the latter opinion, even if it is intended to carry out a cyber attack against the Internet, it should be limited to ‘individual networks, servers, routers, links, and other computer facilities that are used for military purposes and which are likely to be connected to the Internet’.¹⁵⁹ By accepting the latter interpretation, the present author considers that if it is possible to considerably limit the effects of the attack, especially by considering the dual nature of cyberspace, then an attack may be conducted. If not, it will be in breach of the rule.\n\nWhilst some authors argue that the choice of means and methods only come onto the scene when there is a similar advantage,¹⁶⁰ the present author thinks that the criteria should not be applied strictly. As stated by Borghard and Lonergan while discussing coercion in cyberspace, the attacking party tries to apply less harmful ways, such as disruptive operations rather than destructive ones, in order to better negotiate at later stages since the system may be restored more easily when the former type of means are used.¹⁶¹ At this point, the belligerent party should choose the type of means or methods to achieve the intended outcomes by considering the post-conflict situation.¹⁶² There is no doubt that a large number of civilian deaths will prolong the conflict, even if the attacks are perfectly legal. The bombing of Radio-Television of Serbia by NATO, which sparked so many debates about the legality of the campaign, may be an example of the adverse impact of such conduct. To Kolb, even if the station can be assumed as a military objective, it was repaired in three hours, and 16 civilians were killed because of the attack.¹⁶³ By taking lessons from this example, it can be stated that belligerent parties should always consider alternatives, even if a designed cyber attack seems lawful. In such a case, disrupting broadcasting by cyber operation might produce better consequences, even though it seems that destruction promises more advantage. In these kinds of situations, perpetrators should always keep the humanitarian aims of the LOAC in mind.\n\n¹⁵⁶.

    "The Military Law and the Law of War Review, Vol. 61 No. 1\n\n## 3.3 The rule of proportionality in precautions\n\nIt is stated in Article 57(2) of the AP-I that:\n\n(a) those who plan or decide upon an attack shall:\n(iii) refrain from deciding to launch any attack which may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated;\n\n(b) an attack shall be cancelled or suspended if it becomes apparent that the objective is not a military one or is subject to special protection or that the attack may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated.\n\nWhile the former provision comes into scene at the planning level, the latter concerns the execution stage. However, both of these provisions have similar meanings by prohibiting attacks conducted against a legitimate target if it seems that ‘excessive’ collateral damage will occur, whether the cyber attack is being planned or has already been planned.¹⁶⁴ At this point, there should be a balance between military advantage and civilian harm.\n\n## 3.3.1 Military advantage\n\nThe advantage should be military in nature rather than merely moral, political or financial.¹⁶⁵ For example, conducting cyber attacks against specific sectors of a country, such as the oil industry, which is vital for Arab countries, by considering that such an operation against ‘war-sustaining objects’ will decrease the military effort of an enemy is not appropriate since ‘almost every civilian activity might be construed by the enemy as indirectly sustaining the war effort’ as stated by Dinstein.¹⁶⁶ Also, it is stated in the Official Commentary that this type of advantage can only be gained by the annihilation of an enemy or gaining ground; the transformation of the notion of war, however, changed this paradigm.¹⁶⁷ While the former can be categorized as an overstatement, the latter seems to be an understatement. Hence, as a moderate approach, the HPCR Manual Commentary points out that ‘any consequence of an attack which directly enhances friendly military operations or hinders those of the enemy’¹⁶⁸ should be included within the ambit of military advantage.\n\nCyber attacks should be assessed as a whole while aiming to obtain military advantage.¹⁶⁹ As stated by Fenrick and approved by declarations of numerous states, proportionality calculations cannot be made on either ‘a bullet-by-bullet basis’ or ‘the basis of attacks on individual military objectives’.¹⁷⁰ Furthermore, when the army launches concerted or coordinated cyber attacks, it may be impossible or impractical for every\n\n¹⁶⁴.

Although it was claimed that people who give an order will bear responsibility rather than those who execute the attack in such a case, if it is apparent that the targeted network is civilian in nature after the attack is initiated, it should be cancelled or a confirmation should be demanded by the perpetrator from higher ranks in light of changing circumstances.¹⁷² Lastly, assessing a cyber attack as a whole should not be interpreted as having a purpose to obtain military advantage by taking the ‘full context of a war strategy’ into account.¹⁷³ Otherwise, all cyber attacks, whether they incur excessive civilian damages or not, can be deemed legal in defiance of the aims of the LOAC.\n\n## 3.3.2 Collateral damage\n\nCollateral damage can be described as an ‘incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians and damage to civilian objects or other protected objects or a combination thereof, caused by an attack on a lawful target’.¹⁷⁴ At this point, collateral damage occurs while conducting cyber attacks against military targets without deliberately targeting civilians and civilian property.\n\nCollateral damage includes both the direct and indirect effects of a cyber attack. While the former type of effects are those that ‘are the immediate, first order consequence of a military action (weapons employment results, etc.), unaltered by intervening events or mechanisms’;¹⁷⁵ the latter type of effects are ‘the delayed or displaced second-, third-, and higher-order consequences of action, created through intermediate events or mechanisms’.¹⁷⁶ Since cyber operations are carried out at the logical layer of cyberspace, their first-order effects have an impact on data, programs, or software; nevertheless, such effects are not included in the aforementioned definition of collateral damage.¹⁷⁷ Yet, ‘indirect effects may be aimed at the other layers of cyberspace, or at creating other higher-order effects in other domains’, and thereby such effects can raise the level of collateral damage.¹⁷⁸ Therefore, the inclusion of indirect effects in the concept of collateral harm is crucial. However, due to the complexity involved in calculating second- or higher-order effects, such an inclusion also poses a significant challenge in cyberspace. As acknowledged in the Allied Doctrine:\n\nSince cyberspace is a global domain, there is a risk of COs [cyberspace operations] having an impact outside the joint operations area.

This risk, as with similar risks in other domains, is factored into the planning.¹⁷⁹\n\nEven though it is not necessary to make certain calculations, effects which are too remote or beyond the scope of reasonable certainty will not cause any responsibility for combatants.¹⁸⁰ Lastly, collateral damage does not contain minor effects such as stress, irritation or inconvenience.¹⁸¹ All cyber attacks might cause stress or inconvenience to some extent, but that does not make them illegal.\n\n## 3.3.3 Excessive collateral damage\n\nBelligerent parties should always consider whether the expected military advantage is proportionate compared to the anticipated collateral damage. At this point, the terms ‘extensive’ and ‘excessive’ should be differentiated. In the Official Commentary, it was argued that conducting attacks against lawful targets should not create ‘extensive destruction of civilian objects’¹⁸² despite the fact that there is no reference to such a limitation in the Additional Protocols. The collateral damage can be justified even if it is at the ‘extensive’ level on the condition that the nominated target is important enough. Although civilian casualties are ‘regrettable and tragic consequences of the war’, those losses do not ‘in themselves establish liability … under international law’ as stated by the Eritrea-Ethiopia Claims Commission.¹⁸³\n\nExcessiveness cannot be determined by approaching it as a mathematical formula, despite the fact that ‘[f]ifty civilians killed for one suspected combatant’ is given as a ‘textbook example of a violation of the proportionality principle’ by some authors.¹⁸⁴ However, as stated in the NATO Bombing Report:\n\nIt is much easier to formulate the principle of proportionality in general terms than it is to apply it to a particular set of circumstances because the comparison is often between unlike quantities and values. One cannot easily assess the value of innocent human lives as opposed to capturing a particular military objective.¹⁸⁵\n\nHence, excessiveness should be evaluated depending upon the comparison between two values, namely, collateral damage and military advantage. Although it is hard to estimate excessiveness in cyberspace and to prevent it, there are methods to make a reasonable assessment. It is stated in the Allied Doctrine that:\n\nCOs [cyberspace operations] will be conducted according to the operation plan. As such, SCEPVA [Sovereign Cyber Effects Provided Voluntarily by Allies], when authorised, might give the commander alternative options to create effects. These options are integrated,\n\n¹⁷⁹.

At this point, the determination of the effects and excessiveness of an action will be based on the good faith of the combatant, its reasonableness and the circumstances in which the cyber attack is planned and executed.\n\n## 3.4 Effective warning\n\nIt is stated in Article 57(2)(c) of the AP-I that ‘effective advance warning shall be given of attacks which may affect the civilian population, unless circumstances do not permit’. The first appearance of this rule can be traced back to the Lieber Code, in which it was stated that:\n\nCommanders, whenever admissible, inform the enemy of their intention to bombard a place, so that the noncombatants, and especially the women and children, may be removed before the bombardment commences. But it is no infraction of the common law of war to omit thus to inform the enemy. Surprise may be a necessity.¹⁸⁷\n\nAs it can be observed from the article, if a party plans to conduct a surprise cyber attack, it does not need to give any warning so as not to endanger the success of the operation.¹⁸⁸ Surprise may be necessary in some cases, such as when there is a risk of a pre-emptive cyber attack or the exposure of a broader campaign.¹⁸⁹ The Tallinn Manual illustrates this by saying that:\n\nConsider, for example, a cyber operation involving placement of a kill-switch into the target computer’s control system, to be activated on the occurrence of some future event or after the passage of a specified period. A warning that would give the enemy an opportunity to locate and neutralise the device need not be given.¹⁹⁰\n\nTherefore, giving warning is limited to appropriate circumstances since an attacker may have special reasons that justify not giving any warning.¹⁹¹ A relevant consideration could be the equation comparing the level of military advantage between situations in which giving occurs and those in which it does not. If the gap justifies civilian harm, then the attacking party does not need to give a warning in advance.\n\nIf it is expected that the cyber attack will exclusively affect civilian objects and not have any impact on civilians, then giving warning will not be necessary.¹⁹² By approving this point, the Australian Military Manual states that the warning can be directed at civilians, who bear the dangers posed by an intended attack, or at responsible authorities.¹⁹³ In that vein, if harm to civilians is expected, then they can be warned in many ways through\n\n¹⁸⁶.

Even though the Australian Military Manual suggests adopting ‘commonsense’ to achieve effectiveness, this does not clarify the notion but adds extra blurriness to it.¹⁹⁷ On the other hand, the term ‘effective’ is defined in the dictionary as ‘producing a decided, decisive, or desired effect’.¹⁹⁸ Based on this definition, it can at least be said that in order for a warning to be effective, it should aim to reduce collateral damage to a minimum. To accomplish this, the content of the warning should be reasonably clear and specific so that civilians have a chance to secure themselves from the effects of an attack.¹⁹⁹ Both of these terms should be determined based on the context. In terms of clarity, rather than giving technical details, belligerent parties may underline the effects of cyber attacks and provide guidelines to civilians on how to protect themselves from such effects. In terms of specificity, there is no requirement to give a specific warning for every situation; the warning may be general in a way that provides a list of cyber objectives that might be targeted.²⁰⁰ Overall, there is no one correct method to issuing effective warnings, but they should be tailored to diverse scenarios to protect civilians.\n\nWarnings can be conducted through an enemy if it makes the warning more effective.²⁰¹ However, such a warning can also be used as a ruse of war. For example, ‘a false announcement of a cyber attack affecting dual-use systems might prove militarily useful in causing the enemy to take its military assets off-line’.²⁰² Nevertheless, if it is expected that such a warning causes civilians to ignore future real warnings and to put them in danger, then this will be prohibited.²⁰³ Further, the belligerent party should not give a warning in order to spread terror among civilians.²⁰⁴ As stated in Article 51(2) of the AP-I, ‘[a]cts or threats of violence the primary purpose of which is to spread terror among the civilian population are prohibited’. For this reason, warnings given through cyberspace that aim to ‘frighten or cause panic among residents or compel them to leave their homes for reasons other than their safety’ are forbidden.²⁰⁵ Although there is always a danger for civilians to be exposed to fake news via the Internet without the knowledge of the attacking party, it is also their obligation to search for the truth.\n\n194.

    "The application of the principle of precautions to cyber operations 31\n\n# 3.5 The least danger rule\n\nIt is stated in Article 57(3) of the AP-I that:\n\nWhen a choice is possible between several military objectives for obtaining a similar military advantage, the objective to be selected shall be that the attack on which may be expected to cause the least danger to civilian lives and to civilian objects.\n\nFrom the perspective of this article, if a commander has more than one option, then the rule can be applicable. Therefore, this rule is also known as ‘the lesser of two evils’.²⁰⁶ The rationale behind the article is simple: While a commander is trying to get the maximum effect on the military capacity of the enemy, he/she should seek an option which has minimum effect on civilians. The example given in the Official Commentary is that ‘[i]nstead of attacking railway stations, which are usually located in towns, the railway lines were hit at crucial points, but away from inhabited areas; the same action was taken with respect to roads’.²⁰⁷ By analogy, it can be stated that cyber attacks should be conducted against specific networks of electricity distribution facilities rather than the whole power station.²⁰⁸ However, the rule comes into scene when two different options promise military advantage at the same level.²⁰⁹ Otherwise, the attack is subject to other provisions and principles, i.e., proportionality.\n\nThere are two critical discussions to have while inflicting the least amount of harm on civilians and civilian property. First, whether or not causing harm to civilians and civilian property is equally important. At this point, while discussing the Kosovo Conflict, General Clark states that ‘[w]e weren’t going to disregard risks to civilians but the alternative to taking risks with property damage was that we might ultimately have to put our troops in on the ground’.²¹⁰ From this example, it seems that objects have less value than civilian lives in practice. However, cyber operations are more likely to have effects on objects than on people. Therefore, the relevant discussion may be whether all objects have the same value in cyberspace. At this point, Henderson offers to determine the value of objects by various factors such as ‘the “utility” of the object, the objects “replace-ability”, and the cost of replacement’.²¹¹ In that vein, in terms of utility, it may be preferable to have an impact on financial records rather than medical data in cyberspace. The second discussion is whether belligerent parties put civilians at greater risk than their own troops. Although some states and scholars adopt the opinion that the security of armed forces should be included in military advantage,²¹² another approach holds that the armed forces must accept the risks posed by combat actions, and those risks should not be borne by civilians.²¹³ The present author considers that an attacking party who conducts cyber attacks against an enemy already minimizes the dangers of combat for its own troops because of their remoteness\n\n²⁰⁶.

Therefore, it should not disregard civilian damage by claiming force protection.\n\nBeyond mere humanitarianism, it is a military reality to target legitimate objectives to the maximum extent while harming civilians to the minimum. Carnahan states that '[t]he wise military officer will try to concentrate firepower on key military objectives and to keep to a minimum the collateral damage not only for humanitarian reasons, but also because munitions that injure civilians are wasted munitions'.[214] When the humanitarian impacts of such 'wasted munitions' are considered along with their military value, it is a well-known fact that when civilian harm increases, the likelihood of success of the mission decreases, so belligerent parties should aim to put the least amount of risk on civilians if there is an opportunity to refrain from it while gaining a military advantage at the same level, or at least another option that significantly decreases the military advantage.[215]\n\n# 4 PRECAUTIONS AGAINST THE EFFECTS OF CYBER OPERATIONS\n\n## 4.1 General remarks\n\nIt is stated in Article 58 of the AP-I that:\n\nThe Parties to the conflict shall, to the maximum extent feasible:\n\n(a) without prejudice to Article 49 of the Fourth Convention, endeavour to remove the civilian population, individual civilians and civilian objects under their control from the vicinity of military objectives;\n\n(b) avoid locating military objectives within or near densely populated areas;\n\n(c) take the other necessary precautions to protect the civilian population, individual civilians and civilian objects under their control against the dangers resulting from military operations.\n\nThe rationale behind the article is to abstain from 'defensive tactics that unnecessarily increases civilian risk' by endangering civilians and civilian objects to the detrimental effects of military operations.[216] For this reason, belligerent parties should segregate their military objectives from civilians and civilian objectives; if this is not possible, they should at least protect these people and objects from the effects of cyber operations.[217]\n\nThe rule is applicable within the territory of the belligerent party, which is responsible for the protection of its nationals or people under its control.[218] However, this territorial application of the rule may pose a significant hurdle in cyberspace. Although it was claimed that 'all civilian cyber infrastructure and activities located in territory under the control of a party to the conflict are subject to this Rule', this approach cannot be applicable in cyberspace since it is almost impossible to control every civilian activity in this domain.[219] This follows a risk that a responsible government may claim\n\n214.

    "The application of the principle of precautions to cyber operations 33\n\nthat ‘it does not have authority over most of the cyber infrastructure due to the various legal regimes that exist within the nation’.²²⁰ At this point, the term ‘control’ refutes such a defence by obligating the party to protect civilians and civilian property by segregating civilian computer systems if it has a capacity to control these systems.²²¹ As a result, this obligation should not be applied by taking territorial concerns into account but rather by considering whether or not these systems are under the de facto control of a party.\n\nThese precautions are applicable as soon as they are ‘to the maximum extent feasible’. Although the term ‘feasible’ was explained in the first chapter, the Official Commentary further clarifies this term by noting that those measures should ‘not go beyond the point where the life of the population would become difficult or even impossible’.²²² Also, the Tallinn Manual explains the term ‘maximum extent’ in a way that it ‘emphasises the importance of taking the requisite measures’.²²³ According to one approach, those measures can be applied depending upon ‘the requirements of national defence’ as stated in the declaration of Austria.²²⁴ From this perspective, parties do not need to expose all of their military facilities, or to put them in a more dangerous position by considering the dictations of the national defence.²²⁵ This is explained in Official Records by the delegation of the Republic of Korea with the following words:\n\n[T]his provision does not constitute a restriction on a State’s military installations on its own territory. We consider that military facilities necessary for a country’s national defence should be decided on the basis of the actual needs and other considerations of that particular country. An attempt to regulate a country’s requirements and the fulfilment of those requirements in this connexion would not conform to actualities.²²⁶\n\nThis is a valid argument since, as described in the first chapter, the principle of precautions obligates parties to take measures when they are ‘practicable or practically possible’. For this reason, every country has to take precautions against the effects of cyber attacks within its own limits.\n\nWhile the term ‘constant care’ is not explicitly stated in the article, it is still a valid consideration which should be taken into account in order to alleviate risks to civilians and civilian property.²²⁷ At this point, Corn points three reasons why constant care should be taken in both active and passive precautions:²²⁸ First, there is no clear line between ‘attacking’ and ‘defending’ parties in terms of operational art since every armed force needs to conduct both types of operations in the conflict. Second, ‘constant care’ obliges all parties of an armed conflict to conduct their operations by taking civilian harm into account as well as seeking to gain military advantage. This obligation cannot be confined to the attacking party. Third, the exclusion of defending\n\n220. Jensen (fn 58) 214–15.\n221. Ibid.\n222.

When the nature of cyberspace is taken into account, the obligation becomes more important than conventional warfare since the domain has many more complexities than other areas.\n\nThese measures are similarly sampled in the ICRC Challenge Report and the Tallinn Manual while discussing feasible precautions against the effects of cyber attacks:\n\n[S]egregating military from civilian cyber infrastructure; segregating computer systems on which critical civilian infrastructure depends from the Internet; backing up important civilian data; making advance arrangements to ensure the timely repair of important computer systems; digitally recording important cultural or spiritual objects to facilitate reconstruction in the event of their destruction; and using anti-virus measures to protect civilian systems that might suffer damage or destruction during an attack on military cyber infrastructure.²²⁹\n\nThis is not an exhaustive list, and every situation may require different precautions to be taken.\n\n## 4.2 The segregation of civilian networks\n\nAs it is indicated above, Article 58(a) of the AP-I requires parties to ‘endeavour to remove the civilian population, individual civilians and civilian objects under their control from the vicinity of military objectives’. The obligation should be applied when there is an immediate danger to civilians, and they should be evacuated them from the territory ‘where the risk of attack is greatest’.²³⁰ Even if this measure brings some difficulty to civilians, it aims to protect them from greater suffering, and alternative accommodations should be provided.²³¹ If these measures are not achieved, this can be deemed forced displacement and a violation of international law.\n\nWhilst the rule seems applicable when traditional battlefield is taken into account, it still creates some problems. For example, the rule was opposed by Switzerland because of its geographical conditions, where most civilians live in valleys in which important military facilities are located due to the limited number of useful locations in the country, so it becomes very hard to segregate civilians and civilian objects from the proximity of these facilities.²³² The same hardship is applicable for some facilities that can be important for both civilians and military personnel, such as air traffic control centres and power generation plants.²³³\n\nOn the other hand, the application of the rule in cyberspace brings more difficulty than in traditional domains. Civilian infrastructures are used for almost all cyber operations, and most of them have a dual nature.²³⁴ As an example, how can civilians be removed from cloud technology, which is also used for military purposes?²³⁵ Nevertheless, it is argued in a legal assessment published by the US Department of Defence that ‘[w]here there is a choice … military systems should be kept separate from\n\n²²⁹.

The United States military uses multiple, dedicated networks to conduct administrative, logistical and operational activities. The three best-known networks are the Non-Classified Internet Protocol Router Network (NIPRnet, which carries information classified up to and including Sensitive but Unclassified), Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRnet, which carries data classified up to and including the Secret level) and the Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communication System (JWICS carries data classified up to and including Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information).²³⁹\n\nAs this example clearly shows, it is imperative to segregate the different types of networks, even if it can be costly.²⁴⁰ Otherwise, if the object makes an effective contribution and the segregation cannot be established, then the whole cyber infrastructure would be a lawful target.²⁴¹\n\nGovernmental and civilian data can be stored in the public cloud, despite the fact that this does not literally satisfy the criteria for segregation. However, the Russia-Ukraine War proved its usefulness in terms of reducing cyber dangers. The Ukrainian government moved an important part of the state’s digital infrastructure to the public cloud in preparation for Russian cyber operations against its governmental data center.²⁴² In this sense, cloud technology turns the disadvantage of cyber infrastructure’s interconnectedness into an advantage. As a more advanced example, the Estonian government established a ‘data embassy’ whose ‘resources are under Estonian state control, secured against cyberattacks or crisis situations with KSI [Keyless Signature Infrastructure] Blockchain technology, and are capable not only providing data backups, but also operating the most critical services’.²⁴³ The particular advantage of such precautions compared with network segregation is that they protect civilian data not only from cyber attacks but also from other types of crises that might occur within states’ borders, such as natural disasters or kinetic attacks.²⁴⁴\n\nIf such precautions impose a significant burden on the belligerent and are not feasible solutions, belligerent parties should search for other ways to shield civilian\n\n236.

From this perspective, parties to the conflict should refrain from locating both movable and immovable objects close to densely populated areas in order to protect civilians under their control.²⁴⁷ Nevertheless, the rule should not be limited to densely populated areas but also include ‘hospitals, cultural property, places of worship, prisoner of war camps, and other facilities which are entitled to specific protection’²⁴⁸ by refraining from locating cyber military objectives in or around them.\n\nWhile the applicability of the rule is understood in a physical sense, and social media or other similar civilian websites ‘cannot be equated with densely populated areas’, the rule obliges parties to take measures by considering cyber infrastructures which are physically located in the territory of a party.²⁴⁹ Therefore, for instance, army cyber commands should not be located in places where civilians or special protected objects can be put in danger. However, there is a significant hurdle to locating defence ministries in a place which is not close to densely populated areas. On the other hand, it is still possible for parties to exclude these kinds of facilities, which are military in nature but almost impossible to locate in isolated places, from the ambit of the attack through negotiation. Even if they cannot be attacked, it is possible for a party to conduct disruptive cyber operations against cyber infrastructures in these facilities. At this point, cyber operations give a unique opportunity to parties not to harm civilians but to still have an impact on the military capacity of their enemies.\n\n## 4.4 Other passive measures\n\nAs it is stated above, belligerent parties should ‘take the other necessary precautions to protect the civilian population, individual civilians and civilian objects under their control against the dangers resulting from military operations’ according to Article 58(c) of the AP-I. While there is no limit on the scope of the rule, the Official Commentary states that this rule should be applied to civilians by providing them with protective shelters, as well as to specially protected objects by providing trained personnel to limit damage to them.²⁵⁰ However, conflicting parties should take all feasible precautions by taking the gap-filling function of Article 58(c) into account.\n\n²⁴⁵.

    "The application of the principle of precautions to cyber operations 37\n\nIt has been claimed that while providing shelter may seem rational in traditional domains, its application in cyberspace is still unknown.²⁵¹ However, there are some measures which are applicable to cyberspace by analogy. For example, civilians might be supported by providing them with software products such as anti-virus programs that limit the damage from cyber attacks, detecting civilian cyber systems in order to warn people in case of intrusion attempts, providing them technical assistance when their computer systems are harmed, providing a back-up system to store civilian data, blocking particular IP addresses which pose risks to civilian systems, and keeping ready a system that makes it possible to disconnect an entire country from the Internet when all measures are exhausted.²⁵²\n\nWhile the title of Article 58 includes ‘attacks’, paragraph (c) clearly states that some precautions should be applied to operations. Although Jensen admits the ambiguity of this situation, he argues that countries which are not parties to the AP-I have responsibility arising from this provision for those acts that reach ‘attack’ threshold.²⁵³ In the Tallinn Manual, even though the majority of experts stated that the rule is applicable only to cyber attacks because of the title of the article and the non-existence of customary law, the minority focused on the wording of paragraph (c) by accepting cyber operations within the ambit of this rule.²⁵⁴ Therefore, the minority view kept the threshold lower, determined disruptive operations to be covered by this rule, and obligated parties to take precautions against the effects of these operations.²⁵⁵ However, both parties have a common understanding on the non-application of the rule to ‘mere inconvenience or irritation’.²⁵⁶\n\nThere is no clear-cut answer on which precautions should be taken within the ambit of Article 58(c), since the provision serves as a gap-filler in the article. Despite the fact that it did not receive much attention in the past because the suitability of other provisions for kinetic activities made them more visible than paragraph (c), their relative unsuitability for cyber operations rendered this clause more important. At this point, the implementation of the norm in cyberspace has already begun to be shaped by the practices of both state and non-state actors, and this trend seems to be continuing and getting better. For example, the US government has begun to warn private entities when they are subjected to transborder cyber attacks and has provided them with cyber tools and training to combat those attacks.²⁵⁷ Furthermore, the Security Service of Ukraine informs civilians about cyber threats and what measures to take in order to avoid them.²⁵⁸ As a recent innovative example, the ICRC has been conducting research on creating a ‘digital emblem’ for the past two years in order to enable the identification of objects, systems, or networks that cannot be subject to cyber attacks.²⁵⁹ Lastly, even though these are individual precautionary measures, the Russia-Ukraine War has also demonstrated how state and non-state entities can collaborate to\n\n251.

The Microsoft Report highlights two examples of cyber security measures against Russian cyber activities:\n\nThe first has been the use of technology acquired from RiskIQ that identifies and maps organizational attack surfaces, including devices that are unpatched against known vulnerabilities and therefore are the most susceptible to attack. This information has been shared with the Ukrainian government free of charge to enable it to accelerate the strengthening of cyber-defenses. Ukrainian network defenders worked tirelessly with the constant support of the CERT UA within the government to use this information to protect computers across the country.\n\nThe second measure has been a wartime innovation pursued with the collaboration and support of the Ukrainian government. MSTIC recognized that Russian malware could be mitigated meaningfully by turning on a feature in Microsoft Defender called controlled folder access. This typically would require that IT administrators access devices across their organization, work made more difficult and potentially even dangerous in wartime conditions. The Ukrainian government therefore authorized Microsoft through special legal measures to act proactively and remotely to turn on this feature across devices throughout the government and across the country.²⁶⁰\n\nEvery effort having a purpose to minimize collateral damage is desired in cyberspace; the principle of precaution essentially relies on the processes but not the results.\n\n# 5 CONCLUSION\n\nNew technologies have changed the nature of armed conflict significantly, and this process increasingly continues. As one kind of these technologies, cyber operations have introduced significant challenges to the LOAC, but the most unique one is their capability to have a wide range of effects because of the interconnectedness of cyberspace. This article has endeavoured to determine the application of the principle of precautions to cyber operations by tilting the principle towards humanity by considering the natures of both the principle and cyberspace.\n\nFrom the standpoint of the principle of precautions, the Russia-Ukraine War exemplified an important phenomenon: public-private cooperation against adversarial cyber operations. Unlike traditional domains, private entities have a partial but critical level of control over cyberspace, and as a result of this distinctive feature of the current conflicts, the Ukrainian government collaborated with a technology giant, Microsoft.²⁶¹ This collaboration is emphasized in the Microsoft Report by stating that:\n\n[U]nlike the traditional threats of the past, cyber defenses rely on a unique level of public and private collaboration. The evolving threat landscape requires a whole-of-society approach. The private sector, particularly technology companies, are on the front lines of cyber and information attacks. Likewise, civil society organizations are key conveners that play a crucial role in engagement, sometimes are involved in cyber data analysis, and are often targets of these campaigns themselves.²⁶²\n\nBringing non-public entities into the equation in cyberspace, thereby putting more civilians in the balance, would enhance the ‘civilianization’ of armed conflicts, and this would inherently lean the principle of precaution on the side of humanity.\n\n²⁶⁰.
