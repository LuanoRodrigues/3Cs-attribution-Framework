(EUI), Associate Professor, Inland Norway University of Applied Science (Lillehammer) and Associate Professor II, University of Oslo\njohann.leiss@inn.no\n## Abstract\nThis article explores the (in)activity of many States in contributing to the interpretative clarification of 'how' jus contra bellum applies in cyberspace, its negative repercussions for the work of the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing responsible State behaviour in cyberspace in the context of international security (UN GGE) and the United Nations Open-Ended Working Group on Developments in the Field of ICTs in the Context of International Security (UN OEWG), and the way forward. In its main part, the article analyses the (legal) consequences of interpretative silence and challenges its (presumably) underlying rationale – that is, a strategy of legal ambiguity based on the traditional 'freedom of State' paradigm. This article argues that it is only by actively contributing to the clarification of the law that States ensure their voice is heard and avoid the risk that their silence is interpreted as acquiescence. Moreover, contrary to what the freedom of State paradigm implies, the subjective interpretation of the parties is not the only 'game in town'. If no interpretative agreement of States crystallises, the interpretation of jus contra bellum is determined by objective factors. The article concludes by arguing that from a rule of law perspective, States should be encouraged to express their views on 'how' jus contra bellum applies in cyberspace to ensure the efficiency and transparency of these rules, which constitute part of the backbone of a peaceful co-existence and cooperation between states.\n## Keywords\njus contra bellum, cyberwarfare, treaty interpretation, acquiescence, UN GGE, UN OEWG\n## 1. Introduction\nAmong the great challenges to international law posed by the digitisation of our modern world is the fact that modern warfare has expanded into cyberspace.¹ As with any technical developments in human history, warfare has taken up new digital technologies.² Modern armies have the capability to cause death and destruction via cyberspace. At the same time, societies have become increasingly vulnerable.³ Much critical infrastructure is digitalised,\n1.

These rules apply to cyberspace.¹¹ This is confirmed by numerous statements of States and by the outputs of the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing responsible State behaviour in cyberspace in the context of international security (‘UN GGE’)¹² and the United Nations Open-Ended Working Group on Developments in the Field of ICTs in the Context of International Security (‘UN OEWG’).¹³ The 2013 consensus report of the third UN GGE noted in general terms that international law and, in particular, the UN Charter applies in cyberspace.¹⁴ The following 2015 and 2021 reports of the fourth and sixth UN GGEs made clear that the UN Charter ‘applies in its entirety’.¹⁵\nHowever, there is still much uncertainty on exactly ‘how’ these rules apply.¹⁶ To give just\n4.

Today, *jus ad bellum* is increasingly referred to as *jus contra bellum*, cf Olivier Corten, *The Law Against War: The Prohibition on the Use of Force in Contemporary International Law* (Hart 2012) passim; Delerue (n 1) 275. Note that this article is concerned with *jus contra bellum* issues but not *jus in bello* issues, the latter referring to the question of how the laws of war would govern the use of cyber-attacks during an ongoing armed conflict.\n10. Charter of the United Nations (opened for signature 26 June 1945, entered into force 24 October 1945) 3 Bevans 1153. The *jus contra bellum* also includes Chapter 7, Article 42 UN Charter, which deals with UN Security Council authorization.\n11. Cf Delerue (n 1) 1–2.\n12. The UN GGE was established in 2002 by the UN Secretary-General at the request of the UN General Assembly, cf A/Res/56/19 (2002). Since 2004, six working groups have been convened, with the last one in 2019, cf 2004/2005 A/RES/58/32 (2003); 2009/2010 A/RES/60/45 (2006); 2012/2013 A/RES/66/24 (2011); 2014/2015 A/RES/68/243 (2014); 2016/2017 A/RES/70/237 (2015); 2019/2021 A/RES/73/266 (2019). The UN GGE reports to the UN General Assembly. The UN General Assembly considered and endorsed – by consensus – the 2010, 2013 and 2015 UN GGE reports, cf A/RES/65/41 (2011); A/RES/68/243 (2014); A/RES/70/237 (2015). Up until recently, the UN GGE was the primary inter-state forum for discussions on the legal regulation of cyberspace, cf Anders Henriksen, ‘The End of the Road for the UN GGE Process: The Future Regulation of Cyberspace’ (2019) 5 (1) *Journal of Cybersecurity*, 1; Martha Finnemore and Kathryn Sikkink, ‘International Norm Dynamics and Political Change’ (1998) 52 *International Organ* 887.

The UN OEWG was established in 2018 as a second UN forum for the discussion of the regulation of cyberspace, A/RES/73/27 (2018).

What kind of activities constitute an ‘armed attack’ and might give a State cause to invoke its inherent right to self-defence (Article 51 UN Charter)?¹⁷ Where along the spectrum of permissible to impermissible conduct do various types of cyber-attacks lie? How is mere cyber-criminality to be distinguished from warfare? Should we apply the so-called ‘scale and effects’ test according to which a cyberoperation constitutes a ‘use of force’ if its scale and effects are comparable to the scale and effects of a ‘traditional’ use of kinetic force? How can we attribute use of force in cyberspace?¹⁸ More generally, how do we apply rules that are based on the existence of geographical borders, over which States exercise sovereignty, to cyberspace, in which such borders are far from distinct?¹⁹\nConsidering these open questions, it is all the more remarkable that many States shy away from actively contributing to the interpretative clarification of the law. They do not publish interpretative statements and do not make their practice of cyberwarfare public.\nPart 2 discusses the (in)activity of States to contribute to the interpretative clarification of ‘how’ jus contra bellum applies in cyberspace and discusses its negative repercussions for the work of the UN GGE and UN OEWG. Part 3 discusses possible explanations for the (legal) politics behind this interpretative silence. It argues that silence can be explained by a strategy of legal ambiguity, which finds its legal rationale in the traditional ‘freedom of State’ paradigm. The aim of this strategy is to keep the jus contra bellum in limbo and open scope for manoeuvre to cope with new technical developments and remaining strategic uncertainties in cyberwarfare.\nPart 4 discusses the (legal) consequences of interpretative silence and challenges its underlying rationale. The argument is that under the discursive framework provided by Articles 31–33 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (‘VCLT’)²⁰, the interpretation – or non-interpretation – of the parties to a treaty remains a central factor to be taken into account. However, it is only by actively contributing to the clarification of the law that States ensure their voice is heard and avoid the risk that their silence is interpreted as acquiescence. Moreover, contrary to what the freedom of State paradigm implies, the subjective interpretation of the parties is not the only ‘game in town’. Articles 31–32 VCLT and other factors complement the subjective dimension of interpretation with an objective one. The less the ‘authentic’ interpretation of the parties leads to interpretative clarification, the more the other modes of interpretation come to the fore. As such, legal ambiguity is a misnomer for the lack of centralised interpretative authority in international law. Part 5 concludes.\n---\n¹⁷ Cf Initial ‘pre-draft’ of the report of the UN OEWG <https: 03=\"\" 200311-pre-draft-oewg-ict.pdf=\"\" 2020=\"\" unoda-web.s3.amazonaws.com=\"\" wp-content=\"\" uploads=\"\" wp=\"\"> (‘UN OEWG pre-draft’) [27].

Interpretative silence and jus contra bellum in cyberspace\n### 2.1 Jus contra bellum in cyberspace – a question of UN Charter interpretation\nThe present article presumes that questions concerning the application of *jus contra bellum* to cyberspace are first and foremost a matter of UN Charter interpretation. In the author’s view, the UN Charter-based *jus contra bellum* norms and their customary corollaries have merged into a single norm,²¹ even though the customary manifestation is based in a different source, and insofar remains conceptually independent from its treaty corollary.²² Article 103 UN Charter, which attaches supremacy to UN Charter law over other international law, also applies to customary international law.²³ As such, customary derogation from the UN Charter based *jus contra bellum* is excluded.\nUnder what conditions an interpretation of UN Charter law amounts to a modification of the rules in question must not be conclusively discussed here. While further development of the Charter by consensual re-interpretation and customary application is possible,²⁴ for the present purpose it is sufficient to keep in mind that it is not easily to be presumed that States want to circumvent the strict requirements for Charter amendments (Articles 108 and 109 UN Charter).²⁵ There are, however, notable examples of informal UN Charter modification.²⁶\n### 2.2 Widespread interpretative silence\nConsidering the overall picture, we see that many States remain reluctant to clearly position themselves and contribute to a clarification of ‘how’ *jus contra bellum* applies in cyberspace.²⁷ An increasing number of States have published ‘cyber security strategies’,²⁸ and a growing number of States have also begun to publish statements on international law in cyberspace.²⁹\n---\n21.

The second group of experts (again 15 members)⁴¹ eventually managed to reach an agreement on a short 2010 consensus report.⁴² However, this report only contained a few rudimentary findings and recommendations. It acknowledged the problem of attribution of cyberoperations and risk of potential threats, the ‘absence of a common understanding regarding acceptable State behaviour’, and more generally, the ‘lack of shared understanding regarding international norms pertaining to State use of ICTs’.⁴³ Furthermore, it noted that ‘[e]xisting agreements include norms relevant to the use of ICTs by States’, that ‘additional norms could be developed over time’, and that the dialogue should continue.⁴⁴\nIn 2011, a third group of experts (again 15 members) was set up.⁴⁵ This time the mandate of the group specifically asked not only for a discussion of ‘international concepts aimed at\n37.

As such, the report did not add much to the clarification of ‘how’ jus contra bellum applies in cyberspace.⁵⁶\nIn 2015, a fifth group of experts was established, again with an increased number of members (now 25).⁵⁷ This time, however, the discussions proved even more difficult than in the previous rounds. In June 2017, the experts failed to agree on a draft for a consensus report.⁵⁸ As previously mentioned, one explanation is that Cuba, China and Russia opposed the inclusion of references to the application of the right to self-defence (and the general international law principles of countermeasures and international humanitarian law).⁵⁹\n46. ibid.\n47.

The report reaffirmed that international law, in particular the UN Charter ‘in its entirety’, applies in cyberspace (explicitly including the prohibition on the use of force) and noted again ‘the inherent right of States to take measures consistent with international law and as recognized in the Charter’.⁶²\nWhether the UN OEWG, as a more inclusive platform, will be more successful in clarifying the law remains to be seen. So far, the outcomes of the UN OEWG process have been rather limited. They do not go beyond the findings of the UN GGE.⁶³ In its initial pre-draft from April 2020⁶⁴ and in its final substantive report from 10 March 2021,⁶⁵ the UN OEWG noted that States reaffirmed the application of international law, and in particular UN Charter law, to cyberspace.\nIt would go too far to claim that the unwillingness of some States to publish their interpretations and to stay silent is the only reason for the failure of the UN GGE and the UN OEWG to provide more interpretative clarity. Interpretative activity may also lead to disagreement. However, interpretative engagement could have at least paved the way for finding common ground. This is also supported by the recommendations of the UN OEWG pre-draft and final reports, which emphasise the need for further information on the views and practice of States in relation to ‘how’ international law applies in cyberspace.⁶⁶\n# 3. The (legal) politics of silence\nHow can we explain the reluctance of States to refrain from submitting their legal positions on the interpretation of the jus contra bellum in cyberspace and the preference of some to foster new law-making instead of clarifying existing law? As States rarely explain the reasons for their silence, we can only speculate on their motives. A convincing explanation is that their choice for inactivity is driven by a preference for legal ambiguity, which finds its legal rationale in the traditional ‘freedom of State’ paradigm.\nThe discussion on the regulation of cyberwarfare is not only about the correct interpretation of the law but it ‘is as much about strategy, politics and ideological differences’.⁶⁷ The interpretative approaches chosen by States often reflect their broader strategical interests, which coincide with their economic, military and technical capacities.⁶⁸ Historically this has always been the case; the new reality of cyberwarfare has not changed this. How States interpret jus contra bellum in cyberspace is not independent of their respective ICT strengths and\n⁶⁰. A/RES/73/266 (2019).\n⁶¹. A/76/135 (2021).\n⁶². ibid [69] and [71(d)].\n⁶³.

One possible explanation is that States wait for further technical developments before they formulate their own interpretative approaches. The speed and unpredictability of the development of new digital technologies create enormous strategic uncertainties.⁷¹ While economical resources and technical capacities are also of great importance in the context of cyberwarfare, the open structure of cyberspace seems to have re-shuffled many of the old certainties. Small States with a limited budget and little conventional military power can conduct military measures which have a large-scale effect in almost every corner of the world. Despite their strong conventional military powers, traditional strong military and economic powers feel increasingly vulnerable due to their strong digital connectedness. Against the background of these strategic uncertainties, it seems to be – at least at first glance – a rational choice for States to aim at paralysing legal clarification and perpetuating legal uncertainty, as they cannot sufficiently predict the long-term consequences of their own legal interpretation.⁷²\nFrom a legal-theoretical perspective, this choice of strategic ambiguity can only be explained by the traditional so-called ‘freedom of State’ paradigm. This state-oriented and subjective perspective paradigm considers the freedom and the will of States paramount. It found its most famous manifestation in the Lotus dictum of the Permanent Court of International Justice in 1927. The court held that\ninternational law governs relations between independent States. The rules of law binding upon States therefore emanate from their own free will as expressed in conventions or by usage generally accepted as expressing principles of law and established in order to regulate the relations between these co-existing independent communities or with a view to the achievement of common aims. Restrictions on the independence of States cannot therefore presumed.⁷³\nFrom this perspective, States are only bound by the extent to which they have consented to the rule of international law. Not only the formation of rules, but also their interpretation, follows this paradigm. In an earlier judgment, the PCIJ stated in relation to the interpretation of international law that ‘it is an established principle that the right of giving an authoritative interpretation of a legal rule belongs solely to the person or body who has power to modify or suppress it’.⁷⁴ From this point of view, the freedom of State remains the residual rule. Indeterminacy plays into the hand of States.

If States remain silent, they remain free to do what they want.75\nAlternative explanations for interpretative silence do not convince. Disinterest in the topic seems a rather unlikely explanation, given the great relevance of cyber security in contemporary politics. Disagreement among different branches of the government is another possible explanation.76 However, this author is not aware of any such conflicts between different branches of the government within silent States. Coercion of less powerful States to remain silent due to certain power structures and dependencies in international politics (eg of military or economic nature) may also explain their silence. However, the author is not aware of any concrete cases. A final explanation could be that some States have voiced scepticism against the UN GGE. For example, Russia has referred to the UN GGE as ‘a narrow’ and ‘elitist’ expert platform and criticised the report of the UN OEWG for its linkage to the findings of the UN GGE.77 However, this attitude does not explain a general reluctance of States to position themselves outside of the UN GGE context, for example in the more inclusive forum of the UN OEWG.\n## 4. The (legal) consequence of interpretative silence\n## 4.1 States’ interpretation as ‘subsequent practice’\nTo start with the obvious: no State alone can determine the law with a binding effect for itself or for others by positively interpreting it or by not interpreting it. As Weiler and Haltern have argued, ‘autointerpretation, by each state individually, is mostly accepted as a practical inevitability with little, if any, normative value’.78 While States are usually the first and often also the last interpreters of the law (in the absence of delegation of interpretative authority, for example to an international court), it is wrong to claim that ‘each State establishes for itself its legal situation vis-à-vis other States’.79 To state otherwise would go against one of the cornerstones of the international legal order: the equality of States.80 Just as a single State\n75.

Does it matter that some States publish statements on the interpretation of the *jus contra bellum* in cyberspace whereas others refrain from doing so? Does the strategic inactivity leave the law in limbo?\n81.

As a general rule, an ‘agreement’ in the sense of Article 31(3)(a) or (b) must be ‘established’ and therefore it must be positively identifiable.⁹¹ A ‘subsequent agreement’ (lit a) must be clearly manifested (though not necessarily in written form) and *ipso facto* constitutes an ‘authentic interpretation’.⁹² For ‘subsequent practice’ (lit b), it must be shown that the understanding is common to the parties of the treaties by evincing a ‘particular conduct or circumstances’ through which an agreement can be identified indirectly.⁹³ Therefore, ‘a subsequent agreement’ is typically easier to prove than a ‘subsequent practice’.⁹⁴\nA strict threshold of how many States must actively engage in a subsequent practice under lit b is difficult to establish.⁹⁵ As a general rule, the value of the subsequent practice ‘depends on the extent to which it is concordant, common and consistent’.⁹⁶ Here we can draw a parallel to the requirements of customary international law. ‘Subsequent practice’ under Article 31(3)(b) VCLT in essences equals practice under Article 38(1)(b) of the Statute of the International Court of Justice (ICJ Statute)⁹⁷.⁹⁸ The main difference is that, in the context of treaty interpretation, a ‘specific’ practice of the parties to the treaty rather than a ‘general’ practice is required.⁹⁹ The ICJ made clear that the practice of States (accompanied by the required *opinio juris*) needs to be sufficiently general for formation of a rule of customary international law.¹⁰⁰ It must be ‘extensive’,¹⁰¹ ‘sufficiently widespread’¹⁰² and ‘broadly representative’,¹⁰³ in particular by those States whose interests are ‘specially affected’.¹⁰⁴ This means that it is not required to prove a positive practice of all parties at all times.¹⁰⁵ There is no strict standard on the exact number of States’ practices that must be positively proven.¹⁰⁶\n⁹¹.

Other States may have done nothing, but find themselves bound by the emerging rule’.¹⁰⁸\nFrom this follows that relevant silence may be considered a confirmation of the developing interpretative ‘agreement’.¹⁰⁹ Under what circumstance it does so, however, remains a much-contested issue in international legal practice and scholarship.¹¹⁰\nThe first question is: what kind of behaviour qualifies as silence? A clear case of silence is given if a State does not express itself at all in relation to the interpretation of a treaty and any of its provisions. Such behaviour qualifies as a verbal omission and therefore silence.¹¹¹ Generally, statements on the non-application of a treaty or a rule may qualify as relevant ‘subsequent practice’ and do not constitute silence.¹¹² A sufficient detailedness of the interpretative statement is not required. Inconsistent subsequent practice can be precluded from having a normative effect under the principle of estoppel.¹¹³ Hence, claims by some States that Article 51 UN Charter does not apply in cyberspace are devoid of normative effect, if these States have earlier acknowledged that the UN Charter applies in cyberspace.\nThe second question is whether the State’s intention to confirm a certain interpretation through its silence is decisive or whether we should apply objective criteria and rely on the recipient’s perspective.¹¹⁴ In a nutshell, voluntarists argue that States’ silence only has the legal effect that conforms to the will of the silent State.¹¹⁵ For those who support an objective\n107.

Attaching legal effect to States’ silence is a compensation for the ‘soft’ character of this ‘legislative responsibility’.¹²¹ In Starski’s view, such responsibility follows inter alia from a ‘constitutionalist’ reading of international law.¹²² In her view, the ‘eminent’ role of States in the process of law creation and evolution ‘endows states with a specific responsibility towards the effectivity of the international legal system’ which depends on a clarification of the law.¹²³ Only determinacy makes norms operational and allows us to distinguish law from non-law.¹²⁴\nStarski’s argument has merits for several reasons. To start with, the principle of good faith reflected in Article 31(1) VCLT requires States to fulfil their obligation as parties to a treaty, not to impede the effect of the treaty by perpetuating indeterminacy (under certain circumstances, as discussed below).¹²⁵\nWhile a ‘constitutionalist’ reading of international law invoked by Starski comes with challenges,¹²⁶ the ‘legislative responsibility takes account of the shift from a purely State-oriented international legal order of co-existence towards a legal order of cooperation that does not only serve States’ interests but also interests of an alleged ‘international commu\nGeneral Principles and Sources of Law’ (1953) 30 British Year Book of International Law 1, 68; Jacques Bentz, ‘Le silence comme manifestation de volonté en Droit international public’ (1963) 67 Revue Général de Droit International Public 44, 45.\n116.

As the ILC noted, ‘acceptance of a practice by one or more parties by way of silence or inaction is not easily established’.¹²⁹ In order to find a fair balance between the objectification of silence and consensualist concerns, a close scrutiny of the context and setting of the silence is required.¹³⁰ The important qualification is that we can infer consent from silence only – independent of the real intention of the State – if the ‘circumstances were such as called for some reaction’.¹³¹ Only if she must and can speak (*si loqui debuisset ac potuisset*), the neutral maxim that ‘she who keeps silent is held neither to deny nor to accept’ (*qui tacit neque negat, neque utique fatetur*) yields to the maxim that ‘she who keeps silent is held to consent’ (*qui tacit consentire videtur*).¹³²\nThe ILC has pointed to two factors that must be considered to establish whether the circumstances ‘called for some reaction’: ‘the legal situation to which the subsequent practice by the other party relates and the claim thereby expressed’.¹³³ If we break down these two broad criteria into more specific sub-criteria, we can identify nine factors that should be taken into account.¹³⁴\nThe first factor that should be considered is the nature of the State practice itself.¹³⁵ It is relevant whether the interpretative action was a singular event or whether it occurred frequently.¹³⁶ Moreover, it is relevant whether the interpretative action is consistent and whether it has become commonplace.¹³⁷ In this context, the element of time must also be considered: the longer States engage in a certain action, the higher the expectation is that other States react.¹³⁸\n127.

As Starski convincingly argues,\n[t]he very purpose of erga omnes norms would appear to be undermined if the non-protest of bystander states in light of their violation might more easily have a law-altering effect than in the case of ‘ordinary’ rules. ... The erga omnes dimension of norms creates a – rather fictitious – locus standi, but only to the benefit of a norm’s enforceability and not in order to enhance its alterability.¹⁵⁴\nThe eighth factor to be considered is ‘timeliness’.¹⁵⁵ The greater the impact of the proposed interpretation is on interests and rights of a State, the more it is to be expected that it responds in a timely manner.¹⁵⁶\nThe ninth and final factor concerns the nature of the affected rules in question.¹⁵⁷ If the rule in question enjoys a jus cogens or erga omnes status, the threshold for modification is set high. Jus cogens norms require a near-universal State practice and can only be substituted by a norm of the same nature (Article 53 VCLT). As such, silence ‘can only under very limited circumstances issue law formative effects in cases in which peremptory norms are at stake if the very concept of jus cogens is to be kept doctrinally intact’.¹⁵⁸\nIf we apply these standards to the practice of States to the discourse on jus contra bellum in cyberspace, it seems premature to conclude that the silence of States that have not engaged with interpretative proposals made by other States amounts to acquiescence in all contexts.\nTo give one illustrative example: many of those States that have published interpretative statements have endorsed the so-called ‘scale and effects’ test (or a version thereof)¹⁵⁹ that is based on the Nicaragua judgment of the ICJ.¹⁶⁰ Under the ‘scale and effects’ test, a cyber-operation constitutes a ‘use of force’ if its scale and effects are comparable to the scale and effects of a ‘traditional’ use of kinetic force.¹⁶¹\nDoes the silence of some States on whether they agree with this interpretation of the law amount to legally relevant acquiescence? Were the circumstances such that they called for some reaction according to the aforementioned standards?\nSeveral of those standards are met. Mere verbal and written statements may constitute relevant ‘subsequent practice’. Article 31(3)(b) VCLT does not require a physical action as\n(commentaries on Articles 48(1)(a) and 48(1)(b)).

The silent States had the capacity to act and were (or at least ought to be) aware of these interpretative statements (third factor). The statements were made in internationally significant contexts, such as before the UN GGE and UN OEWG, or through official channels, including homepages of ministries of foreign affairs, or other public fora (fourth factor). The jus contra bellum also consists of rules that are by their very nature volatile (fifth factor).\nHowever, if we look at the other relevant factors, it seems doubtful that the circumstances were already such that they called for some reaction. Arguably, the interpretative statements in relation to the ‘scale’ and ‘effect’ test are not sufficiently consistent and widespread (first factor). While there seems to be an agreement on the overall contours of this test and its applicability in cyberspace, there still seems disagreement on its precise scope, for example in relation to the question of whether cyber-operations causing severe non-physical consequences, such as an attack on the nation’s economic system, may also reach the threshold of a use of force. Several States seem to be in favour of this interpretation.¹⁶³ Others, however, seem to be sceptical or leave this question open.¹⁶⁴ It also seems doubtful that a sufficient number of States have publicly subscribed to an application of this test. The subsequent practice must be ‘extensive’¹⁶⁵ and ‘sufficiently widespread’¹⁶⁶ and ‘broadly representative’¹⁶⁷ among States, in particular those whose interests are ‘specially affected’.¹⁶⁸ While the number of States supporting this test is relatively large and seems to be growing, it does not comprise the majority of UN Member States yet. However, it is not unlikely that the relevant threshold will be met in the future, which would increase the expectation of reactions of bystanders.\nMoreover, most States who have begun to position themselves in favour of an application of the ‘scale’ and ‘effect’ in cyberspace test have done so only quite recently (first and eighth factor). The UN OEWG process, in whose context many States have made their statements, has also been only established relatively recently. However, the longer the UN OEWG process is ongoing, the higher the expectation is that other States react to interpretative proposals.\nAs the interpretative proposals relate to the UN Charter and potentially impact rights and interests of all States, one could argue that a reaction can be expected (sixth factor). On the other hand, as has been discussed above, the fact that the UN Charter jus contra bellum rules constitute erga omnes obligations and jus cogens¹⁶⁹ speaks against inferring too easily\n162.

If the rule in question enjoys a *jus cogens* or *erga omnes* status, the threshold for a conclusive interpretation is set very high.\nIn conclusion, good arguments speak in favour of not (yet) qualifying the silence as acquiescence to interpretations that support the ‘scale’ and ‘effect’ test. However, these findings are only a snapshot of the current situation. The more a common position crystallises among a sufficient number of states on the interpretation of the *jus contra bellum* in cyberspace (or specific elements thereof), the more that silent States need to position themselves to avoid their silence being interpreted as acquiescence.\nMoreover, as discussed in the next section, the lack of an interpretative agreement on the ‘scale’ and ‘effect’ test does not necessarily leave the law in limbo as objective interpretative factors must also be considered. International lawyers are justified in making an argument in favour of applying the ‘scale’ and ‘effect’ test to cyberspace on the basis of the wording, objective and purpose of the UN Charter, in light of ICJ jurisprudence (Article 38(1)(d) ICJ Statute).\n## 4.3 The interplay between subjective and objective factors in UN Charter interpretation\nContrary to what the freedom of State paradigm implies, the subjective interpretation of the parties of ‘how’ the UN Charter *jus contra bellum* applies in cyberspace is not the sole factor at play. The subjective interpretation of States is complemented by objective factors, including the ‘ordinary meaning’ of the terms of the treaty (Article 31(1) VCLT), the treaty’s ‘context’ and ‘object and purpose’ (Article 31(1) VCLT), agreements and instruments made with the conclusion of the treaty (Article 31(2) VCLT), and other ‘relevant rules of international law applicable in relations between the parties’ (Article 31(3)(c) VCLT). In treaty interpretation, subjective and objective factors do not stand in a hierarchical relationship with each other; their order merely represents the logical process of interpretation.¹⁷⁰ Subsequent practice is often used in interplay with the other means of interpretation in a ‘single combined operation’.¹⁷¹ At least, this observation holds true with regard to the practice of the ICJ.¹⁷²\nThe complementary interplay of subjective and objective elements in the interpretation of treaties that follows from Article 31 VLCT takes account of the shift from a purely State-oriented international legal order of co-existence towards a legal order of cooperation that has been discussed above.¹⁷³ While the traditional bilateral structure remains the basis to avoid international law sliding into utopianism, treaties have a normative force that is independent from States’ will.¹⁷⁴\n---\n¹⁷⁰.

In such circumstances, a non-liquet would have to be declared.¹⁷⁵ It would not be possible to determine the meaning of a provision.\nWhile it would go beyond the scope of the present paper to comprehensively discuss the possibility of gaps in the law, a few remarks should suffice. Although we find instances where courts have accepted a non-liquet,¹⁷⁶ judicial practice and scholarship are generally not willing to do so.¹⁷⁷ International rules are per se shrouded by uncertainty and indeterminacy (as any legal rules).¹⁷⁸ Allowing non-liquet would question the very functionality and effectiveness of international law. The judicial function of judges requires that they concretise norms and provide definite answers to legal questions.¹⁷⁹ The plurality of subjective and objective interpretative tools offered by Articles 31–32 VCLT strongly support the view that non-liquet should not be assumed. Important in this context is Article 31(3)(1) VCLT, which provides a pathway of general principles of international law into every interpretative exercise. General principles’ main function is filling gaps in the law, that is, to avoid lacunae left by the (application of the) other sources of international law.¹⁸⁰\nWhile the strategic inactivity of many States to publish their practice undoubtedly has negative consequences for the clarification of the jus contra bellum, it does not leave the law in limbo. The law stands despite the relative lack of States’ contribution to its clarification. Even if States establish a subsequent interpretative agreement in the sense of Article 31(1)(a) or (b) VCLT, such an agreement is only one factor among others that must be considered.\n## 4.5 The role of courts, organs of international organisations and the ILC and the lack of centralised interpretative authority\nAgainst this background, legal ambiguity in the present context is not the consequence of a gap in the law that follows from the interpretative silence of states; rather, it is a misnomer for the lack of centralised interpretative authority in international law. States are not the only relevant actors in the interpretation of international law. A number of institutional actors could potentially play an important role in the normative discourse on ‘how’ jus contra bellum applies in cyberspace, such as international courts and tribunals, organs of international organisations (most importantly UN organs), and the International Law Commission (ILC). However, none of these institutional actors has been equipped with the centralised authority to decide what the correct interpretation of the law is. As such, the clarification of the law is left to an open-ended discursive process.\n---\n¹⁷⁵. *Non liquet* transl. ‘it is not clear’.\n¹⁷⁶.

Even though the ICJ had for a while a considerable number of cases (directly or indirectly) concerning the use of force before it,¹⁸² this trend has not continued, and most of the cases did not make it to the merits.¹⁸³ Importantly for us, the Court has not dealt with questions concerning *jus contra bellum* in cyberspace and it is not likely that it will do so in the near future; other courts or tribunals that may take up the issues are also not in sight.\nWhile the UN GGE played a significant role as a facilitator of normative discourse, it has never been a platform that could have authoritatively determined the correct interpretation of the *jus contra bellum*. The UN GGE was not invested with the power to create new international law.¹⁸⁴ The reports of the UN GGE do not set legal norms themselves. Even if one supports the view that the practice of organs or sub-organs of international organisations may be directly relevant under Article 31–32 VCLT,¹⁸⁵ for example as relevant ‘subsequent practice’, good arguments speak against attaching significant weight to the practice of the UN GGE. The reports only represent the views of experts of a limited number of States (initially 15, now 25). What matters is the reception by all parties to the UN Charter and other international organs of the UN, such as the UN GA.\nThe UN GA may take up issues on *jus contra bellum* in cyberspace and has done so, for example by ‘taking note’ of the assessments and recommendations of the two first UN GGE reports (2010 and 2013) and by ‘welcoming’ the ‘conclusions’ of the third UN GGE report (2015, without a vote, meaning by consensus).¹⁸⁶ However, rather than constituting a centralised form of interpretation, the UN GA practice reflects the cumulative practice of individual States.¹⁸⁷\n---\n¹⁸¹ On the role of ‘judicial decisions’ as ‘subsidiary means, see Mads Andenas and Johann R Leiss, ‘The Systemic Relevance of “Judicial Decisions” in International Law’ (2017) 77 Zeitschrift für ausländisches öffentliches Recht und Völkerrecht 907, 934–935.\n¹⁸² Cf Christine Gray, ‘The Use and Abuse of the International Court of Justice: Cases concerning the Use of Force after Nicaragua’ (2003) 14 European Journal of International Law 867.

They consider it premature to involve the ILC at this stage, since the practice of States is as yet too scarce for the ILC to carry out a meaningful analysis.¹⁹³\nFor the future, however, it cannot be excluded that these actors will contribute to crystallisation of the ‘correct’ interpretation of the law. While their interpretation must (also) be grounded in the will of States, they will mainly process positive manifestations of those States that have actively made their position clear or, in the absence of a clearly identifiable common and consistent practice, have recourse to the objective means of interpretation.\n# 5. Conclusion\nThis article has discussed the politics and legal rationale behind the reluctance of some States to help clarify ‘how’ jus contra bellum applies in cyberspace. It has shown that interpretative silence may backfire in the long run. States’ silence may be interpreted – though only under strict conditions – as acquiescence to an emerging, widely accepted interpretation of the law. Moreover, objective factors beyond the subjective interpretation of States may come to the fore if too many States remain silent and thereby prevent the crystallisation of a sufficiently widely accepted interpretation of the law.\nIn light of these findings, initiatives that encourage States to make their positions publicly available are to be welcomed from a rule of law perspective.¹⁹⁴ They are also in States’ own interests. The vital role of the jus contra bellum rules for the maintenance of peace and security requires interpretative clarity to ensure their efficiency and transparency.

Moreover, interpretation and development of the law would be left to military considerations that all too easily exclude other concerns.\nWhether these calls for more interpretative activity will make the UN OEWG process more successful than the UN GGE remains to be seen. It is more inclusive than the UN GGE and allows more States to be heard. However, the first impression does not seem very promising. The UN OEWG’s initial pre-draft and final report have not added anything substantive to the work of the UN GGE in matters of jus contra bellum in cyberspace.196\nIf the global dialogue on jus contra bellum in cyberspace remains unsuccessful, it seems likely that the path will steer away from global initiatives towards regional processes among like-minded states or even bilateral agreements.197 The US has already indicated that they would consider focusing on ‘likeminded partners’ to tackle cybersecurity issues.198 Likewise, Russia increasingly turns towards the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO).199 Other regional platforms are also becoming involved in cybersecurity issues, such as the Organization of American States, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Regional Forum, the Economic Community of West African States, the African Union, the European Union,200 the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe,201 and the Council of Europe.\nWhile the greater involvement of regional processes in the normative discourse is not a bad thing per se, the universal character of the UN Charter requires universal solutions to avoid ‘fragmentation of the international norms discourse’.202\n## Acknowledgment\nWork on this paper has been conducted under the aegis of the project ‘Security in Internet Governance and Networks: Analysing the Law’ (SIGNAL), funded by the Norwegian Research Council and UNINETT Norid AS.

In its main part, the article analyses the (legal) consequences of interpretative silence and challenges its (presumably) underlying rationale – that is, a strategy of legal ambiguity based on the traditional 'freedom of State' paradigm. This article argues that it is only by actively contributing to the clarification of the law that States ensure their voice is heard and avoid the risk that their silence is interpreted as acquiescence. Moreover, contrary to what the freedom of State paradigm implies, the subjective interpretation of the parties is not the only 'game in town'. If no interpretative agreement of States crystallises, the interpretation of jus contra bellum is determined by objective factors. The article concludes by arguing that from a rule of law perspective, States should be encouraged to express their views on 'how' jus contra bellum applies in cyberspace to ensure the efficiency and transparency of these rules, which constitute part of the backbone of a peaceful co-existence and cooperation between states.\n## Keywords\njus contra bellum, cyberwarfare, treaty interpretation, acquiescence, UN GGE, UN OEWG\n## 1. Introduction\nAmong the great challenges to international law posed by the digitisation of our modern world is the fact that modern warfare has expanded into cyberspace. As with any technical developments in human history, warfare has taken up new digital technologies. Modern armies have the capability to cause death and destruction via cyberspace. At the same time, societies have become increasingly vulnerable. Much critical infrastructure is digitalised,\n1.

Cyber-operations may, as Roscini writes, ‘disable power generators, cut off the military command, control, and communication systems, cause trains to derail and aeroplanes to crash, nuclear reactors to melt down, pipelines to explode, weapons to malfunction, banking systems to cripple’. The possible modes of ‘cyberwarfare’ range from small-scale operations – some sort of web vandalism – to severe attacks on critical infrastructure. Geographical distance and time become less relevant; any target can be hit within seconds from any place in the world that has an internet connection.\nThe fundamental question of whether the law on the use of force (the *jus ad bellum*; or in modern parlance *jus contra bellum*) as enshrined in Articles 2(4) and 51 of the Charter of the United Nations (‘UN Charter’) and in their customary equivalents apply to cyberspace seems to have been settled by now. These rules apply to cyberspace. This is confirmed by numerous statements of States and by the outputs of the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing responsible State behaviour in cyberspace in the context of international security (‘UN GGE’) and the United Nations Open-Ended Working Group on Developments in the Field of ICTs in the Context of International Security (‘UN OEWG’). The 2013 consensus report of the third UN GGE noted in general terms that international law and, in particular, the UN Charter applies in cyberspace. The following 2015 and 2021 reports of the fourth and sixth UN GGEs made clear that the UN Charter ‘applies in its entirety’.\nHowever, there is still much uncertainty on exactly ‘how’ these rules apply. To give just\n4. Roscini, *Cyber Operations and the Use of Force* (n 2) 1–2; and already in Roscini, ‘World Wide Warfare’ (n 3) 86–87.\n5.

Today, *jus ad bellum* is increasingly referred to as *jus contra bellum*, cf Olivier Corten, *The Law Against War: The Prohibition on the Use of Force in Contemporary International Law* (Hart 2012) passim; Delerue (n 1) 275. Note that this article is concerned with *jus contra bellum* issues but not *jus in bello* issues, the latter referring to the question of how the laws of war would govern the use of cyber-attacks during an ongoing armed conflict.\n10. Charter of the United Nations (opened for signature 26 June 1945, entered into force 24 October 1945) 3 Bevans 1153. The *jus contra bellum* also includes Chapter 7, Article 42 UN Charter, which deals with UN Security Council authorization.\n11. Cf Delerue (n 1) 1–2.\n12. The UN GGE was established in 2002 by the UN Secretary-General at the request of the UN General Assembly, cf A/Res/56/19 (2002). Since 2004, six working groups have been convened, with the last one in 2019, cf 2004/2005 A/RES/58/32 (2003); 2009/2010 A/RES/60/45 (2006); 2012/2013 A/RES/66/24 (2011); 2014/2015 A/RES/68/243 (2014); 2016/2017 A/RES/70/237 (2015); 2019/2021 A/RES/73/266 (2019). The UN GGE reports to the UN General Assembly. The UN General Assembly considered and endorsed – by consensus – the 2010, 2013 and 2015 UN GGE reports, cf A/RES/65/41 (2011); A/RES/68/243 (2014); A/RES/70/237 (2015). Up until recently, the UN GGE was the primary inter-state forum for discussions on the legal regulation of cyberspace, cf Anders Henriksen, ‘The End of the Road for the UN GGE Process: The Future Regulation of Cyberspace’ (2019) 5 (1) *Journal of Cybersecurity*, 1; Martha Finnemore and Kathryn Sikkink, ‘International Norm Dynamics and Political Change’ (1998) 52 *International Organ* 887.

What kind of activities constitute an ‘armed attack’ and might give a State cause to invoke its inherent right to self-defence (Article 51 UN Charter)? Where along the spectrum of permissible to impermissible conduct do various types of cyber-attacks lie? How is mere cyber-criminality to be distinguished from warfare? Should we apply the so-called ‘scale and effects’ test according to which a cyberoperation constitutes a ‘use of force’ if its scale and effects are comparable to the scale and effects of a ‘traditional’ use of kinetic force? How can we attribute use of force in cyberspace? More generally, how do we apply rules that are based on the existence of geographical borders, over which States exercise sovereignty, to cyberspace, in which such borders are far from distinct?\nConsidering these open questions, it is all the more remarkable that many States shy away from actively contributing to the interpretative clarification of the law. They do not publish interpretative statements and do not make their practice of cyberwarfare public.\nPart 2 discusses the (in)activity of States to contribute to the interpretative clarification of ‘how’ jus contra bellum applies in cyberspace and discusses its negative repercussions for the work of the UN GGE and UN OEWG. Part 3 discusses possible explanations for the (legal) politics behind this interpretative silence. It argues that silence can be explained by a strategy of legal ambiguity, which finds its legal rationale in the traditional ‘freedom of State’ paradigm. The aim of this strategy is to keep the jus contra bellum in limbo and open scope for manoeuvre to cope with new technical developments and remaining strategic uncertainties in cyberwarfare.\nPart 4 discusses the (legal) consequences of interpretative silence and challenges its underlying rationale. The argument is that under the discursive framework provided by Articles 31–33 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (‘VCLT’), the interpretation – or non-interpretation – of the parties to a treaty remains a central factor to be taken into account. However, it is only by actively contributing to the clarification of the law that States ensure their voice is heard and avoid the risk that their silence is interpreted as acquiescence. Moreover, contrary to what the freedom of State paradigm implies, the subjective interpretation of the parties is not the only ‘game in town’. Articles 31–32 VCLT and other factors complement the subjective dimension of interpretation with an objective one. The less the ‘authentic’ interpretation of the parties leads to interpretative clarification, the more the other modes of interpretation come to the fore. As such, legal ambiguity is a misnomer for the lack of centralised interpretative authority in international law. Part 5 concludes.\n---\n Cf Initial ‘pre-draft’ of the report of the UN OEWG <https: 03=\"\" 200311-pre-draft-oewg-ict.pdf=\"\" 2020=\"\" unoda-web.s3.amazonaws.com=\"\" wp-content=\"\" uploads=\"\" wp=\"\"> (‘UN OEWG pre-draft’) [27].

Interpretative silence and jus contra bellum in cyberspace\n### 2.1 Jus contra bellum in cyberspace – a question of UN Charter interpretation\nThe present article presumes that questions concerning the application of *jus contra bellum* to cyberspace are first and foremost a matter of UN Charter interpretation. In the author’s view, the UN Charter-based *jus contra bellum* norms and their customary corollaries have merged into a single norm, even though the customary manifestation is based in a different source, and insofar remains conceptually independent from its treaty corollary. Article 103 UN Charter, which attaches supremacy to UN Charter law over other international law, also applies to customary international law. As such, customary derogation from the UN Charter based *jus contra bellum* is excluded.\nUnder what conditions an interpretation of UN Charter law amounts to a modification of the rules in question must not be conclusively discussed here. While further development of the Charter by consensual re-interpretation and customary application is possible, for the present purpose it is sufficient to keep in mind that it is not easily to be presumed that States want to circumvent the strict requirements for Charter amendments (Articles 108 and 109 UN Charter). There are, however, notable examples of informal UN Charter modification.\n### 2.2 Widespread interpretative silence\nConsidering the overall picture, we see that many States remain reluctant to clearly position themselves and contribute to a clarification of ‘how’ *jus contra bellum* applies in cyberspace. An increasing number of States have published ‘cyber security strategies’, and a growing number of States have also begun to publish statements on international law in cyberspace.\n---\n21.

However, some States continue to question whether the UN Charter provides a sufficient regulatory framework and whether Article 51 UN Charter (self-defence) also applies in cyberspace – despite the rather clear formulation in the 2013 and 2021 reports of the UN GGE that the UN Charter ‘applies in its entirety’. For example, Russia, China and Cuba reportedly opposed an explicit reference to the right to self-defence in the 2017 UN GGE report, which seems to have been a principal reason for the group’s failure to deliver a consensus report.

As such, Russia is a fierce advocate of a new international legal regime for cyberwarfare.\n## 2.3 The limited success of the UN GGE and UN OEWG\nThe UN GGE’s process has hitherto failed to contribute much to the clarification of ‘how’ *jus contra bellum* applies in cyberspace beyond the acknowledgment that the UN Charter applies ‘in its entirety’. Good arguments speak in favour of assuming that this failure is – at least to a certain extent – a consequence of the remaining unwillingness of many States to clarify their interpretative positions.\nAfter the failure of the first UN GGE (15 members) to deliver a final report, it was commonly agreed that the topic required further discussion. The second group of experts (again 15 members) eventually managed to reach an agreement on a short 2010 consensus report. However, this report only contained a few rudimentary findings and recommendations. It acknowledged the problem of attribution of cyberoperations and risk of potential threats, the ‘absence of a common understanding regarding acceptable State behaviour’, and more generally, the ‘lack of shared understanding regarding international norms pertaining to State use of ICTs’. Furthermore, it noted that ‘[e]xisting agreements include norms relevant to the use of ICTs by States’, that ‘additional norms could be developed over time’, and that the dialogue should continue.\nIn 2011, a third group of experts (again 15 members) was set up. This time the mandate of the group specifically asked not only for a discussion of ‘international concepts aimed at\n37.

The third group submitted in 2013 a consensus report reemphasising the findings of the previous report. Importantly, the report noted for the first time explicitly that international law and in particular the UN Charter apply in cyberspace.\nIn December 2013, a fourth group of governmental experts was established, with their number increased to 20 members. The mandate of the fourth group included now specifically the question of ‘how’ international law applies in cyberspace. In 2015, the fourth group elaborated on some of the findings of the two previous UN GGE reports in a new consensus report. The group went further than the previous report by not only affirming in general terms that the UN Charter applies, but by explicitly noting that it ‘applies in its entirety’ and that States have an ‘inherent right …to take measures consistent with international law and as recognized in the Charter’. Moreover, it included explicit references to ‘the principles of humanity, necessity, proportionality and distinction’ and the obligation on States not to ‘use proxies to commit internationally wrongful acts using ICTs’ and to ‘ensure that their territory is not used by non-State actors to commit such acts’. Again, however, the report did not go into further detail and noted that there was a ‘need for further study on this matter’. In addition, the report included ‘recommendations for consideration by States for voluntary, non-binding norms, rules or principles of responsible behaviour of States aimed at promoting an open, secure, stable, accessible and peaceful ICT environment’. Many of these non-binding norms simply resemble what is already codified in international law as binding norms. As such, the report did not add much to the clarification of ‘how’ jus contra bellum applies in cyberspace.\nIn 2015, a fifth group of experts was established, again with an increased number of members (now 25). This time, however, the discussions proved even more difficult than in the previous rounds. In June 2017, the experts failed to agree on a draft for a consensus report. As previously mentioned, one explanation is that Cuba, China and Russia opposed the inclusion of references to the application of the right to self-defence (and the general international law principles of countermeasures and international humanitarian law).\n46. ibid.\n47.

The group delivered a report in 2021 and thus broke through the stalemate of the previous round. However, it did not add much in terms of substance to the clarification of the law. The report reaffirmed that international law, in particular the UN Charter ‘in its entirety’, applies in cyberspace (explicitly including the prohibition on the use of force) and noted again ‘the inherent right of States to take measures consistent with international law and as recognized in the Charter’.\nWhether the UN OEWG, as a more inclusive platform, will be more successful in clarifying the law remains to be seen. So far, the outcomes of the UN OEWG process have been rather limited. They do not go beyond the findings of the UN GGE. In its initial pre-draft from April 2020 and in its final substantive report from 10 March 2021, the UN OEWG noted that States reaffirmed the application of international law, and in particular UN Charter law, to cyberspace.\nIt would go too far to claim that the unwillingness of some States to publish their interpretations and to stay silent is the only reason for the failure of the UN GGE and the UN OEWG to provide more interpretative clarity. Interpretative activity may also lead to disagreement. However, interpretative engagement could have at least paved the way for finding common ground. This is also supported by the recommendations of the UN OEWG pre-draft and final reports, which emphasise the need for further information on the views and practice of States in relation to ‘how’ international law applies in cyberspace.\n# 3. The (legal) politics of silence\nHow can we explain the reluctance of States to refrain from submitting their legal positions on the interpretation of the jus contra bellum in cyberspace and the preference of some to foster new law-making instead of clarifying existing law? As States rarely explain the reasons for their silence, we can only speculate on their motives. A convincing explanation is that their choice for inactivity is driven by a preference for legal ambiguity, which finds its legal rationale in the traditional ‘freedom of State’ paradigm.\nThe discussion on the regulation of cyberwarfare is not only about the correct interpretation of the law but it ‘is as much about strategy, politics and ideological differences’. The interpretative approaches chosen by States often reflect their broader strategical interests, which coincide with their economic, military and technical capacities. Historically this has always been the case; the new reality of cyberwarfare has not changed this. How States interpret jus contra bellum in cyberspace is not independent of their respective ICT strengths and\n. A/RES/73/266 (2019).\n. A/76/135 (2021).\n. ibid [69] and [71(d)].\n.

Moreover, States' interpretations are influenced by their more fundamental ideological perspective on the openness of the internet.\nYet, how does the choice for staying silent fit in this picture? One possible explanation is that States wait for further technical developments before they formulate their own interpretative approaches. The speed and unpredictability of the development of new digital technologies create enormous strategic uncertainties. While economical resources and technical capacities are also of great importance in the context of cyberwarfare, the open structure of cyberspace seems to have re-shuffled many of the old certainties. Small States with a limited budget and little conventional military power can conduct military measures which have a large-scale effect in almost every corner of the world. Despite their strong conventional military powers, traditional strong military and economic powers feel increasingly vulnerable due to their strong digital connectedness. Against the background of these strategic uncertainties, it seems to be – at least at first glance – a rational choice for States to aim at paralysing legal clarification and perpetuating legal uncertainty, as they cannot sufficiently predict the long-term consequences of their own legal interpretation.\nFrom a legal-theoretical perspective, this choice of strategic ambiguity can only be explained by the traditional so-called ‘freedom of State’ paradigm. This state-oriented and subjective perspective paradigm considers the freedom and the will of States paramount. It found its most famous manifestation in the Lotus dictum of the Permanent Court of International Justice in 1927. The court held that\ninternational law governs relations between independent States. The rules of law binding upon States therefore emanate from their own free will as expressed in conventions or by usage generally accepted as expressing principles of law and established in order to regulate the relations between these co-existing independent communities or with a view to the achievement of common aims. Restrictions on the independence of States cannot therefore presumed.\nFrom this perspective, States are only bound by the extent to which they have consented to the rule of international law. Not only the formation of rules, but also their interpretation, follows this paradigm. In an earlier judgment, the PCIJ stated in relation to the interpretation of international law that ‘it is an established principle that the right of giving an authoritative interpretation of a legal rule belongs solely to the person or body who has power to modify or suppress it’. From this point of view, the freedom of State remains the residual rule. Indeterminacy plays into the hand of States.

If States remain silent, they remain free to do what they want.75\nAlternative explanations for interpretative silence do not convince. Disinterest in the topic seems a rather unlikely explanation, given the great relevance of cyber security in contemporary politics. Disagreement among different branches of the government is another possible explanation.76 However, this author is not aware of any such conflicts between different branches of the government within silent States. Coercion of less powerful States to remain silent due to certain power structures and dependencies in international politics (eg of military or economic nature) may also explain their silence. However, the author is not aware of any concrete cases. A final explanation could be that some States have voiced scepticism against the UN GGE. For example, Russia has referred to the UN GGE as ‘a narrow’ and ‘elitist’ expert platform and criticised the report of the UN OEWG for its linkage to the findings of the UN GGE.77 However, this attitude does not explain a general reluctance of States to position themselves outside of the UN GGE context, for example in the more inclusive forum of the UN OEWG.\n## 4. The (legal) consequence of interpretative silence\n## 4.1 States’ interpretation as ‘subsequent practice’\nTo start with the obvious: no State alone can determine the law with a binding effect for itself or for others by positively interpreting it or by not interpreting it. As Weiler and Haltern have argued, ‘autointerpretation, by each state individually, is mostly accepted as a practical inevitability with little, if any, normative value’.78 While States are usually the first and often also the last interpreters of the law (in the absence of delegation of interpretative authority, for example to an international court), it is wrong to claim that ‘each State establishes for itself its legal situation vis-à-vis other States’.79 To state otherwise would go against one of the cornerstones of the international legal order: the equality of States.80 Just as a single State\n75.

Does it matter that some States publish statements on the interpretation of the *jus contra bellum* in cyberspace whereas others refrain from doing so? Does the strategic inactivity leave the law in limbo?\n81.

As a general rule, an ‘agreement’ in the sense of Article 31(3)(a) or (b) must be ‘established’ and therefore it must be positively identifiable. A ‘subsequent agreement’ (lit a) must be clearly manifested (though not necessarily in written form) and *ipso facto* constitutes an ‘authentic interpretation’. For ‘subsequent practice’ (lit b), it must be shown that the understanding is common to the parties of the treaties by evincing a ‘particular conduct or circumstances’ through which an agreement can be identified indirectly. Therefore, ‘a subsequent agreement’ is typically easier to prove than a ‘subsequent practice’.\nA strict threshold of how many States must actively engage in a subsequent practice under lit b is difficult to establish. As a general rule, the value of the subsequent practice ‘depends on the extent to which it is concordant, common and consistent’. Here we can draw a parallel to the requirements of customary international law. ‘Subsequent practice’ under Article 31(3)(b) VCLT in essences equals practice under Article 38(1)(b) of the Statute of the International Court of Justice (ICJ Statute). The main difference is that, in the context of treaty interpretation, a ‘specific’ practice of the parties to the treaty rather than a ‘general’ practice is required. The ICJ made clear that the practice of States (accompanied by the required *opinio juris*) needs to be sufficiently general for formation of a rule of customary international law. It must be ‘extensive’, ‘sufficiently widespread’ and ‘broadly representative’, in particular by those States whose interests are ‘specially affected’. This means that it is not required to prove a positive practice of all parties at all times. There is no strict standard on the exact number of States’ practices that must be positively proven.\n.

It can be sufficient to show that ‘[s]ome States actively create a practice, some by initiating it, some by imitating it, and others by acquiescing in it. Other States may have done nothing, but find themselves bound by the emerging rule’.\nFrom this follows that relevant silence may be considered a confirmation of the developing interpretative ‘agreement’. Under what circumstance it does so, however, remains a much-contested issue in international legal practice and scholarship.\nThe first question is: what kind of behaviour qualifies as silence? A clear case of silence is given if a State does not express itself at all in relation to the interpretation of a treaty and any of its provisions. Such behaviour qualifies as a verbal omission and therefore silence. Generally, statements on the non-application of a treaty or a rule may qualify as relevant ‘subsequent practice’ and do not constitute silence. A sufficient detailedness of the interpretative statement is not required. Inconsistent subsequent practice can be precluded from having a normative effect under the principle of estoppel. Hence, claims by some States that Article 51 UN Charter does not apply in cyberspace are devoid of normative effect, if these States have earlier acknowledged that the UN Charter applies in cyberspace.\nThe second question is whether the State’s intention to confirm a certain interpretation through its silence is decisive or whether we should apply objective criteria and rely on the recipient’s perspective. In a nutshell, voluntarists argue that States’ silence only has the legal effect that conforms to the will of the silent State. For those who support an objective\n107.

For example, Starski argues that ‘silence will never reveal the true beliefs of an actor: “belief” will necessarily be constructed merely from the contextual setting’. In addition, she suggests that international law imposes on States a ‘legislative responsibility’ to engage in active interpretation if the circumstances have called for some reaction to ensure international law’s effectivity and legal certainty. This ‘legislative responsibility’ is only a soft obligation (in German ‘Obliegenheit’, which can be translated into ‘incumbency’) that is not enforceable and sanctionable. Attaching legal effect to States’ silence is a compensation for the ‘soft’ character of this ‘legislative responsibility’. In Starski’s view, such responsibility follows inter alia from a ‘constitutionalist’ reading of international law. In her view, the ‘eminent’ role of States in the process of law creation and evolution ‘endows states with a specific responsibility towards the effectivity of the international legal system’ which depends on a clarification of the law. Only determinacy makes norms operational and allows us to distinguish law from non-law.\nStarski’s argument has merits for several reasons. To start with, the principle of good faith reflected in Article 31(1) VCLT requires States to fulfil their obligation as parties to a treaty, not to impede the effect of the treaty by perpetuating indeterminacy (under certain circumstances, as discussed below).\nWhile a ‘constitutionalist’ reading of international law invoked by Starski comes with challenges, the ‘legislative responsibility takes account of the shift from a purely State-oriented international legal order of co-existence towards a legal order of cooperation that does not only serve States’ interests but also interests of an alleged ‘international commu\nGeneral Principles and Sources of Law’ (1953) 30 British Year Book of International Law 1, 68; Jacques Bentz, ‘Le silence comme manifestation de volonté en Droit international public’ (1963) 67 Revue Général de Droit International Public 44, 45.\n116.

As the ILC noted, ‘acceptance of a practice by one or more parties by way of silence or inaction is not easily established’. In order to find a fair balance between the objectification of silence and consensualist concerns, a close scrutiny of the context and setting of the silence is required. The important qualification is that we can infer consent from silence only – independent of the real intention of the State – if the ‘circumstances were such as called for some reaction’. Only if she must and can speak (*si loqui debuisset ac potuisset*), the neutral maxim that ‘she who keeps silent is held neither to deny nor to accept’ (*qui tacit neque negat, neque utique fatetur*) yields to the maxim that ‘she who keeps silent is held to consent’ (*qui tacit consentire videtur*).\nThe ILC has pointed to two factors that must be considered to establish whether the circumstances ‘called for some reaction’: ‘the legal situation to which the subsequent practice by the other party relates and the claim thereby expressed’. If we break down these two broad criteria into more specific sub-criteria, we can identify nine factors that should be taken into account.\nThe first factor that should be considered is the nature of the State practice itself. It is relevant whether the interpretative action was a singular event or whether it occurred frequently. Moreover, it is relevant whether the interpretative action is consistent and whether it has become commonplace. In this context, the element of time must also be considered: the longer States engage in a certain action, the higher the expectation is that other States react.\n127.

Only if the State claims that its conduct is in conformity with the law can a reaction by other States be legitimately expected. However, this is often difficult to establish in practice.\nThe third factor is whether the silent State was aware (which would be difficult to prove) or 'ought to have been aware' of the conduct of the other State. Moreover, the State must have had the capacity to act.\nThe fourth factor that needs to be included in the assessment is the context in which the relevant claim was made. The more internationally significant a context is, the more it can be expected that States react to claims made in this context. For example, UN organs constitute a highly significant context for claims made in relation to the interpretation of the UN Charter. The more volatile a rule is (either due to ongoing discourses over its meaning, or due to its generally vague character), the more it is expected that States react to claims made by other States. Power relations between States (eg of military or economic nature) must only be considered under certain exceptional circumstances (such as fraud, corruption or threat or coercion by the threat or use of force).\nThe fifth factor concerns the reactions of other actors. If we find ourselves in a situation of accelerating interpretative discourse (indicating increased normative volatility), there can be a higher expectation that 'bystanders' react.\nThe sixth factor to be considered is the impact of the proposed interpretation on rights and interests of States. The more the rights and interests of the State are affected, the more a reaction can be expected. Good arguments, however, speak in favour of not automatically inferring acquiescence in relation to the interpretation of *jus contra bellum*, even though as *erga omnes* obligations the *jus contra bellum* rules embody the interests of the whole international community, which includes every State.

As Starski convincingly argues,\n[t]he very purpose of erga omnes norms would appear to be undermined if the non-protest of bystander states in light of their violation might more easily have a law-altering effect than in the case of ‘ordinary’ rules. ... The erga omnes dimension of norms creates a – rather fictitious – locus standi, but only to the benefit of a norm’s enforceability and not in order to enhance its alterability.\nThe eighth factor to be considered is ‘timeliness’. The greater the impact of the proposed interpretation is on interests and rights of a State, the more it is to be expected that it responds in a timely manner.\nThe ninth and final factor concerns the nature of the affected rules in question. If the rule in question enjoys a jus cogens or erga omnes status, the threshold for modification is set high. Jus cogens norms require a near-universal State practice and can only be substituted by a norm of the same nature (Article 53 VCLT). As such, silence ‘can only under very limited circumstances issue law formative effects in cases in which peremptory norms are at stake if the very concept of jus cogens is to be kept doctrinally intact’.\nIf we apply these standards to the practice of States to the discourse on jus contra bellum in cyberspace, it seems premature to conclude that the silence of States that have not engaged with interpretative proposals made by other States amounts to acquiescence in all contexts.\nTo give one illustrative example: many of those States that have published interpretative statements have endorsed the so-called ‘scale and effects’ test (or a version thereof) that is based on the Nicaragua judgment of the ICJ. Under the ‘scale and effects’ test, a cyber-operation constitutes a ‘use of force’ if its scale and effects are comparable to the scale and effects of a ‘traditional’ use of kinetic force.\nDoes the silence of some States on whether they agree with this interpretation of the law amount to legally relevant acquiescence? Were the circumstances such that they called for some reaction according to the aforementioned standards?\nSeveral of those standards are met. Mere verbal and written statements may constitute relevant ‘subsequent practice’. Article 31(3)(b) VCLT does not require a physical action as\n(commentaries on Articles 48(1)(a) and 48(1)(b)).

The claims relating to the ‘scale’ and ‘effect’ are meant to provide an interpretation of the law and not an explanation of unlawful behaviour (second factor). The silent States had the capacity to act and were (or at least ought to be) aware of these interpretative statements (third factor). The statements were made in internationally significant contexts, such as before the UN GGE and UN OEWG, or through official channels, including homepages of ministries of foreign affairs, or other public fora (fourth factor). The jus contra bellum also consists of rules that are by their very nature volatile (fifth factor).\nHowever, if we look at the other relevant factors, it seems doubtful that the circumstances were already such that they called for some reaction. Arguably, the interpretative statements in relation to the ‘scale’ and ‘effect’ test are not sufficiently consistent and widespread (first factor). While there seems to be an agreement on the overall contours of this test and its applicability in cyberspace, there still seems disagreement on its precise scope, for example in relation to the question of whether cyber-operations causing severe non-physical consequences, such as an attack on the nation’s economic system, may also reach the threshold of a use of force. Several States seem to be in favour of this interpretation. Others, however, seem to be sceptical or leave this question open. It also seems doubtful that a sufficient number of States have publicly subscribed to an application of this test. The subsequent practice must be ‘extensive’ and ‘sufficiently widespread’ and ‘broadly representative’ among States, in particular those whose interests are ‘specially affected’. While the number of States supporting this test is relatively large and seems to be growing, it does not comprise the majority of UN Member States yet. However, it is not unlikely that the relevant threshold will be met in the future, which would increase the expectation of reactions of bystanders.\nMoreover, most States who have begun to position themselves in favour of an application of the ‘scale’ and ‘effect’ in cyberspace test have done so only quite recently (first and eighth factor). The UN OEWG process, in whose context many States have made their statements, has also been only established relatively recently. However, the longer the UN OEWG process is ongoing, the higher the expectation is that other States react to interpretative proposals.\nAs the interpretative proposals relate to the UN Charter and potentially impact rights and interests of all States, one could argue that a reaction can be expected (sixth factor). On the other hand, as has been discussed above, the fact that the UN Charter jus contra bellum rules constitute erga omnes obligations and jus cogens speaks against inferring too easily\n162.

If the rule in question enjoys a *jus cogens* or *erga omnes* status, the threshold for a conclusive interpretation is set very high.\nIn conclusion, good arguments speak in favour of not (yet) qualifying the silence as acquiescence to interpretations that support the ‘scale’ and ‘effect’ test. However, these findings are only a snapshot of the current situation. The more a common position crystallises among a sufficient number of states on the interpretation of the *jus contra bellum* in cyberspace (or specific elements thereof), the more that silent States need to position themselves to avoid their silence being interpreted as acquiescence.\nMoreover, as discussed in the next section, the lack of an interpretative agreement on the ‘scale’ and ‘effect’ test does not necessarily leave the law in limbo as objective interpretative factors must also be considered. International lawyers are justified in making an argument in favour of applying the ‘scale’ and ‘effect’ test to cyberspace on the basis of the wording, objective and purpose of the UN Charter, in light of ICJ jurisprudence (Article 38(1)(d) ICJ Statute).\n## 4.3 The interplay between subjective and objective factors in UN Charter interpretation\nContrary to what the freedom of State paradigm implies, the subjective interpretation of the parties of ‘how’ the UN Charter *jus contra bellum* applies in cyberspace is not the sole factor at play. The subjective interpretation of States is complemented by objective factors, including the ‘ordinary meaning’ of the terms of the treaty (Article 31(1) VCLT), the treaty’s ‘context’ and ‘object and purpose’ (Article 31(1) VCLT), agreements and instruments made with the conclusion of the treaty (Article 31(2) VCLT), and other ‘relevant rules of international law applicable in relations between the parties’ (Article 31(3)(c) VCLT). In treaty interpretation, subjective and objective factors do not stand in a hierarchical relationship with each other; their order merely represents the logical process of interpretation. Subsequent practice is often used in interplay with the other means of interpretation in a ‘single combined operation’. At least, this observation holds true with regard to the practice of the ICJ.\nThe complementary interplay of subjective and objective elements in the interpretation of treaties that follows from Article 31 VLCT takes account of the shift from a purely State-oriented international legal order of co-existence towards a legal order of cooperation that has been discussed above. While the traditional bilateral structure remains the basis to avoid international law sliding into utopianism, treaties have a normative force that is independent from States’ will.\n---\n.

In such circumstances, a non-liquet would have to be declared. It would not be possible to determine the meaning of a provision.\nWhile it would go beyond the scope of the present paper to comprehensively discuss the possibility of gaps in the law, a few remarks should suffice. Although we find instances where courts have accepted a non-liquet, judicial practice and scholarship are generally not willing to do so. International rules are per se shrouded by uncertainty and indeterminacy (as any legal rules). Allowing non-liquet would question the very functionality and effectiveness of international law. The judicial function of judges requires that they concretise norms and provide definite answers to legal questions. The plurality of subjective and objective interpretative tools offered by Articles 31–32 VCLT strongly support the view that non-liquet should not be assumed. Important in this context is Article 31(3)(1) VCLT, which provides a pathway of general principles of international law into every interpretative exercise. General principles’ main function is filling gaps in the law, that is, to avoid lacunae left by the (application of the) other sources of international law.\nWhile the strategic inactivity of many States to publish their practice undoubtedly has negative consequences for the clarification of the jus contra bellum, it does not leave the law in limbo. The law stands despite the relative lack of States’ contribution to its clarification. Even if States establish a subsequent interpretative agreement in the sense of Article 31(1)(a) or (b) VCLT, such an agreement is only one factor among others that must be considered.\n## 4.5 The role of courts, organs of international organisations and the ILC and the lack of centralised interpretative authority\nAgainst this background, legal ambiguity in the present context is not the consequence of a gap in the law that follows from the interpretative silence of states; rather, it is a misnomer for the lack of centralised interpretative authority in international law. States are not the only relevant actors in the interpretation of international law. A number of institutional actors could potentially play an important role in the normative discourse on ‘how’ jus contra bellum applies in cyberspace, such as international courts and tribunals, organs of international organisations (most importantly UN organs), and the International Law Commission (ILC). However, none of these institutional actors has been equipped with the centralised authority to decide what the correct interpretation of the law is. As such, the clarification of the law is left to an open-ended discursive process.\n---\n. *Non liquet* transl. ‘it is not clear’.\n.

However, in matters of *jus contra bellum* in cyberspace, international courts and tribunals often lack the jurisdiction to provide interpretative clarification. Even though the ICJ had for a while a considerable number of cases (directly or indirectly) concerning the use of force before it, this trend has not continued, and most of the cases did not make it to the merits. Importantly for us, the Court has not dealt with questions concerning *jus contra bellum* in cyberspace and it is not likely that it will do so in the near future; other courts or tribunals that may take up the issues are also not in sight.\nWhile the UN GGE played a significant role as a facilitator of normative discourse, it has never been a platform that could have authoritatively determined the correct interpretation of the *jus contra bellum*. The UN GGE was not invested with the power to create new international law. The reports of the UN GGE do not set legal norms themselves. Even if one supports the view that the practice of organs or sub-organs of international organisations may be directly relevant under Article 31–32 VCLT, for example as relevant ‘subsequent practice’, good arguments speak against attaching significant weight to the practice of the UN GGE. The reports only represent the views of experts of a limited number of States (initially 15, now 25). What matters is the reception by all parties to the UN Charter and other international organs of the UN, such as the UN GA.\nThe UN GA may take up issues on *jus contra bellum* in cyberspace and has done so, for example by ‘taking note’ of the assessments and recommendations of the two first UN GGE reports (2010 and 2013) and by ‘welcoming’ the ‘conclusions’ of the third UN GGE report (2015, without a vote, meaning by consensus). However, rather than constituting a centralised form of interpretation, the UN GA practice reflects the cumulative practice of individual States.\n---\n On the role of ‘judicial decisions’ as ‘subsidiary means, see Mads Andenas and Johann R Leiss, ‘The Systemic Relevance of “Judicial Decisions” in International Law’ (2017) 77 Zeitschrift für ausländisches öffentliches Recht und Völkerrecht 907, 934–935.\n Cf Christine Gray, ‘The Use and Abuse of the International Court of Justice: Cases concerning the Use of Force after Nicaragua’ (2003) 14 European Journal of International Law 867.

However, to date the UN Security Council has not taken up the issue. Moreover, UN Security Council resolutions do not represent an authoritative interpretation of the UN Charter that binds States beyond the individual case and often require further interpretation by the member States of the UN.\nThe ILC is another institution that potentially plays a role in clarifying (and even developing) the jus contra bellum in cyberspace. However, the suggestion to refer the issue to the ILC that was included in the initial pre-draft report of the OEWG was met by scepticism of several States. They consider it premature to involve the ILC at this stage, since the practice of States is as yet too scarce for the ILC to carry out a meaningful analysis.\nFor the future, however, it cannot be excluded that these actors will contribute to crystallisation of the ‘correct’ interpretation of the law. While their interpretation must (also) be grounded in the will of States, they will mainly process positive manifestations of those States that have actively made their position clear or, in the absence of a clearly identifiable common and consistent practice, have recourse to the objective means of interpretation.\n# 5. Conclusion\nThis article has discussed the politics and legal rationale behind the reluctance of some States to help clarify ‘how’ jus contra bellum applies in cyberspace. It has shown that interpretative silence may backfire in the long run. States’ silence may be interpreted – though only under strict conditions – as acquiescence to an emerging, widely accepted interpretation of the law. Moreover, objective factors beyond the subjective interpretation of States may come to the fore if too many States remain silent and thereby prevent the crystallisation of a sufficiently widely accepted interpretation of the law.\nIn light of these findings, initiatives that encourage States to make their positions publicly available are to be welcomed from a rule of law perspective. They are also in States’ own interests. The vital role of the jus contra bellum rules for the maintenance of peace and security requires interpretative clarity to ensure their efficiency and transparency.

Moreover, interpretation and development of the law would be left to military considerations that all too easily exclude other concerns.\nWhether these calls for more interpretative activity will make the UN OEWG process more successful than the UN GGE remains to be seen. It is more inclusive than the UN GGE and allows more States to be heard. However, the first impression does not seem very promising. The UN OEWG’s initial pre-draft and final report have not added anything substantive to the work of the UN GGE in matters of jus contra bellum in cyberspace.196\nIf the global dialogue on jus contra bellum in cyberspace remains unsuccessful, it seems likely that the path will steer away from global initiatives towards regional processes among like-minded states or even bilateral agreements.197 The US has already indicated that they would consider focusing on ‘likeminded partners’ to tackle cybersecurity issues.198 Likewise, Russia increasingly turns towards the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO).199 Other regional platforms are also becoming involved in cybersecurity issues, such as the Organization of American States, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Regional Forum, the Economic Community of West African States, the African Union, the European Union,200 the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe,201 and the Council of Europe.\nWhile the greater involvement of regional processes in the normative discourse is not a bad thing per se, the universal character of the UN Charter requires universal solutions to avoid ‘fragmentation of the international norms discourse’.202\n## Acknowledgment\nWork on this paper has been conducted under the aegis of the project ‘Security in Internet Governance and Networks: Analysing the Law’ (SIGNAL), funded by the Norwegian Research Council and UNINETT Norid AS.

Introduction": "Among the great challenges to international law posed by the digitisation of our modern world is the fact that modern warfare has expanded into cyberspace.¹ As with any technical developments in human history, warfare has taken up new digital technologies.² Modern armies have the capability to cause death and destruction via cyberspace.

These rules apply to cyberspace.¹¹ This is confirmed by numerous statements of States and by the outputs of the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing responsible State behaviour in cyberspace in the context of international security (‘UN GGE’)¹² and the United Nations Open-Ended Working Group on Developments in the Field of ICTs in the Context of International Security (‘UN OEWG’).¹³ The 2013 consensus report of the third UN GGE noted in general terms that international law and, in particular, the UN Charter applies in cyberspace.¹⁴ The following 2015 and 2021 reports of the fourth and sixth UN GGEs made clear that the UN Charter ‘applies in its entirety’.¹⁵\nHowever, there is still much uncertainty on exactly ‘how’ these rules apply.¹⁶ To give just\n4.

The UN GGE was established in 2002 by the UN Secretary-General at the request of the UN General Assembly, cf A/Res/56/19 (2002). Since 2004, six working groups have been convened, with the last one in 2019, cf 2004/2005 A/RES/58/32 (2003); 2009/2010 A/RES/60/45 (2006); 2012/2013 A/RES/66/24 (2011); 2014/2015 A/RES/68/243 (2014); 2016/2017 A/RES/70/237 (2015); 2019/2021 A/RES/73/266 (2019).

Up until recently, the UN GGE was the primary inter-state forum for discussions on the legal regulation of cyberspace, cf Anders Henriksen, ‘The End of the Road for the UN GGE Process: The Future Regulation of Cyberspace’ (2019) 5 (1) *Journal of Cybersecurity*, 1; Martha Finnemore and Kathryn Sikkink, ‘International Norm Dynamics and Political Change’ (1998) 52 *International Organ* 887.

What kind of activities constitute an ‘armed attack’ and might give a State cause to invoke its inherent right to self-defence (Article 51 UN Charter)?¹⁷ Where along the spectrum of permissible to impermissible conduct do various types of cyber-attacks lie? How is mere cyber-criminality to be distinguished from warfare? Should we apply the so-called ‘scale and effects’ test according to which a cyberoperation constitutes a ‘use of force’ if its scale and effects are comparable to the scale and effects of a ‘traditional’ use of kinetic force? How can we attribute use of force in cyberspace?¹⁸ More generally, how do we apply rules that are based on the existence of geographical borders, over which States exercise sovereignty, to cyberspace, in which such borders are far from distinct?¹⁹\nConsidering these open questions, it is all the more remarkable that many States shy away from actively contributing to the interpretative clarification of the law. They do not publish interpretative statements and do not make their practice of cyberwarfare public.\nPart 2 discusses the (in)activity of States to contribute to the interpretative clarification of ‘how’ jus contra bellum applies in cyberspace and discusses its negative repercussions for the work of the UN GGE and UN OEWG. Part 3 discusses possible explanations for the (legal) politics behind this interpretative silence. It argues that silence can be explained by a strategy of legal ambiguity, which finds its legal rationale in the traditional ‘freedom of State’ paradigm. The aim of this strategy is to keep the jus contra bellum in limbo and open scope for manoeuvre to cope with new technical developments and remaining strategic uncertainties in cyberwarfare.\nPart 4 discusses the (legal) consequences of interpretative silence and challenges its underlying rationale. The argument is that under the discursive framework provided by Articles 31–33 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (‘VCLT’)²⁰, the interpretation – or non-interpretation – of the parties to a treaty remains a central factor to be taken into account. However, it is only by actively contributing to the clarification of the law that States ensure their voice is heard and avoid the risk that their silence is interpreted as acquiescence. Moreover, contrary to what the freedom of State paradigm implies, the subjective interpretation of the parties is not the only ‘game in town’. Articles 31–32 VCLT and other factors complement the subjective dimension of interpretation with an objective one. The less the ‘authentic’ interpretation of the parties leads to interpretative clarification, the more the other modes of interpretation come to the fore. As such, legal ambiguity is a misnomer for the lack of centralised interpretative authority in international law. Part 5 concludes.\n---\n¹⁷ Cf Initial ‘pre-draft’ of the report of the UN OEWG <https: 03=\"\" 200311-pre-draft-oewg-ict.pdf=\"\" 2020=\"\" unoda-web.s3.amazonaws.com=\"\" wp-content=\"\" uploads=\"\" wp=\"\"> (‘UN OEWG pre-draft’) .

    "## 2. Interpretative silence and jus contra bellum in cyberspace": "### 2.1 Jus contra bellum in cyberspace – a question of UN Charter interpretation\nThe present article presumes that questions concerning the application of *jus contra bellum* to cyberspace are first and foremost a matter of UN Charter interpretation. In the author’s view, the UN Charter-based *jus contra bellum* norms and their customary corollaries have merged into a single norm,²¹ even though the customary manifestation is based in a different source, and insofar remains conceptually independent from its treaty corollary.²² Article 103 UN Charter, which attaches supremacy to UN Charter law over other international law, also applies to customary international law.²³ As such, customary derogation from the UN Charter based *jus contra bellum* is excluded.\nUnder what conditions an interpretation of UN Charter law amounts to a modification of the rules in question must not be conclusively discussed here. While further development of the Charter by consensual re-interpretation and customary application is possible,²⁴ for the present purpose it is sufficient to keep in mind that it is not easily to be presumed that States want to circumvent the strict requirements for Charter amendments (Articles 108 and 109 UN Charter).²⁵ There are, however, notable examples of informal UN Charter modification.²⁶\n### 2.2 Widespread interpretative silence\nConsidering the overall picture, we see that many States remain reluctant to clearly position themselves and contribute to a clarification of ‘how’ *jus contra bellum* applies in cyberspace.²⁷ An increasing number of States have published ‘cyber security strategies’,²⁸ and a growing number of States have also begun to publish statements on international law in cyberspace.²⁹\n---\n21.

It acknowledged the problem of attribution of cyberoperations and risk of potential threats, the ‘absence of a common understanding regarding acceptable State behaviour’, and more generally, the ‘lack of shared understanding regarding international norms pertaining to State use of ICTs’.⁴³ Furthermore, it noted that ‘[e]xisting agreements include norms relevant to the use of ICTs by States’, that ‘additional norms could be developed over time’, and that the dialogue should continue.⁴⁴\nIn 2011, a third group of experts (again 15 members) was set up.⁴⁵ This time the mandate of the group specifically asked not only for a discussion of ‘international concepts aimed at\n37.

As such, the report did not add much to the clarification of ‘how’ jus contra bellum applies in cyberspace.⁵⁶\nIn 2015, a fifth group of experts was established, again with an increased number of members (now 25).⁵⁷ This time, however, the discussions proved even more difficult than in the previous rounds. In June 2017, the experts failed to agree on a draft for a consensus report.⁵⁸ As previously mentioned, one explanation is that Cuba, China and Russia opposed the inclusion of references to the application of the right to self-defence (and the general international law principles of countermeasures and international humanitarian law).⁵⁹\n46. ibid.\n47.

The report reaffirmed that international law, in particular the UN Charter ‘in its entirety’, applies in cyberspace (explicitly including the prohibition on the use of force) and noted again ‘the inherent right of States to take measures consistent with international law and as recognized in the Charter’.⁶²\nWhether the UN OEWG, as a more inclusive platform, will be more successful in clarifying the law remains to be seen. So far, the outcomes of the UN OEWG process have been rather limited. They do not go beyond the findings of the UN GGE.⁶³ In its initial pre-draft from April 2020⁶⁴ and in its final substantive report from 10 March 2021,⁶⁵ the UN OEWG noted that States reaffirmed the application of international law, and in particular UN Charter law, to cyberspace.\nIt would go too far to claim that the unwillingness of some States to publish their interpretations and to stay silent is the only reason for the failure of the UN GGE and the UN OEWG to provide more interpretative clarity. Interpretative activity may also lead to disagreement. However, interpretative engagement could have at least paved the way for finding common ground. This is also supported by the recommendations of the UN OEWG pre-draft and final reports, which emphasise the need for further information on the views and practice of States in relation to ‘how’ international law applies in cyberspace.⁶⁶",
    "# 3. The (legal) politics of silence": "How can we explain the reluctance of States to refrain from submitting their legal positions on the interpretation of the jus contra bellum in cyberspace and the preference of some to foster new law-making instead of clarifying existing law? As States rarely explain the reasons for their silence, we can only speculate on their motives. A convincing explanation is that their choice for inactivity is driven by a preference for legal ambiguity, which finds its legal rationale in the traditional ‘freedom of State’ paradigm.\nThe discussion on the regulation of cyberwarfare is not only about the correct interpretation of the law but it ‘is as much about strategy, politics and ideological differences’.⁶⁷ The interpretative approaches chosen by States often reflect their broader strategical interests, which coincide with their economic, military and technical capacities.⁶⁸ Historically this has always been the case; the new reality of cyberwarfare has not changed this. How States interpret jus contra bellum in cyberspace is not independent of their respective ICT strengths and\n⁶⁰. A/RES/73/266 (2019).\n⁶¹. A/76/135 (2021).\n⁶². ibid  and [71(d)].\n⁶³.

One possible explanation is that States wait for further technical developments before they formulate their own interpretative approaches. The speed and unpredictability of the development of new digital technologies create enormous strategic uncertainties.⁷¹ While economical resources and technical capacities are also of great importance in the context of cyberwarfare, the open structure of cyberspace seems to have re-shuffled many of the old certainties. Small States with a limited budget and little conventional military power can conduct military measures which have a large-scale effect in almost every corner of the world. Despite their strong conventional military powers, traditional strong military and economic powers feel increasingly vulnerable due to their strong digital connectedness. Against the background of these strategic uncertainties, it seems to be – at least at first glance – a rational choice for States to aim at paralysing legal clarification and perpetuating legal uncertainty, as they cannot sufficiently predict the long-term consequences of their own legal interpretation.⁷²\nFrom a legal-theoretical perspective, this choice of strategic ambiguity can only be explained by the traditional so-called ‘freedom of State’ paradigm. This state-oriented and subjective perspective paradigm considers the freedom and the will of States paramount. It found its most famous manifestation in the Lotus dictum of the Permanent Court of International Justice in 1927. The court held that\ninternational law governs relations between independent States. The rules of law binding upon States therefore emanate from their own free will as expressed in conventions or by usage generally accepted as expressing principles of law and established in order to regulate the relations between these co-existing independent communities or with a view to the achievement of common aims. Restrictions on the independence of States cannot therefore presumed.⁷³\nFrom this perspective, States are only bound by the extent to which they have consented to the rule of international law. Not only the formation of rules, but also their interpretation, follows this paradigm. In an earlier judgment, the PCIJ stated in relation to the interpretation of international law that ‘it is an established principle that the right of giving an authoritative interpretation of a legal rule belongs solely to the person or body who has power to modify or suppress it’.⁷⁴ From this point of view, the freedom of State remains the residual rule. Indeterminacy plays into the hand of States.

If States remain silent, they remain free to do what they want.75\nAlternative explanations for interpretative silence do not convince. Disinterest in the topic seems a rather unlikely explanation, given the great relevance of cyber security in contemporary politics. Disagreement among different branches of the government is another possible explanation.76 However, this author is not aware of any such conflicts between different branches of the government within silent States. Coercion of less powerful States to remain silent due to certain power structures and dependencies in international politics (eg of military or economic nature) may also explain their silence. However, the author is not aware of any concrete cases. A final explanation could be that some States have voiced scepticism against the UN GGE. For example, Russia has referred to the UN GGE as ‘a narrow’ and ‘elitist’ expert platform and criticised the report of the UN OEWG for its linkage to the findings of the UN GGE.77 However, this attitude does not explain a general reluctance of States to position themselves outside of the UN GGE context, for example in the more inclusive forum of the UN OEWG.",
    "## 4. The (legal) consequence of interpretative silence": "## 4.1 States’ interpretation as ‘subsequent practice’\nTo start with the obvious: no State alone can determine the law with a binding effect for itself or for others by positively interpreting it or by not interpreting it. As Weiler and Haltern have argued, ‘autointerpretation, by each state individually, is mostly accepted as a practical inevitability with little, if any, normative value’.78 While States are usually the first and often also the last interpreters of the law (in the absence of delegation of interpretative authority, for example to an international court), it is wrong to claim that ‘each State establishes for itself its legal situation vis-à-vis other States’.79 To state otherwise would go against one of the cornerstones of the international legal order: the equality of States.80 Just as a single State\n75.

These rules also apply to the UN Charter which was concluded before the VCLT entered into force. The formulation of Article 31(3) VCLT indicates that an agreement between all the parties to a treaty is required as it speaks of a ‘subsequent agreement between the parties’ (lit a) or a ‘subsequent practice …which establishes the agreement of the parties’ (lit b). Only an ‘agreement’ constitutes the ‘authentic’ interpretation of the parties to a treaty, which ‘constitutes objective evidence of the understanding of the parties as to the meaning of the treaty’. Subsequent interpretation by one or few parties or conflicting interpretations of different parties do not establish an ‘agreement’. It may only be relevant as ‘supplementary’ means of interpretation even if not all conditions of Article 31(3)(a) or (b) are fulfilled (cf Article 32 VLCT). However, such practice carries considerably less weight. It only serves as a supporting argument for an interpretation that has been reached by other means.\n## 4.2 Silence as acquiescence\nAgainst this background, what is the legal consequence of State’s interpretative silence? Does it matter that some States publish statements on the interpretation of the *jus contra bellum* in cyberspace whereas others refrain from doing so? Does the strategic inactivity leave the law in limbo?\n81.

As a general rule, an ‘agreement’ in the sense of Article 31(3)(a) or (b) must be ‘established’ and therefore it must be positively identifiable.⁹¹ A ‘subsequent agreement’ (lit a) must be clearly manifested (though not necessarily in written form) and *ipso facto* constitutes an ‘authentic interpretation’.⁹² For ‘subsequent practice’ (lit b), it must be shown that the understanding is common to the parties of the treaties by evincing a ‘particular conduct or circumstances’ through which an agreement can be identified indirectly.⁹³ Therefore, ‘a subsequent agreement’ is typically easier to prove than a ‘subsequent practice’.⁹⁴\nA strict threshold of how many States must actively engage in a subsequent practice under lit b is difficult to establish.⁹⁵ As a general rule, the value of the subsequent practice ‘depends on the extent to which it is concordant, common and consistent’.⁹⁶ Here we can draw a parallel to the requirements of customary international law. ‘Subsequent practice’ under Article 31(3)(b) VCLT in essences equals practice under Article 38(1)(b) of the Statute of the International Court of Justice (ICJ Statute)⁹⁷.⁹⁸ The main difference is that, in the context of treaty interpretation, a ‘specific’ practice of the parties to the treaty rather than a ‘general’ practice is required.⁹⁹ The ICJ made clear that the practice of States (accompanied by the required *opinio juris*) needs to be sufficiently general for formation of a rule of customary international law.¹⁰⁰ It must be ‘extensive’,¹⁰¹ ‘sufficiently widespread’¹⁰² and ‘broadly representative’,¹⁰³ in particular by those States whose interests are ‘specially affected’.¹⁰⁴ This means that it is not required to prove a positive practice of all parties at all times.¹⁰⁵ There is no strict standard on the exact number of States’ practices that must be positively proven.¹⁰⁶\n⁹¹.

Other States may have done nothing, but find themselves bound by the emerging rule’.¹⁰⁸\nFrom this follows that relevant silence may be considered a confirmation of the developing interpretative ‘agreement’.¹⁰⁹ Under what circumstance it does so, however, remains a much-contested issue in international legal practice and scholarship.¹¹⁰\nThe first question is: what kind of behaviour qualifies as silence? A clear case of silence is given if a State does not express itself at all in relation to the interpretation of a treaty and any of its provisions. Such behaviour qualifies as a verbal omission and therefore silence.¹¹¹ Generally, statements on the non-application of a treaty or a rule may qualify as relevant ‘subsequent practice’ and do not constitute silence.¹¹² A sufficient detailedness of the interpretative statement is not required. Inconsistent subsequent practice can be precluded from having a normative effect under the principle of estoppel.¹¹³ Hence, claims by some States that Article 51 UN Charter does not apply in cyberspace are devoid of normative effect, if these States have earlier acknowledged that the UN Charter applies in cyberspace.\nThe second question is whether the State’s intention to confirm a certain interpretation through its silence is decisive or whether we should apply objective criteria and rely on the recipient’s perspective.¹¹⁴ In a nutshell, voluntarists argue that States’ silence only has the legal effect that conforms to the will of the silent State.¹¹⁵ For those who support an objective\n107.

Attaching legal effect to States’ silence is a compensation for the ‘soft’ character of this ‘legislative responsibility’.¹²¹ In Starski’s view, such responsibility follows inter alia from a ‘constitutionalist’ reading of international law.¹²² In her view, the ‘eminent’ role of States in the process of law creation and evolution ‘endows states with a specific responsibility towards the effectivity of the international legal system’ which depends on a clarification of the law.¹²³ Only determinacy makes norms operational and allows us to distinguish law from non-law.¹²⁴\nStarski’s argument has merits for several reasons. To start with, the principle of good faith reflected in Article 31(1) VCLT requires States to fulfil their obligation as parties to a treaty, not to impede the effect of the treaty by perpetuating indeterminacy (under certain circumstances, as discussed below).¹²⁵\nWhile a ‘constitutionalist’ reading of international law invoked by Starski comes with challenges,¹²⁶ the ‘legislative responsibility takes account of the shift from a purely State-oriented international legal order of co-existence towards a legal order of cooperation that does not only serve States’ interests but also interests of an alleged ‘international commu\nGeneral Principles and Sources of Law’ (1953) 30 British Year Book of International Law 1, 68; Jacques Bentz, ‘Le silence comme manifestation de volonté en Droit international public’ (1963) 67 Revue Général de Droit International Public 44, 45.\n116.

As the ILC noted, ‘acceptance of a practice by one or more parties by way of silence or inaction is not easily established’.¹²⁹ In order to find a fair balance between the objectification of silence and consensualist concerns, a close scrutiny of the context and setting of the silence is required.¹³⁰ The important qualification is that we can infer consent from silence only – independent of the real intention of the State – if the ‘circumstances were such as called for some reaction’.¹³¹ Only if she must and can speak (*si loqui debuisset ac potuisset*), the neutral maxim that ‘she who keeps silent is held neither to deny nor to accept’ (*qui tacit neque negat, neque utique fatetur*) yields to the maxim that ‘she who keeps silent is held to consent’ (*qui tacit consentire videtur*).¹³²\nThe ILC has pointed to two factors that must be considered to establish whether the circumstances ‘called for some reaction’: ‘the legal situation to which the subsequent practice by the other party relates and the claim thereby expressed’.¹³³ If we break down these two broad criteria into more specific sub-criteria, we can identify nine factors that should be taken into account.¹³⁴\nThe first factor that should be considered is the nature of the State practice itself.¹³⁵ It is relevant whether the interpretative action was a singular event or whether it occurred frequently.¹³⁶ Moreover, it is relevant whether the interpretative action is consistent and whether it has become commonplace.¹³⁷ In this context, the element of time must also be considered: the longer States engage in a certain action, the higher the expectation is that other States react.¹³⁸\n127.

As Starski convincingly argues,\n[t]he very purpose of erga omnes norms would appear to be undermined if the non-protest of bystander states in light of their violation might more easily have a law-altering effect than in the case of ‘ordinary’ rules. ... The erga omnes dimension of norms creates a – rather fictitious – locus standi, but only to the benefit of a norm’s enforceability and not in order to enhance its alterability.¹⁵⁴\nThe eighth factor to be considered is ‘timeliness’.¹⁵⁵ The greater the impact of the proposed interpretation is on interests and rights of a State, the more it is to be expected that it responds in a timely manner.¹⁵⁶\nThe ninth and final factor concerns the nature of the affected rules in question.¹⁵⁷ If the rule in question enjoys a jus cogens or erga omnes status, the threshold for modification is set high. Jus cogens norms require a near-universal State practice and can only be substituted by a norm of the same nature (Article 53 VCLT). As such, silence ‘can only under very limited circumstances issue law formative effects in cases in which peremptory norms are at stake if the very concept of jus cogens is to be kept doctrinally intact’.¹⁵⁸\nIf we apply these standards to the practice of States to the discourse on jus contra bellum in cyberspace, it seems premature to conclude that the silence of States that have not engaged with interpretative proposals made by other States amounts to acquiescence in all contexts.\nTo give one illustrative example: many of those States that have published interpretative statements have endorsed the so-called ‘scale and effects’ test (or a version thereof)¹⁵⁹ that is based on the Nicaragua judgment of the ICJ.¹⁶⁰ Under the ‘scale and effects’ test, a cyber-operation constitutes a ‘use of force’ if its scale and effects are comparable to the scale and effects of a ‘traditional’ use of kinetic force.¹⁶¹\nDoes the silence of some States on whether they agree with this interpretation of the law amount to legally relevant acquiescence? Were the circumstances such that they called for some reaction according to the aforementioned standards?\nSeveral of those standards are met. Mere verbal and written statements may constitute relevant ‘subsequent practice’. Article 31(3)(b) VCLT does not require a physical action as\n(commentaries on Articles 48(1)(a) and 48(1)(b)).

The silent States had the capacity to act and were (or at least ought to be) aware of these interpretative statements (third factor). The statements were made in internationally significant contexts, such as before the UN GGE and UN OEWG, or through official channels, including homepages of ministries of foreign affairs, or other public fora (fourth factor). The jus contra bellum also consists of rules that are by their very nature volatile (fifth factor).\nHowever, if we look at the other relevant factors, it seems doubtful that the circumstances were already such that they called for some reaction. Arguably, the interpretative statements in relation to the ‘scale’ and ‘effect’ test are not sufficiently consistent and widespread (first factor). While there seems to be an agreement on the overall contours of this test and its applicability in cyberspace, there still seems disagreement on its precise scope, for example in relation to the question of whether cyber-operations causing severe non-physical consequences, such as an attack on the nation’s economic system, may also reach the threshold of a use of force. Several States seem to be in favour of this interpretation.¹⁶³ Others, however, seem to be sceptical or leave this question open.¹⁶⁴ It also seems doubtful that a sufficient number of States have publicly subscribed to an application of this test. The subsequent practice must be ‘extensive’¹⁶⁵ and ‘sufficiently widespread’¹⁶⁶ and ‘broadly representative’¹⁶⁷ among States, in particular those whose interests are ‘specially affected’.¹⁶⁸ While the number of States supporting this test is relatively large and seems to be growing, it does not comprise the majority of UN Member States yet. However, it is not unlikely that the relevant threshold will be met in the future, which would increase the expectation of reactions of bystanders.\nMoreover, most States who have begun to position themselves in favour of an application of the ‘scale’ and ‘effect’ in cyberspace test have done so only quite recently (first and eighth factor). The UN OEWG process, in whose context many States have made their statements, has also been only established relatively recently. However, the longer the UN OEWG process is ongoing, the higher the expectation is that other States react to interpretative proposals.\nAs the interpretative proposals relate to the UN Charter and potentially impact rights and interests of all States, one could argue that a reaction can be expected (sixth factor). On the other hand, as has been discussed above, the fact that the UN Charter jus contra bellum rules constitute erga omnes obligations and jus cogens¹⁶⁹ speaks against inferring too easily\n162.

If the rule in question enjoys a *jus cogens* or *erga omnes* status, the threshold for a conclusive interpretation is set very high.\nIn conclusion, good arguments speak in favour of not (yet) qualifying the silence as acquiescence to interpretations that support the ‘scale’ and ‘effect’ test. However, these findings are only a snapshot of the current situation. The more a common position crystallises among a sufficient number of states on the interpretation of the *jus contra bellum* in cyberspace (or specific elements thereof), the more that silent States need to position themselves to avoid their silence being interpreted as acquiescence.\nMoreover, as discussed in the next section, the lack of an interpretative agreement on the ‘scale’ and ‘effect’ test does not necessarily leave the law in limbo as objective interpretative factors must also be considered. International lawyers are justified in making an argument in favour of applying the ‘scale’ and ‘effect’ test to cyberspace on the basis of the wording, objective and purpose of the UN Charter, in light of ICJ jurisprudence (Article 38(1)(d) ICJ Statute).\n## 4.3 The interplay between subjective and objective factors in UN Charter interpretation\nContrary to what the freedom of State paradigm implies, the subjective interpretation of the parties of ‘how’ the UN Charter *jus contra bellum* applies in cyberspace is not the sole factor at play. The subjective interpretation of States is complemented by objective factors, including the ‘ordinary meaning’ of the terms of the treaty (Article 31(1) VCLT), the treaty’s ‘context’ and ‘object and purpose’ (Article 31(1) VCLT), agreements and instruments made with the conclusion of the treaty (Article 31(2) VCLT), and other ‘relevant rules of international law applicable in relations between the parties’ (Article 31(3)(c) VCLT). In treaty interpretation, subjective and objective factors do not stand in a hierarchical relationship with each other; their order merely represents the logical process of interpretation.¹⁷⁰ Subsequent practice is often used in interplay with the other means of interpretation in a ‘single combined operation’.¹⁷¹ At least, this observation holds true with regard to the practice of the ICJ.¹⁷²\nThe complementary interplay of subjective and objective elements in the interpretation of treaties that follows from Article 31 VLCT takes account of the shift from a purely State-oriented international legal order of co-existence towards a legal order of cooperation that has been discussed above.¹⁷³ While the traditional bilateral structure remains the basis to avoid international law sliding into utopianism, treaties have a normative force that is independent from States’ will.¹⁷⁴\n---\n¹⁷⁰.

On community interests, see Simma (n 128) 230.\nJOHANN RUBEN LEISS\nExclusive reliance on the will of States in treaty interpretation would easily lead to gaps in the law if States do not develop a common understanding. In such circumstances, a non-liquet would have to be declared.¹⁷⁵ It would not be possible to determine the meaning of a provision.\nWhile it would go beyond the scope of the present paper to comprehensively discuss the possibility of gaps in the law, a few remarks should suffice. Although we find instances where courts have accepted a non-liquet,¹⁷⁶ judicial practice and scholarship are generally not willing to do so.¹⁷⁷ International rules are per se shrouded by uncertainty and indeterminacy (as any legal rules).¹⁷⁸ Allowing non-liquet would question the very functionality and effectiveness of international law. The judicial function of judges requires that they concretise norms and provide definite answers to legal questions.¹⁷⁹ The plurality of subjective and objective interpretative tools offered by Articles 31–32 VCLT strongly support the view that non-liquet should not be assumed. Important in this context is Article 31(3)(1) VCLT, which provides a pathway of general principles of international law into every interpretative exercise. General principles’ main function is filling gaps in the law, that is, to avoid lacunae left by the (application of the) other sources of international law.¹⁸⁰\nWhile the strategic inactivity of many States to publish their practice undoubtedly has negative consequences for the clarification of the jus contra bellum, it does not leave the law in limbo. The law stands despite the relative lack of States’ contribution to its clarification. Even if States establish a subsequent interpretative agreement in the sense of Article 31(1)(a) or (b) VCLT, such an agreement is only one factor among others that must be considered.\n## 4.5 The role of courts, organs of international organisations and the ILC and the lack of centralised interpretative authority\nAgainst this background, legal ambiguity in the present context is not the consequence of a gap in the law that follows from the interpretative silence of states; rather, it is a misnomer for the lack of centralised interpretative authority in international law. States are not the only relevant actors in the interpretation of international law. A number of institutional actors could potentially play an important role in the normative discourse on ‘how’ jus contra bellum applies in cyberspace, such as international courts and tribunals, organs of international organisations (most importantly UN organs), and the International Law Commission (ILC). However, none of these institutional actors has been equipped with the centralised authority to decide what the correct interpretation of the law is. As such, the clarification of the law is left to an open-ended discursive process.\n---\n¹⁷⁵. *Non liquet* transl. ‘it is not clear’.\n¹⁷⁶.

Even though the ICJ had for a while a considerable number of cases (directly or indirectly) concerning the use of force before it,¹⁸² this trend has not continued, and most of the cases did not make it to the merits.¹⁸³ Importantly for us, the Court has not dealt with questions concerning *jus contra bellum* in cyberspace and it is not likely that it will do so in the near future; other courts or tribunals that may take up the issues are also not in sight.\nWhile the UN GGE played a significant role as a facilitator of normative discourse, it has never been a platform that could have authoritatively determined the correct interpretation of the *jus contra bellum*. The UN GGE was not invested with the power to create new international law.¹⁸⁴ The reports of the UN GGE do not set legal norms themselves. Even if one supports the view that the practice of organs or sub-organs of international organisations may be directly relevant under Article 31–32 VCLT,¹⁸⁵ for example as relevant ‘subsequent practice’, good arguments speak against attaching significant weight to the practice of the UN GGE. The reports only represent the views of experts of a limited number of States (initially 15, now 25). What matters is the reception by all parties to the UN Charter and other international organs of the UN, such as the UN GA.\nThe UN GA may take up issues on *jus contra bellum* in cyberspace and has done so, for example by ‘taking note’ of the assessments and recommendations of the two first UN GGE reports (2010 and 2013) and by ‘welcoming’ the ‘conclusions’ of the third UN GGE report (2015, without a vote, meaning by consensus).¹⁸⁶ However, rather than constituting a centralised form of interpretation, the UN GA practice reflects the cumulative practice of individual States.¹⁸⁷\n---\n¹⁸¹ On the role of ‘judicial decisions’ as ‘subsidiary means, see Mads Andenas and Johann R Leiss, ‘The Systemic Relevance of “Judicial Decisions” in International Law’ (2017) 77 Zeitschrift für ausländisches öffentliches Recht und Völkerrecht 907, 934–935.\n¹⁸² Cf Christine Gray, ‘The Use and Abuse of the International Court of Justice: Cases concerning the Use of Force after Nicaragua’ (2003) 14 European Journal of International Law 867.

They consider it premature to involve the ILC at this stage, since the practice of States is as yet too scarce for the ILC to carry out a meaningful analysis.¹⁹³\nFor the future, however, it cannot be excluded that these actors will contribute to crystallisation of the ‘correct’ interpretation of the law. While their interpretation must (also) be grounded in the will of States, they will mainly process positive manifestations of those States that have actively made their position clear or, in the absence of a clearly identifiable common and consistent practice, have recourse to the objective means of interpretation.",
    "# 5. Conclusion": "This article has discussed the politics and legal rationale behind the reluctance of some States to help clarify ‘how’ jus contra bellum applies in cyberspace. It has shown that interpretative silence may backfire in the long run. States’ silence may be interpreted – though only under strict conditions – as acquiescence to an emerging, widely accepted interpretation of the law. Moreover, objective factors beyond the subjective interpretation of States may come to the fore if too many States remain silent and thereby prevent the crystallisation of a sufficiently widely accepted interpretation of the law.\nIn light of these findings, initiatives that encourage States to make their positions publicly available are to be welcomed from a rule of law perspective.¹⁹⁴ They are also in States’ own interests. The vital role of the jus contra bellum rules for the maintenance of peace and security requires interpretative clarity to ensure their efficiency and transparency.

Moreover, interpretation and development of the law would be left to military considerations that all too easily exclude other concerns.\nWhether these calls for more interpretative activity will make the UN OEWG process more successful than the UN GGE remains to be seen. It is more inclusive than the UN GGE and allows more States to be heard. However, the first impression does not seem very promising. The UN OEWG’s initial pre-draft and final report have not added anything substantive to the work of the UN GGE in matters of jus contra bellum in cyberspace.196\nIf the global dialogue on jus contra bellum in cyberspace remains unsuccessful, it seems likely that the path will steer away from global initiatives towards regional processes among like-minded states or even bilateral agreements.197 The US has already indicated that they would consider focusing on ‘likeminded partners’ to tackle cybersecurity issues.198 Likewise, Russia increasingly turns towards the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO).199 Other regional platforms are also becoming involved in cybersecurity issues, such as the Organization of American States, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Regional Forum, the Economic Community of West African States, the African Union, the European Union,200 the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe,201 and the Council of Europe.\nWhile the greater involvement of regional processes in the normative discourse is not a bad thing per se, the universal character of the UN Charter requires universal solutions to avoid ‘fragmentation of the international norms discourse’.202\n## Acknowledgment\nWork on this paper has been conducted under the aegis of the project ‘Security in Internet Governance and Networks: Analysing the Law’ (SIGNAL), funded by the Norwegian Research Council and UNINETT Norid AS.

(EUI), Associate Professor, Inland Norway University of Applied Science (Lillehammer) and Associate Professor II, University of Oslo\njohann.leiss@inn.no\n## Abstract\nThis article explores the (in)activity of many States in contributing to the interpretative clarification of 'how' jus contra bellum applies in cyberspace, its negative repercussions for the work of the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing responsible State behaviour in cyberspace in the context of international security (UN GGE) and the United Nations Open-Ended Working Group on Developments in the Field of ICTs in the Context of International Security (UN OEWG), and the way forward. In its main part, the article analyses the (legal) consequences of interpretative silence and challenges its (presumably) underlying rationale – that is, a strategy of legal ambiguity based on the traditional 'freedom of State' paradigm. This article argues that it is only by actively contributing to the clarification of the law that States ensure their voice is heard and avoid the risk that their silence is interpreted as acquiescence. Moreover, contrary to what the freedom of State paradigm implies, the subjective interpretation of the parties is not the only 'game in town'. If no interpretative agreement of States crystallises, the interpretation of jus contra bellum is determined by objective factors. The article concludes by arguing that from a rule of law perspective, States should be encouraged to express their views on 'how' jus contra bellum applies in cyberspace to ensure the efficiency and transparency of these rules, which constitute part of the backbone of a peaceful co-existence and cooperation between states.\n## Keywords\njus contra bellum, cyberwarfare, treaty interpretation, acquiescence, UN GGE, UN OEWG\n## 1. Introduction\nAmong the great challenges to international law posed by the digitisation of our modern world is the fact that modern warfare has expanded into cyberspace. As with any technical developments in human history, warfare has taken up new digital technologies. Modern armies have the capability to cause death and destruction via cyberspace. At the same time, societies have become increasingly vulnerable. Much critical infrastructure is digitalised,\n1. On the term ‘cyberspace’, see François Delerue, *Cyber Operations and International Law* (CUP 2020) 10–13, 29.\n2.

Cyber-operations may, as Roscini writes, ‘disable power generators, cut off the military command, control, and communication systems, cause trains to derail and aeroplanes to crash, nuclear reactors to melt down, pipelines to explode, weapons to malfunction, banking systems to cripple’. The possible modes of ‘cyberwarfare’ range from small-scale operations – some sort of web vandalism – to severe attacks on critical infrastructure. Geographical distance and time become less relevant; any target can be hit within seconds from any place in the world that has an internet connection.\nThe fundamental question of whether the law on the use of force (the *jus ad bellum*; or in modern parlance *jus contra bellum*) as enshrined in Articles 2(4) and 51 of the Charter of the United Nations (‘UN Charter’) and in their customary equivalents apply to cyberspace seems to have been settled by now. These rules apply to cyberspace. This is confirmed by numerous statements of States and by the outputs of the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing responsible State behaviour in cyberspace in the context of international security (‘UN GGE’) and the United Nations Open-Ended Working Group on Developments in the Field of ICTs in the Context of International Security (‘UN OEWG’). The 2013 consensus report of the third UN GGE noted in general terms that international law and, in particular, the UN Charter applies in cyberspace. The following 2015 and 2021 reports of the fourth and sixth UN GGEs made clear that the UN Charter ‘applies in its entirety’.\nHowever, there is still much uncertainty on exactly ‘how’ these rules apply. To give just\n4. Roscini, *Cyber Operations and the Use of Force* (n 2) 1–2; and already in Roscini, ‘World Wide Warfare’ (n 3) 86–87.\n5.

Since 2004, six working groups have been convened, with the last one in 2019, cf 2004/2005 A/RES/58/32 (2003); 2009/2010 A/RES/60/45 (2006); 2012/2013 A/RES/66/24 (2011); 2014/2015 A/RES/68/243 (2014); 2016/2017 A/RES/70/237 (2015); 2019/2021 A/RES/73/266 (2019). The UN GGE reports to the UN General Assembly. The UN General Assembly considered and endorsed – by consensus – the 2010, 2013 and 2015 UN GGE reports, cf A/RES/65/41 (2011); A/RES/68/243 (2014); A/RES/70/237 (2015). Up until recently, the UN GGE was the primary inter-state forum for discussions on the legal regulation of cyberspace, cf Anders Henriksen, ‘The End of the Road for the UN GGE Process: The Future Regulation of Cyberspace’ (2019) 5 (1) *Journal of Cybersecurity*, 1; Martha Finnemore and Kathryn Sikkink, ‘International Norm Dynamics and Political Change’ (1998) 52 *International Organ* 887.

What kind of activities constitute an ‘armed attack’ and might give a State cause to invoke its inherent right to self-defence (Article 51 UN Charter)? Where along the spectrum of permissible to impermissible conduct do various types of cyber-attacks lie? How is mere cyber-criminality to be distinguished from warfare? Should we apply the so-called ‘scale and effects’ test according to which a cyberoperation constitutes a ‘use of force’ if its scale and effects are comparable to the scale and effects of a ‘traditional’ use of kinetic force? How can we attribute use of force in cyberspace? More generally, how do we apply rules that are based on the existence of geographical borders, over which States exercise sovereignty, to cyberspace, in which such borders are far from distinct?\nConsidering these open questions, it is all the more remarkable that many States shy away from actively contributing to the interpretative clarification of the law. They do not publish interpretative statements and do not make their practice of cyberwarfare public.\nPart 2 discusses the (in)activity of States to contribute to the interpretative clarification of ‘how’ jus contra bellum applies in cyberspace and discusses its negative repercussions for the work of the UN GGE and UN OEWG. Part 3 discusses possible explanations for the (legal) politics behind this interpretative silence. It argues that silence can be explained by a strategy of legal ambiguity, which finds its legal rationale in the traditional ‘freedom of State’ paradigm. The aim of this strategy is to keep the jus contra bellum in limbo and open scope for manoeuvre to cope with new technical developments and remaining strategic uncertainties in cyberwarfare.\nPart 4 discusses the (legal) consequences of interpretative silence and challenges its underlying rationale. The argument is that under the discursive framework provided by Articles 31–33 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (‘VCLT’), the interpretation – or non-interpretation – of the parties to a treaty remains a central factor to be taken into account. However, it is only by actively contributing to the clarification of the law that States ensure their voice is heard and avoid the risk that their silence is interpreted as acquiescence. Moreover, contrary to what the freedom of State paradigm implies, the subjective interpretation of the parties is not the only ‘game in town’. Articles 31–32 VCLT and other factors complement the subjective dimension of interpretation with an objective one. The less the ‘authentic’ interpretation of the parties leads to interpretative clarification, the more the other modes of interpretation come to the fore. As such, legal ambiguity is a misnomer for the lack of centralised interpretative authority in international law. Part 5 concludes.\n---\n Cf Initial ‘pre-draft’ of the report of the UN OEWG <https: 03=\"\" 200311-pre-draft-oewg-ict.pdf=\"\" 2020=\"\" unoda-web.s3.amazonaws.com=\"\" wp-content=\"\" uploads=\"\" wp=\"\"> (‘UN OEWG pre-draft’) [27].

Interpretative silence and jus contra bellum in cyberspace\n### 2.1 Jus contra bellum in cyberspace – a question of UN Charter interpretation\nThe present article presumes that questions concerning the application of *jus contra bellum* to cyberspace are first and foremost a matter of UN Charter interpretation. In the author’s view, the UN Charter-based *jus contra bellum* norms and their customary corollaries have merged into a single norm, even though the customary manifestation is based in a different source, and insofar remains conceptually independent from its treaty corollary. Article 103 UN Charter, which attaches supremacy to UN Charter law over other international law, also applies to customary international law. As such, customary derogation from the UN Charter based *jus contra bellum* is excluded.\nUnder what conditions an interpretation of UN Charter law amounts to a modification of the rules in question must not be conclusively discussed here. While further development of the Charter by consensual re-interpretation and customary application is possible, for the present purpose it is sufficient to keep in mind that it is not easily to be presumed that States want to circumvent the strict requirements for Charter amendments (Articles 108 and 109 UN Charter). There are, however, notable examples of informal UN Charter modification.\n### 2.2 Widespread interpretative silence\nConsidering the overall picture, we see that many States remain reluctant to clearly position themselves and contribute to a clarification of ‘how’ *jus contra bellum* applies in cyberspace. An increasing number of States have published ‘cyber security strategies’, and a growing number of States have also begun to publish statements on international law in cyberspace.\n---\n21.

However, some States continue to question whether the UN Charter provides a sufficient regulatory framework and whether Article 51 UN Charter (self-defence) also applies in cyberspace – despite the rather clear formulation in the 2013 and 2021 reports of the UN GGE that the UN Charter ‘applies in its entirety’. For example, Russia, China and Cuba reportedly opposed an explicit reference to the right to self-defence in the 2017 UN GGE report, which seems to have been a principal reason for the group’s failure to deliver a consensus report.

As such, Russia is a fierce advocate of a new international legal regime for cyberwarfare.\n## 2.3 The limited success of the UN GGE and UN OEWG\nThe UN GGE’s process has hitherto failed to contribute much to the clarification of ‘how’ *jus contra bellum* applies in cyberspace beyond the acknowledgment that the UN Charter applies ‘in its entirety’. Good arguments speak in favour of assuming that this failure is – at least to a certain extent – a consequence of the remaining unwillingness of many States to clarify their interpretative positions.\nAfter the failure of the first UN GGE (15 members) to deliver a final report, it was commonly agreed that the topic required further discussion. The second group of experts (again 15 members) eventually managed to reach an agreement on a short 2010 consensus report. However, this report only contained a few rudimentary findings and recommendations. It acknowledged the problem of attribution of cyberoperations and risk of potential threats, the ‘absence of a common understanding regarding acceptable State behaviour’, and more generally, the ‘lack of shared understanding regarding international norms pertaining to State use of ICTs’. Furthermore, it noted that ‘[e]xisting agreements include norms relevant to the use of ICTs by States’, that ‘additional norms could be developed over time’, and that the dialogue should continue.\nIn 2011, a third group of experts (again 15 members) was set up.

The third group submitted in 2013 a consensus report reemphasising the findings of the previous report. Importantly, the report noted for the first time explicitly that international law and in particular the UN Charter apply in cyberspace.\nIn December 2013, a fourth group of governmental experts was established, with their number increased to 20 members. The mandate of the fourth group included now specifically the question of ‘how’ international law applies in cyberspace. In 2015, the fourth group elaborated on some of the findings of the two previous UN GGE reports in a new consensus report. The group went further than the previous report by not only affirming in general terms that the UN Charter applies, but by explicitly noting that it ‘applies in its entirety’ and that States have an ‘inherent right …to take measures consistent with international law and as recognized in the Charter’. Moreover, it included explicit references to ‘the principles of humanity, necessity, proportionality and distinction’ and the obligation on States not to ‘use proxies to commit internationally wrongful acts using ICTs’ and to ‘ensure that their territory is not used by non-State actors to commit such acts’. Again, however, the report did not go into further detail and noted that there was a ‘need for further study on this matter’. In addition, the report included ‘recommendations for consideration by States for voluntary, non-binding norms, rules or principles of responsible behaviour of States aimed at promoting an open, secure, stable, accessible and peaceful ICT environment’. Many of these non-binding norms simply resemble what is already codified in international law as binding norms. As such, the report did not add much to the clarification of ‘how’ jus contra bellum applies in cyberspace.\nIn 2015, a fifth group of experts was established, again with an increased number of members (now 25). This time, however, the discussions proved even more difficult than in the previous rounds. In June 2017, the experts failed to agree on a draft for a consensus report. As previously mentioned, one explanation is that Cuba, China and Russia opposed the inclusion of references to the application of the right to self-defence (and the general international law principles of countermeasures and international humanitarian law).\n46. ibid.\n47.

The group delivered a report in 2021 and thus broke through the stalemate of the previous round. However, it did not add much in terms of substance to the clarification of the law. The report reaffirmed that international law, in particular the UN Charter ‘in its entirety’, applies in cyberspace (explicitly including the prohibition on the use of force) and noted again ‘the inherent right of States to take measures consistent with international law and as recognized in the Charter’.\nWhether the UN OEWG, as a more inclusive platform, will be more successful in clarifying the law remains to be seen. So far, the outcomes of the UN OEWG process have been rather limited. They do not go beyond the findings of the UN GGE. In its initial pre-draft from April 2020 and in its final substantive report from 10 March 2021, the UN OEWG noted that States reaffirmed the application of international law, and in particular UN Charter law, to cyberspace.\nIt would go too far to claim that the unwillingness of some States to publish their interpretations and to stay silent is the only reason for the failure of the UN GGE and the UN OEWG to provide more interpretative clarity. Interpretative activity may also lead to disagreement. However, interpretative engagement could have at least paved the way for finding common ground. This is also supported by the recommendations of the UN OEWG pre-draft and final reports, which emphasise the need for further information on the views and practice of States in relation to ‘how’ international law applies in cyberspace.\n# 3. The (legal) politics of silence\nHow can we explain the reluctance of States to refrain from submitting their legal positions on the interpretation of the jus contra bellum in cyberspace and the preference of some to foster new law-making instead of clarifying existing law? As States rarely explain the reasons for their silence, we can only speculate on their motives. A convincing explanation is that their choice for inactivity is driven by a preference for legal ambiguity, which finds its legal rationale in the traditional ‘freedom of State’ paradigm.\nThe discussion on the regulation of cyberwarfare is not only about the correct interpretation of the law but it ‘is as much about strategy, politics and ideological differences’. The interpretative approaches chosen by States often reflect their broader strategical interests, which coincide with their economic, military and technical capacities. Historically this has always been the case; the new reality of cyberwarfare has not changed this. How States interpret jus contra bellum in cyberspace is not independent of their respective ICT strengths and\n. A/RES/73/266 (2019).\n. A/76/135 (2021).\n. ibid [69] and [71(d)].\n.

Moreover, States' interpretations are influenced by their more fundamental ideological perspective on the openness of the internet.\nYet, how does the choice for staying silent fit in this picture? One possible explanation is that States wait for further technical developments before they formulate their own interpretative approaches. The speed and unpredictability of the development of new digital technologies create enormous strategic uncertainties. While economical resources and technical capacities are also of great importance in the context of cyberwarfare, the open structure of cyberspace seems to have re-shuffled many of the old certainties. Small States with a limited budget and little conventional military power can conduct military measures which have a large-scale effect in almost every corner of the world. Despite their strong conventional military powers, traditional strong military and economic powers feel increasingly vulnerable due to their strong digital connectedness. Against the background of these strategic uncertainties, it seems to be – at least at first glance – a rational choice for States to aim at paralysing legal clarification and perpetuating legal uncertainty, as they cannot sufficiently predict the long-term consequences of their own legal interpretation.\nFrom a legal-theoretical perspective, this choice of strategic ambiguity can only be explained by the traditional so-called ‘freedom of State’ paradigm. This state-oriented and subjective perspective paradigm considers the freedom and the will of States paramount. It found its most famous manifestation in the Lotus dictum of the Permanent Court of International Justice in 1927. The court held that\ninternational law governs relations between independent States. The rules of law binding upon States therefore emanate from their own free will as expressed in conventions or by usage generally accepted as expressing principles of law and established in order to regulate the relations between these co-existing independent communities or with a view to the achievement of common aims. Restrictions on the independence of States cannot therefore presumed.\nFrom this perspective, States are only bound by the extent to which they have consented to the rule of international law. Not only the formation of rules, but also their interpretation, follows this paradigm. In an earlier judgment, the PCIJ stated in relation to the interpretation of international law that ‘it is an established principle that the right of giving an authoritative interpretation of a legal rule belongs solely to the person or body who has power to modify or suppress it’. From this point of view, the freedom of State remains the residual rule. Indeterminacy plays into the hand of States.

If States remain silent, they remain free to do what they want.75\nAlternative explanations for interpretative silence do not convince. Disinterest in the topic seems a rather unlikely explanation, given the great relevance of cyber security in contemporary politics. Disagreement among different branches of the government is another possible explanation.76 However, this author is not aware of any such conflicts between different branches of the government within silent States. Coercion of less powerful States to remain silent due to certain power structures and dependencies in international politics (eg of military or economic nature) may also explain their silence. However, the author is not aware of any concrete cases. A final explanation could be that some States have voiced scepticism against the UN GGE. For example, Russia has referred to the UN GGE as ‘a narrow’ and ‘elitist’ expert platform and criticised the report of the UN OEWG for its linkage to the findings of the UN GGE.77 However, this attitude does not explain a general reluctance of States to position themselves outside of the UN GGE context, for example in the more inclusive forum of the UN OEWG.\n## 4. The (legal) consequence of interpretative silence\n## 4.1 States’ interpretation as ‘subsequent practice’\nTo start with the obvious: no State alone can determine the law with a binding effect for itself or for others by positively interpreting it or by not interpreting it. As Weiler and Haltern have argued, ‘autointerpretation, by each state individually, is mostly accepted as a practical inevitability with little, if any, normative value’.78 While States are usually the first and often also the last interpreters of the law (in the absence of delegation of interpretative authority, for example to an international court), it is wrong to claim that ‘each State establishes for itself its legal situation vis-à-vis other States’.79 To state otherwise would go against one of the cornerstones of the international legal order: the equality of States.80 Just as a single State\n75.

Does it matter that some States publish statements on the interpretation of the *jus contra bellum* in cyberspace whereas others refrain from doing so? Does the strategic inactivity leave the law in limbo?\n81.

As a general rule, an ‘agreement’ in the sense of Article 31(3)(a) or (b) must be ‘established’ and therefore it must be positively identifiable. A ‘subsequent agreement’ (lit a) must be clearly manifested (though not necessarily in written form) and *ipso facto* constitutes an ‘authentic interpretation’. For ‘subsequent practice’ (lit b), it must be shown that the understanding is common to the parties of the treaties by evincing a ‘particular conduct or circumstances’ through which an agreement can be identified indirectly. Therefore, ‘a subsequent agreement’ is typically easier to prove than a ‘subsequent practice’.\nA strict threshold of how many States must actively engage in a subsequent practice under lit b is difficult to establish. As a general rule, the value of the subsequent practice ‘depends on the extent to which it is concordant, common and consistent’. Here we can draw a parallel to the requirements of customary international law. ‘Subsequent practice’ under Article 31(3)(b) VCLT in essences equals practice under Article 38(1)(b) of the Statute of the International Court of Justice (ICJ Statute). The main difference is that, in the context of treaty interpretation, a ‘specific’ practice of the parties to the treaty rather than a ‘general’ practice is required. The ICJ made clear that the practice of States (accompanied by the required *opinio juris*) needs to be sufficiently general for formation of a rule of customary international law. It must be ‘extensive’, ‘sufficiently widespread’ and ‘broadly representative’, in particular by those States whose interests are ‘specially affected’. This means that it is not required to prove a positive practice of all parties at all times. There is no strict standard on the exact number of States’ practices that must be positively proven.\n.

It can be sufficient to show that ‘[s]ome States actively create a practice, some by initiating it, some by imitating it, and others by acquiescing in it. Other States may have done nothing, but find themselves bound by the emerging rule’.\nFrom this follows that relevant silence may be considered a confirmation of the developing interpretative ‘agreement’. Under what circumstance it does so, however, remains a much-contested issue in international legal practice and scholarship.\nThe first question is: what kind of behaviour qualifies as silence? A clear case of silence is given if a State does not express itself at all in relation to the interpretation of a treaty and any of its provisions. Such behaviour qualifies as a verbal omission and therefore silence. Generally, statements on the non-application of a treaty or a rule may qualify as relevant ‘subsequent practice’ and do not constitute silence. A sufficient detailedness of the interpretative statement is not required. Inconsistent subsequent practice can be precluded from having a normative effect under the principle of estoppel. Hence, claims by some States that Article 51 UN Charter does not apply in cyberspace are devoid of normative effect, if these States have earlier acknowledged that the UN Charter applies in cyberspace.\nThe second question is whether the State’s intention to confirm a certain interpretation through its silence is decisive or whether we should apply objective criteria and rely on the recipient’s perspective. In a nutshell, voluntarists argue that States’ silence only has the legal effect that conforms to the will of the silent State. For those who support an objective\n107.

For example, Starski argues that ‘silence will never reveal the true beliefs of an actor: “belief” will necessarily be constructed merely from the contextual setting’. In addition, she suggests that international law imposes on States a ‘legislative responsibility’ to engage in active interpretation if the circumstances have called for some reaction to ensure international law’s effectivity and legal certainty. This ‘legislative responsibility’ is only a soft obligation (in German ‘Obliegenheit’, which can be translated into ‘incumbency’) that is not enforceable and sanctionable. Attaching legal effect to States’ silence is a compensation for the ‘soft’ character of this ‘legislative responsibility’. In Starski’s view, such responsibility follows inter alia from a ‘constitutionalist’ reading of international law. In her view, the ‘eminent’ role of States in the process of law creation and evolution ‘endows states with a specific responsibility towards the effectivity of the international legal system’ which depends on a clarification of the law. Only determinacy makes norms operational and allows us to distinguish law from non-law.\nStarski’s argument has merits for several reasons. To start with, the principle of good faith reflected in Article 31(1) VCLT requires States to fulfil their obligation as parties to a treaty, not to impede the effect of the treaty by perpetuating indeterminacy (under certain circumstances, as discussed below).\nWhile a ‘constitutionalist’ reading of international law invoked by Starski comes with challenges, the ‘legislative responsibility takes account of the shift from a purely State-oriented international legal order of co-existence towards a legal order of cooperation that does not only serve States’ interests but also interests of an alleged ‘international commu\nGeneral Principles and Sources of Law’ (1953) 30 British Year Book of International Law 1, 68; Jacques Bentz, ‘Le silence comme manifestation de volonté en Droit international public’ (1963) 67 Revue Général de Droit International Public 44, 45.\n116.

As the ILC noted, ‘acceptance of a practice by one or more parties by way of silence or inaction is not easily established’. In order to find a fair balance between the objectification of silence and consensualist concerns, a close scrutiny of the context and setting of the silence is required. The important qualification is that we can infer consent from silence only – independent of the real intention of the State – if the ‘circumstances were such as called for some reaction’. Only if she must and can speak (*si loqui debuisset ac potuisset*), the neutral maxim that ‘she who keeps silent is held neither to deny nor to accept’ (*qui tacit neque negat, neque utique fatetur*) yields to the maxim that ‘she who keeps silent is held to consent’ (*qui tacit consentire videtur*).\nThe ILC has pointed to two factors that must be considered to establish whether the circumstances ‘called for some reaction’: ‘the legal situation to which the subsequent practice by the other party relates and the claim thereby expressed’. If we break down these two broad criteria into more specific sub-criteria, we can identify nine factors that should be taken into account.\nThe first factor that should be considered is the nature of the State practice itself. It is relevant whether the interpretative action was a singular event or whether it occurred frequently. Moreover, it is relevant whether the interpretative action is consistent and whether it has become commonplace. In this context, the element of time must also be considered: the longer States engage in a certain action, the higher the expectation is that other States react.\n127.

Only if the State claims that its conduct is in conformity with the law can a reaction by other States be legitimately expected. However, this is often difficult to establish in practice.\nThe third factor is whether the silent State was aware (which would be difficult to prove) or 'ought to have been aware' of the conduct of the other State. Moreover, the State must have had the capacity to act.\nThe fourth factor that needs to be included in the assessment is the context in which the relevant claim was made. The more internationally significant a context is, the more it can be expected that States react to claims made in this context. For example, UN organs constitute a highly significant context for claims made in relation to the interpretation of the UN Charter. The more volatile a rule is (either due to ongoing discourses over its meaning, or due to its generally vague character), the more it is expected that States react to claims made by other States. Power relations between States (eg of military or economic nature) must only be considered under certain exceptional circumstances (such as fraud, corruption or threat or coercion by the threat or use of force).\nThe fifth factor concerns the reactions of other actors. If we find ourselves in a situation of accelerating interpretative discourse (indicating increased normative volatility), there can be a higher expectation that 'bystanders' react.\nThe sixth factor to be considered is the impact of the proposed interpretation on rights and interests of States. The more the rights and interests of the State are affected, the more a reaction can be expected. Good arguments, however, speak in favour of not automatically inferring acquiescence in relation to the interpretation of *jus contra bellum*, even though as *erga omnes* obligations the *jus contra bellum* rules embody the interests of the whole international community, which includes every State.

As Starski convincingly argues,\n[t]he very purpose of erga omnes norms would appear to be undermined if the non-protest of bystander states in light of their violation might more easily have a law-altering effect than in the case of ‘ordinary’ rules. ... The erga omnes dimension of norms creates a – rather fictitious – locus standi, but only to the benefit of a norm’s enforceability and not in order to enhance its alterability.\nThe eighth factor to be considered is ‘timeliness’. The greater the impact of the proposed interpretation is on interests and rights of a State, the more it is to be expected that it responds in a timely manner.\nThe ninth and final factor concerns the nature of the affected rules in question. If the rule in question enjoys a jus cogens or erga omnes status, the threshold for modification is set high. Jus cogens norms require a near-universal State practice and can only be substituted by a norm of the same nature (Article 53 VCLT). As such, silence ‘can only under very limited circumstances issue law formative effects in cases in which peremptory norms are at stake if the very concept of jus cogens is to be kept doctrinally intact’.\nIf we apply these standards to the practice of States to the discourse on jus contra bellum in cyberspace, it seems premature to conclude that the silence of States that have not engaged with interpretative proposals made by other States amounts to acquiescence in all contexts.\nTo give one illustrative example: many of those States that have published interpretative statements have endorsed the so-called ‘scale and effects’ test (or a version thereof) that is based on the Nicaragua judgment of the ICJ. Under the ‘scale and effects’ test, a cyber-operation constitutes a ‘use of force’ if its scale and effects are comparable to the scale and effects of a ‘traditional’ use of kinetic force.\nDoes the silence of some States on whether they agree with this interpretation of the law amount to legally relevant acquiescence? Were the circumstances such that they called for some reaction according to the aforementioned standards?\nSeveral of those standards are met. Mere verbal and written statements may constitute relevant ‘subsequent practice’. Article 31(3)(b) VCLT does not require a physical action as\n(commentaries on Articles 48(1)(a) and 48(1)(b)).

The claims relating to the ‘scale’ and ‘effect’ are meant to provide an interpretation of the law and not an explanation of unlawful behaviour (second factor). The silent States had the capacity to act and were (or at least ought to be) aware of these interpretative statements (third factor). The statements were made in internationally significant contexts, such as before the UN GGE and UN OEWG, or through official channels, including homepages of ministries of foreign affairs, or other public fora (fourth factor). The jus contra bellum also consists of rules that are by their very nature volatile (fifth factor).\nHowever, if we look at the other relevant factors, it seems doubtful that the circumstances were already such that they called for some reaction. Arguably, the interpretative statements in relation to the ‘scale’ and ‘effect’ test are not sufficiently consistent and widespread (first factor). While there seems to be an agreement on the overall contours of this test and its applicability in cyberspace, there still seems disagreement on its precise scope, for example in relation to the question of whether cyber-operations causing severe non-physical consequences, such as an attack on the nation’s economic system, may also reach the threshold of a use of force. Several States seem to be in favour of this interpretation. Others, however, seem to be sceptical or leave this question open. It also seems doubtful that a sufficient number of States have publicly subscribed to an application of this test. The subsequent practice must be ‘extensive’ and ‘sufficiently widespread’ and ‘broadly representative’ among States, in particular those whose interests are ‘specially affected’. While the number of States supporting this test is relatively large and seems to be growing, it does not comprise the majority of UN Member States yet. However, it is not unlikely that the relevant threshold will be met in the future, which would increase the expectation of reactions of bystanders.\nMoreover, most States who have begun to position themselves in favour of an application of the ‘scale’ and ‘effect’ in cyberspace test have done so only quite recently (first and eighth factor). The UN OEWG process, in whose context many States have made their statements, has also been only established relatively recently. However, the longer the UN OEWG process is ongoing, the higher the expectation is that other States react to interpretative proposals.\nAs the interpretative proposals relate to the UN Charter and potentially impact rights and interests of all States, one could argue that a reaction can be expected (sixth factor). On the other hand, as has been discussed above, the fact that the UN Charter jus contra bellum rules constitute erga omnes obligations and jus cogens speaks against inferring too easily\n162.

If the rule in question enjoys a *jus cogens* or *erga omnes* status, the threshold for a conclusive interpretation is set very high.\nIn conclusion, good arguments speak in favour of not (yet) qualifying the silence as acquiescence to interpretations that support the ‘scale’ and ‘effect’ test. However, these findings are only a snapshot of the current situation. The more a common position crystallises among a sufficient number of states on the interpretation of the *jus contra bellum* in cyberspace (or specific elements thereof), the more that silent States need to position themselves to avoid their silence being interpreted as acquiescence.\nMoreover, as discussed in the next section, the lack of an interpretative agreement on the ‘scale’ and ‘effect’ test does not necessarily leave the law in limbo as objective interpretative factors must also be considered. International lawyers are justified in making an argument in favour of applying the ‘scale’ and ‘effect’ test to cyberspace on the basis of the wording, objective and purpose of the UN Charter, in light of ICJ jurisprudence (Article 38(1)(d) ICJ Statute).\n## 4.3 The interplay between subjective and objective factors in UN Charter interpretation\nContrary to what the freedom of State paradigm implies, the subjective interpretation of the parties of ‘how’ the UN Charter *jus contra bellum* applies in cyberspace is not the sole factor at play. The subjective interpretation of States is complemented by objective factors, including the ‘ordinary meaning’ of the terms of the treaty (Article 31(1) VCLT), the treaty’s ‘context’ and ‘object and purpose’ (Article 31(1) VCLT), agreements and instruments made with the conclusion of the treaty (Article 31(2) VCLT), and other ‘relevant rules of international law applicable in relations between the parties’ (Article 31(3)(c) VCLT). In treaty interpretation, subjective and objective factors do not stand in a hierarchical relationship with each other; their order merely represents the logical process of interpretation. Subsequent practice is often used in interplay with the other means of interpretation in a ‘single combined operation’. At least, this observation holds true with regard to the practice of the ICJ.\nThe complementary interplay of subjective and objective elements in the interpretation of treaties that follows from Article 31 VLCT takes account of the shift from a purely State-oriented international legal order of co-existence towards a legal order of cooperation that has been discussed above. While the traditional bilateral structure remains the basis to avoid international law sliding into utopianism, treaties have a normative force that is independent from States’ will.\n---\n.

In such circumstances, a non-liquet would have to be declared. It would not be possible to determine the meaning of a provision.\nWhile it would go beyond the scope of the present paper to comprehensively discuss the possibility of gaps in the law, a few remarks should suffice. Although we find instances where courts have accepted a non-liquet, judicial practice and scholarship are generally not willing to do so. International rules are per se shrouded by uncertainty and indeterminacy (as any legal rules). Allowing non-liquet would question the very functionality and effectiveness of international law. The judicial function of judges requires that they concretise norms and provide definite answers to legal questions. The plurality of subjective and objective interpretative tools offered by Articles 31–32 VCLT strongly support the view that non-liquet should not be assumed. Important in this context is Article 31(3)(1) VCLT, which provides a pathway of general principles of international law into every interpretative exercise. General principles’ main function is filling gaps in the law, that is, to avoid lacunae left by the (application of the) other sources of international law.\nWhile the strategic inactivity of many States to publish their practice undoubtedly has negative consequences for the clarification of the jus contra bellum, it does not leave the law in limbo. The law stands despite the relative lack of States’ contribution to its clarification. Even if States establish a subsequent interpretative agreement in the sense of Article 31(1)(a) or (b) VCLT, such an agreement is only one factor among others that must be considered.\n## 4.5 The role of courts, organs of international organisations and the ILC and the lack of centralised interpretative authority\nAgainst this background, legal ambiguity in the present context is not the consequence of a gap in the law that follows from the interpretative silence of states; rather, it is a misnomer for the lack of centralised interpretative authority in international law. States are not the only relevant actors in the interpretation of international law. A number of institutional actors could potentially play an important role in the normative discourse on ‘how’ jus contra bellum applies in cyberspace, such as international courts and tribunals, organs of international organisations (most importantly UN organs), and the International Law Commission (ILC). However, none of these institutional actors has been equipped with the centralised authority to decide what the correct interpretation of the law is. As such, the clarification of the law is left to an open-ended discursive process.\n---\n. *Non liquet* transl. ‘it is not clear’.\n.

However, in matters of *jus contra bellum* in cyberspace, international courts and tribunals often lack the jurisdiction to provide interpretative clarification. Even though the ICJ had for a while a considerable number of cases (directly or indirectly) concerning the use of force before it, this trend has not continued, and most of the cases did not make it to the merits. Importantly for us, the Court has not dealt with questions concerning *jus contra bellum* in cyberspace and it is not likely that it will do so in the near future; other courts or tribunals that may take up the issues are also not in sight.\nWhile the UN GGE played a significant role as a facilitator of normative discourse, it has never been a platform that could have authoritatively determined the correct interpretation of the *jus contra bellum*. The UN GGE was not invested with the power to create new international law. The reports of the UN GGE do not set legal norms themselves. Even if one supports the view that the practice of organs or sub-organs of international organisations may be directly relevant under Article 31–32 VCLT, for example as relevant ‘subsequent practice’, good arguments speak against attaching significant weight to the practice of the UN GGE. The reports only represent the views of experts of a limited number of States (initially 15, now 25). What matters is the reception by all parties to the UN Charter and other international organs of the UN, such as the UN GA.\nThe UN GA may take up issues on *jus contra bellum* in cyberspace and has done so, for example by ‘taking note’ of the assessments and recommendations of the two first UN GGE reports (2010 and 2013) and by ‘welcoming’ the ‘conclusions’ of the third UN GGE report (2015, without a vote, meaning by consensus). However, rather than constituting a centralised form of interpretation, the UN GA practice reflects the cumulative practice of individual States.\n---\n On the role of ‘judicial decisions’ as ‘subsidiary means, see Mads Andenas and Johann R Leiss, ‘The Systemic Relevance of “Judicial Decisions” in International Law’ (2017) 77 Zeitschrift für ausländisches öffentliches Recht und Völkerrecht 907, 934–935.\n Cf Christine Gray, ‘The Use and Abuse of the International Court of Justice: Cases concerning the Use of Force after Nicaragua’ (2003) 14 European Journal of International Law 867.

However, to date the UN Security Council has not taken up the issue. Moreover, UN Security Council resolutions do not represent an authoritative interpretation of the UN Charter that binds States beyond the individual case and often require further interpretation by the member States of the UN.\nThe ILC is another institution that potentially plays a role in clarifying (and even developing) the jus contra bellum in cyberspace. However, the suggestion to refer the issue to the ILC that was included in the initial pre-draft report of the OEWG was met by scepticism of several States. They consider it premature to involve the ILC at this stage, since the practice of States is as yet too scarce for the ILC to carry out a meaningful analysis.\nFor the future, however, it cannot be excluded that these actors will contribute to crystallisation of the ‘correct’ interpretation of the law. While their interpretation must (also) be grounded in the will of States, they will mainly process positive manifestations of those States that have actively made their position clear or, in the absence of a clearly identifiable common and consistent practice, have recourse to the objective means of interpretation.\n# 5. Conclusion\nThis article has discussed the politics and legal rationale behind the reluctance of some States to help clarify ‘how’ jus contra bellum applies in cyberspace. It has shown that interpretative silence may backfire in the long run. States’ silence may be interpreted – though only under strict conditions – as acquiescence to an emerging, widely accepted interpretation of the law. Moreover, objective factors beyond the subjective interpretation of States may come to the fore if too many States remain silent and thereby prevent the crystallisation of a sufficiently widely accepted interpretation of the law.\nIn light of these findings, initiatives that encourage States to make their positions publicly available are to be welcomed from a rule of law perspective. They are also in States’ own interests. The vital role of the jus contra bellum rules for the maintenance of peace and security requires interpretative clarity to ensure their efficiency and transparency.

Moreover, interpretation and development of the law would be left to military considerations that all too easily exclude other concerns.\nWhether these calls for more interpretative activity will make the UN OEWG process more successful than the UN GGE remains to be seen. It is more inclusive than the UN GGE and allows more States to be heard. However, the first impression does not seem very promising. The UN OEWG’s initial pre-draft and final report have not added anything substantive to the work of the UN GGE in matters of jus contra bellum in cyberspace.196\nIf the global dialogue on jus contra bellum in cyberspace remains unsuccessful, it seems likely that the path will steer away from global initiatives towards regional processes among like-minded states or even bilateral agreements.197 The US has already indicated that they would consider focusing on ‘likeminded partners’ to tackle cybersecurity issues.198 Likewise, Russia increasingly turns towards the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO).199 Other regional platforms are also becoming involved in cybersecurity issues, such as the Organization of American States, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Regional Forum, the Economic Community of West African States, the African Union, the European Union,200 the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe,201 and the Council of Europe.\nWhile the greater involvement of regional processes in the normative discourse is not a bad thing per se, the universal character of the UN Charter requires universal solutions to avoid ‘fragmentation of the international norms discourse’.202\n## Acknowledgment\nWork on this paper has been conducted under the aegis of the project ‘Security in Internet Governance and Networks: Analysing the Law’ (SIGNAL), funded by the Norwegian Research Council and UNINETT Norid AS.

What kind of activities constitute an ‘armed attack’ and might give a State cause to invoke its inherent right to self-defence (Article 51 UN Charter)?¹⁷ Where along the spectrum of permissible to impermissible conduct do various types of cyber-attacks lie? How is mere cyber-criminality to be distinguished from warfare? Should we apply the so-called ‘scale and effects’ test according to which a cyberoperation constitutes a ‘use of force’ if its scale and effects are comparable to the scale and effects of a ‘traditional’ use of kinetic force? How can we attribute use of force in cyberspace?¹⁸ More generally, how do we apply rules that are based on the existence of geographical borders, over which States exercise sovereignty, to cyberspace, in which such borders are far from distinct?¹⁹ Considering these open questions, it is all the more remarkable that many States shy away from actively contributing to the interpretative clarification of the law. They do not publish interpretative statements and do not make their practice of cyberwarfare public. Part 2 discusses the (in)activity of States to contribute to the interpretative clarification of ‘how’ jus contra bellum applies in cyberspace and discusses its negative repercussions for the work of the UN GGE and UN OEWG. Part 3 discusses possible explanations for the (legal) politics behind this interpretative silence. It argues that silence can be explained by a strategy of legal ambiguity, which finds its legal rationale in the traditional ‘freedom of State’ paradigm. The aim of this strategy is to keep the jus contra bellum in limbo and open scope for manoeuvre to cope with new technical developments and remaining strategic uncertainties in cyberwarfare. Part 4 discusses the (legal) consequences of interpretative silence and challenges its underlying rationale. The argument is that under the discursive framework provided by Articles 31–33 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (‘VCLT’)²⁰, the interpretation – or non-interpretation – of the parties to a treaty remains a central factor to be taken into account. However, it is only by actively contributing to the clarification of the law that States ensure their voice is heard and avoid the risk that their silence is interpreted as acquiescence. Moreover, contrary to what the freedom of State paradigm implies, the subjective interpretation of the parties is not the only ‘game in town’. Articles 31–32 VCLT and other factors complement the subjective dimension of interpretation with an objective one. The less the ‘authentic’ interpretation of the parties leads to interpretative clarification, the more the other modes of interpretation come to the fore. As such, legal ambiguity is a misnomer for the lack of centralised interpretative authority in international law.

In the author’s view, the UN Charter-based *jus contra bellum* norms and their customary corollaries have merged into a single norm,²¹ even though the customary manifestation is based in a different source, and insofar remains conceptually independent from its treaty corollary.²² Article 103 UN Charter, which attaches supremacy to UN Charter law over other international law, also applies to customary international law.²³ As such, customary derogation from the UN Charter based *jus contra bellum* is excluded. Under what conditions an interpretation of UN Charter law amounts to a modification of the rules in question must not be conclusively discussed here. While further development of the Charter by consensual re-interpretation and customary application is possible,²⁴ for the present purpose it is sufficient to keep in mind that it is not easily to be presumed that States want to circumvent the strict requirements for Charter amendments (Articles 108 and 109 UN Charter).²⁵ There are, however, notable examples of informal UN Charter modification.²⁶ ### 2.2 Widespread interpretative silence Considering the overall picture, we see that many States remain reluctant to clearly position themselves and contribute to a clarification of ‘how’ *jus contra bellum* applies in cyberspace.²⁷ An increasing number of States have published ‘cyber security strategies’,²⁸ and a growing number of States have also begun to publish statements on international law in cyberspace.²⁹ ---",

It acknowledged the problem of attribution of cyberoperations and risk of potential threats, the ‘absence of a common understanding regarding acceptable State behaviour’, and more generally, the ‘lack of shared understanding regarding international norms pertaining to State use of ICTs’.⁴³ Furthermore, it noted that ‘[e]xisting agreements include norms relevant to the use of ICTs by States’, that ‘additional norms could be developed over time’, and that the dialogue should continue.⁴⁴ In 2011, a third group of experts (again 15 members) was set up.⁴⁵ This time the mandate of the group specifically asked not only for a discussion of ‘international concepts aimed at",

As such, the report did not add much to the clarification of ‘how’ jus contra bellum applies in cyberspace.⁵⁶ In 2015, a fifth group of experts was established, again with an increased number of members (now 25).⁵⁷ This time, however, the discussions proved even more difficult than in the previous rounds. In June 2017, the experts failed to agree on a draft for a consensus report.⁵⁸ As previously mentioned, one explanation is that Cuba, China and Russia opposed the inclusion of references to the application of the right to self-defence (and the general international law principles of countermeasures and international humanitarian law).⁵⁹",

The report reaffirmed that international law, in particular the UN Charter ‘in its entirety’, applies in cyberspace (explicitly including the prohibition on the use of force) and noted again ‘the inherent right of States to take measures consistent with international law and as recognized in the Charter’.⁶² Whether the UN OEWG, as a more inclusive platform, will be more successful in clarifying the law remains to be seen. So far, the outcomes of the UN OEWG process have been rather limited. They do not go beyond the findings of the UN GGE.⁶³ In its initial pre-draft from April 2020⁶⁴ and in its final substantive report from 10 March 2021,⁶⁵ the UN OEWG noted that States reaffirmed the application of international law, and in particular UN Charter law, to cyberspace. It would go too far to claim that the unwillingness of some States to publish their interpretations and to stay silent is the only reason for the failure of the UN GGE and the UN OEWG to provide more interpretative clarity. Interpretative activity may also lead to disagreement. However, interpretative engagement could have at least paved the way for finding common ground. This is also supported by the recommendations of the UN OEWG pre-draft and final reports, which emphasise the need for further information on the views and practice of States in relation to ‘how’ international law applies in cyberspace.⁶⁶ # 3. The (legal) politics of silence How can we explain the reluctance of States to refrain from submitting their legal positions on the interpretation of the jus contra bellum in cyberspace and the preference of some to foster new law-making instead of clarifying existing law? As States rarely explain the reasons for their silence, we can only speculate on their motives. A convincing explanation is that their choice for inactivity is driven by a preference for legal ambiguity, which finds its legal rationale in the traditional ‘freedom of State’ paradigm. The discussion on the regulation of cyberwarfare is not only about the correct interpretation of the law but it ‘is as much about strategy, politics and ideological differences’.⁶⁷ The interpretative approaches chosen by States often reflect their broader strategical interests, which coincide with their economic, military and technical capacities.⁶⁸ Historically this has always been the case; the new reality of cyberwarfare has not changed this.

One possible explanation is that States wait for further technical developments before they formulate their own interpretative approaches. The speed and unpredictability of the development of new digital technologies create enormous strategic uncertainties.⁷¹ While economical resources and technical capacities are also of great importance in the context of cyberwarfare, the open structure of cyberspace seems to have re-shuffled many of the old certainties. Small States with a limited budget and little conventional military power can conduct military measures which have a large-scale effect in almost every corner of the world. Despite their strong conventional military powers, traditional strong military and economic powers feel increasingly vulnerable due to their strong digital connectedness. Against the background of these strategic uncertainties, it seems to be – at least at first glance – a rational choice for States to aim at paralysing legal clarification and perpetuating legal uncertainty, as they cannot sufficiently predict the long-term consequences of their own legal interpretation.⁷² From a legal-theoretical perspective, this choice of strategic ambiguity can only be explained by the traditional so-called ‘freedom of State’ paradigm. This state-oriented and subjective perspective paradigm considers the freedom and the will of States paramount. It found its most famous manifestation in the Lotus dictum of the Permanent Court of International Justice in 1927. The court held that international law governs relations between independent States. The rules of law binding upon States therefore emanate from their own free will as expressed in conventions or by usage generally accepted as expressing principles of law and established in order to regulate the relations between these co-existing independent communities or with a view to the achievement of common aims. Restrictions on the independence of States cannot therefore presumed.⁷³ From this perspective, States are only bound by the extent to which they have consented to the rule of international law. Not only the formation of rules, but also their interpretation, follows this paradigm. In an earlier judgment, the PCIJ stated in relation to the interpretation of international law that ‘it is an established principle that the right of giving an authoritative interpretation of a legal rule belongs solely to the person or body who has power to modify or suppress it’.⁷⁴ From this point of view, the freedom of State remains the residual rule. Indeterminacy plays into the hand of States.

If States remain silent, they remain free to do what they want.75 Alternative explanations for interpretative silence do not convince. Disinterest in the topic seems a rather unlikely explanation, given the great relevance of cyber security in contemporary politics. Disagreement among different branches of the government is another possible explanation.76 However, this author is not aware of any such conflicts between different branches of the government within silent States. Coercion of less powerful States to remain silent due to certain power structures and dependencies in international politics (eg of military or economic nature) may also explain their silence. However, the author is not aware of any concrete cases. A final explanation could be that some States have voiced scepticism against the UN GGE. For example, Russia has referred to the UN GGE as ‘a narrow’ and ‘elitist’ expert platform and criticised the report of the UN OEWG for its linkage to the findings of the UN GGE.77 However, this attitude does not explain a general reluctance of States to position themselves outside of the UN GGE context, for example in the more inclusive forum of the UN OEWG. ## 4. The (legal) consequence of interpretative silence ## 4.1 States’ interpretation as ‘subsequent practice’ To start with the obvious: no State alone can determine the law with a binding effect for itself or for others by positively interpreting it or by not interpreting it. As Weiler and Haltern have argued, ‘autointerpretation, by each state individually, is mostly accepted as a practical inevitability with little, if any, normative value’.78 While States are usually the first and often also the last interpreters of the law (in the absence of delegation of interpretative authority, for example to an international court), it is wrong to claim that ‘each State establishes for itself its legal situation vis-à-vis other States’.79 To state otherwise would go against one of the cornerstones of the international legal order: the equality of States.80 Just as a single State",

JOHANN RUBEN LEISS Absence of interpretation of some States does not necessarily stall the establishment of the authentic interpretation of the treaty provision in question. As a general rule, an ‘agreement’ in the sense of Article 31(3)(a) or (b) must be ‘established’ and therefore it must be positively identifiable.⁹¹ A ‘subsequent agreement’ (lit a) must be clearly manifested (though not necessarily in written form) and *ipso facto* constitutes an ‘authentic interpretation’.⁹² For ‘subsequent practice’ (lit b), it must be shown that the understanding is common to the parties of the treaties by evincing a ‘particular conduct or circumstances’ through which an agreement can be identified indirectly.⁹³ Therefore, ‘a subsequent agreement’ is typically easier to prove than a ‘subsequent practice’.⁹⁴ A strict threshold of how many States must actively engage in a subsequent practice under lit b is difficult to establish.⁹⁵ As a general rule, the value of the subsequent practice ‘depends on the extent to which it is concordant, common and consistent’.⁹⁶ Here we can draw a parallel to the requirements of customary international law. ‘Subsequent practice’ under Article 31(3)(b) VCLT in essences equals practice under Article 38(1)(b) of the Statute of the International Court of Justice (ICJ Statute)⁹⁷.⁹⁸ The main difference is that, in the context of treaty interpretation, a ‘specific’ practice of the parties to the treaty rather than a ‘general’ practice is required.⁹⁹ The ICJ made clear that the practice of States (accompanied by the required *opinio juris*) needs to be sufficiently general for formation of a rule of customary international law.¹⁰⁰ It must be ‘extensive’,¹⁰¹ ‘sufficiently widespread’¹⁰² and ‘broadly representative’,¹⁰³ in particular by those States whose interests are ‘specially affected’.¹⁰⁴ This means that it is not required to prove a positive practice of all parties at all times.¹⁰⁵ There is no strict standard on the exact number of States’ practices that must be positively proven.¹⁰⁶ ⁹¹.

OSLO LAW REVIEW | VOLUME 9 | No.1-2022 39 As the ICJ held in the case concerning the Temple of Preah Vihear, ‘where it is clear that the circumstances were such as called for some reaction, within a reasonable period’, the State that is confronted with a certain subsequent practice by another party and does not react ‘must be held to have acquiesced’.¹⁰⁷ It can be sufficient to show that ‘[s]ome States actively create a practice, some by initiating it, some by imitating it, and others by acquiescing in it. Other States may have done nothing, but find themselves bound by the emerging rule’.¹⁰⁸ From this follows that relevant silence may be considered a confirmation of the developing interpretative ‘agreement’.¹⁰⁹ Under what circumstance it does so, however, remains a much-contested issue in international legal practice and scholarship.¹¹⁰ The first question is: what kind of behaviour qualifies as silence? A clear case of silence is given if a State does not express itself at all in relation to the interpretation of a treaty and any of its provisions. Such behaviour qualifies as a verbal omission and therefore silence.¹¹¹ Generally, statements on the non-application of a treaty or a rule may qualify as relevant ‘subsequent practice’ and do not constitute silence.¹¹² A sufficient detailedness of the interpretative statement is not required. Inconsistent subsequent practice can be precluded from having a normative effect under the principle of estoppel.¹¹³ Hence, claims by some States that Article 51 UN Charter does not apply in cyberspace are devoid of normative effect, if these States have earlier acknowledged that the UN Charter applies in cyberspace. The second question is whether the State’s intention to confirm a certain interpretation through its silence is decisive or whether we should apply objective criteria and rely on the recipient’s perspective.¹¹⁴ In a nutshell, voluntarists argue that States’ silence only has the legal effect that conforms to the will of the silent State.¹¹⁵ For those who support an objective",

Attaching legal effect to States’ silence is a compensation for the ‘soft’ character of this ‘legislative responsibility’.¹²¹ In Starski’s view, such responsibility follows inter alia from a ‘constitutionalist’ reading of international law.¹²² In her view, the ‘eminent’ role of States in the process of law creation and evolution ‘endows states with a specific responsibility towards the effectivity of the international legal system’ which depends on a clarification of the law.¹²³ Only determinacy makes norms operational and allows us to distinguish law from non-law.¹²⁴ Starski’s argument has merits for several reasons. To start with, the principle of good faith reflected in Article 31(1) VCLT requires States to fulfil their obligation as parties to a treaty, not to impede the effect of the treaty by perpetuating indeterminacy (under certain circumstances, as discussed below).¹²⁵ While a ‘constitutionalist’ reading of international law invoked by Starski comes with challenges,¹²⁶ the ‘legislative responsibility takes account of the shift from a purely State-oriented international legal order of co-existence towards a legal order of cooperation that does not only serve States’ interests but also interests of an alleged ‘international commu General Principles and Sources of Law’ (1953) 30 British Year Book of International Law 1, 68; Jacques Bentz, ‘Le silence comme manifestation de volonté en Droit international public’ (1963) 67 Revue Général de Droit International Public 44, 45.",

As Starski convincingly argues, [t]he very purpose of erga omnes norms would appear to be undermined if the non-protest of bystander states in light of their violation might more easily have a law-altering effect than in the case of ‘ordinary’ rules. ... The erga omnes dimension of norms creates a – rather fictitious – locus standi, but only to the benefit of a norm’s enforceability and not in order to enhance its alterability.¹⁵⁴ The eighth factor to be considered is ‘timeliness’.¹⁵⁵ The greater the impact of the proposed interpretation is on interests and rights of a State, the more it is to be expected that it responds in a timely manner.¹⁵⁶ The ninth and final factor concerns the nature of the affected rules in question.¹⁵⁷ If the rule in question enjoys a jus cogens or erga omnes status, the threshold for modification is set high. Jus cogens norms require a near-universal State practice and can only be substituted by a norm of the same nature (Article 53 VCLT). As such, silence ‘can only under very limited circumstances issue law formative effects in cases in which peremptory norms are at stake if the very concept of jus cogens is to be kept doctrinally intact’.¹⁵⁸ If we apply these standards to the practice of States to the discourse on jus contra bellum in cyberspace, it seems premature to conclude that the silence of States that have not engaged with interpretative proposals made by other States amounts to acquiescence in all contexts. To give one illustrative example: many of those States that have published interpretative statements have endorsed the so-called ‘scale and effects’ test (or a version thereof)¹⁵⁹ that is based on the Nicaragua judgment of the ICJ.¹⁶⁰ Under the ‘scale and effects’ test, a cyber-operation constitutes a ‘use of force’ if its scale and effects are comparable to the scale and effects of a ‘traditional’ use of kinetic force.¹⁶¹ Does the silence of some States on whether they agree with this interpretation of the law amount to legally relevant acquiescence? Were the circumstances such that they called for some reaction according to the aforementioned standards? Several of those standards are met. Mere verbal and written statements may constitute relevant ‘subsequent practice’. Article 31(3)(b) VCLT does not require a physical action as (commentaries on Articles 48(1)(a) and 48(1)(b)).

The silent States had the capacity to act and were (or at least ought to be) aware of these interpretative statements (third factor). The statements were made in internationally significant contexts, such as before the UN GGE and UN OEWG, or through official channels, including homepages of ministries of foreign affairs, or other public fora (fourth factor). The jus contra bellum also consists of rules that are by their very nature volatile (fifth factor). However, if we look at the other relevant factors, it seems doubtful that the circumstances were already such that they called for some reaction. Arguably, the interpretative statements in relation to the ‘scale’ and ‘effect’ test are not sufficiently consistent and widespread (first factor). While there seems to be an agreement on the overall contours of this test and its applicability in cyberspace, there still seems disagreement on its precise scope, for example in relation to the question of whether cyber-operations causing severe non-physical consequences, such as an attack on the nation’s economic system, may also reach the threshold of a use of force. Several States seem to be in favour of this interpretation.¹⁶³ Others, however, seem to be sceptical or leave this question open.¹⁶⁴ It also seems doubtful that a sufficient number of States have publicly subscribed to an application of this test. The subsequent practice must be ‘extensive’¹⁶⁵ and ‘sufficiently widespread’¹⁶⁶ and ‘broadly representative’¹⁶⁷ among States, in particular those whose interests are ‘specially affected’.¹⁶⁸ While the number of States supporting this test is relatively large and seems to be growing, it does not comprise the majority of UN Member States yet. However, it is not unlikely that the relevant threshold will be met in the future, which would increase the expectation of reactions of bystanders. Moreover, most States who have begun to position themselves in favour of an application of the ‘scale’ and ‘effect’ in cyberspace test have done so only quite recently (first and eighth factor). The UN OEWG process, in whose context many States have made their statements, has also been only established relatively recently. However, the longer the UN OEWG process is ongoing, the higher the expectation is that other States react to interpretative proposals. As the interpretative proposals relate to the UN Charter and potentially impact rights and interests of all States, one could argue that a reaction can be expected (sixth factor). On the other hand, as has been discussed above, the fact that the UN Charter jus contra bellum rules constitute erga omnes obligations and jus cogens¹⁶⁹ speaks against inferring too easily",

OSLO LAW REVIEW | VOLUME 9 | No.1-2022 45 acquiescence from silence. If the rule in question enjoys a *jus cogens* or *erga omnes* status, the threshold for a conclusive interpretation is set very high. In conclusion, good arguments speak in favour of not (yet) qualifying the silence as acquiescence to interpretations that support the ‘scale’ and ‘effect’ test. However, these findings are only a snapshot of the current situation. The more a common position crystallises among a sufficient number of states on the interpretation of the *jus contra bellum* in cyberspace (or specific elements thereof), the more that silent States need to position themselves to avoid their silence being interpreted as acquiescence. Moreover, as discussed in the next section, the lack of an interpretative agreement on the ‘scale’ and ‘effect’ test does not necessarily leave the law in limbo as objective interpretative factors must also be considered. International lawyers are justified in making an argument in favour of applying the ‘scale’ and ‘effect’ test to cyberspace on the basis of the wording, objective and purpose of the UN Charter, in light of ICJ jurisprudence (Article 38(1)(d) ICJ Statute). ## 4.3 The interplay between subjective and objective factors in UN Charter interpretation Contrary to what the freedom of State paradigm implies, the subjective interpretation of the parties of ‘how’ the UN Charter *jus contra bellum* applies in cyberspace is not the sole factor at play. The subjective interpretation of States is complemented by objective factors, including the ‘ordinary meaning’ of the terms of the treaty (Article 31(1) VCLT), the treaty’s ‘context’ and ‘object and purpose’ (Article 31(1) VCLT), agreements and instruments made with the conclusion of the treaty (Article 31(2) VCLT), and other ‘relevant rules of international law applicable in relations between the parties’ (Article 31(3)(c) VCLT). In treaty interpretation, subjective and objective factors do not stand in a hierarchical relationship with each other; their order merely represents the logical process of interpretation.¹⁷⁰ Subsequent practice is often used in interplay with the other means of interpretation in a ‘single combined operation’.¹⁷¹ At least, this observation holds true with regard to the practice of the ICJ.¹⁷² The complementary interplay of subjective and objective elements in the interpretation of treaties that follows from Article 31 VLCT takes account of the shift from a purely State-oriented international legal order of co-existence towards a legal order of cooperation that has been discussed above.¹⁷³ While the traditional bilateral structure remains the basis to avoid international law sliding into utopianism, treaties have a normative force that is independent from States’ will.¹⁷⁴ --- ¹⁷⁰.

ILC’s first report on subsequent practice (n 76) 62 [42]–64 [53]. See, however, Kadelbach (n 84) 78–79 [14], who observes that subsequent practice has gained increasing relevance in the interpretation of the UN Charter. In some international legal sub-regimes, such as international economic and human rights, it seems as if adjudicative bodies attach more importance to the object and purpose or the ordinary meaning of than on subsequent practice, cf ILC’s first report on subsequent practice (n 76) 64 [53]. ¹⁷³.

JOHANN RUBEN LEISS Exclusive reliance on the will of States in treaty interpretation would easily lead to gaps in the law if States do not develop a common understanding. In such circumstances, a non-liquet would have to be declared.¹⁷⁵ It would not be possible to determine the meaning of a provision. While it would go beyond the scope of the present paper to comprehensively discuss the possibility of gaps in the law, a few remarks should suffice. Although we find instances where courts have accepted a non-liquet,¹⁷⁶ judicial practice and scholarship are generally not willing to do so.¹⁷⁷ International rules are per se shrouded by uncertainty and indeterminacy (as any legal rules).¹⁷⁸ Allowing non-liquet would question the very functionality and effectiveness of international law. The judicial function of judges requires that they concretise norms and provide definite answers to legal questions.¹⁷⁹ The plurality of subjective and objective interpretative tools offered by Articles 31–32 VCLT strongly support the view that non-liquet should not be assumed. Important in this context is Article 31(3)(1) VCLT, which provides a pathway of general principles of international law into every interpretative exercise. General principles’ main function is filling gaps in the law, that is, to avoid lacunae left by the (application of the) other sources of international law.¹⁸⁰ While the strategic inactivity of many States to publish their practice undoubtedly has negative consequences for the clarification of the jus contra bellum, it does not leave the law in limbo. The law stands despite the relative lack of States’ contribution to its clarification. Even if States establish a subsequent interpretative agreement in the sense of Article 31(1)(a) or (b) VCLT, such an agreement is only one factor among others that must be considered. ## 4.5 The role of courts, organs of international organisations and the ILC and the lack of centralised interpretative authority Against this background, legal ambiguity in the present context is not the consequence of a gap in the law that follows from the interpretative silence of states; rather, it is a misnomer for the lack of centralised interpretative authority in international law. States are not the only relevant actors in the interpretation of international law. A number of institutional actors could potentially play an important role in the normative discourse on ‘how’ jus contra bellum applies in cyberspace, such as international courts and tribunals, organs of international organisations (most importantly UN organs), and the International Law Commission (ILC). However, none of these institutional actors has been equipped with the centralised authority to decide what the correct interpretation of the law is. As such, the clarification of the law is left to an open-ended discursive process. --- ¹⁷⁵. *Non liquet* transl. ‘it is not clear’. ¹⁷⁶.

Even though the ICJ had for a while a considerable number of cases (directly or indirectly) concerning the use of force before it,¹⁸² this trend has not continued, and most of the cases did not make it to the merits.¹⁸³ Importantly for us, the Court has not dealt with questions concerning *jus contra bellum* in cyberspace and it is not likely that it will do so in the near future; other courts or tribunals that may take up the issues are also not in sight. While the UN GGE played a significant role as a facilitator of normative discourse, it has never been a platform that could have authoritatively determined the correct interpretation of the *jus contra bellum*. The UN GGE was not invested with the power to create new international law.¹⁸⁴ The reports of the UN GGE do not set legal norms themselves. Even if one supports the view that the practice of organs or sub-organs of international organisations may be directly relevant under Article 31–32 VCLT,¹⁸⁵ for example as relevant ‘subsequent practice’, good arguments speak against attaching significant weight to the practice of the UN GGE. The reports only represent the views of experts of a limited number of States (initially 15, now 25). What matters is the reception by all parties to the UN Charter and other international organs of the UN, such as the UN GA. The UN GA may take up issues on *jus contra bellum* in cyberspace and has done so, for example by ‘taking note’ of the assessments and recommendations of the two first UN GGE reports (2010 and 2013) and by ‘welcoming’ the ‘conclusions’ of the third UN GGE report (2015, without a vote, meaning by consensus).¹⁸⁶ However, rather than constituting a centralised form of interpretation, the UN GA practice reflects the cumulative practice of individual States.¹⁸⁷ --- ¹⁸¹ On the role of ‘judicial decisions’ as ‘subsidiary means, see Mads Andenas and Johann R Leiss, ‘The Systemic Relevance of “Judicial Decisions” in International Law’ (2017) 77 Zeitschrift für ausländisches öffentliches Recht und Völkerrecht 907, 934–935. ¹⁸² Cf Christine Gray, ‘The Use and Abuse of the International Court of Justice: Cases concerning the Use of Force after Nicaragua’ (2003) 14 European Journal of International Law 867.

They consider it premature to involve the ILC at this stage, since the practice of States is as yet too scarce for the ILC to carry out a meaningful analysis.¹⁹³ For the future, however, it cannot be excluded that these actors will contribute to crystallisation of the ‘correct’ interpretation of the law. While their interpretation must (also) be grounded in the will of States, they will mainly process positive manifestations of those States that have actively made their position clear or, in the absence of a clearly identifiable common and consistent practice, have recourse to the objective means of interpretation. # 5. Conclusion This article has discussed the politics and legal rationale behind the reluctance of some States to help clarify ‘how’ jus contra bellum applies in cyberspace. It has shown that interpretative silence may backfire in the long run. States’ silence may be interpreted – though only under strict conditions – as acquiescence to an emerging, widely accepted interpretation of the law. Moreover, objective factors beyond the subjective interpretation of States may come to the fore if too many States remain silent and thereby prevent the crystallisation of a sufficiently widely accepted interpretation of the law. In light of these findings, initiatives that encourage States to make their positions publicly available are to be welcomed from a rule of law perspective.¹⁹⁴ They are also in States’ own interests. The vital role of the jus contra bellum rules for the maintenance of peace and security requires interpretative clarity to ensure their efficiency and transparency.

Moreover, interpretation and development of the law would be left to military considerations that all too easily exclude other concerns. Whether these calls for more interpretative activity will make the UN OEWG process more successful than the UN GGE remains to be seen. It is more inclusive than the UN GGE and allows more States to be heard. However, the first impression does not seem very promising. The UN OEWG’s initial pre-draft and final report have not added anything substantive to the work of the UN GGE in matters of jus contra bellum in cyberspace.196 If the global dialogue on jus contra bellum in cyberspace remains unsuccessful, it seems likely that the path will steer away from global initiatives towards regional processes among like-minded states or even bilateral agreements.197 The US has already indicated that they would consider focusing on ‘likeminded partners’ to tackle cybersecurity issues.198 Likewise, Russia increasingly turns towards the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO).199 Other regional platforms are also becoming involved in cybersecurity issues, such as the Organization of American States, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Regional Forum, the Economic Community of West African States, the African Union, the European Union,200 the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe,201 and the Council of Europe. While the greater involvement of regional processes in the normative discourse is not a bad thing per se, the universal character of the UN Charter requires universal solutions to avoid ‘fragmentation of the international norms discourse’.202 ## Acknowledgment Work on this paper has been conducted under the aegis of the project ‘Security in Internet Governance and Networks: Analysing the Law’ (SIGNAL), funded by the Norwegian Research Council and UNINETT Norid AS.

(EUI), Associate Professor, Inland Norway University of Applied Science (Lillehammer) and Associate Professor II, University of Oslo\njohann.leiss@inn.no\n## Abstract\nThis article explores the (in)activity of many States in contributing to the interpretative clarification of 'how' jus contra bellum applies in cyberspace, its negative repercussions for the work of the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing responsible State behaviour in cyberspace in the context of international security (UN GGE) and the United Nations Open-Ended Working Group on Developments in the Field of ICTs in the Context of International Security (UN OEWG), and the way forward. In its main part, the article analyses the (legal) consequences of interpretative silence and challenges its (presumably) underlying rationale – that is, a strategy of legal ambiguity based on the traditional 'freedom of State' paradigm. This article argues that it is only by actively contributing to the clarification of the law that States ensure their voice is heard and avoid the risk that their silence is interpreted as acquiescence. Moreover, contrary to what the freedom of State paradigm implies, the subjective interpretation of the parties is not the only 'game in town'. If no interpretative agreement of States crystallises, the interpretation of jus contra bellum is determined by objective factors. The article concludes by arguing that from a rule of law perspective, States should be encouraged to express their views on 'how' jus contra bellum applies in cyberspace to ensure the efficiency and transparency of these rules, which constitute part of the backbone of a peaceful co-existence and cooperation between states.\n## Keywords\njus contra bellum, cyberwarfare, treaty interpretation, acquiescence, UN GGE, UN OEWG\n## 1. Introduction\nAmong the great challenges to international law posed by the digitisation of our modern world is the fact that modern warfare has expanded into cyberspace. As with any technical developments in human history, warfare has taken up new digital technologies. Modern armies have the capability to cause death and destruction via cyberspace. At the same time, societies have become increasingly vulnerable. Much critical infrastructure is digitalised,\n1. On the term ‘cyberspace’, see François Delerue, *Cyber Operations and International Law* (CUP 2020) 10–13, 29.\n2.

Cyber-operations may, as Roscini writes, ‘disable power generators, cut off the military command, control, and communication systems, cause trains to derail and aeroplanes to crash, nuclear reactors to melt down, pipelines to explode, weapons to malfunction, banking systems to cripple’. The possible modes of ‘cyberwarfare’ range from small-scale operations – some sort of web vandalism – to severe attacks on critical infrastructure. Geographical distance and time become less relevant; any target can be hit within seconds from any place in the world that has an internet connection.\nThe fundamental question of whether the law on the use of force (the *jus ad bellum*; or in modern parlance *jus contra bellum*) as enshrined in Articles 2(4) and 51 of the Charter of the United Nations (‘UN Charter’) and in their customary equivalents apply to cyberspace seems to have been settled by now. These rules apply to cyberspace. This is confirmed by numerous statements of States and by the outputs of the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing responsible State behaviour in cyberspace in the context of international security (‘UN GGE’) and the United Nations Open-Ended Working Group on Developments in the Field of ICTs in the Context of International Security (‘UN OEWG’). The 2013 consensus report of the third UN GGE noted in general terms that international law and, in particular, the UN Charter applies in cyberspace. The following 2015 and 2021 reports of the fourth and sixth UN GGEs made clear that the UN Charter ‘applies in its entirety’.\nHowever, there is still much uncertainty on exactly ‘how’ these rules apply. To give just\n4. Roscini, *Cyber Operations and the Use of Force* (n 2) 1–2; and already in Roscini, ‘World Wide Warfare’ (n 3) 86–87.\n5.

The UN GGE was established in 2002 by the UN Secretary-General at the request of the UN General Assembly, cf A/Res/56/19 (2002). Since 2004, six working groups have been convened, with the last one in 2019, cf 2004/2005 A/RES/58/32 (2003); 2009/2010 A/RES/60/45 (2006); 2012/2013 A/RES/66/24 (2011); 2014/2015 A/RES/68/243 (2014); 2016/2017 A/RES/70/237 (2015); 2019/2021 A/RES/73/266 (2019). The UN GGE reports to the UN General Assembly. The UN General Assembly considered and endorsed – by consensus – the 2010, 2013 and 2015 UN GGE reports, cf A/RES/65/41 (2011); A/RES/68/243 (2014); A/RES/70/237 (2015). Up until recently, the UN GGE was the primary inter-state forum for discussions on the legal regulation of cyberspace, cf Anders Henriksen, ‘The End of the Road for the UN GGE Process: The Future Regulation of Cyberspace’ (2019) 5 (1) *Journal of Cybersecurity*, 1; Martha Finnemore and Kathryn Sikkink, ‘International Norm Dynamics and Political Change’ (1998) 52 *International Organ* 887.

What kind of activities constitute an ‘armed attack’ and might give a State cause to invoke its inherent right to self-defence (Article 51 UN Charter)? Where along the spectrum of permissible to impermissible conduct do various types of cyber-attacks lie? How is mere cyber-criminality to be distinguished from warfare? Should we apply the so-called ‘scale and effects’ test according to which a cyberoperation constitutes a ‘use of force’ if its scale and effects are comparable to the scale and effects of a ‘traditional’ use of kinetic force? How can we attribute use of force in cyberspace? More generally, how do we apply rules that are based on the existence of geographical borders, over which States exercise sovereignty, to cyberspace, in which such borders are far from distinct?\nConsidering these open questions, it is all the more remarkable that many States shy away from actively contributing to the interpretative clarification of the law. They do not publish interpretative statements and do not make their practice of cyberwarfare public.\nPart 2 discusses the (in)activity of States to contribute to the interpretative clarification of ‘how’ jus contra bellum applies in cyberspace and discusses its negative repercussions for the work of the UN GGE and UN OEWG. Part 3 discusses possible explanations for the (legal) politics behind this interpretative silence. It argues that silence can be explained by a strategy of legal ambiguity, which finds its legal rationale in the traditional ‘freedom of State’ paradigm. The aim of this strategy is to keep the jus contra bellum in limbo and open scope for manoeuvre to cope with new technical developments and remaining strategic uncertainties in cyberwarfare.\nPart 4 discusses the (legal) consequences of interpretative silence and challenges its underlying rationale. The argument is that under the discursive framework provided by Articles 31–33 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (‘VCLT’), the interpretation – or non-interpretation – of the parties to a treaty remains a central factor to be taken into account. However, it is only by actively contributing to the clarification of the law that States ensure their voice is heard and avoid the risk that their silence is interpreted as acquiescence. Moreover, contrary to what the freedom of State paradigm implies, the subjective interpretation of the parties is not the only ‘game in town’. Articles 31–32 VCLT and other factors complement the subjective dimension of interpretation with an objective one. The less the ‘authentic’ interpretation of the parties leads to interpretative clarification, the more the other modes of interpretation come to the fore. As such, legal ambiguity is a misnomer for the lack of centralised interpretative authority in international law. Part 5 concludes.\n---\n Cf Initial ‘pre-draft’ of the report of the UN OEWG <https: 03=\"\" 200311-pre-draft-oewg-ict.pdf=\"\" 2020=\"\" unoda-web.s3.amazonaws.com=\"\" wp-content=\"\" uploads=\"\" wp=\"\"> (‘UN OEWG pre-draft’) [27].

Interpretative silence and jus contra bellum in cyberspace\n### 2.1 Jus contra bellum in cyberspace – a question of UN Charter interpretation\nThe present article presumes that questions concerning the application of *jus contra bellum* to cyberspace are first and foremost a matter of UN Charter interpretation. In the author’s view, the UN Charter-based *jus contra bellum* norms and their customary corollaries have merged into a single norm, even though the customary manifestation is based in a different source, and insofar remains conceptually independent from its treaty corollary. Article 103 UN Charter, which attaches supremacy to UN Charter law over other international law, also applies to customary international law. As such, customary derogation from the UN Charter based *jus contra bellum* is excluded.\nUnder what conditions an interpretation of UN Charter law amounts to a modification of the rules in question must not be conclusively discussed here. While further development of the Charter by consensual re-interpretation and customary application is possible, for the present purpose it is sufficient to keep in mind that it is not easily to be presumed that States want to circumvent the strict requirements for Charter amendments (Articles 108 and 109 UN Charter). There are, however, notable examples of informal UN Charter modification.\n### 2.2 Widespread interpretative silence\nConsidering the overall picture, we see that many States remain reluctant to clearly position themselves and contribute to a clarification of ‘how’ *jus contra bellum* applies in cyberspace. An increasing number of States have published ‘cyber security strategies’, and a growing number of States have also begun to publish statements on international law in cyberspace.\n---\n21.

However, some States continue to question whether the UN Charter provides a sufficient regulatory framework and whether Article 51 UN Charter (self-defence) also applies in cyberspace – despite the rather clear formulation in the 2013 and 2021 reports of the UN GGE that the UN Charter ‘applies in its entirety’. For example, Russia, China and Cuba reportedly opposed an explicit reference to the right to self-defence in the 2017 UN GGE report, which seems to have been a principal reason for the group’s failure to deliver a consensus report.

As such, Russia is a fierce advocate of a new international legal regime for cyberwarfare.\n## 2.3 The limited success of the UN GGE and UN OEWG\nThe UN GGE’s process has hitherto failed to contribute much to the clarification of ‘how’ *jus contra bellum* applies in cyberspace beyond the acknowledgment that the UN Charter applies ‘in its entirety’. Good arguments speak in favour of assuming that this failure is – at least to a certain extent – a consequence of the remaining unwillingness of many States to clarify their interpretative positions.\nAfter the failure of the first UN GGE (15 members) to deliver a final report, it was commonly agreed that the topic required further discussion. The second group of experts (again 15 members) eventually managed to reach an agreement on a short 2010 consensus report. However, this report only contained a few rudimentary findings and recommendations. It acknowledged the problem of attribution of cyberoperations and risk of potential threats, the ‘absence of a common understanding regarding acceptable State behaviour’, and more generally, the ‘lack of shared understanding regarding international norms pertaining to State use of ICTs’. Furthermore, it noted that ‘[e]xisting agreements include norms relevant to the use of ICTs by States’, that ‘additional norms could be developed over time’, and that the dialogue should continue.\nIn 2011, a third group of experts (again 15 members) was set up.

The third group submitted in 2013 a consensus report reemphasising the findings of the previous report. Importantly, the report noted for the first time explicitly that international law and in particular the UN Charter apply in cyberspace.\nIn December 2013, a fourth group of governmental experts was established, with their number increased to 20 members. The mandate of the fourth group included now specifically the question of ‘how’ international law applies in cyberspace. In 2015, the fourth group elaborated on some of the findings of the two previous UN GGE reports in a new consensus report. The group went further than the previous report by not only affirming in general terms that the UN Charter applies, but by explicitly noting that it ‘applies in its entirety’ and that States have an ‘inherent right …to take measures consistent with international law and as recognized in the Charter’. Moreover, it included explicit references to ‘the principles of humanity, necessity, proportionality and distinction’ and the obligation on States not to ‘use proxies to commit internationally wrongful acts using ICTs’ and to ‘ensure that their territory is not used by non-State actors to commit such acts’. Again, however, the report did not go into further detail and noted that there was a ‘need for further study on this matter’. In addition, the report included ‘recommendations for consideration by States for voluntary, non-binding norms, rules or principles of responsible behaviour of States aimed at promoting an open, secure, stable, accessible and peaceful ICT environment’. Many of these non-binding norms simply resemble what is already codified in international law as binding norms. As such, the report did not add much to the clarification of ‘how’ jus contra bellum applies in cyberspace.\nIn 2015, a fifth group of experts was established, again with an increased number of members (now 25). This time, however, the discussions proved even more difficult than in the previous rounds. In June 2017, the experts failed to agree on a draft for a consensus report. As previously mentioned, one explanation is that Cuba, China and Russia opposed the inclusion of references to the application of the right to self-defence (and the general international law principles of countermeasures and international humanitarian law).\n46. ibid.\n47.

The group delivered a report in 2021 and thus broke through the stalemate of the previous round. However, it did not add much in terms of substance to the clarification of the law. The report reaffirmed that international law, in particular the UN Charter ‘in its entirety’, applies in cyberspace (explicitly including the prohibition on the use of force) and noted again ‘the inherent right of States to take measures consistent with international law and as recognized in the Charter’.\nWhether the UN OEWG, as a more inclusive platform, will be more successful in clarifying the law remains to be seen. So far, the outcomes of the UN OEWG process have been rather limited. They do not go beyond the findings of the UN GGE. In its initial pre-draft from April 2020 and in its final substantive report from 10 March 2021, the UN OEWG noted that States reaffirmed the application of international law, and in particular UN Charter law, to cyberspace.\nIt would go too far to claim that the unwillingness of some States to publish their interpretations and to stay silent is the only reason for the failure of the UN GGE and the UN OEWG to provide more interpretative clarity. Interpretative activity may also lead to disagreement. However, interpretative engagement could have at least paved the way for finding common ground. This is also supported by the recommendations of the UN OEWG pre-draft and final reports, which emphasise the need for further information on the views and practice of States in relation to ‘how’ international law applies in cyberspace.\n# 3. The (legal) politics of silence\nHow can we explain the reluctance of States to refrain from submitting their legal positions on the interpretation of the jus contra bellum in cyberspace and the preference of some to foster new law-making instead of clarifying existing law? As States rarely explain the reasons for their silence, we can only speculate on their motives. A convincing explanation is that their choice for inactivity is driven by a preference for legal ambiguity, which finds its legal rationale in the traditional ‘freedom of State’ paradigm.\nThe discussion on the regulation of cyberwarfare is not only about the correct interpretation of the law but it ‘is as much about strategy, politics and ideological differences’. The interpretative approaches chosen by States often reflect their broader strategical interests, which coincide with their economic, military and technical capacities. Historically this has always been the case; the new reality of cyberwarfare has not changed this. How States interpret jus contra bellum in cyberspace is not independent of their respective ICT strengths and\n. A/RES/73/266 (2019).\n. A/76/135 (2021).\n. ibid [69] and [71(d)].\n.

Moreover, States' interpretations are influenced by their more fundamental ideological perspective on the openness of the internet.\nYet, how does the choice for staying silent fit in this picture? One possible explanation is that States wait for further technical developments before they formulate their own interpretative approaches. The speed and unpredictability of the development of new digital technologies create enormous strategic uncertainties. While economical resources and technical capacities are also of great importance in the context of cyberwarfare, the open structure of cyberspace seems to have re-shuffled many of the old certainties. Small States with a limited budget and little conventional military power can conduct military measures which have a large-scale effect in almost every corner of the world. Despite their strong conventional military powers, traditional strong military and economic powers feel increasingly vulnerable due to their strong digital connectedness. Against the background of these strategic uncertainties, it seems to be – at least at first glance – a rational choice for States to aim at paralysing legal clarification and perpetuating legal uncertainty, as they cannot sufficiently predict the long-term consequences of their own legal interpretation.\nFrom a legal-theoretical perspective, this choice of strategic ambiguity can only be explained by the traditional so-called ‘freedom of State’ paradigm. This state-oriented and subjective perspective paradigm considers the freedom and the will of States paramount. It found its most famous manifestation in the Lotus dictum of the Permanent Court of International Justice in 1927. The court held that\ninternational law governs relations between independent States. The rules of law binding upon States therefore emanate from their own free will as expressed in conventions or by usage generally accepted as expressing principles of law and established in order to regulate the relations between these co-existing independent communities or with a view to the achievement of common aims. Restrictions on the independence of States cannot therefore presumed.\nFrom this perspective, States are only bound by the extent to which they have consented to the rule of international law. Not only the formation of rules, but also their interpretation, follows this paradigm. In an earlier judgment, the PCIJ stated in relation to the interpretation of international law that ‘it is an established principle that the right of giving an authoritative interpretation of a legal rule belongs solely to the person or body who has power to modify or suppress it’. From this point of view, the freedom of State remains the residual rule. Indeterminacy plays into the hand of States.

If States remain silent, they remain free to do what they want.75\nAlternative explanations for interpretative silence do not convince. Disinterest in the topic seems a rather unlikely explanation, given the great relevance of cyber security in contemporary politics. Disagreement among different branches of the government is another possible explanation.76 However, this author is not aware of any such conflicts between different branches of the government within silent States. Coercion of less powerful States to remain silent due to certain power structures and dependencies in international politics (eg of military or economic nature) may also explain their silence. However, the author is not aware of any concrete cases. A final explanation could be that some States have voiced scepticism against the UN GGE. For example, Russia has referred to the UN GGE as ‘a narrow’ and ‘elitist’ expert platform and criticised the report of the UN OEWG for its linkage to the findings of the UN GGE.77 However, this attitude does not explain a general reluctance of States to position themselves outside of the UN GGE context, for example in the more inclusive forum of the UN OEWG.\n## 4. The (legal) consequence of interpretative silence\n## 4.1 States’ interpretation as ‘subsequent practice’\nTo start with the obvious: no State alone can determine the law with a binding effect for itself or for others by positively interpreting it or by not interpreting it. As Weiler and Haltern have argued, ‘autointerpretation, by each state individually, is mostly accepted as a practical inevitability with little, if any, normative value’.78 While States are usually the first and often also the last interpreters of the law (in the absence of delegation of interpretative authority, for example to an international court), it is wrong to claim that ‘each State establishes for itself its legal situation vis-à-vis other States’.79 To state otherwise would go against one of the cornerstones of the international legal order: the equality of States.80 Just as a single State\n75.

Does it matter that some States publish statements on the interpretation of the *jus contra bellum* in cyberspace whereas others refrain from doing so? Does the strategic inactivity leave the law in limbo?\n81.

As a general rule, an ‘agreement’ in the sense of Article 31(3)(a) or (b) must be ‘established’ and therefore it must be positively identifiable. A ‘subsequent agreement’ (lit a) must be clearly manifested (though not necessarily in written form) and *ipso facto* constitutes an ‘authentic interpretation’. For ‘subsequent practice’ (lit b), it must be shown that the understanding is common to the parties of the treaties by evincing a ‘particular conduct or circumstances’ through which an agreement can be identified indirectly. Therefore, ‘a subsequent agreement’ is typically easier to prove than a ‘subsequent practice’.\nA strict threshold of how many States must actively engage in a subsequent practice under lit b is difficult to establish. As a general rule, the value of the subsequent practice ‘depends on the extent to which it is concordant, common and consistent’. Here we can draw a parallel to the requirements of customary international law. ‘Subsequent practice’ under Article 31(3)(b) VCLT in essences equals practice under Article 38(1)(b) of the Statute of the International Court of Justice (ICJ Statute). The main difference is that, in the context of treaty interpretation, a ‘specific’ practice of the parties to the treaty rather than a ‘general’ practice is required. The ICJ made clear that the practice of States (accompanied by the required *opinio juris*) needs to be sufficiently general for formation of a rule of customary international law. It must be ‘extensive’, ‘sufficiently widespread’ and ‘broadly representative’, in particular by those States whose interests are ‘specially affected’. This means that it is not required to prove a positive practice of all parties at all times. There is no strict standard on the exact number of States’ practices that must be positively proven.\n.

It can be sufficient to show that ‘[s]ome States actively create a practice, some by initiating it, some by imitating it, and others by acquiescing in it. Other States may have done nothing, but find themselves bound by the emerging rule’.\nFrom this follows that relevant silence may be considered a confirmation of the developing interpretative ‘agreement’. Under what circumstance it does so, however, remains a much-contested issue in international legal practice and scholarship.\nThe first question is: what kind of behaviour qualifies as silence? A clear case of silence is given if a State does not express itself at all in relation to the interpretation of a treaty and any of its provisions. Such behaviour qualifies as a verbal omission and therefore silence. Generally, statements on the non-application of a treaty or a rule may qualify as relevant ‘subsequent practice’ and do not constitute silence. A sufficient detailedness of the interpretative statement is not required. Inconsistent subsequent practice can be precluded from having a normative effect under the principle of estoppel. Hence, claims by some States that Article 51 UN Charter does not apply in cyberspace are devoid of normative effect, if these States have earlier acknowledged that the UN Charter applies in cyberspace.\nThe second question is whether the State’s intention to confirm a certain interpretation through its silence is decisive or whether we should apply objective criteria and rely on the recipient’s perspective. In a nutshell, voluntarists argue that States’ silence only has the legal effect that conforms to the will of the silent State. For those who support an objective\n107.

For example, Starski argues that ‘silence will never reveal the true beliefs of an actor: “belief” will necessarily be constructed merely from the contextual setting’. In addition, she suggests that international law imposes on States a ‘legislative responsibility’ to engage in active interpretation if the circumstances have called for some reaction to ensure international law’s effectivity and legal certainty. This ‘legislative responsibility’ is only a soft obligation (in German ‘Obliegenheit’, which can be translated into ‘incumbency’) that is not enforceable and sanctionable. Attaching legal effect to States’ silence is a compensation for the ‘soft’ character of this ‘legislative responsibility’. In Starski’s view, such responsibility follows inter alia from a ‘constitutionalist’ reading of international law. In her view, the ‘eminent’ role of States in the process of law creation and evolution ‘endows states with a specific responsibility towards the effectivity of the international legal system’ which depends on a clarification of the law. Only determinacy makes norms operational and allows us to distinguish law from non-law.\nStarski’s argument has merits for several reasons. To start with, the principle of good faith reflected in Article 31(1) VCLT requires States to fulfil their obligation as parties to a treaty, not to impede the effect of the treaty by perpetuating indeterminacy (under certain circumstances, as discussed below).\nWhile a ‘constitutionalist’ reading of international law invoked by Starski comes with challenges, the ‘legislative responsibility takes account of the shift from a purely State-oriented international legal order of co-existence towards a legal order of cooperation that does not only serve States’ interests but also interests of an alleged ‘international commu\nGeneral Principles and Sources of Law’ (1953) 30 British Year Book of International Law 1, 68; Jacques Bentz, ‘Le silence comme manifestation de volonté en Droit international public’ (1963) 67 Revue Général de Droit International Public 44, 45.\n116.

As the ILC noted, ‘acceptance of a practice by one or more parties by way of silence or inaction is not easily established’. In order to find a fair balance between the objectification of silence and consensualist concerns, a close scrutiny of the context and setting of the silence is required. The important qualification is that we can infer consent from silence only – independent of the real intention of the State – if the ‘circumstances were such as called for some reaction’. Only if she must and can speak (*si loqui debuisset ac potuisset*), the neutral maxim that ‘she who keeps silent is held neither to deny nor to accept’ (*qui tacit neque negat, neque utique fatetur*) yields to the maxim that ‘she who keeps silent is held to consent’ (*qui tacit consentire videtur*).\nThe ILC has pointed to two factors that must be considered to establish whether the circumstances ‘called for some reaction’: ‘the legal situation to which the subsequent practice by the other party relates and the claim thereby expressed’. If we break down these two broad criteria into more specific sub-criteria, we can identify nine factors that should be taken into account.\nThe first factor that should be considered is the nature of the State practice itself. It is relevant whether the interpretative action was a singular event or whether it occurred frequently. Moreover, it is relevant whether the interpretative action is consistent and whether it has become commonplace. In this context, the element of time must also be considered: the longer States engage in a certain action, the higher the expectation is that other States react.\n127.

Only if the State claims that its conduct is in conformity with the law can a reaction by other States be legitimately expected. However, this is often difficult to establish in practice.\nThe third factor is whether the silent State was aware (which would be difficult to prove) or 'ought to have been aware' of the conduct of the other State. Moreover, the State must have had the capacity to act.\nThe fourth factor that needs to be included in the assessment is the context in which the relevant claim was made. The more internationally significant a context is, the more it can be expected that States react to claims made in this context. For example, UN organs constitute a highly significant context for claims made in relation to the interpretation of the UN Charter. The more volatile a rule is (either due to ongoing discourses over its meaning, or due to its generally vague character), the more it is expected that States react to claims made by other States. Power relations between States (eg of military or economic nature) must only be considered under certain exceptional circumstances (such as fraud, corruption or threat or coercion by the threat or use of force).\nThe fifth factor concerns the reactions of other actors. If we find ourselves in a situation of accelerating interpretative discourse (indicating increased normative volatility), there can be a higher expectation that 'bystanders' react.\nThe sixth factor to be considered is the impact of the proposed interpretation on rights and interests of States. The more the rights and interests of the State are affected, the more a reaction can be expected. Good arguments, however, speak in favour of not automatically inferring acquiescence in relation to the interpretation of *jus contra bellum*, even though as *erga omnes* obligations the *jus contra bellum* rules embody the interests of the whole international community, which includes every State.

As Starski convincingly argues,\n[t]he very purpose of erga omnes norms would appear to be undermined if the non-protest of bystander states in light of their violation might more easily have a law-altering effect than in the case of ‘ordinary’ rules. ... The erga omnes dimension of norms creates a – rather fictitious – locus standi, but only to the benefit of a norm’s enforceability and not in order to enhance its alterability.\nThe eighth factor to be considered is ‘timeliness’. The greater the impact of the proposed interpretation is on interests and rights of a State, the more it is to be expected that it responds in a timely manner.\nThe ninth and final factor concerns the nature of the affected rules in question. If the rule in question enjoys a jus cogens or erga omnes status, the threshold for modification is set high. Jus cogens norms require a near-universal State practice and can only be substituted by a norm of the same nature (Article 53 VCLT). As such, silence ‘can only under very limited circumstances issue law formative effects in cases in which peremptory norms are at stake if the very concept of jus cogens is to be kept doctrinally intact’.\nIf we apply these standards to the practice of States to the discourse on jus contra bellum in cyberspace, it seems premature to conclude that the silence of States that have not engaged with interpretative proposals made by other States amounts to acquiescence in all contexts.\nTo give one illustrative example: many of those States that have published interpretative statements have endorsed the so-called ‘scale and effects’ test (or a version thereof) that is based on the Nicaragua judgment of the ICJ. Under the ‘scale and effects’ test, a cyber-operation constitutes a ‘use of force’ if its scale and effects are comparable to the scale and effects of a ‘traditional’ use of kinetic force.\nDoes the silence of some States on whether they agree with this interpretation of the law amount to legally relevant acquiescence? Were the circumstances such that they called for some reaction according to the aforementioned standards?\nSeveral of those standards are met. Mere verbal and written statements may constitute relevant ‘subsequent practice’. Article 31(3)(b) VCLT does not require a physical action as\n(commentaries on Articles 48(1)(a) and 48(1)(b)).

The claims relating to the ‘scale’ and ‘effect’ are meant to provide an interpretation of the law and not an explanation of unlawful behaviour (second factor). The silent States had the capacity to act and were (or at least ought to be) aware of these interpretative statements (third factor). The statements were made in internationally significant contexts, such as before the UN GGE and UN OEWG, or through official channels, including homepages of ministries of foreign affairs, or other public fora (fourth factor). The jus contra bellum also consists of rules that are by their very nature volatile (fifth factor).\nHowever, if we look at the other relevant factors, it seems doubtful that the circumstances were already such that they called for some reaction. Arguably, the interpretative statements in relation to the ‘scale’ and ‘effect’ test are not sufficiently consistent and widespread (first factor). While there seems to be an agreement on the overall contours of this test and its applicability in cyberspace, there still seems disagreement on its precise scope, for example in relation to the question of whether cyber-operations causing severe non-physical consequences, such as an attack on the nation’s economic system, may also reach the threshold of a use of force. Several States seem to be in favour of this interpretation. Others, however, seem to be sceptical or leave this question open. It also seems doubtful that a sufficient number of States have publicly subscribed to an application of this test. The subsequent practice must be ‘extensive’ and ‘sufficiently widespread’ and ‘broadly representative’ among States, in particular those whose interests are ‘specially affected’. While the number of States supporting this test is relatively large and seems to be growing, it does not comprise the majority of UN Member States yet. However, it is not unlikely that the relevant threshold will be met in the future, which would increase the expectation of reactions of bystanders.\nMoreover, most States who have begun to position themselves in favour of an application of the ‘scale’ and ‘effect’ in cyberspace test have done so only quite recently (first and eighth factor). The UN OEWG process, in whose context many States have made their statements, has also been only established relatively recently. However, the longer the UN OEWG process is ongoing, the higher the expectation is that other States react to interpretative proposals.\nAs the interpretative proposals relate to the UN Charter and potentially impact rights and interests of all States, one could argue that a reaction can be expected (sixth factor). On the other hand, as has been discussed above, the fact that the UN Charter jus contra bellum rules constitute erga omnes obligations and jus cogens speaks against inferring too easily\n162.

If the rule in question enjoys a *jus cogens* or *erga omnes* status, the threshold for a conclusive interpretation is set very high.\nIn conclusion, good arguments speak in favour of not (yet) qualifying the silence as acquiescence to interpretations that support the ‘scale’ and ‘effect’ test. However, these findings are only a snapshot of the current situation. The more a common position crystallises among a sufficient number of states on the interpretation of the *jus contra bellum* in cyberspace (or specific elements thereof), the more that silent States need to position themselves to avoid their silence being interpreted as acquiescence.\nMoreover, as discussed in the next section, the lack of an interpretative agreement on the ‘scale’ and ‘effect’ test does not necessarily leave the law in limbo as objective interpretative factors must also be considered. International lawyers are justified in making an argument in favour of applying the ‘scale’ and ‘effect’ test to cyberspace on the basis of the wording, objective and purpose of the UN Charter, in light of ICJ jurisprudence (Article 38(1)(d) ICJ Statute).\n## 4.3 The interplay between subjective and objective factors in UN Charter interpretation\nContrary to what the freedom of State paradigm implies, the subjective interpretation of the parties of ‘how’ the UN Charter *jus contra bellum* applies in cyberspace is not the sole factor at play. The subjective interpretation of States is complemented by objective factors, including the ‘ordinary meaning’ of the terms of the treaty (Article 31(1) VCLT), the treaty’s ‘context’ and ‘object and purpose’ (Article 31(1) VCLT), agreements and instruments made with the conclusion of the treaty (Article 31(2) VCLT), and other ‘relevant rules of international law applicable in relations between the parties’ (Article 31(3)(c) VCLT). In treaty interpretation, subjective and objective factors do not stand in a hierarchical relationship with each other; their order merely represents the logical process of interpretation. Subsequent practice is often used in interplay with the other means of interpretation in a ‘single combined operation’. At least, this observation holds true with regard to the practice of the ICJ.\nThe complementary interplay of subjective and objective elements in the interpretation of treaties that follows from Article 31 VLCT takes account of the shift from a purely State-oriented international legal order of co-existence towards a legal order of cooperation that has been discussed above. While the traditional bilateral structure remains the basis to avoid international law sliding into utopianism, treaties have a normative force that is independent from States’ will.\n---\n.

In such circumstances, a non-liquet would have to be declared. It would not be possible to determine the meaning of a provision.\nWhile it would go beyond the scope of the present paper to comprehensively discuss the possibility of gaps in the law, a few remarks should suffice. Although we find instances where courts have accepted a non-liquet, judicial practice and scholarship are generally not willing to do so. International rules are per se shrouded by uncertainty and indeterminacy (as any legal rules). Allowing non-liquet would question the very functionality and effectiveness of international law. The judicial function of judges requires that they concretise norms and provide definite answers to legal questions. The plurality of subjective and objective interpretative tools offered by Articles 31–32 VCLT strongly support the view that non-liquet should not be assumed. Important in this context is Article 31(3)(1) VCLT, which provides a pathway of general principles of international law into every interpretative exercise. General principles’ main function is filling gaps in the law, that is, to avoid lacunae left by the (application of the) other sources of international law.\nWhile the strategic inactivity of many States to publish their practice undoubtedly has negative consequences for the clarification of the jus contra bellum, it does not leave the law in limbo. The law stands despite the relative lack of States’ contribution to its clarification. Even if States establish a subsequent interpretative agreement in the sense of Article 31(1)(a) or (b) VCLT, such an agreement is only one factor among others that must be considered.\n## 4.5 The role of courts, organs of international organisations and the ILC and the lack of centralised interpretative authority\nAgainst this background, legal ambiguity in the present context is not the consequence of a gap in the law that follows from the interpretative silence of states; rather, it is a misnomer for the lack of centralised interpretative authority in international law. States are not the only relevant actors in the interpretation of international law. A number of institutional actors could potentially play an important role in the normative discourse on ‘how’ jus contra bellum applies in cyberspace, such as international courts and tribunals, organs of international organisations (most importantly UN organs), and the International Law Commission (ILC). However, none of these institutional actors has been equipped with the centralised authority to decide what the correct interpretation of the law is. As such, the clarification of the law is left to an open-ended discursive process.\n---\n. *Non liquet* transl. ‘it is not clear’.\n.

However, in matters of *jus contra bellum* in cyberspace, international courts and tribunals often lack the jurisdiction to provide interpretative clarification. Even though the ICJ had for a while a considerable number of cases (directly or indirectly) concerning the use of force before it, this trend has not continued, and most of the cases did not make it to the merits. Importantly for us, the Court has not dealt with questions concerning *jus contra bellum* in cyberspace and it is not likely that it will do so in the near future; other courts or tribunals that may take up the issues are also not in sight.\nWhile the UN GGE played a significant role as a facilitator of normative discourse, it has never been a platform that could have authoritatively determined the correct interpretation of the *jus contra bellum*. The UN GGE was not invested with the power to create new international law. The reports of the UN GGE do not set legal norms themselves. Even if one supports the view that the practice of organs or sub-organs of international organisations may be directly relevant under Article 31–32 VCLT, for example as relevant ‘subsequent practice’, good arguments speak against attaching significant weight to the practice of the UN GGE. The reports only represent the views of experts of a limited number of States (initially 15, now 25). What matters is the reception by all parties to the UN Charter and other international organs of the UN, such as the UN GA.\nThe UN GA may take up issues on *jus contra bellum* in cyberspace and has done so, for example by ‘taking note’ of the assessments and recommendations of the two first UN GGE reports (2010 and 2013) and by ‘welcoming’ the ‘conclusions’ of the third UN GGE report (2015, without a vote, meaning by consensus). However, rather than constituting a centralised form of interpretation, the UN GA practice reflects the cumulative practice of individual States.\n---\n On the role of ‘judicial decisions’ as ‘subsidiary means, see Mads Andenas and Johann R Leiss, ‘The Systemic Relevance of “Judicial Decisions” in International Law’ (2017) 77 Zeitschrift für ausländisches öffentliches Recht und Völkerrecht 907, 934–935.\n Cf Christine Gray, ‘The Use and Abuse of the International Court of Justice: Cases concerning the Use of Force after Nicaragua’ (2003) 14 European Journal of International Law 867.

However, to date the UN Security Council has not taken up the issue. Moreover, UN Security Council resolutions do not represent an authoritative interpretation of the UN Charter that binds States beyond the individual case and often require further interpretation by the member States of the UN.\nThe ILC is another institution that potentially plays a role in clarifying (and even developing) the jus contra bellum in cyberspace. However, the suggestion to refer the issue to the ILC that was included in the initial pre-draft report of the OEWG was met by scepticism of several States. They consider it premature to involve the ILC at this stage, since the practice of States is as yet too scarce for the ILC to carry out a meaningful analysis.\nFor the future, however, it cannot be excluded that these actors will contribute to crystallisation of the ‘correct’ interpretation of the law. While their interpretation must (also) be grounded in the will of States, they will mainly process positive manifestations of those States that have actively made their position clear or, in the absence of a clearly identifiable common and consistent practice, have recourse to the objective means of interpretation.\n# 5. Conclusion\nThis article has discussed the politics and legal rationale behind the reluctance of some States to help clarify ‘how’ jus contra bellum applies in cyberspace. It has shown that interpretative silence may backfire in the long run. States’ silence may be interpreted – though only under strict conditions – as acquiescence to an emerging, widely accepted interpretation of the law. Moreover, objective factors beyond the subjective interpretation of States may come to the fore if too many States remain silent and thereby prevent the crystallisation of a sufficiently widely accepted interpretation of the law.\nIn light of these findings, initiatives that encourage States to make their positions publicly available are to be welcomed from a rule of law perspective. They are also in States’ own interests. The vital role of the jus contra bellum rules for the maintenance of peace and security requires interpretative clarity to ensure their efficiency and transparency.

Moreover, interpretation and development of the law would be left to military considerations that all too easily exclude other concerns.\nWhether these calls for more interpretative activity will make the UN OEWG process more successful than the UN GGE remains to be seen. It is more inclusive than the UN GGE and allows more States to be heard. However, the first impression does not seem very promising. The UN OEWG’s initial pre-draft and final report have not added anything substantive to the work of the UN GGE in matters of jus contra bellum in cyberspace.196\nIf the global dialogue on jus contra bellum in cyberspace remains unsuccessful, it seems likely that the path will steer away from global initiatives towards regional processes among like-minded states or even bilateral agreements.197 The US has already indicated that they would consider focusing on ‘likeminded partners’ to tackle cybersecurity issues.198 Likewise, Russia increasingly turns towards the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO).199 Other regional platforms are also becoming involved in cybersecurity issues, such as the Organization of American States, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Regional Forum, the Economic Community of West African States, the African Union, the European Union,200 the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe,201 and the Council of Europe.\nWhile the greater involvement of regional processes in the normative discourse is not a bad thing per se, the universal character of the UN Charter requires universal solutions to avoid ‘fragmentation of the international norms discourse’.202\n## Acknowledgment\nWork on this paper has been conducted under the aegis of the project ‘Security in Internet Governance and Networks: Analysing the Law’ (SIGNAL), funded by the Norwegian Research Council and UNINETT Norid AS.

JOHANN RUBEN LEISS Absence of interpretation of some States does not necessarily stall the establishment of the authentic interpretation of the treaty provision in question. As a general rule, an ‘agreement’ in the sense of Article 31(3)(a) or (b) must be ‘established’ and therefore it must be positively identifiable.⁹¹ A ‘subsequent agreement’ (lit a) must be clearly manifested (though not necessarily in written form) and *ipso facto* constitutes an ‘authentic interpretation’.⁹² For ‘subsequent practice’ (lit b), it must be shown that the understanding is common to the parties of the treaties by evincing a ‘particular conduct or circumstances’ through which an agreement can be identified indirectly.⁹³ Therefore, ‘a subsequent agreement’ is typically easier to prove than a ‘subsequent practice’.⁹⁴ A strict threshold of how many States must actively engage in a subsequent practice under lit b is difficult to establish.⁹⁵ As a general rule, the value of the subsequent practice ‘depends on the extent to which it is concordant, common and consistent’.⁹⁶ Here we can draw a parallel to the requirements of customary international law. ‘Subsequent practice’ under Article 31(3)(b) VCLT in essences equals practice under Article 38(1)(b) of the Statute of the International Court of Justice (ICJ Statute)⁹⁷.⁹⁸ The main difference is that, in the context of treaty interpretation, a ‘specific’ practice of the parties to the treaty rather than a ‘general’ practice is required.⁹⁹ The ICJ made clear that the practice of States (accompanied by the required *opinio juris*) needs to be sufficiently general for formation of a rule of customary international law.¹⁰⁰ It must be ‘extensive’,¹⁰¹ ‘sufficiently widespread’¹⁰² and ‘broadly representative’,¹⁰³ in particular by those States whose interests are ‘specially affected’.¹⁰⁴ This means that it is not required to prove a positive practice of all parties at all times.¹⁰⁵ There is no strict standard on the exact number of States’ practices that must be positively proven.¹⁰⁶ ⁹¹.

OSLO LAW REVIEW | VOLUME 9 | No.1-2022 39 As the ICJ held in the case concerning the Temple of Preah Vihear, ‘where it is clear that the circumstances were such as called for some reaction, within a reasonable period’, the State that is confronted with a certain subsequent practice by another party and does not react ‘must be held to have acquiesced’.¹⁰⁷ It can be sufficient to show that ‘[s]ome States actively create a practice, some by initiating it, some by imitating it, and others by acquiescing in it. Other States may have done nothing, but find themselves bound by the emerging rule’.¹⁰⁸ From this follows that relevant silence may be considered a confirmation of the developing interpretative ‘agreement’.¹⁰⁹ Under what circumstance it does so, however, remains a much-contested issue in international legal practice and scholarship.¹¹⁰ The first question is: what kind of behaviour qualifies as silence? A clear case of silence is given if a State does not express itself at all in relation to the interpretation of a treaty and any of its provisions. Such behaviour qualifies as a verbal omission and therefore silence.¹¹¹ Generally, statements on the non-application of a treaty or a rule may qualify as relevant ‘subsequent practice’ and do not constitute silence.¹¹² A sufficient detailedness of the interpretative statement is not required. Inconsistent subsequent practice can be precluded from having a normative effect under the principle of estoppel.¹¹³ Hence, claims by some States that Article 51 UN Charter does not apply in cyberspace are devoid of normative effect, if these States have earlier acknowledged that the UN Charter applies in cyberspace. The second question is whether the State’s intention to confirm a certain interpretation through its silence is decisive or whether we should apply objective criteria and rely on the recipient’s perspective.¹¹⁴ In a nutshell, voluntarists argue that States’ silence only has the legal effect that conforms to the will of the silent State.¹¹⁵ For those who support an objective"

(EUI), Associate Professor, Inland Norway University of Applied Science (Lillehammer) and Associate Professor II, University of Oslo\njohann.leiss@inn.no\n## Abstract\nThis article explores the (in)activity of many States in contributing to the interpretative clarification of 'how' jus contra bellum applies in cyberspace, its negative repercussions for the work of the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing responsible State behaviour in cyberspace in the context of international security (UN GGE) and the United Nations Open-Ended Working Group on Developments in the Field of ICTs in the Context of International Security (UN OEWG), and the way forward. In its main part, the article analyses the (legal) consequences of interpretative silence and challenges its (presumably) underlying rationale – that is, a strategy of legal ambiguity based on the traditional 'freedom of State' paradigm. This article argues that it is only by actively contributing to the clarification of the law that States ensure their voice is heard and avoid the risk that their silence is interpreted as acquiescence. Moreover, contrary to what the freedom of State paradigm implies, the subjective interpretation of the parties is not the only 'game in town'. If no interpretative agreement of States crystallises, the interpretation of jus contra bellum is determined by objective factors. The article concludes by arguing that from a rule of law perspective, States should be encouraged to express their views on 'how' jus contra bellum applies in cyberspace to ensure the efficiency and transparency of these rules, which constitute part of the backbone of a peaceful co-existence and cooperation between states.\n## Keywords\njus contra bellum, cyberwarfare, treaty interpretation, acquiescence, UN GGE, UN OEWG\n## 1. Introduction\nAmong the great challenges to international law posed by the digitisation of our modern world is the fact that modern warfare has expanded into cyberspace.¹ As with any technical developments in human history, warfare has taken up new digital technologies.² Modern armies have the capability to cause death and destruction via cyberspace. At the same time, societies have become increasingly vulnerable.³ Much critical infrastructure is digitalised,\n1.

These rules apply to cyberspace.¹¹ This is confirmed by numerous statements of States and by the outputs of the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing responsible State behaviour in cyberspace in the context of international security (‘UN GGE’)¹² and the United Nations Open-Ended Working Group on Developments in the Field of ICTs in the Context of International Security (‘UN OEWG’).¹³ The 2013 consensus report of the third UN GGE noted in general terms that international law and, in particular, the UN Charter applies in cyberspace.¹⁴ The following 2015 and 2021 reports of the fourth and sixth UN GGEs made clear that the UN Charter ‘applies in its entirety’.¹⁵\nHowever, there is still much uncertainty on exactly ‘how’ these rules apply.¹⁶ To give just\n4.

Today, *jus ad bellum* is increasingly referred to as *jus contra bellum*, cf Olivier Corten, *The Law Against War: The Prohibition on the Use of Force in Contemporary International Law* (Hart 2012) passim; Delerue (n 1) 275. Note that this article is concerned with *jus contra bellum* issues but not *jus in bello* issues, the latter referring to the question of how the laws of war would govern the use of cyber-attacks during an ongoing armed conflict.\n10. Charter of the United Nations (opened for signature 26 June 1945, entered into force 24 October 1945) 3 Bevans 1153. The *jus contra bellum* also includes Chapter 7, Article 42 UN Charter, which deals with UN Security Council authorization.\n11. Cf Delerue (n 1) 1–2.\n12. The UN GGE was established in 2002 by the UN Secretary-General at the request of the UN General Assembly, cf A/Res/56/19 (2002). Since 2004, six working groups have been convened, with the last one in 2019, cf 2004/2005 A/RES/58/32 (2003); 2009/2010 A/RES/60/45 (2006); 2012/2013 A/RES/66/24 (2011); 2014/2015 A/RES/68/243 (2014); 2016/2017 A/RES/70/237 (2015); 2019/2021 A/RES/73/266 (2019). The UN GGE reports to the UN General Assembly. The UN General Assembly considered and endorsed – by consensus – the 2010, 2013 and 2015 UN GGE reports, cf A/RES/65/41 (2011); A/RES/68/243 (2014); A/RES/70/237 (2015). Up until recently, the UN GGE was the primary inter-state forum for discussions on the legal regulation of cyberspace, cf Anders Henriksen, ‘The End of the Road for the UN GGE Process: The Future Regulation of Cyberspace’ (2019) 5 (1) *Journal of Cybersecurity*, 1; Martha Finnemore and Kathryn Sikkink, ‘International Norm Dynamics and Political Change’ (1998) 52 *International Organ* 887.

The UN OEWG was established in 2018 as a second UN forum for the discussion of the regulation of cyberspace, A/RES/73/27 (2018).

What kind of activities constitute an ‘armed attack’ and might give a State cause to invoke its inherent right to self-defence (Article 51 UN Charter)?¹⁷ Where along the spectrum of permissible to impermissible conduct do various types of cyber-attacks lie? How is mere cyber-criminality to be distinguished from warfare? Should we apply the so-called ‘scale and effects’ test according to which a cyberoperation constitutes a ‘use of force’ if its scale and effects are comparable to the scale and effects of a ‘traditional’ use of kinetic force? How can we attribute use of force in cyberspace?¹⁸ More generally, how do we apply rules that are based on the existence of geographical borders, over which States exercise sovereignty, to cyberspace, in which such borders are far from distinct?¹⁹\nConsidering these open questions, it is all the more remarkable that many States shy away from actively contributing to the interpretative clarification of the law. They do not publish interpretative statements and do not make their practice of cyberwarfare public.\nPart 2 discusses the (in)activity of States to contribute to the interpretative clarification of ‘how’ jus contra bellum applies in cyberspace and discusses its negative repercussions for the work of the UN GGE and UN OEWG. Part 3 discusses possible explanations for the (legal) politics behind this interpretative silence. It argues that silence can be explained by a strategy of legal ambiguity, which finds its legal rationale in the traditional ‘freedom of State’ paradigm. The aim of this strategy is to keep the jus contra bellum in limbo and open scope for manoeuvre to cope with new technical developments and remaining strategic uncertainties in cyberwarfare.\nPart 4 discusses the (legal) consequences of interpretative silence and challenges its underlying rationale. The argument is that under the discursive framework provided by Articles 31–33 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (‘VCLT’)²⁰, the interpretation – or non-interpretation – of the parties to a treaty remains a central factor to be taken into account. However, it is only by actively contributing to the clarification of the law that States ensure their voice is heard and avoid the risk that their silence is interpreted as acquiescence. Moreover, contrary to what the freedom of State paradigm implies, the subjective interpretation of the parties is not the only ‘game in town’. Articles 31–32 VCLT and other factors complement the subjective dimension of interpretation with an objective one. The less the ‘authentic’ interpretation of the parties leads to interpretative clarification, the more the other modes of interpretation come to the fore. As such, legal ambiguity is a misnomer for the lack of centralised interpretative authority in international law. Part 5 concludes.\n---\n¹⁷ Cf Initial ‘pre-draft’ of the report of the UN OEWG <https: 03=\"\" 200311-pre-draft-oewg-ict.pdf=\"\" 2020=\"\" unoda-web.s3.amazonaws.com=\"\" wp-content=\"\" uploads=\"\" wp=\"\"> (‘UN OEWG pre-draft’) .

Interpretative silence and jus contra bellum in cyberspace\n### 2.1 Jus contra bellum in cyberspace – a question of UN Charter interpretation\nThe present article presumes that questions concerning the application of *jus contra bellum* to cyberspace are first and foremost a matter of UN Charter interpretation. In the author’s view, the UN Charter-based *jus contra bellum* norms and their customary corollaries have merged into a single norm,²¹ even though the customary manifestation is based in a different source, and insofar remains conceptually independent from its treaty corollary.²² Article 103 UN Charter, which attaches supremacy to UN Charter law over other international law, also applies to customary international law.²³ As such, customary derogation from the UN Charter based *jus contra bellum* is excluded.\nUnder what conditions an interpretation of UN Charter law amounts to a modification of the rules in question must not be conclusively discussed here. While further development of the Charter by consensual re-interpretation and customary application is possible,²⁴ for the present purpose it is sufficient to keep in mind that it is not easily to be presumed that States want to circumvent the strict requirements for Charter amendments (Articles 108 and 109 UN Charter).²⁵ There are, however, notable examples of informal UN Charter modification.²⁶\n### 2.2 Widespread interpretative silence\nConsidering the overall picture, we see that many States remain reluctant to clearly position themselves and contribute to a clarification of ‘how’ *jus contra bellum* applies in cyberspace.²⁷ An increasing number of States have published ‘cyber security strategies’,²⁸ and a growing number of States have also begun to publish statements on international law in cyberspace.²⁹\n---\n21.

It acknowledged the problem of attribution of cyberoperations and risk of potential threats, the ‘absence of a common understanding regarding acceptable State behaviour’, and more generally, the ‘lack of shared understanding regarding international norms pertaining to State use of ICTs’.⁴³ Furthermore, it noted that ‘[e]xisting agreements include norms relevant to the use of ICTs by States’, that ‘additional norms could be developed over time’, and that the dialogue should continue.⁴⁴\nIn 2011, a third group of experts (again 15 members) was set up.⁴⁵ This time the mandate of the group specifically asked not only for a discussion of ‘international concepts aimed at\n37.

As such, the report did not add much to the clarification of ‘how’ jus contra bellum applies in cyberspace.⁵⁶\nIn 2015, a fifth group of experts was established, again with an increased number of members (now 25).⁵⁷ This time, however, the discussions proved even more difficult than in the previous rounds. In June 2017, the experts failed to agree on a draft for a consensus report.⁵⁸ As previously mentioned, one explanation is that Cuba, China and Russia opposed the inclusion of references to the application of the right to self-defence (and the general international law principles of countermeasures and international humanitarian law).⁵⁹\n46. ibid.\n47.

The report reaffirmed that international law, in particular the UN Charter ‘in its entirety’, applies in cyberspace (explicitly including the prohibition on the use of force) and noted again ‘the inherent right of States to take measures consistent with international law and as recognized in the Charter’.⁶²\nWhether the UN OEWG, as a more inclusive platform, will be more successful in clarifying the law remains to be seen. So far, the outcomes of the UN OEWG process have been rather limited. They do not go beyond the findings of the UN GGE.⁶³ In its initial pre-draft from April 2020⁶⁴ and in its final substantive report from 10 March 2021,⁶⁵ the UN OEWG noted that States reaffirmed the application of international law, and in particular UN Charter law, to cyberspace.\nIt would go too far to claim that the unwillingness of some States to publish their interpretations and to stay silent is the only reason for the failure of the UN GGE and the UN OEWG to provide more interpretative clarity. Interpretative activity may also lead to disagreement. However, interpretative engagement could have at least paved the way for finding common ground. This is also supported by the recommendations of the UN OEWG pre-draft and final reports, which emphasise the need for further information on the views and practice of States in relation to ‘how’ international law applies in cyberspace.⁶⁶\n# 3. The (legal) politics of silence\nHow can we explain the reluctance of States to refrain from submitting their legal positions on the interpretation of the jus contra bellum in cyberspace and the preference of some to foster new law-making instead of clarifying existing law? As States rarely explain the reasons for their silence, we can only speculate on their motives. A convincing explanation is that their choice for inactivity is driven by a preference for legal ambiguity, which finds its legal rationale in the traditional ‘freedom of State’ paradigm.\nThe discussion on the regulation of cyberwarfare is not only about the correct interpretation of the law but it ‘is as much about strategy, politics and ideological differences’.⁶⁷ The interpretative approaches chosen by States often reflect their broader strategical interests, which coincide with their economic, military and technical capacities.⁶⁸ Historically this has always been the case; the new reality of cyberwarfare has not changed this. How States interpret jus contra bellum in cyberspace is not independent of their respective ICT strengths and\n⁶⁰. A/RES/73/266 (2019).\n⁶¹. A/76/135 (2021).\n⁶². ibid  and [71(d)].\n⁶³.

One possible explanation is that States wait for further technical developments before they formulate their own interpretative approaches. The speed and unpredictability of the development of new digital technologies create enormous strategic uncertainties.⁷¹ While economical resources and technical capacities are also of great importance in the context of cyberwarfare, the open structure of cyberspace seems to have re-shuffled many of the old certainties. Small States with a limited budget and little conventional military power can conduct military measures which have a large-scale effect in almost every corner of the world. Despite their strong conventional military powers, traditional strong military and economic powers feel increasingly vulnerable due to their strong digital connectedness. Against the background of these strategic uncertainties, it seems to be – at least at first glance – a rational choice for States to aim at paralysing legal clarification and perpetuating legal uncertainty, as they cannot sufficiently predict the long-term consequences of their own legal interpretation.⁷²\nFrom a legal-theoretical perspective, this choice of strategic ambiguity can only be explained by the traditional so-called ‘freedom of State’ paradigm. This state-oriented and subjective perspective paradigm considers the freedom and the will of States paramount. It found its most famous manifestation in the Lotus dictum of the Permanent Court of International Justice in 1927. The court held that\ninternational law governs relations between independent States. The rules of law binding upon States therefore emanate from their own free will as expressed in conventions or by usage generally accepted as expressing principles of law and established in order to regulate the relations between these co-existing independent communities or with a view to the achievement of common aims. Restrictions on the independence of States cannot therefore presumed.⁷³\nFrom this perspective, States are only bound by the extent to which they have consented to the rule of international law. Not only the formation of rules, but also their interpretation, follows this paradigm. In an earlier judgment, the PCIJ stated in relation to the interpretation of international law that ‘it is an established principle that the right of giving an authoritative interpretation of a legal rule belongs solely to the person or body who has power to modify or suppress it’.⁷⁴ From this point of view, the freedom of State remains the residual rule. Indeterminacy plays into the hand of States.

If States remain silent, they remain free to do what they want.75\nAlternative explanations for interpretative silence do not convince. Disinterest in the topic seems a rather unlikely explanation, given the great relevance of cyber security in contemporary politics. Disagreement among different branches of the government is another possible explanation.76 However, this author is not aware of any such conflicts between different branches of the government within silent States. Coercion of less powerful States to remain silent due to certain power structures and dependencies in international politics (eg of military or economic nature) may also explain their silence. However, the author is not aware of any concrete cases. A final explanation could be that some States have voiced scepticism against the UN GGE. For example, Russia has referred to the UN GGE as ‘a narrow’ and ‘elitist’ expert platform and criticised the report of the UN OEWG for its linkage to the findings of the UN GGE.77 However, this attitude does not explain a general reluctance of States to position themselves outside of the UN GGE context, for example in the more inclusive forum of the UN OEWG.\n## 4. The (legal) consequence of interpretative silence\n## 4.1 States’ interpretation as ‘subsequent practice’\nTo start with the obvious: no State alone can determine the law with a binding effect for itself or for others by positively interpreting it or by not interpreting it. As Weiler and Haltern have argued, ‘autointerpretation, by each state individually, is mostly accepted as a practical inevitability with little, if any, normative value’.78 While States are usually the first and often also the last interpreters of the law (in the absence of delegation of interpretative authority, for example to an international court), it is wrong to claim that ‘each State establishes for itself its legal situation vis-à-vis other States’.79 To state otherwise would go against one of the cornerstones of the international legal order: the equality of States.80 Just as a single State\n75.

These rules also apply to the UN Charter which was concluded before the VCLT entered into force. The formulation of Article 31(3) VCLT indicates that an agreement between all the parties to a treaty is required as it speaks of a ‘subsequent agreement between the parties’ (lit a) or a ‘subsequent practice …which establishes the agreement of the parties’ (lit b). Only an ‘agreement’ constitutes the ‘authentic’ interpretation of the parties to a treaty, which ‘constitutes objective evidence of the understanding of the parties as to the meaning of the treaty’. Subsequent interpretation by one or few parties or conflicting interpretations of different parties do not establish an ‘agreement’. It may only be relevant as ‘supplementary’ means of interpretation even if not all conditions of Article 31(3)(a) or (b) are fulfilled (cf Article 32 VLCT). However, such practice carries considerably less weight. It only serves as a supporting argument for an interpretation that has been reached by other means.\n## 4.2 Silence as acquiescence\nAgainst this background, what is the legal consequence of State’s interpretative silence? Does it matter that some States publish statements on the interpretation of the *jus contra bellum* in cyberspace whereas others refrain from doing so? Does the strategic inactivity leave the law in limbo?\n81. Another option is revocation if the treaty explicitly provides it: see eg Article 50 of the Consolidated Version of the Treaty of the European Union, 26 October 2012, OJ C 326/13 (TEU).

To suggest otherwise would conflict with the established principle of international law (and domestic legal systems): *nemo judex in causa sua* [‘no one should be a judge in their own cause’]. See the PCIJ in *Interpretation of Article 3, Paragraph 2, of the Treaty of Lausanne* (*Frontier between Turkey and Iraq*) (Advisory Opinion)  PCIJ Ser B, no 12, 32 (that ‘no one can be judge in his own suit’ is a ‘well-known rule’ that ‘holds good’).

As a general rule, an ‘agreement’ in the sense of Article 31(3)(a) or (b) must be ‘established’ and therefore it must be positively identifiable.⁹¹ A ‘subsequent agreement’ (lit a) must be clearly manifested (though not necessarily in written form) and *ipso facto* constitutes an ‘authentic interpretation’.⁹² For ‘subsequent practice’ (lit b), it must be shown that the understanding is common to the parties of the treaties by evincing a ‘particular conduct or circumstances’ through which an agreement can be identified indirectly.⁹³ Therefore, ‘a subsequent agreement’ is typically easier to prove than a ‘subsequent practice’.⁹⁴\nA strict threshold of how many States must actively engage in a subsequent practice under lit b is difficult to establish.⁹⁵ As a general rule, the value of the subsequent practice ‘depends on the extent to which it is concordant, common and consistent’.⁹⁶ Here we can draw a parallel to the requirements of customary international law. ‘Subsequent practice’ under Article 31(3)(b) VCLT in essences equals practice under Article 38(1)(b) of the Statute of the International Court of Justice (ICJ Statute)⁹⁷.⁹⁸ The main difference is that, in the context of treaty interpretation, a ‘specific’ practice of the parties to the treaty rather than a ‘general’ practice is required.⁹⁹ The ICJ made clear that the practice of States (accompanied by the required *opinio juris*) needs to be sufficiently general for formation of a rule of customary international law.¹⁰⁰ It must be ‘extensive’,¹⁰¹ ‘sufficiently widespread’¹⁰² and ‘broadly representative’,¹⁰³ in particular by those States whose interests are ‘specially affected’.¹⁰⁴ This means that it is not required to prove a positive practice of all parties at all times.¹⁰⁵ There is no strict standard on the exact number of States’ practices that must be positively proven.¹⁰⁶\n⁹¹.

Other States may have done nothing, but find themselves bound by the emerging rule’.¹⁰⁸\nFrom this follows that relevant silence may be considered a confirmation of the developing interpretative ‘agreement’.¹⁰⁹ Under what circumstance it does so, however, remains a much-contested issue in international legal practice and scholarship.¹¹⁰\nThe first question is: what kind of behaviour qualifies as silence? A clear case of silence is given if a State does not express itself at all in relation to the interpretation of a treaty and any of its provisions. Such behaviour qualifies as a verbal omission and therefore silence.¹¹¹ Generally, statements on the non-application of a treaty or a rule may qualify as relevant ‘subsequent practice’ and do not constitute silence.¹¹² A sufficient detailedness of the interpretative statement is not required. Inconsistent subsequent practice can be precluded from having a normative effect under the principle of estoppel.¹¹³ Hence, claims by some States that Article 51 UN Charter does not apply in cyberspace are devoid of normative effect, if these States have earlier acknowledged that the UN Charter applies in cyberspace.\nThe second question is whether the State’s intention to confirm a certain interpretation through its silence is decisive or whether we should apply objective criteria and rely on the recipient’s perspective.¹¹⁴ In a nutshell, voluntarists argue that States’ silence only has the legal effect that conforms to the will of the silent State.¹¹⁵ For those who support an objective\n107.

Attaching legal effect to States’ silence is a compensation for the ‘soft’ character of this ‘legislative responsibility’.¹²¹ In Starski’s view, such responsibility follows inter alia from a ‘constitutionalist’ reading of international law.¹²² In her view, the ‘eminent’ role of States in the process of law creation and evolution ‘endows states with a specific responsibility towards the effectivity of the international legal system’ which depends on a clarification of the law.¹²³ Only determinacy makes norms operational and allows us to distinguish law from non-law.¹²⁴\nStarski’s argument has merits for several reasons. To start with, the principle of good faith reflected in Article 31(1) VCLT requires States to fulfil their obligation as parties to a treaty, not to impede the effect of the treaty by perpetuating indeterminacy (under certain circumstances, as discussed below).¹²⁵\nWhile a ‘constitutionalist’ reading of international law invoked by Starski comes with challenges,¹²⁶ the ‘legislative responsibility takes account of the shift from a purely State-oriented international legal order of co-existence towards a legal order of cooperation that does not only serve States’ interests but also interests of an alleged ‘international commu\nGeneral Principles and Sources of Law’ (1953) 30 British Year Book of International Law 1, 68; Jacques Bentz, ‘Le silence comme manifestation de volonté en Droit international public’ (1963) 67 Revue Général de Droit International Public 44, 45.\n116.

As the ILC noted, ‘acceptance of a practice by one or more parties by way of silence or inaction is not easily established’.¹²⁹ In order to find a fair balance between the objectification of silence and consensualist concerns, a close scrutiny of the context and setting of the silence is required.¹³⁰ The important qualification is that we can infer consent from silence only – independent of the real intention of the State – if the ‘circumstances were such as called for some reaction’.¹³¹ Only if she must and can speak (*si loqui debuisset ac potuisset*), the neutral maxim that ‘she who keeps silent is held neither to deny nor to accept’ (*qui tacit neque negat, neque utique fatetur*) yields to the maxim that ‘she who keeps silent is held to consent’ (*qui tacit consentire videtur*).¹³²\nThe ILC has pointed to two factors that must be considered to establish whether the circumstances ‘called for some reaction’: ‘the legal situation to which the subsequent practice by the other party relates and the claim thereby expressed’.¹³³ If we break down these two broad criteria into more specific sub-criteria, we can identify nine factors that should be taken into account.¹³⁴\nThe first factor that should be considered is the nature of the State practice itself.¹³⁵ It is relevant whether the interpretative action was a singular event or whether it occurred frequently.¹³⁶ Moreover, it is relevant whether the interpretative action is consistent and whether it has become commonplace.¹³⁷ In this context, the element of time must also be considered: the longer States engage in a certain action, the higher the expectation is that other States react.¹³⁸\n127.

As Starski convincingly argues,\n[t]he very purpose of erga omnes norms would appear to be undermined if the non-protest of bystander states in light of their violation might more easily have a law-altering effect than in the case of ‘ordinary’ rules. ... The erga omnes dimension of norms creates a – rather fictitious – locus standi, but only to the benefit of a norm’s enforceability and not in order to enhance its alterability.¹⁵⁴\nThe eighth factor to be considered is ‘timeliness’.¹⁵⁵ The greater the impact of the proposed interpretation is on interests and rights of a State, the more it is to be expected that it responds in a timely manner.¹⁵⁶\nThe ninth and final factor concerns the nature of the affected rules in question.¹⁵⁷ If the rule in question enjoys a jus cogens or erga omnes status, the threshold for modification is set high. Jus cogens norms require a near-universal State practice and can only be substituted by a norm of the same nature (Article 53 VCLT). As such, silence ‘can only under very limited circumstances issue law formative effects in cases in which peremptory norms are at stake if the very concept of jus cogens is to be kept doctrinally intact’.¹⁵⁸\nIf we apply these standards to the practice of States to the discourse on jus contra bellum in cyberspace, it seems premature to conclude that the silence of States that have not engaged with interpretative proposals made by other States amounts to acquiescence in all contexts.\nTo give one illustrative example: many of those States that have published interpretative statements have endorsed the so-called ‘scale and effects’ test (or a version thereof)¹⁵⁹ that is based on the Nicaragua judgment of the ICJ.¹⁶⁰ Under the ‘scale and effects’ test, a cyber-operation constitutes a ‘use of force’ if its scale and effects are comparable to the scale and effects of a ‘traditional’ use of kinetic force.¹⁶¹\nDoes the silence of some States on whether they agree with this interpretation of the law amount to legally relevant acquiescence? Were the circumstances such that they called for some reaction according to the aforementioned standards?\nSeveral of those standards are met. Mere verbal and written statements may constitute relevant ‘subsequent practice’. Article 31(3)(b) VCLT does not require a physical action as\n(commentaries on Articles 48(1)(a) and 48(1)(b)).

The silent States had the capacity to act and were (or at least ought to be) aware of these interpretative statements (third factor). The statements were made in internationally significant contexts, such as before the UN GGE and UN OEWG, or through official channels, including homepages of ministries of foreign affairs, or other public fora (fourth factor). The jus contra bellum also consists of rules that are by their very nature volatile (fifth factor).\nHowever, if we look at the other relevant factors, it seems doubtful that the circumstances were already such that they called for some reaction. Arguably, the interpretative statements in relation to the ‘scale’ and ‘effect’ test are not sufficiently consistent and widespread (first factor). While there seems to be an agreement on the overall contours of this test and its applicability in cyberspace, there still seems disagreement on its precise scope, for example in relation to the question of whether cyber-operations causing severe non-physical consequences, such as an attack on the nation’s economic system, may also reach the threshold of a use of force. Several States seem to be in favour of this interpretation.¹⁶³ Others, however, seem to be sceptical or leave this question open.¹⁶⁴ It also seems doubtful that a sufficient number of States have publicly subscribed to an application of this test. The subsequent practice must be ‘extensive’¹⁶⁵ and ‘sufficiently widespread’¹⁶⁶ and ‘broadly representative’¹⁶⁷ among States, in particular those whose interests are ‘specially affected’.¹⁶⁸ While the number of States supporting this test is relatively large and seems to be growing, it does not comprise the majority of UN Member States yet. However, it is not unlikely that the relevant threshold will be met in the future, which would increase the expectation of reactions of bystanders.\nMoreover, most States who have begun to position themselves in favour of an application of the ‘scale’ and ‘effect’ in cyberspace test have done so only quite recently (first and eighth factor). The UN OEWG process, in whose context many States have made their statements, has also been only established relatively recently. However, the longer the UN OEWG process is ongoing, the higher the expectation is that other States react to interpretative proposals.\nAs the interpretative proposals relate to the UN Charter and potentially impact rights and interests of all States, one could argue that a reaction can be expected (sixth factor). On the other hand, as has been discussed above, the fact that the UN Charter jus contra bellum rules constitute erga omnes obligations and jus cogens¹⁶⁹ speaks against inferring too easily\n162.

If the rule in question enjoys a *jus cogens* or *erga omnes* status, the threshold for a conclusive interpretation is set very high.\nIn conclusion, good arguments speak in favour of not (yet) qualifying the silence as acquiescence to interpretations that support the ‘scale’ and ‘effect’ test. However, these findings are only a snapshot of the current situation. The more a common position crystallises among a sufficient number of states on the interpretation of the *jus contra bellum* in cyberspace (or specific elements thereof), the more that silent States need to position themselves to avoid their silence being interpreted as acquiescence.\nMoreover, as discussed in the next section, the lack of an interpretative agreement on the ‘scale’ and ‘effect’ test does not necessarily leave the law in limbo as objective interpretative factors must also be considered. International lawyers are justified in making an argument in favour of applying the ‘scale’ and ‘effect’ test to cyberspace on the basis of the wording, objective and purpose of the UN Charter, in light of ICJ jurisprudence (Article 38(1)(d) ICJ Statute).\n## 4.3 The interplay between subjective and objective factors in UN Charter interpretation\nContrary to what the freedom of State paradigm implies, the subjective interpretation of the parties of ‘how’ the UN Charter *jus contra bellum* applies in cyberspace is not the sole factor at play. The subjective interpretation of States is complemented by objective factors, including the ‘ordinary meaning’ of the terms of the treaty (Article 31(1) VCLT), the treaty’s ‘context’ and ‘object and purpose’ (Article 31(1) VCLT), agreements and instruments made with the conclusion of the treaty (Article 31(2) VCLT), and other ‘relevant rules of international law applicable in relations between the parties’ (Article 31(3)(c) VCLT). In treaty interpretation, subjective and objective factors do not stand in a hierarchical relationship with each other; their order merely represents the logical process of interpretation.¹⁷⁰ Subsequent practice is often used in interplay with the other means of interpretation in a ‘single combined operation’.¹⁷¹ At least, this observation holds true with regard to the practice of the ICJ.¹⁷²\nThe complementary interplay of subjective and objective elements in the interpretation of treaties that follows from Article 31 VLCT takes account of the shift from a purely State-oriented international legal order of co-existence towards a legal order of cooperation that has been discussed above.¹⁷³ While the traditional bilateral structure remains the basis to avoid international law sliding into utopianism, treaties have a normative force that is independent from States’ will.¹⁷⁴\n---\n¹⁷⁰.

On community interests, see Simma (n 128) 230.\nJOHANN RUBEN LEISS\nExclusive reliance on the will of States in treaty interpretation would easily lead to gaps in the law if States do not develop a common understanding. In such circumstances, a non-liquet would have to be declared.¹⁷⁵ It would not be possible to determine the meaning of a provision.\nWhile it would go beyond the scope of the present paper to comprehensively discuss the possibility of gaps in the law, a few remarks should suffice. Although we find instances where courts have accepted a non-liquet,¹⁷⁶ judicial practice and scholarship are generally not willing to do so.¹⁷⁷ International rules are per se shrouded by uncertainty and indeterminacy (as any legal rules).¹⁷⁸ Allowing non-liquet would question the very functionality and effectiveness of international law. The judicial function of judges requires that they concretise norms and provide definite answers to legal questions.¹⁷⁹ The plurality of subjective and objective interpretative tools offered by Articles 31–32 VCLT strongly support the view that non-liquet should not be assumed. Important in this context is Article 31(3)(1) VCLT, which provides a pathway of general principles of international law into every interpretative exercise. General principles’ main function is filling gaps in the law, that is, to avoid lacunae left by the (application of the) other sources of international law.¹⁸⁰\nWhile the strategic inactivity of many States to publish their practice undoubtedly has negative consequences for the clarification of the jus contra bellum, it does not leave the law in limbo. The law stands despite the relative lack of States’ contribution to its clarification. Even if States establish a subsequent interpretative agreement in the sense of Article 31(1)(a) or (b) VCLT, such an agreement is only one factor among others that must be considered.\n## 4.5 The role of courts, organs of international organisations and the ILC and the lack of centralised interpretative authority\nAgainst this background, legal ambiguity in the present context is not the consequence of a gap in the law that follows from the interpretative silence of states; rather, it is a misnomer for the lack of centralised interpretative authority in international law. States are not the only relevant actors in the interpretation of international law. A number of institutional actors could potentially play an important role in the normative discourse on ‘how’ jus contra bellum applies in cyberspace, such as international courts and tribunals, organs of international organisations (most importantly UN organs), and the International Law Commission (ILC). However, none of these institutional actors has been equipped with the centralised authority to decide what the correct interpretation of the law is. As such, the clarification of the law is left to an open-ended discursive process.\n---\n¹⁷⁵. *Non liquet* transl. ‘it is not clear’.\n¹⁷⁶.

Even though the ICJ had for a while a considerable number of cases (directly or indirectly) concerning the use of force before it,¹⁸² this trend has not continued, and most of the cases did not make it to the merits.¹⁸³ Importantly for us, the Court has not dealt with questions concerning *jus contra bellum* in cyberspace and it is not likely that it will do so in the near future; other courts or tribunals that may take up the issues are also not in sight.\nWhile the UN GGE played a significant role as a facilitator of normative discourse, it has never been a platform that could have authoritatively determined the correct interpretation of the *jus contra bellum*. The UN GGE was not invested with the power to create new international law.¹⁸⁴ The reports of the UN GGE do not set legal norms themselves. Even if one supports the view that the practice of organs or sub-organs of international organisations may be directly relevant under Article 31–32 VCLT,¹⁸⁵ for example as relevant ‘subsequent practice’, good arguments speak against attaching significant weight to the practice of the UN GGE. The reports only represent the views of experts of a limited number of States (initially 15, now 25). What matters is the reception by all parties to the UN Charter and other international organs of the UN, such as the UN GA.\nThe UN GA may take up issues on *jus contra bellum* in cyberspace and has done so, for example by ‘taking note’ of the assessments and recommendations of the two first UN GGE reports (2010 and 2013) and by ‘welcoming’ the ‘conclusions’ of the third UN GGE report (2015, without a vote, meaning by consensus).¹⁸⁶ However, rather than constituting a centralised form of interpretation, the UN GA practice reflects the cumulative practice of individual States.¹⁸⁷\n---\n¹⁸¹ On the role of ‘judicial decisions’ as ‘subsidiary means, see Mads Andenas and Johann R Leiss, ‘The Systemic Relevance of “Judicial Decisions” in International Law’ (2017) 77 Zeitschrift für ausländisches öffentliches Recht und Völkerrecht 907, 934–935.\n¹⁸² Cf Christine Gray, ‘The Use and Abuse of the International Court of Justice: Cases concerning the Use of Force after Nicaragua’ (2003) 14 European Journal of International Law 867.

They consider it premature to involve the ILC at this stage, since the practice of States is as yet too scarce for the ILC to carry out a meaningful analysis.¹⁹³\nFor the future, however, it cannot be excluded that these actors will contribute to crystallisation of the ‘correct’ interpretation of the law. While their interpretation must (also) be grounded in the will of States, they will mainly process positive manifestations of those States that have actively made their position clear or, in the absence of a clearly identifiable common and consistent practice, have recourse to the objective means of interpretation.\n# 5. Conclusion\nThis article has discussed the politics and legal rationale behind the reluctance of some States to help clarify ‘how’ jus contra bellum applies in cyberspace. It has shown that interpretative silence may backfire in the long run. States’ silence may be interpreted – though only under strict conditions – as acquiescence to an emerging, widely accepted interpretation of the law. Moreover, objective factors beyond the subjective interpretation of States may come to the fore if too many States remain silent and thereby prevent the crystallisation of a sufficiently widely accepted interpretation of the law.\nIn light of these findings, initiatives that encourage States to make their positions publicly available are to be welcomed from a rule of law perspective.¹⁹⁴ They are also in States’ own interests. The vital role of the jus contra bellum rules for the maintenance of peace and security requires interpretative clarity to ensure their efficiency and transparency.

Moreover, interpretation and development of the law would be left to military considerations that all too easily exclude other concerns.\nWhether these calls for more interpretative activity will make the UN OEWG process more successful than the UN GGE remains to be seen. It is more inclusive than the UN GGE and allows more States to be heard. However, the first impression does not seem very promising. The UN OEWG’s initial pre-draft and final report have not added anything substantive to the work of the UN GGE in matters of jus contra bellum in cyberspace.196\nIf the global dialogue on jus contra bellum in cyberspace remains unsuccessful, it seems likely that the path will steer away from global initiatives towards regional processes among like-minded states or even bilateral agreements.197 The US has already indicated that they would consider focusing on ‘likeminded partners’ to tackle cybersecurity issues.198 Likewise, Russia increasingly turns towards the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO).199 Other regional platforms are also becoming involved in cybersecurity issues, such as the Organization of American States, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Regional Forum, the Economic Community of West African States, the African Union, the European Union,200 the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe,201 and the Council of Europe.\nWhile the greater involvement of regional processes in the normative discourse is not a bad thing per se, the universal character of the UN Charter requires universal solutions to avoid ‘fragmentation of the international norms discourse’.202\n## Acknowledgment\nWork on this paper has been conducted under the aegis of the project ‘Security in Internet Governance and Networks: Analysing the Law’ (SIGNAL), funded by the Norwegian Research Council and UNINETT Norid AS.

The report reaffirmed that international law, in particular the UN Charter ‘in its entirety’, applies in cyberspace (explicitly including the prohibition on the use of force) and noted again ‘the inherent right of States to take measures consistent with international law and as recognized in the Charter’.⁶² Whether the UN OEWG, as a more inclusive platform, will be more successful in clarifying the law remains to be seen. So far, the outcomes of the UN OEWG process have been rather limited. They do not go beyond the findings of the UN GGE.⁶³ In its initial pre-draft from April 2020⁶⁴ and in its final substantive report from 10 March 2021,⁶⁵ the UN OEWG noted that States reaffirmed the application of international law, and in particular UN Charter law, to cyberspace. It would go too far to claim that the unwillingness of some States to publish their interpretations and to stay silent is the only reason for the failure of the UN GGE and the UN OEWG to provide more interpretative clarity. Interpretative activity may also lead to disagreement. However, interpretative engagement could have at least paved the way for finding common ground. This is also supported by the recommendations of the UN OEWG pre-draft and final reports, which emphasise the need for further information on the views and practice of States in relation to ‘how’ international law applies in cyberspace.⁶⁶ # 3. The (legal) politics of silence How can we explain the reluctance of States to refrain from submitting their legal positions on the interpretation of the jus contra bellum in cyberspace and the preference of some to foster new law-making instead of clarifying existing law? As States rarely explain the reasons for their silence, we can only speculate on their motives. A convincing explanation is that their choice for inactivity is driven by a preference for legal ambiguity, which finds its legal rationale in the traditional ‘freedom of State’ paradigm. The discussion on the regulation of cyberwarfare is not only about the correct interpretation of the law but it ‘is as much about strategy, politics and ideological differences’.⁶⁷ The interpretative approaches chosen by States often reflect their broader strategical interests, which coincide with their economic, military and technical capacities.⁶⁸ Historically this has always been the case; the new reality of cyberwarfare has not changed this. How States interpret jus contra bellum in cyberspace is not independent of their respective ICT strengths and ⁶⁰. A/RES/73/266 (2019). ⁶¹. A/76/135 (2021). ⁶². ibid [69] and [71(d)]. ⁶³.

One possible explanation is that States wait for further technical developments before they formulate their own interpretative approaches. The speed and unpredictability of the development of new digital technologies create enormous strategic uncertainties.⁷¹ While economical resources and technical capacities are also of great importance in the context of cyberwarfare, the open structure of cyberspace seems to have re-shuffled many of the old certainties. Small States with a limited budget and little conventional military power can conduct military measures which have a large-scale effect in almost every corner of the world. Despite their strong conventional military powers, traditional strong military and economic powers feel increasingly vulnerable due to their strong digital connectedness. Against the background of these strategic uncertainties, it seems to be – at least at first glance – a rational choice for States to aim at paralysing legal clarification and perpetuating legal uncertainty, as they cannot sufficiently predict the long-term consequences of their own legal interpretation.⁷² From a legal-theoretical perspective, this choice of strategic ambiguity can only be explained by the traditional so-called ‘freedom of State’ paradigm. This state-oriented and subjective perspective paradigm considers the freedom and the will of States paramount. It found its most famous manifestation in the Lotus dictum of the Permanent Court of International Justice in 1927. The court held that international law governs relations between independent States. The rules of law binding upon States therefore emanate from their own free will as expressed in conventions or by usage generally accepted as expressing principles of law and established in order to regulate the relations between these co-existing independent communities or with a view to the achievement of common aims. Restrictions on the independence of States cannot therefore presumed.⁷³ From this perspective, States are only bound by the extent to which they have consented to the rule of international law. Not only the formation of rules, but also their interpretation, follows this paradigm. In an earlier judgment, the PCIJ stated in relation to the interpretation of international law that ‘it is an established principle that the right of giving an authoritative interpretation of a legal rule belongs solely to the person or body who has power to modify or suppress it’.⁷⁴ From this point of view, the freedom of State remains the residual rule. Indeterminacy plays into the hand of States.

If States remain silent, they remain free to do what they want.75 Alternative explanations for interpretative silence do not convince. Disinterest in the topic seems a rather unlikely explanation, given the great relevance of cyber security in contemporary politics. Disagreement among different branches of the government is another possible explanation.76 However, this author is not aware of any such conflicts between different branches of the government within silent States. Coercion of less powerful States to remain silent due to certain power structures and dependencies in international politics (eg of military or economic nature) may also explain their silence. However, the author is not aware of any concrete cases. A final explanation could be that some States have voiced scepticism against the UN GGE. For example, Russia has referred to the UN GGE as ‘a narrow’ and ‘elitist’ expert platform and criticised the report of the UN OEWG for its linkage to the findings of the UN GGE.77 However, this attitude does not explain a general reluctance of States to position themselves outside of the UN GGE context, for example in the more inclusive forum of the UN OEWG. ## 4. The (legal) consequence of interpretative silence ## 4.1 States’ interpretation as ‘subsequent practice’ To start with the obvious: no State alone can determine the law with a binding effect for itself or for others by positively interpreting it or by not interpreting it. As Weiler and Haltern have argued, ‘autointerpretation, by each state individually, is mostly accepted as a practical inevitability with little, if any, normative value’.78 While States are usually the first and often also the last interpreters of the law (in the absence of delegation of interpretative authority, for example to an international court), it is wrong to claim that ‘each State establishes for itself its legal situation vis-à-vis other States’.79 To state otherwise would go against one of the cornerstones of the international legal order: the equality of States.80 Just as a single State"

This article argues that it is only by actively contributing to the clarification of the law that States ensure their voice is heard and avoid the risk that their silence is interpreted as acquiescence. Moreover, contrary to what the freedom of State paradigm implies, the subjective interpretation of the parties is not the only 'game in town'. If no interpretative agreement of States crystallises, the interpretation of jus contra bellum is determined by objective factors. The article concludes by arguing that from a rule of law perspective, States should be encouraged to express their views on 'how' jus contra bellum applies in cyberspace to ensure the efficiency and transparency of these rules, which constitute part of the backbone of a peaceful co-existence and cooperation between states.\n## Keywords jus contra bellum, cyberwarfare, treaty interpretation, acquiescence, UN GGE, UN OEWG ## 1. Introduction Among the great challenges to international law posed by the digitisation of our modern world is the fact that modern warfare has expanded into cyberspace.¹ As with any technical developments in human history, warfare has taken up new digital technologies.² Modern armies have the capability to cause death and destruction via cyberspace. At the same time, societies have become increasingly vulnerable.³ Much critical infrastructure is digitalised, Copyright © 2024 Author(s).

These rules apply to cyberspace.¹¹ This is confirmed by numerous statements of States and by the outputs of the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing responsible State behaviour in cyberspace in the context of international security (‘UN GGE’)¹² and the United Nations Open-Ended Working Group on Developments in the Field of ICTs in the Context of International Security (‘UN OEWG’).¹³ The 2013 consensus report of the third UN GGE noted in general terms that international law and, in particular, the UN Charter applies in cyberspace.¹⁴ The following 2015 and 2021 reports of the fourth and sixth UN GGEs made clear that the UN Charter ‘applies in its entirety’.¹⁵ However, there is still much uncertainty on exactly ‘how’ these rules apply.¹⁶ To give just JOHANN RUBEN LEISS a few instructive and much discussed examples: What kind of ICT-related activities constitute a ‘threat’ or ‘use of force’ (Article 2(4) UN Charter)? What kind of activities constitute an ‘armed attack’ and might give a State cause to invoke its inherent right to self-defence (Article 51 UN Charter)?¹⁷ Where along the spectrum of permissible to impermissible conduct do various types of cyber-attacks lie? How is mere cyber-criminality to be distinguished from warfare? Should we apply the so-called ‘scale and effects’ test according to which a cyberoperation constitutes a ‘use of force’ if its scale and effects are comparable to the scale and effects of a ‘traditional’ use of kinetic force? How can we attribute use of force in cyberspace?¹⁸ More generally, how do we apply rules that are based on the existence of geographical borders, over which States exercise sovereignty, to cyberspace, in which such borders are far from distinct?¹⁹ Considering these open questions, it is all the more remarkable that many States shy away from actively contributing to the interpretative clarification of the law. They do not publish interpretative statements and do not make their practice of cyberwarfare public.\nPart 2 discusses the (in)activity of States to contribute to the interpretative clarification of ‘how’ jus contra bellum applies in cyberspace and discusses its negative repercussions for the work of the UN GGE and UN OEWG. Part 3 discusses possible explanations for the (legal) politics behind this interpretative silence. It argues that silence can be explained by a strategy of legal ambiguity, which finds its legal rationale in the traditional ‘freedom of State’ paradigm. The aim of this strategy is to keep the jus contra bellum in limbo and open scope for manoeuvre to cope with new technical developments and remaining strategic uncertainties in cyberwarfare.\nPart 4 discusses the (legal) consequences of interpretative silence and challenges its underlying rationale. The argument is that under the discursive framework provided by Articles 31–33 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (‘VCLT’)²⁰, the interpretation – or non-interpretation – of the parties to a treaty remains a central factor to be taken into account. However, it is only by actively contributing to the clarification of the law that States ensure their voice is heard and avoid the risk that their silence is interpreted as acquiescence. Moreover, contrary to what the freedom of State paradigm implies, the subjective interpretation of the parties is not the only ‘game in town’. Articles 31–32 VCLT and other factors complement the subjective dimension of interpretation with an objective one. The less the ‘authentic’ interpretation of the parties leads to interpretative clarification, the more the other modes of interpretation come to the fore. As such, legal ambiguity is a misnomer for the lack of centralised interpretative authority in international law.

Interpretative silence and jus contra bellum in cyberspace ### 2.1 Jus contra bellum in cyberspace – a question of UN Charter interpretation The present article presumes that questions concerning the application of *jus contra bellum* to cyberspace are first and foremost a matter of UN Charter interpretation. In the author’s view, the UN Charter-based *jus contra bellum* norms and their customary corollaries have merged into a single norm,²¹ even though the customary manifestation is based in a different source, and insofar remains conceptually independent from its treaty corollary.²² Article 103 UN Charter, which attaches supremacy to UN Charter law over other international law, also applies to customary international law.²³ As such, customary derogation from the UN Charter based *jus contra bellum* is excluded.\nUnder what conditions an interpretation of UN Charter law amounts to a modification of the rules in question must not be conclusively discussed here. While further development of the Charter by consensual re-interpretation and customary application is possible,²⁴ for the present purpose it is sufficient to keep in mind that it is not easily to be presumed that States want to circumvent the strict requirements for Charter amendments (Articles 108 and 109 UN Charter).²⁵ There are, however, notable examples of informal UN Charter modification.²⁶ ### 2.2 Widespread interpretative silence Considering the overall picture, we see that many States remain reluctant to clearly position themselves and contribute to a clarification of ‘how’ *jus contra bellum* applies in cyberspace.²⁷ An increasing number of States have published ‘cyber security strategies’,²⁸ and a growing number of States have also begun to publish statements on international law in cyberspace.²⁹ --- JOHANN RUBEN LEISS However, only a relatively small number of States has provided (relatively) detailed interpretations – within or outside the UN GGE and UN OEWG context – of ‘how’ jus contra bellum applies in cyberspace. The scope and detailedness of their interpretative statements vary widely.³⁰ Most States confirm an application of the prohibition of the use of Speech on Estonia's position by President Kersti Kaljulaid in Tallinn from 29 May 2019 <www.president.ee official-duties=\"\"en=\"\"index.html=\"\"of=\"\"speech=\"\"speeches=\"\"15241-president-of-the-republic-at-the-opening-of-cycon-2019=\"\"> ('Estonia's position 2019');

The second group of experts (again 15 members)⁴¹ eventually managed to reach an agreement on a short 2010 consensus report.⁴² However, this report only contained a few rudimentary findings and recommendations. It acknowledged the problem of attribution of cyberoperations and risk of potential threats, the ‘absence of a common understanding regarding acceptable State behaviour’, and more generally, the ‘lack of shared understanding regarding international norms pertaining to State use of ICTs’.⁴³ Furthermore, it noted that ‘[e]xisting agreements include norms relevant to the use of ICTs by States’, that ‘additional norms could be developed over time’, and that the dialogue should continue.⁴⁴ In 2011, a third group of experts (again 15 members) was set up.⁴⁵ This time the mandate of the group specifically asked not only for a discussion of ‘international concepts aimed at OSLO LAW REVIEW | VOLUME 9 | No.1-2022 33 strengthening the security of global information and telecommunications systems’ but also of ‘norms, rules or principles of responsible behaviour of States’.⁴⁶ The third group submitted in 2013 a consensus report reemphasising the findings of the previous report.⁴⁷ Importantly, the report noted for the first time explicitly that international law and in particular the UN Charter apply in cyberspace.⁴⁸ In December 2013, a fourth group of governmental experts was established, with their number increased to 20 members.⁴⁹ The mandate of the fourth group included now specifically the question of ‘how’ international law applies in cyberspace.⁵⁰ In 2015, the fourth group elaborated on some of the findings of the two previous UN GGE reports in a new consensus report.⁵¹ The group went further than the previous report by not only affirming in general terms that the UN Charter applies, but by explicitly noting that it ‘applies in its entirety’ and that States have an ‘inherent right …to take measures consistent with international law and as recognized in the Charter’.⁵² Moreover, it included explicit references to ‘the principles of humanity, necessity, proportionality and distinction’ and the obligation on States not to ‘use proxies to commit internationally wrongful acts using ICTs’ and to ‘ensure that their territory is not used by non-State actors to commit such acts’.⁵³ Again, however, the report did not go into further detail and noted that there was a ‘need for further study on this matter’.⁵⁴ In addition, the report included ‘recommendations for consideration by States for voluntary, non-binding norms, rules or principles of responsible behaviour of States aimed at promoting an open, secure, stable, accessible and peaceful ICT environment’.⁵⁵ Many of these non-binding norms simply resemble what is already codified in international law as binding norms. As such, the report did not add much to the clarification of ‘how’ jus contra bellum applies in cyberspace.⁵⁶ In 2015, a fifth group of experts was established, again with an increased number of members (now 25).⁵⁷ This time, however, the discussions proved even more difficult than in the previous rounds. In June 2017, the experts failed to agree on a draft for a consensus report.⁵⁸ As previously mentioned, one explanation is that Cuba, China and Russia opposed the inclusion of references to the application of the right to self-defence (and the general international law principles of countermeasures and international humanitarian law).⁵⁹ JOHANN RUBEN LEISS In 2019, the sixth group (again 25 members) was established to continue the work of its predecessors.⁶⁰ The group delivered a report in 2021 and thus broke through the stalemate of the previous round.⁶¹ However, it did not add much in terms of substance to the clarification of the law. The report reaffirmed that international law, in particular the UN Charter ‘in its entirety’, applies in cyberspace (explicitly including the prohibition on the use of force) and noted again ‘the inherent right of States to take measures consistent with international law and as recognized in the Charter’.⁶² Whether the UN OEWG, as a more inclusive platform, will be more successful in clarifying the law remains to be seen. So far, the outcomes of the UN OEWG process have been rather limited. They do not go beyond the findings of the UN GGE.⁶³ In its initial pre-draft from April 2020⁶⁴ and in its final substantive report from 10 March 2021,⁶⁵ the UN OEWG noted that States reaffirmed the application of international law, and in particular UN Charter law, to cyberspace.\nIt would go too far to claim that the unwillingness of some States to publish their interpretations and to stay silent is the only reason for the failure of the UN GGE and the UN OEWG to provide more interpretative clarity. Interpretative activity may also lead to disagreement. However, interpretative engagement could have at least paved the way for finding common ground. This is also supported by the recommendations of the UN OEWG pre-draft and final reports, which emphasise the need for further information on the views and practice of States in relation to ‘how’ international law applies in cyberspace.⁶⁶ # 3. The (legal) politics of silence How can we explain the reluctance of States to refrain from submitting their legal positions on the interpretation of the jus contra bellum in cyberspace and the preference of some to foster new law-making instead of clarifying existing law? As States rarely explain the reasons for their silence, we can only speculate on their motives. A convincing explanation is that their choice for inactivity is driven by a preference for legal ambiguity, which finds its legal rationale in the traditional ‘freedom of State’ paradigm.\nThe discussion on the regulation of cyberwarfare is not only about the correct interpretation of the law but it ‘is as much about strategy, politics and ideological differences’.⁶⁷ The interpretative approaches chosen by States often reflect their broader strategical interests, which coincide with their economic, military and technical capacities.⁶⁸ Historically this has always been the case; the new reality of cyberwarfare has not changed this. How States interpret jus contra bellum in cyberspace is not independent of their respective ICT strengths and ⁶⁰. A/RES/73/266 (2019).\n⁶¹. A/76/135 (2021).\n⁶². ibid [69] and [71(d)].\n⁶³.

One possible explanation is that States wait for further technical developments before they formulate their own interpretative approaches. The speed and unpredictability of the development of new digital technologies create enormous strategic uncertainties.⁷¹ While economical resources and technical capacities are also of great importance in the context of cyberwarfare, the open structure of cyberspace seems to have re-shuffled many of the old certainties. Small States with a limited budget and little conventional military power can conduct military measures which have a large-scale effect in almost every corner of the world. Despite their strong conventional military powers, traditional strong military and economic powers feel increasingly vulnerable due to their strong digital connectedness. Against the background of these strategic uncertainties, it seems to be – at least at first glance – a rational choice for States to aim at paralysing legal clarification and perpetuating legal uncertainty, as they cannot sufficiently predict the long-term consequences of their own legal interpretation.⁷² From a legal-theoretical perspective, this choice of strategic ambiguity can only be explained by the traditional so-called ‘freedom of State’ paradigm. This state-oriented and subjective perspective paradigm considers the freedom and the will of States paramount. It found its most famous manifestation in the Lotus dictum of the Permanent Court of International Justice in 1927. The court held that international law governs relations between independent States. The rules of law binding upon States therefore emanate from their own free will as expressed in conventions or by usage generally accepted as expressing principles of law and established in order to regulate the relations between these co-existing independent communities or with a view to the achievement of common aims. Restrictions on the independence of States cannot therefore presumed.⁷³ From this perspective, States are only bound by the extent to which they have consented to the rule of international law. Not only the formation of rules, but also their interpretation, follows this paradigm. In an earlier judgment, the PCIJ stated in relation to the interpretation of international law that ‘it is an established principle that the right of giving an authoritative interpretation of a legal rule belongs solely to the person or body who has power to modify or suppress it’.⁷⁴ From this point of view, the freedom of State remains the residual rule.

If States remain silent, they remain free to do what they want.75 Alternative explanations for interpretative silence do not convince. Disinterest in the topic seems a rather unlikely explanation, given the great relevance of cyber security in contemporary politics. Disagreement among different branches of the government is another possible explanation.76 However, this author is not aware of any such conflicts between different branches of the government within silent States. Coercion of less powerful States to remain silent due to certain power structures and dependencies in international politics (eg of military or economic nature) may also explain their silence. However, the author is not aware of any concrete cases. A final explanation could be that some States have voiced scepticism against the UN GGE. For example, Russia has referred to the UN GGE as ‘a narrow’ and ‘elitist’ expert platform and criticised the report of the UN OEWG for its linkage to the findings of the UN GGE.77 However, this attitude does not explain a general reluctance of States to position themselves outside of the UN GGE context, for example in the more inclusive forum of the UN OEWG.\n## 4. The (legal) consequence of interpretative silence ## 4.1 States’ interpretation as ‘subsequent practice’ To start with the obvious: no State alone can determine the law with a binding effect for itself or for others by positively interpreting it or by not interpreting it. As Weiler and Haltern have argued, ‘autointerpretation, by each state individually, is mostly accepted as a practical inevitability with little, if any, normative value’.78 While States are usually the first and often also the last interpreters of the law (in the absence of delegation of interpretative authority, for example to an international court), it is wrong to claim that ‘each State establishes for itself its legal situation vis-à-vis other States’.79 To state otherwise would go against one of the cornerstones of the international legal order: the equality of States.80 Just as a single State OSLO LAW REVIEW | VOLUME 9 | No.1-2022 37 may not create law by itself – with the exception of unilateral declarations – and may not unilaterally release itself from treaty obligations outside the narrow conditions circumscribed in Articles 46–53 VCLT (invalidation, termination, or suspension),[81] it may not interpret the law with binding force either.[82] This is confirmed by Articles 31–32 VCLT (and their customary equivalents).[83] These rules also apply to the UN Charter which was concluded before the VCLT entered into force.[84] The formulation of Article 31(3) VCLT indicates that an agreement between all the parties to a treaty is required as it speaks of a ‘subsequent agreement between the parties’ (lit a) or a ‘subsequent practice …which establishes the agreement of the parties’ (lit b).[85] Only an ‘agreement’ constitutes the ‘authentic’ interpretation of the parties to a treaty, which ‘constitutes objective evidence of the understanding of the parties as to the meaning of the treaty’.[86] Subsequent interpretation by one or few parties or conflicting interpretations of different parties do not establish an ‘agreement’.[87] It may only be relevant as ‘supplementary’ means of interpretation even if not all conditions of Article 31(3)(a) or (b) are fulfilled (cf Article 32 VLCT).[88] However, such practice carries considerably less weight.[89] It only serves as a supporting argument for an interpretation that has been reached by other means.[90] ## 4.2 Silence as acquiescence Against this background, what is the legal consequence of State’s interpretative silence? Does it matter that some States publish statements on the interpretation of the *jus contra bellum* in cyberspace whereas others refrain from doing so? Does the strategic inactivity leave the law in limbo?\n\nJOHANN RUBEN LEISS Absence of interpretation of some States does not necessarily stall the establishment of the authentic interpretation of the treaty provision in question. As a general rule, an ‘agreement’ in the sense of Article 31(3)(a) or (b) must be ‘established’ and therefore it must be positively identifiable.⁹¹ A ‘subsequent agreement’ (lit a) must be clearly manifested (though not necessarily in written form) and *ipso facto* constitutes an ‘authentic interpretation’.⁹² For ‘subsequent practice’ (lit b), it must be shown that the understanding is common to the parties of the treaties by evincing a ‘particular conduct or circumstances’ through which an agreement can be identified indirectly.⁹³ Therefore, ‘a subsequent agreement’ is typically easier to prove than a ‘subsequent practice’.⁹⁴ A strict threshold of how many States must actively engage in a subsequent practice under lit b is difficult to establish.⁹⁵ As a general rule, the value of the subsequent practice ‘depends on the extent to which it is concordant, common and consistent’.⁹⁶ Here we can draw a parallel to the requirements of customary international law. ‘Subsequent practice’ under Article 31(3)(b) VCLT in essences equals practice under Article 38(1)(b) of the Statute of the International Court of Justice (ICJ Statute)⁹⁷.⁹⁸ The main difference is that, in the context of treaty interpretation, a ‘specific’ practice of the parties to the treaty rather than a ‘general’ practice is required.⁹⁹ The ICJ made clear that the practice of States (accompanied by the required *opinio juris*) needs to be sufficiently general for formation of a rule of customary international law.¹⁰⁰ It must be ‘extensive’,¹⁰¹ ‘sufficiently widespread’¹⁰² and ‘broadly representative’,¹⁰³ in particular by those States whose interests are ‘specially affected’.¹⁰⁴ This means that it is not required to prove a positive practice of all parties at all times.¹⁰⁵ There is no strict standard on the exact number of States’ practices that must be positively proven.¹⁰⁶ ⁹¹.

Other States may have done nothing, but find themselves bound by the emerging rule’.¹⁰⁸ From this follows that relevant silence may be considered a confirmation of the developing interpretative ‘agreement’.¹⁰⁹ Under what circumstance it does so, however, remains a much-contested issue in international legal practice and scholarship.¹¹⁰ The first question is: what kind of behaviour qualifies as silence? A clear case of silence is given if a State does not express itself at all in relation to the interpretation of a treaty and any of its provisions. Such behaviour qualifies as a verbal omission and therefore silence.¹¹¹ Generally, statements on the non-application of a treaty or a rule may qualify as relevant ‘subsequent practice’ and do not constitute silence.¹¹² A sufficient detailedness of the interpretative statement is not required. Inconsistent subsequent practice can be precluded from having a normative effect under the principle of estoppel.¹¹³ Hence, claims by some States that Article 51 UN Charter does not apply in cyberspace are devoid of normative effect, if these States have earlier acknowledged that the UN Charter applies in cyberspace.\nThe second question is whether the State’s intention to confirm a certain interpretation through its silence is decisive or whether we should apply objective criteria and rely on the recipient’s perspective.¹¹⁴ In a nutshell, voluntarists argue that States’ silence only has the legal effect that conforms to the will of the silent State.¹¹⁵ For those who support an objective JOHANN RUBEN LEISS approach,¹¹⁶ silence is first and foremost a fact and the legal effect follows from ‘legitimate expectations of other actors’ which can be inferred from the context.¹¹⁷ For example, Starski argues that ‘silence will never reveal the true beliefs of an actor: “belief” will necessarily be constructed merely from the contextual setting’.¹¹⁸ In addition, she suggests that international law imposes on States a ‘legislative responsibility’ to engage in active interpretation if the circumstances have called for some reaction to ensure international law’s effectivity and legal certainty.¹¹⁹ This ‘legislative responsibility’ is only a soft obligation (in German ‘Obliegenheit’, which can be translated into ‘incumbency’)¹²⁰ that is not enforceable and sanctionable. Attaching legal effect to States’ silence is a compensation for the ‘soft’ character of this ‘legislative responsibility’.¹²¹ In Starski’s view, such responsibility follows inter alia from a ‘constitutionalist’ reading of international law.¹²² In her view, the ‘eminent’ role of States in the process of law creation and evolution ‘endows states with a specific responsibility towards the effectivity of the international legal system’ which depends on a clarification of the law.¹²³ Only determinacy makes norms operational and allows us to distinguish law from non-law.¹²⁴ Starski’s argument has merits for several reasons. To start with, the principle of good faith reflected in Article 31(1) VCLT requires States to fulfil their obligation as parties to a treaty, not to impede the effect of the treaty by perpetuating indeterminacy (under certain circumstances, as discussed below).¹²⁵ While a ‘constitutionalist’ reading of international law invoked by Starski comes with challenges,¹²⁶ the ‘legislative responsibility takes account of the shift from a purely State-oriented international legal order of co-existence towards a legal order of cooperation that does not only serve States’ interests but also interests of an alleged ‘international commu General Principles and Sources of Law’ (1953) 30 British Year Book of International Law 1, 68; Jacques Bentz, ‘Le silence comme manifestation de volonté en Droit international public’ (1963) 67 Revue Général de Droit International Public 44, 45.\n\nOSLO LAW REVIEW | VOLUME 9 | No.1-2022 This is not, however, to suggest that acquiescence is always presumed if States remain silent. As the ILC noted, ‘acceptance of a practice by one or more parties by way of silence or inaction is not easily established’.¹²⁹ In order to find a fair balance between the objectification of silence and consensualist concerns, a close scrutiny of the context and setting of the silence is required.¹³⁰ The important qualification is that we can infer consent from silence only – independent of the real intention of the State – if the ‘circumstances were such as called for some reaction’.¹³¹ Only if she must and can speak (*si loqui debuisset ac potuisset*), the neutral maxim that ‘she who keeps silent is held neither to deny nor to accept’ (*qui tacit neque negat, neque utique fatetur*) yields to the maxim that ‘she who keeps silent is held to consent’ (*qui tacit consentire videtur*).¹³² The ILC has pointed to two factors that must be considered to establish whether the circumstances ‘called for some reaction’: ‘the legal situation to which the subsequent practice by the other party relates and the claim thereby expressed’.¹³³ If we break down these two broad criteria into more specific sub-criteria, we can identify nine factors that should be taken into account.¹³⁴ The first factor that should be considered is the nature of the State practice itself.¹³⁵ It is relevant whether the interpretative action was a singular event or whether it occurred frequently.¹³⁶ Moreover, it is relevant whether the interpretative action is consistent and whether it has become commonplace.¹³⁷ In this context, the element of time must also be considered: the longer States engage in a certain action, the higher the expectation is that other States react.¹³⁸ JOHANN RUBEN LEISS The second factor concerns the claim made by the acting State.¹³⁹ Only if the State claims that its conduct is in conformity with the law can a reaction by other States be legitimately expected.¹⁴⁰ However, this is often difficult to establish in practice.¹⁴¹ The third factor is whether the silent State was aware (which would be difficult to prove) or 'ought to have been aware' of the conduct of the other State.¹⁴² Moreover, the State must have had the capacity to act.¹⁴³ The fourth factor that needs to be included in the assessment is the context in which the relevant claim was made.¹⁴⁴ The more internationally significant a context is, the more it can be expected that States react to claims made in this context.¹⁴⁵ For example, UN organs constitute a highly significant context for claims made in relation to the interpretation of the UN Charter.¹⁴⁶ The more volatile a rule is (either due to ongoing discourses over its meaning, or due to its generally vague character), the more it is expected that States react to claims made by other States.¹⁴⁷ Power relations between States (eg of military or economic nature) must only be considered under certain exceptional circumstances (such as fraud, corruption or threat or coercion by the threat or use of force).¹⁴⁸ The fifth factor concerns the reactions of other actors.¹⁴⁹ If we find ourselves in a situation of accelerating interpretative discourse (indicating increased normative volatility), there can be a higher expectation that 'bystanders' react.¹⁵⁰ The sixth factor to be considered is the impact of the proposed interpretation on rights and interests of States.¹⁵¹ The more the rights and interests of the State are affected, the more a reaction can be expected.¹⁵² Good arguments, however, speak in favour of not automatically inferring acquiescence in relation to the interpretation of *jus contra bellum*, even though as *erga omnes* obligations the *jus contra bellum* rules embody the interests of the whole international community, which includes every State.¹⁵³ It would be problematic if OSLO LAW REVIEW | VOLUME 9 | No.1-2022 43 the qualification of a norm as erga omnes would lead to a higher expectation that States positively react. As Starski convincingly argues, [t]he very purpose of erga omnes norms would appear to be undermined if the non-protest of bystander states in light of their violation might more easily have a law-altering effect than in the case of ‘ordinary’ rules.... The erga omnes dimension of norms creates a – rather fictitious – locus standi, but only to the benefit of a norm’s enforceability and not in order to enhance its alterability.¹⁵⁴ The eighth factor to be considered is ‘timeliness’.¹⁵⁵ The greater the impact of the proposed interpretation is on interests and rights of a State, the more it is to be expected that it responds in a timely manner.¹⁵⁶ The ninth and final factor concerns the nature of the affected rules in question.¹⁵⁷ If the rule in question enjoys a jus cogens or erga omnes status, the threshold for modification is set high. Jus cogens norms require a near-universal State practice and can only be substituted by a norm of the same nature (Article 53 VCLT). As such, silence ‘can only under very limited circumstances issue law formative effects in cases in which peremptory norms are at stake if the very concept of jus cogens is to be kept doctrinally intact’.¹⁵⁸ If we apply these standards to the practice of States to the discourse on jus contra bellum in cyberspace, it seems premature to conclude that the silence of States that have not engaged with interpretative proposals made by other States amounts to acquiescence in all contexts.\nTo give one illustrative example: many of those States that have published interpretative statements have endorsed the so-called ‘scale and effects’ test (or a version thereof)¹⁵⁹ that is based on the Nicaragua judgment of the ICJ.¹⁶⁰ Under the ‘scale and effects’ test, a cyber-operation constitutes a ‘use of force’ if its scale and effects are comparable to the scale and effects of a ‘traditional’ use of kinetic force.¹⁶¹ Does the silence of some States on whether they agree with this interpretation of the law amount to legally relevant acquiescence? Were the circumstances such that they called for some reaction according to the aforementioned standards?\nSeveral of those standards are met. Mere verbal and written statements may constitute relevant ‘subsequent practice’. Article 31(3)(b) VCLT does not require a physical action as (commentaries on Articles 48(1)(a) and 48(1)(b)). On the erga omnes status of the prohibition of the use of force, see Barcelona Traction (n 153) 32 [34]; Kopela (n 114) 107; Danilenko (n 115) 40.\n\nJOHANN RUBEN LEISS ‘subsequent practice’.¹⁶² The claims relating to the ‘scale’ and ‘effect’ are meant to provide an interpretation of the law and not an explanation of unlawful behaviour (second factor). The silent States had the capacity to act and were (or at least ought to be) aware of these interpretative statements (third factor). The statements were made in internationally significant contexts, such as before the UN GGE and UN OEWG, or through official channels, including homepages of ministries of foreign affairs, or other public fora (fourth factor). The jus contra bellum also consists of rules that are by their very nature volatile (fifth factor).\nHowever, if we look at the other relevant factors, it seems doubtful that the circumstances were already such that they called for some reaction. Arguably, the interpretative statements in relation to the ‘scale’ and ‘effect’ test are not sufficiently consistent and widespread (first factor). While there seems to be an agreement on the overall contours of this test and its applicability in cyberspace, there still seems disagreement on its precise scope, for example in relation to the question of whether cyber-operations causing severe non-physical consequences, such as an attack on the nation’s economic system, may also reach the threshold of a use of force. Several States seem to be in favour of this interpretation.¹⁶³ Others, however, seem to be sceptical or leave this question open.¹⁶⁴ It also seems doubtful that a sufficient number of States have publicly subscribed to an application of this test. The subsequent practice must be ‘extensive’¹⁶⁵ and ‘sufficiently widespread’¹⁶⁶ and ‘broadly representative’¹⁶⁷ among States, in particular those whose interests are ‘specially affected’.¹⁶⁸ While the number of States supporting this test is relatively large and seems to be growing, it does not comprise the majority of UN Member States yet. However, it is not unlikely that the relevant threshold will be met in the future, which would increase the expectation of reactions of bystanders.\nMoreover, most States who have begun to position themselves in favour of an application of the ‘scale’ and ‘effect’ in cyberspace test have done so only quite recently (first and eighth factor). The UN OEWG process, in whose context many States have made their statements, has also been only established relatively recently. However, the longer the UN OEWG process is ongoing, the higher the expectation is that other States react to interpretative proposals.\nAs the interpretative proposals relate to the UN Charter and potentially impact rights and interests of all States, one could argue that a reaction can be expected (sixth factor). On the other hand, as has been discussed above, the fact that the UN Charter jus contra bellum rules constitute erga omnes obligations and jus cogens¹⁶⁹ speaks against inferring too easily OSLO LAW REVIEW | VOLUME 9 | No.1-2022 45 acquiescence from silence. If the rule in question enjoys a *jus cogens* or *erga omnes* status, the threshold for a conclusive interpretation is set very high.\nIn conclusion, good arguments speak in favour of not (yet) qualifying the silence as acquiescence to interpretations that support the ‘scale’ and ‘effect’ test. However, these findings are only a snapshot of the current situation. The more a common position crystallises among a sufficient number of states on the interpretation of the *jus contra bellum* in cyberspace (or specific elements thereof), the more that silent States need to position themselves to avoid their silence being interpreted as acquiescence.\nMoreover, as discussed in the next section, the lack of an interpretative agreement on the ‘scale’ and ‘effect’ test does not necessarily leave the law in limbo as objective interpretative factors must also be considered. International lawyers are justified in making an argument in favour of applying the ‘scale’ and ‘effect’ test to cyberspace on the basis of the wording, objective and purpose of the UN Charter, in light of ICJ jurisprudence (Article 38(1)(d) ICJ Statute).\n## 4.3 The interplay between subjective and objective factors in UN Charter interpretation Contrary to what the freedom of State paradigm implies, the subjective interpretation of the parties of ‘how’ the UN Charter *jus contra bellum* applies in cyberspace is not the sole factor at play. The subjective interpretation of States is complemented by objective factors, including the ‘ordinary meaning’ of the terms of the treaty (Article 31(1) VCLT), the treaty’s ‘context’ and ‘object and purpose’ (Article 31(1) VCLT), agreements and instruments made with the conclusion of the treaty (Article 31(2) VCLT), and other ‘relevant rules of international law applicable in relations between the parties’ (Article 31(3)(c) VCLT). In treaty interpretation, subjective and objective factors do not stand in a hierarchical relationship with each other; their order merely represents the logical process of interpretation.¹⁷⁰ Subsequent practice is often used in interplay with the other means of interpretation in a ‘single combined operation’.¹⁷¹ At least, this observation holds true with regard to the practice of the ICJ.¹⁷² The complementary interplay of subjective and objective elements in the interpretation of treaties that follows from Article 31 VLCT takes account of the shift from a purely State-oriented international legal order of co-existence towards a legal order of cooperation that has been discussed above.¹⁷³ While the traditional bilateral structure remains the basis to avoid international law sliding into utopianism, treaties have a normative force that is independent from States’ will.¹⁷⁴ --- ¹⁷⁰.

On community interests, see Simma (n 128) 230.\nJOHANN RUBEN LEISS Exclusive reliance on the will of States in treaty interpretation would easily lead to gaps in the law if States do not develop a common understanding. In such circumstances, a non-liquet would have to be declared.¹⁷⁵ It would not be possible to determine the meaning of a provision.\nWhile it would go beyond the scope of the present paper to comprehensively discuss the possibility of gaps in the law, a few remarks should suffice. Although we find instances where courts have accepted a non-liquet,¹⁷⁶ judicial practice and scholarship are generally not willing to do so.¹⁷⁷ International rules are per se shrouded by uncertainty and indeterminacy (as any legal rules).¹⁷⁸ Allowing non-liquet would question the very functionality and effectiveness of international law. The judicial function of judges requires that they concretise norms and provide definite answers to legal questions.¹⁷⁹ The plurality of subjective and objective interpretative tools offered by Articles 31–32 VCLT strongly support the view that non-liquet should not be assumed. Important in this context is Article 31(3)(1) VCLT, which provides a pathway of general principles of international law into every interpretative exercise. General principles’ main function is filling gaps in the law, that is, to avoid lacunae left by the (application of the) other sources of international law.¹⁸⁰ While the strategic inactivity of many States to publish their practice undoubtedly has negative consequences for the clarification of the jus contra bellum, it does not leave the law in limbo. The law stands despite the relative lack of States’ contribution to its clarification. Even if States establish a subsequent interpretative agreement in the sense of Article 31(1)(a) or (b) VCLT, such an agreement is only one factor among others that must be considered.\n## 4.5 The role of courts, organs of international organisations and the ILC and the lack of centralised interpretative authority Against this background, legal ambiguity in the present context is not the consequence of a gap in the law that follows from the interpretative silence of states; rather, it is a misnomer for the lack of centralised interpretative authority in international law. States are not the only relevant actors in the interpretation of international law. A number of institutional actors could potentially play an important role in the normative discourse on ‘how’ jus contra bellum applies in cyberspace, such as international courts and tribunals, organs of international organisations (most importantly UN organs), and the International Law Commission (ILC). However, none of these institutional actors has been equipped with the centralised authority to decide what the correct interpretation of the law is. As such, the clarification of the law is left to an open-ended discursive process.\n--- ¹⁷⁵. *Non liquet* transl. ‘it is not clear’.\n¹⁷⁶.

Even though the ICJ had for a while a considerable number of cases (directly or indirectly) concerning the use of force before it,¹⁸² this trend has not continued, and most of the cases did not make it to the merits.¹⁸³ Importantly for us, the Court has not dealt with questions concerning *jus contra bellum* in cyberspace and it is not likely that it will do so in the near future; other courts or tribunals that may take up the issues are also not in sight.\nWhile the UN GGE played a significant role as a facilitator of normative discourse, it has never been a platform that could have authoritatively determined the correct interpretation of the *jus contra bellum*. The UN GGE was not invested with the power to create new international law.¹⁸⁴ The reports of the UN GGE do not set legal norms themselves. Even if one supports the view that the practice of organs or sub-organs of international organisations may be directly relevant under Article 31–32 VCLT,¹⁸⁵ for example as relevant ‘subsequent practice’, good arguments speak against attaching significant weight to the practice of the UN GGE. The reports only represent the views of experts of a limited number of States (initially 15, now 25). What matters is the reception by all parties to the UN Charter and other international organs of the UN, such as the UN GA.\nThe UN GA may take up issues on *jus contra bellum* in cyberspace and has done so, for example by ‘taking note’ of the assessments and recommendations of the two first UN GGE reports (2010 and 2013) and by ‘welcoming’ the ‘conclusions’ of the third UN GGE report (2015, without a vote, meaning by consensus).¹⁸⁶ However, rather than constituting a centralised form of interpretation, the UN GA practice reflects the cumulative practice of individual States.¹⁸⁷ --- ¹⁸¹ On the role of ‘judicial decisions’ as ‘subsidiary means, see Mads Andenas and Johann R Leiss, ‘The Systemic Relevance of “Judicial Decisions” in International Law’ (2017) 77 Zeitschrift für ausländisches öffentliches Recht und Völkerrecht 907, 934–935.\n¹⁸² Cf Christine Gray, ‘The Use and Abuse of the International Court of Justice: Cases concerning the Use of Force after Nicaragua’ (2003) 14 European Journal of International Law 867.

They consider it premature to involve the ILC at this stage, since the practice of States is as yet too scarce for the ILC to carry out a meaningful analysis.¹⁹³ For the future, however, it cannot be excluded that these actors will contribute to crystallisation of the ‘correct’ interpretation of the law. While their interpretation must (also) be grounded in the will of States, they will mainly process positive manifestations of those States that have actively made their position clear or, in the absence of a clearly identifiable common and consistent practice, have recourse to the objective means of interpretation.\n# 5. Conclusion This article has discussed the politics and legal rationale behind the reluctance of some States to help clarify ‘how’ jus contra bellum applies in cyberspace. It has shown that interpretative silence may backfire in the long run. States’ silence may be interpreted – though only under strict conditions – as acquiescence to an emerging, widely accepted interpretation of the law. Moreover, objective factors beyond the subjective interpretation of States may come to the fore if too many States remain silent and thereby prevent the crystallisation of a sufficiently widely accepted interpretation of the law.\nIn light of these findings, initiatives that encourage States to make their positions publicly available are to be welcomed from a rule of law perspective.¹⁹⁴ They are also in States’ own interests. The vital role of the jus contra bellum rules for the maintenance of peace and security requires interpretative clarity to ensure their efficiency and transparency. As the UK’s Attorney General Suella Braverman stated in her speech at Chatham House in 2022: ‘The law needs to be clear and well understood if it is to be part of a framework for governing OSLO LAW REVIEW | VOLUME 9 | No.1-2022 49 international relations and to rein in irresponsible cyber behaviour’.195 If States do not preemptively clarify the law, the risk of unintended escalation of conflicts is heightened. Moreover, interpretation and development of the law would be left to military considerations that all too easily exclude other concerns.\nWhether these calls for more interpretative activity will make the UN OEWG process more successful than the UN GGE remains to be seen. It is more inclusive than the UN GGE and allows more States to be heard. However, the first impression does not seem very promising. The UN OEWG’s initial pre-draft and final report have not added anything substantive to the work of the UN GGE in matters of jus contra bellum in cyberspace.196 If the global dialogue on jus contra bellum in cyberspace remains unsuccessful, it seems likely that the path will steer away from global initiatives towards regional processes among like-minded states or even bilateral agreements.197 The US has already indicated that they would consider focusing on ‘likeminded partners’ to tackle cybersecurity issues.198 Likewise, Russia increasingly turns towards the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO).199 Other regional platforms are also becoming involved in cybersecurity issues, such as the Organization of American States, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Regional Forum, the Economic Community of West African States, the African Union, the European Union,200 the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe,201 and the Council of Europe.\nWhile the greater involvement of regional processes in the normative discourse is not a bad thing per se, the universal character of the UN Charter requires universal solutions to avoid ‘fragmentation of the international norms discourse’.202 ## Acknowledgment Work on this paper has been conducted under the aegis of the project ‘Security in Internet Governance and Networks: Analysing the Law’ (SIGNAL), funded by the Norwegian Research Council and UNINETT Norid AS.

Introduction\n\nAmong the great challenges to international law posed by the digitisation of our modern world is the fact that modern warfare has expanded into cyberspace.¹ As with any technical developments in human history, warfare has taken up new digital technologies.² Modern armies have the capability to cause death and destruction via cyberspace. At the same time, societies have become increasingly vulnerable.³ Much critical infrastructure is digitalised,\n1.

These rules apply to cyberspace.¹¹ This is confirmed by numerous statements of States and by the outputs of the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing responsible State behaviour in cyberspace in the context of international security (‘UN GGE’)¹² and the United Nations Open-Ended Working Group on Developments in the Field of ICTs in the Context of International Security (‘UN OEWG’).¹³ The 2013 consensus report of the third UN GGE noted in general terms that international law and, in particular, the UN Charter applies in cyberspace.¹⁴ The following 2015 and 2021 reports of the fourth and sixth UN GGEs made clear that the UN Charter ‘applies in its entirety’.¹⁵\nHowever, there is still much uncertainty on exactly ‘how’ these rules apply.¹⁶ To give just\n4.

For a critical discussion of this notion, see Delerue (n 1) 39–41.\n7. Roscini, *Cyber Operations and the Use of Force* (n 2) 2.\n8. ibid 1–2.\n9. Today, *jus ad bellum* is increasingly referred to as *jus contra bellum*, cf Olivier Corten, *The Law Against War: The Prohibition on the Use of Force in Contemporary International Law* (Hart 2012) passim; Delerue (n 1) 275. Note that this article is concerned with *jus contra bellum* issues but not *jus in bello* issues, the latter referring to the question of how the laws of war would govern the use of cyber-attacks during an ongoing armed conflict.\n10. Charter of the United Nations (opened for signature 26 June 1945, entered into force 24 October 1945) 3 Bevans 1153. The *jus contra bellum* also includes Chapter 7, Article 42 UN Charter, which deals with UN Security Council authorization.\n11. Cf Delerue (n 1) 1–2.\n12. The UN GGE was established in 2002 by the UN Secretary-General at the request of the UN General Assembly, cf A/Res/56/19 (2002). Since 2004, six working groups have been convened, with the last one in 2019, cf 2004/2005 A/RES/58/32 (2003); 2009/2010 A/RES/60/45 (2006); 2012/2013 A/RES/66/24 (2011); 2014/2015 A/RES/68/243 (2014); 2016/2017 A/RES/70/237 (2015); 2019/2021 A/RES/73/266 (2019). The UN GGE reports to the UN General Assembly. The UN General Assembly considered and endorsed – by consensus – the 2010, 2013 and 2015 UN GGE reports, cf A/RES/65/41 (2011); A/RES/68/243 (2014); A/RES/70/237 (2015). Up until recently, the UN GGE was the primary inter-state forum for discussions on the legal regulation of cyberspace, cf Anders Henriksen, ‘The End of the Road for the UN GGE Process: The Future Regulation of Cyberspace’ (2019) 5 (1) *Journal of Cybersecurity*, 1; Martha Finnemore and Kathryn Sikkink, ‘International Norm Dynamics and Political Change’ (1998) 52 *International Organ* 887.

The UN OEWG was established in 2018 as a second UN forum for the discussion of the regulation of cyberspace, A/RES/73/27 (2018).

What kind of activities constitute an ‘armed attack’ and might give a State cause to invoke its inherent right to self-defence (Article 51 UN Charter)?¹⁷ Where along the spectrum of permissible to impermissible conduct do various types of cyber-attacks lie? How is mere cyber-criminality to be distinguished from warfare? Should we apply the so-called ‘scale and effects’ test according to which a cyberoperation constitutes a ‘use of force’ if its scale and effects are comparable to the scale and effects of a ‘traditional’ use of kinetic force? How can we attribute use of force in cyberspace?¹⁸ More generally, how do we apply rules that are based on the existence of geographical borders, over which States exercise sovereignty, to cyberspace, in which such borders are far from distinct?¹⁹\nConsidering these open questions, it is all the more remarkable that many States shy away from actively contributing to the interpretative clarification of the law. They do not publish interpretative statements and do not make their practice of cyberwarfare public.\nPart 2 discusses the (in)activity of States to contribute to the interpretative clarification of ‘how’ jus contra bellum applies in cyberspace and discusses its negative repercussions for the work of the UN GGE and UN OEWG. Part 3 discusses possible explanations for the (legal) politics behind this interpretative silence. It argues that silence can be explained by a strategy of legal ambiguity, which finds its legal rationale in the traditional ‘freedom of State’ paradigm. The aim of this strategy is to keep the jus contra bellum in limbo and open scope for manoeuvre to cope with new technical developments and remaining strategic uncertainties in cyberwarfare.\nPart 4 discusses the (legal) consequences of interpretative silence and challenges its underlying rationale. The argument is that under the discursive framework provided by Articles 31–33 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (‘VCLT’)²⁰, the interpretation – or non-interpretation – of the parties to a treaty remains a central factor to be taken into account. However, it is only by actively contributing to the clarification of the law that States ensure their voice is heard and avoid the risk that their silence is interpreted as acquiescence. Moreover, contrary to what the freedom of State paradigm implies, the subjective interpretation of the parties is not the only ‘game in town’. Articles 31–32 VCLT and other factors complement the subjective dimension of interpretation with an objective one. The less the ‘authentic’ interpretation of the parties leads to interpretative clarification, the more the other modes of interpretation come to the fore. As such, legal ambiguity is a misnomer for the lack of centralised interpretative authority in international law. Part 5 concludes.\n---\n¹⁷ Cf Initial ‘pre-draft’ of the report of the UN OEWG <https: 03=\"\" 200311-pre-draft-oewg-ict.pdf=\"\" 2020=\"\" unoda-web.s3.amazonaws.com=\"\" wp-content=\"\" uploads=\"\" wp=\"\"> (‘UN OEWG pre-draft’) .

In its main part, the article analyses the (legal) consequences of interpretative silence and challenges its (presumably) underlying rationale – that is, a strategy of legal ambiguity based on the traditional 'freedom of State' paradigm. This article argues that it is only by actively contributing to the clarification of the law that States ensure their voice is heard and avoid the risk that their silence is interpreted as acquiescence. Moreover, contrary to what the freedom of State paradigm implies, the subjective interpretation of the parties is not the only 'game in town'. If no interpretative agreement of States crystallises, the interpretation of jus contra bellum is determined by objective factors. The article concludes by arguing that from a rule of law perspective, States should be encouraged to express their views on 'how' jus contra bellum applies in cyberspace to ensure the efficiency and transparency of these rules, which constitute part of the backbone of a peaceful co-existence and cooperation between states.\n\n## Keywords\n\njus contra bellum, cyberwarfare, treaty interpretation, acquiescence, UN GGE, UN OEWG\n\n## 1.

    "JOHANN RUBEN LEISS\n\na few instructive and much discussed examples: What kind of ICT-related activities constitute a ‘threat’ or ‘use of force’ (Article 2(4) UN Charter)? What kind of activities constitute an ‘armed attack’ and might give a State cause to invoke its inherent right to self-defence (Article 51 UN Charter)?¹⁷ Where along the spectrum of permissible to impermissible conduct do various types of cyber-attacks lie? How is mere cyber-criminality to be distinguished from warfare? Should we apply the so-called ‘scale and effects’ test according to which a cyberoperation constitutes a ‘use of force’ if its scale and effects are comparable to the scale and effects of a ‘traditional’ use of kinetic force? How can we attribute use of force in cyberspace?¹⁸ More generally, how do we apply rules that are based on the existence of geographical borders, over which States exercise sovereignty, to cyberspace, in which such borders are far from distinct?¹⁹\n\nConsidering these open questions, it is all the more remarkable that many States shy away from actively contributing to the interpretative clarification of the law. They do not publish interpretative statements and do not make their practice of cyberwarfare public.\n\nPart 2 discusses the (in)activity of States to contribute to the interpretative clarification of ‘how’ jus contra bellum applies in cyberspace and discusses its negative repercussions for the work of the UN GGE and UN OEWG. Part 3 discusses possible explanations for the (legal) politics behind this interpretative silence. It argues that silence can be explained by a strategy of legal ambiguity, which finds its legal rationale in the traditional ‘freedom of State’ paradigm. The aim of this strategy is to keep the jus contra bellum in limbo and open scope for manoeuvre to cope with new technical developments and remaining strategic uncertainties in cyberwarfare.\n\nPart 4 discusses the (legal) consequences of interpretative silence and challenges its underlying rationale. The argument is that under the discursive framework provided by Articles 31–33 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (‘VCLT’)²⁰, the interpretation – or non-interpretation – of the parties to a treaty remains a central factor to be taken into account. However, it is only by actively contributing to the clarification of the law that States ensure their voice is heard and avoid the risk that their silence is interpreted as acquiescence. Moreover, contrary to what the freedom of State paradigm implies, the subjective interpretation of the parties is not the only ‘game in town’. Articles 31–32 VCLT and other factors complement the subjective dimension of interpretation with an objective one. The less the ‘authentic’ interpretation of the parties leads to interpretative clarification, the more the other modes of interpretation come to the fore. As such, legal ambiguity is a misnomer for the lack of centralised interpretative authority in international law. Part 5 concludes.\n\n---\n\n¹⁷ Cf Initial ‘pre-draft’ of the report of the UN OEWG <https: 03=\"\" 200311-pre-draft-oewg-ict.pdf=\"\" 2020=\"\" unoda-web.s3.amazonaws.com=\"\" wp-content=\"\" uploads=\"\" wp=\"\"> (‘UN OEWG pre-draft’) [27].

    "OSLO LAW REVIEW | VOLUME 9 | No.1-2022 29\n\n## 2. Interpretative silence and jus contra bellum in cyberspace\n\n### 2.1 Jus contra bellum in cyberspace – a question of UN Charter interpretation\n\nThe present article presumes that questions concerning the application of *jus contra bellum* to cyberspace are first and foremost a matter of UN Charter interpretation. In the author’s view, the UN Charter-based *jus contra bellum* norms and their customary corollaries have merged into a single norm,²¹ even though the customary manifestation is based in a different source, and insofar remains conceptually independent from its treaty corollary.²² Article 103 UN Charter, which attaches supremacy to UN Charter law over other international law, also applies to customary international law.²³ As such, customary derogation from the UN Charter based *jus contra bellum* is excluded.\n\nUnder what conditions an interpretation of UN Charter law amounts to a modification of the rules in question must not be conclusively discussed here. While further development of the Charter by consensual re-interpretation and customary application is possible,²⁴ for the present purpose it is sufficient to keep in mind that it is not easily to be presumed that States want to circumvent the strict requirements for Charter amendments (Articles 108 and 109 UN Charter).²⁵ There are, however, notable examples of informal UN Charter modification.²⁶\n\n### 2.2 Widespread interpretative silence\n\nConsidering the overall picture, we see that many States remain reluctant to clearly position themselves and contribute to a clarification of ‘how’ *jus contra bellum* applies in cyberspace.²⁷ An increasing number of States have published ‘cyber security strategies’,²⁸ and a growing number of States have also begun to publish statements on international law in cyberspace.²⁹\n\n---\n\n21.

As such, the report did not add much to the clarification of ‘how’ jus contra bellum applies in cyberspace.⁵⁶\n\nIn 2015, a fifth group of experts was established, again with an increased number of members (now 25).⁵⁷ This time, however, the discussions proved even more difficult than in the previous rounds. In June 2017, the experts failed to agree on a draft for a consensus report.⁵⁸ As previously mentioned, one explanation is that Cuba, China and Russia opposed the inclusion of references to the application of the right to self-defence (and the general international law principles of countermeasures and international humanitarian law).⁵⁹\n\n46. ibid.\n47.

    "JOHANN RUBEN LEISS\n\nIn 2019, the sixth group (again 25 members) was established to continue the work of its predecessors.⁶⁰ The group delivered a report in 2021 and thus broke through the stalemate of the previous round.⁶¹ However, it did not add much in terms of substance to the clarification of the law. The report reaffirmed that international law, in particular the UN Charter ‘in its entirety’, applies in cyberspace (explicitly including the prohibition on the use of force) and noted again ‘the inherent right of States to take measures consistent with international law and as recognized in the Charter’.⁶²\n\nWhether the UN OEWG, as a more inclusive platform, will be more successful in clarifying the law remains to be seen. So far, the outcomes of the UN OEWG process have been rather limited. They do not go beyond the findings of the UN GGE.⁶³ In its initial pre-draft from April 2020⁶⁴ and in its final substantive report from 10 March 2021,⁶⁵ the UN OEWG noted that States reaffirmed the application of international law, and in particular UN Charter law, to cyberspace.\n\nIt would go too far to claim that the unwillingness of some States to publish their interpretations and to stay silent is the only reason for the failure of the UN GGE and the UN OEWG to provide more interpretative clarity. Interpretative activity may also lead to disagreement. However, interpretative engagement could have at least paved the way for finding common ground. This is also supported by the recommendations of the UN OEWG pre-draft and final reports, which emphasise the need for further information on the views and practice of States in relation to ‘how’ international law applies in cyberspace.⁶⁶\n\n# 3. The (legal) politics of silence\n\nHow can we explain the reluctance of States to refrain from submitting their legal positions on the interpretation of the jus contra bellum in cyberspace and the preference of some to foster new law-making instead of clarifying existing law? As States rarely explain the reasons for their silence, we can only speculate on their motives. A convincing explanation is that their choice for inactivity is driven by a preference for legal ambiguity, which finds its legal rationale in the traditional ‘freedom of State’ paradigm.\n\nThe discussion on the regulation of cyberwarfare is not only about the correct interpretation of the law but it ‘is as much about strategy, politics and ideological differences’.⁶⁷ The interpretative approaches chosen by States often reflect their broader strategical interests, which coincide with their economic, military and technical capacities.⁶⁸ Historically this has always been the case; the new reality of cyberwarfare has not changed this. How States interpret jus contra bellum in cyberspace is not independent of their respective ICT strengths and\n\n⁶⁰. A/RES/73/266 (2019).\n⁶¹. A/76/135 (2021).\n⁶². ibid [69] and [71(d)].\n⁶³.

One possible explanation is that States wait for further technical developments before they formulate their own interpretative approaches. The speed and unpredictability of the development of new digital technologies create enormous strategic uncertainties.⁷¹ While economical resources and technical capacities are also of great importance in the context of cyberwarfare, the open structure of cyberspace seems to have re-shuffled many of the old certainties. Small States with a limited budget and little conventional military power can conduct military measures which have a large-scale effect in almost every corner of the world. Despite their strong conventional military powers, traditional strong military and economic powers feel increasingly vulnerable due to their strong digital connectedness. Against the background of these strategic uncertainties, it seems to be – at least at first glance – a rational choice for States to aim at paralysing legal clarification and perpetuating legal uncertainty, as they cannot sufficiently predict the long-term consequences of their own legal interpretation.⁷²\n\nFrom a legal-theoretical perspective, this choice of strategic ambiguity can only be explained by the traditional so-called ‘freedom of State’ paradigm. This state-oriented and subjective perspective paradigm considers the freedom and the will of States paramount. It found its most famous manifestation in the Lotus dictum of the Permanent Court of International Justice in 1927. The court held that\n\ninternational law governs relations between independent States. The rules of law binding upon States therefore emanate from their own free will as expressed in conventions or by usage generally accepted as expressing principles of law and established in order to regulate the relations between these co-existing independent communities or with a view to the achievement of common aims. Restrictions on the independence of States cannot therefore presumed.⁷³\n\nFrom this perspective, States are only bound by the extent to which they have consented to the rule of international law. Not only the formation of rules, but also their interpretation, follows this paradigm. In an earlier judgment, the PCIJ stated in relation to the interpretation of international law that ‘it is an established principle that the right of giving an authoritative interpretation of a legal rule belongs solely to the person or body who has power to modify or suppress it’.⁷⁴ From this point of view, the freedom of State remains the residual rule. Indeterminacy plays into the hand of States.

Disinterest in the topic seems a rather unlikely explanation, given the great relevance of cyber security in contemporary politics. Disagreement among different branches of the government is another possible explanation.76 However, this author is not aware of any such conflicts between different branches of the government within silent States. Coercion of less powerful States to remain silent due to certain power structures and dependencies in international politics (eg of military or economic nature) may also explain their silence. However, the author is not aware of any concrete cases. A final explanation could be that some States have voiced scepticism against the UN GGE. For example, Russia has referred to the UN GGE as ‘a narrow’ and ‘elitist’ expert platform and criticised the report of the UN OEWG for its linkage to the findings of the UN GGE.77 However, this attitude does not explain a general reluctance of States to position themselves outside of the UN GGE context, for example in the more inclusive forum of the UN OEWG.\n\n## 4. The (legal) consequence of interpretative silence\n\n## 4.1 States’ interpretation as ‘subsequent practice’\n\nTo start with the obvious: no State alone can determine the law with a binding effect for itself or for others by positively interpreting it or by not interpreting it. As Weiler and Haltern have argued, ‘autointerpretation, by each state individually, is mostly accepted as a practical inevitability with little, if any, normative value’.78 While States are usually the first and often also the last interpreters of the law (in the absence of delegation of interpretative authority, for example to an international court), it is wrong to claim that ‘each State establishes for itself its legal situation vis-à-vis other States’.79 To state otherwise would go against one of the cornerstones of the international legal order: the equality of States.80 Just as a single State\n\n75.

    "JOHANN RUBEN LEISS\n\nAbsence of interpretation of some States does not necessarily stall the establishment of the authentic interpretation of the treaty provision in question. As a general rule, an ‘agreement’ in the sense of Article 31(3)(a) or (b) must be ‘established’ and therefore it must be positively identifiable.⁹¹ A ‘subsequent agreement’ (lit a) must be clearly manifested (though not necessarily in written form) and *ipso facto* constitutes an ‘authentic interpretation’.⁹² For ‘subsequent practice’ (lit b), it must be shown that the understanding is common to the parties of the treaties by evincing a ‘particular conduct or circumstances’ through which an agreement can be identified indirectly.⁹³ Therefore, ‘a subsequent agreement’ is typically easier to prove than a ‘subsequent practice’.⁹⁴\n\nA strict threshold of how many States must actively engage in a subsequent practice under lit b is difficult to establish.⁹⁵ As a general rule, the value of the subsequent practice ‘depends on the extent to which it is concordant, common and consistent’.⁹⁶ Here we can draw a parallel to the requirements of customary international law. ‘Subsequent practice’ under Article 31(3)(b) VCLT in essences equals practice under Article 38(1)(b) of the Statute of the International Court of Justice (ICJ Statute)⁹⁷.⁹⁸ The main difference is that, in the context of treaty interpretation, a ‘specific’ practice of the parties to the treaty rather than a ‘general’ practice is required.⁹⁹ The ICJ made clear that the practice of States (accompanied by the required *opinio juris*) needs to be sufficiently general for formation of a rule of customary international law.¹⁰⁰ It must be ‘extensive’,¹⁰¹ ‘sufficiently widespread’¹⁰² and ‘broadly representative’,¹⁰³ in particular by those States whose interests are ‘specially affected’.¹⁰⁴ This means that it is not required to prove a positive practice of all parties at all times.¹⁰⁵ There is no strict standard on the exact number of States’ practices that must be positively proven.¹⁰⁶\n\n⁹¹.

Other States may have done nothing, but find themselves bound by the emerging rule’.¹⁰⁸\n\nFrom this follows that relevant silence may be considered a confirmation of the developing interpretative ‘agreement’.¹⁰⁹ Under what circumstance it does so, however, remains a much-contested issue in international legal practice and scholarship.¹¹⁰\n\nThe first question is: what kind of behaviour qualifies as silence? A clear case of silence is given if a State does not express itself at all in relation to the interpretation of a treaty and any of its provisions. Such behaviour qualifies as a verbal omission and therefore silence.¹¹¹ Generally, statements on the non-application of a treaty or a rule may qualify as relevant ‘subsequent practice’ and do not constitute silence.¹¹² A sufficient detailedness of the interpretative statement is not required. Inconsistent subsequent practice can be precluded from having a normative effect under the principle of estoppel.¹¹³ Hence, claims by some States that Article 51 UN Charter does not apply in cyberspace are devoid of normative effect, if these States have earlier acknowledged that the UN Charter applies in cyberspace.\n\nThe second question is whether the State’s intention to confirm a certain interpretation through its silence is decisive or whether we should apply objective criteria and rely on the recipient’s perspective.¹¹⁴ In a nutshell, voluntarists argue that States’ silence only has the legal effect that conforms to the will of the silent State.¹¹⁵ For those who support an objective\n\n107.

    "JOHANN RUBEN LEISS\n\napproach,¹¹⁶ silence is first and foremost a fact and the legal effect follows from ‘legitimate expectations of other actors’ which can be inferred from the context.¹¹⁷ For example, Starski argues that ‘silence will never reveal the true beliefs of an actor: “belief” will necessarily be constructed merely from the contextual setting’.¹¹⁸ In addition, she suggests that international law imposes on States a ‘legislative responsibility’ to engage in active interpretation if the circumstances have called for some reaction to ensure international law’s effectivity and legal certainty.¹¹⁹ This ‘legislative responsibility’ is only a soft obligation (in German ‘Obliegenheit’, which can be translated into ‘incumbency’)¹²⁰ that is not enforceable and sanctionable. Attaching legal effect to States’ silence is a compensation for the ‘soft’ character of this ‘legislative responsibility’.¹²¹ In Starski’s view, such responsibility follows inter alia from a ‘constitutionalist’ reading of international law.¹²² In her view, the ‘eminent’ role of States in the process of law creation and evolution ‘endows states with a specific responsibility towards the effectivity of the international legal system’ which depends on a clarification of the law.¹²³ Only determinacy makes norms operational and allows us to distinguish law from non-law.¹²⁴\n\nStarski’s argument has merits for several reasons. To start with, the principle of good faith reflected in Article 31(1) VCLT requires States to fulfil their obligation as parties to a treaty, not to impede the effect of the treaty by perpetuating indeterminacy (under certain circumstances, as discussed below).¹²⁵\n\nWhile a ‘constitutionalist’ reading of international law invoked by Starski comes with challenges,¹²⁶ the ‘legislative responsibility takes account of the shift from a purely State-oriented international legal order of co-existence towards a legal order of cooperation that does not only serve States’ interests but also interests of an alleged ‘international commu\n\nGeneral Principles and Sources of Law’ (1953) 30 British Year Book of International Law 1, 68; Jacques Bentz, ‘Le silence comme manifestation de volonté en Droit international public’ (1963) 67 Revue Général de Droit International Public 44, 45.\n\n116.

As the ILC noted, ‘acceptance of a practice by one or more parties by way of silence or inaction is not easily established’.¹²⁹ In order to find a fair balance between the objectification of silence and consensualist concerns, a close scrutiny of the context and setting of the silence is required.¹³⁰ The important qualification is that we can infer consent from silence only – independent of the real intention of the State – if the ‘circumstances were such as called for some reaction’.¹³¹ Only if she must and can speak (*si loqui debuisset ac potuisset*), the neutral maxim that ‘she who keeps silent is held neither to deny nor to accept’ (*qui tacit neque negat, neque utique fatetur*) yields to the maxim that ‘she who keeps silent is held to consent’ (*qui tacit consentire videtur*).¹³²\n\nThe ILC has pointed to two factors that must be considered to establish whether the circumstances ‘called for some reaction’: ‘the legal situation to which the subsequent practice by the other party relates and the claim thereby expressed’.¹³³ If we break down these two broad criteria into more specific sub-criteria, we can identify nine factors that should be taken into account.¹³⁴\n\nThe first factor that should be considered is the nature of the State practice itself.¹³⁵ It is relevant whether the interpretative action was a singular event or whether it occurred frequently.¹³⁶ Moreover, it is relevant whether the interpretative action is consistent and whether it has become commonplace.¹³⁷ In this context, the element of time must also be considered: the longer States engage in a certain action, the higher the expectation is that other States react.¹³⁸\n\n127.

As Starski convincingly argues,\n\n[t]he very purpose of erga omnes norms would appear to be undermined if the non-protest of bystander states in light of their violation might more easily have a law-altering effect than in the case of ‘ordinary’ rules. ... The erga omnes dimension of norms creates a – rather fictitious – locus standi, but only to the benefit of a norm’s enforceability and not in order to enhance its alterability.¹⁵⁴\n\nThe eighth factor to be considered is ‘timeliness’.¹⁵⁵ The greater the impact of the proposed interpretation is on interests and rights of a State, the more it is to be expected that it responds in a timely manner.¹⁵⁶\n\nThe ninth and final factor concerns the nature of the affected rules in question.¹⁵⁷ If the rule in question enjoys a jus cogens or erga omnes status, the threshold for modification is set high. Jus cogens norms require a near-universal State practice and can only be substituted by a norm of the same nature (Article 53 VCLT). As such, silence ‘can only under very limited circumstances issue law formative effects in cases in which peremptory norms are at stake if the very concept of jus cogens is to be kept doctrinally intact’.¹⁵⁸\n\nIf we apply these standards to the practice of States to the discourse on jus contra bellum in cyberspace, it seems premature to conclude that the silence of States that have not engaged with interpretative proposals made by other States amounts to acquiescence in all contexts.\n\nTo give one illustrative example: many of those States that have published interpretative statements have endorsed the so-called ‘scale and effects’ test (or a version thereof)¹⁵⁹ that is based on the Nicaragua judgment of the ICJ.¹⁶⁰ Under the ‘scale and effects’ test, a cyber-operation constitutes a ‘use of force’ if its scale and effects are comparable to the scale and effects of a ‘traditional’ use of kinetic force.¹⁶¹\n\nDoes the silence of some States on whether they agree with this interpretation of the law amount to legally relevant acquiescence? Were the circumstances such that they called for some reaction according to the aforementioned standards?\n\nSeveral of those standards are met. Mere verbal and written statements may constitute relevant ‘subsequent practice’. Article 31(3)(b) VCLT does not require a physical action as\n\n(commentaries on Articles 48(1)(a) and 48(1)(b)).

The silent States had the capacity to act and were (or at least ought to be) aware of these interpretative statements (third factor). The statements were made in internationally significant contexts, such as before the UN GGE and UN OEWG, or through official channels, including homepages of ministries of foreign affairs, or other public fora (fourth factor). The jus contra bellum also consists of rules that are by their very nature volatile (fifth factor).\n\nHowever, if we look at the other relevant factors, it seems doubtful that the circumstances were already such that they called for some reaction. Arguably, the interpretative statements in relation to the ‘scale’ and ‘effect’ test are not sufficiently consistent and widespread (first factor). While there seems to be an agreement on the overall contours of this test and its applicability in cyberspace, there still seems disagreement on its precise scope, for example in relation to the question of whether cyber-operations causing severe non-physical consequences, such as an attack on the nation’s economic system, may also reach the threshold of a use of force. Several States seem to be in favour of this interpretation.¹⁶³ Others, however, seem to be sceptical or leave this question open.¹⁶⁴ It also seems doubtful that a sufficient number of States have publicly subscribed to an application of this test. The subsequent practice must be ‘extensive’¹⁶⁵ and ‘sufficiently widespread’¹⁶⁶ and ‘broadly representative’¹⁶⁷ among States, in particular those whose interests are ‘specially affected’.¹⁶⁸ While the number of States supporting this test is relatively large and seems to be growing, it does not comprise the majority of UN Member States yet. However, it is not unlikely that the relevant threshold will be met in the future, which would increase the expectation of reactions of bystanders.\n\nMoreover, most States who have begun to position themselves in favour of an application of the ‘scale’ and ‘effect’ in cyberspace test have done so only quite recently (first and eighth factor). The UN OEWG process, in whose context many States have made their statements, has also been only established relatively recently. However, the longer the UN OEWG process is ongoing, the higher the expectation is that other States react to interpretative proposals.\n\nAs the interpretative proposals relate to the UN Charter and potentially impact rights and interests of all States, one could argue that a reaction can be expected (sixth factor). On the other hand, as has been discussed above, the fact that the UN Charter jus contra bellum rules constitute erga omnes obligations and jus cogens¹⁶⁹ speaks against inferring too easily\n\n162.

If the rule in question enjoys a *jus cogens* or *erga omnes* status, the threshold for a conclusive interpretation is set very high.\n\nIn conclusion, good arguments speak in favour of not (yet) qualifying the silence as acquiescence to interpretations that support the ‘scale’ and ‘effect’ test. However, these findings are only a snapshot of the current situation. The more a common position crystallises among a sufficient number of states on the interpretation of the *jus contra bellum* in cyberspace (or specific elements thereof), the more that silent States need to position themselves to avoid their silence being interpreted as acquiescence.\n\nMoreover, as discussed in the next section, the lack of an interpretative agreement on the ‘scale’ and ‘effect’ test does not necessarily leave the law in limbo as objective interpretative factors must also be considered. International lawyers are justified in making an argument in favour of applying the ‘scale’ and ‘effect’ test to cyberspace on the basis of the wording, objective and purpose of the UN Charter, in light of ICJ jurisprudence (Article 38(1)(d) ICJ Statute).\n\n## 4.3 The interplay between subjective and objective factors in UN Charter interpretation\n\nContrary to what the freedom of State paradigm implies, the subjective interpretation of the parties of ‘how’ the UN Charter *jus contra bellum* applies in cyberspace is not the sole factor at play. The subjective interpretation of States is complemented by objective factors, including the ‘ordinary meaning’ of the terms of the treaty (Article 31(1) VCLT), the treaty’s ‘context’ and ‘object and purpose’ (Article 31(1) VCLT), agreements and instruments made with the conclusion of the treaty (Article 31(2) VCLT), and other ‘relevant rules of international law applicable in relations between the parties’ (Article 31(3)(c) VCLT). In treaty interpretation, subjective and objective factors do not stand in a hierarchical relationship with each other; their order merely represents the logical process of interpretation.¹⁷⁰ Subsequent practice is often used in interplay with the other means of interpretation in a ‘single combined operation’.¹⁷¹ At least, this observation holds true with regard to the practice of the ICJ.¹⁷²\n\nThe complementary interplay of subjective and objective elements in the interpretation of treaties that follows from Article 31 VLCT takes account of the shift from a purely State-oriented international legal order of co-existence towards a legal order of cooperation that has been discussed above.¹⁷³ While the traditional bilateral structure remains the basis to avoid international law sliding into utopianism, treaties have a normative force that is independent from States’ will.¹⁷⁴\n\n---\n\n¹⁷⁰.

    "JOHANN RUBEN LEISS\n\nExclusive reliance on the will of States in treaty interpretation would easily lead to gaps in the law if States do not develop a common understanding. In such circumstances, a non-liquet would have to be declared.¹⁷⁵ It would not be possible to determine the meaning of a provision.\n\nWhile it would go beyond the scope of the present paper to comprehensively discuss the possibility of gaps in the law, a few remarks should suffice. Although we find instances where courts have accepted a non-liquet,¹⁷⁶ judicial practice and scholarship are generally not willing to do so.¹⁷⁷ International rules are per se shrouded by uncertainty and indeterminacy (as any legal rules).¹⁷⁸ Allowing non-liquet would question the very functionality and effectiveness of international law. The judicial function of judges requires that they concretise norms and provide definite answers to legal questions.¹⁷⁹ The plurality of subjective and objective interpretative tools offered by Articles 31–32 VCLT strongly support the view that non-liquet should not be assumed. Important in this context is Article 31(3)(1) VCLT, which provides a pathway of general principles of international law into every interpretative exercise. General principles’ main function is filling gaps in the law, that is, to avoid lacunae left by the (application of the) other sources of international law.¹⁸⁰\n\nWhile the strategic inactivity of many States to publish their practice undoubtedly has negative consequences for the clarification of the jus contra bellum, it does not leave the law in limbo. The law stands despite the relative lack of States’ contribution to its clarification. Even if States establish a subsequent interpretative agreement in the sense of Article 31(1)(a) or (b) VCLT, such an agreement is only one factor among others that must be considered.\n\n## 4.5 The role of courts, organs of international organisations and the ILC and the lack of centralised interpretative authority\n\nAgainst this background, legal ambiguity in the present context is not the consequence of a gap in the law that follows from the interpretative silence of states; rather, it is a misnomer for the lack of centralised interpretative authority in international law. States are not the only relevant actors in the interpretation of international law. A number of institutional actors could potentially play an important role in the normative discourse on ‘how’ jus contra bellum applies in cyberspace, such as international courts and tribunals, organs of international organisations (most importantly UN organs), and the International Law Commission (ILC). However, none of these institutional actors has been equipped with the centralised authority to decide what the correct interpretation of the law is. As such, the clarification of the law is left to an open-ended discursive process.\n\n---\n\n¹⁷⁵. *Non liquet* transl. ‘it is not clear’.\n\n¹⁷⁶.

    "OSLO LAW REVIEW | VOLUME 9 | No.1-2022 47\n\nInternational court and tribunals, in particular the ICJ, could potentially play an important role in clarifying the law through their judicial decisions as ‘subsidiary means’ under Article 38(1)(d) ICJ Statute.¹⁸¹ However, in matters of *jus contra bellum* in cyberspace, international courts and tribunals often lack the jurisdiction to provide interpretative clarification. Even though the ICJ had for a while a considerable number of cases (directly or indirectly) concerning the use of force before it,¹⁸² this trend has not continued, and most of the cases did not make it to the merits.¹⁸³ Importantly for us, the Court has not dealt with questions concerning *jus contra bellum* in cyberspace and it is not likely that it will do so in the near future; other courts or tribunals that may take up the issues are also not in sight.\n\nWhile the UN GGE played a significant role as a facilitator of normative discourse, it has never been a platform that could have authoritatively determined the correct interpretation of the *jus contra bellum*. The UN GGE was not invested with the power to create new international law.¹⁸⁴ The reports of the UN GGE do not set legal norms themselves. Even if one supports the view that the practice of organs or sub-organs of international organisations may be directly relevant under Article 31–32 VCLT,¹⁸⁵ for example as relevant ‘subsequent practice’, good arguments speak against attaching significant weight to the practice of the UN GGE. The reports only represent the views of experts of a limited number of States (initially 15, now 25). What matters is the reception by all parties to the UN Charter and other international organs of the UN, such as the UN GA.\n\nThe UN GA may take up issues on *jus contra bellum* in cyberspace and has done so, for example by ‘taking note’ of the assessments and recommendations of the two first UN GGE reports (2010 and 2013) and by ‘welcoming’ the ‘conclusions’ of the third UN GGE report (2015, without a vote, meaning by consensus).¹⁸⁶ However, rather than constituting a centralised form of interpretation, the UN GA practice reflects the cumulative practice of individual States.¹⁸⁷\n\n---\n\n¹⁸¹ On the role of ‘judicial decisions’ as ‘subsidiary means, see Mads Andenas and Johann R Leiss, ‘The Systemic Relevance of “Judicial Decisions” in International Law’ (2017) 77 Zeitschrift für ausländisches öffentliches Recht und Völkerrecht 907, 934–935.\n\n¹⁸² Cf Christine Gray, ‘The Use and Abuse of the International Court of Justice: Cases concerning the Use of Force after Nicaragua’ (2003) 14 European Journal of International Law 867.

    "JOHANN RUBEN LEISS\n\nThe UN Security Council may also contribute to the interpretation of the jus contra bellum.¹⁸⁸ However, to date the UN Security Council has not taken up the issue.¹⁸⁹ Moreover, UN Security Council resolutions do not represent an authoritative interpretation of the UN Charter that binds States beyond the individual case and often require further interpretation by the member States of the UN.¹⁹⁰\n\nThe ILC is another institution that potentially plays a role in clarifying (and even developing) the jus contra bellum in cyberspace.¹⁹¹ However, the suggestion to refer the issue to the ILC that was included in the initial pre-draft report of the OEWG¹⁹² was met by scepticism of several States. They consider it premature to involve the ILC at this stage, since the practice of States is as yet too scarce for the ILC to carry out a meaningful analysis.¹⁹³\n\nFor the future, however, it cannot be excluded that these actors will contribute to crystallisation of the ‘correct’ interpretation of the law. While their interpretation must (also) be grounded in the will of States, they will mainly process positive manifestations of those States that have actively made their position clear or, in the absence of a clearly identifiable common and consistent practice, have recourse to the objective means of interpretation.\n\n# 5. Conclusion\n\nThis article has discussed the politics and legal rationale behind the reluctance of some States to help clarify ‘how’ jus contra bellum applies in cyberspace. It has shown that interpretative silence may backfire in the long run. States’ silence may be interpreted – though only under strict conditions – as acquiescence to an emerging, widely accepted interpretation of the law. Moreover, objective factors beyond the subjective interpretation of States may come to the fore if too many States remain silent and thereby prevent the crystallisation of a sufficiently widely accepted interpretation of the law.\n\nIn light of these findings, initiatives that encourage States to make their positions publicly available are to be welcomed from a rule of law perspective.¹⁹⁴ They are also in States’ own interests. The vital role of the jus contra bellum rules for the maintenance of peace and security requires interpretative clarity to ensure their efficiency and transparency.

Moreover, interpretation and development of the law would be left to military considerations that all too easily exclude other concerns.\n\nWhether these calls for more interpretative activity will make the UN OEWG process more successful than the UN GGE remains to be seen. It is more inclusive than the UN GGE and allows more States to be heard. However, the first impression does not seem very promising. The UN OEWG’s initial pre-draft and final report have not added anything substantive to the work of the UN GGE in matters of jus contra bellum in cyberspace.196\n\nIf the global dialogue on jus contra bellum in cyberspace remains unsuccessful, it seems likely that the path will steer away from global initiatives towards regional processes among like-minded states or even bilateral agreements.197 The US has already indicated that they would consider focusing on ‘likeminded partners’ to tackle cybersecurity issues.198 Likewise, Russia increasingly turns towards the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO).199 Other regional platforms are also becoming involved in cybersecurity issues, such as the Organization of American States, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Regional Forum, the Economic Community of West African States, the African Union, the European Union,200 the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe,201 and the Council of Europe.\n\nWhile the greater involvement of regional processes in the normative discourse is not a bad thing per se, the universal character of the UN Charter requires universal solutions to avoid ‘fragmentation of the international norms discourse’.202\n\n## Acknowledgment\n\nWork on this paper has been conducted under the aegis of the project ‘Security in Internet Governance and Networks: Analysing the Law’ (SIGNAL), funded by the Norwegian Research Council and UNINETT Norid AS.

    "abstract": "This article explores the (in)activity of many States in contributing to the interpretative clarification of 'how' jus contra bellum applies in cyberspace, its negative repercussions for the work of the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing responsible State behaviour in cyberspace in the context of international security (UN GGE) and the United Nations Open-Ended Working Group on Developments in the Field of ICTs in the Context of International Security (UN OEWG), and the way forward. In its main part, the article analyses the (legal) consequences of interpretative silence and challenges its (presumably) underlying rationale – that is, a strategy of legal ambiguity based on the traditional 'freedom of State' paradigm. This article argues that it is only by actively contributing to the clarification of the law that States ensure their voice is heard and avoid the risk that their silence is interpreted as acquiescence. Moreover, contrary to what the freedom of State paradigm implies, the subjective interpretation of the parties is not the only 'game in town'. If no interpretative agreement of States crystallises, the interpretation of jus contra bellum is determined by objective factors. The article concludes by arguing that from a rule of law perspective, States should be encouraged to express their views on 'how' jus contra bellum applies in cyberspace to ensure the efficiency and transparency of these rules, which constitute part of the backbone of a peaceful co-existence and cooperation between states.",
