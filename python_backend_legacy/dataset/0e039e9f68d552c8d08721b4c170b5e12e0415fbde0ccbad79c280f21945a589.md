On the basis of this assumption, the author inquires into possible principles and rules established in general international law which could be relied on in order to address cyber security incidents, i.e. inter-State conflicts relating to cyberspace which remain below the threshold of the notions of use of force or armed conflict.\nRelying mainly on principles established in international environmental law, it is argued that the principle of good neighbourliness is the most promising candidate for developing obligations of cooperation and assistance in dealing with malicious cyber activities. However, one crucial difference between hazardous activities relating to the environment and threats in cyberspace is spelled out: In contrast to activities with potential dangers for the environment, with regard to the internet it is impossible to distinguish 'hazardous' activities from non-hazardous activities. For this reason it is impossible to establish thresholds or activities in cyberspace which could serve as triggers for preventive obligations. As a consequence, the focus must be laid on obligations of cooperation and assistance during and after a cyber security incident, rather than at the preventive stage.\nKEYWORDS: Cyber Security, Good Neighbourliness, Corfu Channel Case, Burden of Proof, Prevention, Obligations of Cooperation\n## I. Introduction\nThe internet presents many challenges to international law. Its virtual character is considered to put into question the principle of territoriality which in many areas is fundamental to international law as it currently stands. The rapidity of cyber activity requires swift and often coordinated if not collective action by more than one State.\n* Professor for Public and Public International Law, Institute for International Law, Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Munich.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58 · 2015\nFinally, private actors play an important role. This means, on the one side, that issues of State responsibility for private activities have to be addressed, and on the other, that human rights issues must be taken into account. All of this does not fit easily into the inter-State paradigm of mutual obligations between States. The following considerations thus necessarily are of a preliminary, explorative character.\n## II. General Assumptions\n## A. Concerning the Role of States\nA first general assumption relates to the role of States in regulating the internet. In contrast to some positions in literature, in the following the internet is not viewed as a legal space which is distinct from the territory of States and thus subject to its own, independent legal regime. The internet certainly has an important transnational dimension, but that does not mean that it is intrinsically transnational and cannot be made subject to regulations from individual States. Rather, the following considerations are based on a territorial approach according to which ‘the Internet’ is viewed as being – at least in most parts – covered by the authority of the State on whose territory a specific activity in question takes place, i.e. where a person physically conducts his or her malicious activity or where a server or computer on which the activity takes place is located.¹\nSpecific problems may arise in the context of data which move frequently between different servers and different locations. Given the frequency and rapidity with which the location of data may be changed, the situation of such data has been described as a “loss of location”.² However, these specific problems of ‘data in the cloud(s)’ may\n¹ Eneken Tikk, Ten Rules for Cyber Security, Survival: Global Politics and Strategy 53 (2011), 119, 121; Johann-Christoph Woltag, Computer Network Operations Below the Level of Armed Force, European Society of International Law (ESIL) Conference Paper No. 1/2011, 12, available via: http://www.esil-sedi.eu/node/697 (accessed on 31 October 2015); Benedikt Pirker, Territorial Integrity and the Challenges of Cyberspace, in: Katharina Ziolkowski (ed.), Peacetime Regime for State Activities in Cyberspace (2013), 189, 193 et seq. For a similar approach see Art. 22 (1)(a)–(c) Convention on Cybercrime, 23 November 2001, ETS No. 185 (Budapest Convention); specific problems of activities in internationalised territories such as the high seas are left aside, given their presumably small practical relevance.\n² Council of Europe, Economic Crime Division, Cloud Computing and Cybercrime Investigations: Territoriality vs. the Power of Disposal?, Discussion Paper, 31 August 2010, available at: rm.coe.int/\nOBLIGATIONS OF STATES 69\nrequire specific methods of inquiry and access, but they do not change the fundamental principle of territoriality.\n## B. Concerning the Term ‘Cyber Security Incident’\nThe term ‘cyber security incident’ is vague. It competes with other notions such as ‘cyber warfare’, ‘cyber terrorism’, ‘cyber conflict’, ‘cyber threat’, ‘cyber crime’, or ‘cyber attack’.³ Some of these terms go along with certain strategies to ensure cyber security:⁴ ‘Cyber crime’ suggests a criminal law approach, ‘cyber warfare’ obviously alludes to use of force and international humanitarian law, etc.\n‘Cyber security incident’ may cover incidents as different as the distributed denial of service attack (DDoS) on the Estonian public computer system in 2007,⁵ the Stuxnet worm, which was apparently specifically designed for halting the Iranian nuclear programme,⁶ the hacking of computer systems of private companies for the purpose of industrial espionage and other cases of internet torts,⁷ hacktivist actions for the promotion of political ideas,⁸ etc. One could even include the military dimension under the label of ‘cyber security incident’. However, given that most malicious cyber activity does not reach the level of armed force, only incidents remaining below\nCoERM Public Common Search Services / Display DCTM Content? document Id=09000016802fa3df (accessed on 31 October 2015); see also Cybercrime Convention Committee (T-CY), (Draft) Elements of an Additional Protocol to the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime regarding transborder access to data, 9 April 2013, T-CY (2013)14, available at: https://www.coe.int/t/dghl/cooperation/economic crime/Source/Cybercrime/TCY/TCY%202013/T-CY%282013%2914transb_elements_protocol_V2.pdf (accessed on 11 November 2015).\n³ See, for an attempt to clarify the relationship of several competing notions, Oona A.

In order to further clarify the notion of ‘cyber security incident’, it is helpful to look at the Convention on Cybercrime (Budapest Convention).¹⁰\n## C. The CoE Convention on Cybercrime (Budapest Convention)\nA few words concerning the Budapest Convention are in place by way of introduction: The Convention is the most comprehensive binding international document relating to cyber security.¹¹ Currently the Budapest Convention has 47 parties, among them several States who are not members of the Council of Europe (USA, Japan, Australia, and the Dominican Republic). There are further non-European signatories which have not yet ratified the Convention (Canada and South Africa). The Convention follows a criminal law approach and seeks to harmonise national laws by defining certain computer-related offences and setting minimum standards for the methods of their investigation and concerning the cooperation between States.¹²\nThe definition covers offences against the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of computer-related data and systems (Articles 2–6 Budapest Convention), computer-related offences (forgery and fraud, Articles 7 and 8 Budapest Convention), content-related offences (child pornography, Article 9 Budapest Convention), and finally offences relating to infringements of copyright and related rights (Article 10 Budapest Convention).\n⁹ Charter of the United Nations, 26 June 1945, UNCIO 15, 335 (UN Charter).\n¹⁰ See supra, note 1. For a recent account of the Convention see Sophie Kwasny, Lutte contre la cybercriminalité et respect des droits de l'homme: Les instruments du Conseil de l'Europe, in: Société Française Pour le Droit International (ed.), Internet et le droit international: Colloque de Rouen (2014), 339.\n¹¹ See e.g. Paul Rosenzweig, International Law and Private Actor Active Cyber Defensive Measures, Stanford Journal of International Law 50 (2014), 103, 108; Hathaway et al. (note 3), 862.\n¹² For an analysis see Michael A. Vatis, The Council of Europe Convention on Cyber Crime, in: National Research Council (ed.), Proceedings of a Workshop on Deterring Cyber-Attacks: Informing Strategies and Developing Options for U.S. Policy (2010), 207; Robert Uerpmann-Wittzack, Internet-völkerrecht, Archiv des Völkerrechts 47 (2009), 261, 269–270.\nOBLIGATIONS OF STATES 71\nDue to its criminal law approach, the Budapest Convention includes issues which are not related to inter-State security or to obligations incumbent upon States to ensure that their territories are not used for purposes which are harmful to other States. A more limited approach is therefore warranted for the purposes of this contribution. Accordingly, I propose to limit the notion of ‘cyber security incident’ to those crimes which relate to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of computer data and systems. A cyber security incident thus occurs whenever computers or computer systems are illegally accessed or destroyed or when data are illegally intercepted, deleted, or altered.\n## III. General Obligations of Prevention\nThe first phase of possible obligations relates to the situation prior to a cyber security incident. In this phase obligations of prevention are of interest. These aspects will be dealt with first (III.). In a second step obligations of cooperation and information will be dealt with (IV.). These obligations are mostly relevant during or after a cyber security incident has occurred.\n## A. Principle of Non-Intervention\nThe most fundamental principle applicable is the principle of non-intervention. According to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) it is “part and parcel of customary international law”.¹³ When a State uses the internet in order to destabilise another country, this constitutes a violation of the principle of non-intervention. Similarly, cyber-based activities of organs of one State on computers situated in another country or relating to parts of the web situated in another country would infringe upon the latter country’s sovereignty.\nIn this area, issues such as attribution, standards of proof, etc. are more important than the substantive law, which is quite clear. In that regard, it is necessary to distinguish between computers and computer systems belonging to the government and\n¹³ International Court of Justice (ICJ), *Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua* (Nicaragua v. United States of America), Merits, Judgment of 27 June 1986, ICJ Reports 1986, para. 202.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58 · 2015\ncomputers and computer systems owned and operated by private individuals or companies. Computers belonging to the government may be presumed to be controlled by the government. Ideas for distributing responsibility under such circumstances may be borrowed from the jurisprudence and practice of human rights bodies regarding persons who are in complete control of State agents.\nThe European Court of Human Rights, for instance, argues as follows:\nWhere the events in issue lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of persons within their control in custody, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries and death occurring during such detention. Indeed, the burden of proof may be regarded as resting on the authorities to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation.^[14]^\nThe factor of exclusive control was also taken into consideration by the ICJ in developing its standard of proof in the Corfu Channel case:\n[...] the fact of this exclusive territorial control exercised by a State within its frontiers has a bearing upon the methods of proof available to establish the knowledge of that State as to such events. By reason of this exclusive control, the other State, the victim of a breach of international law, is often unable to furnish direct proof of facts giving rise to responsibility. Such a State should be allowed a more liberal recourse to inferences of fact and circumstantial evidence. This indirect evidence is admitted in all systems of law, and its use is recognized by international decisions. It must be regarded as of special weight when it is based on a series of facts linked together and leading logically to a single conclusion.^[15]^\nActivities on computers owned by the government are “within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities.” Hence, the following assumption may be made: Where a malicious cyber activity creating a cyber security incident can be traced back to a government computer or computer system, the activity may be attributed to the government, unless it provides a satisfactory and convincing explanation that the system was externally used (i.e. has been hacked by someone else).^[16]^\n^[14] European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR), Salman v.

No-Harm Principle\nIn the *Corfu Channel* case the ICJ assumed a general duty to prevent harm. The Court ruled on a general principle to prevent harm as one of the bases for an Albanian duty to warn the British government: “[...] every State’s obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States.”¹⁹\nThe general principle has been developed in more detail in the area of international environmental law where good neighbourliness and a duty to prevent harm are considered to be part of customary law.²⁰ The main sources for this principle are the famous *Trail Smelter* arbitration²¹ and Principle 21 Stockholm Declaration/Principle 2 Rio Declaration.²²\n---\n¹⁷ International Law Commission (ILC), Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, GAOR, 56th Sess., Suppl. 10, 43 et seq.\n¹⁸ Cf. also Terry D. Gill, *Non-Intervention in the Cyber Context*, in: Ziolkowski (ed.)

(note 7).\n²² The Stockholm Declaration’s wording: “States have, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and the principles of international law, the sovereign right to exploit their own resources pursuant to their own environmental policies, and the responsibility to ensure that activities within their jurisdiction or control do not cause damage to the environment of other States or of areas beyond the limits of national jurisdiction”, Stockholm Declaration of the United Nations Conference\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58 · 2015\nThese principles allow for the inclusion of harm caused by private actors.²³ In the *Corfu Channel* case mere knowledge by the Albanian authorities of the danger was sufficient, and in the *Trail Smelter* case the pollution emanated from a private plant. Thus, the principles of good neighbourliness and the duty to prevent harm extend the responsibility of States for private action beyond the strict criteria of Article 8 Articles on State Responsibility. To put the issue more generally: Responsibility of States for private action is not only caused by criteria of attribution, i.e. within the law of State responsibility, but also by the character of the primary obligations of States. Obligations of control and surveillance entail an indirect responsibility for private action if they are not respected. This reflects that there is an interaction in the law of State responsibility between the issue of attribution on the one side and the scope of the obligation of the State on the other.²⁴ In terms of the practical outcome, obligations of surveillance and control may thus constitute a substitute for the attribution of private action to a State.\nThe consequences which flow from the overall responsibility of States for harmful activities on their territory are, however, mitigated to some extent by additional criteria.\nFirst, the *Corfu Channel* formula requires “knowledge” on part of the State concerned. While the ICJ could operate with certain assumptions regarding the overall control of the territorial waters,²⁵ such an overall control certainly cannot be assumed with respect to any cyber activity on the territory of a given State.²⁶ Hence, the requirement of “knowledge” of the harmful activity will only be met in rare cases.\non the Human Environment, UN Doc.

Drumbl*, Trail Smelter and the International Law Commission’s Work on State Responsibility for Internationally Wrongful Acts and State Liability, in: Bratspies/Miller (eds.)

It does not seem to be excluded, however, that these criteria are met in the context of cyber security incidents. For example, it has been argued that the DDoS attack on Estonia in 2007 constituted a case of “serious consequence”.²⁸ Irrespective of that it is today mostly recognised that international environmental law has developed beyond the Trail Smelter requirements.²⁹ Thus, the no-harm rule as it currently stands in customary international law only requires a certain *de minimis* threshold to be fulfilled³⁰ and the precautionary principle may be considered to have alleviated the strict Trail Smelter standard of proof.³¹\nFinally, the Trail Smelter principle is further mitigated by the requirement of due diligence.³² Today “there is a clear consensus that although the no-harm principle does not say so explicitly, a State can only breach the principle if it fails to act with due diligence.”³³ According to the ILC in its Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities (Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm) both the magnitude and the probability of harm are to be taken\n²⁷ For further elaboration on this see Russell A.

Hence, preventive action by States is both factually and legally considerably limited.\n## C. Precautionary Principle\nA similar scepticism relates to the precautionary principle, which would be the most obvious candidate for imposing preventive action. Indeed, the precautionary\n³⁴ See the commentary to Art. 3 Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm, para. 11: “The standard of due diligence against which the conduct of the State of origin should be examined is that which is generally considered to be appropriate and proportional to the degree of risk of transboundary harm in the particular instance. For example, activities which may be considered ultrahazardous require a much higher standard of care in designing policies and a much higher degree of vigour on the part of the State to enforce them. Issues such as the size of the operation; its location, special climate conditions, materials used in the activity, and whether the conclusions drawn from the application of these factors in a specific case are reasonable, are among the factors to be considered in determining the due diligence requirement in each instance. What would be considered a reasonable standard of care or due diligence may change with time; what might be considered an appropriate and reasonable procedure, standard or rule at one point in time may not be considered as such at some point in the future. Hence, due diligence in ensuring safety requires a State to keep abreast of technological changes and scientific developments” (II.C, Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities, with Commentaries (2001), Report on the Work of its 53rd Session, UN Doc. A/56/10 (2001), 377); see also the definition of “risk of causing significant transboundary harm” in Art. 2 Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm: “The definition refers to two types of activities under these articles. One is where there is a low probability of causing disastrous harm. This is normally the characteristic of ultrahazardous activities. The other one is where there is a high probability of causing significant harm. This includes activities which have a high probability of causing harm which, while not disastrous, is still significant. But it would exclude activities where there is a very low probability of causing significant transboundary harm.” (ibid., commentary para. 3).\n³⁵ Beyerlin/Marauhn (note 32), 43.\n³⁶ For a discussion of the due diligence standard’s applicability in cyberspace regulation (with reference to the ‘duty of prevention’) see also Pirker (note 1), 206–209.\nOBLIGATIONS OF STATES 77\nprinciple has assumed a prominent place in modern international law.³⁷ Although its legal basis in customary law is still being questioned,³⁸ there are clear indications to the contrary, notably regarding environmental impact assessments. The requirement to undertake an environmental impact assessment has been considered to be rooted in customary international law by several international decisions. The most prominent among them is the *Pulp Mills* case of the ICJ where the Court held that\n[...] it may now be considered a requirement under general international law to undertake an environmental impact assessment where there is a risk that the proposed industrial activity may have a significant adverse impact in a transboundary context [...].³⁹\nSimilar approaches were taken by arbitral tribunals in the *Iron Rhine Arbitration*⁴⁰ and the *Indus Waters Project*.⁴¹ It may therefore be assumed that at least in form of an environmental impact assessment the precautionary principle has entered general international law.\n³⁷ Jonathan B. Wiener, *Precaution*, in: Daniel Bodansky/Jutta Brunnée/Ellen Hey (eds.), Oxford Handbook on International Environmental Law (2007), 597, 599.\n³⁸ See *Thilo Marauhn*, *Customary Rules of International Environmental Law: Can they Provide Guidance for Developing a Peacetime Regime for Cyberspace?*, in: *Ziolkowski* (ed.) (note 1), 465, 474–476, taking a critical stance on the precautionary principle’s prospects for application in cyber contexts.\n³⁹ ICJ, *Case Concerning Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay* (Argentina v. Uruguay), Judgment of 20 April 2010, ICJ Reports 2010, 14, para. 204.\n⁴⁰ *Arbitration Regarding the Iron Rhine (‘Ijzeren Rijn’) Railway* (Belgium, The Netherlands), Arbitral Award of 24 May 2005, RIAA XXVII, para. 59: “Environmental law and the law on development stand not as alternatives but as mutually reinforcing, integral concepts, which require that where development may cause significant harm to the environment there is a duty to prevent, or at least mitigate, such harm (see paragraph 222). This duty, in the opinion of the Tribunal, has now become a principle of general international law”.\n⁴¹ *The Indus Waters Kishenganga Arbitration* (Pakistan, India), Partial Award of 18 February 2013, paras. 449 et seq., available at: http://www.pca-cpa.org/PK-IN%2020130218%20Partial%20Award%2018ba.pdf?fil_id=2101 (accessed on 11 November 2015): “There is no doubt that States are required under contemporary customary international law to take environmental protection into consideration when planning and developing projects that may cause injury to a bordering State. Since the time of Trail Smelter, a series of international conventions, declarations and judicial and arbitral decisions have addressed the need to manage natural resources in a sustainable manner. In particular, the International Court of Justice expounded upon the principle of ‘sustainable development’ in *Gabcikovo-Nagymaros*, referring to the ‘need to reconcile economic development with protection of the environment.’ Applied to large-scale construction projects, the principle of sustainable development translates, as the International Court of Justice recently put it in *Pulp Mills*, into ‘a requirement under general international law to undertake an environmental impact assessment where there is a risk that the proposed industrial activity may have a significant adverse impact in a transboundary context, in particular, on a shared resource’” (footnotes omitted).\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\nCould one transfer the concept into the cyber world in form of a ‘cyber impact assessment’ requirement?⁴² There are strong arguments against such a transposition. A starting point is that the environmental impact assessment relates to large industrial projects, which are considered to go along with specific risks for the environment. The possible sources of cyber security incidents cannot be narrowed down according to the scale of the activity. Each and every single computer, notebook, tablet, or smartphone could be the source of a cyber security incident. Hence, preventive cyber impact assessment would practically have to cover all activities in the internet. This would be incompatible with requirements of freedom of expression and communication and thus certainly go beyond what could be seen as part of general international law.\n## D. Summary Regarding Prevention\nIn sum, the preventive obligations of States in the absence of concrete cyber security incidents remain rather limited. It is impossible to postulate a general obligation to preventively monitor cyber activities which are linked to the territory of a given State. Therefore, preventive obligations are basically limited to a prohibition to actively engage in malicious cyber activity and to respect due diligence standards regarding computers and systems which are under the control of the State.\n## IV. Procedural Obligations of Cooperation and Information (During and After a Cyber Security Incident)\nDoes that situation change during or after a cyber security incident?\n## A. Good Neighbourliness as a General Source\nThis article has already referred to the principle of good neighbourliness as a general source of cooperation and information. Indeed, Article 74 UN Charter codi\n⁴² On the transferability of international environmental law rules to cyberspace activities see generally Marauhn (note 38), 481–482.\nOBLIGATIONS OF STATES 79\nfies the principle of good neighbourliness regarding all matters of social, economic, and commercial matters. Based on the ICJ’s decision in the *Haya de la Torre* case,⁴³ the legal character of the principle of good neighbourliness is sometimes questioned.⁴⁴ The better view, however, rests its analysis on the frequent reference to the principle in many international treaties and concludes on a ‘hard-law content’ of the principle.⁴⁵ Irrespective of its hard law content, two problems remain when the concept of good neighbourliness is to be applied in the context of cyber security. The first relates to geographic proximity and the second to concrete obligations to be derived from the concept.\nUsually a certain geographic proximity of the States is required when the principle of good neighbourliness is invoked. It should be noted, however, that the United Nations General Assembly, already in 1991 and outside the context of the world wide web, extended the notion of good neighbourliness to all States of the international community “whether or not they are contiguous”.⁴⁶ Even if this approach is considered too far-reaching in the general context of all inter-State relations, a good point for universal neighbourliness may be made as far as relations through the internet are concerned. Effects of cyber activities are not limited to adjacent States but can be produced anywhere. Therefore, looked at from the perspective of its purpose, *i.e.* the obligations to duly take into account possible adverse effects on a neighbouring country, transferring the principle of good neighbourliness to the world wide web leads to its application in all inter-State relations, irrespective of the geographical location of the States concerned.\nAs far as concrete obligations under the principle of good neighbourliness are concerned, it is again international environmental law which provides for the best comparison. The most broadly accepted obligation concerns an obligation of information in case of emergency. Apart from that, there exist also general obligations of information, consultation, and notification in the absence of emergency situations.\n⁴³ ICJ, *Haya de la Torre* (Colombia *v.* Peru), Judgment of 13 June 1951, ICJ Reports 1951, 71.\n⁴⁴ See e.g. *Leland M.

Emergency Information\nThere is a clear customary duty to inform in cases of emergency. Evidence of this duty is – again – the Corfu Channel case where the ICJ considered Albania under an obligation to warn the British warship of the mines, similar obligations of warning are contained in a number of treaties relating to the environment.⁴⁷ One may also point to duties of information concerning infections “in the real world”. Article 6 World Health Organization (WHO) International Health Regulations⁴⁸ requires States to\nnotify WHO, by the most efficient means of communication available, by way of the National IHR [International Health Regulations] Focal Point, and within 24 hours of assessment of public health information, of all events which may constitute a public health emergency of international concern within its territory [...] as well as any health measure implemented in response to those events.\nThus, in order to effectively combat their negative effects, virtual and real viruses may be treated alike.\nGiven the rapid connections via the internet, this information duty in cases of emergency may seem of limited value. On the other hand, one of the last epidemic attacks, the so-called conficker worm which primarily attacked Microsoft Windows operating systems, lasted over a period from 2008 to 2010, infecting among other institutions the German Bundeswehr, the French Navy, and the Greater Manchester Police.⁴⁹ During such a prolonged period, warning not only by the public concerned but also by States may help limiting the consequences.\n## C. Information, Consultation, and Notification Beyond Emergency Situations\nObligations from the principle of good neighbourliness which relate to activities involving a risk of harm are not limited to the ex ante situation, i.e. before the activity\n⁴⁷ For detailed references see *Birnie/Boyle/Redgwell* (note 20), 182 et seq.\n⁴⁸ Cf. Arts. 6 and 7 WHO International Health Regulations (2nd ed. 2005), WHA Doc. WHA 58.3, available at: http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2008/9789241580410_eng.pdf (accessed on 8 June 2015).

This is explicitly spelled out in the ILC Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm.⁵⁰ Article 12 Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm contains a continuous obligation to exchange information.⁵¹ It would seem strange indeed if the obligations concerning information and consultation concerning environmental protection were to end once the project has started. Seen from this perspective, the continued duty to consult and inform once a project has started is basically a prolongation of the precautionary approach which creates obligations of prevention.\nAgainst this background one might be tempted to assume that – when transposed to the issue of cyber security incidents – a continued duty to consult and to inform encounters the same problems which have been highlighted concerning preventive action. However, there is an important factual difference which leads to a different analysis: At the preventive stage, *i.e.* prior to a concrete cyber security incident, it is not possible to limit the obligations to specific activities which may be considered particularly dangerous. By contrast, during or after a cyber security incident it is not unlikely that the State or States where the incident occurred or caused harmful consequences are able to narrow down possible sources and to give information on them. Under such circumstances the duty to provide information and to consult acquires a new and sufficiently specific content. Instead of being related to potentially all activities in the world wide web emanating from a specific country, the duty relates to activities which have proved harmful and thus present characteristics which allow them to be distinguished from other harmless activities. Under such circumstances it seems appropriate to assume a duty of cooperation on the part of the State where the activity allegedly emanated from and to oblige this State to share any information on the matter which is available to its authorities. In other words: While under the principle of good neighbourliness in the real world the size of a certain activity and the risks attached to it trigger general obligations of cooperation, in the cyber world it is the occurrence of a specific cyber security incident which triggers specific obligations of cooperation.\n⁵⁰ See *supra*, note 34.\n⁵¹ “While the activity is being carried out, the States concerned shall exchange in a timely manner all available information concerning that activity relevant to preventing significant transboundary harm or at any event minimizing the risk thereof. Such an exchange of information shall continue until such time as the States concerned consider it appropriate even after the activity is terminated”.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58 · 2015\nIn this context the question arises whether a certain standard of probability must be shown by the requesting State. The standard is not easy to circumscribe. It is certainly not enough if the source of the malicious activity is merely asserted. On the other hand, demanding full proof would most probably be a standard which is difficult to meet. While it is true that the ICJ in the *Oil Platforms* case demanded full proof by the United States (US) that the missile attack against their vessels constituted an armed attack by Iran on the US, which claimed to have reacted in self-defence,⁵² there is a decisive difference in the situation addressed here: The *Oil Platforms* case was about the justification of an otherwise unlawful use of force against another State. In the current context obligations of investigation and information are at issue. In other words: We are not talking about the legality of cross-border activity by one State against another, but about obligations of a State arising out of a specific situation over which it has at least territorial control. On the basis of the *Corfu Channel* case the standard of proof is lower:\nBy reason of this exclusive control, the other State, the victim of a breach of international law, is often unable to furnish direct proof of facts giving rise to responsibility. Such a State should be allowed a more liberal recourse to inferences of fact and circumstantial evidence. This indirect evidence is admitted in all systems of law, and its use is recognized by international decisions. It must be regarded as of special weight when it is based on a series of facts linked together and leading logically to a single conclusion.⁵³\n## D. Cooperation in Investigation and Prosecution\nAnother issue concerns obligations of investigation and prosecution. In order to be clear on the previous point of information and cooperation: The obligation to share information can only relate to information which is already available to the authorities. A certainly more far-reaching obligation would concern investigation and collection of information which is *not yet available*. It is to this point that I now want to turn.\n⁵² ICJ, *Case Concerning Oil Platforms* (Islamic Republic of Iran v. United States of America), Judgment of 6 November 2003, ICJ Reports 2003, 161, paras. 57 et seq.\n⁵³ See *id.*, *Corfu Channel* (note 15), 18.\nOBLIGATIONS OF STATES 83\n## 1. The General Framework for International Criminal Cooperation\nUnder the general framework for international criminal cooperation there are only very limited generally applicable rules. Although the field is moving fast towards closer cooperation,⁵⁴ in the absence of specific treaty provisions mutual assistance in international criminal law is still dominated by traditional views on sovereignty which give the requested State broad discretion in whether at all, and if so under which conditions, it will meet a request for assistance.\nThe main tools which exist within the framework of international criminal cooperation concern requests for extradition and mutual assistance in other matters of criminal investigation, such as witnesses, evidence, etc. Regarding both institutions there are no general, but only specific obligations concerning either certain crimes (i.e. the application of the *aut dedere aut iudicare* principle to acts of terrorism) or the respective obligations are contained in specific treaties on mutual cooperation in criminal matters.\n## 2. Obligations Contained in the Budapest Convention\nThe most elaborate treaty relating to international criminal cooperation concerning crimes related to cyberspace is, again, the Budapest Convention. Apart from defining cyber crime offences, the Convention requires its parties to enact certain investigative procedures for the inquiry into cyber crimes: expedited preservation of stored computer data (Article 16 Budapest Convention), preservation and disclosure of traffic data (Article 17 Budapest Convention), search and seizure of stored computer data (Article 19 Budapest Convention), real-time collection of traffic data (Article 20 Budapest Convention), and, finally, the interception of content data (Article 21 Budapest Convention).\nIn its third part the Convention deals with international cooperation in the areas of extradition, mutual assistance, and establishment of permanent points of contact (Articles 23–35 Budapest Convention). These provisions explicitly take up obliga-\n⁵⁴ *Tim René Salomon*, Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters, MPEPIL, January 2013, paras. 36 *et seq.*, available via: http://www.mpepil.com (accessed on 8 June 2015).\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\ntions which are contained in general treaties on extradition or mutual assistance and extend existing general obligations to cyber crimes as defined under the Budapest Convention (Article 24 (2) Budapest Convention and, with certain limits, Article 25 (4) Budapest Convention concerning mutual assistance).\nAccording to the working definition of cyber security incidents given above, every cyber security incident automatically constitutes a cyber crime under the Convention. Hence the procedural obligations of the Convention apply as far as States parties of the Budapest Convention are concerned. Given the fact that the focus of this analysis rests on general international law, the obligations under the Budapest Convention will, however, not be looked into in more detail.\n## 3. Transposing Obligations of Investigation Developed in International Human Rights Adjudication\nAnother area of inspiration for obligations to investigate may be found in the jurisprudence of international human rights bodies relating to positive obligations of States in case of human rights violations. There is a clear and – it seems – widely accepted obligation to investigate in two groups of cases. The first has already been dealt with in the context of a reversal of the burden of proof, namely situations of complete control by the State (i.e. prisons and other institutions for detaining persons). On the basis of this jurisprudence it may be argued that an obligation to investigate arises where malicious cyber activity can be traced back to a computer or computer system controlled by another State. At first sight one might object that the situations of an individual human rights claim on the one side and inter-State obligations on the other are not compatible. There is, however, a common denominator which is the exclusive control of the State. In that regard, the two situations do not differ decisively. Hence, obligations of investigation may be assumed concerning computers and computer systems under the control of the government.\n## 4. Transborder Access to Data\nThe issue of transborder access to data has gained a lot of public attention in recent days. The Budapest Convention left the issue deliberately open. Article 32 Budapest\nOBLIGATIONS OF STATES\nConvention only regulates the easy cases of data which is publicly available (lit. a) and consent by the person who has the lawful authority to disclose the data (lit. b). One might be tempted to conclude that the express regulation of only these two instances *e contrario* precludes any other transborder access to data. However, the explanatory report excludes this argument by referring to Article 39 Budapest Convention according to which other obligations are neither created nor precluded.⁵⁵\nThe issue of transborder access to data is currently being discussed in the context of a possible Additional Protocol to the Budapest Convention. If my reading of the papers which are publicly available⁵⁶ is correct, there are a number of different proposals on the table. Discussing them would probably require a paper on its own.\nFor that reason I do not want to go into details of transborder access to data. I will limit my comments on this issue to one single point: If the analysis above is correct that under certain circumstances obligations of information and even of investigation may arise out of specific cyber security incidents, the argument may be made that transborder access to data may be justified as a countermeasure if a State does not meet its obligations of investigation (and the other conditions for lawful countermeasures are met).\n## V. Overall Assessment\nTo conclude, the legal obligations of States before, during, and after a cyber security incident can be summarised in two final points:\n1. All States are cyber neighbours. Therefore, in general international law the principle of good neighbourliness is the most promising candidate for developing obligations of cooperation and assistance in dealing with malicious cyber activities. The most important challenge consists in the fact that it is impossible to distin\n⁵⁵ Council of Europe, Explanatory Report to the Convention on Cybercrime, para. 293, available at: https://rm.coe.int/CoERMPublicCommonSearchServices/DisplayDCTMContent?documentId=09000016800ce5b (accessed on 6 November 2015).

On the basis of this assumption, the author inquires into possible principles and rules established in general international law which could be relied on in order to address cyber security incidents, i.e. inter-State conflicts relating to cyberspace which remain below the threshold of the notions of use of force or armed conflict.\nRelying mainly on principles established in international environmental law, it is argued that the principle of good neighbourliness is the most promising candidate for developing obligations of cooperation and assistance in dealing with malicious cyber activities. However, one crucial difference between hazardous activities relating to the environment and threats in cyberspace is spelled out: In contrast to activities with potential dangers for the environment, with regard to the internet it is impossible to distinguish 'hazardous' activities from non-hazardous activities. For this reason it is impossible to establish thresholds or activities in cyberspace which could serve as triggers for preventive obligations. As a consequence, the focus must be laid on obligations of cooperation and assistance during and after a cyber security incident, rather than at the preventive stage.\nKEYWORDS: Cyber Security, Good Neighbourliness, Corfu Channel Case, Burden of Proof, Prevention, Obligations of Cooperation\n## I. Introduction\nThe internet presents many challenges to international law. Its virtual character is considered to put into question the principle of territoriality which in many areas is fundamental to international law as it currently stands. The rapidity of cyber activity requires swift and often coordinated if not collective action by more than one State.\n* Professor for Public and Public International Law, Institute for International Law, Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Munich.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58 · 2015\nFinally, private actors play an important role. This means, on the one side, that issues of State responsibility for private activities have to be addressed, and on the other, that human rights issues must be taken into account. All of this does not fit easily into the inter-State paradigm of mutual obligations between States. The following considerations thus necessarily are of a preliminary, explorative character.\n## II. General Assumptions\n## A. Concerning the Role of States\nA first general assumption relates to the role of States in regulating the internet. In contrast to some positions in literature, in the following the internet is not viewed as a legal space which is distinct from the territory of States and thus subject to its own, independent legal regime. The internet certainly has an important transnational dimension, but that does not mean that it is intrinsically transnational and cannot be made subject to regulations from individual States. Rather, the following considerations are based on a territorial approach according to which ‘the Internet’ is viewed as being – at least in most parts – covered by the authority of the State on whose territory a specific activity in question takes place, i.e. where a person physically conducts his or her malicious activity or where a server or computer on which the activity takes place is located.\nSpecific problems may arise in the context of data which move frequently between different servers and different locations. Given the frequency and rapidity with which the location of data may be changed, the situation of such data has been described as a “loss of location”. However, these specific problems of ‘data in the cloud(s)’ may\n Eneken Tikk, Ten Rules for Cyber Security, Survival: Global Politics and Strategy 53 (2011), 119, 121; Johann-Christoph Woltag, Computer Network Operations Below the Level of Armed Force, European Society of International Law (ESIL) Conference Paper No. 1/2011, 12, available via: http://www.esil-sedi.eu/node/697 (accessed on 31 October 2015); Benedikt Pirker, Territorial Integrity and the Challenges of Cyberspace, in: Katharina Ziolkowski (ed.), Peacetime Regime for State Activities in Cyberspace (2013), 189, 193 et seq. For a similar approach see Art. 22 (1)(a)–(c) Convention on Cybercrime, 23 November 2001, ETS No. 185 (Budapest Convention); specific problems of activities in internationalised territories such as the high seas are left aside, given their presumably small practical relevance.\n Council of Europe, Economic Crime Division, Cloud Computing and Cybercrime Investigations: Territoriality vs. the Power of Disposal?, Discussion Paper, 31 August 2010, available at: rm.coe.int/\nOBLIGATIONS OF STATES 69\nrequire specific methods of inquiry and access, but they do not change the fundamental principle of territoriality.\n## B. Concerning the Term ‘Cyber Security Incident’\nThe term ‘cyber security incident’ is vague. It competes with other notions such as ‘cyber warfare’, ‘cyber terrorism’, ‘cyber conflict’, ‘cyber threat’, ‘cyber crime’, or ‘cyber attack’. Some of these terms go along with certain strategies to ensure cyber security: ‘Cyber crime’ suggests a criminal law approach, ‘cyber warfare’ obviously alludes to use of force and international humanitarian law, etc.\n‘Cyber security incident’ may cover incidents as different as the distributed denial of service attack (DDoS) on the Estonian public computer system in 2007, the Stuxnet worm, which was apparently specifically designed for halting the Iranian nuclear programme, the hacking of computer systems of private companies for the purpose of industrial espionage and other cases of internet torts, hacktivist actions for the promotion of political ideas, etc. One could even include the military dimension under the label of ‘cyber security incident’. However, given that most malicious cyber activity does not reach the level of armed force, only incidents remaining below\nCoERM Public Common Search Services / Display DCTM Content? document Id=09000016802fa3df (accessed on 31 October 2015); see also Cybercrime Convention Committee (T-CY), (Draft) Elements of an Additional Protocol to the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime regarding transborder access to data, 9 April 2013, T-CY (2013)14, available at: https://www.coe.int/t/dghl/cooperation/economic crime/Source/Cybercrime/TCY/TCY%202013/T-CY%282013%2914transb_elements_protocol_V2.pdf (accessed on 11 November 2015).\n See, for an attempt to clarify the relationship of several competing notions, Oona A.

In order to further clarify the notion of ‘cyber security incident’, it is helpful to look at the Convention on Cybercrime (Budapest Convention).\n## C. The CoE Convention on Cybercrime (Budapest Convention)\nA few words concerning the Budapest Convention are in place by way of introduction: The Convention is the most comprehensive binding international document relating to cyber security. Currently the Budapest Convention has 47 parties, among them several States who are not members of the Council of Europe (USA, Japan, Australia, and the Dominican Republic). There are further non-European signatories which have not yet ratified the Convention (Canada and South Africa). The Convention follows a criminal law approach and seeks to harmonise national laws by defining certain computer-related offences and setting minimum standards for the methods of their investigation and concerning the cooperation between States.\nThe definition covers offences against the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of computer-related data and systems (Articles 2–6 Budapest Convention), computer-related offences (forgery and fraud, Articles 7 and 8 Budapest Convention), content-related offences (child pornography, Article 9 Budapest Convention), and finally offences relating to infringements of copyright and related rights (Article 10 Budapest Convention).\n Charter of the United Nations, 26 June 1945, UNCIO 15, 335 (UN Charter).\n See supra, note 1. For a recent account of the Convention see Sophie Kwasny, Lutte contre la cybercriminalité et respect des droits de l'homme: Les instruments du Conseil de l'Europe, in: Société Française Pour le Droit International (ed.), Internet et le droit international: Colloque de Rouen (2014), 339.\n See e.g. Paul Rosenzweig, International Law and Private Actor Active Cyber Defensive Measures, Stanford Journal of International Law 50 (2014), 103, 108; Hathaway et al. (note 3), 862.\n For an analysis see Michael A. Vatis, The Council of Europe Convention on Cyber Crime, in: National Research Council (ed.), Proceedings of a Workshop on Deterring Cyber-Attacks: Informing Strategies and Developing Options for U.S. Policy (2010), 207; Robert Uerpmann-Wittzack, Internet-völkerrecht, Archiv des Völkerrechts 47 (2009), 261, 269–270.\nOBLIGATIONS OF STATES 71\nDue to its criminal law approach, the Budapest Convention includes issues which are not related to inter-State security or to obligations incumbent upon States to ensure that their territories are not used for purposes which are harmful to other States. A more limited approach is therefore warranted for the purposes of this contribution. Accordingly, I propose to limit the notion of ‘cyber security incident’ to those crimes which relate to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of computer data and systems. A cyber security incident thus occurs whenever computers or computer systems are illegally accessed or destroyed or when data are illegally intercepted, deleted, or altered.\n## III. General Obligations of Prevention\nThe first phase of possible obligations relates to the situation prior to a cyber security incident. In this phase obligations of prevention are of interest. These aspects will be dealt with first (III.). In a second step obligations of cooperation and information will be dealt with (IV.). These obligations are mostly relevant during or after a cyber security incident has occurred.\n## A. Principle of Non-Intervention\nThe most fundamental principle applicable is the principle of non-intervention. According to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) it is “part and parcel of customary international law”. When a State uses the internet in order to destabilise another country, this constitutes a violation of the principle of non-intervention. Similarly, cyber-based activities of organs of one State on computers situated in another country or relating to parts of the web situated in another country would infringe upon the latter country’s sovereignty.\nIn this area, issues such as attribution, standards of proof, etc. are more important than the substantive law, which is quite clear. In that regard, it is necessary to distinguish between computers and computer systems belonging to the government and\n International Court of Justice (ICJ), *Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua* (Nicaragua v. United States of America), Merits, Judgment of 27 June 1986, ICJ Reports 1986, para. 202.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58 · 2015\ncomputers and computer systems owned and operated by private individuals or companies. Computers belonging to the government may be presumed to be controlled by the government. Ideas for distributing responsibility under such circumstances may be borrowed from the jurisprudence and practice of human rights bodies regarding persons who are in complete control of State agents.\nThe European Court of Human Rights, for instance, argues as follows:\nWhere the events in issue lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of persons within their control in custody, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries and death occurring during such detention. Indeed, the burden of proof may be regarded as resting on the authorities to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation.^[14]^\nThe factor of exclusive control was also taken into consideration by the ICJ in developing its standard of proof in the Corfu Channel case:\n[...] the fact of this exclusive territorial control exercised by a State within its frontiers has a bearing upon the methods of proof available to establish the knowledge of that State as to such events. By reason of this exclusive control, the other State, the victim of a breach of international law, is often unable to furnish direct proof of facts giving rise to responsibility. Such a State should be allowed a more liberal recourse to inferences of fact and circumstantial evidence. This indirect evidence is admitted in all systems of law, and its use is recognized by international decisions. It must be regarded as of special weight when it is based on a series of facts linked together and leading logically to a single conclusion.^[15]^\nActivities on computers owned by the government are “within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities.” Hence, the following assumption may be made: Where a malicious cyber activity creating a cyber security incident can be traced back to a government computer or computer system, the activity may be attributed to the government, unless it provides a satisfactory and convincing explanation that the system was externally used (i.e. has been hacked by someone else).^[16]^\n^[14] European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR), Salman v.

Hence, it is necessary to establish that the activity in question was executed “on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct.” Usually it will be impossible to meet this standard. It is therefore necessary to ask whether there are further obligations of control or prevention which include activities of private actors.\n## B. No-Harm Principle\nIn the *Corfu Channel* case the ICJ assumed a general duty to prevent harm. The Court ruled on a general principle to prevent harm as one of the bases for an Albanian duty to warn the British government: “[...] every State’s obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States.”\nThe general principle has been developed in more detail in the area of international environmental law where good neighbourliness and a duty to prevent harm are considered to be part of customary law. The main sources for this principle are the famous *Trail Smelter* arbitration and Principle 21 Stockholm Declaration/Principle 2 Rio Declaration.\n---\n International Law Commission (ILC), Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, GAOR, 56th Sess., Suppl. 10, 43 et seq.\n Cf. also Terry D.

(note 7).\n The Stockholm Declaration’s wording: “States have, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and the principles of international law, the sovereign right to exploit their own resources pursuant to their own environmental policies, and the responsibility to ensure that activities within their jurisdiction or control do not cause damage to the environment of other States or of areas beyond the limits of national jurisdiction”, Stockholm Declaration of the United Nations Conference\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58 · 2015\nThese principles allow for the inclusion of harm caused by private actors. In the *Corfu Channel* case mere knowledge by the Albanian authorities of the danger was sufficient, and in the *Trail Smelter* case the pollution emanated from a private plant. Thus, the principles of good neighbourliness and the duty to prevent harm extend the responsibility of States for private action beyond the strict criteria of Article 8 Articles on State Responsibility. To put the issue more generally: Responsibility of States for private action is not only caused by criteria of attribution, i.e. within the law of State responsibility, but also by the character of the primary obligations of States. Obligations of control and surveillance entail an indirect responsibility for private action if they are not respected. This reflects that there is an interaction in the law of State responsibility between the issue of attribution on the one side and the scope of the obligation of the State on the other. In terms of the practical outcome, obligations of surveillance and control may thus constitute a substitute for the attribution of private action to a State.\nThe consequences which flow from the overall responsibility of States for harmful activities on their territory are, however, mitigated to some extent by additional criteria.\nFirst, the *Corfu Channel* formula requires “knowledge” on part of the State concerned. While the ICJ could operate with certain assumptions regarding the overall control of the territorial waters, such an overall control certainly cannot be assumed with respect to any cyber activity on the territory of a given State. Hence, the requirement of “knowledge” of the harmful activity will only be met in rare cases.\non the Human Environment, UN Doc.

It does not seem to be excluded, however, that these criteria are met in the context of cyber security incidents. For example, it has been argued that the DDoS attack on Estonia in 2007 constituted a case of “serious consequence”. Irrespective of that it is today mostly recognised that international environmental law has developed beyond the Trail Smelter requirements. Thus, the no-harm rule as it currently stands in customary international law only requires a certain *de minimis* threshold to be fulfilled and the precautionary principle may be considered to have alleviated the strict Trail Smelter standard of proof.\nFinally, the Trail Smelter principle is further mitigated by the requirement of due diligence. Today “there is a clear consensus that although the no-harm principle does not say so explicitly, a State can only breach the principle if it fails to act with due diligence.” According to the ILC in its Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities (Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm) both the magnitude and the probability of harm are to be taken\n For further elaboration on this see Russell A.

Further minimum requirements are foreseeability for the State concerned and respect of the best scientific knowledge.\nIf these due diligence requirements are taken into consideration, it must be questioned whether one can expect a significant contribution of the no-harm rule to the prevention of cyber security incidents. While it may be worthwhile to explore the technological possibilities of prevention to some extent, it cannot be overlooked that a preventive surveillance of all cyber activities neither seems to be a technical possibility nor would it meet human rights standards of freedom of expression and communication. Hence, preventive action by States is both factually and legally considerably limited.\n## C. Precautionary Principle\nA similar scepticism relates to the precautionary principle, which would be the most obvious candidate for imposing preventive action. Indeed, the precautionary\n See the commentary to Art. 3 Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm, para. 11: “The standard of due diligence against which the conduct of the State of origin should be examined is that which is generally considered to be appropriate and proportional to the degree of risk of transboundary harm in the particular instance. For example, activities which may be considered ultrahazardous require a much higher standard of care in designing policies and a much higher degree of vigour on the part of the State to enforce them. Issues such as the size of the operation; its location, special climate conditions, materials used in the activity, and whether the conclusions drawn from the application of these factors in a specific case are reasonable, are among the factors to be considered in determining the due diligence requirement in each instance. What would be considered a reasonable standard of care or due diligence may change with time; what might be considered an appropriate and reasonable procedure, standard or rule at one point in time may not be considered as such at some point in the future. Hence, due diligence in ensuring safety requires a State to keep abreast of technological changes and scientific developments” (II.C, Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities, with Commentaries (2001), Report on the Work of its 53rd Session, UN Doc. A/56/10 (2001), 377); see also the definition of “risk of causing significant transboundary harm” in Art. 2 Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm: “The definition refers to two types of activities under these articles. One is where there is a low probability of causing disastrous harm. This is normally the characteristic of ultrahazardous activities. The other one is where there is a high probability of causing significant harm. This includes activities which have a high probability of causing harm which, while not disastrous, is still significant. But it would exclude activities where there is a very low probability of causing significant transboundary harm.” (ibid., commentary para. 3).\n Beyerlin/Marauhn (note 32), 43.\n For a discussion of the due diligence standard’s applicability in cyberspace regulation (with reference to the ‘duty of prevention’) see also Pirker (note 1), 206–209.\nOBLIGATIONS OF STATES 77\nprinciple has assumed a prominent place in modern international law. Although its legal basis in customary law is still being questioned, there are clear indications to the contrary, notably regarding environmental impact assessments. The requirement to undertake an environmental impact assessment has been considered to be rooted in customary international law by several international decisions. The most prominent among them is the *Pulp Mills* case of the ICJ where the Court held that\n[...] it may now be considered a requirement under general international law to undertake an environmental impact assessment where there is a risk that the proposed industrial activity may have a significant adverse impact in a transboundary context [...].\nSimilar approaches were taken by arbitral tribunals in the *Iron Rhine Arbitration* and the *Indus Waters Project*. It may therefore be assumed that at least in form of an environmental impact assessment the precautionary principle has entered general international law.\n Jonathan B. Wiener, *Precaution*, in: Daniel Bodansky/Jutta Brunnée/Ellen Hey (eds.), Oxford Handbook on International Environmental Law (2007), 597, 599.\n See *Thilo Marauhn*, *Customary Rules of International Environmental Law: Can they Provide Guidance for Developing a Peacetime Regime for Cyberspace?*, in: *Ziolkowski* (ed.) (note 1), 465, 474–476, taking a critical stance on the precautionary principle’s prospects for application in cyber contexts.\n ICJ, *Case Concerning Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay* (Argentina v. Uruguay), Judgment of 20 April 2010, ICJ Reports 2010, 14, para. 204.\n *Arbitration Regarding the Iron Rhine (‘Ijzeren Rijn’) Railway* (Belgium, The Netherlands), Arbitral Award of 24 May 2005, RIAA XXVII, para. 59: “Environmental law and the law on development stand not as alternatives but as mutually reinforcing, integral concepts, which require that where development may cause significant harm to the environment there is a duty to prevent, or at least mitigate, such harm (see paragraph 222). This duty, in the opinion of the Tribunal, has now become a principle of general international law”.\n *The Indus Waters Kishenganga Arbitration* (Pakistan, India), Partial Award of 18 February 2013, paras. 449 et seq., available at: http://www.pca-cpa.org/PK-IN%2020130218%20Partial%20Award%2018ba.pdf?fil_id=2101 (accessed on 11 November 2015): “There is no doubt that States are required under contemporary customary international law to take environmental protection into consideration when planning and developing projects that may cause injury to a bordering State. Since the time of Trail Smelter, a series of international conventions, declarations and judicial and arbitral decisions have addressed the need to manage natural resources in a sustainable manner. In particular, the International Court of Justice expounded upon the principle of ‘sustainable development’ in *Gabcikovo-Nagymaros*, referring to the ‘need to reconcile economic development with protection of the environment.’ Applied to large-scale construction projects, the principle of sustainable development translates, as the International Court of Justice recently put it in *Pulp Mills*, into ‘a requirement under general international law to undertake an environmental impact assessment where there is a risk that the proposed industrial activity may have a significant adverse impact in a transboundary context, in particular, on a shared resource’” (footnotes omitted).\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\nCould one transfer the concept into the cyber world in form of a ‘cyber impact assessment’ requirement? There are strong arguments against such a transposition. A starting point is that the environmental impact assessment relates to large industrial projects, which are considered to go along with specific risks for the environment. The possible sources of cyber security incidents cannot be narrowed down according to the scale of the activity. Each and every single computer, notebook, tablet, or smartphone could be the source of a cyber security incident. Hence, preventive cyber impact assessment would practically have to cover all activities in the internet. This would be incompatible with requirements of freedom of expression and communication and thus certainly go beyond what could be seen as part of general international law.\n## D. Summary Regarding Prevention\nIn sum, the preventive obligations of States in the absence of concrete cyber security incidents remain rather limited. It is impossible to postulate a general obligation to preventively monitor cyber activities which are linked to the territory of a given State. Therefore, preventive obligations are basically limited to a prohibition to actively engage in malicious cyber activity and to respect due diligence standards regarding computers and systems which are under the control of the State.\n## IV. Procedural Obligations of Cooperation and Information (During and After a Cyber Security Incident)\nDoes that situation change during or after a cyber security incident?\n## A. Good Neighbourliness as a General Source\nThis article has already referred to the principle of good neighbourliness as a general source of cooperation and information. Indeed, Article 74 UN Charter codi\n On the transferability of international environmental law rules to cyberspace activities see generally Marauhn (note 38), 481–482.\nOBLIGATIONS OF STATES 79\nfies the principle of good neighbourliness regarding all matters of social, economic, and commercial matters. Based on the ICJ’s decision in the *Haya de la Torre* case, the legal character of the principle of good neighbourliness is sometimes questioned. The better view, however, rests its analysis on the frequent reference to the principle in many international treaties and concludes on a ‘hard-law content’ of the principle. Irrespective of its hard law content, two problems remain when the concept of good neighbourliness is to be applied in the context of cyber security. The first relates to geographic proximity and the second to concrete obligations to be derived from the concept.\nUsually a certain geographic proximity of the States is required when the principle of good neighbourliness is invoked. It should be noted, however, that the United Nations General Assembly, already in 1991 and outside the context of the world wide web, extended the notion of good neighbourliness to all States of the international community “whether or not they are contiguous”. Even if this approach is considered too far-reaching in the general context of all inter-State relations, a good point for universal neighbourliness may be made as far as relations through the internet are concerned. Effects of cyber activities are not limited to adjacent States but can be produced anywhere. Therefore, looked at from the perspective of its purpose, *i.e.* the obligations to duly take into account possible adverse effects on a neighbouring country, transferring the principle of good neighbourliness to the world wide web leads to its application in all inter-State relations, irrespective of the geographical location of the States concerned.\nAs far as concrete obligations under the principle of good neighbourliness are concerned, it is again international environmental law which provides for the best comparison. The most broadly accepted obligation concerns an obligation of information in case of emergency. Apart from that, there exist also general obligations of information, consultation, and notification in the absence of emergency situations.\n ICJ, *Haya de la Torre* (Colombia *v.* Peru), Judgment of 13 June 1951, ICJ Reports 1951, 71.\n See e.g. *Leland M. Goodrich/Edvard Hambro/Anne Patricia Simons*, Charter of the United Nations: Commentary and Documents (3rd ed. 1969), 463.\n *Laurence Boisson de Chazournes/Danio Campanelli*, Neighbour States, MPEPIL, December 2006, para. 20, available *via*: http://www.mpepil.com (accessed on 8 June 2015); *Ulrich Fastenrath*, Article 74, in: Bruno Simma *et al.* (eds.), UN Charter Commentary (3rd ed. 2012), 1840, MN 2.\n GA Res. 46/92 of 9 December 1991.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\n## B. Emergency Information\nThere is a clear customary duty to inform in cases of emergency. Evidence of this duty is – again – the Corfu Channel case where the ICJ considered Albania under an obligation to warn the British warship of the mines, similar obligations of warning are contained in a number of treaties relating to the environment. One may also point to duties of information concerning infections “in the real world”. Article 6 World Health Organization (WHO) International Health Regulations requires States to\nnotify WHO, by the most efficient means of communication available, by way of the National IHR [International Health Regulations] Focal Point, and within 24 hours of assessment of public health information, of all events which may constitute a public health emergency of international concern within its territory [...] as well as any health measure implemented in response to those events.\nThus, in order to effectively combat their negative effects, virtual and real viruses may be treated alike.\nGiven the rapid connections via the internet, this information duty in cases of emergency may seem of limited value. On the other hand, one of the last epidemic attacks, the so-called conficker worm which primarily attacked Microsoft Windows operating systems, lasted over a period from 2008 to 2010, infecting among other institutions the German Bundeswehr, the French Navy, and the Greater Manchester Police. During such a prolonged period, warning not only by the public concerned but also by States may help limiting the consequences.\n## C. Information, Consultation, and Notification Beyond Emergency Situations\nObligations from the principle of good neighbourliness which relate to activities involving a risk of harm are not limited to the ex ante situation, i.e. before the activity\n For detailed references see *Birnie/Boyle/Redgwell* (note 20), 182 et seq.\n Cf. Arts. 6 and 7 WHO International Health Regulations (2nd ed. 2005), WHA Doc. WHA 58.3, available at: http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2008/9789241580410_eng.pdf (accessed on 8 June 2015).

Davies*, Is There an International Duty to Protect Persons in the Event of an Epidemic?, Global Health Governance (2010), available via: http://www.ghgj.org (accessed on 8 June 2015).\n For more information on this worm see e.g. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conficker (accessed on 11 November 2015).\nOBLIGATIONS OF STATES 81\nis started. This is explicitly spelled out in the ILC Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm. Article 12 Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm contains a continuous obligation to exchange information. It would seem strange indeed if the obligations concerning information and consultation concerning environmental protection were to end once the project has started. Seen from this perspective, the continued duty to consult and inform once a project has started is basically a prolongation of the precautionary approach which creates obligations of prevention.\nAgainst this background one might be tempted to assume that – when transposed to the issue of cyber security incidents – a continued duty to consult and to inform encounters the same problems which have been highlighted concerning preventive action. However, there is an important factual difference which leads to a different analysis: At the preventive stage, *i.e.* prior to a concrete cyber security incident, it is not possible to limit the obligations to specific activities which may be considered particularly dangerous. By contrast, during or after a cyber security incident it is not unlikely that the State or States where the incident occurred or caused harmful consequences are able to narrow down possible sources and to give information on them. Under such circumstances the duty to provide information and to consult acquires a new and sufficiently specific content. Instead of being related to potentially all activities in the world wide web emanating from a specific country, the duty relates to activities which have proved harmful and thus present characteristics which allow them to be distinguished from other harmless activities. Under such circumstances it seems appropriate to assume a duty of cooperation on the part of the State where the activity allegedly emanated from and to oblige this State to share any information on the matter which is available to its authorities. In other words: While under the principle of good neighbourliness in the real world the size of a certain activity and the risks attached to it trigger general obligations of cooperation, in the cyber world it is the occurrence of a specific cyber security incident which triggers specific obligations of cooperation.\n See *supra*, note 34.\n “While the activity is being carried out, the States concerned shall exchange in a timely manner all available information concerning that activity relevant to preventing significant transboundary harm or at any event minimizing the risk thereof. Such an exchange of information shall continue until such time as the States concerned consider it appropriate even after the activity is terminated”.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58 · 2015\nIn this context the question arises whether a certain standard of probability must be shown by the requesting State. The standard is not easy to circumscribe. It is certainly not enough if the source of the malicious activity is merely asserted. On the other hand, demanding full proof would most probably be a standard which is difficult to meet. While it is true that the ICJ in the *Oil Platforms* case demanded full proof by the United States (US) that the missile attack against their vessels constituted an armed attack by Iran on the US, which claimed to have reacted in self-defence, there is a decisive difference in the situation addressed here: The *Oil Platforms* case was about the justification of an otherwise unlawful use of force against another State. In the current context obligations of investigation and information are at issue. In other words: We are not talking about the legality of cross-border activity by one State against another, but about obligations of a State arising out of a specific situation over which it has at least territorial control. On the basis of the *Corfu Channel* case the standard of proof is lower:\nBy reason of this exclusive control, the other State, the victim of a breach of international law, is often unable to furnish direct proof of facts giving rise to responsibility. Such a State should be allowed a more liberal recourse to inferences of fact and circumstantial evidence. This indirect evidence is admitted in all systems of law, and its use is recognized by international decisions. It must be regarded as of special weight when it is based on a series of facts linked together and leading logically to a single conclusion.\n## D. Cooperation in Investigation and Prosecution\nAnother issue concerns obligations of investigation and prosecution. In order to be clear on the previous point of information and cooperation: The obligation to share information can only relate to information which is already available to the authorities. A certainly more far-reaching obligation would concern investigation and collection of information which is *not yet available*. It is to this point that I now want to turn.\n ICJ, *Case Concerning Oil Platforms* (Islamic Republic of Iran v. United States of America), Judgment of 6 November 2003, ICJ Reports 2003, 161, paras. 57 et seq.\n See *id.*, *Corfu Channel* (note 15), 18.\nOBLIGATIONS OF STATES 83\n## 1. The General Framework for International Criminal Cooperation\nUnder the general framework for international criminal cooperation there are only very limited generally applicable rules. Although the field is moving fast towards closer cooperation, in the absence of specific treaty provisions mutual assistance in international criminal law is still dominated by traditional views on sovereignty which give the requested State broad discretion in whether at all, and if so under which conditions, it will meet a request for assistance.\nThe main tools which exist within the framework of international criminal cooperation concern requests for extradition and mutual assistance in other matters of criminal investigation, such as witnesses, evidence, etc. Regarding both institutions there are no general, but only specific obligations concerning either certain crimes (i.e. the application of the *aut dedere aut iudicare* principle to acts of terrorism) or the respective obligations are contained in specific treaties on mutual cooperation in criminal matters.\n## 2. Obligations Contained in the Budapest Convention\nThe most elaborate treaty relating to international criminal cooperation concerning crimes related to cyberspace is, again, the Budapest Convention. Apart from defining cyber crime offences, the Convention requires its parties to enact certain investigative procedures for the inquiry into cyber crimes: expedited preservation of stored computer data (Article 16 Budapest Convention), preservation and disclosure of traffic data (Article 17 Budapest Convention), search and seizure of stored computer data (Article 19 Budapest Convention), real-time collection of traffic data (Article 20 Budapest Convention), and, finally, the interception of content data (Article 21 Budapest Convention).\nIn its third part the Convention deals with international cooperation in the areas of extradition, mutual assistance, and establishment of permanent points of contact (Articles 23–35 Budapest Convention). These provisions explicitly take up obliga-\n *Tim René Salomon*, Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters, MPEPIL, January 2013, paras. 36 *et seq.*, available via: http://www.mpepil.com (accessed on 8 June 2015).\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\ntions which are contained in general treaties on extradition or mutual assistance and extend existing general obligations to cyber crimes as defined under the Budapest Convention (Article 24 (2) Budapest Convention and, with certain limits, Article 25 (4) Budapest Convention concerning mutual assistance).\nAccording to the working definition of cyber security incidents given above, every cyber security incident automatically constitutes a cyber crime under the Convention. Hence the procedural obligations of the Convention apply as far as States parties of the Budapest Convention are concerned. Given the fact that the focus of this analysis rests on general international law, the obligations under the Budapest Convention will, however, not be looked into in more detail.\n## 3. Transposing Obligations of Investigation Developed in International Human Rights Adjudication\nAnother area of inspiration for obligations to investigate may be found in the jurisprudence of international human rights bodies relating to positive obligations of States in case of human rights violations. There is a clear and – it seems – widely accepted obligation to investigate in two groups of cases. The first has already been dealt with in the context of a reversal of the burden of proof, namely situations of complete control by the State (i.e. prisons and other institutions for detaining persons). On the basis of this jurisprudence it may be argued that an obligation to investigate arises where malicious cyber activity can be traced back to a computer or computer system controlled by another State. At first sight one might object that the situations of an individual human rights claim on the one side and inter-State obligations on the other are not compatible. There is, however, a common denominator which is the exclusive control of the State. In that regard, the two situations do not differ decisively. Hence, obligations of investigation may be assumed concerning computers and computer systems under the control of the government.\n## 4. Transborder Access to Data\nThe issue of transborder access to data has gained a lot of public attention in recent days. The Budapest Convention left the issue deliberately open. Article 32 Budapest\nOBLIGATIONS OF STATES\nConvention only regulates the easy cases of data which is publicly available (lit. a) and consent by the person who has the lawful authority to disclose the data (lit. b). One might be tempted to conclude that the express regulation of only these two instances *e contrario* precludes any other transborder access to data. However, the explanatory report excludes this argument by referring to Article 39 Budapest Convention according to which other obligations are neither created nor precluded.\nThe issue of transborder access to data is currently being discussed in the context of a possible Additional Protocol to the Budapest Convention. If my reading of the papers which are publicly available is correct, there are a number of different proposals on the table. Discussing them would probably require a paper on its own.\nFor that reason I do not want to go into details of transborder access to data. I will limit my comments on this issue to one single point: If the analysis above is correct that under certain circumstances obligations of information and even of investigation may arise out of specific cyber security incidents, the argument may be made that transborder access to data may be justified as a countermeasure if a State does not meet its obligations of investigation (and the other conditions for lawful countermeasures are met).\n## V. Overall Assessment\nTo conclude, the legal obligations of States before, during, and after a cyber security incident can be summarised in two final points:\n1. All States are cyber neighbours. Therefore, in general international law the principle of good neighbourliness is the most promising candidate for developing obligations of cooperation and assistance in dealing with malicious cyber activities. The most important challenge consists in the fact that it is impossible to distin\n Council of Europe, Explanatory Report to the Convention on Cybercrime, para. 293, available at: https://rm.coe.int/CoERMPublicCommonSearchServices/DisplayDCTMContent?documentId=09000016800ce5b (accessed on 6 November 2015).

As a consequence of this specific characteristic of cyber activities the focus must be laid on obligations of cooperation during and after a cyber security incident, rather than at the preventive stage.",

      "## II. General Assumptions ## A. Concerning the Role of States A first general assumption relates to the role of States in regulating the internet. In contrast to some positions in literature, in the following the internet is not viewed as a legal space which is distinct from the territory of States and thus subject to its own, independent legal regime. The internet certainly has an important transnational dimension, but that does not mean that it is intrinsically transnational and cannot be made subject to regulations from individual States. Rather, the following considerations are based on a territorial approach according to which ‘the Internet’ is viewed as being – at least in most parts – covered by the authority of the State on whose territory a specific activity in question takes place, i.e. where a person physically conducts his or her malicious activity or where a server or computer on which the activity takes place is located.¹ Specific problems may arise in the context of data which move frequently between different servers and different locations. Given the frequency and rapidity with which the location of data may be changed, the situation of such data has been described as a “loss of location”.² However, these specific problems of ‘data in the cloud(s)’ may ¹ Eneken Tikk, Ten Rules for Cyber Security, Survival: Global Politics and Strategy 53 (2011), 119, 121; Johann-Christoph Woltag, Computer Network Operations Below the Level of Armed Force, European Society of International Law (ESIL) Conference Paper No. 1/2011, 12, available via: http://www.esil-sedi.eu/node/697 (accessed on 31 October 2015); Benedikt Pirker, Territorial Integrity and the Challenges of Cyberspace, in: Katharina Ziolkowski (ed.), Peacetime Regime for State Activities in Cyberspace (2013), 189, 193 et seq.

What would be considered a reasonable standard of care or due diligence may change with time; what might be considered an appropriate and reasonable procedure, standard or rule at one point in time may not be considered as such at some point in the future. Hence, due diligence in ensuring safety requires a State to keep abreast of technological changes and scientific developments” (II.C, Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities, with Commentaries (2001), Report on the Work of its 53rd Session, UN Doc. A/56/10 (2001), 377); see also the definition of “risk of causing significant transboundary harm” in Art. 2 Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm: “The definition refers to two types of activities under these articles. One is where there is a low probability of causing disastrous harm. This is normally the characteristic of ultrahazardous activities. The other one is where there is a high probability of causing significant harm. This includes activities which have a high probability of causing harm which, while not disastrous, is still significant. But it would exclude activities where there is a very low probability of causing significant transboundary harm.” (ibid., commentary para. 3)."

It is impossible to postulate a general obligation to preventively monitor cyber activities which are linked to the territory of a given State. Therefore, preventive obligations are basically limited to a prohibition to actively engage in malicious cyber activity and to respect due diligence standards regarding computers and systems which are under the control of the State."

      "## 3. Transposing Obligations of Investigation Developed in International Human Rights Adjudication Another area of inspiration for obligations to investigate may be found in the jurisprudence of international human rights bodies relating to positive obligations of States in case of human rights violations. There is a clear and – it seems – widely accepted obligation to investigate in two groups of cases. The first has already been dealt with in the context of a reversal of the burden of proof, namely situations of complete control by the State (i.e. prisons and other institutions for detaining persons). On the basis of this jurisprudence it may be argued that an obligation to investigate arises where malicious cyber activity can be traced back to a computer or computer system controlled by another State. At first sight one might object that the situations of an individual human rights claim on the one side and inter-State obligations on the other are not compatible. There is, however, a common denominator which is the exclusive control of the State. In that regard, the two situations do not differ decisively. Hence, obligations of investigation may be assumed concerning computers and computer systems under the control of the government."

One might be tempted to conclude that the express regulation of only these two instances *e contrario* precludes any other transborder access to data. However, the explanatory report excludes this argument by referring to Article 39 Budapest Convention according to which other obligations are neither created nor precluded.⁵⁵ The issue of transborder access to data is currently being discussed in the context of a possible Additional Protocol to the Budapest Convention.

    "## II. General Assumptions ## A. Concerning the Role of States A first general assumption relates to the role of States in regulating the internet. In contrast to some positions in literature, in the following the internet is not viewed as a legal space which is distinct from the territory of States and thus subject to its own, independent legal regime. The internet certainly has an important transnational dimension, but that does not mean that it is intrinsically transnational and cannot be made subject to regulations from individual States. Rather, the following considerations are based on a territorial approach according to which ‘the Internet’ is viewed as being – at least in most parts – covered by the authority of the State on whose territory a specific activity in question takes place, i.e. where a person physically conducts his or her malicious activity or where a server or computer on which the activity takes place is located.¹ Specific problems may arise in the context of data which move frequently between different servers and different locations. Given the frequency and rapidity with which the location of data may be changed, the situation of such data has been described as a “loss of location”.² However, these specific problems of ‘data in the cloud(s)’ may ¹ Eneken Tikk, Ten Rules for Cyber Security, Survival: Global Politics and Strategy 53 (2011), 119, 121; Johann-Christoph Woltag, Computer Network Operations Below the Level of Armed Force, European Society of International Law (ESIL) Conference Paper No. 1/2011, 12, available via: http://www.esil-sedi.eu/node/697 (accessed on 31 October 2015); Benedikt Pirker, Territorial Integrity and the Challenges of Cyberspace, in: Katharina Ziolkowski (ed.), Peacetime Regime for State Activities in Cyberspace (2013), 189, 193 et seq. For a similar approach see Art. 22 (1)(a)–(c) Convention on Cybercrime, 23 November 2001, ETS No. 185 (Budapest Convention); specific problems of activities in internationalised territories such as the high seas are left aside, given their presumably small practical relevance.": "² Council of Europe, Economic Crime Division, Cloud Computing and Cybercrime Investigations: Territoriality vs. the Power of Disposal?, Discussion Paper, 31 August 2010, available at: rm.coe.int/ OBLIGATIONS OF STATES 69 require specific methods of inquiry and access, but they do not change the fundamental principle of territoriality.",
    "## B. Concerning the Term ‘Cyber Security Incident’ The term ‘cyber security incident’ is vague. It competes with other notions such as ‘cyber warfare’, ‘cyber terrorism’, ‘cyber conflict’, ‘cyber threat’, ‘cyber crime’, or ‘cyber attack’.³ Some of these terms go along with certain strategies to ensure cyber security:⁴ ‘Cyber crime’ suggests a criminal law approach, ‘cyber warfare’ obviously alludes to use of force and international humanitarian law, etc.": "‘Cyber security incident’ may cover incidents as different as the distributed denial of service attack (DDoS) on the Estonian public computer system in 2007,⁵ the Stuxnet worm, which was apparently specifically designed for halting the Iranian nuclear programme,⁶ the hacking of computer systems of private companies for the purpose of industrial espionage and other cases of internet torts,⁷ hacktivist actions for the promotion of political ideas,⁸ etc. One could even include the military dimension under the label of ‘cyber security incident’.

In order to further clarify the notion of ‘cyber security incident’, it is helpful to look at the Convention on Cybercrime (Budapest Convention).¹⁰ ## C. The CoE Convention on Cybercrime (Budapest Convention) A few words concerning the Budapest Convention are in place by way of introduction: The Convention is the most comprehensive binding international document relating to cyber security.¹¹ Currently the Budapest Convention has 47 parties, among them several States who are not members of the Council of Europe (USA, Japan, Australia, and the Dominican Republic). There are further non-European signatories which have not yet ratified the Convention (Canada and South Africa). The Convention follows a criminal law approach and seeks to harmonise national laws by defining certain computer-related offences and setting minimum standards for the methods of their investigation and concerning the cooperation between States.¹² The definition covers offences against the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of computer-related data and systems (Articles 2–6 Budapest Convention), computer-related offences (forgery and fraud, Articles 7 and 8 Budapest Convention), content-related offences (child pornography, Article 9 Budapest Convention), and finally offences relating to infringements of copyright and related rights (Article 10 Budapest Convention).\n⁹ Charter of the United Nations, 26 June 1945, UNCIO 15, 335 (UN Charter).\n¹⁰ See supra, note 1. For a recent account of the Convention see Sophie Kwasny, Lutte contre la cybercriminalité et respect des droits de l'homme: Les instruments du Conseil de l'Europe, in: Société Française Pour le Droit International (ed.), Internet et le droit international: Colloque de Rouen (2014), 339.\n¹¹ See e.g. Paul Rosenzweig, International Law and Private Actor Active Cyber Defensive Measures, Stanford Journal of International Law 50 (2014), 103, 108; Hathaway et al. (note 3), 862.\n¹² For an analysis see Michael A. Vatis, The Council of Europe Convention on Cyber Crime, in: National Research Council (ed.), Proceedings of a Workshop on Deterring Cyber-Attacks: Informing Strategies and Developing Options for U.S. Policy (2010), 207; Robert Uerpmann-Wittzack, Internet-völkerrecht, Archiv des Völkerrechts 47 (2009), 261, 269–270.\nOBLIGATIONS OF STATES 71 Due to its criminal law approach, the Budapest Convention includes issues which are not related to inter-State security or to obligations incumbent upon States to ensure that their territories are not used for purposes which are harmful to other States. A more limited approach is therefore warranted for the purposes of this contribution. Accordingly, I propose to limit the notion of ‘cyber security incident’ to those crimes which relate to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of computer data and systems. A cyber security incident thus occurs whenever computers or computer systems are illegally accessed or destroyed or when data are illegally intercepted, deleted, or altered.",
    "## III. General Obligations of Prevention The first phase of possible obligations relates to the situation prior to a cyber security incident. In this phase obligations of prevention are of interest. These aspects will be dealt with first (III.). In a second step obligations of cooperation and information will be dealt with (IV.). These obligations are mostly relevant during or after a cyber security incident has occurred.": "",
    "## A. Principle of Non-Intervention The most fundamental principle applicable is the principle of non-intervention. According to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) it is “part and parcel of customary international law”.¹³ When a State uses the internet in order to destabilise another country, this constitutes a violation of the principle of non-intervention. Similarly, cyber-based activities of organs of one State on computers situated in another country or relating to parts of the web situated in another country would infringe upon the latter country’s sovereignty.": "In this area, issues such as attribution, standards of proof, etc. are more important than the substantive law, which is quite clear. In that regard, it is necessary to distinguish between computers and computer systems belonging to the government and ¹³ International Court of Justice (ICJ), *Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua* (Nicaragua v. United States of America), Merits, Judgment of 27 June 1986, ICJ Reports 1986, para. 202.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58 · 2015 computers and computer systems owned and operated by private individuals or companies. Computers belonging to the government may be presumed to be controlled by the government. Ideas for distributing responsibility under such circumstances may be borrowed from the jurisprudence and practice of human rights bodies regarding persons who are in complete control of State agents.\nThe European Court of Human Rights, for instance, argues as follows: Where the events in issue lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of persons within their control in custody, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries and death occurring during such detention. Indeed, the burden of proof may be regarded as resting on the authorities to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation.^[14]^ The factor of exclusive control was also taken into consideration by the ICJ in developing its standard of proof in the Corfu Channel case: [...] the fact of this exclusive territorial control exercised by a State within its frontiers has a bearing upon the methods of proof available to establish the knowledge of that State as to such events. By reason of this exclusive control, the other State, the victim of a breach of international law, is often unable to furnish direct proof of facts giving rise to responsibility. Such a State should be allowed a more liberal recourse to inferences of fact and circumstantial evidence. This indirect evidence is admitted in all systems of law, and its use is recognized by international decisions. It must be regarded as of special weight when it is based on a series of facts linked together and leading logically to a single conclusion.^[15]^ Activities on computers owned by the government are “within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities.” Hence, the following assumption may be made: Where a malicious cyber activity creating a cyber security incident can be traced back to a government computer or computer system, the activity may be attributed to the government, unless it provides a satisfactory and convincing explanation that the system was externally used (i.e. has been hacked by someone else).^[16]^ ^[14] European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR), Salman v.

    "## B. No-Harm Principle In the *Corfu Channel* case the ICJ assumed a general duty to prevent harm. The Court ruled on a general principle to prevent harm as one of the bases for an Albanian duty to warn the British government: “[...] every State’s obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States.”¹⁹ The general principle has been developed in more detail in the area of international environmental law where good neighbourliness and a duty to prevent harm are considered to be part of customary law.²⁰ The main sources for this principle are the famous *Trail Smelter* arbitration²¹ and Principle 21 Stockholm Declaration/Principle 2 Rio Declaration.²² --- ¹⁷ International Law Commission (ILC), Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, GAOR, 56th Sess., Suppl. 10, 43 et seq.": "¹⁸ Cf. also Terry D. Gill, *Non-Intervention in the Cyber Context*, in: Ziolkowski (ed.)

(note 7).\n²² The Stockholm Declaration’s wording: “States have, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and the principles of international law, the sovereign right to exploit their own resources pursuant to their own environmental policies, and the responsibility to ensure that activities within their jurisdiction or control do not cause damage to the environment of other States or of areas beyond the limits of national jurisdiction”, Stockholm Declaration of the United Nations Conference GERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58 · 2015 These principles allow for the inclusion of harm caused by private actors.²³ In the *Corfu Channel* case mere knowledge by the Albanian authorities of the danger was sufficient, and in the *Trail Smelter* case the pollution emanated from a private plant. Thus, the principles of good neighbourliness and the duty to prevent harm extend the responsibility of States for private action beyond the strict criteria of Article 8 Articles on State Responsibility. To put the issue more generally: Responsibility of States for private action is not only caused by criteria of attribution, i.e. within the law of State responsibility, but also by the character of the primary obligations of States. Obligations of control and surveillance entail an indirect responsibility for private action if they are not respected. This reflects that there is an interaction in the law of State responsibility between the issue of attribution on the one side and the scope of the obligation of the State on the other.²⁴ In terms of the practical outcome, obligations of surveillance and control may thus constitute a substitute for the attribution of private action to a State.\nThe consequences which flow from the overall responsibility of States for harmful activities on their territory are, however, mitigated to some extent by additional criteria.\nFirst, the *Corfu Channel* formula requires “knowledge” on part of the State concerned. While the ICJ could operate with certain assumptions regarding the overall control of the territorial waters,²⁵ such an overall control certainly cannot be assumed with respect to any cyber activity on the territory of a given State.²⁶ Hence, the requirement of “knowledge” of the harmful activity will only be met in rare cases.\non the Human Environment, UN Doc.

It does not seem to be excluded, however, that these criteria are met in the context of cyber security incidents. For example, it has been argued that the DDoS attack on Estonia in 2007 constituted a case of “serious consequence”.²⁸ Irrespective of that it is today mostly recognised that international environmental law has developed beyond the Trail Smelter requirements.²⁹ Thus, the no-harm rule as it currently stands in customary international law only requires a certain *de minimis* threshold to be fulfilled³⁰ and the precautionary principle may be considered to have alleviated the strict Trail Smelter standard of proof.³¹ Finally, the Trail Smelter principle is further mitigated by the requirement of due diligence.³² Today “there is a clear consensus that although the no-harm principle does not say so explicitly, a State can only breach the principle if it fails to act with due diligence.”³³ According to the ILC in its Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities (Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm) both the magnitude and the probability of harm are to be taken ²⁷ For further elaboration on this see Russell A.

Hence, preventive action by States is both factually and legally considerably limited.",
    "## C. Precautionary Principle A similar scepticism relates to the precautionary principle, which would be the most obvious candidate for imposing preventive action. Indeed, the precautionary ³⁴ See the commentary to Art. 3 Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm, para. 11: “The standard of due diligence against which the conduct of the State of origin should be examined is that which is generally considered to be appropriate and proportional to the degree of risk of transboundary harm in the particular instance. For example, activities which may be considered ultrahazardous require a much higher standard of care in designing policies and a much higher degree of vigour on the part of the State to enforce them. Issues such as the size of the operation; its location, special climate conditions, materials used in the activity, and whether the conclusions drawn from the application of these factors in a specific case are reasonable, are among the factors to be considered in determining the due diligence requirement in each instance. What would be considered a reasonable standard of care or due diligence may change with time; what might be considered an appropriate and reasonable procedure, standard or rule at one point in time may not be considered as such at some point in the future. Hence, due diligence in ensuring safety requires a State to keep abreast of technological changes and scientific developments” (II.C, Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities, with Commentaries (2001), Report on the Work of its 53rd Session, UN Doc. A/56/10 (2001), 377); see also the definition of “risk of causing significant transboundary harm” in Art. 2 Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm: “The definition refers to two types of activities under these articles. One is where there is a low probability of causing disastrous harm. This is normally the characteristic of ultrahazardous activities. The other one is where there is a high probability of causing significant harm. This includes activities which have a high probability of causing harm which, while not disastrous, is still significant. But it would exclude activities where there is a very low probability of causing significant transboundary harm.” (ibid., commentary para. 3).": "³⁵ Beyerlin/Marauhn (note 32), 43.\n³⁶ For a discussion of the due diligence standard’s applicability in cyberspace regulation (with reference to the ‘duty of prevention’) see also Pirker (note 1), 206–209.\nOBLIGATIONS OF STATES 77 principle has assumed a prominent place in modern international law.³⁷ Although its legal basis in customary law is still being questioned,³⁸ there are clear indications to the contrary, notably regarding environmental impact assessments. The requirement to undertake an environmental impact assessment has been considered to be rooted in customary international law by several international decisions. The most prominent among them is the *Pulp Mills* case of the ICJ where the Court held that [...] it may now be considered a requirement under general international law to undertake an environmental impact assessment where there is a risk that the proposed industrial activity may have a significant adverse impact in a transboundary context [...].³⁹ Similar approaches were taken by arbitral tribunals in the *Iron Rhine Arbitration*⁴⁰ and the *Indus Waters Project*.⁴¹ It may therefore be assumed that at least in form of an environmental impact assessment the precautionary principle has entered general international law.\n³⁷ Jonathan B.

This duty, in the opinion of the Tribunal, has now become a principle of general international law”.\n⁴¹ *The Indus Waters Kishenganga Arbitration* (Pakistan, India), Partial Award of 18 February 2013, paras. 449 et seq., available at: http://www.pca-cpa.org/PK-IN%2020130218%20Partial%20Award%2018ba.pdf?fil_id=2101 (accessed on 11 November 2015): “There is no doubt that States are required under contemporary customary international law to take environmental protection into consideration when planning and developing projects that may cause injury to a bordering State. Since the time of Trail Smelter, a series of international conventions, declarations and judicial and arbitral decisions have addressed the need to manage natural resources in a sustainable manner. In particular, the International Court of Justice expounded upon the principle of ‘sustainable development’ in *Gabcikovo-Nagymaros*, referring to the ‘need to reconcile economic development with protection of the environment.’ Applied to large-scale construction projects, the principle of sustainable development translates, as the International Court of Justice recently put it in *Pulp Mills*, into ‘a requirement under general international law to undertake an environmental impact assessment where there is a risk that the proposed industrial activity may have a significant adverse impact in a transboundary context, in particular, on a shared resource’” (footnotes omitted).\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015 Could one transfer the concept into the cyber world in form of a ‘cyber impact assessment’ requirement?⁴² There are strong arguments against such a transposition. A starting point is that the environmental impact assessment relates to large industrial projects, which are considered to go along with specific risks for the environment. The possible sources of cyber security incidents cannot be narrowed down according to the scale of the activity. Each and every single computer, notebook, tablet, or smartphone could be the source of a cyber security incident. Hence, preventive cyber impact assessment would practically have to cover all activities in the internet. This would be incompatible with requirements of freedom of expression and communication and thus certainly go beyond what could be seen as part of general international law.",
    "## D. Summary Regarding Prevention In sum, the preventive obligations of States in the absence of concrete cyber security incidents remain rather limited. It is impossible to postulate a general obligation to preventively monitor cyber activities which are linked to the territory of a given State. Therefore, preventive obligations are basically limited to a prohibition to actively engage in malicious cyber activity and to respect due diligence standards regarding computers and systems which are under the control of the State.": "",
    "## IV. Procedural Obligations of Cooperation and Information (During and After a Cyber Security Incident) Does that situation change during or after a cyber security incident?": "",
    "## A. Good Neighbourliness as a General Source This article has already referred to the principle of good neighbourliness as a general source of cooperation and information. Indeed, Article 74 UN Charter codi ⁴² On the transferability of international environmental law rules to cyberspace activities see generally Marauhn (note 38), 481–482.": "OBLIGATIONS OF STATES 79 fies the principle of good neighbourliness regarding all matters of social, economic, and commercial matters. Based on the ICJ’s decision in the *Haya de la Torre* case,⁴³ the legal character of the principle of good neighbourliness is sometimes questioned.⁴⁴ The better view, however, rests its analysis on the frequent reference to the principle in many international treaties and concludes on a ‘hard-law content’ of the principle.⁴⁵ Irrespective of its hard law content, two problems remain when the concept of good neighbourliness is to be applied in the context of cyber security. The first relates to geographic proximity and the second to concrete obligations to be derived from the concept.\nUsually a certain geographic proximity of the States is required when the principle of good neighbourliness is invoked. It should be noted, however, that the United Nations General Assembly, already in 1991 and outside the context of the world wide web, extended the notion of good neighbourliness to all States of the international community “whether or not they are contiguous”.⁴⁶ Even if this approach is considered too far-reaching in the general context of all inter-State relations, a good point for universal neighbourliness may be made as far as relations through the internet are concerned. Effects of cyber activities are not limited to adjacent States but can be produced anywhere. Therefore, looked at from the perspective of its purpose, *i.e.* the obligations to duly take into account possible adverse effects on a neighbouring country, transferring the principle of good neighbourliness to the world wide web leads to its application in all inter-State relations, irrespective of the geographical location of the States concerned.\nAs far as concrete obligations under the principle of good neighbourliness are concerned, it is again international environmental law which provides for the best comparison. The most broadly accepted obligation concerns an obligation of information in case of emergency. Apart from that, there exist also general obligations of information, consultation, and notification in the absence of emergency situations.\n⁴³ ICJ, *Haya de la Torre* (Colombia *v.* Peru), Judgment of 13 June 1951, ICJ Reports 1951, 71.\n⁴⁴ See e.g. *Leland M. Goodrich/Edvard Hambro/Anne Patricia Simons*, Charter of the United Nations: Commentary and Documents (3rd ed. 1969), 463.\n⁴⁵ *Laurence Boisson de Chazournes/Danio Campanelli*, Neighbour States, MPEPIL, December 2006, para. 20, available *via*: http://www.mpepil.com (accessed on 8 June 2015); *Ulrich Fastenrath*, Article 74, in: Bruno Simma *et al.* (eds.), UN Charter Commentary (3rd ed. 2012), 1840, MN 2.\n⁴⁶ GA Res. 46/92 of 9 December 1991.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015 ## B. Emergency Information There is a clear customary duty to inform in cases of emergency. Evidence of this duty is – again – the Corfu Channel case where the ICJ considered Albania under an obligation to warn the British warship of the mines, similar obligations of warning are contained in a number of treaties relating to the environment.⁴⁷ One may also point to duties of information concerning infections “in the real world”. Article 6 World Health Organization (WHO) International Health Regulations⁴⁸ requires States to notify WHO, by the most efficient means of communication available, by way of the National IHR [International Health Regulations] Focal Point, and within 24 hours of assessment of public health information, of all events which may constitute a public health emergency of international concern within its territory [...] as well as any health measure implemented in response to those events.\nThus, in order to effectively combat their negative effects, virtual and real viruses may be treated alike.\nGiven the rapid connections via the internet, this information duty in cases of emergency may seem of limited value. On the other hand, one of the last epidemic attacks, the so-called conficker worm which primarily attacked Microsoft Windows operating systems, lasted over a period from 2008 to 2010, infecting among other institutions the German Bundeswehr, the French Navy, and the Greater Manchester Police.⁴⁹ During such a prolonged period, warning not only by the public concerned but also by States may help limiting the consequences.",
    "## C. Information, Consultation, and Notification Beyond Emergency Situations Obligations from the principle of good neighbourliness which relate to activities involving a risk of harm are not limited to the ex ante situation, i.e. before the activity ⁴⁷ For detailed references see *Birnie/Boyle/Redgwell* (note 20), 182 et seq.": "⁴⁸ Cf. Arts. 6 and 7 WHO International Health Regulations (2nd ed. 2005), WHA Doc. WHA 58.3, available at: http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2008/9789241580410_eng.pdf (accessed on 8 June 2015). For an analysis see *Sara E. Davies*, Is There an International Duty to Protect Persons in the Event of an Epidemic?, Global Health Governance (2010), available via: http://www.ghgj.org (accessed on 8 June 2015).\n⁴⁹ For more information on this worm see e.g. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conficker (accessed on 11 November 2015).\nOBLIGATIONS OF STATES 81 is started. This is explicitly spelled out in the ILC Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm.⁵⁰ Article 12 Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm contains a continuous obligation to exchange information.⁵¹ It would seem strange indeed if the obligations concerning information and consultation concerning environmental protection were to end once the project has started. Seen from this perspective, the continued duty to consult and inform once a project has started is basically a prolongation of the precautionary approach which creates obligations of prevention.\nAgainst this background one might be tempted to assume that – when transposed to the issue of cyber security incidents – a continued duty to consult and to inform encounters the same problems which have been highlighted concerning preventive action. However, there is an important factual difference which leads to a different analysis: At the preventive stage, *i.e.* prior to a concrete cyber security incident, it is not possible to limit the obligations to specific activities which may be considered particularly dangerous. By contrast, during or after a cyber security incident it is not unlikely that the State or States where the incident occurred or caused harmful consequences are able to narrow down possible sources and to give information on them. Under such circumstances the duty to provide information and to consult acquires a new and sufficiently specific content. Instead of being related to potentially all activities in the world wide web emanating from a specific country, the duty relates to activities which have proved harmful and thus present characteristics which allow them to be distinguished from other harmless activities. Under such circumstances it seems appropriate to assume a duty of cooperation on the part of the State where the activity allegedly emanated from and to oblige this State to share any information on the matter which is available to its authorities. In other words: While under the principle of good neighbourliness in the real world the size of a certain activity and the risks attached to it trigger general obligations of cooperation, in the cyber world it is the occurrence of a specific cyber security incident which triggers specific obligations of cooperation.\n⁵⁰ See *supra*, note 34.\n⁵¹ “While the activity is being carried out, the States concerned shall exchange in a timely manner all available information concerning that activity relevant to preventing significant transboundary harm or at any event minimizing the risk thereof. Such an exchange of information shall continue until such time as the States concerned consider it appropriate even after the activity is terminated”.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58 · 2015 In this context the question arises whether a certain standard of probability must be shown by the requesting State. The standard is not easy to circumscribe. It is certainly not enough if the source of the malicious activity is merely asserted. On the other hand, demanding full proof would most probably be a standard which is difficult to meet. While it is true that the ICJ in the *Oil Platforms* case demanded full proof by the United States (US) that the missile attack against their vessels constituted an armed attack by Iran on the US, which claimed to have reacted in self-defence,⁵² there is a decisive difference in the situation addressed here: The *Oil Platforms* case was about the justification of an otherwise unlawful use of force against another State. In the current context obligations of investigation and information are at issue. In other words: We are not talking about the legality of cross-border activity by one State against another, but about obligations of a State arising out of a specific situation over which it has at least territorial control. On the basis of the *Corfu Channel* case the standard of proof is lower: By reason of this exclusive control, the other State, the victim of a breach of international law, is often unable to furnish direct proof of facts giving rise to responsibility. Such a State should be allowed a more liberal recourse to inferences of fact and circumstantial evidence. This indirect evidence is admitted in all systems of law, and its use is recognized by international decisions. It must be regarded as of special weight when it is based on a series of facts linked together and leading logically to a single conclusion.⁵³ ## D. Cooperation in Investigation and Prosecution Another issue concerns obligations of investigation and prosecution. In order to be clear on the previous point of information and cooperation: The obligation to share information can only relate to information which is already available to the authorities. A certainly more far-reaching obligation would concern investigation and collection of information which is *not yet available*. It is to this point that I now want to turn.\n⁵² ICJ, *Case Concerning Oil Platforms* (Islamic Republic of Iran v. United States of America), Judgment of 6 November 2003, ICJ Reports 2003, 161, paras. 57 et seq.\n⁵³ See *id.*, *Corfu Channel* (note 15), 18.\nOBLIGATIONS OF STATES 83 ## 1. The General Framework for International Criminal Cooperation Under the general framework for international criminal cooperation there are only very limited generally applicable rules. Although the field is moving fast towards closer cooperation,⁵⁴ in the absence of specific treaty provisions mutual assistance in international criminal law is still dominated by traditional views on sovereignty which give the requested State broad discretion in whether at all, and if so under which conditions, it will meet a request for assistance.\nThe main tools which exist within the framework of international criminal cooperation concern requests for extradition and mutual assistance in other matters of criminal investigation, such as witnesses, evidence, etc. Regarding both institutions there are no general, but only specific obligations concerning either certain crimes (i.e. the application of the *aut dedere aut iudicare* principle to acts of terrorism) or the respective obligations are contained in specific treaties on mutual cooperation in criminal matters.",
    "## 2. Obligations Contained in the Budapest Convention The most elaborate treaty relating to international criminal cooperation concerning crimes related to cyberspace is, again, the Budapest Convention. Apart from defining cyber crime offences, the Convention requires its parties to enact certain investigative procedures for the inquiry into cyber crimes: expedited preservation of stored computer data (Article 16 Budapest Convention), preservation and disclosure of traffic data (Article 17 Budapest Convention), search and seizure of stored computer data (Article 19 Budapest Convention), real-time collection of traffic data (Article 20 Budapest Convention), and, finally, the interception of content data (Article 21 Budapest Convention).": "In its third part the Convention deals with international cooperation in the areas of extradition, mutual assistance, and establishment of permanent points of contact (Articles 23–35 Budapest Convention). These provisions explicitly take up obliga- ⁵⁴ *Tim René Salomon*, Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters, MPEPIL, January 2013, paras. 36 *et seq.*, available via: http://www.mpepil.com (accessed on 8 June 2015).\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015 tions which are contained in general treaties on extradition or mutual assistance and extend existing general obligations to cyber crimes as defined under the Budapest Convention (Article 24 (2) Budapest Convention and, with certain limits, Article 25 (4) Budapest Convention concerning mutual assistance).\nAccording to the working definition of cyber security incidents given above, every cyber security incident automatically constitutes a cyber crime under the Convention. Hence the procedural obligations of the Convention apply as far as States parties of the Budapest Convention are concerned. Given the fact that the focus of this analysis rests on general international law, the obligations under the Budapest Convention will, however, not be looked into in more detail.",
    "## 3. Transposing Obligations of Investigation Developed in International Human Rights Adjudication Another area of inspiration for obligations to investigate may be found in the jurisprudence of international human rights bodies relating to positive obligations of States in case of human rights violations. There is a clear and – it seems – widely accepted obligation to investigate in two groups of cases. The first has already been dealt with in the context of a reversal of the burden of proof, namely situations of complete control by the State (i.e. prisons and other institutions for detaining persons). On the basis of this jurisprudence it may be argued that an obligation to investigate arises where malicious cyber activity can be traced back to a computer or computer system controlled by another State. At first sight one might object that the situations of an individual human rights claim on the one side and inter-State obligations on the other are not compatible. There is, however, a common denominator which is the exclusive control of the State. In that regard, the two situations do not differ decisively. Hence, obligations of investigation may be assumed concerning computers and computer systems under the control of the government.": "",
    "## 4. Transborder Access to Data The issue of transborder access to data has gained a lot of public attention in recent days. The Budapest Convention left the issue deliberately open. Article 32 Budapest OBLIGATIONS OF STATES Convention only regulates the easy cases of data which is publicly available (lit. a) and consent by the person who has the lawful authority to disclose the data (lit. b). One might be tempted to conclude that the express regulation of only these two instances *e contrario* precludes any other transborder access to data. However, the explanatory report excludes this argument by referring to Article 39 Budapest Convention according to which other obligations are neither created nor precluded.⁵⁵ The issue of transborder access to data is currently being discussed in the context of a possible Additional Protocol to the Budapest Convention. If my reading of the papers which are publicly available⁵⁶ is correct, there are a number of different proposals on the table. Discussing them would probably require a paper on its own.": "For that reason I do not want to go into details of transborder access to data. I will limit my comments on this issue to one single point: If the analysis above is correct that under certain circumstances obligations of information and even of investigation may arise out of specific cyber security incidents, the argument may be made that transborder access to data may be justified as a countermeasure if a State does not meet its obligations of investigation (and the other conditions for lawful countermeasures are met).",
    "## V. Overall Assessment To conclude, the legal obligations of States before, during, and after a cyber security incident can be summarised in two final points: ⁵⁵ Council of Europe, Explanatory Report to the Convention on Cybercrime, para. 293, available at: https://rm.coe.int/CoERMPublicCommonSearchServices/DisplayDCTMContent?documentId=09000016800ce5b (accessed on 6 November 2015).

On the basis of this assumption, the author inquires into possible principles and rules established in general international law which could be relied on in order to address cyber security incidents, i.e. inter-State conflicts relating to cyberspace which remain below the threshold of the notions of use of force or armed conflict.\nRelying mainly on principles established in international environmental law, it is argued that the principle of good neighbourliness is the most promising candidate for developing obligations of cooperation and assistance in dealing with malicious cyber activities. However, one crucial difference between hazardous activities relating to the environment and threats in cyberspace is spelled out: In contrast to activities with potential dangers for the environment, with regard to the internet it is impossible to distinguish 'hazardous' activities from non-hazardous activities. For this reason it is impossible to establish thresholds or activities in cyberspace which could serve as triggers for preventive obligations. As a consequence, the focus must be laid on obligations of cooperation and assistance during and after a cyber security incident, rather than at the preventive stage.\nKEYWORDS: Cyber Security, Good Neighbourliness, Corfu Channel Case, Burden of Proof, Prevention, Obligations of Cooperation\n## I. Introduction\nThe internet presents many challenges to international law. Its virtual character is considered to put into question the principle of territoriality which in many areas is fundamental to international law as it currently stands. The rapidity of cyber activity requires swift and often coordinated if not collective action by more than one State.\n* Professor for Public and Public International Law, Institute for International Law, Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Munich.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58 · 2015\nFinally, private actors play an important role. This means, on the one side, that issues of State responsibility for private activities have to be addressed, and on the other, that human rights issues must be taken into account. All of this does not fit easily into the inter-State paradigm of mutual obligations between States. The following considerations thus necessarily are of a preliminary, explorative character.\n## II. General Assumptions\n## A. Concerning the Role of States\nA first general assumption relates to the role of States in regulating the internet. In contrast to some positions in literature, in the following the internet is not viewed as a legal space which is distinct from the territory of States and thus subject to its own, independent legal regime. The internet certainly has an important transnational dimension, but that does not mean that it is intrinsically transnational and cannot be made subject to regulations from individual States. Rather, the following considerations are based on a territorial approach according to which ‘the Internet’ is viewed as being – at least in most parts – covered by the authority of the State on whose territory a specific activity in question takes place, i.e. where a person physically conducts his or her malicious activity or where a server or computer on which the activity takes place is located.\nSpecific problems may arise in the context of data which move frequently between different servers and different locations. Given the frequency and rapidity with which the location of data may be changed, the situation of such data has been described as a “loss of location”. However, these specific problems of ‘data in the cloud(s)’ may\n Eneken Tikk, Ten Rules for Cyber Security, Survival: Global Politics and Strategy 53 (2011), 119, 121; Johann-Christoph Woltag, Computer Network Operations Below the Level of Armed Force, European Society of International Law (ESIL) Conference Paper No. 1/2011, 12, available via: http://www.esil-sedi.eu/node/697 (accessed on 31 October 2015); Benedikt Pirker, Territorial Integrity and the Challenges of Cyberspace, in: Katharina Ziolkowski (ed.), Peacetime Regime for State Activities in Cyberspace (2013), 189, 193 et seq. For a similar approach see Art. 22 (1)(a)–(c) Convention on Cybercrime, 23 November 2001, ETS No. 185 (Budapest Convention); specific problems of activities in internationalised territories such as the high seas are left aside, given their presumably small practical relevance.\n Council of Europe, Economic Crime Division, Cloud Computing and Cybercrime Investigations: Territoriality vs. the Power of Disposal?, Discussion Paper, 31 August 2010, available at: rm.coe.int/\nOBLIGATIONS OF STATES 69\nrequire specific methods of inquiry and access, but they do not change the fundamental principle of territoriality.\n## B. Concerning the Term ‘Cyber Security Incident’\nThe term ‘cyber security incident’ is vague. It competes with other notions such as ‘cyber warfare’, ‘cyber terrorism’, ‘cyber conflict’, ‘cyber threat’, ‘cyber crime’, or ‘cyber attack’. Some of these terms go along with certain strategies to ensure cyber security: ‘Cyber crime’ suggests a criminal law approach, ‘cyber warfare’ obviously alludes to use of force and international humanitarian law, etc.\n‘Cyber security incident’ may cover incidents as different as the distributed denial of service attack (DDoS) on the Estonian public computer system in 2007, the Stuxnet worm, which was apparently specifically designed for halting the Iranian nuclear programme, the hacking of computer systems of private companies for the purpose of industrial espionage and other cases of internet torts, hacktivist actions for the promotion of political ideas, etc. One could even include the military dimension under the label of ‘cyber security incident’. However, given that most malicious cyber activity does not reach the level of armed force, only incidents remaining below\nCoERM Public Common Search Services / Display DCTM Content? document Id=09000016802fa3df (accessed on 31 October 2015); see also Cybercrime Convention Committee (T-CY), (Draft) Elements of an Additional Protocol to the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime regarding transborder access to data, 9 April 2013, T-CY (2013)14, available at: https://www.coe.int/t/dghl/cooperation/economic crime/Source/Cybercrime/TCY/TCY%202013/T-CY%282013%2914transb_elements_protocol_V2.pdf (accessed on 11 November 2015).\n See, for an attempt to clarify the relationship of several competing notions, Oona A.

In order to further clarify the notion of ‘cyber security incident’, it is helpful to look at the Convention on Cybercrime (Budapest Convention).\n## C. The CoE Convention on Cybercrime (Budapest Convention)\nA few words concerning the Budapest Convention are in place by way of introduction: The Convention is the most comprehensive binding international document relating to cyber security. Currently the Budapest Convention has 47 parties, among them several States who are not members of the Council of Europe (USA, Japan, Australia, and the Dominican Republic). There are further non-European signatories which have not yet ratified the Convention (Canada and South Africa). The Convention follows a criminal law approach and seeks to harmonise national laws by defining certain computer-related offences and setting minimum standards for the methods of their investigation and concerning the cooperation between States.\nThe definition covers offences against the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of computer-related data and systems (Articles 2–6 Budapest Convention), computer-related offences (forgery and fraud, Articles 7 and 8 Budapest Convention), content-related offences (child pornography, Article 9 Budapest Convention), and finally offences relating to infringements of copyright and related rights (Article 10 Budapest Convention).\n Charter of the United Nations, 26 June 1945, UNCIO 15, 335 (UN Charter).\n See supra, note 1. For a recent account of the Convention see Sophie Kwasny, Lutte contre la cybercriminalité et respect des droits de l'homme: Les instruments du Conseil de l'Europe, in: Société Française Pour le Droit International (ed.), Internet et le droit international: Colloque de Rouen (2014), 339.\n See e.g. Paul Rosenzweig, International Law and Private Actor Active Cyber Defensive Measures, Stanford Journal of International Law 50 (2014), 103, 108; Hathaway et al. (note 3), 862.\n For an analysis see Michael A. Vatis, The Council of Europe Convention on Cyber Crime, in: National Research Council (ed.), Proceedings of a Workshop on Deterring Cyber-Attacks: Informing Strategies and Developing Options for U.S. Policy (2010), 207; Robert Uerpmann-Wittzack, Internet-völkerrecht, Archiv des Völkerrechts 47 (2009), 261, 269–270.\nOBLIGATIONS OF STATES 71\nDue to its criminal law approach, the Budapest Convention includes issues which are not related to inter-State security or to obligations incumbent upon States to ensure that their territories are not used for purposes which are harmful to other States. A more limited approach is therefore warranted for the purposes of this contribution. Accordingly, I propose to limit the notion of ‘cyber security incident’ to those crimes which relate to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of computer data and systems. A cyber security incident thus occurs whenever computers or computer systems are illegally accessed or destroyed or when data are illegally intercepted, deleted, or altered.\n## III. General Obligations of Prevention\nThe first phase of possible obligations relates to the situation prior to a cyber security incident. In this phase obligations of prevention are of interest. These aspects will be dealt with first (III.). In a second step obligations of cooperation and information will be dealt with (IV.). These obligations are mostly relevant during or after a cyber security incident has occurred.\n## A. Principle of Non-Intervention\nThe most fundamental principle applicable is the principle of non-intervention. According to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) it is “part and parcel of customary international law”. When a State uses the internet in order to destabilise another country, this constitutes a violation of the principle of non-intervention. Similarly, cyber-based activities of organs of one State on computers situated in another country or relating to parts of the web situated in another country would infringe upon the latter country’s sovereignty.\nIn this area, issues such as attribution, standards of proof, etc. are more important than the substantive law, which is quite clear. In that regard, it is necessary to distinguish between computers and computer systems belonging to the government and\n International Court of Justice (ICJ), *Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua* (Nicaragua v.

Computers belonging to the government may be presumed to be controlled by the government. Ideas for distributing responsibility under such circumstances may be borrowed from the jurisprudence and practice of human rights bodies regarding persons who are in complete control of State agents.\nThe European Court of Human Rights, for instance, argues as follows:\nWhere the events in issue lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of persons within their control in custody, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries and death occurring during such detention. Indeed, the burden of proof may be regarded as resting on the authorities to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation.^[14]^\nThe factor of exclusive control was also taken into consideration by the ICJ in developing its standard of proof in the Corfu Channel case:\n[...] the fact of this exclusive territorial control exercised by a State within its frontiers has a bearing upon the methods of proof available to establish the knowledge of that State as to such events. By reason of this exclusive control, the other State, the victim of a breach of international law, is often unable to furnish direct proof of facts giving rise to responsibility. Such a State should be allowed a more liberal recourse to inferences of fact and circumstantial evidence. This indirect evidence is admitted in all systems of law, and its use is recognized by international decisions. It must be regarded as of special weight when it is based on a series of facts linked together and leading logically to a single conclusion.^[15]^\nActivities on computers owned by the government are “within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities.” Hence, the following assumption may be made: Where a malicious cyber activity creating a cyber security incident can be traced back to a government computer or computer system, the activity may be attributed to the government, unless it provides a satisfactory and convincing explanation that the system was externally used (i.e. has been hacked by someone else).^[16]^\n^[14] European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR), Salman v.

Hence, it is necessary to establish that the activity in question was executed “on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct.” Usually it will be impossible to meet this standard. It is therefore necessary to ask whether there are further obligations of control or prevention which include activities of private actors.\n## B. No-Harm Principle\nIn the *Corfu Channel* case the ICJ assumed a general duty to prevent harm. The Court ruled on a general principle to prevent harm as one of the bases for an Albanian duty to warn the British government: “[...] every State’s obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States.”\nThe general principle has been developed in more detail in the area of international environmental law where good neighbourliness and a duty to prevent harm are considered to be part of customary law. The main sources for this principle are the famous *Trail Smelter* arbitration and Principle 21 Stockholm Declaration/Principle 2 Rio Declaration.\n---\n International Law Commission (ILC), Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, GAOR, 56th Sess., Suppl. 10, 43 et seq.\n Cf. also Terry D.

(note 7).\n The Stockholm Declaration’s wording: “States have, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and the principles of international law, the sovereign right to exploit their own resources pursuant to their own environmental policies, and the responsibility to ensure that activities within their jurisdiction or control do not cause damage to the environment of other States or of areas beyond the limits of national jurisdiction”, Stockholm Declaration of the United Nations Conference\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58 · 2015\nThese principles allow for the inclusion of harm caused by private actors. In the *Corfu Channel* case mere knowledge by the Albanian authorities of the danger was sufficient, and in the *Trail Smelter* case the pollution emanated from a private plant. Thus, the principles of good neighbourliness and the duty to prevent harm extend the responsibility of States for private action beyond the strict criteria of Article 8 Articles on State Responsibility. To put the issue more generally: Responsibility of States for private action is not only caused by criteria of attribution, i.e. within the law of State responsibility, but also by the character of the primary obligations of States. Obligations of control and surveillance entail an indirect responsibility for private action if they are not respected. This reflects that there is an interaction in the law of State responsibility between the issue of attribution on the one side and the scope of the obligation of the State on the other. In terms of the practical outcome, obligations of surveillance and control may thus constitute a substitute for the attribution of private action to a State.\nThe consequences which flow from the overall responsibility of States for harmful activities on their territory are, however, mitigated to some extent by additional criteria.\nFirst, the *Corfu Channel* formula requires “knowledge” on part of the State concerned. While the ICJ could operate with certain assumptions regarding the overall control of the territorial waters, such an overall control certainly cannot be assumed with respect to any cyber activity on the territory of a given State. Hence, the requirement of “knowledge” of the harmful activity will only be met in rare cases.\non the Human Environment, UN Doc. A/CONF.48/14 (1972), 3–5; Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, UN Doc.

Drumbl*, Trail Smelter and the International Law Commission’s Work on State Responsibility for Internationally Wrongful Acts and State Liability, in: Bratspies/Miller (eds.) (note 7), 86 et seq.\n ICJ, *Corfu Channel* (note 15), 18 et seq.\n Cf. *Pirker* (note 1), 204 et seq., also discussing some alternative conceptions.\nOBLIGATIONS OF STATES 75\nSecondly, the Trail Smelter principle has originally been restricted in its scope by the requirement of “serious consequence” being established by “clear and convincing evidence”. It does not seem to be excluded, however, that these criteria are met in the context of cyber security incidents. For example, it has been argued that the DDoS attack on Estonia in 2007 constituted a case of “serious consequence”. Irrespective of that it is today mostly recognised that international environmental law has developed beyond the Trail Smelter requirements. Thus, the no-harm rule as it currently stands in customary international law only requires a certain *de minimis* threshold to be fulfilled and the precautionary principle may be considered to have alleviated the strict Trail Smelter standard of proof.\nFinally, the Trail Smelter principle is further mitigated by the requirement of due diligence. Today “there is a clear consensus that although the no-harm principle does not say so explicitly, a State can only breach the principle if it fails to act with due diligence.” According to the ILC in its Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities (Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm) both the magnitude and the probability of harm are to be taken\n For further elaboration on this see Russell A.

Further minimum requirements are foreseeability for the State concerned and respect of the best scientific knowledge.\nIf these due diligence requirements are taken into consideration, it must be questioned whether one can expect a significant contribution of the no-harm rule to the prevention of cyber security incidents. While it may be worthwhile to explore the technological possibilities of prevention to some extent, it cannot be overlooked that a preventive surveillance of all cyber activities neither seems to be a technical possibility nor would it meet human rights standards of freedom of expression and communication. Hence, preventive action by States is both factually and legally considerably limited.\n## C. Precautionary Principle\nA similar scepticism relates to the precautionary principle, which would be the most obvious candidate for imposing preventive action. Indeed, the precautionary\n See the commentary to Art. 3 Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm, para. 11: “The standard of due diligence against which the conduct of the State of origin should be examined is that which is generally considered to be appropriate and proportional to the degree of risk of transboundary harm in the particular instance. For example, activities which may be considered ultrahazardous require a much higher standard of care in designing policies and a much higher degree of vigour on the part of the State to enforce them. Issues such as the size of the operation; its location, special climate conditions, materials used in the activity, and whether the conclusions drawn from the application of these factors in a specific case are reasonable, are among the factors to be considered in determining the due diligence requirement in each instance. What would be considered a reasonable standard of care or due diligence may change with time; what might be considered an appropriate and reasonable procedure, standard or rule at one point in time may not be considered as such at some point in the future. Hence, due diligence in ensuring safety requires a State to keep abreast of technological changes and scientific developments” (II.C, Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities, with Commentaries (2001), Report on the Work of its 53rd Session, UN Doc. A/56/10 (2001), 377); see also the definition of “risk of causing significant transboundary harm” in Art. 2 Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm: “The definition refers to two types of activities under these articles. One is where there is a low probability of causing disastrous harm. This is normally the characteristic of ultrahazardous activities. The other one is where there is a high probability of causing significant harm. This includes activities which have a high probability of causing harm which, while not disastrous, is still significant. But it would exclude activities where there is a very low probability of causing significant transboundary harm.” (ibid., commentary para. 3).\n Beyerlin/Marauhn (note 32), 43.\n For a discussion of the due diligence standard’s applicability in cyberspace regulation (with reference to the ‘duty of prevention’) see also Pirker (note 1), 206–209.\nOBLIGATIONS OF STATES 77\nprinciple has assumed a prominent place in modern international law. Although its legal basis in customary law is still being questioned, there are clear indications to the contrary, notably regarding environmental impact assessments. The requirement to undertake an environmental impact assessment has been considered to be rooted in customary international law by several international decisions. The most prominent among them is the *Pulp Mills* case of the ICJ where the Court held that\n[...] it may now be considered a requirement under general international law to undertake an environmental impact assessment where there is a risk that the proposed industrial activity may have a significant adverse impact in a transboundary context [...].\nSimilar approaches were taken by arbitral tribunals in the *Iron Rhine Arbitration* and the *Indus Waters Project*. It may therefore be assumed that at least in form of an environmental impact assessment the precautionary principle has entered general international law.\n Jonathan B. Wiener, *Precaution*, in: Daniel Bodansky/Jutta Brunnée/Ellen Hey (eds.), Oxford Handbook on International Environmental Law (2007), 597, 599.\n See *Thilo Marauhn*, *Customary Rules of International Environmental Law: Can they Provide Guidance for Developing a Peacetime Regime for Cyberspace?*, in: *Ziolkowski* (ed.) (note 1), 465, 474–476, taking a critical stance on the precautionary principle’s prospects for application in cyber contexts.\n ICJ, *Case Concerning Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay* (Argentina v. Uruguay), Judgment of 20 April 2010, ICJ Reports 2010, 14, para. 204.\n *Arbitration Regarding the Iron Rhine (‘Ijzeren Rijn’) Railway* (Belgium, The Netherlands), Arbitral Award of 24 May 2005, RIAA XXVII, para. 59: “Environmental law and the law on development stand not as alternatives but as mutually reinforcing, integral concepts, which require that where development may cause significant harm to the environment there is a duty to prevent, or at least mitigate, such harm (see paragraph 222). This duty, in the opinion of the Tribunal, has now become a principle of general international law”.\n *The Indus Waters Kishenganga Arbitration* (Pakistan, India), Partial Award of 18 February 2013, paras. 449 et seq., available at: http://www.pca-cpa.org/PK-IN%2020130218%20Partial%20Award%2018ba.pdf?fil_id=2101 (accessed on 11 November 2015): “There is no doubt that States are required under contemporary customary international law to take environmental protection into consideration when planning and developing projects that may cause injury to a bordering State. Since the time of Trail Smelter, a series of international conventions, declarations and judicial and arbitral decisions have addressed the need to manage natural resources in a sustainable manner. In particular, the International Court of Justice expounded upon the principle of ‘sustainable development’ in *Gabcikovo-Nagymaros*, referring to the ‘need to reconcile economic development with protection of the environment.’ Applied to large-scale construction projects, the principle of sustainable development translates, as the International Court of Justice recently put it in *Pulp Mills*, into ‘a requirement under general international law to undertake an environmental impact assessment where there is a risk that the proposed industrial activity may have a significant adverse impact in a transboundary context, in particular, on a shared resource’” (footnotes omitted).\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\nCould one transfer the concept into the cyber world in form of a ‘cyber impact assessment’ requirement? There are strong arguments against such a transposition. A starting point is that the environmental impact assessment relates to large industrial projects, which are considered to go along with specific risks for the environment. The possible sources of cyber security incidents cannot be narrowed down according to the scale of the activity. Each and every single computer, notebook, tablet, or smartphone could be the source of a cyber security incident. Hence, preventive cyber impact assessment would practically have to cover all activities in the internet. This would be incompatible with requirements of freedom of expression and communication and thus certainly go beyond what could be seen as part of general international law.\n## D. Summary Regarding Prevention\nIn sum, the preventive obligations of States in the absence of concrete cyber security incidents remain rather limited. It is impossible to postulate a general obligation to preventively monitor cyber activities which are linked to the territory of a given State. Therefore, preventive obligations are basically limited to a prohibition to actively engage in malicious cyber activity and to respect due diligence standards regarding computers and systems which are under the control of the State.\n## IV. Procedural Obligations of Cooperation and Information (During and After a Cyber Security Incident)\nDoes that situation change during or after a cyber security incident?\n## A. Good Neighbourliness as a General Source\nThis article has already referred to the principle of good neighbourliness as a general source of cooperation and information. Indeed, Article 74 UN Charter codi\n On the transferability of international environmental law rules to cyberspace activities see generally Marauhn (note 38), 481–482.\nOBLIGATIONS OF STATES 79\nfies the principle of good neighbourliness regarding all matters of social, economic, and commercial matters. Based on the ICJ’s decision in the *Haya de la Torre* case, the legal character of the principle of good neighbourliness is sometimes questioned. The better view, however, rests its analysis on the frequent reference to the principle in many international treaties and concludes on a ‘hard-law content’ of the principle. Irrespective of its hard law content, two problems remain when the concept of good neighbourliness is to be applied in the context of cyber security. The first relates to geographic proximity and the second to concrete obligations to be derived from the concept.\nUsually a certain geographic proximity of the States is required when the principle of good neighbourliness is invoked. It should be noted, however, that the United Nations General Assembly, already in 1991 and outside the context of the world wide web, extended the notion of good neighbourliness to all States of the international community “whether or not they are contiguous”. Even if this approach is considered too far-reaching in the general context of all inter-State relations, a good point for universal neighbourliness may be made as far as relations through the internet are concerned. Effects of cyber activities are not limited to adjacent States but can be produced anywhere. Therefore, looked at from the perspective of its purpose, *i.e.* the obligations to duly take into account possible adverse effects on a neighbouring country, transferring the principle of good neighbourliness to the world wide web leads to its application in all inter-State relations, irrespective of the geographical location of the States concerned.\nAs far as concrete obligations under the principle of good neighbourliness are concerned, it is again international environmental law which provides for the best comparison. The most broadly accepted obligation concerns an obligation of information in case of emergency. Apart from that, there exist also general obligations of information, consultation, and notification in the absence of emergency situations.\n ICJ, *Haya de la Torre* (Colombia *v.* Peru), Judgment of 13 June 1951, ICJ Reports 1951, 71.\n See e.g. *Leland M. Goodrich/Edvard Hambro/Anne Patricia Simons*, Charter of the United Nations: Commentary and Documents (3rd ed. 1969), 463.\n *Laurence Boisson de Chazournes/Danio Campanelli*, Neighbour States, MPEPIL, December 2006, para. 20, available *via*: http://www.mpepil.com (accessed on 8 June 2015); *Ulrich Fastenrath*, Article 74, in: Bruno Simma *et al.* (eds.), UN Charter Commentary (3rd ed. 2012), 1840, MN 2.\n GA Res. 46/92 of 9 December 1991.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\n## B. Emergency Information\nThere is a clear customary duty to inform in cases of emergency. Evidence of this duty is – again – the Corfu Channel case where the ICJ considered Albania under an obligation to warn the British warship of the mines, similar obligations of warning are contained in a number of treaties relating to the environment. One may also point to duties of information concerning infections “in the real world”. Article 6 World Health Organization (WHO) International Health Regulations requires States to\nnotify WHO, by the most efficient means of communication available, by way of the National IHR [International Health Regulations] Focal Point, and within 24 hours of assessment of public health information, of all events which may constitute a public health emergency of international concern within its territory [...] as well as any health measure implemented in response to those events.\nThus, in order to effectively combat their negative effects, virtual and real viruses may be treated alike.\nGiven the rapid connections via the internet, this information duty in cases of emergency may seem of limited value. On the other hand, one of the last epidemic attacks, the so-called conficker worm which primarily attacked Microsoft Windows operating systems, lasted over a period from 2008 to 2010, infecting among other institutions the German Bundeswehr, the French Navy, and the Greater Manchester Police. During such a prolonged period, warning not only by the public concerned but also by States may help limiting the consequences.\n## C. Information, Consultation, and Notification Beyond Emergency Situations\nObligations from the principle of good neighbourliness which relate to activities involving a risk of harm are not limited to the ex ante situation, i.e. before the activity\n For detailed references see *Birnie/Boyle/Redgwell* (note 20), 182 et seq.\n Cf. Arts. 6 and 7 WHO International Health Regulations (2nd ed. 2005), WHA Doc. WHA 58.3, available at: http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2008/9789241580410_eng.pdf (accessed on 8 June 2015).

Davies*, Is There an International Duty to Protect Persons in the Event of an Epidemic?, Global Health Governance (2010), available via: http://www.ghgj.org (accessed on 8 June 2015).\n For more information on this worm see e.g. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conficker (accessed on 11 November 2015).\nOBLIGATIONS OF STATES 81\nis started. This is explicitly spelled out in the ILC Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm. Article 12 Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm contains a continuous obligation to exchange information. It would seem strange indeed if the obligations concerning information and consultation concerning environmental protection were to end once the project has started. Seen from this perspective, the continued duty to consult and inform once a project has started is basically a prolongation of the precautionary approach which creates obligations of prevention.\nAgainst this background one might be tempted to assume that – when transposed to the issue of cyber security incidents – a continued duty to consult and to inform encounters the same problems which have been highlighted concerning preventive action. However, there is an important factual difference which leads to a different analysis: At the preventive stage, *i.e.* prior to a concrete cyber security incident, it is not possible to limit the obligations to specific activities which may be considered particularly dangerous. By contrast, during or after a cyber security incident it is not unlikely that the State or States where the incident occurred or caused harmful consequences are able to narrow down possible sources and to give information on them. Under such circumstances the duty to provide information and to consult acquires a new and sufficiently specific content. Instead of being related to potentially all activities in the world wide web emanating from a specific country, the duty relates to activities which have proved harmful and thus present characteristics which allow them to be distinguished from other harmless activities. Under such circumstances it seems appropriate to assume a duty of cooperation on the part of the State where the activity allegedly emanated from and to oblige this State to share any information on the matter which is available to its authorities. In other words: While under the principle of good neighbourliness in the real world the size of a certain activity and the risks attached to it trigger general obligations of cooperation, in the cyber world it is the occurrence of a specific cyber security incident which triggers specific obligations of cooperation.\n See *supra*, note 34.\n “While the activity is being carried out, the States concerned shall exchange in a timely manner all available information concerning that activity relevant to preventing significant transboundary harm or at any event minimizing the risk thereof. Such an exchange of information shall continue until such time as the States concerned consider it appropriate even after the activity is terminated”.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58 · 2015\nIn this context the question arises whether a certain standard of probability must be shown by the requesting State. The standard is not easy to circumscribe. It is certainly not enough if the source of the malicious activity is merely asserted. On the other hand, demanding full proof would most probably be a standard which is difficult to meet. While it is true that the ICJ in the *Oil Platforms* case demanded full proof by the United States (US) that the missile attack against their vessels constituted an armed attack by Iran on the US, which claimed to have reacted in self-defence, there is a decisive difference in the situation addressed here: The *Oil Platforms* case was about the justification of an otherwise unlawful use of force against another State. In the current context obligations of investigation and information are at issue. In other words: We are not talking about the legality of cross-border activity by one State against another, but about obligations of a State arising out of a specific situation over which it has at least territorial control. On the basis of the *Corfu Channel* case the standard of proof is lower:\nBy reason of this exclusive control, the other State, the victim of a breach of international law, is often unable to furnish direct proof of facts giving rise to responsibility. Such a State should be allowed a more liberal recourse to inferences of fact and circumstantial evidence. This indirect evidence is admitted in all systems of law, and its use is recognized by international decisions. It must be regarded as of special weight when it is based on a series of facts linked together and leading logically to a single conclusion.\n## D. Cooperation in Investigation and Prosecution\nAnother issue concerns obligations of investigation and prosecution. In order to be clear on the previous point of information and cooperation: The obligation to share information can only relate to information which is already available to the authorities. A certainly more far-reaching obligation would concern investigation and collection of information which is *not yet available*. It is to this point that I now want to turn.\n ICJ, *Case Concerning Oil Platforms* (Islamic Republic of Iran v. United States of America), Judgment of 6 November 2003, ICJ Reports 2003, 161, paras. 57 et seq.\n See *id.*, *Corfu Channel* (note 15), 18.\nOBLIGATIONS OF STATES 83\n## 1. The General Framework for International Criminal Cooperation\nUnder the general framework for international criminal cooperation there are only very limited generally applicable rules. Although the field is moving fast towards closer cooperation, in the absence of specific treaty provisions mutual assistance in international criminal law is still dominated by traditional views on sovereignty which give the requested State broad discretion in whether at all, and if so under which conditions, it will meet a request for assistance.\nThe main tools which exist within the framework of international criminal cooperation concern requests for extradition and mutual assistance in other matters of criminal investigation, such as witnesses, evidence, etc. Regarding both institutions there are no general, but only specific obligations concerning either certain crimes (i.e. the application of the *aut dedere aut iudicare* principle to acts of terrorism) or the respective obligations are contained in specific treaties on mutual cooperation in criminal matters.\n## 2. Obligations Contained in the Budapest Convention\nThe most elaborate treaty relating to international criminal cooperation concerning crimes related to cyberspace is, again, the Budapest Convention. Apart from defining cyber crime offences, the Convention requires its parties to enact certain investigative procedures for the inquiry into cyber crimes: expedited preservation of stored computer data (Article 16 Budapest Convention), preservation and disclosure of traffic data (Article 17 Budapest Convention), search and seizure of stored computer data (Article 19 Budapest Convention), real-time collection of traffic data (Article 20 Budapest Convention), and, finally, the interception of content data (Article 21 Budapest Convention).\nIn its third part the Convention deals with international cooperation in the areas of extradition, mutual assistance, and establishment of permanent points of contact (Articles 23–35 Budapest Convention). These provisions explicitly take up obliga-\n *Tim René Salomon*, Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters, MPEPIL, January 2013, paras. 36 *et seq.*, available via: http://www.mpepil.com (accessed on 8 June 2015).\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\ntions which are contained in general treaties on extradition or mutual assistance and extend existing general obligations to cyber crimes as defined under the Budapest Convention (Article 24 (2) Budapest Convention and, with certain limits, Article 25 (4) Budapest Convention concerning mutual assistance).\nAccording to the working definition of cyber security incidents given above, every cyber security incident automatically constitutes a cyber crime under the Convention. Hence the procedural obligations of the Convention apply as far as States parties of the Budapest Convention are concerned. Given the fact that the focus of this analysis rests on general international law, the obligations under the Budapest Convention will, however, not be looked into in more detail.\n## 3. Transposing Obligations of Investigation Developed in International Human Rights Adjudication\nAnother area of inspiration for obligations to investigate may be found in the jurisprudence of international human rights bodies relating to positive obligations of States in case of human rights violations. There is a clear and – it seems – widely accepted obligation to investigate in two groups of cases. The first has already been dealt with in the context of a reversal of the burden of proof, namely situations of complete control by the State (i.e. prisons and other institutions for detaining persons). On the basis of this jurisprudence it may be argued that an obligation to investigate arises where malicious cyber activity can be traced back to a computer or computer system controlled by another State. At first sight one might object that the situations of an individual human rights claim on the one side and inter-State obligations on the other are not compatible. There is, however, a common denominator which is the exclusive control of the State. In that regard, the two situations do not differ decisively. Hence, obligations of investigation may be assumed concerning computers and computer systems under the control of the government.\n## 4. Transborder Access to Data\nThe issue of transborder access to data has gained a lot of public attention in recent days. The Budapest Convention left the issue deliberately open. Article 32 Budapest\nOBLIGATIONS OF STATES\nConvention only regulates the easy cases of data which is publicly available (lit. a) and consent by the person who has the lawful authority to disclose the data (lit. b). One might be tempted to conclude that the express regulation of only these two instances *e contrario* precludes any other transborder access to data. However, the explanatory report excludes this argument by referring to Article 39 Budapest Convention according to which other obligations are neither created nor precluded.\nThe issue of transborder access to data is currently being discussed in the context of a possible Additional Protocol to the Budapest Convention. If my reading of the papers which are publicly available is correct, there are a number of different proposals on the table. Discussing them would probably require a paper on its own.\nFor that reason I do not want to go into details of transborder access to data. I will limit my comments on this issue to one single point: If the analysis above is correct that under certain circumstances obligations of information and even of investigation may arise out of specific cyber security incidents, the argument may be made that transborder access to data may be justified as a countermeasure if a State does not meet its obligations of investigation (and the other conditions for lawful countermeasures are met).\n## V. Overall Assessment\nTo conclude, the legal obligations of States before, during, and after a cyber security incident can be summarised in two final points:\n1. All States are cyber neighbours. Therefore, in general international law the principle of good neighbourliness is the most promising candidate for developing obligations of cooperation and assistance in dealing with malicious cyber activities. The most important challenge consists in the fact that it is impossible to distin\n Council of Europe, Explanatory Report to the Convention on Cybercrime, para. 293, available at: https://rm.coe.int/CoERMPublicCommonSearchServices/DisplayDCTMContent?documentId=09000016800ce5b (accessed on 6 November 2015).

As a consequence of this specific characteristic of cyber activities the focus must be laid on obligations of cooperation during and after a cyber security incident, rather than at the preventive stage.",

On the basis of this assumption, the author inquires into possible principles and rules established in general international law which could be relied on in order to address cyber security incidents, i.e. inter-State conflicts relating to cyberspace which remain below the threshold of the notions of use of force or armed conflict.\nRelying mainly on principles established in international environmental law, it is argued that the principle of good neighbourliness is the most promising candidate for developing obligations of cooperation and assistance in dealing with malicious cyber activities. However, one crucial difference between hazardous activities relating to the environment and threats in cyberspace is spelled out: In contrast to activities with potential dangers for the environment, with regard to the internet it is impossible to distinguish 'hazardous' activities from non-hazardous activities. For this reason it is impossible to establish thresholds or activities in cyberspace which could serve as triggers for preventive obligations. As a consequence, the focus must be laid on obligations of cooperation and assistance during and after a cyber security incident, rather than at the preventive stage.\nKEYWORDS: Cyber Security, Good Neighbourliness, Corfu Channel Case, Burden of Proof, Prevention, Obligations of Cooperation\n## I. Introduction\nThe internet presents many challenges to international law. Its virtual character is considered to put into question the principle of territoriality which in many areas is fundamental to international law as it currently stands. The rapidity of cyber activity requires swift and often coordinated if not collective action by more than one State.\n* Professor for Public and Public International Law, Institute for International Law, Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Munich.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58 · 2015\nFinally, private actors play an important role. This means, on the one side, that issues of State responsibility for private activities have to be addressed, and on the other, that human rights issues must be taken into account. All of this does not fit easily into the inter-State paradigm of mutual obligations between States. The following considerations thus necessarily are of a preliminary, explorative character.\n## II. General Assumptions\n## A. Concerning the Role of States\nA first general assumption relates to the role of States in regulating the internet. In contrast to some positions in literature, in the following the internet is not viewed as a legal space which is distinct from the territory of States and thus subject to its own, independent legal regime. The internet certainly has an important transnational dimension, but that does not mean that it is intrinsically transnational and cannot be made subject to regulations from individual States. Rather, the following considerations are based on a territorial approach according to which ‘the Internet’ is viewed as being – at least in most parts – covered by the authority of the State on whose territory a specific activity in question takes place, i.e. where a person physically conducts his or her malicious activity or where a server or computer on which the activity takes place is located.\nSpecific problems may arise in the context of data which move frequently between different servers and different locations. Given the frequency and rapidity with which the location of data may be changed, the situation of such data has been described as a “loss of location”. However, these specific problems of ‘data in the cloud(s)’ may\n Eneken Tikk, Ten Rules for Cyber Security, Survival: Global Politics and Strategy 53 (2011), 119, 121; Johann-Christoph Woltag, Computer Network Operations Below the Level of Armed Force, European Society of International Law (ESIL) Conference Paper No. 1/2011, 12, available via: http://www.esil-sedi.eu/node/697 (accessed on 31 October 2015); Benedikt Pirker, Territorial Integrity and the Challenges of Cyberspace, in: Katharina Ziolkowski (ed.), Peacetime Regime for State Activities in Cyberspace (2013), 189, 193 et seq. For a similar approach see Art. 22 (1)(a)–(c) Convention on Cybercrime, 23 November 2001, ETS No. 185 (Budapest Convention); specific problems of activities in internationalised territories such as the high seas are left aside, given their presumably small practical relevance.\n Council of Europe, Economic Crime Division, Cloud Computing and Cybercrime Investigations: Territoriality vs. the Power of Disposal?, Discussion Paper, 31 August 2010, available at: rm.coe.int/\nOBLIGATIONS OF STATES 69\nrequire specific methods of inquiry and access, but they do not change the fundamental principle of territoriality.\n## B. Concerning the Term ‘Cyber Security Incident’\nThe term ‘cyber security incident’ is vague. It competes with other notions such as ‘cyber warfare’, ‘cyber terrorism’, ‘cyber conflict’, ‘cyber threat’, ‘cyber crime’, or ‘cyber attack’. Some of these terms go along with certain strategies to ensure cyber security: ‘Cyber crime’ suggests a criminal law approach, ‘cyber warfare’ obviously alludes to use of force and international humanitarian law, etc.\n‘Cyber security incident’ may cover incidents as different as the distributed denial of service attack (DDoS) on the Estonian public computer system in 2007, the Stuxnet worm, which was apparently specifically designed for halting the Iranian nuclear programme, the hacking of computer systems of private companies for the purpose of industrial espionage and other cases of internet torts, hacktivist actions for the promotion of political ideas, etc. One could even include the military dimension under the label of ‘cyber security incident’. However, given that most malicious cyber activity does not reach the level of armed force, only incidents remaining below\nCoERM Public Common Search Services / Display DCTM Content? document Id=09000016802fa3df (accessed on 31 October 2015); see also Cybercrime Convention Committee (T-CY), (Draft) Elements of an Additional Protocol to the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime regarding transborder access to data, 9 April 2013, T-CY (2013)14, available at: https://www.coe.int/t/dghl/cooperation/economic crime/Source/Cybercrime/TCY/TCY%202013/T-CY%282013%2914transb_elements_protocol_V2.pdf (accessed on 11 November 2015).\n See, for an attempt to clarify the relationship of several competing notions, Oona A.

In order to further clarify the notion of ‘cyber security incident’, it is helpful to look at the Convention on Cybercrime (Budapest Convention).\n## C. The CoE Convention on Cybercrime (Budapest Convention)\nA few words concerning the Budapest Convention are in place by way of introduction: The Convention is the most comprehensive binding international document relating to cyber security. Currently the Budapest Convention has 47 parties, among them several States who are not members of the Council of Europe (USA, Japan, Australia, and the Dominican Republic). There are further non-European signatories which have not yet ratified the Convention (Canada and South Africa). The Convention follows a criminal law approach and seeks to harmonise national laws by defining certain computer-related offences and setting minimum standards for the methods of their investigation and concerning the cooperation between States.\nThe definition covers offences against the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of computer-related data and systems (Articles 2–6 Budapest Convention), computer-related offences (forgery and fraud, Articles 7 and 8 Budapest Convention), content-related offences (child pornography, Article 9 Budapest Convention), and finally offences relating to infringements of copyright and related rights (Article 10 Budapest Convention).\n Charter of the United Nations, 26 June 1945, UNCIO 15, 335 (UN Charter).\n See supra, note 1. For a recent account of the Convention see Sophie Kwasny, Lutte contre la cybercriminalité et respect des droits de l'homme: Les instruments du Conseil de l'Europe, in: Société Française Pour le Droit International (ed.), Internet et le droit international: Colloque de Rouen (2014), 339.\n See e.g. Paul Rosenzweig, International Law and Private Actor Active Cyber Defensive Measures, Stanford Journal of International Law 50 (2014), 103, 108; Hathaway et al. (note 3), 862.\n For an analysis see Michael A. Vatis, The Council of Europe Convention on Cyber Crime, in: National Research Council (ed.), Proceedings of a Workshop on Deterring Cyber-Attacks: Informing Strategies and Developing Options for U.S. Policy (2010), 207; Robert Uerpmann-Wittzack, Internet-völkerrecht, Archiv des Völkerrechts 47 (2009), 261, 269–270.\nOBLIGATIONS OF STATES 71\nDue to its criminal law approach, the Budapest Convention includes issues which are not related to inter-State security or to obligations incumbent upon States to ensure that their territories are not used for purposes which are harmful to other States. A more limited approach is therefore warranted for the purposes of this contribution. Accordingly, I propose to limit the notion of ‘cyber security incident’ to those crimes which relate to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of computer data and systems. A cyber security incident thus occurs whenever computers or computer systems are illegally accessed or destroyed or when data are illegally intercepted, deleted, or altered.\n## III. General Obligations of Prevention\nThe first phase of possible obligations relates to the situation prior to a cyber security incident. In this phase obligations of prevention are of interest. These aspects will be dealt with first (III.). In a second step obligations of cooperation and information will be dealt with (IV.). These obligations are mostly relevant during or after a cyber security incident has occurred.\n## A. Principle of Non-Intervention\nThe most fundamental principle applicable is the principle of non-intervention. According to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) it is “part and parcel of customary international law”. When a State uses the internet in order to destabilise another country, this constitutes a violation of the principle of non-intervention. Similarly, cyber-based activities of organs of one State on computers situated in another country or relating to parts of the web situated in another country would infringe upon the latter country’s sovereignty.\nIn this area, issues such as attribution, standards of proof, etc. are more important than the substantive law, which is quite clear. In that regard, it is necessary to distinguish between computers and computer systems belonging to the government and\n International Court of Justice (ICJ), *Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua* (Nicaragua v. United States of America), Merits, Judgment of 27 June 1986, ICJ Reports 1986, para. 202.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58 · 2015\ncomputers and computer systems owned and operated by private individuals or companies. Computers belonging to the government may be presumed to be controlled by the government. Ideas for distributing responsibility under such circumstances may be borrowed from the jurisprudence and practice of human rights bodies regarding persons who are in complete control of State agents.\nThe European Court of Human Rights, for instance, argues as follows:\nWhere the events in issue lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of persons within their control in custody, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries and death occurring during such detention. Indeed, the burden of proof may be regarded as resting on the authorities to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation.^[14]^\nThe factor of exclusive control was also taken into consideration by the ICJ in developing its standard of proof in the Corfu Channel case:\n[...] the fact of this exclusive territorial control exercised by a State within its frontiers has a bearing upon the methods of proof available to establish the knowledge of that State as to such events. By reason of this exclusive control, the other State, the victim of a breach of international law, is often unable to furnish direct proof of facts giving rise to responsibility. Such a State should be allowed a more liberal recourse to inferences of fact and circumstantial evidence. This indirect evidence is admitted in all systems of law, and its use is recognized by international decisions. It must be regarded as of special weight when it is based on a series of facts linked together and leading logically to a single conclusion.^[15]^\nActivities on computers owned by the government are “within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities.” Hence, the following assumption may be made: Where a malicious cyber activity creating a cyber security incident can be traced back to a government computer or computer system, the activity may be attributed to the government, unless it provides a satisfactory and convincing explanation that the system was externally used (i.e. has been hacked by someone else).^[16]^\n^[14] European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR), Salman v.

Hence, it is necessary to establish that the activity in question was executed “on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct.” Usually it will be impossible to meet this standard. It is therefore necessary to ask whether there are further obligations of control or prevention which include activities of private actors.\n## B. No-Harm Principle\nIn the *Corfu Channel* case the ICJ assumed a general duty to prevent harm. The Court ruled on a general principle to prevent harm as one of the bases for an Albanian duty to warn the British government: “[...] every State’s obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States.”\nThe general principle has been developed in more detail in the area of international environmental law where good neighbourliness and a duty to prevent harm are considered to be part of customary law. The main sources for this principle are the famous *Trail Smelter* arbitration and Principle 21 Stockholm Declaration/Principle 2 Rio Declaration.\n---\n International Law Commission (ILC), Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, GAOR, 56th Sess., Suppl. 10, 43 et seq.\n Cf. also Terry D. Gill, *Non-Intervention in the Cyber Context*, in: Ziolkowski (ed.)

(note 7).\n The Stockholm Declaration’s wording: “States have, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and the principles of international law, the sovereign right to exploit their own resources pursuant to their own environmental policies, and the responsibility to ensure that activities within their jurisdiction or control do not cause damage to the environment of other States or of areas beyond the limits of national jurisdiction”, Stockholm Declaration of the United Nations Conference\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58 · 2015\nThese principles allow for the inclusion of harm caused by private actors. In the *Corfu Channel* case mere knowledge by the Albanian authorities of the danger was sufficient, and in the *Trail Smelter* case the pollution emanated from a private plant. Thus, the principles of good neighbourliness and the duty to prevent harm extend the responsibility of States for private action beyond the strict criteria of Article 8 Articles on State Responsibility. To put the issue more generally: Responsibility of States for private action is not only caused by criteria of attribution, i.e. within the law of State responsibility, but also by the character of the primary obligations of States. Obligations of control and surveillance entail an indirect responsibility for private action if they are not respected. This reflects that there is an interaction in the law of State responsibility between the issue of attribution on the one side and the scope of the obligation of the State on the other. In terms of the practical outcome, obligations of surveillance and control may thus constitute a substitute for the attribution of private action to a State.\nThe consequences which flow from the overall responsibility of States for harmful activities on their territory are, however, mitigated to some extent by additional criteria.\nFirst, the *Corfu Channel* formula requires “knowledge” on part of the State concerned. While the ICJ could operate with certain assumptions regarding the overall control of the territorial waters, such an overall control certainly cannot be assumed with respect to any cyber activity on the territory of a given State. Hence, the requirement of “knowledge” of the harmful activity will only be met in rare cases.\non the Human Environment, UN Doc.

Drumbl*, Trail Smelter and the International Law Commission’s Work on State Responsibility for Internationally Wrongful Acts and State Liability, in: Bratspies/Miller (eds.) (note 7), 86 et seq.\n ICJ, *Corfu Channel* (note 15), 18 et seq.\n Cf. *Pirker* (note 1), 204 et seq., also discussing some alternative conceptions.\nOBLIGATIONS OF STATES 75\nSecondly, the Trail Smelter principle has originally been restricted in its scope by the requirement of “serious consequence” being established by “clear and convincing evidence”. It does not seem to be excluded, however, that these criteria are met in the context of cyber security incidents. For example, it has been argued that the DDoS attack on Estonia in 2007 constituted a case of “serious consequence”. Irrespective of that it is today mostly recognised that international environmental law has developed beyond the Trail Smelter requirements. Thus, the no-harm rule as it currently stands in customary international law only requires a certain *de minimis* threshold to be fulfilled and the precautionary principle may be considered to have alleviated the strict Trail Smelter standard of proof.\nFinally, the Trail Smelter principle is further mitigated by the requirement of due diligence. Today “there is a clear consensus that although the no-harm principle does not say so explicitly, a State can only breach the principle if it fails to act with due diligence.” According to the ILC in its Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities (Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm) both the magnitude and the probability of harm are to be taken\n For further elaboration on this see Russell A.

Further minimum requirements are foreseeability for the State concerned and respect of the best scientific knowledge.\nIf these due diligence requirements are taken into consideration, it must be questioned whether one can expect a significant contribution of the no-harm rule to the prevention of cyber security incidents. While it may be worthwhile to explore the technological possibilities of prevention to some extent, it cannot be overlooked that a preventive surveillance of all cyber activities neither seems to be a technical possibility nor would it meet human rights standards of freedom of expression and communication. Hence, preventive action by States is both factually and legally considerably limited.\n## C. Precautionary Principle\nA similar scepticism relates to the precautionary principle, which would be the most obvious candidate for imposing preventive action. Indeed, the precautionary\n See the commentary to Art. 3 Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm, para. 11: “The standard of due diligence against which the conduct of the State of origin should be examined is that which is generally considered to be appropriate and proportional to the degree of risk of transboundary harm in the particular instance. For example, activities which may be considered ultrahazardous require a much higher standard of care in designing policies and a much higher degree of vigour on the part of the State to enforce them. Issues such as the size of the operation; its location, special climate conditions, materials used in the activity, and whether the conclusions drawn from the application of these factors in a specific case are reasonable, are among the factors to be considered in determining the due diligence requirement in each instance. What would be considered a reasonable standard of care or due diligence may change with time; what might be considered an appropriate and reasonable procedure, standard or rule at one point in time may not be considered as such at some point in the future. Hence, due diligence in ensuring safety requires a State to keep abreast of technological changes and scientific developments” (II.C, Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities, with Commentaries (2001), Report on the Work of its 53rd Session, UN Doc. A/56/10 (2001), 377); see also the definition of “risk of causing significant transboundary harm” in Art. 2 Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm: “The definition refers to two types of activities under these articles. One is where there is a low probability of causing disastrous harm. This is normally the characteristic of ultrahazardous activities. The other one is where there is a high probability of causing significant harm. This includes activities which have a high probability of causing harm which, while not disastrous, is still significant. But it would exclude activities where there is a very low probability of causing significant transboundary harm.” (ibid., commentary para. 3).\n Beyerlin/Marauhn (note 32), 43.\n For a discussion of the due diligence standard’s applicability in cyberspace regulation (with reference to the ‘duty of prevention’) see also Pirker (note 1), 206–209.\nOBLIGATIONS OF STATES 77\nprinciple has assumed a prominent place in modern international law. Although its legal basis in customary law is still being questioned, there are clear indications to the contrary, notably regarding environmental impact assessments. The requirement to undertake an environmental impact assessment has been considered to be rooted in customary international law by several international decisions. The most prominent among them is the *Pulp Mills* case of the ICJ where the Court held that\n[...] it may now be considered a requirement under general international law to undertake an environmental impact assessment where there is a risk that the proposed industrial activity may have a significant adverse impact in a transboundary context [...].\nSimilar approaches were taken by arbitral tribunals in the *Iron Rhine Arbitration* and the *Indus Waters Project*. It may therefore be assumed that at least in form of an environmental impact assessment the precautionary principle has entered general international law.\n Jonathan B. Wiener, *Precaution*, in: Daniel Bodansky/Jutta Brunnée/Ellen Hey (eds.), Oxford Handbook on International Environmental Law (2007), 597, 599.\n See *Thilo Marauhn*, *Customary Rules of International Environmental Law: Can they Provide Guidance for Developing a Peacetime Regime for Cyberspace?*, in: *Ziolkowski* (ed.) (note 1), 465, 474–476, taking a critical stance on the precautionary principle’s prospects for application in cyber contexts.\n ICJ, *Case Concerning Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay* (Argentina v. Uruguay), Judgment of 20 April 2010, ICJ Reports 2010, 14, para. 204.\n *Arbitration Regarding the Iron Rhine (‘Ijzeren Rijn’) Railway* (Belgium, The Netherlands), Arbitral Award of 24 May 2005, RIAA XXVII, para. 59: “Environmental law and the law on development stand not as alternatives but as mutually reinforcing, integral concepts, which require that where development may cause significant harm to the environment there is a duty to prevent, or at least mitigate, such harm (see paragraph 222). This duty, in the opinion of the Tribunal, has now become a principle of general international law”.\n *The Indus Waters Kishenganga Arbitration* (Pakistan, India), Partial Award of 18 February 2013, paras. 449 et seq., available at: http://www.pca-cpa.org/PK-IN%2020130218%20Partial%20Award%2018ba.pdf?fil_id=2101 (accessed on 11 November 2015): “There is no doubt that States are required under contemporary customary international law to take environmental protection into consideration when planning and developing projects that may cause injury to a bordering State. Since the time of Trail Smelter, a series of international conventions, declarations and judicial and arbitral decisions have addressed the need to manage natural resources in a sustainable manner. In particular, the International Court of Justice expounded upon the principle of ‘sustainable development’ in *Gabcikovo-Nagymaros*, referring to the ‘need to reconcile economic development with protection of the environment.’ Applied to large-scale construction projects, the principle of sustainable development translates, as the International Court of Justice recently put it in *Pulp Mills*, into ‘a requirement under general international law to undertake an environmental impact assessment where there is a risk that the proposed industrial activity may have a significant adverse impact in a transboundary context, in particular, on a shared resource’” (footnotes omitted).\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\nCould one transfer the concept into the cyber world in form of a ‘cyber impact assessment’ requirement? There are strong arguments against such a transposition. A starting point is that the environmental impact assessment relates to large industrial projects, which are considered to go along with specific risks for the environment. The possible sources of cyber security incidents cannot be narrowed down according to the scale of the activity. Each and every single computer, notebook, tablet, or smartphone could be the source of a cyber security incident. Hence, preventive cyber impact assessment would practically have to cover all activities in the internet. This would be incompatible with requirements of freedom of expression and communication and thus certainly go beyond what could be seen as part of general international law.\n## D. Summary Regarding Prevention\nIn sum, the preventive obligations of States in the absence of concrete cyber security incidents remain rather limited. It is impossible to postulate a general obligation to preventively monitor cyber activities which are linked to the territory of a given State. Therefore, preventive obligations are basically limited to a prohibition to actively engage in malicious cyber activity and to respect due diligence standards regarding computers and systems which are under the control of the State.\n## IV. Procedural Obligations of Cooperation and Information (During and After a Cyber Security Incident)\nDoes that situation change during or after a cyber security incident?\n## A. Good Neighbourliness as a General Source\nThis article has already referred to the principle of good neighbourliness as a general source of cooperation and information. Indeed, Article 74 UN Charter codi\n On the transferability of international environmental law rules to cyberspace activities see generally Marauhn (note 38), 481–482.\nOBLIGATIONS OF STATES 79\nfies the principle of good neighbourliness regarding all matters of social, economic, and commercial matters. Based on the ICJ’s decision in the *Haya de la Torre* case, the legal character of the principle of good neighbourliness is sometimes questioned. The better view, however, rests its analysis on the frequent reference to the principle in many international treaties and concludes on a ‘hard-law content’ of the principle. Irrespective of its hard law content, two problems remain when the concept of good neighbourliness is to be applied in the context of cyber security. The first relates to geographic proximity and the second to concrete obligations to be derived from the concept.\nUsually a certain geographic proximity of the States is required when the principle of good neighbourliness is invoked. It should be noted, however, that the United Nations General Assembly, already in 1991 and outside the context of the world wide web, extended the notion of good neighbourliness to all States of the international community “whether or not they are contiguous”. Even if this approach is considered too far-reaching in the general context of all inter-State relations, a good point for universal neighbourliness may be made as far as relations through the internet are concerned. Effects of cyber activities are not limited to adjacent States but can be produced anywhere. Therefore, looked at from the perspective of its purpose, *i.e.* the obligations to duly take into account possible adverse effects on a neighbouring country, transferring the principle of good neighbourliness to the world wide web leads to its application in all inter-State relations, irrespective of the geographical location of the States concerned.\nAs far as concrete obligations under the principle of good neighbourliness are concerned, it is again international environmental law which provides for the best comparison. The most broadly accepted obligation concerns an obligation of information in case of emergency. Apart from that, there exist also general obligations of information, consultation, and notification in the absence of emergency situations.\n ICJ, *Haya de la Torre* (Colombia *v.* Peru), Judgment of 13 June 1951, ICJ Reports 1951, 71.\n See e.g. *Leland M. Goodrich/Edvard Hambro/Anne Patricia Simons*, Charter of the United Nations: Commentary and Documents (3rd ed. 1969), 463.\n *Laurence Boisson de Chazournes/Danio Campanelli*, Neighbour States, MPEPIL, December 2006, para. 20, available *via*: http://www.mpepil.com (accessed on 8 June 2015); *Ulrich Fastenrath*, Article 74, in: Bruno Simma *et al.* (eds.), UN Charter Commentary (3rd ed. 2012), 1840, MN 2.\n GA Res. 46/92 of 9 December 1991.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\n## B. Emergency Information\nThere is a clear customary duty to inform in cases of emergency. Evidence of this duty is – again – the Corfu Channel case where the ICJ considered Albania under an obligation to warn the British warship of the mines, similar obligations of warning are contained in a number of treaties relating to the environment. One may also point to duties of information concerning infections “in the real world”. Article 6 World Health Organization (WHO) International Health Regulations requires States to\nnotify WHO, by the most efficient means of communication available, by way of the National IHR [International Health Regulations] Focal Point, and within 24 hours of assessment of public health information, of all events which may constitute a public health emergency of international concern within its territory [...] as well as any health measure implemented in response to those events.\nThus, in order to effectively combat their negative effects, virtual and real viruses may be treated alike.\nGiven the rapid connections via the internet, this information duty in cases of emergency may seem of limited value. On the other hand, one of the last epidemic attacks, the so-called conficker worm which primarily attacked Microsoft Windows operating systems, lasted over a period from 2008 to 2010, infecting among other institutions the German Bundeswehr, the French Navy, and the Greater Manchester Police. During such a prolonged period, warning not only by the public concerned but also by States may help limiting the consequences.\n## C. Information, Consultation, and Notification Beyond Emergency Situations\nObligations from the principle of good neighbourliness which relate to activities involving a risk of harm are not limited to the ex ante situation, i.e. before the activity\n For detailed references see *Birnie/Boyle/Redgwell* (note 20), 182 et seq.\n Cf. Arts. 6 and 7 WHO International Health Regulations (2nd ed. 2005), WHA Doc. WHA 58.3, available at: http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2008/9789241580410_eng.pdf (accessed on 8 June 2015).

Davies*, Is There an International Duty to Protect Persons in the Event of an Epidemic?, Global Health Governance (2010), available via: http://www.ghgj.org (accessed on 8 June 2015).\n For more information on this worm see e.g. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conficker (accessed on 11 November 2015).\nOBLIGATIONS OF STATES 81\nis started. This is explicitly spelled out in the ILC Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm. Article 12 Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm contains a continuous obligation to exchange information. It would seem strange indeed if the obligations concerning information and consultation concerning environmental protection were to end once the project has started. Seen from this perspective, the continued duty to consult and inform once a project has started is basically a prolongation of the precautionary approach which creates obligations of prevention.\nAgainst this background one might be tempted to assume that – when transposed to the issue of cyber security incidents – a continued duty to consult and to inform encounters the same problems which have been highlighted concerning preventive action. However, there is an important factual difference which leads to a different analysis: At the preventive stage, *i.e.* prior to a concrete cyber security incident, it is not possible to limit the obligations to specific activities which may be considered particularly dangerous. By contrast, during or after a cyber security incident it is not unlikely that the State or States where the incident occurred or caused harmful consequences are able to narrow down possible sources and to give information on them. Under such circumstances the duty to provide information and to consult acquires a new and sufficiently specific content. Instead of being related to potentially all activities in the world wide web emanating from a specific country, the duty relates to activities which have proved harmful and thus present characteristics which allow them to be distinguished from other harmless activities. Under such circumstances it seems appropriate to assume a duty of cooperation on the part of the State where the activity allegedly emanated from and to oblige this State to share any information on the matter which is available to its authorities. In other words: While under the principle of good neighbourliness in the real world the size of a certain activity and the risks attached to it trigger general obligations of cooperation, in the cyber world it is the occurrence of a specific cyber security incident which triggers specific obligations of cooperation.\n See *supra*, note 34.\n “While the activity is being carried out, the States concerned shall exchange in a timely manner all available information concerning that activity relevant to preventing significant transboundary harm or at any event minimizing the risk thereof. Such an exchange of information shall continue until such time as the States concerned consider it appropriate even after the activity is terminated”.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58 · 2015\nIn this context the question arises whether a certain standard of probability must be shown by the requesting State. The standard is not easy to circumscribe. It is certainly not enough if the source of the malicious activity is merely asserted. On the other hand, demanding full proof would most probably be a standard which is difficult to meet. While it is true that the ICJ in the *Oil Platforms* case demanded full proof by the United States (US) that the missile attack against their vessels constituted an armed attack by Iran on the US, which claimed to have reacted in self-defence, there is a decisive difference in the situation addressed here: The *Oil Platforms* case was about the justification of an otherwise unlawful use of force against another State. In the current context obligations of investigation and information are at issue. In other words: We are not talking about the legality of cross-border activity by one State against another, but about obligations of a State arising out of a specific situation over which it has at least territorial control. On the basis of the *Corfu Channel* case the standard of proof is lower:\nBy reason of this exclusive control, the other State, the victim of a breach of international law, is often unable to furnish direct proof of facts giving rise to responsibility. Such a State should be allowed a more liberal recourse to inferences of fact and circumstantial evidence. This indirect evidence is admitted in all systems of law, and its use is recognized by international decisions. It must be regarded as of special weight when it is based on a series of facts linked together and leading logically to a single conclusion.\n## D. Cooperation in Investigation and Prosecution\nAnother issue concerns obligations of investigation and prosecution. In order to be clear on the previous point of information and cooperation: The obligation to share information can only relate to information which is already available to the authorities. A certainly more far-reaching obligation would concern investigation and collection of information which is *not yet available*. It is to this point that I now want to turn.\n ICJ, *Case Concerning Oil Platforms* (Islamic Republic of Iran v. United States of America), Judgment of 6 November 2003, ICJ Reports 2003, 161, paras. 57 et seq.\n See *id.*, *Corfu Channel* (note 15), 18.\nOBLIGATIONS OF STATES 83\n## 1. The General Framework for International Criminal Cooperation\nUnder the general framework for international criminal cooperation there are only very limited generally applicable rules. Although the field is moving fast towards closer cooperation, in the absence of specific treaty provisions mutual assistance in international criminal law is still dominated by traditional views on sovereignty which give the requested State broad discretion in whether at all, and if so under which conditions, it will meet a request for assistance.\nThe main tools which exist within the framework of international criminal cooperation concern requests for extradition and mutual assistance in other matters of criminal investigation, such as witnesses, evidence, etc. Regarding both institutions there are no general, but only specific obligations concerning either certain crimes (i.e. the application of the *aut dedere aut iudicare* principle to acts of terrorism) or the respective obligations are contained in specific treaties on mutual cooperation in criminal matters.\n## 2. Obligations Contained in the Budapest Convention\nThe most elaborate treaty relating to international criminal cooperation concerning crimes related to cyberspace is, again, the Budapest Convention. Apart from defining cyber crime offences, the Convention requires its parties to enact certain investigative procedures for the inquiry into cyber crimes: expedited preservation of stored computer data (Article 16 Budapest Convention), preservation and disclosure of traffic data (Article 17 Budapest Convention), search and seizure of stored computer data (Article 19 Budapest Convention), real-time collection of traffic data (Article 20 Budapest Convention), and, finally, the interception of content data (Article 21 Budapest Convention).\nIn its third part the Convention deals with international cooperation in the areas of extradition, mutual assistance, and establishment of permanent points of contact (Articles 23–35 Budapest Convention). These provisions explicitly take up obliga-\n *Tim René Salomon*, Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters, MPEPIL, January 2013, paras. 36 *et seq.*, available via: http://www.mpepil.com (accessed on 8 June 2015).\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\ntions which are contained in general treaties on extradition or mutual assistance and extend existing general obligations to cyber crimes as defined under the Budapest Convention (Article 24 (2) Budapest Convention and, with certain limits, Article 25 (4) Budapest Convention concerning mutual assistance).\nAccording to the working definition of cyber security incidents given above, every cyber security incident automatically constitutes a cyber crime under the Convention. Hence the procedural obligations of the Convention apply as far as States parties of the Budapest Convention are concerned. Given the fact that the focus of this analysis rests on general international law, the obligations under the Budapest Convention will, however, not be looked into in more detail.\n## 3. Transposing Obligations of Investigation Developed in International Human Rights Adjudication\nAnother area of inspiration for obligations to investigate may be found in the jurisprudence of international human rights bodies relating to positive obligations of States in case of human rights violations. There is a clear and – it seems – widely accepted obligation to investigate in two groups of cases. The first has already been dealt with in the context of a reversal of the burden of proof, namely situations of complete control by the State (i.e. prisons and other institutions for detaining persons). On the basis of this jurisprudence it may be argued that an obligation to investigate arises where malicious cyber activity can be traced back to a computer or computer system controlled by another State. At first sight one might object that the situations of an individual human rights claim on the one side and inter-State obligations on the other are not compatible. There is, however, a common denominator which is the exclusive control of the State. In that regard, the two situations do not differ decisively. Hence, obligations of investigation may be assumed concerning computers and computer systems under the control of the government.\n## 4. Transborder Access to Data\nThe issue of transborder access to data has gained a lot of public attention in recent days. The Budapest Convention left the issue deliberately open. Article 32 Budapest\nOBLIGATIONS OF STATES\nConvention only regulates the easy cases of data which is publicly available (lit. a) and consent by the person who has the lawful authority to disclose the data (lit. b). One might be tempted to conclude that the express regulation of only these two instances *e contrario* precludes any other transborder access to data. However, the explanatory report excludes this argument by referring to Article 39 Budapest Convention according to which other obligations are neither created nor precluded.\nThe issue of transborder access to data is currently being discussed in the context of a possible Additional Protocol to the Budapest Convention. If my reading of the papers which are publicly available is correct, there are a number of different proposals on the table. Discussing them would probably require a paper on its own.\nFor that reason I do not want to go into details of transborder access to data. I will limit my comments on this issue to one single point: If the analysis above is correct that under certain circumstances obligations of information and even of investigation may arise out of specific cyber security incidents, the argument may be made that transborder access to data may be justified as a countermeasure if a State does not meet its obligations of investigation (and the other conditions for lawful countermeasures are met).\n## V. Overall Assessment\nTo conclude, the legal obligations of States before, during, and after a cyber security incident can be summarised in two final points:\n1. All States are cyber neighbours. Therefore, in general international law the principle of good neighbourliness is the most promising candidate for developing obligations of cooperation and assistance in dealing with malicious cyber activities. The most important challenge consists in the fact that it is impossible to distin\n Council of Europe, Explanatory Report to the Convention on Cybercrime, para. 293, available at: https://rm.coe.int/CoERMPublicCommonSearchServices/DisplayDCTMContent?documentId=09000016800ce5b (accessed on 6 November 2015).

As a consequence of this specific characteristic of cyber activities the focus must be laid on obligations of cooperation during and after a cyber security incident, rather than at the preventive stage."

On the basis of this assumption, the author inquires into possible principles and rules established in general international law which could be relied on in order to address cyber security incidents, i.e. inter-State conflicts relating to cyberspace which remain below the threshold of the notions of use of force or armed conflict.\nRelying mainly on principles established in international environmental law, it is argued that the principle of good neighbourliness is the most promising candidate for developing obligations of cooperation and assistance in dealing with malicious cyber activities. However, one crucial difference between hazardous activities relating to the environment and threats in cyberspace is spelled out: In contrast to activities with potential dangers for the environment, with regard to the internet it is impossible to distinguish 'hazardous' activities from non-hazardous activities. For this reason it is impossible to establish thresholds or activities in cyberspace which could serve as triggers for preventive obligations. As a consequence, the focus must be laid on obligations of cooperation and assistance during and after a cyber security incident, rather than at the preventive stage.\nKEYWORDS: Cyber Security, Good Neighbourliness, Corfu Channel Case, Burden of Proof, Prevention, Obligations of Cooperation\n## I. Introduction\nThe internet presents many challenges to international law. Its virtual character is considered to put into question the principle of territoriality which in many areas is fundamental to international law as it currently stands. The rapidity of cyber activity requires swift and often coordinated if not collective action by more than one State.\n* Professor for Public and Public International Law, Institute for International Law, Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Munich.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58 · 2015\nFinally, private actors play an important role. This means, on the one side, that issues of State responsibility for private activities have to be addressed, and on the other, that human rights issues must be taken into account. All of this does not fit easily into the inter-State paradigm of mutual obligations between States. The following considerations thus necessarily are of a preliminary, explorative character.\n## II. General Assumptions\n## A. Concerning the Role of States\nA first general assumption relates to the role of States in regulating the internet. In contrast to some positions in literature, in the following the internet is not viewed as a legal space which is distinct from the territory of States and thus subject to its own, independent legal regime. The internet certainly has an important transnational dimension, but that does not mean that it is intrinsically transnational and cannot be made subject to regulations from individual States. Rather, the following considerations are based on a territorial approach according to which ‘the Internet’ is viewed as being – at least in most parts – covered by the authority of the State on whose territory a specific activity in question takes place, i.e. where a person physically conducts his or her malicious activity or where a server or computer on which the activity takes place is located.¹\nSpecific problems may arise in the context of data which move frequently between different servers and different locations. Given the frequency and rapidity with which the location of data may be changed, the situation of such data has been described as a “loss of location”.² However, these specific problems of ‘data in the cloud(s)’ may\n¹ Eneken Tikk, Ten Rules for Cyber Security, Survival: Global Politics and Strategy 53 (2011), 119, 121; Johann-Christoph Woltag, Computer Network Operations Below the Level of Armed Force, European Society of International Law (ESIL) Conference Paper No. 1/2011, 12, available via: http://www.esil-sedi.eu/node/697 (accessed on 31 October 2015); Benedikt Pirker, Territorial Integrity and the Challenges of Cyberspace, in: Katharina Ziolkowski (ed.), Peacetime Regime for State Activities in Cyberspace (2013), 189, 193 et seq. For a similar approach see Art. 22 (1)(a)–(c) Convention on Cybercrime, 23 November 2001, ETS No. 185 (Budapest Convention); specific problems of activities in internationalised territories such as the high seas are left aside, given their presumably small practical relevance.\n² Council of Europe, Economic Crime Division, Cloud Computing and Cybercrime Investigations: Territoriality vs. the Power of Disposal?, Discussion Paper, 31 August 2010, available at: rm.coe.int/\nOBLIGATIONS OF STATES 69\nrequire specific methods of inquiry and access, but they do not change the fundamental principle of territoriality.\n## B. Concerning the Term ‘Cyber Security Incident’\nThe term ‘cyber security incident’ is vague. It competes with other notions such as ‘cyber warfare’, ‘cyber terrorism’, ‘cyber conflict’, ‘cyber threat’, ‘cyber crime’, or ‘cyber attack’.³ Some of these terms go along with certain strategies to ensure cyber security:⁴ ‘Cyber crime’ suggests a criminal law approach, ‘cyber warfare’ obviously alludes to use of force and international humanitarian law, etc.\n‘Cyber security incident’ may cover incidents as different as the distributed denial of service attack (DDoS) on the Estonian public computer system in 2007,⁵ the Stuxnet worm, which was apparently specifically designed for halting the Iranian nuclear programme,⁶ the hacking of computer systems of private companies for the purpose of industrial espionage and other cases of internet torts,⁷ hacktivist actions for the promotion of political ideas,⁸ etc. One could even include the military dimension under the label of ‘cyber security incident’. However, given that most malicious cyber activity does not reach the level of armed force, only incidents remaining below\nCoERM Public Common Search Services / Display DCTM Content? document Id=09000016802fa3df (accessed on 31 October 2015); see also Cybercrime Convention Committee (T-CY), (Draft) Elements of an Additional Protocol to the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime regarding transborder access to data, 9 April 2013, T-CY (2013)14, available at: https://www.coe.int/t/dghl/cooperation/economic crime/Source/Cybercrime/TCY/TCY%202013/T-CY%282013%2914transb_elements_protocol_V2.pdf (accessed on 11 November 2015).\n³ See, for an attempt to clarify the relationship of several competing notions, Oona A.

In order to further clarify the notion of ‘cyber security incident’, it is helpful to look at the Convention on Cybercrime (Budapest Convention).¹⁰\n## C. The CoE Convention on Cybercrime (Budapest Convention)\nA few words concerning the Budapest Convention are in place by way of introduction: The Convention is the most comprehensive binding international document relating to cyber security.¹¹ Currently the Budapest Convention has 47 parties, among them several States who are not members of the Council of Europe (USA, Japan, Australia, and the Dominican Republic). There are further non-European signatories which have not yet ratified the Convention (Canada and South Africa). The Convention follows a criminal law approach and seeks to harmonise national laws by defining certain computer-related offences and setting minimum standards for the methods of their investigation and concerning the cooperation between States.¹²\nThe definition covers offences against the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of computer-related data and systems (Articles 2–6 Budapest Convention), computer-related offences (forgery and fraud, Articles 7 and 8 Budapest Convention), content-related offences (child pornography, Article 9 Budapest Convention), and finally offences relating to infringements of copyright and related rights (Article 10 Budapest Convention).\n⁹ Charter of the United Nations, 26 June 1945, UNCIO 15, 335 (UN Charter).\n¹⁰ See supra, note 1. For a recent account of the Convention see Sophie Kwasny, Lutte contre la cybercriminalité et respect des droits de l'homme: Les instruments du Conseil de l'Europe, in: Société Française Pour le Droit International (ed.), Internet et le droit international: Colloque de Rouen (2014), 339.\n¹¹ See e.g. Paul Rosenzweig, International Law and Private Actor Active Cyber Defensive Measures, Stanford Journal of International Law 50 (2014), 103, 108; Hathaway et al. (note 3), 862.\n¹² For an analysis see Michael A. Vatis, The Council of Europe Convention on Cyber Crime, in: National Research Council (ed.), Proceedings of a Workshop on Deterring Cyber-Attacks: Informing Strategies and Developing Options for U.S. Policy (2010), 207; Robert Uerpmann-Wittzack, Internet-völkerrecht, Archiv des Völkerrechts 47 (2009), 261, 269–270.\nOBLIGATIONS OF STATES 71\nDue to its criminal law approach, the Budapest Convention includes issues which are not related to inter-State security or to obligations incumbent upon States to ensure that their territories are not used for purposes which are harmful to other States. A more limited approach is therefore warranted for the purposes of this contribution. Accordingly, I propose to limit the notion of ‘cyber security incident’ to those crimes which relate to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of computer data and systems. A cyber security incident thus occurs whenever computers or computer systems are illegally accessed or destroyed or when data are illegally intercepted, deleted, or altered.\n## III. General Obligations of Prevention\nThe first phase of possible obligations relates to the situation prior to a cyber security incident. In this phase obligations of prevention are of interest. These aspects will be dealt with first (III.). In a second step obligations of cooperation and information will be dealt with (IV.). These obligations are mostly relevant during or after a cyber security incident has occurred.\n## A. Principle of Non-Intervention\nThe most fundamental principle applicable is the principle of non-intervention. According to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) it is “part and parcel of customary international law”.¹³ When a State uses the internet in order to destabilise another country, this constitutes a violation of the principle of non-intervention. Similarly, cyber-based activities of organs of one State on computers situated in another country or relating to parts of the web situated in another country would infringe upon the latter country’s sovereignty.\nIn this area, issues such as attribution, standards of proof, etc. are more important than the substantive law, which is quite clear. In that regard, it is necessary to distinguish between computers and computer systems belonging to the government and\n¹³ International Court of Justice (ICJ), *Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua* (Nicaragua v. United States of America), Merits, Judgment of 27 June 1986, ICJ Reports 1986, para. 202.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58 · 2015\ncomputers and computer systems owned and operated by private individuals or companies. Computers belonging to the government may be presumed to be controlled by the government. Ideas for distributing responsibility under such circumstances may be borrowed from the jurisprudence and practice of human rights bodies regarding persons who are in complete control of State agents.\nThe European Court of Human Rights, for instance, argues as follows:\nWhere the events in issue lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of persons within their control in custody, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries and death occurring during such detention. Indeed, the burden of proof may be regarded as resting on the authorities to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation.^^\nThe factor of exclusive control was also taken into consideration by the ICJ in developing its standard of proof in the Corfu Channel case:\n[...] the fact of this exclusive territorial control exercised by a State within its frontiers has a bearing upon the methods of proof available to establish the knowledge of that State as to such events. By reason of this exclusive control, the other State, the victim of a breach of international law, is often unable to furnish direct proof of facts giving rise to responsibility. Such a State should be allowed a more liberal recourse to inferences of fact and circumstantial evidence. This indirect evidence is admitted in all systems of law, and its use is recognized by international decisions. It must be regarded as of special weight when it is based on a series of facts linked together and leading logically to a single conclusion.^^\nActivities on computers owned by the government are “within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities.” Hence, the following assumption may be made: Where a malicious cyber activity creating a cyber security incident can be traced back to a government computer or computer system, the activity may be attributed to the government, unless it provides a satisfactory and convincing explanation that the system was externally used (i.e. has been hacked by someone else).^^\n^ European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR), Salman v.

No-Harm Principle\nIn the *Corfu Channel* case the ICJ assumed a general duty to prevent harm. The Court ruled on a general principle to prevent harm as one of the bases for an Albanian duty to warn the British government: “[...] every State’s obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States.”¹⁹\nThe general principle has been developed in more detail in the area of international environmental law where good neighbourliness and a duty to prevent harm are considered to be part of customary law.²⁰ The main sources for this principle are the famous *Trail Smelter* arbitration²¹ and Principle 21 Stockholm Declaration/Principle 2 Rio Declaration.²²\n---\n¹⁷ International Law Commission (ILC), Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, GAOR, 56th Sess., Suppl. 10, 43 et seq.\n¹⁸ Cf. also Terry D. Gill, *Non-Intervention in the Cyber Context*, in: Ziolkowski (ed.) (note 1), 217, 226–228 and Pirker (note 1), 210–212.\n¹⁹ ICJ, *Corfu Channel* (note 15), 22.\n²⁰ Id., *Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons*, Advisory Opinion of 8 July 1996, ICJ Reports 1996, 226, para. 29; see also Patricia Birnie/Alan Boyle/Catherine Redgwell, *International Law and the Environment* (3rd ed. 2009), 137 et seq.; Philippe Sands/Jacqueline Peel, *Principles of International Environmental Law* (3rd ed. 2012), 196.\n²¹ *Trail Smelter Case* (United States, Canada), Arbitral Award of 16 April 1938 and 11 March 1941, Reports of International Arbitral Awards (RIAA) III, 1905; for an overall assessment see the various contributions in Bratspies/Miller (eds.) (note 7).\n²² The Stockholm Declaration’s wording: “States have, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and the principles of international law, the sovereign right to exploit their own resources pursuant to their own environmental policies, and the responsibility to ensure that activities within their jurisdiction or control do not cause damage to the environment of other States or of areas beyond the limits of national jurisdiction”, Stockholm Declaration of the United Nations Conference\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58 · 2015\nThese principles allow for the inclusion of harm caused by private actors.²³ In the *Corfu Channel* case mere knowledge by the Albanian authorities of the danger was sufficient, and in the *Trail Smelter* case the pollution emanated from a private plant. Thus, the principles of good neighbourliness and the duty to prevent harm extend the responsibility of States for private action beyond the strict criteria of Article 8 Articles on State Responsibility. To put the issue more generally: Responsibility of States for private action is not only caused by criteria of attribution, i.e. within the law of State responsibility, but also by the character of the primary obligations of States. Obligations of control and surveillance entail an indirect responsibility for private action if they are not respected. This reflects that there is an interaction in the law of State responsibility between the issue of attribution on the one side and the scope of the obligation of the State on the other.²⁴ In terms of the practical outcome, obligations of surveillance and control may thus constitute a substitute for the attribution of private action to a State.\nThe consequences which flow from the overall responsibility of States for harmful activities on their territory are, however, mitigated to some extent by additional criteria.\nFirst, the *Corfu Channel* formula requires “knowledge” on part of the State concerned. While the ICJ could operate with certain assumptions regarding the overall control of the territorial waters,²⁵ such an overall control certainly cannot be assumed with respect to any cyber activity on the territory of a given State.²⁶ Hence, the requirement of “knowledge” of the harmful activity will only be met in rare cases.\non the Human Environment, UN Doc.

Drumbl*, Trail Smelter and the International Law Commission’s Work on State Responsibility for Internationally Wrongful Acts and State Liability, in: Bratspies/Miller (eds.) (note 7), 86 et seq.\n²⁵ ICJ, *Corfu Channel* (note 15), 18 et seq.\n²⁶ Cf. *Pirker* (note 1), 204 et seq., also discussing some alternative conceptions.\nOBLIGATIONS OF STATES 75\nSecondly, the Trail Smelter principle²⁷ has originally been restricted in its scope by the requirement of “serious consequence” being established by “clear and convincing evidence”. It does not seem to be excluded, however, that these criteria are met in the context of cyber security incidents. For example, it has been argued that the DDoS attack on Estonia in 2007 constituted a case of “serious consequence”.²⁸ Irrespective of that it is today mostly recognised that international environmental law has developed beyond the Trail Smelter requirements.²⁹ Thus, the no-harm rule as it currently stands in customary international law only requires a certain *de minimis* threshold to be fulfilled³⁰ and the precautionary principle may be considered to have alleviated the strict Trail Smelter standard of proof.³¹\nFinally, the Trail Smelter principle is further mitigated by the requirement of due diligence.³² Today “there is a clear consensus that although the no-harm principle does not say so explicitly, a State can only breach the principle if it fails to act with due diligence.”³³ According to the ILC in its Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities (Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm) both the magnitude and the probability of harm are to be taken\n²⁷ For further elaboration on this see Russell A.

Hence, preventive action by States is both factually and legally considerably limited.\n## C. Precautionary Principle\nA similar scepticism relates to the precautionary principle, which would be the most obvious candidate for imposing preventive action. Indeed, the precautionary\n³⁴ See the commentary to Art. 3 Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm, para. 11: “The standard of due diligence against which the conduct of the State of origin should be examined is that which is generally considered to be appropriate and proportional to the degree of risk of transboundary harm in the particular instance. For example, activities which may be considered ultrahazardous require a much higher standard of care in designing policies and a much higher degree of vigour on the part of the State to enforce them. Issues such as the size of the operation; its location, special climate conditions, materials used in the activity, and whether the conclusions drawn from the application of these factors in a specific case are reasonable, are among the factors to be considered in determining the due diligence requirement in each instance. What would be considered a reasonable standard of care or due diligence may change with time; what might be considered an appropriate and reasonable procedure, standard or rule at one point in time may not be considered as such at some point in the future. Hence, due diligence in ensuring safety requires a State to keep abreast of technological changes and scientific developments” (II.C, Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities, with Commentaries (2001), Report on the Work of its 53rd Session, UN Doc. A/56/10 (2001), 377); see also the definition of “risk of causing significant transboundary harm” in Art. 2 Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm: “The definition refers to two types of activities under these articles. One is where there is a low probability of causing disastrous harm. This is normally the characteristic of ultrahazardous activities. The other one is where there is a high probability of causing significant harm. This includes activities which have a high probability of causing harm which, while not disastrous, is still significant. But it would exclude activities where there is a very low probability of causing significant transboundary harm.” (ibid., commentary para. 3).\n³⁵ Beyerlin/Marauhn (note 32), 43.\n³⁶ For a discussion of the due diligence standard’s applicability in cyberspace regulation (with reference to the ‘duty of prevention’) see also Pirker (note 1), 206–209.\nOBLIGATIONS OF STATES 77\nprinciple has assumed a prominent place in modern international law.³⁷ Although its legal basis in customary law is still being questioned,³⁸ there are clear indications to the contrary, notably regarding environmental impact assessments. The requirement to undertake an environmental impact assessment has been considered to be rooted in customary international law by several international decisions. The most prominent among them is the *Pulp Mills* case of the ICJ where the Court held that\n[...] it may now be considered a requirement under general international law to undertake an environmental impact assessment where there is a risk that the proposed industrial activity may have a significant adverse impact in a transboundary context [...].³⁹\nSimilar approaches were taken by arbitral tribunals in the *Iron Rhine Arbitration*⁴⁰ and the *Indus Waters Project*.⁴¹ It may therefore be assumed that at least in form of an environmental impact assessment the precautionary principle has entered general international law.\n³⁷ Jonathan B. Wiener, *Precaution*, in: Daniel Bodansky/Jutta Brunnée/Ellen Hey (eds.), Oxford Handbook on International Environmental Law (2007), 597, 599.\n³⁸ See *Thilo Marauhn*, *Customary Rules of International Environmental Law: Can they Provide Guidance for Developing a Peacetime Regime for Cyberspace?*, in: *Ziolkowski* (ed.) (note 1), 465, 474–476, taking a critical stance on the precautionary principle’s prospects for application in cyber contexts.\n³⁹ ICJ, *Case Concerning Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay* (Argentina v.

This duty, in the opinion of the Tribunal, has now become a principle of general international law”.\n⁴¹ *The Indus Waters Kishenganga Arbitration* (Pakistan, India), Partial Award of 18 February 2013, paras. 449 et seq., available at: http://www.pca-cpa.org/PK-IN%2020130218%20Partial%20Award%2018ba.pdf?fil_id=2101 (accessed on 11 November 2015): “There is no doubt that States are required under contemporary customary international law to take environmental protection into consideration when planning and developing projects that may cause injury to a bordering State. Since the time of Trail Smelter, a series of international conventions, declarations and judicial and arbitral decisions have addressed the need to manage natural resources in a sustainable manner. In particular, the International Court of Justice expounded upon the principle of ‘sustainable development’ in *Gabcikovo-Nagymaros*, referring to the ‘need to reconcile economic development with protection of the environment.’ Applied to large-scale construction projects, the principle of sustainable development translates, as the International Court of Justice recently put it in *Pulp Mills*, into ‘a requirement under general international law to undertake an environmental impact assessment where there is a risk that the proposed industrial activity may have a significant adverse impact in a transboundary context, in particular, on a shared resource’” (footnotes omitted).\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\nCould one transfer the concept into the cyber world in form of a ‘cyber impact assessment’ requirement?⁴² There are strong arguments against such a transposition. A starting point is that the environmental impact assessment relates to large industrial projects, which are considered to go along with specific risks for the environment. The possible sources of cyber security incidents cannot be narrowed down according to the scale of the activity. Each and every single computer, notebook, tablet, or smartphone could be the source of a cyber security incident. Hence, preventive cyber impact assessment would practically have to cover all activities in the internet. This would be incompatible with requirements of freedom of expression and communication and thus certainly go beyond what could be seen as part of general international law.\n## D. Summary Regarding Prevention\nIn sum, the preventive obligations of States in the absence of concrete cyber security incidents remain rather limited. It is impossible to postulate a general obligation to preventively monitor cyber activities which are linked to the territory of a given State. Therefore, preventive obligations are basically limited to a prohibition to actively engage in malicious cyber activity and to respect due diligence standards regarding computers and systems which are under the control of the State.\n## IV. Procedural Obligations of Cooperation and Information (During and After a Cyber Security Incident)\nDoes that situation change during or after a cyber security incident?\n## A. Good Neighbourliness as a General Source\nThis article has already referred to the principle of good neighbourliness as a general source of cooperation and information. Indeed, Article 74 UN Charter codi\n⁴² On the transferability of international environmental law rules to cyberspace activities see generally Marauhn (note 38), 481–482.\nOBLIGATIONS OF STATES 79\nfies the principle of good neighbourliness regarding all matters of social, economic, and commercial matters. Based on the ICJ’s decision in the *Haya de la Torre* case,⁴³ the legal character of the principle of good neighbourliness is sometimes questioned.⁴⁴ The better view, however, rests its analysis on the frequent reference to the principle in many international treaties and concludes on a ‘hard-law content’ of the principle.⁴⁵ Irrespective of its hard law content, two problems remain when the concept of good neighbourliness is to be applied in the context of cyber security. The first relates to geographic proximity and the second to concrete obligations to be derived from the concept.\nUsually a certain geographic proximity of the States is required when the principle of good neighbourliness is invoked. It should be noted, however, that the United Nations General Assembly, already in 1991 and outside the context of the world wide web, extended the notion of good neighbourliness to all States of the international community “whether or not they are contiguous”.⁴⁶ Even if this approach is considered too far-reaching in the general context of all inter-State relations, a good point for universal neighbourliness may be made as far as relations through the internet are concerned. Effects of cyber activities are not limited to adjacent States but can be produced anywhere. Therefore, looked at from the perspective of its purpose, *i.e.* the obligations to duly take into account possible adverse effects on a neighbouring country, transferring the principle of good neighbourliness to the world wide web leads to its application in all inter-State relations, irrespective of the geographical location of the States concerned.\nAs far as concrete obligations under the principle of good neighbourliness are concerned, it is again international environmental law which provides for the best comparison. The most broadly accepted obligation concerns an obligation of information in case of emergency. Apart from that, there exist also general obligations of information, consultation, and notification in the absence of emergency situations.\n⁴³ ICJ, *Haya de la Torre* (Colombia *v.* Peru), Judgment of 13 June 1951, ICJ Reports 1951, 71.\n⁴⁴ See e.g. *Leland M. Goodrich/Edvard Hambro/Anne Patricia Simons*, Charter of the United Nations: Commentary and Documents (3rd ed. 1969), 463.\n⁴⁵ *Laurence Boisson de Chazournes/Danio Campanelli*, Neighbour States, MPEPIL, December 2006, para. 20, available *via*: http://www.mpepil.com (accessed on 8 June 2015); *Ulrich Fastenrath*, Article 74, in: Bruno Simma *et al.* (eds.), UN Charter Commentary (3rd ed. 2012), 1840, MN 2.\n⁴⁶ GA Res. 46/92 of 9 December 1991.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\n## B. Emergency Information\nThere is a clear customary duty to inform in cases of emergency. Evidence of this duty is – again – the Corfu Channel case where the ICJ considered Albania under an obligation to warn the British warship of the mines, similar obligations of warning are contained in a number of treaties relating to the environment.⁴⁷ One may also point to duties of information concerning infections “in the real world”. Article 6 World Health Organization (WHO) International Health Regulations⁴⁸ requires States to\nnotify WHO, by the most efficient means of communication available, by way of the National IHR [International Health Regulations] Focal Point, and within 24 hours of assessment of public health information, of all events which may constitute a public health emergency of international concern within its territory [...] as well as any health measure implemented in response to those events.\nThus, in order to effectively combat their negative effects, virtual and real viruses may be treated alike.\nGiven the rapid connections via the internet, this information duty in cases of emergency may seem of limited value. On the other hand, one of the last epidemic attacks, the so-called conficker worm which primarily attacked Microsoft Windows operating systems, lasted over a period from 2008 to 2010, infecting among other institutions the German Bundeswehr, the French Navy, and the Greater Manchester Police.⁴⁹ During such a prolonged period, warning not only by the public concerned but also by States may help limiting the consequences.\n## C. Information, Consultation, and Notification Beyond Emergency Situations\nObligations from the principle of good neighbourliness which relate to activities involving a risk of harm are not limited to the ex ante situation, i.e. before the activity\n⁴⁷ For detailed references see *Birnie/Boyle/Redgwell* (note 20), 182 et seq.\n⁴⁸ Cf. Arts. 6 and 7 WHO International Health Regulations (2nd ed. 2005), WHA Doc. WHA 58.3, available at: http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2008/9789241580410_eng.pdf (accessed on 8 June 2015).

Davies*, Is There an International Duty to Protect Persons in the Event of an Epidemic?, Global Health Governance (2010), available via: http://www.ghgj.org (accessed on 8 June 2015).\n⁴⁹ For more information on this worm see e.g. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conficker (accessed on 11 November 2015).\nOBLIGATIONS OF STATES 81\nis started. This is explicitly spelled out in the ILC Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm.⁵⁰ Article 12 Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm contains a continuous obligation to exchange information.⁵¹ It would seem strange indeed if the obligations concerning information and consultation concerning environmental protection were to end once the project has started. Seen from this perspective, the continued duty to consult and inform once a project has started is basically a prolongation of the precautionary approach which creates obligations of prevention.\nAgainst this background one might be tempted to assume that – when transposed to the issue of cyber security incidents – a continued duty to consult and to inform encounters the same problems which have been highlighted concerning preventive action. However, there is an important factual difference which leads to a different analysis: At the preventive stage, *i.e.* prior to a concrete cyber security incident, it is not possible to limit the obligations to specific activities which may be considered particularly dangerous. By contrast, during or after a cyber security incident it is not unlikely that the State or States where the incident occurred or caused harmful consequences are able to narrow down possible sources and to give information on them. Under such circumstances the duty to provide information and to consult acquires a new and sufficiently specific content. Instead of being related to potentially all activities in the world wide web emanating from a specific country, the duty relates to activities which have proved harmful and thus present characteristics which allow them to be distinguished from other harmless activities. Under such circumstances it seems appropriate to assume a duty of cooperation on the part of the State where the activity allegedly emanated from and to oblige this State to share any information on the matter which is available to its authorities. In other words: While under the principle of good neighbourliness in the real world the size of a certain activity and the risks attached to it trigger general obligations of cooperation, in the cyber world it is the occurrence of a specific cyber security incident which triggers specific obligations of cooperation.\n⁵⁰ See *supra*, note 34.\n⁵¹ “While the activity is being carried out, the States concerned shall exchange in a timely manner all available information concerning that activity relevant to preventing significant transboundary harm or at any event minimizing the risk thereof. Such an exchange of information shall continue until such time as the States concerned consider it appropriate even after the activity is terminated”.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58 · 2015\nIn this context the question arises whether a certain standard of probability must be shown by the requesting State. The standard is not easy to circumscribe. It is certainly not enough if the source of the malicious activity is merely asserted. On the other hand, demanding full proof would most probably be a standard which is difficult to meet. While it is true that the ICJ in the *Oil Platforms* case demanded full proof by the United States (US) that the missile attack against their vessels constituted an armed attack by Iran on the US, which claimed to have reacted in self-defence,⁵² there is a decisive difference in the situation addressed here: The *Oil Platforms* case was about the justification of an otherwise unlawful use of force against another State. In the current context obligations of investigation and information are at issue. In other words: We are not talking about the legality of cross-border activity by one State against another, but about obligations of a State arising out of a specific situation over which it has at least territorial control. On the basis of the *Corfu Channel* case the standard of proof is lower:\nBy reason of this exclusive control, the other State, the victim of a breach of international law, is often unable to furnish direct proof of facts giving rise to responsibility. Such a State should be allowed a more liberal recourse to inferences of fact and circumstantial evidence. This indirect evidence is admitted in all systems of law, and its use is recognized by international decisions. It must be regarded as of special weight when it is based on a series of facts linked together and leading logically to a single conclusion.⁵³\n## D. Cooperation in Investigation and Prosecution\nAnother issue concerns obligations of investigation and prosecution. In order to be clear on the previous point of information and cooperation: The obligation to share information can only relate to information which is already available to the authorities. A certainly more far-reaching obligation would concern investigation and collection of information which is *not yet available*. It is to this point that I now want to turn.\n⁵² ICJ, *Case Concerning Oil Platforms* (Islamic Republic of Iran v. United States of America), Judgment of 6 November 2003, ICJ Reports 2003, 161, paras. 57 et seq.\n⁵³ See *id.*, *Corfu Channel* (note 15), 18.\nOBLIGATIONS OF STATES 83\n## 1. The General Framework for International Criminal Cooperation\nUnder the general framework for international criminal cooperation there are only very limited generally applicable rules. Although the field is moving fast towards closer cooperation,⁵⁴ in the absence of specific treaty provisions mutual assistance in international criminal law is still dominated by traditional views on sovereignty which give the requested State broad discretion in whether at all, and if so under which conditions, it will meet a request for assistance.\nThe main tools which exist within the framework of international criminal cooperation concern requests for extradition and mutual assistance in other matters of criminal investigation, such as witnesses, evidence, etc. Regarding both institutions there are no general, but only specific obligations concerning either certain crimes (i.e. the application of the *aut dedere aut iudicare* principle to acts of terrorism) or the respective obligations are contained in specific treaties on mutual cooperation in criminal matters.\n## 2. Obligations Contained in the Budapest Convention\nThe most elaborate treaty relating to international criminal cooperation concerning crimes related to cyberspace is, again, the Budapest Convention. Apart from defining cyber crime offences, the Convention requires its parties to enact certain investigative procedures for the inquiry into cyber crimes: expedited preservation of stored computer data (Article 16 Budapest Convention), preservation and disclosure of traffic data (Article 17 Budapest Convention), search and seizure of stored computer data (Article 19 Budapest Convention), real-time collection of traffic data (Article 20 Budapest Convention), and, finally, the interception of content data (Article 21 Budapest Convention).\nIn its third part the Convention deals with international cooperation in the areas of extradition, mutual assistance, and establishment of permanent points of contact (Articles 23–35 Budapest Convention). These provisions explicitly take up obliga-\n⁵⁴ *Tim René Salomon*, Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters, MPEPIL, January 2013, paras. 36 *et seq.*, available via: http://www.mpepil.com (accessed on 8 June 2015).\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\ntions which are contained in general treaties on extradition or mutual assistance and extend existing general obligations to cyber crimes as defined under the Budapest Convention (Article 24 (2) Budapest Convention and, with certain limits, Article 25 (4) Budapest Convention concerning mutual assistance).\nAccording to the working definition of cyber security incidents given above, every cyber security incident automatically constitutes a cyber crime under the Convention. Hence the procedural obligations of the Convention apply as far as States parties of the Budapest Convention are concerned. Given the fact that the focus of this analysis rests on general international law, the obligations under the Budapest Convention will, however, not be looked into in more detail.\n## 3. Transposing Obligations of Investigation Developed in International Human Rights Adjudication\nAnother area of inspiration for obligations to investigate may be found in the jurisprudence of international human rights bodies relating to positive obligations of States in case of human rights violations. There is a clear and – it seems – widely accepted obligation to investigate in two groups of cases. The first has already been dealt with in the context of a reversal of the burden of proof, namely situations of complete control by the State (i.e. prisons and other institutions for detaining persons). On the basis of this jurisprudence it may be argued that an obligation to investigate arises where malicious cyber activity can be traced back to a computer or computer system controlled by another State. At first sight one might object that the situations of an individual human rights claim on the one side and inter-State obligations on the other are not compatible. There is, however, a common denominator which is the exclusive control of the State. In that regard, the two situations do not differ decisively. Hence, obligations of investigation may be assumed concerning computers and computer systems under the control of the government.\n## 4. Transborder Access to Data\nThe issue of transborder access to data has gained a lot of public attention in recent days. The Budapest Convention left the issue deliberately open. Article 32 Budapest\nOBLIGATIONS OF STATES\nConvention only regulates the easy cases of data which is publicly available (lit. a) and consent by the person who has the lawful authority to disclose the data (lit. b). One might be tempted to conclude that the express regulation of only these two instances *e contrario* precludes any other transborder access to data. However, the explanatory report excludes this argument by referring to Article 39 Budapest Convention according to which other obligations are neither created nor precluded.⁵⁵\nThe issue of transborder access to data is currently being discussed in the context of a possible Additional Protocol to the Budapest Convention. If my reading of the papers which are publicly available⁵⁶ is correct, there are a number of different proposals on the table. Discussing them would probably require a paper on its own.\nFor that reason I do not want to go into details of transborder access to data. I will limit my comments on this issue to one single point: If the analysis above is correct that under certain circumstances obligations of information and even of investigation may arise out of specific cyber security incidents, the argument may be made that transborder access to data may be justified as a countermeasure if a State does not meet its obligations of investigation (and the other conditions for lawful countermeasures are met).\n## V. Overall Assessment\nTo conclude, the legal obligations of States before, during, and after a cyber security incident can be summarised in two final points:\n1. All States are cyber neighbours. Therefore, in general international law the principle of good neighbourliness is the most promising candidate for developing obligations of cooperation and assistance in dealing with malicious cyber activities. The most important challenge consists in the fact that it is impossible to distin\n⁵⁵ Council of Europe, Explanatory Report to the Convention on Cybercrime, para. 293, available at: https://rm.coe.int/CoERMPublicCommonSearchServices/DisplayDCTMContent?documentId=09000016800ce5b (accessed on 6 November 2015).

As a consequence of this specific characteristic of cyber activities the focus must be laid on obligations of cooperation during and after a cyber security incident, rather than at the preventive stage."

On the basis of this assumption, the author inquires into possible principles and rules established in general international law which could be relied on in order to address cyber security incidents, i.e. inter-State conflicts relating to cyberspace which remain below the threshold of the notions of use of force or armed conflict.\nRelying mainly on principles established in international environmental law, it is argued that the principle of good neighbourliness is the most promising candidate for developing obligations of cooperation and assistance in dealing with malicious cyber activities. However, one crucial difference between hazardous activities relating to the environment and threats in cyberspace is spelled out: In contrast to activities with potential dangers for the environment, with regard to the internet it is impossible to distinguish 'hazardous' activities from non-hazardous activities. For this reason it is impossible to establish thresholds or activities in cyberspace which could serve as triggers for preventive obligations. As a consequence, the focus must be laid on obligations of cooperation and assistance during and after a cyber security incident, rather than at the preventive stage.\nKEYWORDS: Cyber Security, Good Neighbourliness, Corfu Channel Case, Burden of Proof, Prevention, Obligations of Cooperation ## I. Introduction The internet presents many challenges to international law. Its virtual character is considered to put into question the principle of territoriality which in many areas is fundamental to international law as it currently stands. The rapidity of cyber activity requires swift and often coordinated if not collective action by more than one State.\n* Professor for Public and Public International Law, Institute for International Law, Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Munich.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58 · 2015 Finally, private actors play an important role. This means, on the one side, that issues of State responsibility for private activities have to be addressed, and on the other, that human rights issues must be taken into account. All of this does not fit easily into the inter-State paradigm of mutual obligations between States. The following considerations thus necessarily are of a preliminary, explorative character.\n## II. General Assumptions ## A. Concerning the Role of States A first general assumption relates to the role of States in regulating the internet. In contrast to some positions in literature, in the following the internet is not viewed as a legal space which is distinct from the territory of States and thus subject to its own, independent legal regime. The internet certainly has an important transnational dimension, but that does not mean that it is intrinsically transnational and cannot be made subject to regulations from individual States. Rather, the following considerations are based on a territorial approach according to which ‘the Internet’ is viewed as being – at least in most parts – covered by the authority of the State on whose territory a specific activity in question takes place, i.e. where a person physically conducts his or her malicious activity or where a server or computer on which the activity takes place is located.¹ Specific problems may arise in the context of data which move frequently between different servers and different locations. Given the frequency and rapidity with which the location of data may be changed, the situation of such data has been described as a “loss of location”.² However, these specific problems of ‘data in the cloud(s)’ may ¹ Eneken Tikk, Ten Rules for Cyber Security, Survival: Global Politics and Strategy 53 (2011), 119, 121; Johann-Christoph Woltag, Computer Network Operations Below the Level of Armed Force, European Society of International Law (ESIL) Conference Paper No. 1/2011, 12, available via: http://www.esil-sedi.eu/node/697 (accessed on 31 October 2015); Benedikt Pirker, Territorial Integrity and the Challenges of Cyberspace, in: Katharina Ziolkowski (ed.), Peacetime Regime for State Activities in Cyberspace (2013), 189, 193 et seq. For a similar approach see Art. 22 (1)(a)–(c) Convention on Cybercrime, 23 November 2001, ETS No. 185 (Budapest Convention); specific problems of activities in internationalised territories such as the high seas are left aside, given their presumably small practical relevance.\n² Council of Europe, Economic Crime Division, Cloud Computing and Cybercrime Investigations: Territoriality vs. the Power of Disposal?, Discussion Paper, 31 August 2010, available at: rm.coe.int/ OBLIGATIONS OF STATES 69 require specific methods of inquiry and access, but they do not change the fundamental principle of territoriality.\n## B. Concerning the Term ‘Cyber Security Incident’ The term ‘cyber security incident’ is vague. It competes with other notions such as ‘cyber warfare’, ‘cyber terrorism’, ‘cyber conflict’, ‘cyber threat’, ‘cyber crime’, or ‘cyber attack’.³ Some of these terms go along with certain strategies to ensure cyber security:⁴ ‘Cyber crime’ suggests a criminal law approach, ‘cyber warfare’ obviously alludes to use of force and international humanitarian law, etc.\n‘Cyber security incident’ may cover incidents as different as the distributed denial of service attack (DDoS) on the Estonian public computer system in 2007,⁵ the Stuxnet worm, which was apparently specifically designed for halting the Iranian nuclear programme,⁶ the hacking of computer systems of private companies for the purpose of industrial espionage and other cases of internet torts,⁷ hacktivist actions for the promotion of political ideas,⁸ etc. One could even include the military dimension under the label of ‘cyber security incident’. However, given that most malicious cyber activity does not reach the level of armed force, only incidents remaining below CoERM Public Common Search Services / Display DCTM Content? document Id=09000016802fa3df (accessed on 31 October 2015); see also Cybercrime Convention Committee (T-CY), (Draft) Elements of an Additional Protocol to the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime regarding transborder access to data, 9 April 2013, T-CY (2013)14, available at: https://www.coe.int/t/dghl/cooperation/economic crime/Source/Cybercrime/TCY/TCY%202013/T-CY%282013%2914transb_elements_protocol_V2.pdf (accessed on 11 November 2015).\n³ See, for an attempt to clarify the relationship of several competing notions, Oona A.

In order to further clarify the notion of ‘cyber security incident’, it is helpful to look at the Convention on Cybercrime (Budapest Convention).¹⁰ ## C. The CoE Convention on Cybercrime (Budapest Convention) A few words concerning the Budapest Convention are in place by way of introduction: The Convention is the most comprehensive binding international document relating to cyber security.¹¹ Currently the Budapest Convention has 47 parties, among them several States who are not members of the Council of Europe (USA, Japan, Australia, and the Dominican Republic). There are further non-European signatories which have not yet ratified the Convention (Canada and South Africa). The Convention follows a criminal law approach and seeks to harmonise national laws by defining certain computer-related offences and setting minimum standards for the methods of their investigation and concerning the cooperation between States.¹² The definition covers offences against the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of computer-related data and systems (Articles 2–6 Budapest Convention), computer-related offences (forgery and fraud, Articles 7 and 8 Budapest Convention), content-related offences (child pornography, Article 9 Budapest Convention), and finally offences relating to infringements of copyright and related rights (Article 10 Budapest Convention).\n⁹ Charter of the United Nations, 26 June 1945, UNCIO 15, 335 (UN Charter).\n¹⁰ See supra, note 1. For a recent account of the Convention see Sophie Kwasny, Lutte contre la cybercriminalité et respect des droits de l'homme: Les instruments du Conseil de l'Europe, in: Société Française Pour le Droit International (ed.), Internet et le droit international: Colloque de Rouen (2014), 339.\n¹¹ See e.g. Paul Rosenzweig, International Law and Private Actor Active Cyber Defensive Measures, Stanford Journal of International Law 50 (2014), 103, 108; Hathaway et al. (note 3), 862.\n¹² For an analysis see Michael A. Vatis, The Council of Europe Convention on Cyber Crime, in: National Research Council (ed.), Proceedings of a Workshop on Deterring Cyber-Attacks: Informing Strategies and Developing Options for U.S. Policy (2010), 207; Robert Uerpmann-Wittzack, Internet-völkerrecht, Archiv des Völkerrechts 47 (2009), 261, 269–270.\nOBLIGATIONS OF STATES 71 Due to its criminal law approach, the Budapest Convention includes issues which are not related to inter-State security or to obligations incumbent upon States to ensure that their territories are not used for purposes which are harmful to other States. A more limited approach is therefore warranted for the purposes of this contribution. Accordingly, I propose to limit the notion of ‘cyber security incident’ to those crimes which relate to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of computer data and systems. A cyber security incident thus occurs whenever computers or computer systems are illegally accessed or destroyed or when data are illegally intercepted, deleted, or altered.\n## III. General Obligations of Prevention The first phase of possible obligations relates to the situation prior to a cyber security incident. In this phase obligations of prevention are of interest. These aspects will be dealt with first (III.). In a second step obligations of cooperation and information will be dealt with (IV.). These obligations are mostly relevant during or after a cyber security incident has occurred.\n## A. Principle of Non-Intervention The most fundamental principle applicable is the principle of non-intervention. According to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) it is “part and parcel of customary international law”.¹³ When a State uses the internet in order to destabilise another country, this constitutes a violation of the principle of non-intervention. Similarly, cyber-based activities of organs of one State on computers situated in another country or relating to parts of the web situated in another country would infringe upon the latter country’s sovereignty.\nIn this area, issues such as attribution, standards of proof, etc. are more important than the substantive law, which is quite clear. In that regard, it is necessary to distinguish between computers and computer systems belonging to the government and ¹³ International Court of Justice (ICJ), *Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua* (Nicaragua v. United States of America), Merits, Judgment of 27 June 1986, ICJ Reports 1986, para. 202.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58 · 2015 computers and computer systems owned and operated by private individuals or companies. Computers belonging to the government may be presumed to be controlled by the government. Ideas for distributing responsibility under such circumstances may be borrowed from the jurisprudence and practice of human rights bodies regarding persons who are in complete control of State agents.\nThe European Court of Human Rights, for instance, argues as follows: Where the events in issue lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of persons within their control in custody, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries and death occurring during such detention. Indeed, the burden of proof may be regarded as resting on the authorities to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation.^[14]^ The factor of exclusive control was also taken into consideration by the ICJ in developing its standard of proof in the Corfu Channel case: [...] the fact of this exclusive territorial control exercised by a State within its frontiers has a bearing upon the methods of proof available to establish the knowledge of that State as to such events. By reason of this exclusive control, the other State, the victim of a breach of international law, is often unable to furnish direct proof of facts giving rise to responsibility. Such a State should be allowed a more liberal recourse to inferences of fact and circumstantial evidence. This indirect evidence is admitted in all systems of law, and its use is recognized by international decisions. It must be regarded as of special weight when it is based on a series of facts linked together and leading logically to a single conclusion.^[15]^ Activities on computers owned by the government are “within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities.” Hence, the following assumption may be made: Where a malicious cyber activity creating a cyber security incident can be traced back to a government computer or computer system, the activity may be attributed to the government, unless it provides a satisfactory and convincing explanation that the system was externally used (i.e. has been hacked by someone else).^[16]^ ^[14] European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR), Salman v.

No-Harm Principle In the *Corfu Channel* case the ICJ assumed a general duty to prevent harm. The Court ruled on a general principle to prevent harm as one of the bases for an Albanian duty to warn the British government: “[...] every State’s obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States.”¹⁹ The general principle has been developed in more detail in the area of international environmental law where good neighbourliness and a duty to prevent harm are considered to be part of customary law.²⁰ The main sources for this principle are the famous *Trail Smelter* arbitration²¹ and Principle 21 Stockholm Declaration/Principle 2 Rio Declaration.²² --- ¹⁷ International Law Commission (ILC), Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, GAOR, 56th Sess., Suppl. 10, 43 et seq.\n¹⁸ Cf. also Terry D.

(note 7).\n²² The Stockholm Declaration’s wording: “States have, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and the principles of international law, the sovereign right to exploit their own resources pursuant to their own environmental policies, and the responsibility to ensure that activities within their jurisdiction or control do not cause damage to the environment of other States or of areas beyond the limits of national jurisdiction”, Stockholm Declaration of the United Nations Conference GERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58 · 2015 These principles allow for the inclusion of harm caused by private actors.²³ In the *Corfu Channel* case mere knowledge by the Albanian authorities of the danger was sufficient, and in the *Trail Smelter* case the pollution emanated from a private plant. Thus, the principles of good neighbourliness and the duty to prevent harm extend the responsibility of States for private action beyond the strict criteria of Article 8 Articles on State Responsibility. To put the issue more generally: Responsibility of States for private action is not only caused by criteria of attribution, i.e. within the law of State responsibility, but also by the character of the primary obligations of States. Obligations of control and surveillance entail an indirect responsibility for private action if they are not respected. This reflects that there is an interaction in the law of State responsibility between the issue of attribution on the one side and the scope of the obligation of the State on the other.²⁴ In terms of the practical outcome, obligations of surveillance and control may thus constitute a substitute for the attribution of private action to a State.\nThe consequences which flow from the overall responsibility of States for harmful activities on their territory are, however, mitigated to some extent by additional criteria.\nFirst, the *Corfu Channel* formula requires “knowledge” on part of the State concerned. While the ICJ could operate with certain assumptions regarding the overall control of the territorial waters,²⁵ such an overall control certainly cannot be assumed with respect to any cyber activity on the territory of a given State.²⁶ Hence, the requirement of “knowledge” of the harmful activity will only be met in rare cases.\non the Human Environment, UN Doc.

It does not seem to be excluded, however, that these criteria are met in the context of cyber security incidents. For example, it has been argued that the DDoS attack on Estonia in 2007 constituted a case of “serious consequence”.²⁸ Irrespective of that it is today mostly recognised that international environmental law has developed beyond the Trail Smelter requirements.²⁹ Thus, the no-harm rule as it currently stands in customary international law only requires a certain *de minimis* threshold to be fulfilled³⁰ and the precautionary principle may be considered to have alleviated the strict Trail Smelter standard of proof.³¹ Finally, the Trail Smelter principle is further mitigated by the requirement of due diligence.³² Today “there is a clear consensus that although the no-harm principle does not say so explicitly, a State can only breach the principle if it fails to act with due diligence.”³³ According to the ILC in its Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities (Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm) both the magnitude and the probability of harm are to be taken ²⁷ For further elaboration on this see Russell A.

Hence, preventive action by States is both factually and legally considerably limited.\n## C. Precautionary Principle A similar scepticism relates to the precautionary principle, which would be the most obvious candidate for imposing preventive action. Indeed, the precautionary ³⁴ See the commentary to Art. 3 Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm, para. 11: “The standard of due diligence against which the conduct of the State of origin should be examined is that which is generally considered to be appropriate and proportional to the degree of risk of transboundary harm in the particular instance. For example, activities which may be considered ultrahazardous require a much higher standard of care in designing policies and a much higher degree of vigour on the part of the State to enforce them. Issues such as the size of the operation; its location, special climate conditions, materials used in the activity, and whether the conclusions drawn from the application of these factors in a specific case are reasonable, are among the factors to be considered in determining the due diligence requirement in each instance. What would be considered a reasonable standard of care or due diligence may change with time; what might be considered an appropriate and reasonable procedure, standard or rule at one point in time may not be considered as such at some point in the future. Hence, due diligence in ensuring safety requires a State to keep abreast of technological changes and scientific developments” (II.C, Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities, with Commentaries (2001), Report on the Work of its 53rd Session, UN Doc. A/56/10 (2001), 377); see also the definition of “risk of causing significant transboundary harm” in Art. 2 Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm: “The definition refers to two types of activities under these articles. One is where there is a low probability of causing disastrous harm. This is normally the characteristic of ultrahazardous activities. The other one is where there is a high probability of causing significant harm. This includes activities which have a high probability of causing harm which, while not disastrous, is still significant. But it would exclude activities where there is a very low probability of causing significant transboundary harm.” (ibid., commentary para. 3).\n³⁵ Beyerlin/Marauhn (note 32), 43.\n³⁶ For a discussion of the due diligence standard’s applicability in cyberspace regulation (with reference to the ‘duty of prevention’) see also Pirker (note 1), 206–209.\nOBLIGATIONS OF STATES 77 principle has assumed a prominent place in modern international law.³⁷ Although its legal basis in customary law is still being questioned,³⁸ there are clear indications to the contrary, notably regarding environmental impact assessments. The requirement to undertake an environmental impact assessment has been considered to be rooted in customary international law by several international decisions. The most prominent among them is the *Pulp Mills* case of the ICJ where the Court held that [...] it may now be considered a requirement under general international law to undertake an environmental impact assessment where there is a risk that the proposed industrial activity may have a significant adverse impact in a transboundary context [...].³⁹ Similar approaches were taken by arbitral tribunals in the *Iron Rhine Arbitration*⁴⁰ and the *Indus Waters Project*.⁴¹ It may therefore be assumed that at least in form of an environmental impact assessment the precautionary principle has entered general international law.\n³⁷ Jonathan B. Wiener, *Precaution*, in: Daniel Bodansky/Jutta Brunnée/Ellen Hey (eds.), Oxford Handbook on International Environmental Law (2007), 597, 599.\n³⁸ See *Thilo Marauhn*, *Customary Rules of International Environmental Law: Can they Provide Guidance for Developing a Peacetime Regime for Cyberspace?*, in: *Ziolkowski* (ed.) (note 1), 465, 474–476, taking a critical stance on the precautionary principle’s prospects for application in cyber contexts.\n³⁹ ICJ, *Case Concerning Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay* (Argentina v. Uruguay), Judgment of 20 April 2010, ICJ Reports 2010, 14, para. 204.\n⁴⁰ *Arbitration Regarding the Iron Rhine (‘Ijzeren Rijn’) Railway* (Belgium, The Netherlands), Arbitral Award of 24 May 2005, RIAA XXVII, para. 59: “Environmental law and the law on development stand not as alternatives but as mutually reinforcing, integral concepts, which require that where development may cause significant harm to the environment there is a duty to prevent, or at least mitigate, such harm (see paragraph 222). This duty, in the opinion of the Tribunal, has now become a principle of general international law”.\n⁴¹ *The Indus Waters Kishenganga Arbitration* (Pakistan, India), Partial Award of 18 February 2013, paras. 449 et seq., available at: http://www.pca-cpa.org/PK-IN%2020130218%20Partial%20Award%2018ba.pdf?fil_id=2101 (accessed on 11 November 2015): “There is no doubt that States are required under contemporary customary international law to take environmental protection into consideration when planning and developing projects that may cause injury to a bordering State. Since the time of Trail Smelter, a series of international conventions, declarations and judicial and arbitral decisions have addressed the need to manage natural resources in a sustainable manner. In particular, the International Court of Justice expounded upon the principle of ‘sustainable development’ in *Gabcikovo-Nagymaros*, referring to the ‘need to reconcile economic development with protection of the environment.’ Applied to large-scale construction projects, the principle of sustainable development translates, as the International Court of Justice recently put it in *Pulp Mills*, into ‘a requirement under general international law to undertake an environmental impact assessment where there is a risk that the proposed industrial activity may have a significant adverse impact in a transboundary context, in particular, on a shared resource’” (footnotes omitted).\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015 Could one transfer the concept into the cyber world in form of a ‘cyber impact assessment’ requirement?⁴² There are strong arguments against such a transposition. A starting point is that the environmental impact assessment relates to large industrial projects, which are considered to go along with specific risks for the environment. The possible sources of cyber security incidents cannot be narrowed down according to the scale of the activity. Each and every single computer, notebook, tablet, or smartphone could be the source of a cyber security incident. Hence, preventive cyber impact assessment would practically have to cover all activities in the internet. This would be incompatible with requirements of freedom of expression and communication and thus certainly go beyond what could be seen as part of general international law.\n## D. Summary Regarding Prevention In sum, the preventive obligations of States in the absence of concrete cyber security incidents remain rather limited. It is impossible to postulate a general obligation to preventively monitor cyber activities which are linked to the territory of a given State. Therefore, preventive obligations are basically limited to a prohibition to actively engage in malicious cyber activity and to respect due diligence standards regarding computers and systems which are under the control of the State.\n## IV. Procedural Obligations of Cooperation and Information (During and After a Cyber Security Incident) Does that situation change during or after a cyber security incident?\n## A. Good Neighbourliness as a General Source This article has already referred to the principle of good neighbourliness as a general source of cooperation and information. Indeed, Article 74 UN Charter codi ⁴² On the transferability of international environmental law rules to cyberspace activities see generally Marauhn (note 38), 481–482.\nOBLIGATIONS OF STATES 79 fies the principle of good neighbourliness regarding all matters of social, economic, and commercial matters. Based on the ICJ’s decision in the *Haya de la Torre* case,⁴³ the legal character of the principle of good neighbourliness is sometimes questioned.⁴⁴ The better view, however, rests its analysis on the frequent reference to the principle in many international treaties and concludes on a ‘hard-law content’ of the principle.⁴⁵ Irrespective of its hard law content, two problems remain when the concept of good neighbourliness is to be applied in the context of cyber security. The first relates to geographic proximity and the second to concrete obligations to be derived from the concept.\nUsually a certain geographic proximity of the States is required when the principle of good neighbourliness is invoked. It should be noted, however, that the United Nations General Assembly, already in 1991 and outside the context of the world wide web, extended the notion of good neighbourliness to all States of the international community “whether or not they are contiguous”.⁴⁶ Even if this approach is considered too far-reaching in the general context of all inter-State relations, a good point for universal neighbourliness may be made as far as relations through the internet are concerned. Effects of cyber activities are not limited to adjacent States but can be produced anywhere. Therefore, looked at from the perspective of its purpose, *i.e.* the obligations to duly take into account possible adverse effects on a neighbouring country, transferring the principle of good neighbourliness to the world wide web leads to its application in all inter-State relations, irrespective of the geographical location of the States concerned.\nAs far as concrete obligations under the principle of good neighbourliness are concerned, it is again international environmental law which provides for the best comparison. The most broadly accepted obligation concerns an obligation of information in case of emergency. Apart from that, there exist also general obligations of information, consultation, and notification in the absence of emergency situations.\n⁴³ ICJ, *Haya de la Torre* (Colombia *v.* Peru), Judgment of 13 June 1951, ICJ Reports 1951, 71.\n⁴⁴ See e.g. *Leland M. Goodrich/Edvard Hambro/Anne Patricia Simons*, Charter of the United Nations: Commentary and Documents (3rd ed. 1969), 463.\n⁴⁵ *Laurence Boisson de Chazournes/Danio Campanelli*, Neighbour States, MPEPIL, December 2006, para. 20, available *via*: http://www.mpepil.com (accessed on 8 June 2015); *Ulrich Fastenrath*, Article 74, in: Bruno Simma *et al.* (eds.), UN Charter Commentary (3rd ed. 2012), 1840, MN 2.\n⁴⁶ GA Res. 46/92 of 9 December 1991.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015 ## B. Emergency Information There is a clear customary duty to inform in cases of emergency. Evidence of this duty is – again – the Corfu Channel case where the ICJ considered Albania under an obligation to warn the British warship of the mines, similar obligations of warning are contained in a number of treaties relating to the environment.⁴⁷ One may also point to duties of information concerning infections “in the real world”. Article 6 World Health Organization (WHO) International Health Regulations⁴⁸ requires States to notify WHO, by the most efficient means of communication available, by way of the National IHR [International Health Regulations] Focal Point, and within 24 hours of assessment of public health information, of all events which may constitute a public health emergency of international concern within its territory [...] as well as any health measure implemented in response to those events.\nThus, in order to effectively combat their negative effects, virtual and real viruses may be treated alike.\nGiven the rapid connections via the internet, this information duty in cases of emergency may seem of limited value. On the other hand, one of the last epidemic attacks, the so-called conficker worm which primarily attacked Microsoft Windows operating systems, lasted over a period from 2008 to 2010, infecting among other institutions the German Bundeswehr, the French Navy, and the Greater Manchester Police.⁴⁹ During such a prolonged period, warning not only by the public concerned but also by States may help limiting the consequences.\n## C. Information, Consultation, and Notification Beyond Emergency Situations Obligations from the principle of good neighbourliness which relate to activities involving a risk of harm are not limited to the ex ante situation, i.e. before the activity ⁴⁷ For detailed references see *Birnie/Boyle/Redgwell* (note 20), 182 et seq.\n⁴⁸ Cf. Arts. 6 and 7 WHO International Health Regulations (2nd ed. 2005), WHA Doc. WHA 58.3, available at: http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2008/9789241580410_eng.pdf (accessed on 8 June 2015). For an analysis see *Sara E. Davies*, Is There an International Duty to Protect Persons in the Event of an Epidemic?, Global Health Governance (2010), available via: http://www.ghgj.org (accessed on 8 June 2015).\n⁴⁹ For more information on this worm see e.g. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conficker (accessed on 11 November 2015).\nOBLIGATIONS OF STATES 81 is started. This is explicitly spelled out in the ILC Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm.⁵⁰ Article 12 Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm contains a continuous obligation to exchange information.⁵¹ It would seem strange indeed if the obligations concerning information and consultation concerning environmental protection were to end once the project has started. Seen from this perspective, the continued duty to consult and inform once a project has started is basically a prolongation of the precautionary approach which creates obligations of prevention.\nAgainst this background one might be tempted to assume that – when transposed to the issue of cyber security incidents – a continued duty to consult and to inform encounters the same problems which have been highlighted concerning preventive action. However, there is an important factual difference which leads to a different analysis: At the preventive stage, *i.e.* prior to a concrete cyber security incident, it is not possible to limit the obligations to specific activities which may be considered particularly dangerous. By contrast, during or after a cyber security incident it is not unlikely that the State or States where the incident occurred or caused harmful consequences are able to narrow down possible sources and to give information on them. Under such circumstances the duty to provide information and to consult acquires a new and sufficiently specific content. Instead of being related to potentially all activities in the world wide web emanating from a specific country, the duty relates to activities which have proved harmful and thus present characteristics which allow them to be distinguished from other harmless activities. Under such circumstances it seems appropriate to assume a duty of cooperation on the part of the State where the activity allegedly emanated from and to oblige this State to share any information on the matter which is available to its authorities. In other words: While under the principle of good neighbourliness in the real world the size of a certain activity and the risks attached to it trigger general obligations of cooperation, in the cyber world it is the occurrence of a specific cyber security incident which triggers specific obligations of cooperation.\n⁵⁰ See *supra*, note 34.\n⁵¹ “While the activity is being carried out, the States concerned shall exchange in a timely manner all available information concerning that activity relevant to preventing significant transboundary harm or at any event minimizing the risk thereof. Such an exchange of information shall continue until such time as the States concerned consider it appropriate even after the activity is terminated”.\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58 · 2015 In this context the question arises whether a certain standard of probability must be shown by the requesting State. The standard is not easy to circumscribe. It is certainly not enough if the source of the malicious activity is merely asserted. On the other hand, demanding full proof would most probably be a standard which is difficult to meet. While it is true that the ICJ in the *Oil Platforms* case demanded full proof by the United States (US) that the missile attack against their vessels constituted an armed attack by Iran on the US, which claimed to have reacted in self-defence,⁵² there is a decisive difference in the situation addressed here: The *Oil Platforms* case was about the justification of an otherwise unlawful use of force against another State. In the current context obligations of investigation and information are at issue. In other words: We are not talking about the legality of cross-border activity by one State against another, but about obligations of a State arising out of a specific situation over which it has at least territorial control. On the basis of the *Corfu Channel* case the standard of proof is lower: By reason of this exclusive control, the other State, the victim of a breach of international law, is often unable to furnish direct proof of facts giving rise to responsibility. Such a State should be allowed a more liberal recourse to inferences of fact and circumstantial evidence. This indirect evidence is admitted in all systems of law, and its use is recognized by international decisions. It must be regarded as of special weight when it is based on a series of facts linked together and leading logically to a single conclusion.⁵³ ## D. Cooperation in Investigation and Prosecution Another issue concerns obligations of investigation and prosecution. In order to be clear on the previous point of information and cooperation: The obligation to share information can only relate to information which is already available to the authorities. A certainly more far-reaching obligation would concern investigation and collection of information which is *not yet available*. It is to this point that I now want to turn.\n⁵² ICJ, *Case Concerning Oil Platforms* (Islamic Republic of Iran v. United States of America), Judgment of 6 November 2003, ICJ Reports 2003, 161, paras. 57 et seq.\n⁵³ See *id.*, *Corfu Channel* (note 15), 18.\nOBLIGATIONS OF STATES 83 ## 1. The General Framework for International Criminal Cooperation Under the general framework for international criminal cooperation there are only very limited generally applicable rules. Although the field is moving fast towards closer cooperation,⁵⁴ in the absence of specific treaty provisions mutual assistance in international criminal law is still dominated by traditional views on sovereignty which give the requested State broad discretion in whether at all, and if so under which conditions, it will meet a request for assistance.\nThe main tools which exist within the framework of international criminal cooperation concern requests for extradition and mutual assistance in other matters of criminal investigation, such as witnesses, evidence, etc. Regarding both institutions there are no general, but only specific obligations concerning either certain crimes (i.e. the application of the *aut dedere aut iudicare* principle to acts of terrorism) or the respective obligations are contained in specific treaties on mutual cooperation in criminal matters.\n## 2. Obligations Contained in the Budapest Convention The most elaborate treaty relating to international criminal cooperation concerning crimes related to cyberspace is, again, the Budapest Convention. Apart from defining cyber crime offences, the Convention requires its parties to enact certain investigative procedures for the inquiry into cyber crimes: expedited preservation of stored computer data (Article 16 Budapest Convention), preservation and disclosure of traffic data (Article 17 Budapest Convention), search and seizure of stored computer data (Article 19 Budapest Convention), real-time collection of traffic data (Article 20 Budapest Convention), and, finally, the interception of content data (Article 21 Budapest Convention).\nIn its third part the Convention deals with international cooperation in the areas of extradition, mutual assistance, and establishment of permanent points of contact (Articles 23–35 Budapest Convention). These provisions explicitly take up obliga- ⁵⁴ *Tim René Salomon*, Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters, MPEPIL, January 2013, paras. 36 *et seq.*, available via: http://www.mpepil.com (accessed on 8 June 2015).\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015 tions which are contained in general treaties on extradition or mutual assistance and extend existing general obligations to cyber crimes as defined under the Budapest Convention (Article 24 (2) Budapest Convention and, with certain limits, Article 25 (4) Budapest Convention concerning mutual assistance).\nAccording to the working definition of cyber security incidents given above, every cyber security incident automatically constitutes a cyber crime under the Convention. Hence the procedural obligations of the Convention apply as far as States parties of the Budapest Convention are concerned. Given the fact that the focus of this analysis rests on general international law, the obligations under the Budapest Convention will, however, not be looked into in more detail.\n## 3. Transposing Obligations of Investigation Developed in International Human Rights Adjudication Another area of inspiration for obligations to investigate may be found in the jurisprudence of international human rights bodies relating to positive obligations of States in case of human rights violations. There is a clear and – it seems – widely accepted obligation to investigate in two groups of cases. The first has already been dealt with in the context of a reversal of the burden of proof, namely situations of complete control by the State (i.e. prisons and other institutions for detaining persons). On the basis of this jurisprudence it may be argued that an obligation to investigate arises where malicious cyber activity can be traced back to a computer or computer system controlled by another State. At first sight one might object that the situations of an individual human rights claim on the one side and inter-State obligations on the other are not compatible. There is, however, a common denominator which is the exclusive control of the State. In that regard, the two situations do not differ decisively. Hence, obligations of investigation may be assumed concerning computers and computer systems under the control of the government.\n## 4. Transborder Access to Data The issue of transborder access to data has gained a lot of public attention in recent days. The Budapest Convention left the issue deliberately open. Article 32 Budapest OBLIGATIONS OF STATES Convention only regulates the easy cases of data which is publicly available (lit. a) and consent by the person who has the lawful authority to disclose the data (lit. b). One might be tempted to conclude that the express regulation of only these two instances *e contrario* precludes any other transborder access to data. However, the explanatory report excludes this argument by referring to Article 39 Budapest Convention according to which other obligations are neither created nor precluded.⁵⁵ The issue of transborder access to data is currently being discussed in the context of a possible Additional Protocol to the Budapest Convention. If my reading of the papers which are publicly available⁵⁶ is correct, there are a number of different proposals on the table. Discussing them would probably require a paper on its own.\nFor that reason I do not want to go into details of transborder access to data. I will limit my comments on this issue to one single point: If the analysis above is correct that under certain circumstances obligations of information and even of investigation may arise out of specific cyber security incidents, the argument may be made that transborder access to data may be justified as a countermeasure if a State does not meet its obligations of investigation (and the other conditions for lawful countermeasures are met).\n## V. Overall Assessment To conclude, the legal obligations of States before, during, and after a cyber security incident can be summarised in two final points: ⁵⁵ Council of Europe, Explanatory Report to the Convention on Cybercrime, para. 293, available at: https://rm.coe.int/CoERMPublicCommonSearchServices/DisplayDCTMContent?documentId=09000016800ce5b (accessed on 6 November 2015).

It competes with other notions such as ‘cyber warfare’, ‘cyber terrorism’, ‘cyber conflict’, ‘cyber threat’, ‘cyber crime’, or ‘cyber attack’.³ Some of these terms go along with certain strategies to ensure cyber security:⁴ ‘Cyber crime’ suggests a criminal law approach, ‘cyber warfare’ obviously alludes to use of force and international humanitarian law, etc.\n\n‘Cyber security incident’ may cover incidents as different as the distributed denial of service attack (DDoS) on the Estonian public computer system in 2007,⁵ the Stuxnet worm, which was apparently specifically designed for halting the Iranian nuclear programme,⁶ the hacking of computer systems of private companies for the purpose of industrial espionage and other cases of internet torts,⁷ hacktivist actions for the promotion of political ideas,⁸ etc. One could even include the military dimension under the label of ‘cyber security incident’.

In order to further clarify the notion of ‘cyber security incident’, it is helpful to look at the Convention on Cybercrime (Budapest Convention).¹⁰ ## C. The CoE Convention on Cybercrime (Budapest Convention) A few words concerning the Budapest Convention are in place by way of introduction: The Convention is the most comprehensive binding international document relating to cyber security.¹¹ Currently the Budapest Convention has 47 parties, among them several States who are not members of the Council of Europe (USA, Japan, Australia, and the Dominican Republic). There are further non-European signatories which have not yet ratified the Convention (Canada and South Africa). The Convention follows a criminal law approach and seeks to harmonise national laws by defining certain computer-related offences and setting minimum standards for the methods of their investigation and concerning the cooperation between States.¹² The definition covers offences against the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of computer-related data and systems (Articles 2–6 Budapest Convention), computer-related offences (forgery and fraud, Articles 7 and 8 Budapest Convention), content-related offences (child pornography, Article 9 Budapest Convention), and finally offences relating to infringements of copyright and related rights (Article 10 Budapest Convention).\n⁹ Charter of the United Nations, 26 June 1945, UNCIO 15, 335 (UN Charter).\n¹⁰ See supra, note 1. For a recent account of the Convention see Sophie Kwasny, Lutte contre la cybercriminalité et respect des droits de l'homme: Les instruments du Conseil de l'Europe, in: Société Française Pour le Droit International (ed.), Internet et le droit international: Colloque de Rouen (2014), 339.\n¹¹ See e.g. Paul Rosenzweig, International Law and Private Actor Active Cyber Defensive Measures, Stanford Journal of International Law 50 (2014), 103, 108; Hathaway et al. (note 3), 862.\n¹² For an analysis see Michael A. Vatis, The Council of Europe Convention on Cyber Crime, in: National Research Council (ed.), Proceedings of a Workshop on Deterring Cyber-Attacks: Informing Strategies and Developing Options for U.S. Policy (2010), 207; Robert Uerpmann-Wittzack, Internet-völkerrecht, Archiv des Völkerrechts 47 (2009), 261, 269–270.\nOBLIGATIONS OF STATES 71 Due to its criminal law approach, the Budapest Convention includes issues which are not related to inter-State security or to obligations incumbent upon States to ensure that their territories are not used for purposes which are harmful to other States. A more limited approach is therefore warranted for the purposes of this contribution. Accordingly, I propose to limit the notion of ‘cyber security incident’ to those crimes which relate to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of computer data and systems. A cyber security incident thus occurs whenever computers or computer systems are illegally accessed or destroyed or when data are illegally intercepted, deleted, or altered.\n\n---\n\n## ## C. Precautionary Principle A similar scepticism relates to the precautionary principle, which would be the most obvious candidate for imposing preventive action. Indeed, the precautionary ³⁴ See the commentary to Art. 3 Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm, para. 11: “The standard of due diligence against which the conduct of the State of origin should be examined is that which is generally considered to be appropriate and proportional to the degree of risk of transboundary harm in the particular instance. For example, activities which may be considered ultrahazardous require a much higher standard of care in designing policies and a much higher degree of vigour on the part of the State to enforce them. Issues such as the size of the operation; its location, special climate conditions, materials used in the activity, and whether the conclusions drawn from the application of these factors in a specific case are reasonable, are among the factors to be considered in determining the due diligence requirement in each instance. What would be considered a reasonable standard of care or due diligence may change with time; what might be considered an appropriate and reasonable procedure, standard or rule at one point in time may not be considered as such at some point in the future. Hence, due diligence in ensuring safety requires a State to keep abreast of technological changes and scientific developments” (II.C, Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities, with Commentaries (2001), Report on the Work of its 53rd Session, UN Doc. A/56/10 (2001), 377); see also the definition of “risk of causing significant transboundary harm” in Art. 2 Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm: “The definition refers to two types of activities under these articles. One is where there is a low probability of causing disastrous harm. This is normally the characteristic of ultrahazardous activities. The other one is where there is a high probability of causing significant harm. This includes activities which have a high probability of causing harm which, while not disastrous, is still significant. But it would exclude activities where there is a very low probability of causing significant transboundary harm.” (ibid., commentary para. 3).\n\n³⁵ Beyerlin/Marauhn (note 32), 43.\n³⁶ For a discussion of the due diligence standard’s applicability in cyberspace regulation (with reference to the ‘duty of prevention’) see also Pirker (note 1), 206–209.\nOBLIGATIONS OF STATES 77 principle has assumed a prominent place in modern international law.³⁷ Although its legal basis in customary law is still being questioned,³⁸ there are clear indications to the contrary, notably regarding environmental impact assessments. The requirement to undertake an environmental impact assessment has been considered to be rooted in customary international law by several international decisions. The most prominent among them is the *Pulp Mills* case of the ICJ where the Court held that [...] it may now be considered a requirement under general international law to undertake an environmental impact assessment where there is a risk that the proposed industrial activity may have a significant adverse impact in a transboundary context [...].³⁹ Similar approaches were taken by arbitral tribunals in the *Iron Rhine Arbitration*⁴⁰ and the *Indus Waters Project*.⁴¹ It may therefore be assumed that at least in form of an environmental impact assessment the precautionary principle has entered general international law.\n³⁷ Jonathan B. Wiener, *Precaution*, in: Daniel Bodansky/Jutta Brunnée/Ellen Hey (eds.), Oxford Handbook on International Environmental Law (2007), 597, 599.\n³⁸ See *Thilo Marauhn*, *Customary Rules of International Environmental Law: Can they Provide Guidance for Developing a Peacetime Regime for Cyberspace?*, in: *Ziolkowski* (ed.) (note 1), 465, 474–476, taking a critical stance on the precautionary principle’s prospects for application in cyber contexts.\n³⁹ ICJ, *Case Concerning Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay* (Argentina v. Uruguay), Judgment of 20 April 2010, ICJ Reports 2010, 14, para. 204.\n⁴⁰ *Arbitration Regarding the Iron Rhine (‘Ijzeren Rijn’) Railway* (Belgium, The Netherlands), Arbitral Award of 24 May 2005, RIAA XXVII, para. 59: “Environmental law and the law on development stand not as alternatives but as mutually reinforcing, integral concepts, which require that where development may cause significant harm to the environment there is a duty to prevent, or at least mitigate, such harm (see paragraph 222). This duty, in the opinion of the Tribunal, has now become a principle of general international law”.\n⁴¹ *The Indus Waters Kishenganga Arbitration* (Pakistan, India), Partial Award of 18 February 2013, paras. 449 et seq., available at: http://www.pca-cpa.org/PK-IN%2020130218%20Partial%20Award%2018ba.pdf?fil_id=2101 (accessed on 11 November 2015): “There is no doubt that States are required under contemporary customary international law to take environmental protection into consideration when planning and developing projects that may cause injury to a bordering State. Since the time of Trail Smelter, a series of international conventions, declarations and judicial and arbitral decisions have addressed the need to manage natural resources in a sustainable manner. In particular, the International Court of Justice expounded upon the principle of ‘sustainable development’ in *Gabcikovo-Nagymaros*, referring to the ‘need to reconcile economic development with protection of the environment.’ Applied to large-scale construction projects, the principle of sustainable development translates, as the International Court of Justice recently put it in *Pulp Mills*, into ‘a requirement under general international law to undertake an environmental impact assessment where there is a risk that the proposed industrial activity may have a significant adverse impact in a transboundary context, in particular, on a shared resource’” (footnotes omitted).\nGERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015 Could one transfer the concept into the cyber world in form of a ‘cyber impact assessment’ requirement?⁴² There are strong arguments against such a transposition. A starting point is that the environmental impact assessment relates to large industrial projects, which are considered to go along with specific risks for the environment. The possible sources of cyber security incidents cannot be narrowed down according to the scale of the activity. Each and every single computer, notebook, tablet, or smartphone could be the source of a cyber security incident. Hence, preventive cyber impact assessment would practically have to cover all activities in the internet. This would be incompatible with requirements of freedom of expression and communication and thus certainly go beyond what could be seen as part of general international law.",

    "# Obligations of States Before, During, and After a Cyber Security Incident\n\nCHRISTIAN WALTER*\n\nABSTRACT: The article is based on the assumption that States and the principle of territoriality will continue to be decisive factors in international law in the digital age. On the basis of this assumption, the author inquires into possible principles and rules established in general international law which could be relied on in order to address cyber security incidents, i.e. inter-State conflicts relating to cyberspace which remain below the threshold of the notions of use of force or armed conflict.\n\nRelying mainly on principles established in international environmental law, it is argued that the principle of good neighbourliness is the most promising candidate for developing obligations of cooperation and assistance in dealing with malicious cyber activities. However, one crucial difference between hazardous activities relating to the environment and threats in cyberspace is spelled out: In contrast to activities with potential dangers for the environment, with regard to the internet it is impossible to distinguish 'hazardous' activities from non-hazardous activities. For this reason it is impossible to establish thresholds or activities in cyberspace which could serve as triggers for preventive obligations. As a consequence, the focus must be laid on obligations of cooperation and assistance during and after a cyber security incident, rather than at the preventive stage.\n\nKEYWORDS: Cyber Security, Good Neighbourliness, Corfu Channel Case, Burden of Proof, Prevention, Obligations of Cooperation\n\n## I. Introduction\n\nThe internet presents many challenges to international law. Its virtual character is considered to put into question the principle of territoriality which in many areas is fundamental to international law as it currently stands. The rapidity of cyber activity requires swift and often coordinated if not collective action by more than one State.\n\n* Professor for Public and Public International Law, Institute for International Law, Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Munich.",
    "GERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58 · 2015\n\nFinally, private actors play an important role. This means, on the one side, that issues of State responsibility for private activities have to be addressed, and on the other, that human rights issues must be taken into account. All of this does not fit easily into the inter-State paradigm of mutual obligations between States. The following considerations thus necessarily are of a preliminary, explorative character.\n\n## II. General Assumptions\n\n## A. Concerning the Role of States\n\nA first general assumption relates to the role of States in regulating the internet. In contrast to some positions in literature, in the following the internet is not viewed as a legal space which is distinct from the territory of States and thus subject to its own, independent legal regime. The internet certainly has an important transnational dimension, but that does not mean that it is intrinsically transnational and cannot be made subject to regulations from individual States. Rather, the following considerations are based on a territorial approach according to which ‘the Internet’ is viewed as being – at least in most parts – covered by the authority of the State on whose territory a specific activity in question takes place, i.e. where a person physically conducts his or her malicious activity or where a server or computer on which the activity takes place is located.¹\n\nSpecific problems may arise in the context of data which move frequently between different servers and different locations. Given the frequency and rapidity with which the location of data may be changed, the situation of such data has been described as a “loss of location”.² However, these specific problems of ‘data in the cloud(s)’ may\n\n¹ Eneken Tikk, Ten Rules for Cyber Security, Survival: Global Politics and Strategy 53 (2011), 119, 121; Johann-Christoph Woltag, Computer Network Operations Below the Level of Armed Force, European Society of International Law (ESIL) Conference Paper No. 1/2011, 12, available via: http://www.esil-sedi.eu/node/697 (accessed on 31 October 2015); Benedikt Pirker, Territorial Integrity and the Challenges of Cyberspace, in: Katharina Ziolkowski (ed.), Peacetime Regime for State Activities in Cyberspace (2013), 189, 193 et seq. For a similar approach see Art. 22 (1)(a)–(c) Convention on Cybercrime, 23 November 2001, ETS No. 185 (Budapest Convention); specific problems of activities in internationalised territories such as the high seas are left aside, given their presumably small practical relevance.\n\n² Council of Europe, Economic Crime Division, Cloud Computing and Cybercrime Investigations: Territoriality vs. the Power of Disposal?, Discussion Paper, 31 August 2010, available at: rm.coe.int/",

It competes with other notions such as ‘cyber warfare’, ‘cyber terrorism’, ‘cyber conflict’, ‘cyber threat’, ‘cyber crime’, or ‘cyber attack’.³ Some of these terms go along with certain strategies to ensure cyber security:⁴ ‘Cyber crime’ suggests a criminal law approach, ‘cyber warfare’ obviously alludes to use of force and international humanitarian law, etc.\n\n‘Cyber security incident’ may cover incidents as different as the distributed denial of service attack (DDoS) on the Estonian public computer system in 2007,⁵ the Stuxnet worm, which was apparently specifically designed for halting the Iranian nuclear programme,⁶ the hacking of computer systems of private companies for the purpose of industrial espionage and other cases of internet torts,⁷ hacktivist actions for the promotion of political ideas,⁸ etc. One could even include the military dimension under the label of ‘cyber security incident’.

In order to further clarify the notion of ‘cyber security incident’, it is helpful to look at the Convention on Cybercrime (Budapest Convention).¹⁰\n\n## C. The CoE Convention on Cybercrime (Budapest Convention)\n\nA few words concerning the Budapest Convention are in place by way of introduction: The Convention is the most comprehensive binding international document relating to cyber security.¹¹ Currently the Budapest Convention has 47 parties, among them several States who are not members of the Council of Europe (USA, Japan, Australia, and the Dominican Republic). There are further non-European signatories which have not yet ratified the Convention (Canada and South Africa). The Convention follows a criminal law approach and seeks to harmonise national laws by defining certain computer-related offences and setting minimum standards for the methods of their investigation and concerning the cooperation between States.¹²\n\nThe definition covers offences against the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of computer-related data and systems (Articles 2–6 Budapest Convention), computer-related offences (forgery and fraud, Articles 7 and 8 Budapest Convention), content-related offences (child pornography, Article 9 Budapest Convention), and finally offences relating to infringements of copyright and related rights (Article 10 Budapest Convention).\n\n⁹ Charter of the United Nations, 26 June 1945, UNCIO 15, 335 (UN Charter).\n\n¹⁰ See supra, note 1.

    "OBLIGATIONS OF STATES 71\n\nDue to its criminal law approach, the Budapest Convention includes issues which are not related to inter-State security or to obligations incumbent upon States to ensure that their territories are not used for purposes which are harmful to other States. A more limited approach is therefore warranted for the purposes of this contribution. Accordingly, I propose to limit the notion of ‘cyber security incident’ to those crimes which relate to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of computer data and systems. A cyber security incident thus occurs whenever computers or computer systems are illegally accessed or destroyed or when data are illegally intercepted, deleted, or altered.\n\n## III. General Obligations of Prevention\n\nThe first phase of possible obligations relates to the situation prior to a cyber security incident. In this phase obligations of prevention are of interest. These aspects will be dealt with first (III.). In a second step obligations of cooperation and information will be dealt with (IV.). These obligations are mostly relevant during or after a cyber security incident has occurred.\n\n## A. Principle of Non-Intervention\n\nThe most fundamental principle applicable is the principle of non-intervention. According to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) it is “part and parcel of customary international law”.¹³ When a State uses the internet in order to destabilise another country, this constitutes a violation of the principle of non-intervention. Similarly, cyber-based activities of organs of one State on computers situated in another country or relating to parts of the web situated in another country would infringe upon the latter country’s sovereignty.\n\nIn this area, issues such as attribution, standards of proof, etc. are more important than the substantive law, which is quite clear. In that regard, it is necessary to distinguish between computers and computer systems belonging to the government and\n\n¹³ International Court of Justice (ICJ), *Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua* (Nicaragua v.

Computers belonging to the government may be presumed to be controlled by the government. Ideas for distributing responsibility under such circumstances may be borrowed from the jurisprudence and practice of human rights bodies regarding persons who are in complete control of State agents.\n\nThe European Court of Human Rights, for instance, argues as follows:\n\nWhere the events in issue lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of persons within their control in custody, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries and death occurring during such detention. Indeed, the burden of proof may be regarded as resting on the authorities to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation.^[14]^\n\nThe factor of exclusive control was also taken into consideration by the ICJ in developing its standard of proof in the Corfu Channel case:\n\n[...] the fact of this exclusive territorial control exercised by a State within its frontiers has a bearing upon the methods of proof available to establish the knowledge of that State as to such events. By reason of this exclusive control, the other State, the victim of a breach of international law, is often unable to furnish direct proof of facts giving rise to responsibility. Such a State should be allowed a more liberal recourse to inferences of fact and circumstantial evidence. This indirect evidence is admitted in all systems of law, and its use is recognized by international decisions. It must be regarded as of special weight when it is based on a series of facts linked together and leading logically to a single conclusion.^[15]^\n\nActivities on computers owned by the government are “within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities.” Hence, the following assumption may be made: Where a malicious cyber activity creating a cyber security incident can be traced back to a government computer or computer system, the activity may be attributed to the government, unless it provides a satisfactory and convincing explanation that the system was externally used (i.e. has been hacked by someone else).^[16]^\n\n^[14] European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR), Salman v.

    "OBLIGATIONS OF STATES 73\n\nBy contrast, activities emanating from private computers can only be attributed to the government on the basis of the general principle laid down in Article 8 Articles on State Responsibility.¹⁷ Hence, it is necessary to establish that the activity in question was executed “on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct.” Usually it will be impossible to meet this standard.¹⁸ It is therefore necessary to ask whether there are further obligations of control or prevention which include activities of private actors.\n\n## B. No-Harm Principle\n\nIn the *Corfu Channel* case the ICJ assumed a general duty to prevent harm. The Court ruled on a general principle to prevent harm as one of the bases for an Albanian duty to warn the British government: “[...] every State’s obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States.”¹⁹\n\nThe general principle has been developed in more detail in the area of international environmental law where good neighbourliness and a duty to prevent harm are considered to be part of customary law.²⁰ The main sources for this principle are the famous *Trail Smelter* arbitration²¹ and Principle 21 Stockholm Declaration/Principle 2 Rio Declaration.²²\n\n---\n\n¹⁷ International Law Commission (ILC), Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, GAOR, 56th Sess., Suppl. 10, 43 et seq.\n\n¹⁸ Cf. also Terry D.

    "GERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58 · 2015\n\nThese principles allow for the inclusion of harm caused by private actors.²³ In the *Corfu Channel* case mere knowledge by the Albanian authorities of the danger was sufficient, and in the *Trail Smelter* case the pollution emanated from a private plant. Thus, the principles of good neighbourliness and the duty to prevent harm extend the responsibility of States for private action beyond the strict criteria of Article 8 Articles on State Responsibility. To put the issue more generally: Responsibility of States for private action is not only caused by criteria of attribution, i.e. within the law of State responsibility, but also by the character of the primary obligations of States. Obligations of control and surveillance entail an indirect responsibility for private action if they are not respected. This reflects that there is an interaction in the law of State responsibility between the issue of attribution on the one side and the scope of the obligation of the State on the other.²⁴ In terms of the practical outcome, obligations of surveillance and control may thus constitute a substitute for the attribution of private action to a State.\n\nThe consequences which flow from the overall responsibility of States for harmful activities on their territory are, however, mitigated to some extent by additional criteria.\n\nFirst, the *Corfu Channel* formula requires “knowledge” on part of the State concerned. While the ICJ could operate with certain assumptions regarding the overall control of the territorial waters,²⁵ such an overall control certainly cannot be assumed with respect to any cyber activity on the territory of a given State.²⁶ Hence, the requirement of “knowledge” of the harmful activity will only be met in rare cases.\n\non the Human Environment, UN Doc.

    "OBLIGATIONS OF STATES 75\n\nSecondly, the Trail Smelter principle²⁷ has originally been restricted in its scope by the requirement of “serious consequence” being established by “clear and convincing evidence”. It does not seem to be excluded, however, that these criteria are met in the context of cyber security incidents. For example, it has been argued that the DDoS attack on Estonia in 2007 constituted a case of “serious consequence”.²⁸ Irrespective of that it is today mostly recognised that international environmental law has developed beyond the Trail Smelter requirements.²⁹ Thus, the no-harm rule as it currently stands in customary international law only requires a certain *de minimis* threshold to be fulfilled³⁰ and the precautionary principle may be considered to have alleviated the strict Trail Smelter standard of proof.³¹\n\nFinally, the Trail Smelter principle is further mitigated by the requirement of due diligence.³² Today “there is a clear consensus that although the no-harm principle does not say so explicitly, a State can only breach the principle if it fails to act with due diligence.”³³ According to the ILC in its Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities (Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm) both the magnitude and the probability of harm are to be taken\n\n²⁷ For further elaboration on this see Russell A.

Hence, preventive action by States is both factually and legally considerably limited.\n\n## C. Precautionary Principle\n\nA similar scepticism relates to the precautionary principle, which would be the most obvious candidate for imposing preventive action. Indeed, the precautionary\n\n³⁴ See the commentary to Art. 3 Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm, para. 11: “The standard of due diligence against which the conduct of the State of origin should be examined is that which is generally considered to be appropriate and proportional to the degree of risk of transboundary harm in the particular instance. For example, activities which may be considered ultrahazardous require a much higher standard of care in designing policies and a much higher degree of vigour on the part of the State to enforce them. Issues such as the size of the operation; its location, special climate conditions, materials used in the activity, and whether the conclusions drawn from the application of these factors in a specific case are reasonable, are among the factors to be considered in determining the due diligence requirement in each instance. What would be considered a reasonable standard of care or due diligence may change with time; what might be considered an appropriate and reasonable procedure, standard or rule at one point in time may not be considered as such at some point in the future. Hence, due diligence in ensuring safety requires a State to keep abreast of technological changes and scientific developments” (II.C, Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities, with Commentaries (2001), Report on the Work of its 53rd Session, UN Doc. A/56/10 (2001), 377); see also the definition of “risk of causing significant transboundary harm” in Art. 2 Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm: “The definition refers to two types of activities under these articles. One is where there is a low probability of causing disastrous harm. This is normally the characteristic of ultrahazardous activities. The other one is where there is a high probability of causing significant harm. This includes activities which have a high probability of causing harm which, while not disastrous, is still significant. But it would exclude activities where there is a very low probability of causing significant transboundary harm.” (ibid., commentary para. 3).\n\n³⁵ Beyerlin/Marauhn (note 32), 43.\n\n³⁶ For a discussion of the due diligence standard’s applicability in cyberspace regulation (with reference to the ‘duty of prevention’) see also Pirker (note 1), 206–209.",

The requirement to undertake an environmental impact assessment has been considered to be rooted in customary international law by several international decisions. The most prominent among them is the *Pulp Mills* case of the ICJ where the Court held that\n\n[...] it may now be considered a requirement under general international law to undertake an environmental impact assessment where there is a risk that the proposed industrial activity may have a significant adverse impact in a transboundary context [...].³⁹\n\nSimilar approaches were taken by arbitral tribunals in the *Iron Rhine Arbitration*⁴⁰ and the *Indus Waters Project*.⁴¹ It may therefore be assumed that at least in form of an environmental impact assessment the precautionary principle has entered general international law.\n\n³⁷ Jonathan B. Wiener, *Precaution*, in: Daniel Bodansky/Jutta Brunnée/Ellen Hey (eds.), Oxford Handbook on International Environmental Law (2007), 597, 599.\n\n³⁸ See *Thilo Marauhn*, *Customary Rules of International Environmental Law: Can they Provide Guidance for Developing a Peacetime Regime for Cyberspace?*, in: *Ziolkowski* (ed.) (note 1), 465, 474–476, taking a critical stance on the precautionary principle’s prospects for application in cyber contexts.\n\n³⁹ ICJ, *Case Concerning Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay* (Argentina v. Uruguay), Judgment of 20 April 2010, ICJ Reports 2010, 14, para. 204.\n\n⁴⁰ *Arbitration Regarding the Iron Rhine (‘Ijzeren Rijn’) Railway* (Belgium, The Netherlands), Arbitral Award of 24 May 2005, RIAA XXVII, para. 59: “Environmental law and the law on development stand not as alternatives but as mutually reinforcing, integral concepts, which require that where development may cause significant harm to the environment there is a duty to prevent, or at least mitigate, such harm (see paragraph 222). This duty, in the opinion of the Tribunal, has now become a principle of general international law”.\n\n⁴¹ *The Indus Waters Kishenganga Arbitration* (Pakistan, India), Partial Award of 18 February 2013, paras. 449 et seq., available at: http://www.pca-cpa.org/PK-IN%2020130218%20Partial%20Award%2018ba.pdf?fil_id=2101 (accessed on 11 November 2015): “There is no doubt that States are required under contemporary customary international law to take environmental protection into consideration when planning and developing projects that may cause injury to a bordering State. Since the time of Trail Smelter, a series of international conventions, declarations and judicial and arbitral decisions have addressed the need to manage natural resources in a sustainable manner. In particular, the International Court of Justice expounded upon the principle of ‘sustainable development’ in *Gabcikovo-Nagymaros*, referring to the ‘need to reconcile economic development with protection of the environment.’ Applied to large-scale construction projects, the principle of sustainable development translates, as the International Court of Justice recently put it in *Pulp Mills*, into ‘a requirement under general international law to undertake an environmental impact assessment where there is a risk that the proposed industrial activity may have a significant adverse impact in a transboundary context, in particular, on a shared resource’” (footnotes omitted).",
    "GERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\n\nCould one transfer the concept into the cyber world in form of a ‘cyber impact assessment’ requirement?⁴² There are strong arguments against such a transposition. A starting point is that the environmental impact assessment relates to large industrial projects, which are considered to go along with specific risks for the environment. The possible sources of cyber security incidents cannot be narrowed down according to the scale of the activity. Each and every single computer, notebook, tablet, or smartphone could be the source of a cyber security incident. Hence, preventive cyber impact assessment would practically have to cover all activities in the internet. This would be incompatible with requirements of freedom of expression and communication and thus certainly go beyond what could be seen as part of general international law.\n\n## D. Summary Regarding Prevention\n\nIn sum, the preventive obligations of States in the absence of concrete cyber security incidents remain rather limited. It is impossible to postulate a general obligation to preventively monitor cyber activities which are linked to the territory of a given State. Therefore, preventive obligations are basically limited to a prohibition to actively engage in malicious cyber activity and to respect due diligence standards regarding computers and systems which are under the control of the State.\n\n## IV. Procedural Obligations of Cooperation and Information (During and After a Cyber Security Incident)\n\nDoes that situation change during or after a cyber security incident?\n\n## A. Good Neighbourliness as a General Source\n\nThis article has already referred to the principle of good neighbourliness as a general source of cooperation and information. Indeed, Article 74 UN Charter codi\n\n⁴² On the transferability of international environmental law rules to cyberspace activities see generally Marauhn (note 38), 481–482.",
    "OBLIGATIONS OF STATES 79\n\nfies the principle of good neighbourliness regarding all matters of social, economic, and commercial matters. Based on the ICJ’s decision in the *Haya de la Torre* case,⁴³ the legal character of the principle of good neighbourliness is sometimes questioned.⁴⁴ The better view, however, rests its analysis on the frequent reference to the principle in many international treaties and concludes on a ‘hard-law content’ of the principle.⁴⁵ Irrespective of its hard law content, two problems remain when the concept of good neighbourliness is to be applied in the context of cyber security. The first relates to geographic proximity and the second to concrete obligations to be derived from the concept.\n\nUsually a certain geographic proximity of the States is required when the principle of good neighbourliness is invoked. It should be noted, however, that the United Nations General Assembly, already in 1991 and outside the context of the world wide web, extended the notion of good neighbourliness to all States of the international community “whether or not they are contiguous”.⁴⁶ Even if this approach is considered too far-reaching in the general context of all inter-State relations, a good point for universal neighbourliness may be made as far as relations through the internet are concerned. Effects of cyber activities are not limited to adjacent States but can be produced anywhere. Therefore, looked at from the perspective of its purpose, *i.e.* the obligations to duly take into account possible adverse effects on a neighbouring country, transferring the principle of good neighbourliness to the world wide web leads to its application in all inter-State relations, irrespective of the geographical location of the States concerned.\n\nAs far as concrete obligations under the principle of good neighbourliness are concerned, it is again international environmental law which provides for the best comparison. The most broadly accepted obligation concerns an obligation of information in case of emergency. Apart from that, there exist also general obligations of information, consultation, and notification in the absence of emergency situations.\n\n⁴³ ICJ, *Haya de la Torre* (Colombia *v.* Peru), Judgment of 13 June 1951, ICJ Reports 1951, 71.\n\n⁴⁴ See e.g. *Leland M. Goodrich/Edvard Hambro/Anne Patricia Simons*, Charter of the United Nations: Commentary and Documents (3rd ed. 1969), 463.\n\n⁴⁵ *Laurence Boisson de Chazournes/Danio Campanelli*, Neighbour States, MPEPIL, December 2006, para. 20, available *via*: http://www.mpepil.com (accessed on 8 June 2015); *Ulrich Fastenrath*, Article 74, in: Bruno Simma *et al.* (eds.), UN Charter Commentary (3rd ed. 2012), 1840, MN 2.\n\n⁴⁶ GA Res. 46/92 of 9 December 1991.",
    "GERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58·2015\n\n## B. Emergency Information\n\nThere is a clear customary duty to inform in cases of emergency. Evidence of this duty is – again – the Corfu Channel case where the ICJ considered Albania under an obligation to warn the British warship of the mines, similar obligations of warning are contained in a number of treaties relating to the environment.⁴⁷ One may also point to duties of information concerning infections “in the real world”. Article 6 World Health Organization (WHO) International Health Regulations⁴⁸ requires States to\n\nnotify WHO, by the most efficient means of communication available, by way of the National IHR [International Health Regulations] Focal Point, and within 24 hours of assessment of public health information, of all events which may constitute a public health emergency of international concern within its territory [...] as well as any health measure implemented in response to those events.\n\nThus, in order to effectively combat their negative effects, virtual and real viruses may be treated alike.\n\nGiven the rapid connections via the internet, this information duty in cases of emergency may seem of limited value. On the other hand, one of the last epidemic attacks, the so-called conficker worm which primarily attacked Microsoft Windows operating systems, lasted over a period from 2008 to 2010, infecting among other institutions the German Bundeswehr, the French Navy, and the Greater Manchester Police.⁴⁹ During such a prolonged period, warning not only by the public concerned but also by States may help limiting the consequences.\n\n## C. Information, Consultation, and Notification Beyond Emergency Situations\n\nObligations from the principle of good neighbourliness which relate to activities involving a risk of harm are not limited to the ex ante situation, i.e. before the activity\n\n⁴⁷ For detailed references see *Birnie/Boyle/Redgwell* (note 20), 182 et seq.\n\n⁴⁸ Cf.

    "OBLIGATIONS OF STATES 81\n\nis started. This is explicitly spelled out in the ILC Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm.⁵⁰ Article 12 Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm contains a continuous obligation to exchange information.⁵¹ It would seem strange indeed if the obligations concerning information and consultation concerning environmental protection were to end once the project has started. Seen from this perspective, the continued duty to consult and inform once a project has started is basically a prolongation of the precautionary approach which creates obligations of prevention.\n\nAgainst this background one might be tempted to assume that – when transposed to the issue of cyber security incidents – a continued duty to consult and to inform encounters the same problems which have been highlighted concerning preventive action. However, there is an important factual difference which leads to a different analysis: At the preventive stage, *i.e.* prior to a concrete cyber security incident, it is not possible to limit the obligations to specific activities which may be considered particularly dangerous. By contrast, during or after a cyber security incident it is not unlikely that the State or States where the incident occurred or caused harmful consequences are able to narrow down possible sources and to give information on them. Under such circumstances the duty to provide information and to consult acquires a new and sufficiently specific content. Instead of being related to potentially all activities in the world wide web emanating from a specific country, the duty relates to activities which have proved harmful and thus present characteristics which allow them to be distinguished from other harmless activities. Under such circumstances it seems appropriate to assume a duty of cooperation on the part of the State where the activity allegedly emanated from and to oblige this State to share any information on the matter which is available to its authorities. In other words: While under the principle of good neighbourliness in the real world the size of a certain activity and the risks attached to it trigger general obligations of cooperation, in the cyber world it is the occurrence of a specific cyber security incident which triggers specific obligations of cooperation.\n\n⁵⁰ See *supra*, note 34.\n\n⁵¹ “While the activity is being carried out, the States concerned shall exchange in a timely manner all available information concerning that activity relevant to preventing significant transboundary harm or at any event minimizing the risk thereof. Such an exchange of information shall continue until such time as the States concerned consider it appropriate even after the activity is terminated”.",
    "GERMAN YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 58 · 2015\n\nIn this context the question arises whether a certain standard of probability must be shown by the requesting State. The standard is not easy to circumscribe. It is certainly not enough if the source of the malicious activity is merely asserted. On the other hand, demanding full proof would most probably be a standard which is difficult to meet. While it is true that the ICJ in the *Oil Platforms* case demanded full proof by the United States (US) that the missile attack against their vessels constituted an armed attack by Iran on the US, which claimed to have reacted in self-defence,⁵² there is a decisive difference in the situation addressed here: The *Oil Platforms* case was about the justification of an otherwise unlawful use of force against another State. In the current context obligations of investigation and information are at issue. In other words: We are not talking about the legality of cross-border activity by one State against another, but about obligations of a State arising out of a specific situation over which it has at least territorial control. On the basis of the *Corfu Channel* case the standard of proof is lower:\n\nBy reason of this exclusive control, the other State, the victim of a breach of international law, is often unable to furnish direct proof of facts giving rise to responsibility. Such a State should be allowed a more liberal recourse to inferences of fact and circumstantial evidence. This indirect evidence is admitted in all systems of law, and its use is recognized by international decisions. It must be regarded as of special weight when it is based on a series of facts linked together and leading logically to a single conclusion.⁵³\n\n## D. Cooperation in Investigation and Prosecution\n\nAnother issue concerns obligations of investigation and prosecution. In order to be clear on the previous point of information and cooperation: The obligation to share information can only relate to information which is already available to the authorities. A certainly more far-reaching obligation would concern investigation and collection of information which is *not yet available*. It is to this point that I now want to turn.\n\n⁵² ICJ, *Case Concerning Oil Platforms* (Islamic Republic of Iran v. United States of America), Judgment of 6 November 2003, ICJ Reports 2003, 161, paras. 57 et seq.\n\n⁵³ See *id.*, *Corfu Channel* (note 15), 18.",
    "OBLIGATIONS OF STATES 83\n\n## 1. The General Framework for International Criminal Cooperation\n\nUnder the general framework for international criminal cooperation there are only very limited generally applicable rules. Although the field is moving fast towards closer cooperation,⁵⁴ in the absence of specific treaty provisions mutual assistance in international criminal law is still dominated by traditional views on sovereignty which give the requested State broad discretion in whether at all, and if so under which conditions, it will meet a request for assistance.\n\nThe main tools which exist within the framework of international criminal cooperation concern requests for extradition and mutual assistance in other matters of criminal investigation, such as witnesses, evidence, etc. Regarding both institutions there are no general, but only specific obligations concerning either certain crimes (i.e. the application of the *aut dedere aut iudicare* principle to acts of terrorism) or the respective obligations are contained in specific treaties on mutual cooperation in criminal matters.\n\n## 2. Obligations Contained in the Budapest Convention\n\nThe most elaborate treaty relating to international criminal cooperation concerning crimes related to cyberspace is, again, the Budapest Convention. Apart from defining cyber crime offences, the Convention requires its parties to enact certain investigative procedures for the inquiry into cyber crimes: expedited preservation of stored computer data (Article 16 Budapest Convention), preservation and disclosure of traffic data (Article 17 Budapest Convention), search and seizure of stored computer data (Article 19 Budapest Convention), real-time collection of traffic data (Article 20 Budapest Convention), and, finally, the interception of content data (Article 21 Budapest Convention).\n\nIn its third part the Convention deals with international cooperation in the areas of extradition, mutual assistance, and establishment of permanent points of contact (Articles 23–35 Budapest Convention). These provisions explicitly take up obliga-\n\n⁵⁴ *Tim René Salomon*, Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters, MPEPIL, January 2013, paras. 36 *et seq.*, available via: http://www.mpepil.com (accessed on 8 June 2015).",

Hence the procedural obligations of the Convention apply as far as States parties of the Budapest Convention are concerned. Given the fact that the focus of this analysis rests on general international law, the obligations under the Budapest Convention will, however, not be looked into in more detail.\n\n## 3. Transposing Obligations of Investigation Developed in International Human Rights Adjudication\n\nAnother area of inspiration for obligations to investigate may be found in the jurisprudence of international human rights bodies relating to positive obligations of States in case of human rights violations. There is a clear and – it seems – widely accepted obligation to investigate in two groups of cases. The first has already been dealt with in the context of a reversal of the burden of proof, namely situations of complete control by the State (i.e. prisons and other institutions for detaining persons). On the basis of this jurisprudence it may be argued that an obligation to investigate arises where malicious cyber activity can be traced back to a computer or computer system controlled by another State. At first sight one might object that the situations of an individual human rights claim on the one side and inter-State obligations on the other are not compatible. There is, however, a common denominator which is the exclusive control of the State. In that regard, the two situations do not differ decisively. Hence, obligations of investigation may be assumed concerning computers and computer systems under the control of the government.\n\n## 4. Transborder Access to Data\n\nThe issue of transborder access to data has gained a lot of public attention in recent days. The Budapest Convention left the issue deliberately open. Article 32 Budapest",
    "OBLIGATIONS OF STATES\n\nConvention only regulates the easy cases of data which is publicly available (lit. a) and consent by the person who has the lawful authority to disclose the data (lit. b). One might be tempted to conclude that the express regulation of only these two instances *e contrario* precludes any other transborder access to data. However, the explanatory report excludes this argument by referring to Article 39 Budapest Convention according to which other obligations are neither created nor precluded.⁵⁵\n\nThe issue of transborder access to data is currently being discussed in the context of a possible Additional Protocol to the Budapest Convention. If my reading of the papers which are publicly available⁵⁶ is correct, there are a number of different proposals on the table. Discussing them would probably require a paper on its own.\n\nFor that reason I do not want to go into details of transborder access to data. I will limit my comments on this issue to one single point: If the analysis above is correct that under certain circumstances obligations of information and even of investigation may arise out of specific cyber security incidents, the argument may be made that transborder access to data may be justified as a countermeasure if a State does not meet its obligations of investigation (and the other conditions for lawful countermeasures are met).\n\n## V. Overall Assessment\n\nTo conclude, the legal obligations of States before, during, and after a cyber security incident can be summarised in two final points:\n\n1. All States are cyber neighbours. Therefore, in general international law the principle of good neighbourliness is the most promising candidate for developing obligations of cooperation and assistance in dealing with malicious cyber activities. The most important challenge consists in the fact that it is impossible to distin\n\n⁵⁵ Council of Europe, Explanatory Report to the Convention on Cybercrime, para. 293, available at: https://rm.coe.int/CoERMPublicCommonSearchServices/DisplayDCTMContent?documentId=09000016800ce5b (accessed on 6 November 2015).

On the basis of this assumption, the author inquires into possible principles and rules established in general international law which could be relied on in order to address cyber security incidents, i.e. inter-State conflicts relating to cyberspace which remain below the threshold of the notions of use of force or armed conflict.",
