Introduction\nThe Law of Armed Conflict (“LOAC”) has evolved over the past century and a half to protect civilians from the harms caused by war as well as to put all parties on notice as to their expected conduct. Civilians, like any other group, are not prohibited from directly participating in hostilities, but they lose their protection from being directly targeted for such time as they chose to do so.¹ This protection for civilians is easier understood as it is applied to the physical domain, for which it was created. The cyber domain is vastly different. Accordingly, civilians and States who are party to international armed conflicts are left to apply their own understanding of how LOAC principles should be applied to the cyber domain.\nThe difference of interpretation by civilians and parties to armed conflict could leave civilians overly exposed to direct attack and parties accountable for war crimes. This is especially true for non-state-affiliated civilians conducting cyber hostilities against a State that is party to an armed conflict. The differentiation between state-affiliated and non-state-affiliated civilians matters, because state-affiliated civilians should understand they may be injured or killed based on their work alongside and their proximity to armed forces. Thus, they are likely on notice that they may be directly targeted if directly participating in hostilities as well as considered collateral damage during a legal attack by an enemy State. In addition, civilians may open themselves up to an extended period of time during which they may be directly targeted based on the type of cyber operation they conduct.\nVarying views support the notion that civilians intermittently participating directly in hostilities may be targeted throughout a linked-together period of participation. Further, if a civilian were to launch against a State a cyber operation that activates at a set point in the future or after a forecasted event, the State could possibly treat the civilian as directly participating in hostilities long after the civilian actually initiated and participated in the cyber operation. This delayed direct targeting of the civilian can happen either because the State is unaware of exactly when the cyber operation was launched against it or because it interprets its\n¹ Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts, June 8, 1977, 110 Stat. 2104, 1125 U.N.T.S. 51 [hereinafter Protocol I].\n2017 THE TARGETING OF NON-STATE-AFFILIATED CIVILIANS 1015\nresponse as warranted under LOAC.\nAlong with opening themselves up to being directly targeted, civilians participating in cyber hostilities may also face domestic criminal law exposure for their cyber hostilities. States that are party to an armed conflict could seek to lawfully target the civilian rather than await a domestic law prosecution. A possible solution to civilians being overly exposed to direct attack for their decision to directly participate in cyber hostilities could come from the Model Penal Code’s view of renouncing one’s role and thwarting the overall success of the act. Under this theory, a civilian could make the enemy State aware of the civilian’s plot to conduct an ongoing cyber operation against the State in an effort to absolve the civilian of being targeted in the future. However, these civilians may still face domestic criminal law repercussions for doing so.\n## II. The Treatment of Civilians in Traditional Warfare\nWhether it is their own loss of life or injury, the loss or injury of a relative, or the collateral damage of their property, civilians always suffer during war. Accordingly, major nation states have been working together for over a century to address the way traditional wars are fought, and they have sought to add a sense of humanity and require discrimination in targeting. In 1949, major nation states acceded to the Fourth Geneva Convention, which was called “The Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War” and sought to protect noncombatants.²\nPrior to the Geneva Conventions, civilians were left to the mercy of the combatants and their beliefs as to sparing civilians.³ The Geneva Conventions codified what had been inching closer to customary law for decades.⁴ The movement in this direction can be seen by the Lieber Code, which sought to regulate war; and later the Declaration of St. Petersburg in 1868, which prohibited the use of specific weapons for humanitarian reasons.⁵ The\n² Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, Aug. 12, 1949, 110 Stat. 2104, 75 U.N.T.S. 287 [hereinafter Geneva Convention].\n³ See ANICÉE VAN ENGELAND, CIVILIAN OR COMBATANT?: A CHALLENGE FOR THE 21ST CENTURY ix-xix (2011).\n⁴ Id.\n⁵ Id. at 13–14.\n1016\nN.C. J. INT'L L.\n[Vol. XLII]\ninternational agreement formed at the 1874 Brussels Convention discussed laws and customs of war and provided that combatant forces are not granted unlimited power as to how to injure the enemy.⁶ This provision was later codified in the Hague Regulations of 1907, as was the general understanding of the need for discrimination between civilians and combatants.⁷ Additionally, the Hague Peace Conferences of 1899 and 1907 became the first internationally codified documents providing that civilians should not suffer from the effects of hostilities.⁸\n## A. Geneva Convention and the Additional Protocol\nThe Fourth Geneva Convention, which occurred in 1949, specifically sought to protect civilians during times of war.⁹ Under the Fourth Geneva Convention, persons taking no active part in the hostilities are to be treated humanely and without regard to their faith, sex, race, or religion.¹⁰ In addition, parties to the conflict are to establish neutral zones in regions of combat to shelter wounded and sick combatants and civilians taking no part in hostilities from the effects of war.¹¹ The wounded and the sick are specifically protected and should be provided particular care and respect.¹²\nIn addition to the Fourth Geneva Convention, the Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (“Additional Protocol I”) is a 1977 amendment to the Geneva Convention that focuses on the protection of victims of international armed conflicts.¹³ Protocol I calls for the protection and care of the wounded, sick, and shipwrecked regardless of whether they are military or civilians.¹⁴ To protect civilians from unnecessary injury or death, Protocol I obliges combatants to distinguish themselves from the civilian population while engaged\n⁶ *Id.*\n⁷ *Id.*\n⁸ *Id.*\n⁹ See Geneva Convention, *supra* note 2.\n¹⁰ *Id.* art. 3.\n¹¹ *Id.* art. 14.\n¹² *Id.*\n¹³ Protocol I, *supra* note 1, art. 3.\n¹⁴ *Id.*\n2017 THE TARGETING OF NON-STATE-AFFILIATED CIVILIANS 1017\nin an attack.¹⁵ The civilian population is specifically protected under Part IV, which demands the parties to distinguish at all times between civilian populations and combatants; as well as between civilian objects and military objectives.¹⁶ Further, Protocol I provides that if there is doubt as to whether a person is a civilian, that person should be treated as a civilian.¹⁷ In addition, parties are prohibited from making the civilian population the object of an attack, or making acts or threats intended to terrorize the civilian population.¹⁸\nProtocol I also protects civilians by prohibiting indiscriminate attacks such as those not directed at a specific military objective as well as the use of combat means that cannot be sufficiently limited.¹⁹ However, there are limits because the presence or movement of civilians will not render certain areas immune from military operations.²⁰ For example, if a party to the conflict uses a movement of civilians to shield military objects, that party would be in violation of the Protocol. The purpose of the Additional Protocol is to protect civilians during armed conflicts, so a State using civilians as shields will be held accountable for the LOAC violation. In addition, the Hague Convention states that the right of belligerents to adopt means of injuring the enemy is not unlimited.²¹ By limiting the means used against the enemy, civilians are also protected from unnecessary suffering due to the type of weapons used in warfare.²² The purpose of the Hague Convention was to infuse humanity into armed conflicts.²³ By forcing States to use approved weapons, which take into account human suffering, civilians are indirectly protected from inhumane weaponry.\nProtocol I requires precautionary measures to be taken during\n15 Id. art. 44.\n16 Id. art. 48.\n17 Id. art. 50.\n18 Id. art. 48.\n19 Protocol I, supra note 12, art. 51.\n20 Id.\n21 Convention (IV) Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land and its Annex: Regulations Concerning the Laws and Customs of War on Land art. 22, Oct. 18, 1907, 36 Stat. 2277, U.N.T.S. 277.\n22 Id.\n23 Id.\n1018\nN.C. J. INT'L L.\n[Vol. XLII\nattack planning to limit the injury and death of civilians, as well as damage to civilian objects.²⁴ Specifically, Article 57 instructs parties to take constant care in military operations to spare civilians and civilian objects by requiring parties to verify objectives to be attacked and to take all feasible precautions to avoid and minimize incidental loss of civilian life or injury.²⁵ The parties must also refrain from launching any attack that may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, civilian injury, or loss of civilian property.²⁶ Further, parties are required to cancel or suspend attacks if it becomes clear the objective is not a military one or that the attack will cause loss of civilian life or property or will cause civilian injuries.²⁷ Protocol I also requires parties, to the maximum extent feasible, remove civilians and civilian objects from the vicinity of military objects.²⁸ In addition, parties are to avoid locating military objects within or near densely populated areas.²⁹ The purpose of these measures are to ensure States are being mindful of civilians and civilian property from the beginning of attack planning all the way through the attacks themselves.³⁰\n## B. Civilians Directly Participating in Hostilities\nProtocol I protects civilians when viewed as innocent bystanders, but what if civilians participate in hostilities? Under the Protocol, parties to an international armed conflict may only target civilians for such time as the civilians take a direct part in hostilities.³¹ At that point, the civilians lose their civilian status protection and can then be targeted by combatants as legally permissible. The timeframe for which civilians can be targeted while directly participating in hostilities is defined by Protocol I as the time during which they are participating.³² However, it is important to keep in mind that the right of the noncombatant population to protection involves a corresponding duty to abstain\n24 Protocol I, supra note 1, art. 57.\n25 Id.\n26 Id.\n27 Id.\n28 Id. art. 58.\n29 Id. art. 57.\n30 Protocol I, supra note 1, art. 57.\n31 Id. art. 51.\n32 Id.\n2017 THE TARGETING OF NON-STATE-AFFILIATED CIVILIANS 1019\nfrom hostilities.³³\nAs an example, if a civilian who is caught in the middle of an international armed conflict decides to pick up a rifle and shoot at a Party to the conflict, the Party’s armed force may target the civilian so long as the civilian poses a threat. If the civilian were to drop the rifle and run back to his house, he could no longer be targeted by the armed force. The targeting of civilians while directly participating in hostilities is rooted in LOAC; any potential domestic law violations would be determined by the civilian’s State. Civilians directly participating in hostilities may face repercussions based on their actions that violate domestic criminal laws as well as being targeted by the enemy State. The Third Geneva Convention also addresses civilians participating in hostilities.\nThe Third Geneva Convention (“Convention”) was adopted in 1949, and its purpose was the protection of the victims of war, both civilian and prisoner.³⁴ This Convention mainly addresses the treatment of prisoners of war, but it also recognizes civilian participation in hostilities.³⁵ Under this Convention, *levée en masse* is the spontaneous taking up of arms by civilian inhabitants of a non-occupied territory when the invading enemy approaches.³⁶ In this case, the civilians would be allowed prisoner-of-war status because they participated in hostilities spontaneously, without the time to form themselves into regular armed units; but they must carry arms openly and respect the laws of war.³⁷ Aside from prisoner of war status, LOAC also addresses combatant immunity and targetability.³⁸\nCombatant immunity is addressed in Protocol I, wherein it states that members of a Party’s armed force are combatants, and\n³³ Karma Nabulsi, *Evolving Conceptions of Civilians and Belligerents: One Hundred Years After the Hague Peace Conferences, in CIVILIANS IN WAR 9, 16* (Simon Chesterman ed., 2001) (quoting Henry Richmond Droop, *On the Relations Between an Invading Army and the Inhabitants, and the Conditions Under Which Irregular Troops Are Entitled to the Same Treatment as Regular Soldiers*, TRANSACTIONS OF THE GROTIUS SOCIETY 713 (1871)).\n³⁴ Geneva Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War art. 4, Aug. 12, 1949, 6 U.S.T. 3316, 75 U.N.T.S. 135 [hereinafter Geneva POW].\n³⁵ *Id.*\n³⁶ *Id.*\n³⁷ *Id.*\n³⁸ See Protocol I, supra note 1.\n1020\nN.C. J. INT'L L.\n[Vol. XLII]\nthey have the right to participate directly in hostilities.³⁹ The term “combatant” excludes medical personnel, chaplains, and civilians.⁴⁰ Accordingly, in international armed conflict, combatants enjoy immunity regarding their acts as part of hostilities, but it does not prohibit others from engaging in those types of hostilities. Although non-combatants are not specifically prohibited from engaging in hostilities during an armed conflict, they may be directly targeted by the enemy and may face domestic criminal charges for their actions. Therefore, civilians engaging in hostilities would not be entitled to the combatant immunity that is given to combatants participating in an international armed conflict. Thus, civilians would only be entitled to prisoner of war status in limited cases, and they would not be entitled to combatant immunity.\nRegarding targetability, civilians are not to be targeted by the parties to an armed conflict, and civilians are to be generally protected against the dangers arising from military operations.⁴¹ However, LOAC allows civilians to be targeted by an armed force if and for so long as the civilian is directly participating in hostilities.⁴² Therefore, civilians enjoy the freedom from targetability so long as they are not taking a direct part in the hostilities. This freedom from direct targetability extends to a point under LOAC. A State choosing to target a legal military objective must determine if civilians and their property may be damaged by the attack.⁴³ If so, the State must conduct a balancing test to ensure the necessity of taking out the military objective outweighs the possible damage that could be caused to civilians and their property.⁴⁴ In summation, civilians do not have combatant immunity, they may be granted prisoner of war status during a levée en masse, and they cannot be directly targeted unless they are directly participating in hostilities.⁴⁵\nEven with the existence of International Humanitarian Law (“IHL”) seeking to protect civilians during times of war, civilians\n39 Id. art. 43.\n40 Id.\n41 Id. art. 51.\n42 Id.\n43 Geneva POW, supra note 34, art. 4.\n44 Id.\n45 Id.\n2017 THE TARGETING OF NON-STATE-AFFILIATED CIVILIANS 1021\nstill experience loss. IHL exists with the purpose of protecting civilians during an ongoing armed conflict, but civilians can still be legally killed or injured.⁴⁶ If done according to the Geneva Conventions’ rules of discrimination and proportionality, nations may still strike enemy targets that lead to the loss of limbs, lives, and loved ones for civilians.⁴⁷ As examples, fighter jets can strike a weapons cache next to an apartment complex, a convoy can speed through a school playground,⁴⁸ and combatants can return fire in a crowded street. Aside from a country’s stance on ethics in times of war, the plight of civilians has practical drawbacks, such as the hatred survivors have toward foreign governments and protests following civilian casualties.⁴⁹ The United States military came to understand that it is important to win the hearts and minds of the civilian population in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.⁵⁰ Based on the implications that the United States was callously indifferent regarding civilian casualties, it started tracking the damage it caused and responded directly to affected families.⁵¹ The efforts by the U.S. government to recognize the importance of paying respect to the families of injured or killed civilians is another step toward protecting civilians during times of war.\nInternational Humanitarian Law provides the basis for the protection of civilians during an ongoing armed conflict, but does that translate from the physical world to the cyber world? The cyberspace domain offers capabilities that are far different from the physical domain. Cyberspace provides the cloak of anonymity that may shield civilians and even States from being identified as the responsible party for cyber operations. The protections afforded to civilians have been roughly translated from the physical to the cyber domain by the Tallinn Manual’s International Group of Experts as well as Guidance by the International Committee of the Red Cross.\n### III.

J. INT'L L.\n[Vol. XLII\n## Domain\nCivilians enjoy very much the same protections in the cyberspace domain as they do in the physical domain. The Tallinn Manual states that civilians are defined in the cyberspace domain as they are under the Additional Protocol I of the Geneva Convention.⁵² Specifically, civilians are defined in terms of neither being members of armed forces nor members of a *levée en masse*.⁵³ As such, individual civilians, as well as civilian populations, shall not be the object of a cyber-attack by a party to the armed conflict.⁵⁴ A cyber-attack is any cyber operation or activity that is reasonably expected to cause injury or death to a person or the damage or destruction to objects.⁵⁵ In addition, LOAC applies to the targeting of people or objects during an armed conflict regardless of the means or methods of warfare that are used.⁵⁶ These seemingly broad definitions are key to protecting civilians during armed conflicts because parties to the conflict are held accountable for actions taken which are incompatible with the law of war.\n## A. Cyber Operations and the Law of Armed Conflict\nDefining cyber warfare, as a whole, is better understood by looking at its component parts. Cyberspace, in general, is the domain within the information environment made up of the interdependent network of information technology infrastructures and the resident data.⁵⁷ Cyber warfare can be viewed as a combined concept of cyberspace operations, offensive cyberspace operations, and defensive cyberspace operations.⁵⁸ Cyber operations are the employment of cyberspace capabilities where the primary purpose is to achieve objectives in and through\n⁵² TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE 104-05 (Michael N.

To do so, States conduct network reconnaissance for both operational requirements, as well as to ensure planned attacks do not cause collateral damage and casualties outside of what is acceptable under LOAC principles.⁶⁶\n⁵⁹ Id.\n⁶⁰ Id.\n⁶¹ Id.\n⁶² David Turns, *Cyber Warfare and the Notion of Direct Participation in Hostilities*, 17 J.

INT'L L.\n[Vol. XLII\nThere are some scholars and experts who view cyber operations as falling outside of the reach of the UN Charter or LOAC. Due to the UN Charter being written long before the advent of the Internet, the UN Charter was not written with a clear intention of including cyber operations.⁶⁷ Scholars and experts adhering to this view believe the UN Charter encompasses only physical attacks, and cyber operations will almost certainly not involve the use of physical force.⁶⁸ According to this line of thought, a country would not violate LOAC by deliberately launching cyber operations at civilian-owned targets.⁶⁹ However, the Tallinn Manual examines cyber operations as falling under the UN Charter and being subject to LOAC.⁷⁰\nThe LOAC principle of distinction, as codified in Additional Protocol I, and incorporated into the Tallinn Manual, requires that parties to an armed conflict distinguish between the civilian population and combatants, as well as between civilian objects and military objectives.⁷¹ This requirement seeks to protect civilians and their property by holding the parties to armed conflict accountable for the targets they choose to attack. Further, the principle of distinction precludes any rationale or justification by a party for an attack not permitted by LOAC.⁷² In cases where there is doubt as to whether a person is a civilian in the cyber domain, that person shall be considered a civilian.⁷³ This requirement complicates the cyber battlefield, because there are many civilians using computers and computer networks, and it may be very difficult to discern who is and is not a civilian.\nDetermining whether actors in the cyberspace domain are civilians, and may possibly be targeted when directly participating in hostilities during an international armed conflict, is difficult. Inaccurate attribution in cyberspace may leave vulnerable the civilians caught in the crossfire. The International Court of Justice maintains high standards for requisite attribution of an armed attack, and in the cyber domain, attribution for the act and actor\n⁶⁷ See Cyber, supra note 57.\n⁶⁸ Id.\n⁶⁹ Id.\n⁷⁰ See TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 52.\n⁷¹ Geneva Convention, supra note 2, art. 14; Geneva POW, supra note 34, art. 4.\n⁷² TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 52, at Rule 33.\n⁷³ Id.\n2017 THE TARGETING OF NON-STATE-AFFILIATED CIVILIANS 1025\nare difficult to prove with scientific certainty.⁷⁴ Further, this attribution on the Internet is “the most technologically challenging level of attribution,” because the attributing party is seeking “to determine the original individual or entity that is responsible for launching the attack.”⁷⁵\nIn the United States, the White House, State Department, and Department of Defense recognize the need to treat cyber operations as potentially falling under the UN Charter and requiring a LOAC determination prior to employment.⁷⁶ Specifically, there is concern from these agencies that the use of cyber weapons could trigger unintended consequences and might harm diplomatic relations.⁷⁷ Senior military officials have stated that attribution of cyber-attacks has remained a challenge, and that challenge factors into the difficulty of determining what constitutes a cyber act of war.⁷⁸ Further, the National Security Director and U.S. Cyber Command chief has stated that the United States needs to think outside of the cyber realm regarding retaliation, and it needs to define acceptability limits regarding hacking.⁷⁹ In addition, the United States needs to prepare a set of capabilities and show its determination for using them.⁸⁰ Members of the U.S. Congress have echoed the need for cyber deterrence\n⁷⁴ See Jason F.

INT'L L.\n[Vol. XLII\nand state that in order for cyber deterrence to work, there needs to be an established policy in place to put other countries on notice as to what response to expect from the United States.⁸¹\nThe U.S. stance regarding cyber operations and LOAC became clearer as senior leaders discussed their take on how the United States operates in the cyber domain.⁸² The National Security Director and Cyber Command Chief has stated that anything the United States does in the cyber arena must follow LOAC, so cyber responses must be proportional and in line with historical norms.⁸³ Further, cyberspace capabilities and operations parallel those in the physical domain, but cyber represents a different technical application in an attempt to achieve some of the exact same effects.⁸⁴ Additionally, the development of cyber weapons represents the next evolutionary step in warfare, so it possesses all of the ethical concerns posed by similar weapons developed in the past.⁸⁵ Therefore, the United States places great importance on maintaining compliance with LOAC even though cyber capabilities and operations were not planned for by the LOAC founders.⁸⁶\n## B. The Objects of Cyber Attacks\nThe Tallinn Manual also discusses who may be made the object of cyber-attacks and lists them as: 1) members of the armed forces; 2) members of organized armed groups; 3) civilians taking a direct part in hostilities; and 4) participants in a *levée en masse* during an international armed conflict.⁸⁷ It should be noted that the first two categories can be made the object of an attack based on their status; however, the last two categories can only be made targets based on their actions.

Inhabitants of unoccupied territory during an international armed conflict who engage in cyber operations as part of a levée en masse are afforded combatant immunity and prisoner of war status.⁹³ In addition, participants in a cyber-based levée en masse are targetable throughout the period of their participation therein.⁹⁴ To be considered a levée en masse, the participating individuals must be inhabitants of non-occupied territory, who upon the invading enemy’s approach, take up arms to resist them.⁹⁵ In the cyber context, “taking up arms” refers to engaging in cyber operations against the enemy.⁹⁶\nThis “taking up arms” in cyberspace is theoretical based on the facts that would have to exist for a cyber levée en masse to be\n⁸⁸ *Id.*\n⁸⁹ *Id.*\n⁹⁰ Nils Melzer, *Interpretive Guidance on the Notion of Direct Participation Under International Humanitarian Law*, INT’L COMM.

The difference is the virtually untested nature of the cyberspace domain. It remains unclear exactly how States are to behave in cyberspace, what rises to the level of a cyber-attack, and what level of physical domain response is authorized for a particular cyber-attack. These and other unresolved translations from the physical realm to the cyber domain make difficult the protection of civilians during an international armed conflict. A step further would be the impact on civilians when they decide to directly participate in cyber hostilities.\n## IV. Civilians Directly Participating in Hostilities in the Cyberspace Domain\nThe Tallinn Manual provides that, based on LOAC principles, there is no bar of any category of person from participating in cyber operations, whether during an international or non-international armed conflict.¹⁰² However, civilians participating in an armed conflict through cyber operations would likely not be entitled to prisoner of war status and combatant immunity, and they could be targeted based on their participation.¹⁰³ The\n⁹⁷ *Id.*\n⁹⁸ Geneva POW, *supra* note 34, art. 4.\n⁹⁹ *Id.*\n¹⁰⁰ *Id.*\n¹⁰¹ *Id.*\n¹⁰² TALLINN MANUAL, *supra* note 52, at Rule 25.\n¹⁰³ *Id.* at Rule 25, comment 2.\n2017 THE TARGETING OF NON-STATE-AFFILIATED CIVILIANS 1029\nentitlement to combatant immunity and prisoner of war status are dependent upon the individual being engaged in an international armed conflict, as opposed to solely a non-international armed conflict or actions not rising to the level of armed conflict.¹⁰⁴ Even if civilians participate in hostilities, the majority of the International Group of Experts agree that civilians retain their civilian status.¹⁰⁵ However, civilians remain subject to prosecution under the applicable domestic laws of the States capturing them.¹⁰⁶\n## A. Defining Direct Participation in Hostilities\nAs previously mentioned, civilians can be made the object of cyber-attacks if they are directly taking part in hostilities. Though civilians are protected from attack during international armed conflicts, they lose that protection if and for so long as they directly participate in hostilities.¹⁰⁷ This protection from attack and subsequent loss of protection only applies to civilians; it does not apply to members of armed forces, organized armed groups, or participants in a *levée en masse*.¹⁰⁸ Further, members of groups failing to qualify as organized armed groups would also qualify as civilians under this rule.¹⁰⁹ For example, a group would fail to be recognized as an organized armed group if they lack the required level of organization or if they fail to maintain a continuous combat function.¹¹⁰\nConducting operations in cyberspace that may rise to the level of direct participation in hostilities can be better understood by looking at the functions or tasks carried out in the cyber domain. Those involved in cyber operations seemingly fall in to three main categories according to their functions: 1) those who design or write the programs used for offense or defensive cyber operations; 2) those who install these programs on computer systems, act as service administrators, and provide technical maintenance; and 3)\n¹⁰⁴ *Id.* at Rule 25.\n¹⁰⁵ *Id.* at Rule 29.\n¹⁰⁶ *Id.* at Rule 29.\n¹⁰⁷ *Id.* at Rules 32, 35.\n¹⁰⁸ Geneva POW, *supra* note 34, art. 4; TALLINN MANUAL, *supra* note 52, at Rule 35.\n¹⁰⁹ *Id.*\n¹¹⁰ *Id.* art. 4; Melzer, *supra* note 90, at Part I.2.b.\n1030\nN.C. J. INT'L L.\n[Vol. XLII\nthose who actually operate the computer programs.¹¹¹ A lone civilian could presumably be filling all of these roles in a solo operation.\nWhen civilians directly participate in hostilities through cyber operations during an international armed conflict, they are liable to be attacked either through cyber means or other lawful means under LOAC.¹¹² IHL does not define direct participation in hostilities, so direct participation must be interpreted in good faith according to the ordinary meaning and the context based on the object and purpose of IHL.¹¹³ Treaty law in this area refers to hostilities in terms of international or non-international armed conflict, so that should be the threshold; hostilities cannot refer to internal disturbances, riots, or isolated and sporadic events.¹¹⁴ Not all conduct during an armed conflict constitutes part of hostilities.¹¹⁵ Civilian participation in hostilities can occur in various forms and intensity levels in a wide variety of geographical, cultural, political, and military contexts, so the circumstances at the relevant time and place of the hostilities should be examined.¹¹⁶\nThe direct participation in hostilities refers to specific acts, which are carried out by individuals as part of the hostilities between two parties in an armed conflict.¹¹⁷ There are therefore two elements: 1) direct participation; and 2) hostilities. Participation in hostilities can either be direct or indirect; direct participation is the engagement in specific hostile acts.¹¹⁸ The concept of hostilities is best described as the aggregate of all hostile acts carried out by all individuals, either armed forces, organized armed groups, or civilians, during an armed conflict.¹¹⁹\nThe specific acts carried out by civilians qualify as direct participation in hostilities if they meet all of the following criteria:\n¹¹¹ Cyber, supra note 57.\n¹¹² Geneva POW, supra note 34, art. 4; TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 52, at Rule 35.\n¹¹³ Melzer, supra note 90, at Part II.B.\n¹¹⁴ Id.\n¹¹⁵ Id.\n¹¹⁶ Id.\n¹¹⁷ Id. at Part VI.\n¹¹⁸ Id.\n¹¹⁹ Melzer, supra note 90, at Part VI.\n2017 THE TARGETING OF NON-STATE-AFFILIATED CIVILIANS 1031\n1) the act is likely to adversely affect the military operations or capacity of a party to an armed conflict or inflict death, injury, or destruction on persons or objects protected against direct attack, which is the threshold of harm; 2) there must be a direct causal link between the act and harm that is likely to occur from the act; and 3) the act must be specifically designed to directly cause the required threshold of harm in support of a party to the armed conflict.¹²⁰ The threshold of harm is based on likely harm and does not require the act to materialize into the expected level of harm.¹²¹ Additionally, the act does not have to be an actual attack against troops or military objects; it also includes acts of sabotage as well as disturbing deployments and communications.¹²²\nIn addition to meeting the threshold of harm, the second criterion requires there also be a direct causal link between the act and the harm. For there to be direct causation, there must be a sufficiently close causal relationship between the act and the resulting harm.¹²³ Specifically, direct causation should be brought about in one causal step.¹²⁴ Individual actions that can be viewed as merely supporting one side to an armed conflict or that only build up or maintain the capacity of a party is excluded from the concept of direct participation in hostilities.¹²⁵ For example, providing supplies for a party or financing the actions of a party to an armed conflict would bring about a result, but there is not direct causation for the potential harm. Other examples of indirect participation would be scientific research and design, recruitment and the training of personnel, and the production or transportation of weapons or equipment.¹²⁶\nThe third criterion requires there be a belligerent nexus, which is that an act must be specifically designed to directly cause the required threshold of harm in support of a party to the armed conflict.¹²⁷ Accordingly, the act must be objectively likely to inflict harm, and it must be specifically designed to do so in\n¹²⁰ *Id.* at Part V.\n¹²¹ *Id.*\n¹²² *Id.*\n¹²³ *Id.* at Part V.2.b.\n¹²⁴ *Id.* at Part V.2.f.\n¹²⁵ Melzer, *supra* note 90, at Part V.\n¹²⁶ *Id.* at Part V.2.b.\n¹²⁷ *Id.* at Part V.3.\n1032\nN.C. J. INT'L L.\n[Vol. XLII]\nsupport of a party to the armed conflict.¹²⁸ Therefore, violence that is not designed to harm a party to an armed conflict cannot amount to direct participation in hostilities.¹²⁹ This type of violence is left solely to domestic law enforcement measures and not LOAC or IHL. The belligerent nexus requirement is important, because there are many activities during armed conflict that cause a considerable level of harm but fall short of direct participation in hostilities. This is exemplified by violent crimes committed for reasons unrelated to the conflict, such as robberies or murders, as well as the theft of military equipment for private use or sale.¹³⁰ Also requiring special attention is use of individual self-defense or defense of others. If a civilian uses force to protect his property from looting, he is not doing so with a belligerent nexus.¹³¹ Instead, he is acting out of self-defense.\nUnderstanding whether hostilities by civilians during armed conflict rise to the level of direct participation is not enough. The defining moment of when the direct participation in hostilities begins and ends is also important. Preparatory measures leading up to the execution of the specific act, and the movement to and from the location of the execution, all constitute integral parts of the act.¹³² Accordingly, IHL concerns itself with more than just exactly when the act took place; it looks at the totality of the circumstances surrounding the civilian’s direct participation in hostilities.¹³³ This is a significant point, because civilians lose their protection against direct attacks for such time as they directly participate in hostilities.¹³⁴\nPreparatory measures are those that IHL would describe as military operations in preparation for an attack and which are so closely linked to the execution of the specific act that they constitute an integral part of the act.¹³⁵ Even so, there is no requirement that the preparatory measures occur immediately prior to the specific act or even in close geographic proximity to the\n128 Id.\n129 Id.\n130 Id.\n131 Melzer, supra note 90, at Part V.3.\n132 Id. at Part VI.\n133 Id.\n134 Id.\n135 Id.\n2017 THE TARGETING OF NON-STATE-AFFILIATED CIVILIANS 1033\nplace of the specific act.¹³⁶ An example in the physical domain would be a civilian who builds a bomb in his garage, which he intends to place in the road in order to blow it up and injure armed forces during an international armed conflict. In this illustration, the preparatory measures taken by the civilian bomb maker in his garage, as well as the transit to and from the place where he plants the bomb, would all be considered part of the direct participation in hostilities. Thus, the bomb maker could be targeted at any point from when he starts building the bomb in his garage until he returns home from planting it. Also included in general preparatory measures would be the transporting of personnel, gathering of intelligence, and equipping and instructing armed forces.¹³⁷ Where the execution of a hostile act does not require deployment, such as hostilities in cyberspace, the duration of the act should be limited to the immediate execution of the act.¹³⁸\n## B. Tallinn Manual View of Direct Participation in Hostilities\nThe Tallinn Manual’s International Group of Experts generally agrees with the three cumulative criteria for qualification as a direct participation in hostilities as applied to cyberspace.¹³⁹ First, there must be a threshold of harm, wherein the civilian has the intended or actual effect of negatively affecting the military operations or capabilities of a party to an armed conflict or inflicting death, physical harm, or material destruction on persons or objects protected against direct attack.¹⁴⁰ Physical damage to objects or harm to individuals is not required, so long as the cyber act negatively affects the party militarily.¹⁴¹ Second, there must be a direct causal link between the act and the harm intended.¹⁴² An example would be a civilian conducting cyber acts against an armed force in international armed conflict, wherein the civilian disrupts the command and control, even temporarily, for the armed force. Finally, there must be a belligerent nexus established by the\n¹³⁶ *Id.*\n¹³⁷ *Id.*\n¹³⁸ Melzer, *supra* note 90, at Part VI.\n¹³⁹ TALLINN MANUAL, *supra* note 52, at Rule 35, comment 4.\n¹⁴⁰ *Id.*\n¹⁴¹ *Id.*\n¹⁴² *Id.*\n1034\nN.C. J. INT'L L.\n[Vol. XLII\nact directly relating to the hostilities.¹⁴³\nIn cyberspace, direct participation in hostilities by civilians may be more difficult to delineate. Determining whether a civilian directly participated in conventional hostilities is complex by itself; making the same determination in cyber-hostilities is especially so.¹⁴⁴ Civilians conducting cyber-attacks related to an armed conflict would qualify as an act of direct participation in hostilities.¹⁴⁵ A cyber-attack is defined as a cyber operation that is reasonably expected to cause injury or death to persons or damage or destruction to objects.¹⁴⁶ Accordingly, civilians conducting cyber-attacks in this way would meet the three criteria for directly participating in hostilities. Other examples of direct participation include civilians conducting cyber operations with the intent to identify vulnerabilities in a targeted computer network or system, or civilians designing malware to take advantage of vulnerabilities in the systems of a party to an armed conflict.¹⁴⁷ Further examples in the cyber domain include civilians using cyber means to gather information on enemy operations and passing that information to the other armed force in the conflict as well as conducting distributed denial of service operations against military systems.¹⁴⁸\nOn the other hand, not all cyber operations by civilians would rise to the level of direct participation in hostilities. For example, designing malware for a specific purpose and making it available online, even if it is actually used by someone else to conduct an attack during an armed conflict, would not be considered direct participation.¹⁴⁹ What would be lacking would be the threshold of harm in the first criterion; the malware creator never had the intended or actual effect of negatively affecting military operations or capabilities. Another example would be civilians simply maintaining computer equipment generally, even if that equipment were eventually used in hostilities.¹⁵⁰ Again, what would be\n¹⁴³ *Id.*\n¹⁴⁴ Emily Crawford, *Virtual Battlegrounds: Direct Participation in Cyber Warfare*, 9 J.

Cyber operations during an armed conflict that are taken for purely criminal or private reasons would not qualify as direct participation in hostilities.¹⁵¹ As an example, a criminal using cyber means to steal funds from a party to a conflict for purely personal gain, and not to negatively affect the party, would not be directly participating in hostilities. What is difficult about this example is that the party to the armed conflict would have to determine the intent of the civilian actor, which could be disguised as purely personal and criminal when it could in fact be aimed at adversely affecting the party to the conflict. Taken a step further, if the individual stole the money from the party in order to finance particular military operations, the operation to steal the money would be considered a direct participation in hostilities.¹⁵²\nPreparatory measures in cyberspace differ from those taken in the physical domain. Because civilians can be directly targeted for the duration of time during which they are directly participating in hostilities, it is important for parties to an armed conflict to understand the timeframe of direct participation.¹⁵³ The actions taken in cyberspace immediately preceding or subsequent to a qualifying act of direct participation are included in the preparatory measures.¹⁵⁴ As an example, a civilian travelling to and from the location of the computer he uses to mount a cyber operation would be included in the preparatory measures, and the civilian could be directly targeted in transit.¹⁵⁵ The time for preparatory measures may even extend as far backward and forward in time as the causal link to the action exists.¹⁵⁶ For example, in a cyber operation this would include the time when the civilian first starts to explore the vulnerabilities of the system of a party to an armed conflict, the time the individual creates the cyber tool to exploit the vulnerabilities, the period of time the civilian attacks the system, and through to the time the individual assesses\n¹⁵¹ TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 52, at Rule 35, comment 6.\n¹⁵² Id.\n¹⁵³ Id.\n¹⁵⁴ Id. at Rule 35, comment 7.\n¹⁵⁵ Id.\n¹⁵⁶ Id.\n1036\nN.C. J. INT'L L.\n[Vol. XLII\nthe damage to the system.\nIn addition to the preparatory measures taken for a cyber operation, parties to an armed conflict must take into account the delayed effects of direct participation in hostilities by civilians. The actions taken by civilians in the cyber domain have some parallels to the physical domain, but they also vary widely. The emplacement of a logic bomb, which is designed to activate at some point in the future upon either a command or after a predetermined period of time, is an example.¹⁵⁷ The majority of the Tallinn Manual’s International Group of Experts takes the position that the time frame for which the civilian is directly participating, and can thus be targeted, is from the beginning of his involvement in mission planning until the individual terminates his active role in the operation.¹⁵⁸ It is important to point out that the end of the period of direct participation may not sync up with the point when the damage occurs.¹⁵⁹ For example, the first civilian may have created and emplaced the logic bomb, which is awaiting a command prompt to activate it. A second civilian may be the one to actually command the bomb to activate. In this example, the first civilian could have halted his period of direct participation and would no longer be directly targetable when the damage actually occurs. Thus, the key is for parties to determine when individuals are targetable based on when their participation begins and ends.¹⁶⁰\n## C. Determination of Direct Participation in Hostilities Complicated by Cyberspace-Specific Issues\nThe delayed effects of cyber operations complicate the accurate determination of precisely when a civilian is directly participating in cyber hostilities. The majority of the International Group of Experts takes the position that a civilian is directly participating in hostilities from the beginning of his involvement through the point in time where the civilian terminates an active role in the operation.¹⁶¹ The problem with this majority view is that it does not make clear to the participating civilian or to the\n¹⁵⁷ TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 52, at Rule 35, comment 8.\n¹⁵⁸ Id.\n¹⁵⁹ Id.\n¹⁶⁰ Id.\n¹⁶¹ Id. at Rule 35, comment 6.\n2017 THE TARGETING OF NON-STATE-AFFILIATED CIVILIANS 1037\nState being attacked the window of time during which the civilian may be directly and legally targeted. The civilian may terminate an active role by no longer checking the status of the ongoing cyber operation, but the State may still attribute the operation to the civilian and target him. The State may not discover the ongoing cyber operation until after the civilian has terminated an active role, but the State has no way of knowing the civilian has terminated his active role in the ongoing cyber operation.\nThe logic bomb example parallels civilian operations in the physical world. Coalition Forces fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan faced road-side improvised explosive devices (“IEDs”), which were responsible for causing death and injury to troops as well as damage to military objects. If a civilian was responsible for building, transporting, emplacing, and setting off the IED, the civilian could be targeted throughout the entire process.¹⁶² The beginning and end of the civilian’s direct participation in hostilities could be measured from the time he began sourcing parts for the bomb until the time he set off the IED and transited back from the bombsite. Similarly, the civilian responsible for the logic bomb in the aforementioned example could be targeted from the time he began creating the logic bomb until he commands the logic bomb to activate. However, technology in the cyber domain varies widely from technology in the physical domain.\nIn the cyber domain, individuals can create programs capable of running autonomously or semi-autonomously. A computer network attack (“CAN”) is defined as either a cyber, electronic, or physical attack against an information technology facility or against computer equipment.¹⁶³ Most of these CNAs are carried out by cyber operations, which use malicious code to infect enemy computers in order to exploit weaknesses in software, system configuration, or computer security practices.¹⁶⁴ Cyber operations also include the use of bots, or remotely, or semi-autonomously controlled programs infecting computers, as well as botnets, which perform espionage by transmitting data between themselves while\n¹⁶² *Id.* at Rule 35, comment 4 (providing that there is well-known, ongoing debate as to whether the assembly of an IED qualifies as direct participation in hostilities).\n¹⁶³ See generally CLAY WILSON, COMPUTER ATTACK AND CYBERTERRORISM 3-11 (2009) (providing insight on different types of attacks against computers).\n¹⁶⁴ *Id.*\n1038\nN.C. J. INT'L L.\n[Vol. XLII\nawaiting the final activation signal from the operator.¹⁶⁵ Malicious programs, such as spyware and malware, attack by disrupting normal computer functions or by opening a back door for a remote operator to take control of the computer.¹⁶⁶ Cyber operators have designed computer exploits which launch anonymously from thousands of infected computers and which produce waves of disruption to overwhelm the target of the operation.¹⁶⁷ The technology allowing autonomous and semi-autonomous operations in cyberspace makes difficult the task of determining the beginning and ending points of direct participation by civilians.¹⁶⁸\nA minority of the Tallinn Manual Group of Experts would break down the various steps in cyber operations such as the emplacement of the logic bomb and its activation as separate acts of direct participation.¹⁶⁹ Under this view, the civilian would only directly participate in hostilities in intermittent instances when he is actively engaged in hostilities.¹⁷⁰ This view provides greater protection to civilians, as they are shielded from directly being targeted except for the times when they are actively engaged in cyber operations.¹⁷¹ However, this view would make it very difficult for the parties engaged in armed conflict to accurately determine when civilians are directly participating and then target the civilians participating in hostilities at precisely those times. The Group of Experts is split regarding repeated cyber operations. One view is in line with the ICRC in that each cyber act must be treated separately in terms of direct participation analysis.¹⁷² On the other hand, another view is that it would make more operational sense if direct participation begins with the first cyber operation and continues throughout the period of intermittent activity.¹⁷³ The latter view removes the “revolving door” effect and simplifies target ability by making the intermittent activity a singular, start-to-finish cyber operation.\n165 Id.\n166 Id.\n167 Id.\n168 Id.\n169 TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 52, at Rule 35, comment 9.\n170 Id.\n171 Id. at Rule 35, comment 10.\n172 Id.\n173 Id.\n2017 THE TARGETING OF NON-STATE-AFFILIATED CIVILIANS 1039\nThe Tallinn Experts were also divided over the issue of presumption against direct participation.¹⁷⁴ Recall that the Tallinn Manual provides that in cases where there is doubt as to whether an individual is a civilian, that individual should be treated like a civilian.¹⁷⁵ The policy behind this principle is to ensure that civilians are protected to the utmost extent during armed conflicts. Some Tallinn Experts take this same line of thinking regarding civilians believed to be directly participating in hostilities.¹⁷⁶ These experts believe civilians in this predicament should be given the benefit of the doubt.¹⁷⁷\nHowever, other Tallinn Experts take the position that when there is doubt as to whether a civilian is directly participating in hostilities, the attacking state must review the relevant information available and act reasonably in the circumstances in determining whether to conduct the attack.¹⁷⁸ The policy behind this method rests in the attacking state’s ability to identify which targets are legal targets based on a reasonable review of the available information. The importance of these two views cannot be understated. Some experts side with protecting civilians to the maximum extent possible, while others favor the States’ ability to act while following LOAC principles.\nAlthough the Tallinn Manual agrees with ICRC Guidance’s requirements of a threshold of harm—a causal link between the action and the harm and a belligerent nexus—generally, the Tallinn Manual’s application of the ICRC’s guidance is a variation of the ICRC’s direct participation in hostilities legal regime involving cyber actions.¹⁷⁹ The Tallinn manual does not have a requirement for physical damage to objects, so actions that may not qualify as cyber-attacks may still satisfy the criterion for the threshold of harm if the action has negatively affected the targeted State.¹⁸⁰ Specifically, the Tallinn Manual provides that a civilian’s\n¹⁷⁴ Id. at Rule 35, comment 12.\n¹⁷⁵ TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 52, at Rule 33.\n¹⁷⁶ Id. at Rule 35, comment 12.\n¹⁷⁷ Id.\n¹⁷⁸ Id.\n¹⁷⁹ See Collin Allan, Direct Participation in Hostilities from Cyberspace, 50 VA.

J. INT'L L.\n[Vol. XLII]\naction which is carried out with only the intent of negatively affecting the adversary State’s military operations or to inflict death, physical harm, or material destruction on persons or objects is sufficient to show the threshold of harm.¹⁸¹ Furthermore, the majority of Tallinn experts agreed that interfering with an object’s functionality would rise to the level of destruction if a physical component must be replaced.¹⁸² Thus, the Tallinn view of the first-prong requirement of the threshold of harm may be seen as lowering the standard for what is required for civilians to be directly participating in hostilities.¹⁸³\nThe Tallinn Manual’s view of the second prong, which is the causal link between the act and the harm likely to result, also differs slightly from the ICRC Guidance.¹⁸⁴ In particular, the Tallinn Manual focuses on the intended harm.¹⁸⁵ By focusing on the intended harm, the Tallinn Manual may be lowering the standard of what is required for a civilian to participate in hostilities by looking at the civilian’s intent, rather than focusing on the likelihood of harm from the cyber operation. For example, a civilian may be directly targeted under the Tallinn Manual view for his role in assembling and storing the cyber equivalent of an IED because the individual intends the same harm as the person arming and detonating it.¹⁸⁶ By comparing the Tallinn Manual’s view with the ICRC Guidance, it is possible that the Tallinn Manual lowers the standards for what is required for civilians to be directly participating in cyber hostilities.¹⁸⁷ Therefore, civilians participating in hostilities through cyber means may be targetable in more situations than under the ICRC framework.¹⁸⁸\n## V.

That is, they are defined as neither members of the armed forces, which includes groups assimilated to the armed forces such as organized armed groups, nor those participating in a levée en masse.¹⁸⁹ Essentially, all others are considered civilians. Private contractors and employees of a party to an armed conflict who fit the definition of civilians are entitled to protection from being directly targeted, unless they are directly participating in hostilities.¹⁹⁰ In addition, private contractors and civilian employees are not entitled to combatant immunity, as they are not members of the armed force.¹⁹¹ The activities carried out by contractors and employees as well as their location of duty may expose them to an increased risk of death or injury even if they are not directly participating in hostilities.¹⁹²\n## A. State-Affiliated Civilians\nModern warfare is increasingly dependent upon private contractors and civilian employees to fill a variety of positions traditionally held by military personnel.¹⁹³ Generally, these private contractors and civilian employees are considered civilians under the same criteria that would apply to other civilians.¹⁹⁴ That is, they cannot be directly targeted by a party to the armed conflict unless and for so long as they directly participate in hostilities. Due to the special roles of private contractors and civilian employees and their proximity to armed forces in hostilities, parties to an armed conflict must make determinations regarding attacks with particular care and due consideration.¹⁹⁵\nThe majority of private contractors and civilian employees have been incorporated into State armed forces, but they do not\n---\n¹⁸⁹ See generally TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 52, Rule 29 (quoting the Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 Aug. 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts art. 50, § 1, June 8, 1977, 1125 U.N.T.S. 3).\n¹⁹⁰ Melzer, supra note 90.\n¹⁹¹ Id. at 38.\n¹⁹² Id. at 37.\n¹⁹³ Id.\n¹⁹⁴ Id.\n¹⁹⁵ Id.\n1042\nN.C.

INT'L L.\n[Vol. XLII\nperform functions that would have them directly participate in hostilities.¹⁹⁶ Nevertheless, there are some contractor and civilians filling roles that would put them in situations where they could be seen as directly participating in hostilities. For example, private contractors and civilian employees that defend the base from attack could either be directly participating in hostilities or filling a law enforcement and defense-of-others role.¹⁹⁷\nEven if they have accompanied armed forces, private contractors and civilians were never meant to (and should never be allowed to) directly participate in hostilities on behalf of a party to a conflict.¹⁹⁸ As long as they are not incorporated into armed forces, private contractors and civilian employees do not cease to be civilians, and they do not lose their civilian protection simply because they accompany armed forces.¹⁹⁹ Moreover, they do not lose their civilian protection just because they assume functions other than conducting hostilities, which traditionally would have been performed by members of armed forces.²⁰⁰ Contractors and civilian employees who directly participate in hostilities without the express authorization of the party to the armed conflict remain civilians, but they lose their protection from being directly targeted.²⁰¹ Contractors and employees can lose their civilian status if they have been incorporated into the armed forces of a party to a conflict.²⁰² If this happens, the contractors and employees would become members of an organized armed force under the command responsible for the party to the conflict and would no longer qualify as civilians.²⁰³\n---\n¹⁹⁶ See Melzer, *supra* note 90, at 37 (explaining the basic notion of direct participation in hostilities).\n¹⁹⁷ See *id.* at 44 (illustrating that “[t]he notion of direct participation in hostilities does not refer to a person’s status, function, or affiliation, but to his or her engagement in specific hostile acts”).\n¹⁹⁸ *Id.* at 38.\n¹⁹⁹ *Id.*\n²⁰⁰ *Id.*\n²⁰¹ *Id.*\n²⁰² See Melzer, *supra* note 90, at 39 (explaining that “[a]s long as they are not incorporated into the armed forces, private contractors and civilian employees do not cease to be civilians simply because they accompany the armed forces and or assume functions other than the conduct of hostilities that would traditionally have been performed by military personnel”).\n²⁰³ *Id.*\n2017 THE TARGETING OF NON-STATE-AFFILIATED CIVILIANS 1043\nThe Tallinn Manual’s international group of experts concurs that individual contractors and civilians may only be directly targeted based on their direct participation in hostilities during an armed conflict.²⁰⁴ However, there are issues that arise in cyberspace regarding the use of contractors and civilians to perform specific military operations. Unlike traditional warfare, where almost all military operations were carried out by troops and equipment, modern warfare introduces the use of cyber capabilities which conduct a portion of the military operations. An example is the hiring of a private company by a party to an armed conflict that is later contracted to perform specific military operations.²⁰⁵ Based on the military operations, the company would qualify as an organized armed group belonging to the party to the conflict.²⁰⁶ Therefore, the civilians employed as private contractors would be considered belonging to the organized armed group. However, even if the civilians were not to be considered as belonging to the organized armed group, they would still only be directly targetable when and if they are directly participating in hostilities.²⁰⁷\nCivilian government employees are also employed in positions requiring them to conduct cyber operations during an armed conflict, such as positions within an intelligence agency.²⁰⁸ If the group of civilians conducting cyber operations qualifies as an organized armed group, the civilian members are subject to attack regardless of direct participation in hostilities.²⁰⁹ Otherwise, the civilian employees are only directly targetable when they are directly participating in hostilities. As a result, the historic view of citizens carrying out actions typically performed by members of armed forces may be problematic when analyzing the cyber domain construct. The traditional view of warfare holds that private contractors and civilian employees operating in an organized armed group, affiliated with armed forces in an armed conflict, would not be entitled to combatant status.²¹⁰\n204 TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 52, at Rule 34, comment 7.\n205 Id.\n206 Id.\n207 Id.\n208 Id. at Rule 34, comment 8.\n209 Id. at Rule 34, comment 7.\n210 See Sean Watts, Notion of Combatancy in Cyber Warfare, FOURTH INT’L. CONF.\n1044\nN.C. J. INT'L L.\n[Vol. XLII]\nFurthermore, a party to the armed conflict employing civilians to perform intelligence functions, attack execution, or other CNA operations would violate the law of war.²¹¹ The reasoning behind this view is that only members of armed forces or assimilated organizations are granted combatant status because they meet the following conditions: (i) they are commanded by a person responsible for his subordinates; (ii) they have a fixed distinctive emblem recognizable at distance; (iii) they carry arms openly; and (iv) they conduct their operation in accordance with the laws and customs of war.²¹² Accordingly, under the traditional view, parties to an armed conflict should employ members of the armed force to carry out CNA functions, and if they desire contractors or civilian employees to fill these roles, then the parties should incorporate them into the regular armed forces.²¹³\nDue to the vastly different landscape and operations carried out in cyberspace as opposed to the physical domain, a suggested course of action would be to rely less on the aforementioned four conditions and instead look to state affiliation.²¹⁴ The four criteria from the 1874 Brussels Declaration apply perfectly to traditional warfare, but operations in cyberspace are conducted without the need of having a fixed recognizable emblem or of carrying arms openly. By requiring state affiliation for civilian employees, it preserves concern for the principle of distinction in CNA from the Brussels criteria.²¹⁵ States employing civilians to conduct cyber operations are less likely to be doing so to prevent the enemy from attacking the civilians.²¹⁶ Instead, States are likely taking advantage of the economic, training, and recruiting advantages that develop as a result of not being limited to armed forces filling these behind-the-lines roles.²¹⁷ The fact that cyber operations take\nON CYBER CONFLICT, 235, 242 (2012), https://ccdcoe.org/cycon/2012/proceedings/d2r1s10_watts.pdf [https://perma.cc/X6F2-TTRP] [hereinafter Notion of Combatancy].\n²¹¹ Id.\n²¹² See id. at 245 (citing the Project of an International Declaration Concerning the Laws and Customs of War, Aug. 27, 1874, 4 Martens Nouveau Recueil (ser. 2) 219 (“1874 Brussels Declaration”)).\n²¹³ Id.\n²¹⁴ Id.\n²¹⁵ Id.\n²¹⁶ See Notion of Combatancy, supra note 210, at 246.\n²¹⁷ Id.\n2017 THE TARGETING OF NON-STATE-AFFILIATED CIVILIANS 1045\nplace far from the battlefield also bolsters the position of state affiliation, because there is no concern that the enemy will be confused regarding distinction in targeting.²¹⁸\nUnder the state affiliation view of civilians taking part in cyber operations, discipline in warfare will continue to be preserved as it is under the four Brussels criteria.²¹⁹ Currently, civilians directly participating in hostilities are not subject to the internal military disciplinary system.²²⁰ However, the well-developed legal regimes that prosecute and punish war crimes operate in a manner to vindicate concerns for discipline and humanity.²²¹ In addition to international enforcement bodies, domestic criminal codes now serve as mechanisms where civilians are equally susceptible to prosecution for any war crimes they have committed.²²² Under the state-affiliation view, States will be able to employ civilians to conduct cyber operations while enabling combatant status. States will also be able to maintain the critically important notions of distinction and discipline as provided under the four Brussels criteria.²²³\nStates employing private contractors and civilian employees do so because of the different landscape and types of operations carried out in cyberspace. As they are written and observed, current LOAC principles, ICRC guidance, and the Tallinn Manual hold that civilians operating in cyberspace in a way that directly participates in hostilities are subject to directly being targeted but are not given combatant immunity. The view of letting state-affiliation drive combatant status determinations for cyberspace operations provides civilians with combatant status, or a version of it, while parties to an armed conflict can still conduct warfare and be no worse off. Currently, parties to an armed conflict operating in cyberspace are left with the difficult task of making determinations regarding direct participation in hostilities by civilians operating anonymously. The state-affiliation view would, at the least, put civilians on notice of what their consequences of participation entail, as well as protect them by\n218 Id.\n219 Id. at 247.\n220 Id.\n221 Id. at 248.\n222 See Notion of Combatancy, supra note 210, at 248.\n223 Id.\n1046\nN.C.

When viewed as either contractors, who are working on behalf of a State engaged in an international armed conflict, or hacktivists, who operate outside of the control of the State but engage in cyber operations in favor of the State, the statuses of each may be seen as divergent.²²⁴ While neither of the two would qualify for combatant immunity, based on the four requirements provided by the Third Geneva Convention,²²⁵ contractors would have the best shot at being entitled prisoner-of-war (“POW”) status.²²⁶ Due to the nature of their service, contractors accompanying an armed force likely carry identification cards associating them with the armed force.²²⁷ Accordingly, contractors would not be given combatant status, but they would be more likely than hacktivists to be given POW status.²²⁸\nCivilians accompanying armed forces are afforded some protection, but that protection comes with the inherent danger of accompanying armed forces. State-affiliated civilians qualifying for the narrow category of “civilians accompanying the armed forces” could be eligible for POW status while at the same time also be legitimate military targets for the enemy State.²²⁹ These civilians would likely be performing duties in the functional category of operating and maintaining the cyber operations systems.²³⁰ The civilians filling this state-affiliated role would\n²²⁴ See Logan Liles, *The Civilian Cyber Battlefield: Non-State Cyber Operators’ Status Under the Law of Armed Conflict*, 39 N.C.

The majority of the participation by a state-affiliated civilian cyber scientist would be viewed as indirect participation.²³² However, there are possible situations where a civilian’s particular expertise could have an exceptional and potentially decisive value for the outcome of an armed conflict.²³³ An example would be a computer programmer who researches and writes attack programs, one of which is used to incapacitate the enemy’s network controlling the launch of weapons systems.²³⁴ In this example, the civilian scientist could be responsible for the turning point in the conflict, thus shifting his participation from indirect to direct.²³⁵ The importance of this example is that the State hosting the state-affiliated civilian and the civilian need to understand the possible implications of having the scientist participate, directly or indirectly, in hostilities. Further, the enemy State is going to have to make a call as to whether it can directly target the civilian scientist or attack the military target and consider the scientist collateral damage.\n## B. Non-State-Affiliated Civilians\nNon-state-affiliated civilians, also known as patriotic hackers or hacktivists, are the civilians directly participating in hostilities armed forces’ (presumably those who operate and maintain those systems)—even if they do not actually press the button that launches a cyberattack—are both eligible for prisoner-of-war status and also legitimate military targets for the enemy”).\n²³¹ *Id.*\n²³² *See id.* at 291–92 (stating that “there is a high probability that many, if not most, of the personnel substantively involved in cyber operations may actually be civilians”).\n²³³ *See id.* at 292 (discussing that “[c]omputer technicians, technical maintenance personnel and others who perform similar tasks . . . could thus qualify for inclusion in the limited category of ‘persons who accompany the armed forces without actually being members thereof’”).\n²³⁴ *See id.* at 291 (distinguishing computer programmers who research and write attack programs from operators who execute cyber attacks).\n²³⁵ Turns, *supra* note 62, at 291.\n1048\nN.C. J. INT'L L.\n[Vol. XLII]\non their own volition, so they will likely receive no protection under LOAC. These hackers carry out cyber operations against perceived enemy computer systems, without the control or oversight from their government but seek common political ends.²³⁶ Hacktivists would seem to receive no protection due to their direct participation in hostilities; however, hacktivists could arguably be considered participants in a *levée en masse* if they took up arms spontaneously upon the enemy approaching, lack organization, and carried arms openly.²³⁷ If so, hacktivists would be entitled to POW status, but they could be directly targeted while directly participating in hostilities.²³⁸ The LOAC principles have not been updated for cyber operations, so it is difficult to play out exactly how non-state-affiliated civilians are to be treated during international armed conflicts. Ideally, IHL would be universally understood by states engaged in armed conflict and the non-state-affiliated civilians who choose to directly participate in cyber hostilities would be on notice as to how their actions will be measured.\nAlso, made difficult by the landscape and types of operations carried out in cyberspace is the direct targeting of those individuals directly participating. Aside from anonymity being a difficult hurdle in cyberspace, the determination as to whether a physical attack is justified in response to a cyber action is still theoretical. Furthermore, neither treaties nor customary international law have established the illegality of espionage, either in the physical world or in cyberspace. Thus, civilians conducting CNAs on behalf of a State which is party to an armed conflict may not be directly participating in hostilities. Further, customary international law has not recognized data manipulation and deletions as rising to the level of hostilities, so civilians conducting these types of CNAs would not be directly participating in hostilities.\n## VI. Suggested Treatment For Non-State-Affiliated Civilians\n²³⁶ *Id.* at 293.\n²³⁷ *See id.* (explaining that hacktivists could arguably be assimilated to the rarely used category of *levée en masse*, in which case they would be entitled to POW status if captured, and could also be subject to attack while acting as such a body; [i]n order to meet the legal conditions of a *levée en masse* they would have to “take up arms” spontaneously “on the approach of the enemy”).\n²³⁸ *See id.* (explaining the difficulty of applying the criteria necessary to meet the legal conditions of a *levée en masse* in a cyber-conflict).\n2017 THE TARGETING OF NON-STATE-AFFILIATED CIVILIANS 1049\n# Directly Participating In Cyber Hostilities\nThe principles of LOAC, as they currently exist, govern actions taken in cyberspace as if they occur in the more traditional, physical domain. A major concern with this LOAC application is the effect it has on civilians. As the law of war has evolved, the protection of civilians has been one of the key tenets from the outset. The Fourth Geneva Convention sought to protect civilian persons taking no part in hostilities as well as the wounded and sick.²³⁹ The Convention also prohibited an occupying power from destroying real and personal property belonging to civilians.²⁴⁰ The Additional Protocol I of the Geneva Convention calls for the protection of civilians from unnecessary injury or death and obliges combatants to distinguish themselves from the civilian population while engaged in an attack.²⁴¹ The civilian population is specifically protected under Part IV, which demands the parties to at all times distinguish between civilian population and combatants as well as between civilian objects and military objectives.²⁴² Further, Protocol I prohibits parties from making the civilian population the object of an attack, which also prohibits acts or threats having the intent to terrorize the civilian population.²⁴³\nThe protections provided by LOAC are two-fold. On one hand, they are meant to inform parties to an armed conflict regarding how to conduct themselves while at war. On the other hand, LOAC provides notice to civilians affected by armed conflict as to the treatment they can expect from the parties to the conflict. The relative nuance of cyberspace operations, as compared to traditional warfare, makes difficult the determination of direct participation in hostilities by citizens. If LOAC principles are incapable of adequately putting parties to armed conflict and citizens on notice, it should be amended for this purpose.\n²³⁹ Geneva Convention, supra note 2, art. 15.\n²⁴⁰ Id.\n²⁴¹ Id. art. 44.\n²⁴² Protocol I, supra note 1, art. 48.\n²⁴³ Id. art. 51.\n1050\nN.C. J. INT'L L.\n[Vol. XLII\n## A. Temporal Considerations in the Cyber Domain\nDirect participation in hostilities by civilians operating in the cyber domain is vastly different than participation in the physical domain due to temporal considerations. Actions taken in cyberspace are not easily detected as they are happening, and they are often created for use in the future. For example, computer network attacks involve the use of malicious code to either infect an enemy’s computer system or to exploit weaknesses in the software, system configuration, or security practices.²⁴⁴ Additionally, bots and even botnets are remotely-controlled or semi-autonomous computer programs that infect computers and systems to transmit data obtained by the system or instruct the system to operate a certain way.²⁴⁵ Hackers have even designed ways to exploit computers and systems in a way to launch programs anonymously and autonomously from thousands of infected computers.²⁴⁶ Accordingly, cyber operations differ greatly from physical operations due to the timing of how the operations are carried out. Cyber operations can be set to take place at a certain time in the future or after a certain event has occurred.\nThe ICRC Guidance and the Tallinn Manual both touch on these temporal considerations. The ICRC provides that preparatory acts can be treated as separate acts and distinguished from the act that is the object of the direct participation in hostilities.²⁴⁷ Therefore, a civilian participating in hostilities may\n²⁴⁴ See WILSON, supra note 163, at 39 (explaining the characteristics of malicious code).\n²⁴⁵ Id. at 38 (explaining that “[a]utomated programs, or ‘bots’ . . . are increasingly autonomous, rapid, and difficult to detect . . . [and] can be remotely controlled by commands sent through the Internet and can be activated to operate in a coordinated manner on thousands of computers in different locations around the world”); see id. at 41 (explaining that “[s]ome compromised computers become part of an automatic ‘bot network,’ quietly performing espionage by transmitting data or intermediate preparatory instructions back and forth between compromised computers while awaiting a special final activation signal originating from the attacker”).\n²⁴⁶ See id. at 43 (explaining that “hackers have also designed recent computer exploits that launch anonymously from thousands of infected computers to produce waves of disruption that can quickly overwhelm a targeted organization, or multiple organizations such as a list of banking institutions”).\n²⁴⁷ See Melzer, supra note 90, at 68 (stating that “[w]here the execution of a hostile act does not require geographic displacement, as may be the case with computer network attacks or remote-controlled weapons systems, the duration of direct participation in\n2017 THE TARGETING OF NON-STATE-AFFILIATED CIVILIANS 1051\nconduct a series of acts, each directly participating in hostilities, over a period of time that lead up to the object of the direct participation. The Tallinn Manual provides that the scope of direct participation includes the actions immediately preceding and those subsequent to the qualifying act of direct participation in hostilities.²⁴⁸ The majority of the Tallinn Experts agree that a civilian is directly targetable only for the duration of the direct participation in hostilities, regardless of when the actual effects are realized.²⁴⁹ Yet, some of the experts take the position that the time period during which a civilian can be directly targeted extends for as long as there is a causal link to the intended harm.²⁵⁰ That is, a civilian is targetable as far upstream and as far downstream as that civilian’s causal link exists between the action taken and the intended harm.²⁵¹ As an example, a civilian may be targeted as early as when he begins a cyber operation by probing the enemy’s system and carry through to when he conducts the cyber operation against the system.²⁵² The civilian may even be targeted after the cyber operation, when he is conducting a damage assessment and determining whether to conduct another operation against the system.²⁵³\nThese temporal considerations are worth exploring because they mostly exist only in the cyber context. Accordingly, there may be a disconnect between how States view cyber operations versus operations in the physical world due to the way LOAC principles were developed for the physical world. Though it is possible to parallel these temporal considerations by discussing IEDs emplaced for the destruction of the enemy State’s equipment and the injury of its people, there is not a precise match. While IEDs can be emplaced with the intent of them going off in the future upon being activated, IEDs with this setup cannot be controlled and changed like their logic bomb counterpart in the cyber world. Applying LOAC principles to an IED would yield\n²⁴⁸ TALLINN MANUAL, *supra* note 52, at Rule 35, comment 7.\n²⁴⁹ *Id.* at Rule 35, comment 8.\n²⁵⁰ *Id.* at Rule 35, comment 7.\n²⁵¹ *Id.*\n²⁵² *Id.*\n²⁵³ *Id.*\n1052\nN.C. J. INT'L L.\n[Vol. XLII\nthe bomb maker likely being targetable while building the bomb, based on his intent, and the civilian emplacing the IED being targetable while emplacing the IED. It would not be as clean cut in the cyber world based on the ability of the logic bomb builder and the one who activates it to carry out the entire operation in complete anonymity as well as being able to control the logic bomb once it is emplaced.\nFor the sake of clarifying the discussion below, the civilians being discussed are non-state-affiliated civilians. State-affiliated civilians are those who operate as either private contractors on behalf of the State or as civilian employees, who are employed by the State. These civilians are better aware of their exposure to direct attack based on the nature of their service, which could include operational as well as geographic proximity to armed forces. Thus, the State and the state-affiliated civilians are on notice as to whether and for how long the civilians may be directly targeted by the opposing state during an armed conflict.\nAdditional Protocol I provides that civilians and civilian populations enjoy general protection against dangers arising from military operations.²⁵⁴ However, civilians forfeit this protection if and for so long as they directly participate in hostilities.²⁵⁵ Direct participation by civilians in cyberspace is not always clear. The International Group of Experts was split regarding repeated cyber operations by civilians that qualified as direct participation in hostilities.²⁵⁶ Some of the experts side with ICRC guidance, which provides that each act must be treated separately as separate acts of direct participation.²⁵⁷ Other experts conclude separate direct participation analysis made little operational sense and believe it would create a “revolving door” effect regarding targetability.²⁵⁸ This group of experts believes direct participation by the civilian begins with the first cyber operation he participates in and continues throughout the period of intermittent activity.²⁵⁹ This incongruent application of existing LOAC principles on cyberspace operations demonstrates the potential for civilians and\n²⁵⁴ Protocol I, supra note 1, art. 51.\n²⁵⁵ Id.\n²⁵⁶ TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 52, Rule 35, comment 7.\n²⁵⁷ Id.\n²⁵⁸ Id.\n²⁵⁹ Id.\n2017 THE TARGETING OF NON-STATE-AFFILIATED CIVILIANS 1053\nparties to an armed conflict to misapply or misinterpret LOAC principles.\nWhat if a non-state-affiliated civilian were to create an autonomous logic bomb and release it with the intent to infiltrate and attack the computer network of the defense ministry of a State which is party to an ongoing armed conflict? At what point could the civilian be targeted by the State? If the State discovers the logic bomb months after it was released by the civilian, and assuming the State can attribute it to the civilian, can the State target the civilian then? Under ICRC guidance, the civilian could be directly targeted for each act of direct participation in hostilities.²⁶⁰ Accordingly, the civilian could be directly attacked when producing the logic bomb with the intent to launch a CNA against the State, if done so in support of another party to the conflict, and when the civilian actually launches the logic bomb.²⁶¹ However, ICRC guidance would not likely support a direct attack against the civilian if discovered months after it was launched. Under the Tallinn Manual’s viewpoint, the civilian may be directly targeted.²⁶²\nAs discussed above, it may be unclear to civilians directly participating in hostilities in the cyber domain as to how their actions could be interpreted by parties to an armed conflict. Aside from civilians conducting intermittent direct participation in hostilities in cyberspace, civilians may also be unclear as to their exposure for direct targeting due to the uncertain application of LOAC principles to the cyber domain. Specifically, civilians launching autonomous or semi-autonomous programs to attack computer networks may directly participate in hostilities by building the code and program for the specific purpose as well as directly participate by launching the CNA.²⁶³ However, these civilians may at some point decide they no longer wish to pursue the action against a party to an armed conflict.\n²⁶⁰ JEAN-MARIE HENCKAERTS &amp; LOUISE DOSWALD-BECK, CUSTOMARY INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW VOL. 1: RULES 1, 21 (2005).\n²⁶¹ Id.\n²⁶² Id. at 23.\n²⁶³ Turns, supra note 62, at 281.\n1054\nN.C. J. INT'L L.\n[Vol. XLII\n## B. Change of Heart for Civilians Directly Participating in Cyber Hostilities\nHow might a civilian make clear to a State embroiled in an armed conflict that the civilian who conducted a cyber operation against the State no longer wishes to directly participate in cyber hostilities? In the physical domain, the civilian would simply stop shooting at the party, collecting arms to use against the party, building bombs to emplace in roadways, or collecting money to finance attacks against the party to the conflict.²⁶⁴ An example which could parallel the cyber domain would be a civilian bomb maker who makes a bomb and emplaces that bomb in a road in an effort to target a party to an armed conflict. However, the bomb maker could make clear his intentions to no longer directly participate by putting up a sign warning of the bomb, digging up the bomb, or telling the party the location of the bomb. In cyberspace, a civilian who creates the malicious code for the CNA and launches it may not be able to recall the code or stop the cyber operation once it has begun.²⁶⁵ Once the malicious code is discovered, the targeted State may attack the civilian because it is impossible to precisely determine if the civilian has stopped directly participating in cyber hostilities. The State could argue the civilian is still monitoring and directing the logic bomb or malicious code.\nThe advanced technology which enables civilians to directly participate in hostilities could make it difficult for both the civilian and the party to the armed conflict to know when the civilian is no longer directly participating.²⁶⁶ The civilian who produces the malicious code for a CNA concludes his direct participation when he stops working on or even finishes the code. Would the civilian who launches the malicious code for a CNA conclude his direct participation when the code is launched? What if the malicious code were autonomous or semi-autonomous, and it would continue to operate without the aid from the civilian? This would seem to be a magic bullet fired in the physical world. In the physical domain, the bullet would lose speed and fall to the earth. However, malicious code launched in the cyber domain may\n²⁶⁴ *Id.*\n²⁶⁵ *Id.*\n²⁶⁶ *Id.*\n2017 THE TARGETING OF NON-STATE-AFFILIATED CIVILIANS 1055\ncontinue until it is discovered and counter by the attacked party or until it reaches its termination stage, if it has one. May the civilian launching this code be directly targeted until the malicious code ceases to operate as part of the CNA?\nCurrent interpretations by the ICRC and the International Group of Experts contributing to the Tallinn Manual apply IHL to the cyber domain and determine that the civilian launching the CNA code can only be targeted so long as he is directly participating in hostilities, which is when he is actively engaged.²⁶⁷ The ICRC and the Group of Experts are unwilling to extend the window of targetability to include ongoing hostilities set in motion by the individual unleashing the malicious code aimed at conducting a CNA.²⁶⁸ As previously stated in the magic bullet analogy, there is nothing to stop the CNA code except for the initiator, unless the attacked State becomes aware of the CNA and takes steps to defend against it. Accordingly, should not the attacked State be able to target the civilian initiator after he has set in motion the CNA? If the State is able to stretch the targetability window to legally target the initiating civilian so long as the CNA is underway, can the civilian limit his exposure in any way?\nA solution might be found in the American Law Institute’s Model Penal Code (“MPC”). The MPC defines criminal conspiracy as a person conspiring with another person or group of persons to commit a crime if the individual, with the purpose of promoting or facilitating the crime: 1) agrees with the other person or group that one or more of them will engage in conduct constituting a crime; or 2) agrees to aid the other person or group in planning or committing the crime.²⁶⁹ However, the actor may, after having conspired to commit a crime, use as an affirmative defense the fact that the actor thwarted the success of the conspiracy after having manifested a complete and voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.²⁷⁰ By renouncing his support for the crime and thwarting the success of the conspiracy, the actor is able to undo the effort he put into conspiring to commit the crime.\n²⁶⁷ Eva Knopova, *New IHL Framework for Cyber Warfare: Master’s Thesis*, CHARLES UNIV. PRAGUE DEP’T INT’L L. 47 (2016).\n²⁶⁸ Id.\n²⁶⁹ American Law Institute, *MODEL PENAL CODE § 5.03* (Tent. Draft No. 4, 1955).\n²⁷⁰ Id.\n1056\nN.C. J. INT'L L.\n[Vol. XLII]\nAs applied to the above issue regarding civilians directly participating in cyber hostilities, a civilian putting into place malicious code capable of autonomously conducting a CNA may be able to be certain he cannot be directly targeted by the party to an armed conflict by renouncing his support for the cyber hostilities and working to thwart further cyber hostilities by the code.²⁷¹ By attempting to prevent future direct targeting, the civilian may inadvertently leave himself exposed to attack by making his actions and identity known to the party. However, a party to an armed conflict abiding by LOAC would not be able to target a civilian who is no longer participating in hostilities.²⁷² Further, the civilian may take similar actions to renounce his participation and thwart further action by the code in an anonymous way.\nBy adopting this view, States who are a party to an armed conflict have better ground rules as to how to legally target non-state-affiliated civilians who are participating in cyber hostilities in a way that may not be covered by current IHL.²⁷³ Additionally, under this view, civilians will have a better understanding of how their actions, carried out as cyber operations, will be treated by States who are a party to an armed conflict. This view provides States and civilians with notice of how actions by civilians will be treated in cyberspace. Further, this view provides civilians who have participated in cyber hostilities, and who may be determined to be still participating based on the autonomous CNA code the individual initiated, an opportunity to remove themselves from hostilities. By taking steps discussed in the MPC to remove oneself from a conspiracy, the initiating individual can undo the bonds currently opening himself up to being targeted by a party to the conflict.²⁷⁴\nBy coming forward, renouncing his support for the ongoing cyber hostilities, and attempting to thwart the object of the cyber\n²⁷¹ HENCKAERTS &amp; DOSWALD-BECK, supra note 260, at 19–20.\n²⁷² See generally INT’L &amp; OPERATIONAL L.

The civilian directly taking part in cyber hostilities, favoring a party to an armed conflict by conducting cyber operations against an opponent party, also exposes himself to domestic criminal law pertaining to the cyber operations. By coming forward, the civilian may be opening himself up to prosecution under domestic criminal law in an effort to prevent being directly targeted by the State against whom the civilian directly participated in hostilities.²⁷⁶ This may create a disincentive for civilians to expose themselves as ongoing direct participants in cyber hostilities, but the damage is already done.\nThe only question that remains is attribution. Can the attacked State determine who the civilian is for either direct targeting purposes or domestic criminal prosecution? If the civilian believes so, the civilian could limit his exposure to being directly attacked as well as request leniency from the domestic criminal prosecution for his cooperation.²⁷⁷ The alternative is for the civilian to figure out a way to completely remove every trace of his participation in an ongoing cyber operation, thereby ensuring the attacked State does not discover the cyber operation, attribute it to the civilian, and directly attack him.²⁷⁸\nWithout this possible outlet, civilians who have had a change of heart and no longer wish to participate in cyber hostilities may be targeted in the future for previous participation in cyber hostilities, of which they no longer wish to be a part. Though not a perfect method for keeping civilians safe from being directly targeted, this method provides notice to the attacking State of the civilian’s previous acts, which are the acts the civilian no longer wishes to be held accountable for in the realm of armed conflict. The civilian’s renouncing of previous participation in hostilities will not absolve him of domestic law implications, but it will ensure he is not targeted in the future.²⁷⁹\n275 Turns, supra note 62, at 281.\n276 Id.\n277 Melzer, supra note 90, at 83.\n278 Id.\n279 Id.\n1058\nN.C. J. INT'L L.\n[Vol. XLII]\n# VII. Conclusion\nCivilians directly participate in hostilities for numerous reasons. State-affiliated civilians might engage in direct participation as part of their job; non-state-affiliated civilians might directly participate out of a sense of patriotism, helping the underdog, or feeling like part of the fight. Cyberspace creates an environment unlike any other ever seen before, so civilians and States who are a party to an armed conflict struggle to understand how LOAC principles apply to their conduct. A misunderstanding by a civilian could lead to a prolonged period of being directly targeted by a party to a conflict; a misunderstanding by that party could lead to allegations of war crimes. All sides to a conflict, to include civilians, would benefit from consensus in the application of LOAC to the cyber domain.\nA consensus in the application of LOAC principles in the cyber domain could lead to stronger footing for States and citizens as the cyberspace domain becomes a larger battleground. Cyberspace issues such as anonymity, attribution, temporal considerations, and equal application of force between the physical and cyber domains all highlight the need to better define LOAC applications to the cyber domain.²⁸⁰ Specifically, civilians should be able to renounce their direct participation in cyber hostilities, and they should no longer face direct targeting by a party to a conflict for cyber operations taken previously. The Tallinn Manual spells out that civilians may be directly targeted so long as their causal link to the action exists.²⁸¹ States subscribing to this view may link civilians to cyber operations carried out previously, even after civilians have walked away and no longer desire to directly participate.\nThe ability to target civilians for previous acts of cyber hostilities when States believe a causal link still exists may lead to an expanded window of time during which a civilian may be targeted. Thus, States who are party to a conflict should be able to know with certainty that the civilian they intend to target is a lawful target, due to the civilian’s ongoing intent to directly participate in hostilities. The renunciation clause found in the Model Penal Code could be the solution to ending\n²⁸⁰ Turns, supra note 62, at 281.\n²⁸¹ Id.\n2017 THE TARGETING OF NON-STATE-AFFILIATED CIVILIANS 1059\nmisunderstandings by civilians and parties to a conflict regarding direct participation and targeting.²⁸²\nUnder this view, civilians have a way to guarantee they will no longer be directly targeted for past cyber operations amounting to direct participation in hostilities when the State may not know the civilian’s participation has concluded. In addition, this view provides an out for States directly targeting civilians for directly participating in cyber hostilities against the State because the civilian has the opportunity and incentive to come clean if the civilian no longer wishes to directly participate. By coming forward, civilians may open themselves up to domestic prosecution, but they guarantee they will not be directly targeted by a State.\nA final point is examined by asking: should civilians have to go to such lengths to ensure they will not be directly targeted by a State for previous instances of direct participation in hostilities? Further, should LOAC require citizens to take active steps to put States on notice as to the citizens’ activities to prevent being illegally targeted after the direct participation in hostilities has concluded? An argument can be made that this policy would be requiring too much of civilians, and it exposes civilians to a lose-lose scenario.\nOn the one hand, civilians want to ensure the temporal anomalies in the cyber domain do not mislead States into falsely believing civilians are continuing to directly participate in hostilities after participation has ended. On the other, civilians want to protect against domestic prosecution and initiating an investigation into their activities. Though a possible solution to the issue of civilians being overly or illegally targeted could be found in the Model Penal Code, international law may not be willing to support the process or potential side effects to civilians providing notice to States that the civilians have withdrawn from the direct participation in hostilities.\n282 Id.\n^{}[]",

Introduction\nThe Law of Armed Conflict (“LOAC”) has evolved over the past century and a half to protect civilians from the harms caused by war as well as to put all parties on notice as to their expected conduct. Civilians, like any other group, are not prohibited from directly participating in hostilities, but they lose their protection from being directly targeted for such time as they chose to do so. This protection for civilians is easier understood as it is applied to the physical domain, for which it was created. The cyber domain is vastly different. Accordingly, civilians and States who are party to international armed conflicts are left to apply their own understanding of how LOAC principles should be applied to the cyber domain.\nThe difference of interpretation by civilians and parties to armed conflict could leave civilians overly exposed to direct attack and parties accountable for war crimes. This is especially true for non-state-affiliated civilians conducting cyber hostilities against a State that is party to an armed conflict. The differentiation between state-affiliated and non-state-affiliated civilians matters, because state-affiliated civilians should understand they may be injured or killed based on their work alongside and their proximity to armed forces. Thus, they are likely on notice that they may be directly targeted if directly participating in hostilities as well as considered collateral damage during a legal attack by an enemy State. In addition, civilians may open themselves up to an extended period of time during which they may be directly targeted based on the type of cyber operation they conduct.\nVarying views support the notion that civilians intermittently participating directly in hostilities may be targeted throughout a linked-together period of participation. Further, if a civilian were to launch against a State a cyber operation that activates at a set point in the future or after a forecasted event, the State could possibly treat the civilian as directly participating in hostilities long after the civilian actually initiated and participated in the cyber operation. This delayed direct targeting of the civilian can happen either because the State is unaware of exactly when the cyber operation was launched against it or because it interprets its\n Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts, June 8, 1977, 110 Stat. 2104, 1125 U.N.T.S. 51 [hereinafter Protocol I].\n\nresponse as warranted under LOAC.\nAlong with opening themselves up to being directly targeted, civilians participating in cyber hostilities may also face domestic criminal law exposure for their cyber hostilities. States that are party to an armed conflict could seek to lawfully target the civilian rather than await a domestic law prosecution. A possible solution to civilians being overly exposed to direct attack for their decision to directly participate in cyber hostilities could come from the Model Penal Code’s view of renouncing one’s role and thwarting the overall success of the act. Under this theory, a civilian could make the enemy State aware of the civilian’s plot to conduct an ongoing cyber operation against the State in an effort to absolve the civilian of being targeted in the future. However, these civilians may still face domestic criminal law repercussions for doing so.\n## II. The Treatment of Civilians in Traditional Warfare\nWhether it is their own loss of life or injury, the loss or injury of a relative, or the collateral damage of their property, civilians always suffer during war. Accordingly, major nation states have been working together for over a century to address the way traditional wars are fought, and they have sought to add a sense of humanity and require discrimination in targeting. In 1949, major nation states acceded to the Fourth Geneva Convention, which was called “The Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War” and sought to protect noncombatants.\nPrior to the Geneva Conventions, civilians were left to the mercy of the combatants and their beliefs as to sparing civilians. The Geneva Conventions codified what had been inching closer to customary law for decades. The movement in this direction can be seen by the Lieber Code, which sought to regulate war; and later the Declaration of St. Petersburg in 1868, which prohibited the use of specific weapons for humanitarian reasons. The\n Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, Aug. 12, 1949, 110 Stat. 2104, 75 U.N.T.S. 287 [hereinafter Geneva Convention].\n See ANICÉE VAN ENGELAND, CIVILIAN OR COMBATANT?: A CHALLENGE FOR THE 21ST CENTURY ix-xix (2011).\n Id.\n Id. at 13–14.\n\n[Vol. XLII]\ninternational agreement formed at the 1874 Brussels Convention discussed laws and customs of war and provided that combatant forces are not granted unlimited power as to how to injure the enemy. This provision was later codified in the Hague Regulations of 1907, as was the general understanding of the need for discrimination between civilians and combatants. Additionally, the Hague Peace Conferences of 1899 and 1907 became the first internationally codified documents providing that civilians should not suffer from the effects of hostilities.\n## A. Geneva Convention and the Additional Protocol\nThe Fourth Geneva Convention, which occurred in 1949, specifically sought to protect civilians during times of war. Under the Fourth Geneva Convention, persons taking no active part in the hostilities are to be treated humanely and without regard to their faith, sex, race, or religion. In addition, parties to the conflict are to establish neutral zones in regions of combat to shelter wounded and sick combatants and civilians taking no part in hostilities from the effects of war. The wounded and the sick are specifically protected and should be provided particular care and respect.\nIn addition to the Fourth Geneva Convention, the Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (“Additional Protocol I”) is a 1977 amendment to the Geneva Convention that focuses on the protection of victims of international armed conflicts. Protocol I calls for the protection and care of the wounded, sick, and shipwrecked regardless of whether they are military or civilians. To protect civilians from unnecessary injury or death, Protocol I obliges combatants to distinguish themselves from the civilian population while engaged\n *Id.*\n *Id.*\n *Id.*\n See Geneva Convention, *supra* note 2.\n *Id.* art. 3.\n *Id.* art. 14.\n *Id.*\n Protocol I, *supra* note 1, art. 3.\n *Id.*\n\nin an attack. The civilian population is specifically protected under Part IV, which demands the parties to distinguish at all times between civilian populations and combatants; as well as between civilian objects and military objectives. Further, Protocol I provides that if there is doubt as to whether a person is a civilian, that person should be treated as a civilian. In addition, parties are prohibited from making the civilian population the object of an attack, or making acts or threats intended to terrorize the civilian population.\nProtocol I also protects civilians by prohibiting indiscriminate attacks such as those not directed at a specific military objective as well as the use of combat means that cannot be sufficiently limited. However, there are limits because the presence or movement of civilians will not render certain areas immune from military operations. For example, if a party to the conflict uses a movement of civilians to shield military objects, that party would be in violation of the Protocol. The purpose of the Additional Protocol is to protect civilians during armed conflicts, so a State using civilians as shields will be held accountable for the LOAC violation. In addition, the Hague Convention states that the right of belligerents to adopt means of injuring the enemy is not unlimited. By limiting the means used against the enemy, civilians are also protected from unnecessary suffering due to the type of weapons used in warfare. The purpose of the Hague Convention was to infuse humanity into armed conflicts. By forcing States to use approved weapons, which take into account human suffering, civilians are indirectly protected from inhumane weaponry.\nProtocol I requires precautionary measures to be taken during\n\n[Vol. XLII\nattack planning to limit the injury and death of civilians, as well as damage to civilian objects. Specifically, Article 57 instructs parties to take constant care in military operations to spare civilians and civilian objects by requiring parties to verify objectives to be attacked and to take all feasible precautions to avoid and minimize incidental loss of civilian life or injury. The parties must also refrain from launching any attack that may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, civilian injury, or loss of civilian property. Further, parties are required to cancel or suspend attacks if it becomes clear the objective is not a military one or that the attack will cause loss of civilian life or property or will cause civilian injuries. Protocol I also requires parties, to the maximum extent feasible, remove civilians and civilian objects from the vicinity of military objects. In addition, parties are to avoid locating military objects within or near densely populated areas. The purpose of these measures are to ensure States are being mindful of civilians and civilian property from the beginning of attack planning all the way through the attacks themselves.\n## B. Civilians Directly Participating in Hostilities\nProtocol I protects civilians when viewed as innocent bystanders, but what if civilians participate in hostilities? Under the Protocol, parties to an international armed conflict may only target civilians for such time as the civilians take a direct part in hostilities. At that point, the civilians lose their civilian status protection and can then be targeted by combatants as legally permissible. The timeframe for which civilians can be targeted while directly participating in hostilities is defined by Protocol I as the time during which they are participating. However, it is important to keep in mind that the right of the noncombatant population to protection involves a corresponding duty to abstain\n\nfrom hostilities.\nAs an example, if a civilian who is caught in the middle of an international armed conflict decides to pick up a rifle and shoot at a Party to the conflict, the Party’s armed force may target the civilian so long as the civilian poses a threat. If the civilian were to drop the rifle and run back to his house, he could no longer be targeted by the armed force. The targeting of civilians while directly participating in hostilities is rooted in LOAC; any potential domestic law violations would be determined by the civilian’s State. Civilians directly participating in hostilities may face repercussions based on their actions that violate domestic criminal laws as well as being targeted by the enemy State. The Third Geneva Convention also addresses civilians participating in hostilities.\nThe Third Geneva Convention (“Convention”) was adopted in 1949, and its purpose was the protection of the victims of war, both civilian and prisoner. This Convention mainly addresses the treatment of prisoners of war, but it also recognizes civilian participation in hostilities. Under this Convention, *levée en masse* is the spontaneous taking up of arms by civilian inhabitants of a non-occupied territory when the invading enemy approaches. In this case, the civilians would be allowed prisoner-of-war status because they participated in hostilities spontaneously, without the time to form themselves into regular armed units; but they must carry arms openly and respect the laws of war. Aside from prisoner of war status, LOAC also addresses combatant immunity and targetability.\nCombatant immunity is addressed in Protocol I, wherein it states that members of a Party’s armed force are combatants, and\n Karma Nabulsi, *Evolving Conceptions of Civilians and Belligerents: One Hundred Years After the Hague Peace Conferences, in CIVILIANS IN WAR 9, 16* (Simon Chesterman ed., 2001) (quoting Henry Richmond Droop, *On the Relations Between an Invading Army and the Inhabitants, and the Conditions Under Which Irregular Troops Are Entitled to the Same Treatment as Regular Soldiers*, TRANSACTIONS OF THE GROTIUS SOCIETY 713 (1871)).\n Geneva Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War art. 4, Aug. 12, 1949, 6 U.S.T. 3316, 75 U.N.T.S. 135 [hereinafter Geneva POW].\n *Id.*\n *Id.*\n *Id.*\n See Protocol I, supra note 1.\n\n[Vol. XLII]\nthey have the right to participate directly in hostilities. The term “combatant” excludes medical personnel, chaplains, and civilians. Accordingly, in international armed conflict, combatants enjoy immunity regarding their acts as part of hostilities, but it does not prohibit others from engaging in those types of hostilities. Although non-combatants are not specifically prohibited from engaging in hostilities during an armed conflict, they may be directly targeted by the enemy and may face domestic criminal charges for their actions. Therefore, civilians engaging in hostilities would not be entitled to the combatant immunity that is given to combatants participating in an international armed conflict. Thus, civilians would only be entitled to prisoner of war status in limited cases, and they would not be entitled to combatant immunity.\nRegarding targetability, civilians are not to be targeted by the parties to an armed conflict, and civilians are to be generally protected against the dangers arising from military operations. However, LOAC allows civilians to be targeted by an armed force if and for so long as the civilian is directly participating in hostilities. Therefore, civilians enjoy the freedom from targetability so long as they are not taking a direct part in the hostilities. This freedom from direct targetability extends to a point under LOAC. A State choosing to target a legal military objective must determine if civilians and their property may be damaged by the attack. If so, the State must conduct a balancing test to ensure the necessity of taking out the military objective outweighs the possible damage that could be caused to civilians and their property. In summation, civilians do not have combatant immunity, they may be granted prisoner of war status during a levée en masse, and they cannot be directly targeted unless they are directly participating in hostilities.\nEven with the existence of International Humanitarian Law (“IHL”) seeking to protect civilians during times of war, civilians\n\nstill experience loss. IHL exists with the purpose of protecting civilians during an ongoing armed conflict, but civilians can still be legally killed or injured. If done according to the Geneva Conventions’ rules of discrimination and proportionality, nations may still strike enemy targets that lead to the loss of limbs, lives, and loved ones for civilians. As examples, fighter jets can strike a weapons cache next to an apartment complex, a convoy can speed through a school playground, and combatants can return fire in a crowded street. Aside from a country’s stance on ethics in times of war, the plight of civilians has practical drawbacks, such as the hatred survivors have toward foreign governments and protests following civilian casualties. The United States military came to understand that it is important to win the hearts and minds of the civilian population in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Based on the implications that the United States was callously indifferent regarding civilian casualties, it started tracking the damage it caused and responded directly to affected families. The efforts by the U.S. government to recognize the importance of paying respect to the families of injured or killed civilians is another step toward protecting civilians during times of war.\nInternational Humanitarian Law provides the basis for the protection of civilians during an ongoing armed conflict, but does that translate from the physical world to the cyber world? The cyberspace domain offers capabilities that are far different from the physical domain. Cyberspace provides the cloak of anonymity that may shield civilians and even States from being identified as the responsible party for cyber operations. The protections afforded to civilians have been roughly translated from the physical to the cyber domain by the Tallinn Manual’s International Group of Experts as well as Guidance by the International Committee of the Red Cross.\n### III. The Current Treatment of Civilians in the Cyberspace\n *Id.*\n Sarah Holewinski, *Do Less Harm: Protecting and Compensating Civilians in War*, FOREIGN AFF., Jan.–Feb. 2013, at 14.\n *Id.*\n *Id.*\n *Id.*\n *Id.*\n\n[Vol. XLII\n## Domain\nCivilians enjoy very much the same protections in the cyberspace domain as they do in the physical domain. The Tallinn Manual states that civilians are defined in the cyberspace domain as they are under the Additional Protocol I of the Geneva Convention. Specifically, civilians are defined in terms of neither being members of armed forces nor members of a *levée en masse*. As such, individual civilians, as well as civilian populations, shall not be the object of a cyber-attack by a party to the armed conflict. A cyber-attack is any cyber operation or activity that is reasonably expected to cause injury or death to a person or the damage or destruction to objects. In addition, LOAC applies to the targeting of people or objects during an armed conflict regardless of the means or methods of warfare that are used. These seemingly broad definitions are key to protecting civilians during armed conflicts because parties to the conflict are held accountable for actions taken which are incompatible with the law of war.\n## A. Cyber Operations and the Law of Armed Conflict\nDefining cyber warfare, as a whole, is better understood by looking at its component parts. Cyberspace, in general, is the domain within the information environment made up of the interdependent network of information technology infrastructures and the resident data. Cyber warfare can be viewed as a combined concept of cyberspace operations, offensive cyberspace operations, and defensive cyberspace operations. Cyber operations are the employment of cyberspace capabilities where the primary purpose is to achieve objectives in and through\n TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE 104-05 (Michael N. Schmitt, ed. 2013) [hereinafter TALLINN MANUAL].\n *Id.*\n *Id.* at 113–14.\n *Id.* at 106–10.\n *Id.* at 104–05.\n *Cyber*, DICTIONARY OF MILITARY AND ASSOCIATED TERMS, U.S. DEP’T DEFENSE 57–58 (8 Nov. 2010 as amended through 15 Feb. 2016), http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/new_pubs/jp1_02.pdf [https://perma.cc/5UH8-B36A].\n *Id.*\n\ncyberspace. Offensive cyberspace operations are those intended to project power by the application of force in and through cyberspace.\nDefensive cyberspace operations are the passive and active cyberspace operations carried out to preserve the ability to use friendly cyberspace capabilities to protect data, networks, and other systems. Examples of cyber warfare include the gaining of access to a computer system to acquire control over it, transmission of viruses to destroy or alter data, use of logic bombs to sit idle in a system until a set time or occurrence, and insertion of a worm to reproduce until a system is overloaded. Understanding cyber warfare allows for a better understanding of how the LOAC principles are to be applied in the cyber domain.\nThe LOAC principles of proportionality, humanity, military necessity, and distinction apply to States operating in cyberspace in very much the same way as they apply in the physical domains. However, conducting operations in the cyber domain complicates the process because the operations are being carried out in an environment that is unreal and inherently unstable. Targeting for computer network attacks presents legal issues that are just as complex as physical attacks. Accordingly, States must exercise caution when planning and carrying out operations in cyberspace to ensure civilians are being protected. To do so, States conduct network reconnaissance for both operational requirements, as well as to ensure planned attacks do not cause collateral damage and casualties outside of what is acceptable under LOAC principles.\n Id.\n Id.\n Id.\n David Turns, *Cyber Warfare and the Notion of Direct Participation in Hostilities*, 17 J.

INT’L L. 391 (2010).\n Id.\n\n[Vol. XLII\nThere are some scholars and experts who view cyber operations as falling outside of the reach of the UN Charter or LOAC. Due to the UN Charter being written long before the advent of the Internet, the UN Charter was not written with a clear intention of including cyber operations. Scholars and experts adhering to this view believe the UN Charter encompasses only physical attacks, and cyber operations will almost certainly not involve the use of physical force. According to this line of thought, a country would not violate LOAC by deliberately launching cyber operations at civilian-owned targets. However, the Tallinn Manual examines cyber operations as falling under the UN Charter and being subject to LOAC.\nThe LOAC principle of distinction, as codified in Additional Protocol I, and incorporated into the Tallinn Manual, requires that parties to an armed conflict distinguish between the civilian population and combatants, as well as between civilian objects and military objectives. This requirement seeks to protect civilians and their property by holding the parties to armed conflict accountable for the targets they choose to attack. Further, the principle of distinction precludes any rationale or justification by a party for an attack not permitted by LOAC. In cases where there is doubt as to whether a person is a civilian in the cyber domain, that person shall be considered a civilian. This requirement complicates the cyber battlefield, because there are many civilians using computers and computer networks, and it may be very difficult to discern who is and is not a civilian.\nDetermining whether actors in the cyberspace domain are civilians, and may possibly be targeted when directly participating in hostilities during an international armed conflict, is difficult. Inaccurate attribution in cyberspace may leave vulnerable the civilians caught in the crossfire. The International Court of Justice maintains high standards for requisite attribution of an armed attack, and in the cyber domain, attribution for the act and actor\n See Cyber, supra note 57.\n Id.\n Id.\n See TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 52.\n Geneva Convention, supra note 2, art. 14; Geneva POW, supra note 34, art. 4.\n TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 52, at Rule 33.\n Id.\n\nare difficult to prove with scientific certainty. Further, this attribution on the Internet is “the most technologically challenging level of attribution,” because the attributing party is seeking “to determine the original individual or entity that is responsible for launching the attack.”\nIn the United States, the White House, State Department, and Department of Defense recognize the need to treat cyber operations as potentially falling under the UN Charter and requiring a LOAC determination prior to employment. Specifically, there is concern from these agencies that the use of cyber weapons could trigger unintended consequences and might harm diplomatic relations. Senior military officials have stated that attribution of cyber-attacks has remained a challenge, and that challenge factors into the difficulty of determining what constitutes a cyber act of war. Further, the National Security Director and U.S. Cyber Command chief has stated that the United States needs to think outside of the cyber realm regarding retaliation, and it needs to define acceptability limits regarding hacking. In addition, the United States needs to prepare a set of capabilities and show its determination for using them. Members of the U.S. Congress have echoed the need for cyber deterrence\n See Jason F.

The National Security Director and Cyber Command Chief has stated that anything the United States does in the cyber arena must follow LOAC, so cyber responses must be proportional and in line with historical norms. Further, cyberspace capabilities and operations parallel those in the physical domain, but cyber represents a different technical application in an attempt to achieve some of the exact same effects. Additionally, the development of cyber weapons represents the next evolutionary step in warfare, so it possesses all of the ethical concerns posed by similar weapons developed in the past. Therefore, the United States places great importance on maintaining compliance with LOAC even though cyber capabilities and operations were not planned for by the LOAC founders.\n## B. The Objects of Cyber Attacks\nThe Tallinn Manual also discusses who may be made the object of cyber-attacks and lists them as: 1) members of the armed forces; 2) members of organized armed groups; 3) civilians taking a direct part in hostilities; and 4) participants in a *levée en masse* during an international armed conflict. It should be noted that the first two categories can be made the object of an attack based on their status; however, the last two categories can only be made targets based on their actions. Members of organized armed\n *Id.*\n *Id.*\n Patrick Tucker, *NSA Chief: Rules of War Apply to Cyberwar*, Too, DEF.

The Tallinn Manual’s International Group of Experts were split over whether mere membership in such a group suffices or whether members would be required to show a continuous combat function. The continuous combat function is a requirement provided by the International Committee of the Red Cross in its guidance. This guidance requires the organized armed group to belong to a party to the conflict, demonstrated by conducting hostilities on behalf and with the agreement of the party. Further, members of the organized armed groups demonstrate their membership only by assuming continuous functions for the group, which involves direct participation in hostilities.\nThe second two categories of individuals who can be made the object of a cyber-attack are civilians who directly participate in hostilities, which will be addressed below, and participants in a levée en masse during an international armed conflict. Inhabitants of unoccupied territory during an international armed conflict who engage in cyber operations as part of a levée en masse are afforded combatant immunity and prisoner of war status. In addition, participants in a cyber-based levée en masse are targetable throughout the period of their participation therein. To be considered a levée en masse, the participating individuals must be inhabitants of non-occupied territory, who upon the invading enemy’s approach, take up arms to resist them. In the cyber context, “taking up arms” refers to engaging in cyber operations against the enemy.\nThis “taking up arms” in cyberspace is theoretical based on the facts that would have to exist for a cyber levée en masse to be\n *Id.*\n *Id.*\n Nils Melzer, *Interpretive Guidance on the Notion of Direct Participation Under International Humanitarian Law*, INT’L COMM.

However, this levée en masse is still required to carry arms openly and respect the laws and customs of war, though they are not required to wear identifying attire. In the cyber domain, a levée en masse could occur if, in response to a physical invasion, members of the population spontaneously mount cyber operations against the invaders. Further, the International Group of Experts are divided as to whether levée en masse privileges can apply to a civilian population engaged in countering a massive cyber-attack in lieu of a physical invasion.\nIn general, civilians should be protected in the cyberspace domain in much the same way as they are protected in the physical domains. The difference is the virtually untested nature of the cyberspace domain. It remains unclear exactly how States are to behave in cyberspace, what rises to the level of a cyber-attack, and what level of physical domain response is authorized for a particular cyber-attack. These and other unresolved translations from the physical realm to the cyber domain make difficult the protection of civilians during an international armed conflict. A step further would be the impact on civilians when they decide to directly participate in cyber hostilities.\n## IV. Civilians Directly Participating in Hostilities in the Cyberspace Domain\nThe Tallinn Manual provides that, based on LOAC principles, there is no bar of any category of person from participating in cyber operations, whether during an international or non-international armed conflict. However, civilians participating in an armed conflict through cyber operations would likely not be entitled to prisoner of war status and combatant immunity, and they could be targeted based on their participation. The\n *Id.*\n Geneva POW, *supra* note 34, art. 4.\n *Id.*\n *Id.*\n *Id.*\n TALLINN MANUAL, *supra* note 52, at Rule 25.\n *Id.* at Rule 25, comment 2.\n\nentitlement to combatant immunity and prisoner of war status are dependent upon the individual being engaged in an international armed conflict, as opposed to solely a non-international armed conflict or actions not rising to the level of armed conflict. Even if civilians participate in hostilities, the majority of the International Group of Experts agree that civilians retain their civilian status. However, civilians remain subject to prosecution under the applicable domestic laws of the States capturing them.\n## A. Defining Direct Participation in Hostilities\nAs previously mentioned, civilians can be made the object of cyber-attacks if they are directly taking part in hostilities. Though civilians are protected from attack during international armed conflicts, they lose that protection if and for so long as they directly participate in hostilities. This protection from attack and subsequent loss of protection only applies to civilians; it does not apply to members of armed forces, organized armed groups, or participants in a *levée en masse*. Further, members of groups failing to qualify as organized armed groups would also qualify as civilians under this rule. For example, a group would fail to be recognized as an organized armed group if they lack the required level of organization or if they fail to maintain a continuous combat function.\nConducting operations in cyberspace that may rise to the level of direct participation in hostilities can be better understood by looking at the functions or tasks carried out in the cyber domain. Those involved in cyber operations seemingly fall in to three main categories according to their functions: 1) those who design or write the programs used for offense or defensive cyber operations; 2) those who install these programs on computer systems, act as service administrators, and provide technical maintenance; and 3)\n *Id.* at Rule 25.\n *Id.* at Rule 29.\n *Id.* at Rule 29.\n *Id.* at Rules 32, 35.\n Geneva POW, *supra* note 34, art. 4; TALLINN MANUAL, *supra* note 52, at Rule 35.\n *Id.*\n *Id.* art. 4; Melzer, *supra* note 90, at Part I.2.b.\n\n[Vol. XLII\nthose who actually operate the computer programs. A lone civilian could presumably be filling all of these roles in a solo operation.\nWhen civilians directly participate in hostilities through cyber operations during an international armed conflict, they are liable to be attacked either through cyber means or other lawful means under LOAC. IHL does not define direct participation in hostilities, so direct participation must be interpreted in good faith according to the ordinary meaning and the context based on the object and purpose of IHL. Treaty law in this area refers to hostilities in terms of international or non-international armed conflict, so that should be the threshold; hostilities cannot refer to internal disturbances, riots, or isolated and sporadic events. Not all conduct during an armed conflict constitutes part of hostilities. Civilian participation in hostilities can occur in various forms and intensity levels in a wide variety of geographical, cultural, political, and military contexts, so the circumstances at the relevant time and place of the hostilities should be examined.\nThe direct participation in hostilities refers to specific acts, which are carried out by individuals as part of the hostilities between two parties in an armed conflict. There are therefore two elements: 1) direct participation; and 2) hostilities. Participation in hostilities can either be direct or indirect; direct participation is the engagement in specific hostile acts. The concept of hostilities is best described as the aggregate of all hostile acts carried out by all individuals, either armed forces, organized armed groups, or civilians, during an armed conflict.\nThe specific acts carried out by civilians qualify as direct participation in hostilities if they meet all of the following criteria:\n Cyber, supra note 57.\n Geneva POW, supra note 34, art. 4; TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 52, at Rule 35.\n Melzer, supra note 90, at Part II.B.\n Id.\n Id.\n Id.\n Id. at Part VI.\n Id.\n Melzer, supra note 90, at Part VI.\n\n1) the act is likely to adversely affect the military operations or capacity of a party to an armed conflict or inflict death, injury, or destruction on persons or objects protected against direct attack, which is the threshold of harm; 2) there must be a direct causal link between the act and harm that is likely to occur from the act; and 3) the act must be specifically designed to directly cause the required threshold of harm in support of a party to the armed conflict. The threshold of harm is based on likely harm and does not require the act to materialize into the expected level of harm. Additionally, the act does not have to be an actual attack against troops or military objects; it also includes acts of sabotage as well as disturbing deployments and communications.\nIn addition to meeting the threshold of harm, the second criterion requires there also be a direct causal link between the act and the harm. For there to be direct causation, there must be a sufficiently close causal relationship between the act and the resulting harm. Specifically, direct causation should be brought about in one causal step. Individual actions that can be viewed as merely supporting one side to an armed conflict or that only build up or maintain the capacity of a party is excluded from the concept of direct participation in hostilities. For example, providing supplies for a party or financing the actions of a party to an armed conflict would bring about a result, but there is not direct causation for the potential harm. Other examples of indirect participation would be scientific research and design, recruitment and the training of personnel, and the production or transportation of weapons or equipment.\nThe third criterion requires there be a belligerent nexus, which is that an act must be specifically designed to directly cause the required threshold of harm in support of a party to the armed conflict. Accordingly, the act must be objectively likely to inflict harm, and it must be specifically designed to do so in\n *Id.* at Part V.\n *Id.*\n *Id.*\n *Id.* at Part V.2.b.\n *Id.* at Part V.2.f.\n Melzer, *supra* note 90, at Part V.\n *Id.* at Part V.2.b.\n *Id.* at Part V.3.\n\n[Vol. XLII]\nsupport of a party to the armed conflict. Therefore, violence that is not designed to harm a party to an armed conflict cannot amount to direct participation in hostilities. This type of violence is left solely to domestic law enforcement measures and not LOAC or IHL. The belligerent nexus requirement is important, because there are many activities during armed conflict that cause a considerable level of harm but fall short of direct participation in hostilities. This is exemplified by violent crimes committed for reasons unrelated to the conflict, such as robberies or murders, as well as the theft of military equipment for private use or sale. Also requiring special attention is use of individual self-defense or defense of others. If a civilian uses force to protect his property from looting, he is not doing so with a belligerent nexus. Instead, he is acting out of self-defense.\nUnderstanding whether hostilities by civilians during armed conflict rise to the level of direct participation is not enough. The defining moment of when the direct participation in hostilities begins and ends is also important. Preparatory measures leading up to the execution of the specific act, and the movement to and from the location of the execution, all constitute integral parts of the act. Accordingly, IHL concerns itself with more than just exactly when the act took place; it looks at the totality of the circumstances surrounding the civilian’s direct participation in hostilities. This is a significant point, because civilians lose their protection against direct attacks for such time as they directly participate in hostilities.\nPreparatory measures are those that IHL would describe as military operations in preparation for an attack and which are so closely linked to the execution of the specific act that they constitute an integral part of the act. Even so, there is no requirement that the preparatory measures occur immediately prior to the specific act or even in close geographic proximity to the\n\nplace of the specific act. An example in the physical domain would be a civilian who builds a bomb in his garage, which he intends to place in the road in order to blow it up and injure armed forces during an international armed conflict. In this illustration, the preparatory measures taken by the civilian bomb maker in his garage, as well as the transit to and from the place where he plants the bomb, would all be considered part of the direct participation in hostilities. Thus, the bomb maker could be targeted at any point from when he starts building the bomb in his garage until he returns home from planting it. Also included in general preparatory measures would be the transporting of personnel, gathering of intelligence, and equipping and instructing armed forces. Where the execution of a hostile act does not require deployment, such as hostilities in cyberspace, the duration of the act should be limited to the immediate execution of the act.\n## B. Tallinn Manual View of Direct Participation in Hostilities\nThe Tallinn Manual’s International Group of Experts generally agrees with the three cumulative criteria for qualification as a direct participation in hostilities as applied to cyberspace. First, there must be a threshold of harm, wherein the civilian has the intended or actual effect of negatively affecting the military operations or capabilities of a party to an armed conflict or inflicting death, physical harm, or material destruction on persons or objects protected against direct attack. Physical damage to objects or harm to individuals is not required, so long as the cyber act negatively affects the party militarily. Second, there must be a direct causal link between the act and the harm intended. An example would be a civilian conducting cyber acts against an armed force in international armed conflict, wherein the civilian disrupts the command and control, even temporarily, for the armed force. Finally, there must be a belligerent nexus established by the\n *Id.*\n *Id.*\n Melzer, *supra* note 90, at Part VI.\n TALLINN MANUAL, *supra* note 52, at Rule 35, comment 4.\n *Id.*\n *Id.*\n *Id.*\n\n[Vol. XLII\nact directly relating to the hostilities.\nIn cyberspace, direct participation in hostilities by civilians may be more difficult to delineate. Determining whether a civilian directly participated in conventional hostilities is complex by itself; making the same determination in cyber-hostilities is especially so. Civilians conducting cyber-attacks related to an armed conflict would qualify as an act of direct participation in hostilities. A cyber-attack is defined as a cyber operation that is reasonably expected to cause injury or death to persons or damage or destruction to objects. Accordingly, civilians conducting cyber-attacks in this way would meet the three criteria for directly participating in hostilities. Other examples of direct participation include civilians conducting cyber operations with the intent to identify vulnerabilities in a targeted computer network or system, or civilians designing malware to take advantage of vulnerabilities in the systems of a party to an armed conflict. Further examples in the cyber domain include civilians using cyber means to gather information on enemy operations and passing that information to the other armed force in the conflict as well as conducting distributed denial of service operations against military systems.\nOn the other hand, not all cyber operations by civilians would rise to the level of direct participation in hostilities. For example, designing malware for a specific purpose and making it available online, even if it is actually used by someone else to conduct an attack during an armed conflict, would not be considered direct participation. What would be lacking would be the threshold of harm in the first criterion; the malware creator never had the intended or actual effect of negatively affecting military operations or capabilities. Another example would be civilians simply maintaining computer equipment generally, even if that equipment were eventually used in hostilities. Again, what would be\n *Id.*\n Emily Crawford, *Virtual Battlegrounds: Direct Participation in Cyber Warfare*, 9 J. L. &amp; POL’Y INFO. SOC’Y 1 (2013).\n TALLINN MANUAL, *supra* note 52, at Rule 35, comment 5.\n *Id.* at Rule 30.\n *Id.* at Rule 35, comment 5.\n *Id.*\n *Id.*\n *Id.*\n\nmissing is the threshold of harm at the first criterion.\nThe first criterion of the threshold of harm would also disqualify other cyber operations taken during an armed conflict. Cyber operations during an armed conflict that are taken for purely criminal or private reasons would not qualify as direct participation in hostilities. As an example, a criminal using cyber means to steal funds from a party to a conflict for purely personal gain, and not to negatively affect the party, would not be directly participating in hostilities. What is difficult about this example is that the party to the armed conflict would have to determine the intent of the civilian actor, which could be disguised as purely personal and criminal when it could in fact be aimed at adversely affecting the party to the conflict. Taken a step further, if the individual stole the money from the party in order to finance particular military operations, the operation to steal the money would be considered a direct participation in hostilities.\nPreparatory measures in cyberspace differ from those taken in the physical domain. Because civilians can be directly targeted for the duration of time during which they are directly participating in hostilities, it is important for parties to an armed conflict to understand the timeframe of direct participation. The actions taken in cyberspace immediately preceding or subsequent to a qualifying act of direct participation are included in the preparatory measures. As an example, a civilian travelling to and from the location of the computer he uses to mount a cyber operation would be included in the preparatory measures, and the civilian could be directly targeted in transit. The time for preparatory measures may even extend as far backward and forward in time as the causal link to the action exists. For example, in a cyber operation this would include the time when the civilian first starts to explore the vulnerabilities of the system of a party to an armed conflict, the time the individual creates the cyber tool to exploit the vulnerabilities, the period of time the civilian attacks the system, and through to the time the individual assesses\n TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 52, at Rule 35, comment 6.\n Id.\n Id.\n Id. at Rule 35, comment 7.\n Id.\n Id.\n\n[Vol. XLII\nthe damage to the system.\nIn addition to the preparatory measures taken for a cyber operation, parties to an armed conflict must take into account the delayed effects of direct participation in hostilities by civilians. The actions taken by civilians in the cyber domain have some parallels to the physical domain, but they also vary widely. The emplacement of a logic bomb, which is designed to activate at some point in the future upon either a command or after a predetermined period of time, is an example. The majority of the Tallinn Manual’s International Group of Experts takes the position that the time frame for which the civilian is directly participating, and can thus be targeted, is from the beginning of his involvement in mission planning until the individual terminates his active role in the operation. It is important to point out that the end of the period of direct participation may not sync up with the point when the damage occurs. For example, the first civilian may have created and emplaced the logic bomb, which is awaiting a command prompt to activate it. A second civilian may be the one to actually command the bomb to activate. In this example, the first civilian could have halted his period of direct participation and would no longer be directly targetable when the damage actually occurs. Thus, the key is for parties to determine when individuals are targetable based on when their participation begins and ends.\n## C. Determination of Direct Participation in Hostilities Complicated by Cyberspace-Specific Issues\nThe delayed effects of cyber operations complicate the accurate determination of precisely when a civilian is directly participating in cyber hostilities. The majority of the International Group of Experts takes the position that a civilian is directly participating in hostilities from the beginning of his involvement through the point in time where the civilian terminates an active role in the operation. The problem with this majority view is that it does not make clear to the participating civilian or to the\n TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 52, at Rule 35, comment 8.\n Id.\n Id.\n Id.\n Id. at Rule 35, comment 6.\n\nState being attacked the window of time during which the civilian may be directly and legally targeted. The civilian may terminate an active role by no longer checking the status of the ongoing cyber operation, but the State may still attribute the operation to the civilian and target him. The State may not discover the ongoing cyber operation until after the civilian has terminated an active role, but the State has no way of knowing the civilian has terminated his active role in the ongoing cyber operation.\nThe logic bomb example parallels civilian operations in the physical world. Coalition Forces fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan faced road-side improvised explosive devices (“IEDs”), which were responsible for causing death and injury to troops as well as damage to military objects. If a civilian was responsible for building, transporting, emplacing, and setting off the IED, the civilian could be targeted throughout the entire process. The beginning and end of the civilian’s direct participation in hostilities could be measured from the time he began sourcing parts for the bomb until the time he set off the IED and transited back from the bombsite. Similarly, the civilian responsible for the logic bomb in the aforementioned example could be targeted from the time he began creating the logic bomb until he commands the logic bomb to activate. However, technology in the cyber domain varies widely from technology in the physical domain.\nIn the cyber domain, individuals can create programs capable of running autonomously or semi-autonomously. A computer network attack (“CAN”) is defined as either a cyber, electronic, or physical attack against an information technology facility or against computer equipment. Most of these CNAs are carried out by cyber operations, which use malicious code to infect enemy computers in order to exploit weaknesses in software, system configuration, or computer security practices. Cyber operations also include the use of bots, or remotely, or semi-autonomously controlled programs infecting computers, as well as botnets, which perform espionage by transmitting data between themselves while\n *Id.* at Rule 35, comment 4 (providing that there is well-known, ongoing debate as to whether the assembly of an IED qualifies as direct participation in hostilities).\n See generally CLAY WILSON, COMPUTER ATTACK AND CYBERTERRORISM 3-11 (2009) (providing insight on different types of attacks against computers).\n *Id.*\n\n[Vol. XLII\nawaiting the final activation signal from the operator. Malicious programs, such as spyware and malware, attack by disrupting normal computer functions or by opening a back door for a remote operator to take control of the computer. Cyber operators have designed computer exploits which launch anonymously from thousands of infected computers and which produce waves of disruption to overwhelm the target of the operation. The technology allowing autonomous and semi-autonomous operations in cyberspace makes difficult the task of determining the beginning and ending points of direct participation by civilians.\nA minority of the Tallinn Manual Group of Experts would break down the various steps in cyber operations such as the emplacement of the logic bomb and its activation as separate acts of direct participation. Under this view, the civilian would only directly participate in hostilities in intermittent instances when he is actively engaged in hostilities. This view provides greater protection to civilians, as they are shielded from directly being targeted except for the times when they are actively engaged in cyber operations. However, this view would make it very difficult for the parties engaged in armed conflict to accurately determine when civilians are directly participating and then target the civilians participating in hostilities at precisely those times. The Group of Experts is split regarding repeated cyber operations. One view is in line with the ICRC in that each cyber act must be treated separately in terms of direct participation analysis. On the other hand, another view is that it would make more operational sense if direct participation begins with the first cyber operation and continues throughout the period of intermittent activity. The latter view removes the “revolving door” effect and simplifies target ability by making the intermittent activity a singular, start-to-finish cyber operation.\n\nThe Tallinn Experts were also divided over the issue of presumption against direct participation. Recall that the Tallinn Manual provides that in cases where there is doubt as to whether an individual is a civilian, that individual should be treated like a civilian. The policy behind this principle is to ensure that civilians are protected to the utmost extent during armed conflicts. Some Tallinn Experts take this same line of thinking regarding civilians believed to be directly participating in hostilities. These experts believe civilians in this predicament should be given the benefit of the doubt.\nHowever, other Tallinn Experts take the position that when there is doubt as to whether a civilian is directly participating in hostilities, the attacking state must review the relevant information available and act reasonably in the circumstances in determining whether to conduct the attack. The policy behind this method rests in the attacking state’s ability to identify which targets are legal targets based on a reasonable review of the available information. The importance of these two views cannot be understated. Some experts side with protecting civilians to the maximum extent possible, while others favor the States’ ability to act while following LOAC principles.\nAlthough the Tallinn Manual agrees with ICRC Guidance’s requirements of a threshold of harm—a causal link between the action and the harm and a belligerent nexus—generally, the Tallinn Manual’s application of the ICRC’s guidance is a variation of the ICRC’s direct participation in hostilities legal regime involving cyber actions. The Tallinn manual does not have a requirement for physical damage to objects, so actions that may not qualify as cyber-attacks may still satisfy the criterion for the threshold of harm if the action has negatively affected the targeted State. Specifically, the Tallinn Manual provides that a civilian’s\n Id. at Rule 35, comment 12.\n TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 52, at Rule 33.\n Id. at Rule 35, comment 12.\n Id.\n Id.\n See Collin Allan, Direct Participation in Hostilities from Cyberspace, 50 VA. J. INT’L L. 174, 178 (2013) (explaining that “an act “must be specifically designed to directly cause the required threshold of harm in support of a party to the conflict and to the detriment of another”).\n Id. at 181 (explaining that “[as] long as an action inflicts, or has the objective\n\n[Vol. XLII]\naction which is carried out with only the intent of negatively affecting the adversary State’s military operations or to inflict death, physical harm, or material destruction on persons or objects is sufficient to show the threshold of harm. Furthermore, the majority of Tallinn experts agreed that interfering with an object’s functionality would rise to the level of destruction if a physical component must be replaced. Thus, the Tallinn view of the first-prong requirement of the threshold of harm may be seen as lowering the standard for what is required for civilians to be directly participating in hostilities.\nThe Tallinn Manual’s view of the second prong, which is the causal link between the act and the harm likely to result, also differs slightly from the ICRC Guidance. In particular, the Tallinn Manual focuses on the intended harm. By focusing on the intended harm, the Tallinn Manual may be lowering the standard of what is required for a civilian to participate in hostilities by looking at the civilian’s intent, rather than focusing on the likelihood of harm from the cyber operation. For example, a civilian may be directly targeted under the Tallinn Manual view for his role in assembling and storing the cyber equivalent of an IED because the individual intends the same harm as the person arming and detonating it. By comparing the Tallinn Manual’s view with the ICRC Guidance, it is possible that the Tallinn Manual lowers the standards for what is required for civilians to be directly participating in cyber hostilities. Therefore, civilians participating in hostilities through cyber means may be targetable in more situations than under the ICRC framework.\n## V.

That is, they are defined as neither members of the armed forces, which includes groups assimilated to the armed forces such as organized armed groups, nor those participating in a levée en masse. Essentially, all others are considered civilians. Private contractors and employees of a party to an armed conflict who fit the definition of civilians are entitled to protection from being directly targeted, unless they are directly participating in hostilities. In addition, private contractors and civilian employees are not entitled to combatant immunity, as they are not members of the armed force. The activities carried out by contractors and employees as well as their location of duty may expose them to an increased risk of death or injury even if they are not directly participating in hostilities.\n## A. State-Affiliated Civilians\nModern warfare is increasingly dependent upon private contractors and civilian employees to fill a variety of positions traditionally held by military personnel. Generally, these private contractors and civilian employees are considered civilians under the same criteria that would apply to other civilians. That is, they cannot be directly targeted by a party to the armed conflict unless and for so long as they directly participate in hostilities. Due to the special roles of private contractors and civilian employees and their proximity to armed forces in hostilities, parties to an armed conflict must make determinations regarding attacks with particular care and due consideration.\nThe majority of private contractors and civilian employees have been incorporated into State armed forces, but they do not\n---\n See generally TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 52, Rule 29 (quoting the Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 Aug. 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts art. 50, § 1, June 8, 1977, 1125 U.N.T.S. 3).\n Melzer, supra note 90.\n Id. at 38.\n Id. at 37.\n Id.\n Id.\n Id.\n\n[Vol. XLII\nperform functions that would have them directly participate in hostilities. Nevertheless, there are some contractor and civilians filling roles that would put them in situations where they could be seen as directly participating in hostilities. For example, private contractors and civilian employees that defend the base from attack could either be directly participating in hostilities or filling a law enforcement and defense-of-others role.\nEven if they have accompanied armed forces, private contractors and civilians were never meant to (and should never be allowed to) directly participate in hostilities on behalf of a party to a conflict. As long as they are not incorporated into armed forces, private contractors and civilian employees do not cease to be civilians, and they do not lose their civilian protection simply because they accompany armed forces. Moreover, they do not lose their civilian protection just because they assume functions other than conducting hostilities, which traditionally would have been performed by members of armed forces. Contractors and civilian employees who directly participate in hostilities without the express authorization of the party to the armed conflict remain civilians, but they lose their protection from being directly targeted. Contractors and employees can lose their civilian status if they have been incorporated into the armed forces of a party to a conflict. If this happens, the contractors and employees would become members of an organized armed force under the command responsible for the party to the conflict and would no longer qualify as civilians.\n---\n See Melzer, *supra* note 90, at 37 (explaining the basic notion of direct participation in hostilities).\n See *id.* at 44 (illustrating that “[t]he notion of direct participation in hostilities does not refer to a person’s status, function, or affiliation, but to his or her engagement in specific hostile acts”).\n *Id.* at 38.\n *Id.*\n *Id.*\n *Id.*\n See Melzer, *supra* note 90, at 39 (explaining that “[a]s long as they are not incorporated into the armed forces, private contractors and civilian employees do not cease to be civilians simply because they accompany the armed forces and or assume functions other than the conduct of hostilities that would traditionally have been performed by military personnel”).\n *Id.*\n\nThe Tallinn Manual’s international group of experts concurs that individual contractors and civilians may only be directly targeted based on their direct participation in hostilities during an armed conflict. However, there are issues that arise in cyberspace regarding the use of contractors and civilians to perform specific military operations. Unlike traditional warfare, where almost all military operations were carried out by troops and equipment, modern warfare introduces the use of cyber capabilities which conduct a portion of the military operations. An example is the hiring of a private company by a party to an armed conflict that is later contracted to perform specific military operations. Based on the military operations, the company would qualify as an organized armed group belonging to the party to the conflict. Therefore, the civilians employed as private contractors would be considered belonging to the organized armed group. However, even if the civilians were not to be considered as belonging to the organized armed group, they would still only be directly targetable when and if they are directly participating in hostilities.\nCivilian government employees are also employed in positions requiring them to conduct cyber operations during an armed conflict, such as positions within an intelligence agency. If the group of civilians conducting cyber operations qualifies as an organized armed group, the civilian members are subject to attack regardless of direct participation in hostilities. Otherwise, the civilian employees are only directly targetable when they are directly participating in hostilities. As a result, the historic view of citizens carrying out actions typically performed by members of armed forces may be problematic when analyzing the cyber domain construct. The traditional view of warfare holds that private contractors and civilian employees operating in an organized armed group, affiliated with armed forces in an armed conflict, would not be entitled to combatant status.\n\n[Vol. XLII]\nFurthermore, a party to the armed conflict employing civilians to perform intelligence functions, attack execution, or other CNA operations would violate the law of war. The reasoning behind this view is that only members of armed forces or assimilated organizations are granted combatant status because they meet the following conditions: (i) they are commanded by a person responsible for his subordinates; (ii) they have a fixed distinctive emblem recognizable at distance; (iii) they carry arms openly; and (iv) they conduct their operation in accordance with the laws and customs of war. Accordingly, under the traditional view, parties to an armed conflict should employ members of the armed force to carry out CNA functions, and if they desire contractors or civilian employees to fill these roles, then the parties should incorporate them into the regular armed forces.\nDue to the vastly different landscape and operations carried out in cyberspace as opposed to the physical domain, a suggested course of action would be to rely less on the aforementioned four conditions and instead look to state affiliation. The four criteria from the 1874 Brussels Declaration apply perfectly to traditional warfare, but operations in cyberspace are conducted without the need of having a fixed recognizable emblem or of carrying arms openly. By requiring state affiliation for civilian employees, it preserves concern for the principle of distinction in CNA from the Brussels criteria. States employing civilians to conduct cyber operations are less likely to be doing so to prevent the enemy from attacking the civilians. Instead, States are likely taking advantage of the economic, training, and recruiting advantages that develop as a result of not being limited to armed forces filling these behind-the-lines roles. The fact that cyber operations take\nON CYBER CONFLICT, 235, 242 (2012), https://ccdcoe.org/cycon/2012/proceedings/d2r1s10_watts.pdf [https://perma.cc/X6F2-TTRP] [hereinafter Notion of Combatancy].\n Id.\n See id. at 245 (citing the Project of an International Declaration Concerning the Laws and Customs of War, Aug. 27, 1874, 4 Martens Nouveau Recueil (ser. 2) 219 (“1874 Brussels Declaration”)).\n Id.\n Id.\n Id.\n See Notion of Combatancy, supra note 210, at 246.\n Id.\n\nplace far from the battlefield also bolsters the position of state affiliation, because there is no concern that the enemy will be confused regarding distinction in targeting.\nUnder the state affiliation view of civilians taking part in cyber operations, discipline in warfare will continue to be preserved as it is under the four Brussels criteria. Currently, civilians directly participating in hostilities are not subject to the internal military disciplinary system. However, the well-developed legal regimes that prosecute and punish war crimes operate in a manner to vindicate concerns for discipline and humanity. In addition to international enforcement bodies, domestic criminal codes now serve as mechanisms where civilians are equally susceptible to prosecution for any war crimes they have committed. Under the state-affiliation view, States will be able to employ civilians to conduct cyber operations while enabling combatant status. States will also be able to maintain the critically important notions of distinction and discipline as provided under the four Brussels criteria.\nStates employing private contractors and civilian employees do so because of the different landscape and types of operations carried out in cyberspace. As they are written and observed, current LOAC principles, ICRC guidance, and the Tallinn Manual hold that civilians operating in cyberspace in a way that directly participates in hostilities are subject to directly being targeted but are not given combatant immunity. The view of letting state-affiliation drive combatant status determinations for cyberspace operations provides civilians with combatant status, or a version of it, while parties to an armed conflict can still conduct warfare and be no worse off. Currently, parties to an armed conflict operating in cyberspace are left with the difficult task of making determinations regarding direct participation in hostilities by civilians operating anonymously. The state-affiliation view would, at the least, put civilians on notice of what their consequences of participation entail, as well as protect them by\n\n[Vol. XLII]\ngiving them some version of combatant immunity for their actions in armed conflict.\nA comparison of state-affiliated actors versus non-state-affiliated actors may lead to different statuses for each. When viewed as either contractors, who are working on behalf of a State engaged in an international armed conflict, or hacktivists, who operate outside of the control of the State but engage in cyber operations in favor of the State, the statuses of each may be seen as divergent. While neither of the two would qualify for combatant immunity, based on the four requirements provided by the Third Geneva Convention, contractors would have the best shot at being entitled prisoner-of-war (“POW”) status. Due to the nature of their service, contractors accompanying an armed force likely carry identification cards associating them with the armed force. Accordingly, contractors would not be given combatant status, but they would be more likely than hacktivists to be given POW status.\nCivilians accompanying armed forces are afforded some protection, but that protection comes with the inherent danger of accompanying armed forces. State-affiliated civilians qualifying for the narrow category of “civilians accompanying the armed forces” could be eligible for POW status while at the same time also be legitimate military targets for the enemy State. These civilians would likely be performing duties in the functional category of operating and maintaining the cyber operations systems. The civilians filling this state-affiliated role would\n See Logan Liles, *The Civilian Cyber Battlefield: Non-State Cyber Operators’ Status Under the Law of Armed Conflict*, 39 N.C. J.

Their role and location make them possible military targets as well as collateral damage for the enemy State attacking the armed force.\nAnother area of civilian participation in the cyber domain, which remains unresolved, is the participation by civilian scientists specializing in cyberspace. The majority of the participation by a state-affiliated civilian cyber scientist would be viewed as indirect participation. However, there are possible situations where a civilian’s particular expertise could have an exceptional and potentially decisive value for the outcome of an armed conflict. An example would be a computer programmer who researches and writes attack programs, one of which is used to incapacitate the enemy’s network controlling the launch of weapons systems. In this example, the civilian scientist could be responsible for the turning point in the conflict, thus shifting his participation from indirect to direct. The importance of this example is that the State hosting the state-affiliated civilian and the civilian need to understand the possible implications of having the scientist participate, directly or indirectly, in hostilities. Further, the enemy State is going to have to make a call as to whether it can directly target the civilian scientist or attack the military target and consider the scientist collateral damage.\n## B. Non-State-Affiliated Civilians\nNon-state-affiliated civilians, also known as patriotic hackers or hacktivists, are the civilians directly participating in hostilities armed forces’ (presumably those who operate and maintain those systems)—even if they do not actually press the button that launches a cyberattack—are both eligible for prisoner-of-war status and also legitimate military targets for the enemy”).\n *Id.*\n *See id.* at 291–92 (stating that “there is a high probability that many, if not most, of the personnel substantively involved in cyber operations may actually be civilians”).\n *See id.* at 292 (discussing that “[c]omputer technicians, technical maintenance personnel and others who perform similar tasks . . . could thus qualify for inclusion in the limited category of ‘persons who accompany the armed forces without actually being members thereof’”).\n *See id.* at 291 (distinguishing computer programmers who research and write attack programs from operators who execute cyber attacks).\n Turns, *supra* note 62, at 291.\n\n[Vol. XLII]\non their own volition, so they will likely receive no protection under LOAC. These hackers carry out cyber operations against perceived enemy computer systems, without the control or oversight from their government but seek common political ends. Hacktivists would seem to receive no protection due to their direct participation in hostilities; however, hacktivists could arguably be considered participants in a *levée en masse* if they took up arms spontaneously upon the enemy approaching, lack organization, and carried arms openly. If so, hacktivists would be entitled to POW status, but they could be directly targeted while directly participating in hostilities. The LOAC principles have not been updated for cyber operations, so it is difficult to play out exactly how non-state-affiliated civilians are to be treated during international armed conflicts. Ideally, IHL would be universally understood by states engaged in armed conflict and the non-state-affiliated civilians who choose to directly participate in cyber hostilities would be on notice as to how their actions will be measured.\nAlso, made difficult by the landscape and types of operations carried out in cyberspace is the direct targeting of those individuals directly participating. Aside from anonymity being a difficult hurdle in cyberspace, the determination as to whether a physical attack is justified in response to a cyber action is still theoretical. Furthermore, neither treaties nor customary international law have established the illegality of espionage, either in the physical world or in cyberspace. Thus, civilians conducting CNAs on behalf of a State which is party to an armed conflict may not be directly participating in hostilities. Further, customary international law has not recognized data manipulation and deletions as rising to the level of hostilities, so civilians conducting these types of CNAs would not be directly participating in hostilities.\n## VI. Suggested Treatment For Non-State-Affiliated Civilians\n *Id.* at 293.\n *See id.* (explaining that hacktivists could arguably be assimilated to the rarely used category of *levée en masse*, in which case they would be entitled to POW status if captured, and could also be subject to attack while acting as such a body; [i]n order to meet the legal conditions of a *levée en masse* they would have to “take up arms” spontaneously “on the approach of the enemy”).\n *See id.* (explaining the difficulty of applying the criteria necessary to meet the legal conditions of a *levée en masse* in a cyber-conflict).\n\n# Directly Participating In Cyber Hostilities\nThe principles of LOAC, as they currently exist, govern actions taken in cyberspace as if they occur in the more traditional, physical domain. A major concern with this LOAC application is the effect it has on civilians. As the law of war has evolved, the protection of civilians has been one of the key tenets from the outset. The Fourth Geneva Convention sought to protect civilian persons taking no part in hostilities as well as the wounded and sick. The Convention also prohibited an occupying power from destroying real and personal property belonging to civilians. The Additional Protocol I of the Geneva Convention calls for the protection of civilians from unnecessary injury or death and obliges combatants to distinguish themselves from the civilian population while engaged in an attack. The civilian population is specifically protected under Part IV, which demands the parties to at all times distinguish between civilian population and combatants as well as between civilian objects and military objectives. Further, Protocol I prohibits parties from making the civilian population the object of an attack, which also prohibits acts or threats having the intent to terrorize the civilian population.\nThe protections provided by LOAC are two-fold. On one hand, they are meant to inform parties to an armed conflict regarding how to conduct themselves while at war. On the other hand, LOAC provides notice to civilians affected by armed conflict as to the treatment they can expect from the parties to the conflict. The relative nuance of cyberspace operations, as compared to traditional warfare, makes difficult the determination of direct participation in hostilities by citizens. If LOAC principles are incapable of adequately putting parties to armed conflict and citizens on notice, it should be amended for this purpose.\n Geneva Convention, supra note 2, art. 15.\n Id.\n Id. art. 44.\n Protocol I, supra note 1, art. 48.\n Id. art. 51.\n\n[Vol. XLII\n## A. Temporal Considerations in the Cyber Domain\nDirect participation in hostilities by civilians operating in the cyber domain is vastly different than participation in the physical domain due to temporal considerations. Actions taken in cyberspace are not easily detected as they are happening, and they are often created for use in the future. For example, computer network attacks involve the use of malicious code to either infect an enemy’s computer system or to exploit weaknesses in the software, system configuration, or security practices. Additionally, bots and even botnets are remotely-controlled or semi-autonomous computer programs that infect computers and systems to transmit data obtained by the system or instruct the system to operate a certain way. Hackers have even designed ways to exploit computers and systems in a way to launch programs anonymously and autonomously from thousands of infected computers. Accordingly, cyber operations differ greatly from physical operations due to the timing of how the operations are carried out. Cyber operations can be set to take place at a certain time in the future or after a certain event has occurred.\nThe ICRC Guidance and the Tallinn Manual both touch on these temporal considerations. The ICRC provides that preparatory acts can be treated as separate acts and distinguished from the act that is the object of the direct participation in hostilities. Therefore, a civilian participating in hostilities may\n See WILSON, supra note 163, at 39 (explaining the characteristics of malicious code).\n Id. at 38 (explaining that “[a]utomated programs, or ‘bots’ . . . are increasingly autonomous, rapid, and difficult to detect . . . [and] can be remotely controlled by commands sent through the Internet and can be activated to operate in a coordinated manner on thousands of computers in different locations around the world”); see id. at 41 (explaining that “[s]ome compromised computers become part of an automatic ‘bot network,’ quietly performing espionage by transmitting data or intermediate preparatory instructions back and forth between compromised computers while awaiting a special final activation signal originating from the attacker”).\n See id. at 43 (explaining that “hackers have also designed recent computer exploits that launch anonymously from thousands of infected computers to produce waves of disruption that can quickly overwhelm a targeted organization, or multiple organizations such as a list of banking institutions”).\n See Melzer, supra note 90, at 68 (stating that “[w]here the execution of a hostile act does not require geographic displacement, as may be the case with computer network attacks or remote-controlled weapons systems, the duration of direct participation in\n\nconduct a series of acts, each directly participating in hostilities, over a period of time that lead up to the object of the direct participation. The Tallinn Manual provides that the scope of direct participation includes the actions immediately preceding and those subsequent to the qualifying act of direct participation in hostilities. The majority of the Tallinn Experts agree that a civilian is directly targetable only for the duration of the direct participation in hostilities, regardless of when the actual effects are realized. Yet, some of the experts take the position that the time period during which a civilian can be directly targeted extends for as long as there is a causal link to the intended harm. That is, a civilian is targetable as far upstream and as far downstream as that civilian’s causal link exists between the action taken and the intended harm. As an example, a civilian may be targeted as early as when he begins a cyber operation by probing the enemy’s system and carry through to when he conducts the cyber operation against the system. The civilian may even be targeted after the cyber operation, when he is conducting a damage assessment and determining whether to conduct another operation against the system.\nThese temporal considerations are worth exploring because they mostly exist only in the cyber context. Accordingly, there may be a disconnect between how States view cyber operations versus operations in the physical world due to the way LOAC principles were developed for the physical world. Though it is possible to parallel these temporal considerations by discussing IEDs emplaced for the destruction of the enemy State’s equipment and the injury of its people, there is not a precise match. While IEDs can be emplaced with the intent of them going off in the future upon being activated, IEDs with this setup cannot be controlled and changed like their logic bomb counterpart in the cyber world. Applying LOAC principles to an IED would yield\n TALLINN MANUAL, *supra* note 52, at Rule 35, comment 7.\n *Id.* at Rule 35, comment 8.\n *Id.* at Rule 35, comment 7.\n *Id.*\n *Id.*\n *Id.*\n\n[Vol. XLII\nthe bomb maker likely being targetable while building the bomb, based on his intent, and the civilian emplacing the IED being targetable while emplacing the IED. It would not be as clean cut in the cyber world based on the ability of the logic bomb builder and the one who activates it to carry out the entire operation in complete anonymity as well as being able to control the logic bomb once it is emplaced.\nFor the sake of clarifying the discussion below, the civilians being discussed are non-state-affiliated civilians. State-affiliated civilians are those who operate as either private contractors on behalf of the State or as civilian employees, who are employed by the State. These civilians are better aware of their exposure to direct attack based on the nature of their service, which could include operational as well as geographic proximity to armed forces. Thus, the State and the state-affiliated civilians are on notice as to whether and for how long the civilians may be directly targeted by the opposing state during an armed conflict.\nAdditional Protocol I provides that civilians and civilian populations enjoy general protection against dangers arising from military operations. However, civilians forfeit this protection if and for so long as they directly participate in hostilities. Direct participation by civilians in cyberspace is not always clear. The International Group of Experts was split regarding repeated cyber operations by civilians that qualified as direct participation in hostilities. Some of the experts side with ICRC guidance, which provides that each act must be treated separately as separate acts of direct participation. Other experts conclude separate direct participation analysis made little operational sense and believe it would create a “revolving door” effect regarding targetability. This group of experts believes direct participation by the civilian begins with the first cyber operation he participates in and continues throughout the period of intermittent activity. This incongruent application of existing LOAC principles on cyberspace operations demonstrates the potential for civilians and\n Protocol I, supra note 1, art. 51.\n Id.\n TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 52, Rule 35, comment 7.\n Id.\n Id.\n Id.\n\nparties to an armed conflict to misapply or misinterpret LOAC principles.\nWhat if a non-state-affiliated civilian were to create an autonomous logic bomb and release it with the intent to infiltrate and attack the computer network of the defense ministry of a State which is party to an ongoing armed conflict? At what point could the civilian be targeted by the State? If the State discovers the logic bomb months after it was released by the civilian, and assuming the State can attribute it to the civilian, can the State target the civilian then? Under ICRC guidance, the civilian could be directly targeted for each act of direct participation in hostilities. Accordingly, the civilian could be directly attacked when producing the logic bomb with the intent to launch a CNA against the State, if done so in support of another party to the conflict, and when the civilian actually launches the logic bomb. However, ICRC guidance would not likely support a direct attack against the civilian if discovered months after it was launched. Under the Tallinn Manual’s viewpoint, the civilian may be directly targeted.\nAs discussed above, it may be unclear to civilians directly participating in hostilities in the cyber domain as to how their actions could be interpreted by parties to an armed conflict. Aside from civilians conducting intermittent direct participation in hostilities in cyberspace, civilians may also be unclear as to their exposure for direct targeting due to the uncertain application of LOAC principles to the cyber domain. Specifically, civilians launching autonomous or semi-autonomous programs to attack computer networks may directly participate in hostilities by building the code and program for the specific purpose as well as directly participate by launching the CNA. However, these civilians may at some point decide they no longer wish to pursue the action against a party to an armed conflict.\n JEAN-MARIE HENCKAERTS &amp; LOUISE DOSWALD-BECK, CUSTOMARY INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW VOL. 1: RULES 1, 21 (2005).\n Id.\n Id. at 23.\n Turns, supra note 62, at 281.\n\n[Vol. XLII\n## B. Change of Heart for Civilians Directly Participating in Cyber Hostilities\nHow might a civilian make clear to a State embroiled in an armed conflict that the civilian who conducted a cyber operation against the State no longer wishes to directly participate in cyber hostilities? In the physical domain, the civilian would simply stop shooting at the party, collecting arms to use against the party, building bombs to emplace in roadways, or collecting money to finance attacks against the party to the conflict. An example which could parallel the cyber domain would be a civilian bomb maker who makes a bomb and emplaces that bomb in a road in an effort to target a party to an armed conflict. However, the bomb maker could make clear his intentions to no longer directly participate by putting up a sign warning of the bomb, digging up the bomb, or telling the party the location of the bomb. In cyberspace, a civilian who creates the malicious code for the CNA and launches it may not be able to recall the code or stop the cyber operation once it has begun. Once the malicious code is discovered, the targeted State may attack the civilian because it is impossible to precisely determine if the civilian has stopped directly participating in cyber hostilities. The State could argue the civilian is still monitoring and directing the logic bomb or malicious code.\nThe advanced technology which enables civilians to directly participate in hostilities could make it difficult for both the civilian and the party to the armed conflict to know when the civilian is no longer directly participating. The civilian who produces the malicious code for a CNA concludes his direct participation when he stops working on or even finishes the code. Would the civilian who launches the malicious code for a CNA conclude his direct participation when the code is launched? What if the malicious code were autonomous or semi-autonomous, and it would continue to operate without the aid from the civilian? This would seem to be a magic bullet fired in the physical world. In the physical domain, the bullet would lose speed and fall to the earth. However, malicious code launched in the cyber domain may\n *Id.*\n *Id.*\n *Id.*\n\ncontinue until it is discovered and counter by the attacked party or until it reaches its termination stage, if it has one. May the civilian launching this code be directly targeted until the malicious code ceases to operate as part of the CNA?\nCurrent interpretations by the ICRC and the International Group of Experts contributing to the Tallinn Manual apply IHL to the cyber domain and determine that the civilian launching the CNA code can only be targeted so long as he is directly participating in hostilities, which is when he is actively engaged. The ICRC and the Group of Experts are unwilling to extend the window of targetability to include ongoing hostilities set in motion by the individual unleashing the malicious code aimed at conducting a CNA. As previously stated in the magic bullet analogy, there is nothing to stop the CNA code except for the initiator, unless the attacked State becomes aware of the CNA and takes steps to defend against it. Accordingly, should not the attacked State be able to target the civilian initiator after he has set in motion the CNA? If the State is able to stretch the targetability window to legally target the initiating civilian so long as the CNA is underway, can the civilian limit his exposure in any way?\nA solution might be found in the American Law Institute’s Model Penal Code (“MPC”). The MPC defines criminal conspiracy as a person conspiring with another person or group of persons to commit a crime if the individual, with the purpose of promoting or facilitating the crime: 1) agrees with the other person or group that one or more of them will engage in conduct constituting a crime; or 2) agrees to aid the other person or group in planning or committing the crime. However, the actor may, after having conspired to commit a crime, use as an affirmative defense the fact that the actor thwarted the success of the conspiracy after having manifested a complete and voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose. By renouncing his support for the crime and thwarting the success of the conspiracy, the actor is able to undo the effort he put into conspiring to commit the crime.\n Eva Knopova, *New IHL Framework for Cyber Warfare: Master’s Thesis*, CHARLES UNIV. PRAGUE DEP’T INT’L L. 47 (2016).\n Id.\n American Law Institute, *MODEL PENAL CODE § 5.03* (Tent. Draft No. 4, 1955).\n Id.\n\n[Vol. XLII]\nAs applied to the above issue regarding civilians directly participating in cyber hostilities, a civilian putting into place malicious code capable of autonomously conducting a CNA may be able to be certain he cannot be directly targeted by the party to an armed conflict by renouncing his support for the cyber hostilities and working to thwart further cyber hostilities by the code. By attempting to prevent future direct targeting, the civilian may inadvertently leave himself exposed to attack by making his actions and identity known to the party. However, a party to an armed conflict abiding by LOAC would not be able to target a civilian who is no longer participating in hostilities. Further, the civilian may take similar actions to renounce his participation and thwart further action by the code in an anonymous way.\nBy adopting this view, States who are a party to an armed conflict have better ground rules as to how to legally target non-state-affiliated civilians who are participating in cyber hostilities in a way that may not be covered by current IHL. Additionally, under this view, civilians will have a better understanding of how their actions, carried out as cyber operations, will be treated by States who are a party to an armed conflict. This view provides States and civilians with notice of how actions by civilians will be treated in cyberspace. Further, this view provides civilians who have participated in cyber hostilities, and who may be determined to be still participating based on the autonomous CNA code the individual initiated, an opportunity to remove themselves from hostilities. By taking steps discussed in the MPC to remove oneself from a conspiracy, the initiating individual can undo the bonds currently opening himself up to being targeted by a party to the conflict.\nBy coming forward, renouncing his support for the ongoing cyber hostilities, and attempting to thwart the object of the cyber\n HENCKAERTS &amp; DOSWALD-BECK, supra note 260, at 19–20.\n See generally INT’L &amp; OPERATIONAL L. DEP’T., THE JUDGE ADVOCATE GEN.’S LEGAL CTR. &amp; SCH., U.S. ARMY, LAW OF ARMED CONFLICT DESKBOOK, 7 (2015) (explaining that “[o]nly combatants or those directly participating in hostilities may be targeted . . . [n]on-combatants, including civilians and persons out of combat, may not intentionally be targeted”).\n HENCKAERTS &amp; DOSWALD-BECK, supra note 260, at 19–20.\n American Law Institute, supra note 269.\n\noperation, a civilian may prevent the targeted State from directly targeting the civilian. However, the civilian may also be creating an unexpected repercussion. The civilian directly taking part in cyber hostilities, favoring a party to an armed conflict by conducting cyber operations against an opponent party, also exposes himself to domestic criminal law pertaining to the cyber operations. By coming forward, the civilian may be opening himself up to prosecution under domestic criminal law in an effort to prevent being directly targeted by the State against whom the civilian directly participated in hostilities. This may create a disincentive for civilians to expose themselves as ongoing direct participants in cyber hostilities, but the damage is already done.\nThe only question that remains is attribution. Can the attacked State determine who the civilian is for either direct targeting purposes or domestic criminal prosecution? If the civilian believes so, the civilian could limit his exposure to being directly attacked as well as request leniency from the domestic criminal prosecution for his cooperation. The alternative is for the civilian to figure out a way to completely remove every trace of his participation in an ongoing cyber operation, thereby ensuring the attacked State does not discover the cyber operation, attribute it to the civilian, and directly attack him.\nWithout this possible outlet, civilians who have had a change of heart and no longer wish to participate in cyber hostilities may be targeted in the future for previous participation in cyber hostilities, of which they no longer wish to be a part. Though not a perfect method for keeping civilians safe from being directly targeted, this method provides notice to the attacking State of the civilian’s previous acts, which are the acts the civilian no longer wishes to be held accountable for in the realm of armed conflict. The civilian’s renouncing of previous participation in hostilities will not absolve him of domestic law implications, but it will ensure he is not targeted in the future.\n\n[Vol. XLII]\n# VII. Conclusion\nCivilians directly participate in hostilities for numerous reasons. State-affiliated civilians might engage in direct participation as part of their job; non-state-affiliated civilians might directly participate out of a sense of patriotism, helping the underdog, or feeling like part of the fight. Cyberspace creates an environment unlike any other ever seen before, so civilians and States who are a party to an armed conflict struggle to understand how LOAC principles apply to their conduct. A misunderstanding by a civilian could lead to a prolonged period of being directly targeted by a party to a conflict; a misunderstanding by that party could lead to allegations of war crimes. All sides to a conflict, to include civilians, would benefit from consensus in the application of LOAC to the cyber domain.\nA consensus in the application of LOAC principles in the cyber domain could lead to stronger footing for States and citizens as the cyberspace domain becomes a larger battleground. Cyberspace issues such as anonymity, attribution, temporal considerations, and equal application of force between the physical and cyber domains all highlight the need to better define LOAC applications to the cyber domain. Specifically, civilians should be able to renounce their direct participation in cyber hostilities, and they should no longer face direct targeting by a party to a conflict for cyber operations taken previously. The Tallinn Manual spells out that civilians may be directly targeted so long as their causal link to the action exists. States subscribing to this view may link civilians to cyber operations carried out previously, even after civilians have walked away and no longer desire to directly participate.\nThe ability to target civilians for previous acts of cyber hostilities when States believe a causal link still exists may lead to an expanded window of time during which a civilian may be targeted. Thus, States who are party to a conflict should be able to know with certainty that the civilian they intend to target is a lawful target, due to the civilian’s ongoing intent to directly participate in hostilities. The renunciation clause found in the Model Penal Code could be the solution to ending\n Turns, supra note 62, at 281.\n Id.\n\nmisunderstandings by civilians and parties to a conflict regarding direct participation and targeting.\nUnder this view, civilians have a way to guarantee they will no longer be directly targeted for past cyber operations amounting to direct participation in hostilities when the State may not know the civilian’s participation has concluded. In addition, this view provides an out for States directly targeting civilians for directly participating in cyber hostilities against the State because the civilian has the opportunity and incentive to come clean if the civilian no longer wishes to directly participate. By coming forward, civilians may open themselves up to domestic prosecution, but they guarantee they will not be directly targeted by a State.\nA final point is examined by asking: should civilians have to go to such lengths to ensure they will not be directly targeted by a State for previous instances of direct participation in hostilities? Further, should LOAC require citizens to take active steps to put States on notice as to the citizens’ activities to prevent being illegally targeted after the direct participation in hostilities has concluded? An argument can be made that this policy would be requiring too much of civilians, and it exposes civilians to a lose-lose scenario.\nOn the one hand, civilians want to ensure the temporal anomalies in the cyber domain do not mislead States into falsely believing civilians are continuing to directly participate in hostilities after participation has ended. On the other, civilians want to protect against domestic prosecution and initiating an investigation into their activities. Though a possible solution to the issue of civilians being overly or illegally targeted could be found in the Model Penal Code, international law may not be willing to support the process or potential side effects to civilians providing notice to States that the civilians have withdrawn from the direct participation in hostilities.\n\n^{}[]",

The Treatment of Civilians in Traditional Warfare Whether it is their own loss of life or injury, the loss or injury of a relative, or the collateral damage of their property, civilians always suffer during war. Accordingly, major nation states have been working together for over a century to address the way traditional wars are fought, and they have sought to add a sense of humanity and require discrimination in targeting. In 1949, major nation states acceded to the Fourth Geneva Convention, which was called “The Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War” and sought to protect noncombatants.² Prior to the Geneva Conventions, civilians were left to the mercy of the combatants and their beliefs as to sparing civilians.³ The Geneva Conventions codified what had been inching closer to customary law for decades.⁴ The movement in this direction can be seen by the Lieber Code, which sought to regulate war; and later the Declaration of St. Petersburg in 1868, which prohibited the use of specific weapons for humanitarian reasons.⁵ The ² Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, Aug. 12, 1949, 110 Stat. 2104, 75 U.N.T.S. 287 [hereinafter Geneva Convention]."

Tucker Jr., USAF [B.A., Valdosta State University (2002); M.B.A., [Vol. XLII # I. Introduction The Law of Armed Conflict (“LOAC”) has evolved over the past century and a half to protect civilians from the harms caused by war as well as to put all parties on notice as to their expected conduct. Civilians, like any other group, are not prohibited from directly participating in hostilities, but they lose their protection from being directly targeted for such time as they chose to do so.¹ This protection for civilians is easier understood as it is applied to the physical domain, for which it was created. The cyber domain is vastly different. Accordingly, civilians and States who are party to international armed conflicts are left to apply their own understanding of how LOAC principles should be applied to the cyber domain.\nThe difference of interpretation by civilians and parties to armed conflict could leave civilians overly exposed to direct attack and parties accountable for war crimes. This is especially true for non-state-affiliated civilians conducting cyber hostilities against a State that is party to an armed conflict. The differentiation between state-affiliated and non-state-affiliated civilians matters, because state-affiliated civilians should understand they may be injured or killed based on their work alongside and their proximity to armed forces. Thus, they are likely on notice that they may be directly targeted if directly participating in hostilities as well as considered collateral damage during a legal attack by an enemy State. In addition, civilians may open themselves up to an extended period of time during which they may be directly targeted based on the type of cyber operation they conduct.\nVarying views support the notion that civilians intermittently participating directly in hostilities may be targeted throughout a linked-together period of participation. Further, if a civilian were to launch against a State a cyber operation that activates at a set point in the future or after a forecasted event, the State could possibly treat the civilian as directly participating in hostilities long after the civilian actually initiated and participated in the cyber operation. This delayed direct targeting of the civilian can happen either because the State is unaware of exactly when the cyber operation was launched against it or because it interprets its ¹ Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts, June 8, 1977, 110 Stat. 2104, 1125 U.N.T.S. 51 [hereinafter Protocol I].\nresponse as warranted under LOAC.\nAlong with opening themselves up to being directly targeted, civilians participating in cyber hostilities may also face domestic criminal law exposure for their cyber hostilities. States that are party to an armed conflict could seek to lawfully target the civilian rather than await a domestic law prosecution. A possible solution to civilians being overly exposed to direct attack for their decision to directly participate in cyber hostilities could come from the Model Penal Code’s view of renouncing one’s role and thwarting the overall success of the act. Under this theory, a civilian could make the enemy State aware of the civilian’s plot to conduct an ongoing cyber operation against the State in an effort to absolve the civilian of being targeted in the future. However, these civilians may still face domestic criminal law repercussions for doing so.",
    "## II. The Treatment of Civilians in Traditional Warfare Whether it is their own loss of life or injury, the loss or injury of a relative, or the collateral damage of their property, civilians always suffer during war. Accordingly, major nation states have been working together for over a century to address the way traditional wars are fought, and they have sought to add a sense of humanity and require discrimination in targeting. In 1949, major nation states acceded to the Fourth Geneva Convention, which was called “The Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War” and sought to protect noncombatants.² Prior to the Geneva Conventions, civilians were left to the mercy of the combatants and their beliefs as to sparing civilians.³ The Geneva Conventions codified what had been inching closer to customary law for decades.⁴ The movement in this direction can be seen by the Lieber Code, which sought to regulate war; and later the Declaration of St. Petersburg in 1868, which prohibited the use of specific weapons for humanitarian reasons.⁵ The ² Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, Aug. 12, 1949, 110 Stat. 2104, 75 U.N.T.S. 287 [hereinafter Geneva Convention].": "³ See ANICÉE VAN ENGELAND, CIVILIAN OR COMBATANT?: A CHALLENGE FOR THE 21ST CENTURY ix-xix (2011).\n⁴ Id.\n⁵ Id. at 13–14.\n[Vol. XLII] international agreement formed at the 1874 Brussels Convention discussed laws and customs of war and provided that combatant forces are not granted unlimited power as to how to injure the enemy.⁶ This provision was later codified in the Hague Regulations of 1907, as was the general understanding of the need for discrimination between civilians and combatants.⁷ Additionally, the Hague Peace Conferences of 1899 and 1907 became the first internationally codified documents providing that civilians should not suffer from the effects of hostilities.⁸ ## A. Geneva Convention and the Additional Protocol The Fourth Geneva Convention, which occurred in 1949, specifically sought to protect civilians during times of war.⁹ Under the Fourth Geneva Convention, persons taking no active part in the hostilities are to be treated humanely and without regard to their faith, sex, race, or religion.¹⁰ In addition, parties to the conflict are to establish neutral zones in regions of combat to shelter wounded and sick combatants and civilians taking no part in hostilities from the effects of war.¹¹ The wounded and the sick are specifically protected and should be provided particular care and respect.¹² In addition to the Fourth Geneva Convention, the Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (“Additional Protocol I”) is a 1977 amendment to the Geneva Convention that focuses on the protection of victims of international armed conflicts.¹³ Protocol I calls for the protection and care of the wounded, sick, and shipwrecked regardless of whether they are military or civilians.¹⁴ To protect civilians from unnecessary injury or death, Protocol I obliges combatants to distinguish themselves from the civilian population while engaged ⁶ *Id.* ⁷ *Id.* ⁸ *Id.* ⁹ See Geneva Convention, *supra* note 2.\n¹⁰ *Id.* art. 3.\n¹¹ *Id.* art. 14.\n¹² *Id.* ¹³ Protocol I, *supra* note 1, art. 3.\n¹⁴ *Id.* in an attack.¹⁵ The civilian population is specifically protected under Part IV, which demands the parties to distinguish at all times between civilian populations and combatants; as well as between civilian objects and military objectives.¹⁶ Further, Protocol I provides that if there is doubt as to whether a person is a civilian, that person should be treated as a civilian.¹⁷ In addition, parties are prohibited from making the civilian population the object of an attack, or making acts or threats intended to terrorize the civilian population.¹⁸ Protocol I also protects civilians by prohibiting indiscriminate attacks such as those not directed at a specific military objective as well as the use of combat means that cannot be sufficiently limited.¹⁹ However, there are limits because the presence or movement of civilians will not render certain areas immune from military operations.²⁰ For example, if a party to the conflict uses a movement of civilians to shield military objects, that party would be in violation of the Protocol. The purpose of the Additional Protocol is to protect civilians during armed conflicts, so a State using civilians as shields will be held accountable for the LOAC violation. In addition, the Hague Convention states that the right of belligerents to adopt means of injuring the enemy is not unlimited.²¹ By limiting the means used against the enemy, civilians are also protected from unnecessary suffering due to the type of weapons used in warfare.²² The purpose of the Hague Convention was to infuse humanity into armed conflicts.²³ By forcing States to use approved weapons, which take into account human suffering, civilians are indirectly protected from inhumane weaponry.\nProtocol I requires precautionary measures to be taken during [Vol. XLII attack planning to limit the injury and death of civilians, as well as damage to civilian objects.²⁴ Specifically, Article 57 instructs parties to take constant care in military operations to spare civilians and civilian objects by requiring parties to verify objectives to be attacked and to take all feasible precautions to avoid and minimize incidental loss of civilian life or injury.²⁵ The parties must also refrain from launching any attack that may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, civilian injury, or loss of civilian property.²⁶ Further, parties are required to cancel or suspend attacks if it becomes clear the objective is not a military one or that the attack will cause loss of civilian life or property or will cause civilian injuries.²⁷ Protocol I also requires parties, to the maximum extent feasible, remove civilians and civilian objects from the vicinity of military objects.²⁸ In addition, parties are to avoid locating military objects within or near densely populated areas.²⁹ The purpose of these measures are to ensure States are being mindful of civilians and civilian property from the beginning of attack planning all the way through the attacks themselves.³⁰ ## B. Civilians Directly Participating in Hostilities Protocol I protects civilians when viewed as innocent bystanders, but what if civilians participate in hostilities? Under the Protocol, parties to an international armed conflict may only target civilians for such time as the civilians take a direct part in hostilities.³¹ At that point, the civilians lose their civilian status protection and can then be targeted by combatants as legally permissible. The timeframe for which civilians can be targeted while directly participating in hostilities is defined by Protocol I as the time during which they are participating.³² However, it is important to keep in mind that the right of the noncombatant population to protection involves a corresponding duty to abstain from hostilities.³³ As an example, if a civilian who is caught in the middle of an international armed conflict decides to pick up a rifle and shoot at a Party to the conflict, the Party’s armed force may target the civilian so long as the civilian poses a threat. If the civilian were to drop the rifle and run back to his house, he could no longer be targeted by the armed force. The targeting of civilians while directly participating in hostilities is rooted in LOAC; any potential domestic law violations would be determined by the civilian’s State. Civilians directly participating in hostilities may face repercussions based on their actions that violate domestic criminal laws as well as being targeted by the enemy State. The Third Geneva Convention also addresses civilians participating in hostilities.\nThe Third Geneva Convention (“Convention”) was adopted in 1949, and its purpose was the protection of the victims of war, both civilian and prisoner.³⁴ This Convention mainly addresses the treatment of prisoners of war, but it also recognizes civilian participation in hostilities.³⁵ Under this Convention, *levée en masse* is the spontaneous taking up of arms by civilian inhabitants of a non-occupied territory when the invading enemy approaches.³⁶ In this case, the civilians would be allowed prisoner-of-war status because they participated in hostilities spontaneously, without the time to form themselves into regular armed units; but they must carry arms openly and respect the laws of war.³⁷ Aside from prisoner of war status, LOAC also addresses combatant immunity and targetability.³⁸ Combatant immunity is addressed in Protocol I, wherein it states that members of a Party’s armed force are combatants, and ³³ Karma Nabulsi, *Evolving Conceptions of Civilians and Belligerents: One Hundred Years After the Hague Peace Conferences, in CIVILIANS IN WAR 9, 16* (Simon Chesterman ed., 2001) (quoting Henry Richmond Droop, *On the Relations Between an Invading Army and the Inhabitants, and the Conditions Under Which Irregular Troops Are Entitled to the Same Treatment as Regular Soldiers*, TRANSACTIONS OF THE GROTIUS SOCIETY 713 (1871)).\n³⁴ Geneva Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War art. 4, Aug. 12, 1949, 6 U.S.T. 3316, 75 U.N.T.S. 135 [hereinafter Geneva POW].\n³⁵ *Id.* ³⁶ *Id.* ³⁷ *Id.* ³⁸ See Protocol I, supra note 1.\n[Vol. XLII] they have the right to participate directly in hostilities.³⁹ The term “combatant” excludes medical personnel, chaplains, and civilians.⁴⁰ Accordingly, in international armed conflict, combatants enjoy immunity regarding their acts as part of hostilities, but it does not prohibit others from engaging in those types of hostilities. Although non-combatants are not specifically prohibited from engaging in hostilities during an armed conflict, they may be directly targeted by the enemy and may face domestic criminal charges for their actions. Therefore, civilians engaging in hostilities would not be entitled to the combatant immunity that is given to combatants participating in an international armed conflict. Thus, civilians would only be entitled to prisoner of war status in limited cases, and they would not be entitled to combatant immunity.\nRegarding targetability, civilians are not to be targeted by the parties to an armed conflict, and civilians are to be generally protected against the dangers arising from military operations.⁴¹ However, LOAC allows civilians to be targeted by an armed force if and for so long as the civilian is directly participating in hostilities.⁴² Therefore, civilians enjoy the freedom from targetability so long as they are not taking a direct part in the hostilities. This freedom from direct targetability extends to a point under LOAC. A State choosing to target a legal military objective must determine if civilians and their property may be damaged by the attack.⁴³ If so, the State must conduct a balancing test to ensure the necessity of taking out the military objective outweighs the possible damage that could be caused to civilians and their property.⁴⁴ In summation, civilians do not have combatant immunity, they may be granted prisoner of war status during a levée en masse, and they cannot be directly targeted unless they are directly participating in hostilities.⁴⁵ Even with the existence of International Humanitarian Law (“IHL”) seeking to protect civilians during times of war, civilians still experience loss. IHL exists with the purpose of protecting civilians during an ongoing armed conflict, but civilians can still be legally killed or injured.⁴⁶ If done according to the Geneva Conventions’ rules of discrimination and proportionality, nations may still strike enemy targets that lead to the loss of limbs, lives, and loved ones for civilians.⁴⁷ As examples, fighter jets can strike a weapons cache next to an apartment complex, a convoy can speed through a school playground,⁴⁸ and combatants can return fire in a crowded street. Aside from a country’s stance on ethics in times of war, the plight of civilians has practical drawbacks, such as the hatred survivors have toward foreign governments and protests following civilian casualties.⁴⁹ The United States military came to understand that it is important to win the hearts and minds of the civilian population in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.⁵⁰ Based on the implications that the United States was callously indifferent regarding civilian casualties, it started tracking the damage it caused and responded directly to affected families.⁵¹ The efforts by the U.S. government to recognize the importance of paying respect to the families of injured or killed civilians is another step toward protecting civilians during times of war.\nInternational Humanitarian Law provides the basis for the protection of civilians during an ongoing armed conflict, but does that translate from the physical world to the cyber world? The cyberspace domain offers capabilities that are far different from the physical domain. Cyberspace provides the cloak of anonymity that may shield civilians and even States from being identified as the responsible party for cyber operations. The protections afforded to civilians have been roughly translated from the physical to the cyber domain by the Tallinn Manual’s International Group of Experts as well as Guidance by the International Committee of the Red Cross.\n### III. The Current Treatment of Civilians in the Cyberspace ⁴⁶ *Id.* ⁴⁷ Sarah Holewinski, *Do Less Harm: Protecting and Compensating Civilians in War*, FOREIGN AFF., Jan.–Feb. 2013, at 14.\n⁴⁸ *Id.* ⁴⁹ *Id.* ⁵⁰ *Id.* ⁵¹ *Id.* [Vol. XLII ## Domain Civilians enjoy very much the same protections in the cyberspace domain as they do in the physical domain. The Tallinn Manual states that civilians are defined in the cyberspace domain as they are under the Additional Protocol I of the Geneva Convention.⁵² Specifically, civilians are defined in terms of neither being members of armed forces nor members of a *levée en masse*.⁵³ As such, individual civilians, as well as civilian populations, shall not be the object of a cyber-attack by a party to the armed conflict.⁵⁴ A cyber-attack is any cyber operation or activity that is reasonably expected to cause injury or death to a person or the damage or destruction to objects.⁵⁵ In addition, LOAC applies to the targeting of people or objects during an armed conflict regardless of the means or methods of warfare that are used.⁵⁶ These seemingly broad definitions are key to protecting civilians during armed conflicts because parties to the conflict are held accountable for actions taken which are incompatible with the law of war.",
    "## A. Cyber Operations and the Law of Armed Conflict Defining cyber warfare, as a whole, is better understood by looking at its component parts. Cyberspace, in general, is the domain within the information environment made up of the interdependent network of information technology infrastructures and the resident data.⁵⁷ Cyber warfare can be viewed as a combined concept of cyberspace operations, offensive cyberspace operations, and defensive cyberspace operations.⁵⁸ Cyber operations are the employment of cyberspace capabilities where the primary purpose is to achieve objectives in and through ⁵² TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE 104-05 (Michael N. Schmitt, ed. 2013) [hereinafter TALLINN MANUAL].": "⁵³ *Id.* ⁵⁴ *Id.* at 113–14.\n⁵⁵ *Id.* at 106–10.\n⁵⁶ *Id.* at 104–05.\n⁵⁷ *Cyber*, DICTIONARY OF MILITARY AND ASSOCIATED TERMS, U.S. DEP’T DEFENSE 57–58 (8 Nov. 2010 as amended through 15 Feb. 2016), http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/new_pubs/jp1_02.pdf [https://perma.cc/5UH8-B36A].\n⁵⁸ *Id.* cyberspace.⁵⁹ Offensive cyberspace operations are those intended to project power by the application of force in and through cyberspace.⁶⁰ Defensive cyberspace operations are the passive and active cyberspace operations carried out to preserve the ability to use friendly cyberspace capabilities to protect data, networks, and other systems.⁶¹ Examples of cyber warfare include the gaining of access to a computer system to acquire control over it, transmission of viruses to destroy or alter data, use of logic bombs to sit idle in a system until a set time or occurrence, and insertion of a worm to reproduce until a system is overloaded.⁶² Understanding cyber warfare allows for a better understanding of how the LOAC principles are to be applied in the cyber domain.\nThe LOAC principles of proportionality, humanity, military necessity, and distinction apply to States operating in cyberspace in very much the same way as they apply in the physical domains.⁶³ However, conducting operations in the cyber domain complicates the process because the operations are being carried out in an environment that is unreal and inherently unstable.⁶⁴ Targeting for computer network attacks presents legal issues that are just as complex as physical attacks.⁶⁵ Accordingly, States must exercise caution when planning and carrying out operations in cyberspace to ensure civilians are being protected. To do so, States conduct network reconnaissance for both operational requirements, as well as to ensure planned attacks do not cause collateral damage and casualties outside of what is acceptable under LOAC principles.⁶⁶ ⁵⁹ Id.\n⁶⁰ Id.\n⁶¹ Id.\n⁶² David Turns, *Cyber Warfare and the Notion of Direct Participation in Hostilities*, 17 J.

INT’L L. 391 (2010).\n⁶⁶ Id.\n[Vol. XLII There are some scholars and experts who view cyber operations as falling outside of the reach of the UN Charter or LOAC. Due to the UN Charter being written long before the advent of the Internet, the UN Charter was not written with a clear intention of including cyber operations.⁶⁷ Scholars and experts adhering to this view believe the UN Charter encompasses only physical attacks, and cyber operations will almost certainly not involve the use of physical force.⁶⁸ According to this line of thought, a country would not violate LOAC by deliberately launching cyber operations at civilian-owned targets.⁶⁹ However, the Tallinn Manual examines cyber operations as falling under the UN Charter and being subject to LOAC.⁷⁰ The LOAC principle of distinction, as codified in Additional Protocol I, and incorporated into the Tallinn Manual, requires that parties to an armed conflict distinguish between the civilian population and combatants, as well as between civilian objects and military objectives.⁷¹ This requirement seeks to protect civilians and their property by holding the parties to armed conflict accountable for the targets they choose to attack. Further, the principle of distinction precludes any rationale or justification by a party for an attack not permitted by LOAC.⁷² In cases where there is doubt as to whether a person is a civilian in the cyber domain, that person shall be considered a civilian.⁷³ This requirement complicates the cyber battlefield, because there are many civilians using computers and computer networks, and it may be very difficult to discern who is and is not a civilian.\nDetermining whether actors in the cyberspace domain are civilians, and may possibly be targeted when directly participating in hostilities during an international armed conflict, is difficult. Inaccurate attribution in cyberspace may leave vulnerable the civilians caught in the crossfire. The International Court of Justice maintains high standards for requisite attribution of an armed attack, and in the cyber domain, attribution for the act and actor ⁶⁷ See Cyber, supra note 57.\n⁶⁸ Id.\n⁶⁹ Id.\n⁷⁰ See TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 52.\n⁷¹ Geneva Convention, supra note 2, art. 14; Geneva POW, supra note 34, art. 4.\n⁷² TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 52, at Rule 33.\n⁷³ Id.\nare difficult to prove with scientific certainty.⁷⁴ Further, this attribution on the Internet is “the most technologically challenging level of attribution,” because the attributing party is seeking “to determine the original individual or entity that is responsible for launching the attack.”⁷⁵ In the United States, the White House, State Department, and Department of Defense recognize the need to treat cyber operations as potentially falling under the UN Charter and requiring a LOAC determination prior to employment.⁷⁶ Specifically, there is concern from these agencies that the use of cyber weapons could trigger unintended consequences and might harm diplomatic relations.⁷⁷ Senior military officials have stated that attribution of cyber-attacks has remained a challenge, and that challenge factors into the difficulty of determining what constitutes a cyber act of war.⁷⁸ Further, the National Security Director and U.S. Cyber Command chief has stated that the United States needs to think outside of the cyber realm regarding retaliation, and it needs to define acceptability limits regarding hacking.⁷⁹ In addition, the United States needs to prepare a set of capabilities and show its determination for using them.⁸⁰ Members of the U.S. Congress have echoed the need for cyber deterrence ⁷⁴ See Jason F.

The Objects of Cyber Attacks The Tallinn Manual also discusses who may be made the object of cyber-attacks and lists them as: 1) members of the armed forces; 2) members of organized armed groups; 3) civilians taking a direct part in hostilities; and 4) participants in a *levée en masse* during an international armed conflict.⁸⁷ It should be noted that the first two categories can be made the object of an attack based on their status; however, the last two categories can only be made targets based on their actions. Members of organized armed ⁸¹ *Id.* ⁸² *Id.* ⁸³ Patrick Tucker, *NSA Chief: Rules of War Apply to Cyberwar*, Too, DEF.

Inhabitants of unoccupied territory during an international armed conflict who engage in cyber operations as part of a levée en masse are afforded combatant immunity and prisoner of war status.⁹³ In addition, participants in a cyber-based levée en masse are targetable throughout the period of their participation therein.⁹⁴ To be considered a levée en masse, the participating individuals must be inhabitants of non-occupied territory, who upon the invading enemy’s approach, take up arms to resist them.⁹⁵ In the cyber context, “taking up arms” refers to engaging in cyber operations against the enemy.⁹⁶ This “taking up arms” in cyberspace is theoretical based on the facts that would have to exist for a cyber levée en masse to be ⁸⁸ *Id.* ⁸⁹ *Id.* ⁹⁰ Nils Melzer, *Interpretive Guidance on the Notion of Direct Participation Under International Humanitarian Law*, INT’L COMM.

The difference is the virtually untested nature of the cyberspace domain. It remains unclear exactly how States are to behave in cyberspace, what rises to the level of a cyber-attack, and what level of physical domain response is authorized for a particular cyber-attack. These and other unresolved translations from the physical realm to the cyber domain make difficult the protection of civilians during an international armed conflict. A step further would be the impact on civilians when they decide to directly participate in cyber hostilities.",
    "## IV. Civilians Directly Participating in Hostilities in the Cyberspace Domain The Tallinn Manual provides that, based on LOAC principles, there is no bar of any category of person from participating in cyber operations, whether during an international or non-international armed conflict.¹⁰² However, civilians participating in an armed conflict through cyber operations would likely not be entitled to prisoner of war status and combatant immunity, and they could be targeted based on their participation.¹⁰³ The ⁹⁷ *Id.* ⁹⁸ Geneva POW, *supra* note 34, art. 4.": "⁹⁹ *Id.* ¹⁰⁰ *Id.* ¹⁰¹ *Id.* ¹⁰² TALLINN MANUAL, *supra* note 52, at Rule 25.\n¹⁰³ *Id.* at Rule 25, comment 2.\nentitlement to combatant immunity and prisoner of war status are dependent upon the individual being engaged in an international armed conflict, as opposed to solely a non-international armed conflict or actions not rising to the level of armed conflict.¹⁰⁴ Even if civilians participate in hostilities, the majority of the International Group of Experts agree that civilians retain their civilian status.¹⁰⁵ However, civilians remain subject to prosecution under the applicable domestic laws of the States capturing them.¹⁰⁶ ## A. Defining Direct Participation in Hostilities As previously mentioned, civilians can be made the object of cyber-attacks if they are directly taking part in hostilities. Though civilians are protected from attack during international armed conflicts, they lose that protection if and for so long as they directly participate in hostilities.¹⁰⁷ This protection from attack and subsequent loss of protection only applies to civilians; it does not apply to members of armed forces, organized armed groups, or participants in a *levée en masse*.¹⁰⁸ Further, members of groups failing to qualify as organized armed groups would also qualify as civilians under this rule.¹⁰⁹ For example, a group would fail to be recognized as an organized armed group if they lack the required level of organization or if they fail to maintain a continuous combat function.¹¹⁰ Conducting operations in cyberspace that may rise to the level of direct participation in hostilities can be better understood by looking at the functions or tasks carried out in the cyber domain. Those involved in cyber operations seemingly fall in to three main categories according to their functions: 1) those who design or write the programs used for offense or defensive cyber operations; 2) those who install these programs on computer systems, act as service administrators, and provide technical maintenance; and 3) ¹⁰⁴ *Id.* at Rule 25.\n¹⁰⁵ *Id.* at Rule 29.\n¹⁰⁶ *Id.* at Rule 29.\n¹⁰⁷ *Id.* at Rules 32, 35.\n¹⁰⁸ Geneva POW, *supra* note 34, art. 4; TALLINN MANUAL, *supra* note 52, at Rule 35.\n¹⁰⁹ *Id.* ¹¹⁰ *Id.* art. 4; Melzer, *supra* note 90, at Part I.2.b.\n[Vol. XLII those who actually operate the computer programs.¹¹¹ A lone civilian could presumably be filling all of these roles in a solo operation.\nWhen civilians directly participate in hostilities through cyber operations during an international armed conflict, they are liable to be attacked either through cyber means or other lawful means under LOAC.¹¹² IHL does not define direct participation in hostilities, so direct participation must be interpreted in good faith according to the ordinary meaning and the context based on the object and purpose of IHL.¹¹³ Treaty law in this area refers to hostilities in terms of international or non-international armed conflict, so that should be the threshold; hostilities cannot refer to internal disturbances, riots, or isolated and sporadic events.¹¹⁴ Not all conduct during an armed conflict constitutes part of hostilities.¹¹⁵ Civilian participation in hostilities can occur in various forms and intensity levels in a wide variety of geographical, cultural, political, and military contexts, so the circumstances at the relevant time and place of the hostilities should be examined.¹¹⁶ The direct participation in hostilities refers to specific acts, which are carried out by individuals as part of the hostilities between two parties in an armed conflict.¹¹⁷ There are therefore two elements: 1) direct participation; and 2) hostilities. Participation in hostilities can either be direct or indirect; direct participation is the engagement in specific hostile acts.¹¹⁸ The concept of hostilities is best described as the aggregate of all hostile acts carried out by all individuals, either armed forces, organized armed groups, or civilians, during an armed conflict.¹¹⁹ The specific acts carried out by civilians qualify as direct participation in hostilities if they meet all of the following criteria: ¹¹¹ Cyber, supra note 57.\n¹¹² Geneva POW, supra note 34, art. 4; TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 52, at Rule 35.\n¹¹³ Melzer, supra note 90, at Part II.B.\n¹¹⁴ Id.\n¹¹⁵ Id.\n¹¹⁶ Id.\n¹¹⁷ Id. at Part VI.\n¹¹⁸ Id.\n¹¹⁹ Melzer, supra note 90, at Part VI.\nIn addition to meeting the threshold of harm, the second criterion requires there also be a direct causal link between the act and the harm. For there to be direct causation, there must be a sufficiently close causal relationship between the act and the resulting harm.¹²³ Specifically, direct causation should be brought about in one causal step.¹²⁴ Individual actions that can be viewed as merely supporting one side to an armed conflict or that only build up or maintain the capacity of a party is excluded from the concept of direct participation in hostilities.¹²⁵ For example, providing supplies for a party or financing the actions of a party to an armed conflict would bring about a result, but there is not direct causation for the potential harm. Other examples of indirect participation would be scientific research and design, recruitment and the training of personnel, and the production or transportation of weapons or equipment.¹²⁶ The third criterion requires there be a belligerent nexus, which is that an act must be specifically designed to directly cause the required threshold of harm in support of a party to the armed conflict.¹²⁷ Accordingly, the act must be objectively likely to inflict harm, and it must be specifically designed to do so in ¹²⁰ *Id.* at Part V.\n¹²¹ *Id.* ¹²² *Id.* ¹²³ *Id.* at Part V.2.b.\n¹²⁴ *Id.* at Part V.2.f.\n¹²⁵ Melzer, *supra* note 90, at Part V.\n¹²⁶ *Id.* at Part V.2.b.\n¹²⁷ *Id.* at Part V.3.\n[Vol. XLII] support of a party to the armed conflict.¹²⁸ Therefore, violence that is not designed to harm a party to an armed conflict cannot amount to direct participation in hostilities.¹²⁹ This type of violence is left solely to domestic law enforcement measures and not LOAC or IHL. The belligerent nexus requirement is important, because there are many activities during armed conflict that cause a considerable level of harm but fall short of direct participation in hostilities. This is exemplified by violent crimes committed for reasons unrelated to the conflict, such as robberies or murders, as well as the theft of military equipment for private use or sale.¹³⁰ Also requiring special attention is use of individual self-defense or defense of others. If a civilian uses force to protect his property from looting, he is not doing so with a belligerent nexus.¹³¹ Instead, he is acting out of self-defense.\nUnderstanding whether hostilities by civilians during armed conflict rise to the level of direct participation is not enough. The defining moment of when the direct participation in hostilities begins and ends is also important. Preparatory measures leading up to the execution of the specific act, and the movement to and from the location of the execution, all constitute integral parts of the act.¹³² Accordingly, IHL concerns itself with more than just exactly when the act took place; it looks at the totality of the circumstances surrounding the civilian’s direct participation in hostilities.¹³³ This is a significant point, because civilians lose their protection against direct attacks for such time as they directly participate in hostilities.¹³⁴ Preparatory measures are those that IHL would describe as military operations in preparation for an attack and which are so closely linked to the execution of the specific act that they constitute an integral part of the act.¹³⁵ Even so, there is no requirement that the preparatory measures occur immediately prior to the specific act or even in close geographic proximity to the place of the specific act.¹³⁶ An example in the physical domain would be a civilian who builds a bomb in his garage, which he intends to place in the road in order to blow it up and injure armed forces during an international armed conflict. In this illustration, the preparatory measures taken by the civilian bomb maker in his garage, as well as the transit to and from the place where he plants the bomb, would all be considered part of the direct participation in hostilities. Thus, the bomb maker could be targeted at any point from when he starts building the bomb in his garage until he returns home from planting it. Also included in general preparatory measures would be the transporting of personnel, gathering of intelligence, and equipping and instructing armed forces.¹³⁷ Where the execution of a hostile act does not require deployment, such as hostilities in cyberspace, the duration of the act should be limited to the immediate execution of the act.¹³⁸ ## B. Tallinn Manual View of Direct Participation in Hostilities The Tallinn Manual’s International Group of Experts generally agrees with the three cumulative criteria for qualification as a direct participation in hostilities as applied to cyberspace.¹³⁹ First, there must be a threshold of harm, wherein the civilian has the intended or actual effect of negatively affecting the military operations or capabilities of a party to an armed conflict or inflicting death, physical harm, or material destruction on persons or objects protected against direct attack.¹⁴⁰ Physical damage to objects or harm to individuals is not required, so long as the cyber act negatively affects the party militarily.¹⁴¹ Second, there must be a direct causal link between the act and the harm intended.¹⁴² An example would be a civilian conducting cyber acts against an armed force in international armed conflict, wherein the civilian disrupts the command and control, even temporarily, for the armed force. Finally, there must be a belligerent nexus established by the ¹³⁶ *Id.* ¹³⁷ *Id.* ¹³⁸ Melzer, *supra* note 90, at Part VI.\n¹³⁹ TALLINN MANUAL, *supra* note 52, at Rule 35, comment 4.\n¹⁴⁰ *Id.* ¹⁴¹ *Id.* ¹⁴² *Id.* [Vol. XLII act directly relating to the hostilities.¹⁴³ In cyberspace, direct participation in hostilities by civilians may be more difficult to delineate. Determining whether a civilian directly participated in conventional hostilities is complex by itself; making the same determination in cyber-hostilities is especially so.¹⁴⁴ Civilians conducting cyber-attacks related to an armed conflict would qualify as an act of direct participation in hostilities.¹⁴⁵ A cyber-attack is defined as a cyber operation that is reasonably expected to cause injury or death to persons or damage or destruction to objects.¹⁴⁶ Accordingly, civilians conducting cyber-attacks in this way would meet the three criteria for directly participating in hostilities. Other examples of direct participation include civilians conducting cyber operations with the intent to identify vulnerabilities in a targeted computer network or system, or civilians designing malware to take advantage of vulnerabilities in the systems of a party to an armed conflict.¹⁴⁷ Further examples in the cyber domain include civilians using cyber means to gather information on enemy operations and passing that information to the other armed force in the conflict as well as conducting distributed denial of service operations against military systems.¹⁴⁸ On the other hand, not all cyber operations by civilians would rise to the level of direct participation in hostilities. For example, designing malware for a specific purpose and making it available online, even if it is actually used by someone else to conduct an attack during an armed conflict, would not be considered direct participation.¹⁴⁹ What would be lacking would be the threshold of harm in the first criterion; the malware creator never had the intended or actual effect of negatively affecting military operations or capabilities. Another example would be civilians simply maintaining computer equipment generally, even if that equipment were eventually used in hostilities.¹⁵⁰ Again, what would be ¹⁴³ *Id.* ¹⁴⁴ Emily Crawford, *Virtual Battlegrounds: Direct Participation in Cyber Warfare*, 9 J. L. &amp; POL’Y INFO. SOC’Y 1 (2013).\n¹⁴⁵ TALLINN MANUAL, *supra* note 52, at Rule 35, comment 5.\n¹⁴⁶ *Id.* at Rule 30.\n¹⁴⁷ *Id.* at Rule 35, comment 5.\n¹⁴⁸ *Id.* ¹⁴⁹ *Id.* ¹⁵⁰ *Id.* missing is the threshold of harm at the first criterion.\nThe first criterion of the threshold of harm would also disqualify other cyber operations taken during an armed conflict. Cyber operations during an armed conflict that are taken for purely criminal or private reasons would not qualify as direct participation in hostilities.¹⁵¹ As an example, a criminal using cyber means to steal funds from a party to a conflict for purely personal gain, and not to negatively affect the party, would not be directly participating in hostilities. What is difficult about this example is that the party to the armed conflict would have to determine the intent of the civilian actor, which could be disguised as purely personal and criminal when it could in fact be aimed at adversely affecting the party to the conflict. Taken a step further, if the individual stole the money from the party in order to finance particular military operations, the operation to steal the money would be considered a direct participation in hostilities.¹⁵² Preparatory measures in cyberspace differ from those taken in the physical domain. Because civilians can be directly targeted for the duration of time during which they are directly participating in hostilities, it is important for parties to an armed conflict to understand the timeframe of direct participation.¹⁵³ The actions taken in cyberspace immediately preceding or subsequent to a qualifying act of direct participation are included in the preparatory measures.¹⁵⁴ As an example, a civilian travelling to and from the location of the computer he uses to mount a cyber operation would be included in the preparatory measures, and the civilian could be directly targeted in transit.¹⁵⁵ The time for preparatory measures may even extend as far backward and forward in time as the causal link to the action exists.¹⁵⁶ For example, in a cyber operation this would include the time when the civilian first starts to explore the vulnerabilities of the system of a party to an armed conflict, the time the individual creates the cyber tool to exploit the vulnerabilities, the period of time the civilian attacks the system, and through to the time the individual assesses ¹⁵¹ TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 52, at Rule 35, comment 6.\n¹⁵² Id.\n¹⁵³ Id.\n¹⁵⁴ Id. at Rule 35, comment 7.\n¹⁵⁵ Id.\n¹⁵⁶ Id.\n[Vol. XLII the damage to the system.\nIn addition to the preparatory measures taken for a cyber operation, parties to an armed conflict must take into account the delayed effects of direct participation in hostilities by civilians. The actions taken by civilians in the cyber domain have some parallels to the physical domain, but they also vary widely. The emplacement of a logic bomb, which is designed to activate at some point in the future upon either a command or after a predetermined period of time, is an example.¹⁵⁷ The majority of the Tallinn Manual’s International Group of Experts takes the position that the time frame for which the civilian is directly participating, and can thus be targeted, is from the beginning of his involvement in mission planning until the individual terminates his active role in the operation.¹⁵⁸ It is important to point out that the end of the period of direct participation may not sync up with the point when the damage occurs.¹⁵⁹ For example, the first civilian may have created and emplaced the logic bomb, which is awaiting a command prompt to activate it. A second civilian may be the one to actually command the bomb to activate. In this example, the first civilian could have halted his period of direct participation and would no longer be directly targetable when the damage actually occurs. Thus, the key is for parties to determine when individuals are targetable based on when their participation begins and ends.¹⁶⁰ ## C. Determination of Direct Participation in Hostilities Complicated by Cyberspace-Specific Issues The delayed effects of cyber operations complicate the accurate determination of precisely when a civilian is directly participating in cyber hostilities. The majority of the International Group of Experts takes the position that a civilian is directly participating in hostilities from the beginning of his involvement through the point in time where the civilian terminates an active role in the operation.¹⁶¹ The problem with this majority view is that it does not make clear to the participating civilian or to the ¹⁵⁷ TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 52, at Rule 35, comment 8.\n¹⁵⁸ Id.\n¹⁵⁹ Id.\n¹⁶⁰ Id.\n¹⁶¹ Id. at Rule 35, comment 6.\nState being attacked the window of time during which the civilian may be directly and legally targeted. The civilian may terminate an active role by no longer checking the status of the ongoing cyber operation, but the State may still attribute the operation to the civilian and target him. The State may not discover the ongoing cyber operation until after the civilian has terminated an active role, but the State has no way of knowing the civilian has terminated his active role in the ongoing cyber operation.\nThe logic bomb example parallels civilian operations in the physical world. Coalition Forces fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan faced road-side improvised explosive devices (“IEDs”), which were responsible for causing death and injury to troops as well as damage to military objects. If a civilian was responsible for building, transporting, emplacing, and setting off the IED, the civilian could be targeted throughout the entire process.¹⁶² The beginning and end of the civilian’s direct participation in hostilities could be measured from the time he began sourcing parts for the bomb until the time he set off the IED and transited back from the bombsite. Similarly, the civilian responsible for the logic bomb in the aforementioned example could be targeted from the time he began creating the logic bomb until he commands the logic bomb to activate. However, technology in the cyber domain varies widely from technology in the physical domain.\nIn the cyber domain, individuals can create programs capable of running autonomously or semi-autonomously. A computer network attack (“CAN”) is defined as either a cyber, electronic, or physical attack against an information technology facility or against computer equipment.¹⁶³ Most of these CNAs are carried out by cyber operations, which use malicious code to infect enemy computers in order to exploit weaknesses in software, system configuration, or computer security practices.¹⁶⁴ Cyber operations also include the use of bots, or remotely, or semi-autonomously controlled programs infecting computers, as well as botnets, which perform espionage by transmitting data between themselves while ¹⁶² *Id.* at Rule 35, comment 4 (providing that there is well-known, ongoing debate as to whether the assembly of an IED qualifies as direct participation in hostilities).\n¹⁶³ See generally CLAY WILSON, COMPUTER ATTACK AND CYBERTERRORISM 3-11 (2009) (providing insight on different types of attacks against computers).\n¹⁶⁴ *Id.* [Vol. XLII awaiting the final activation signal from the operator.¹⁶⁵ Malicious programs, such as spyware and malware, attack by disrupting normal computer functions or by opening a back door for a remote operator to take control of the computer.¹⁶⁶ Cyber operators have designed computer exploits which launch anonymously from thousands of infected computers and which produce waves of disruption to overwhelm the target of the operation.¹⁶⁷ The technology allowing autonomous and semi-autonomous operations in cyberspace makes difficult the task of determining the beginning and ending points of direct participation by civilians.¹⁶⁸ A minority of the Tallinn Manual Group of Experts would break down the various steps in cyber operations such as the emplacement of the logic bomb and its activation as separate acts of direct participation.¹⁶⁹ Under this view, the civilian would only directly participate in hostilities in intermittent instances when he is actively engaged in hostilities.¹⁷⁰ This view provides greater protection to civilians, as they are shielded from directly being targeted except for the times when they are actively engaged in cyber operations.¹⁷¹ However, this view would make it very difficult for the parties engaged in armed conflict to accurately determine when civilians are directly participating and then target the civilians participating in hostilities at precisely those times. The Group of Experts is split regarding repeated cyber operations. One view is in line with the ICRC in that each cyber act must be treated separately in terms of direct participation analysis.¹⁷² On the other hand, another view is that it would make more operational sense if direct participation begins with the first cyber operation and continues throughout the period of intermittent activity.¹⁷³ The latter view removes the “revolving door” effect and simplifies target ability by making the intermittent activity a singular, start-to-finish cyber operation.\nThe Tallinn Experts were also divided over the issue of presumption against direct participation.¹⁷⁴ Recall that the Tallinn Manual provides that in cases where there is doubt as to whether an individual is a civilian, that individual should be treated like a civilian.¹⁷⁵ The policy behind this principle is to ensure that civilians are protected to the utmost extent during armed conflicts. Some Tallinn Experts take this same line of thinking regarding civilians believed to be directly participating in hostilities.¹⁷⁶ These experts believe civilians in this predicament should be given the benefit of the doubt.¹⁷⁷ However, other Tallinn Experts take the position that when there is doubt as to whether a civilian is directly participating in hostilities, the attacking state must review the relevant information available and act reasonably in the circumstances in determining whether to conduct the attack.¹⁷⁸ The policy behind this method rests in the attacking state’s ability to identify which targets are legal targets based on a reasonable review of the available information. The importance of these two views cannot be understated. Some experts side with protecting civilians to the maximum extent possible, while others favor the States’ ability to act while following LOAC principles.\nAlthough the Tallinn Manual agrees with ICRC Guidance’s requirements of a threshold of harm—a causal link between the action and the harm and a belligerent nexus—generally, the Tallinn Manual’s application of the ICRC’s guidance is a variation of the ICRC’s direct participation in hostilities legal regime involving cyber actions.¹⁷⁹ The Tallinn manual does not have a requirement for physical damage to objects, so actions that may not qualify as cyber-attacks may still satisfy the criterion for the threshold of harm if the action has negatively affected the targeted State.¹⁸⁰ Specifically, the Tallinn Manual provides that a civilian’s ¹⁷⁴ Id. at Rule 35, comment 12.\n¹⁷⁵ TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 52, at Rule 33.\n¹⁷⁶ Id. at Rule 35, comment 12.\n¹⁷⁷ Id.\n¹⁷⁸ Id.\n¹⁷⁹ See Collin Allan, Direct Participation in Hostilities from Cyberspace, 50 VA.

For example, a civilian may be directly targeted under the Tallinn Manual view for his role in assembling and storing the cyber equivalent of an IED because the individual intends the same harm as the person arming and detonating it.¹⁸⁶ By comparing the Tallinn Manual’s view with the ICRC Guidance, it is possible that the Tallinn Manual lowers the standards for what is required for civilians to be directly participating in cyber hostilities.¹⁸⁷ Therefore, civilians participating in hostilities through cyber means may be targetable in more situations than under the ICRC framework.¹⁸⁸ ## V.

That is, they are defined as neither members of the armed forces, which includes groups assimilated to the armed forces such as organized armed groups, nor those participating in a levée en masse.¹⁸⁹ Essentially, all others are considered civilians. Private contractors and employees of a party to an armed conflict who fit the definition of civilians are entitled to protection from being directly targeted, unless they are directly participating in hostilities.¹⁹⁰ In addition, private contractors and civilian employees are not entitled to combatant immunity, as they are not members of the armed force.¹⁹¹ The activities carried out by contractors and employees as well as their location of duty may expose them to an increased risk of death or injury even if they are not directly participating in hostilities.¹⁹²",
    "## A. State-Affiliated Civilians": "Modern warfare is increasingly dependent upon private contractors and civilian employees to fill a variety of positions traditionally held by military personnel.¹⁹³ Generally, these private contractors and civilian employees are considered civilians under the same criteria that would apply to other civilians.¹⁹⁴ That is, they cannot be directly targeted by a party to the armed conflict unless and for so long as they directly participate in hostilities. Due to the special roles of private contractors and civilian employees and their proximity to armed forces in hostilities, parties to an armed conflict must make determinations regarding attacks with particular care and due consideration.¹⁹⁵\nThe majority of private contractors and civilian employees have been incorporated into State armed forces, but they do not\n---\n¹⁸⁹ See generally TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 52, Rule 29 (quoting the Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 Aug. 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts art. 50, § 1, June 8, 1977, 1125 U.N.T.S. 3).\n¹⁹⁰ Melzer, supra note 90.\n¹⁹¹ Id. at 38.\n¹⁹² Id. at 37.\n¹⁹³ Id.\n¹⁹⁴ Id.\n¹⁹⁵ Id.\n[Vol. XLII perform functions that would have them directly participate in hostilities.¹⁹⁶ Nevertheless, there are some contractor and civilians filling roles that would put them in situations where they could be seen as directly participating in hostilities. For example, private contractors and civilian employees that defend the base from attack could either be directly participating in hostilities or filling a law enforcement and defense-of-others role.¹⁹⁷ Even if they have accompanied armed forces, private contractors and civilians were never meant to (and should never be allowed to) directly participate in hostilities on behalf of a party to a conflict.¹⁹⁸ As long as they are not incorporated into armed forces, private contractors and civilian employees do not cease to be civilians, and they do not lose their civilian protection simply because they accompany armed forces.¹⁹⁹ Moreover, they do not lose their civilian protection just because they assume functions other than conducting hostilities, which traditionally would have been performed by members of armed forces.²⁰⁰ Contractors and civilian employees who directly participate in hostilities without the express authorization of the party to the armed conflict remain civilians, but they lose their protection from being directly targeted.²⁰¹ Contractors and employees can lose their civilian status if they have been incorporated into the armed forces of a party to a conflict.²⁰² If this happens, the contractors and employees would become members of an organized armed force under the command responsible for the party to the conflict and would no longer qualify as civilians.²⁰³ --- ¹⁹⁶ See Melzer, *supra* note 90, at 37 (explaining the basic notion of direct participation in hostilities).\n¹⁹⁷ See *id.* at 44 (illustrating that “[t]he notion of direct participation in hostilities does not refer to a person’s status, function, or affiliation, but to his or her engagement in specific hostile acts”).\n¹⁹⁸ *Id.* at 38.\n¹⁹⁹ *Id.* ²⁰⁰ *Id.* ²⁰¹ *Id.* ²⁰² See Melzer, *supra* note 90, at 39 (explaining that “[a]s long as they are not incorporated into the armed forces, private contractors and civilian employees do not cease to be civilians simply because they accompany the armed forces and or assume functions other than the conduct of hostilities that would traditionally have been performed by military personnel”).\n²⁰³ *Id.* The Tallinn Manual’s international group of experts concurs that individual contractors and civilians may only be directly targeted based on their direct participation in hostilities during an armed conflict.²⁰⁴ However, there are issues that arise in cyberspace regarding the use of contractors and civilians to perform specific military operations. Unlike traditional warfare, where almost all military operations were carried out by troops and equipment, modern warfare introduces the use of cyber capabilities which conduct a portion of the military operations. An example is the hiring of a private company by a party to an armed conflict that is later contracted to perform specific military operations.²⁰⁵ Based on the military operations, the company would qualify as an organized armed group belonging to the party to the conflict.²⁰⁶ Therefore, the civilians employed as private contractors would be considered belonging to the organized armed group. However, even if the civilians were not to be considered as belonging to the organized armed group, they would still only be directly targetable when and if they are directly participating in hostilities.²⁰⁷ Civilian government employees are also employed in positions requiring them to conduct cyber operations during an armed conflict, such as positions within an intelligence agency.²⁰⁸ If the group of civilians conducting cyber operations qualifies as an organized armed group, the civilian members are subject to attack regardless of direct participation in hostilities.²⁰⁹ Otherwise, the civilian employees are only directly targetable when they are directly participating in hostilities. As a result, the historic view of citizens carrying out actions typically performed by members of armed forces may be problematic when analyzing the cyber domain construct. The traditional view of warfare holds that private contractors and civilian employees operating in an organized armed group, affiliated with armed forces in an armed conflict, would not be entitled to combatant status.²¹⁰ [Vol. XLII] Furthermore, a party to the armed conflict employing civilians to perform intelligence functions, attack execution, or other CNA operations would violate the law of war.²¹¹ The reasoning behind this view is that only members of armed forces or assimilated organizations are granted combatant status because they meet the following conditions: (i) they are commanded by a person responsible for his subordinates; (ii) they have a fixed distinctive emblem recognizable at distance; (iii) they carry arms openly; and (iv) they conduct their operation in accordance with the laws and customs of war.²¹² Accordingly, under the traditional view, parties to an armed conflict should employ members of the armed force to carry out CNA functions, and if they desire contractors or civilian employees to fill these roles, then the parties should incorporate them into the regular armed forces.²¹³ Due to the vastly different landscape and operations carried out in cyberspace as opposed to the physical domain, a suggested course of action would be to rely less on the aforementioned four conditions and instead look to state affiliation.²¹⁴ The four criteria from the 1874 Brussels Declaration apply perfectly to traditional warfare, but operations in cyberspace are conducted without the need of having a fixed recognizable emblem or of carrying arms openly. By requiring state affiliation for civilian employees, it preserves concern for the principle of distinction in CNA from the Brussels criteria.²¹⁵ States employing civilians to conduct cyber operations are less likely to be doing so to prevent the enemy from attacking the civilians.²¹⁶ Instead, States are likely taking advantage of the economic, training, and recruiting advantages that develop as a result of not being limited to armed forces filling these behind-the-lines roles.²¹⁷ The fact that cyber operations take ON CYBER CONFLICT, 235, 242 (2012), https://ccdcoe.org/cycon/2012/proceedings/d2r1s10_watts.pdf [https://perma.cc/X6F2-TTRP] [hereinafter Notion of Combatancy].\n²¹¹ Id.\n²¹² See id. at 245 (citing the Project of an International Declaration Concerning the Laws and Customs of War, Aug. 27, 1874, 4 Martens Nouveau Recueil (ser. 2) 219 (“1874 Brussels Declaration”)).\n²¹³ Id.\n²¹⁴ Id.\n²¹⁵ Id.\n²¹⁶ See Notion of Combatancy, supra note 210, at 246.\n²¹⁷ Id.\nplace far from the battlefield also bolsters the position of state affiliation, because there is no concern that the enemy will be confused regarding distinction in targeting.²¹⁸ Under the state affiliation view of civilians taking part in cyber operations, discipline in warfare will continue to be preserved as it is under the four Brussels criteria.²¹⁹ Currently, civilians directly participating in hostilities are not subject to the internal military disciplinary system.²²⁰ However, the well-developed legal regimes that prosecute and punish war crimes operate in a manner to vindicate concerns for discipline and humanity.²²¹ In addition to international enforcement bodies, domestic criminal codes now serve as mechanisms where civilians are equally susceptible to prosecution for any war crimes they have committed.²²² Under the state-affiliation view, States will be able to employ civilians to conduct cyber operations while enabling combatant status. States will also be able to maintain the critically important notions of distinction and discipline as provided under the four Brussels criteria.²²³ States employing private contractors and civilian employees do so because of the different landscape and types of operations carried out in cyberspace. As they are written and observed, current LOAC principles, ICRC guidance, and the Tallinn Manual hold that civilians operating in cyberspace in a way that directly participates in hostilities are subject to directly being targeted but are not given combatant immunity. The view of letting state-affiliation drive combatant status determinations for cyberspace operations provides civilians with combatant status, or a version of it, while parties to an armed conflict can still conduct warfare and be no worse off. Currently, parties to an armed conflict operating in cyberspace are left with the difficult task of making determinations regarding direct participation in hostilities by civilians operating anonymously. The state-affiliation view would, at the least, put civilians on notice of what their consequences of participation entail, as well as protect them by [Vol. XLII] giving them some version of combatant immunity for their actions in armed conflict.\nA comparison of state-affiliated actors versus non-state-affiliated actors may lead to different statuses for each. When viewed as either contractors, who are working on behalf of a State engaged in an international armed conflict, or hacktivists, who operate outside of the control of the State but engage in cyber operations in favor of the State, the statuses of each may be seen as divergent.²²⁴ While neither of the two would qualify for combatant immunity, based on the four requirements provided by the Third Geneva Convention,²²⁵ contractors would have the best shot at being entitled prisoner-of-war (“POW”) status.²²⁶ Due to the nature of their service, contractors accompanying an armed force likely carry identification cards associating them with the armed force.²²⁷ Accordingly, contractors would not be given combatant status, but they would be more likely than hacktivists to be given POW status.²²⁸ Civilians accompanying armed forces are afforded some protection, but that protection comes with the inherent danger of accompanying armed forces.

The majority of the participation by a state-affiliated civilian cyber scientist would be viewed as indirect participation.²³² However, there are possible situations where a civilian’s particular expertise could have an exceptional and potentially decisive value for the outcome of an armed conflict.²³³ An example would be a computer programmer who researches and writes attack programs, one of which is used to incapacitate the enemy’s network controlling the launch of weapons systems.²³⁴ In this example, the civilian scientist could be responsible for the turning point in the conflict, thus shifting his participation from indirect to direct.²³⁵ The importance of this example is that the State hosting the state-affiliated civilian and the civilian need to understand the possible implications of having the scientist participate, directly or indirectly, in hostilities. Further, the enemy State is going to have to make a call as to whether it can directly target the civilian scientist or attack the military target and consider the scientist collateral damage.",

Non-State-Affiliated Civilians Non-state-affiliated civilians, also known as patriotic hackers or hacktivists, are the civilians directly participating in hostilities armed forces’ (presumably those who operate and maintain those systems)—even if they do not actually press the button that launches a cyberattack—are both eligible for prisoner-of-war status and also legitimate military targets for the enemy”).": "²³¹ *Id.* ²³² *See id.* at 291–92 (stating that “there is a high probability that many, if not most, of the personnel substantively involved in cyber operations may actually be civilians”).\n²³³ *See id.* at 292 (discussing that “[c]omputer technicians, technical maintenance personnel and others who perform similar tasks... could thus qualify for inclusion in the limited category of ‘persons who accompany the armed forces without actually being members thereof’”).\n²³⁴ *See id.* at 291 (distinguishing computer programmers who research and write attack programs from operators who execute cyber attacks).\n²³⁵ Turns, *supra* note 62, at 291.\n[Vol. XLII] on their own volition, so they will likely receive no protection under LOAC. These hackers carry out cyber operations against perceived enemy computer systems, without the control or oversight from their government but seek common political ends.²³⁶ Hacktivists would seem to receive no protection due to their direct participation in hostilities; however, hacktivists could arguably be considered participants in a *levée en masse* if they took up arms spontaneously upon the enemy approaching, lack organization, and carried arms openly.²³⁷ If so, hacktivists would be entitled to POW status, but they could be directly targeted while directly participating in hostilities.²³⁸ The LOAC principles have not been updated for cyber operations, so it is difficult to play out exactly how non-state-affiliated civilians are to be treated during international armed conflicts. Ideally, IHL would be universally understood by states engaged in armed conflict and the non-state-affiliated civilians who choose to directly participate in cyber hostilities would be on notice as to how their actions will be measured.\nAlso, made difficult by the landscape and types of operations carried out in cyberspace is the direct targeting of those individuals directly participating. Aside from anonymity being a difficult hurdle in cyberspace, the determination as to whether a physical attack is justified in response to a cyber action is still theoretical. Furthermore, neither treaties nor customary international law have established the illegality of espionage, either in the physical world or in cyberspace. Thus, civilians conducting CNAs on behalf of a State which is party to an armed conflict may not be directly participating in hostilities. Further, customary international law has not recognized data manipulation and deletions as rising to the level of hostilities, so civilians conducting these types of CNAs would not be directly participating in hostilities.",

A major concern with this LOAC application is the effect it has on civilians. As the law of war has evolved, the protection of civilians has been one of the key tenets from the outset. The Fourth Geneva Convention sought to protect civilian persons taking no part in hostilities as well as the wounded and sick.²³⁹ The Convention also prohibited an occupying power from destroying real and personal property belonging to civilians.²⁴⁰ The Additional Protocol I of the Geneva Convention calls for the protection of civilians from unnecessary injury or death and obliges combatants to distinguish themselves from the civilian population while engaged in an attack.²⁴¹ The civilian population is specifically protected under Part IV, which demands the parties to at all times distinguish between civilian population and combatants as well as between civilian objects and military objectives.²⁴² Further, Protocol I prohibits parties from making the civilian population the object of an attack, which also prohibits acts or threats having the intent to terrorize the civilian population.²⁴³\nThe protections provided by LOAC are two-fold. On one hand, they are meant to inform parties to an armed conflict regarding how to conduct themselves while at war. On the other hand, LOAC provides notice to civilians affected by armed conflict as to the treatment they can expect from the parties to the conflict. The relative nuance of cyberspace operations, as compared to traditional warfare, makes difficult the determination of direct participation in hostilities by citizens. If LOAC principles are incapable of adequately putting parties to armed conflict and citizens on notice, it should be amended for this purpose.\n²³⁹ Geneva Convention, supra note 2, art. 15.\n²⁴⁰ Id.\n²⁴¹ Id. art. 44.\n²⁴² Protocol I, supra note 1, art. 48.\n²⁴³ Id. art. 51.\n[Vol. XLII ## A. Temporal Considerations in the Cyber Domain Direct participation in hostilities by civilians operating in the cyber domain is vastly different than participation in the physical domain due to temporal considerations. Actions taken in cyberspace are not easily detected as they are happening, and they are often created for use in the future. For example, computer network attacks involve the use of malicious code to either infect an enemy’s computer system or to exploit weaknesses in the software, system configuration, or security practices.²⁴⁴ Additionally, bots and even botnets are remotely-controlled or semi-autonomous computer programs that infect computers and systems to transmit data obtained by the system or instruct the system to operate a certain way.²⁴⁵ Hackers have even designed ways to exploit computers and systems in a way to launch programs anonymously and autonomously from thousands of infected computers.²⁴⁶ Accordingly, cyber operations differ greatly from physical operations due to the timing of how the operations are carried out. Cyber operations can be set to take place at a certain time in the future or after a certain event has occurred.\nThe ICRC Guidance and the Tallinn Manual both touch on these temporal considerations. The ICRC provides that preparatory acts can be treated as separate acts and distinguished from the act that is the object of the direct participation in hostilities.²⁴⁷ Therefore, a civilian participating in hostilities may ²⁴⁴ See WILSON, supra note 163, at 39 (explaining the characteristics of malicious code).\n²⁴⁵ Id. at 38 (explaining that “[a]utomated programs, or ‘bots’... are increasingly autonomous, rapid, and difficult to detect... [and] can be remotely controlled by commands sent through the Internet and can be activated to operate in a coordinated manner on thousands of computers in different locations around the world”); see id. at 41 (explaining that “[s]ome compromised computers become part of an automatic ‘bot network,’ quietly performing espionage by transmitting data or intermediate preparatory instructions back and forth between compromised computers while awaiting a special final activation signal originating from the attacker”).\n²⁴⁶ See id. at 43 (explaining that “hackers have also designed recent computer exploits that launch anonymously from thousands of infected computers to produce waves of disruption that can quickly overwhelm a targeted organization, or multiple organizations such as a list of banking institutions”).\n²⁴⁷ See Melzer, supra note 90, at 68 (stating that “[w]here the execution of a hostile act does not require geographic displacement, as may be the case with computer network attacks or remote-controlled weapons systems, the duration of direct participation in conduct a series of acts, each directly participating in hostilities, over a period of time that lead up to the object of the direct participation. The Tallinn Manual provides that the scope of direct participation includes the actions immediately preceding and those subsequent to the qualifying act of direct participation in hostilities.²⁴⁸ The majority of the Tallinn Experts agree that a civilian is directly targetable only for the duration of the direct participation in hostilities, regardless of when the actual effects are realized.²⁴⁹ Yet, some of the experts take the position that the time period during which a civilian can be directly targeted extends for as long as there is a causal link to the intended harm.²⁵⁰ That is, a civilian is targetable as far upstream and as far downstream as that civilian’s causal link exists between the action taken and the intended harm.²⁵¹ As an example, a civilian may be targeted as early as when he begins a cyber operation by probing the enemy’s system and carry through to when he conducts the cyber operation against the system.²⁵² The civilian may even be targeted after the cyber operation, when he is conducting a damage assessment and determining whether to conduct another operation against the system.²⁵³ These temporal considerations are worth exploring because they mostly exist only in the cyber context. Accordingly, there may be a disconnect between how States view cyber operations versus operations in the physical world due to the way LOAC principles were developed for the physical world. Though it is possible to parallel these temporal considerations by discussing IEDs emplaced for the destruction of the enemy State’s equipment and the injury of its people, there is not a precise match. While IEDs can be emplaced with the intent of them going off in the future upon being activated, IEDs with this setup cannot be controlled and changed like their logic bomb counterpart in the cyber world. Applying LOAC principles to an IED would yield ²⁴⁸ TALLINN MANUAL, *supra* note 52, at Rule 35, comment 7.\n²⁴⁹ *Id.* at Rule 35, comment 8.\n²⁵⁰ *Id.* at Rule 35, comment 7.\n²⁵¹ *Id.* ²⁵² *Id.* ²⁵³ *Id.* [Vol. XLII the bomb maker likely being targetable while building the bomb, based on his intent, and the civilian emplacing the IED being targetable while emplacing the IED. It would not be as clean cut in the cyber world based on the ability of the logic bomb builder and the one who activates it to carry out the entire operation in complete anonymity as well as being able to control the logic bomb once it is emplaced.\nFor the sake of clarifying the discussion below, the civilians being discussed are non-state-affiliated civilians. State-affiliated civilians are those who operate as either private contractors on behalf of the State or as civilian employees, who are employed by the State. These civilians are better aware of their exposure to direct attack based on the nature of their service, which could include operational as well as geographic proximity to armed forces. Thus, the State and the state-affiliated civilians are on notice as to whether and for how long the civilians may be directly targeted by the opposing state during an armed conflict.\nAdditional Protocol I provides that civilians and civilian populations enjoy general protection against dangers arising from military operations.²⁵⁴ However, civilians forfeit this protection if and for so long as they directly participate in hostilities.²⁵⁵ Direct participation by civilians in cyberspace is not always clear. The International Group of Experts was split regarding repeated cyber operations by civilians that qualified as direct participation in hostilities.²⁵⁶ Some of the experts side with ICRC guidance, which provides that each act must be treated separately as separate acts of direct participation.²⁵⁷ Other experts conclude separate direct participation analysis made little operational sense and believe it would create a “revolving door” effect regarding targetability.²⁵⁸ This group of experts believes direct participation by the civilian begins with the first cyber operation he participates in and continues throughout the period of intermittent activity.²⁵⁹ This incongruent application of existing LOAC principles on cyberspace operations demonstrates the potential for civilians and ²⁵⁴ Protocol I, supra note 1, art. 51.\n²⁵⁵ Id.\n²⁵⁶ TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 52, Rule 35, comment 7.\n²⁵⁷ Id.\n²⁵⁸ Id.\n²⁵⁹ Id.\nparties to an armed conflict to misapply or misinterpret LOAC principles.\nWhat if a non-state-affiliated civilian were to create an autonomous logic bomb and release it with the intent to infiltrate and attack the computer network of the defense ministry of a State which is party to an ongoing armed conflict? At what point could the civilian be targeted by the State? If the State discovers the logic bomb months after it was released by the civilian, and assuming the State can attribute it to the civilian, can the State target the civilian then? Under ICRC guidance, the civilian could be directly targeted for each act of direct participation in hostilities.²⁶⁰ Accordingly, the civilian could be directly attacked when producing the logic bomb with the intent to launch a CNA against the State, if done so in support of another party to the conflict, and when the civilian actually launches the logic bomb.²⁶¹ However, ICRC guidance would not likely support a direct attack against the civilian if discovered months after it was launched. Under the Tallinn Manual’s viewpoint, the civilian may be directly targeted.²⁶² As discussed above, it may be unclear to civilians directly participating in hostilities in the cyber domain as to how their actions could be interpreted by parties to an armed conflict. Aside from civilians conducting intermittent direct participation in hostilities in cyberspace, civilians may also be unclear as to their exposure for direct targeting due to the uncertain application of LOAC principles to the cyber domain. Specifically, civilians launching autonomous or semi-autonomous programs to attack computer networks may directly participate in hostilities by building the code and program for the specific purpose as well as directly participate by launching the CNA.²⁶³ However, these civilians may at some point decide they no longer wish to pursue the action against a party to an armed conflict.\n²⁶⁰ JEAN-MARIE HENCKAERTS &amp; LOUISE DOSWALD-BECK, CUSTOMARY INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW VOL. 1: RULES 1, 21 (2005).\n²⁶¹ Id.\n²⁶² Id. at 23.\n²⁶³ Turns, supra note 62, at 281.\n[Vol. XLII ## B. Change of Heart for Civilians Directly Participating in Cyber Hostilities How might a civilian make clear to a State embroiled in an armed conflict that the civilian who conducted a cyber operation against the State no longer wishes to directly participate in cyber hostilities? In the physical domain, the civilian would simply stop shooting at the party, collecting arms to use against the party, building bombs to emplace in roadways, or collecting money to finance attacks against the party to the conflict.²⁶⁴ An example which could parallel the cyber domain would be a civilian bomb maker who makes a bomb and emplaces that bomb in a road in an effort to target a party to an armed conflict. However, the bomb maker could make clear his intentions to no longer directly participate by putting up a sign warning of the bomb, digging up the bomb, or telling the party the location of the bomb. In cyberspace, a civilian who creates the malicious code for the CNA and launches it may not be able to recall the code or stop the cyber operation once it has begun.²⁶⁵ Once the malicious code is discovered, the targeted State may attack the civilian because it is impossible to precisely determine if the civilian has stopped directly participating in cyber hostilities. The State could argue the civilian is still monitoring and directing the logic bomb or malicious code.\nThe advanced technology which enables civilians to directly participate in hostilities could make it difficult for both the civilian and the party to the armed conflict to know when the civilian is no longer directly participating.²⁶⁶ The civilian who produces the malicious code for a CNA concludes his direct participation when he stops working on or even finishes the code. Would the civilian who launches the malicious code for a CNA conclude his direct participation when the code is launched? What if the malicious code were autonomous or semi-autonomous, and it would continue to operate without the aid from the civilian? This would seem to be a magic bullet fired in the physical world. In the physical domain, the bullet would lose speed and fall to the earth. However, malicious code launched in the cyber domain may ²⁶⁴ *Id.* ²⁶⁵ *Id.* ²⁶⁶ *Id.* continue until it is discovered and counter by the attacked party or until it reaches its termination stage, if it has one. May the civilian launching this code be directly targeted until the malicious code ceases to operate as part of the CNA?\nCurrent interpretations by the ICRC and the International Group of Experts contributing to the Tallinn Manual apply IHL to the cyber domain and determine that the civilian launching the CNA code can only be targeted so long as he is directly participating in hostilities, which is when he is actively engaged.²⁶⁷ The ICRC and the Group of Experts are unwilling to extend the window of targetability to include ongoing hostilities set in motion by the individual unleashing the malicious code aimed at conducting a CNA.²⁶⁸ As previously stated in the magic bullet analogy, there is nothing to stop the CNA code except for the initiator, unless the attacked State becomes aware of the CNA and takes steps to defend against it. Accordingly, should not the attacked State be able to target the civilian initiator after he has set in motion the CNA? If the State is able to stretch the targetability window to legally target the initiating civilian so long as the CNA is underway, can the civilian limit his exposure in any way?\nA solution might be found in the American Law Institute’s Model Penal Code (“MPC”). The MPC defines criminal conspiracy as a person conspiring with another person or group of persons to commit a crime if the individual, with the purpose of promoting or facilitating the crime: 1) agrees with the other person or group that one or more of them will engage in conduct constituting a crime; or 2) agrees to aid the other person or group in planning or committing the crime.²⁶⁹ However, the actor may, after having conspired to commit a crime, use as an affirmative defense the fact that the actor thwarted the success of the conspiracy after having manifested a complete and voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.²⁷⁰ By renouncing his support for the crime and thwarting the success of the conspiracy, the actor is able to undo the effort he put into conspiring to commit the crime.\n²⁶⁷ Eva Knopova, *New IHL Framework for Cyber Warfare: Master’s Thesis*, CHARLES UNIV. PRAGUE DEP’T INT’L L. 47 (2016).\n²⁶⁸ Id.\n²⁶⁹ American Law Institute, *MODEL PENAL CODE § 5.03* (Tent. Draft No. 4, 1955).\n²⁷⁰ Id.\n[Vol. XLII] As applied to the above issue regarding civilians directly participating in cyber hostilities, a civilian putting into place malicious code capable of autonomously conducting a CNA may be able to be certain he cannot be directly targeted by the party to an armed conflict by renouncing his support for the cyber hostilities and working to thwart further cyber hostilities by the code.²⁷¹ By attempting to prevent future direct targeting, the civilian may inadvertently leave himself exposed to attack by making his actions and identity known to the party. However, a party to an armed conflict abiding by LOAC would not be able to target a civilian who is no longer participating in hostilities.²⁷² Further, the civilian may take similar actions to renounce his participation and thwart further action by the code in an anonymous way.\nBy adopting this view, States who are a party to an armed conflict have better ground rules as to how to legally target non-state-affiliated civilians who are participating in cyber hostilities in a way that may not be covered by current IHL.²⁷³ Additionally, under this view, civilians will have a better understanding of how their actions, carried out as cyber operations, will be treated by States who are a party to an armed conflict. This view provides States and civilians with notice of how actions by civilians will be treated in cyberspace. Further, this view provides civilians who have participated in cyber hostilities, and who may be determined to be still participating based on the autonomous CNA code the individual initiated, an opportunity to remove themselves from hostilities. By taking steps discussed in the MPC to remove oneself from a conspiracy, the initiating individual can undo the bonds currently opening himself up to being targeted by a party to the conflict.²⁷⁴ By coming forward, renouncing his support for the ongoing cyber hostilities, and attempting to thwart the object of the cyber ²⁷¹ HENCKAERTS &amp; DOSWALD-BECK, supra note 260, at 19–20.\n²⁷² See generally INT’L &amp; OPERATIONAL L. DEP’T., THE JUDGE ADVOCATE GEN.’S LEGAL CTR. &amp; SCH., U.S. ARMY, LAW OF ARMED CONFLICT DESKBOOK, 7 (2015) (explaining that “[o]nly combatants or those directly participating in hostilities may be targeted... [n]on-combatants, including civilians and persons out of combat, may not intentionally be targeted”).\n²⁷³ HENCKAERTS &amp; DOSWALD-BECK, supra note 260, at 19–20.\n²⁷⁴ American Law Institute, supra note 269.\noperation, a civilian may prevent the targeted State from directly targeting the civilian.²⁷⁵ However, the civilian may also be creating an unexpected repercussion. The civilian directly taking part in cyber hostilities, favoring a party to an armed conflict by conducting cyber operations against an opponent party, also exposes himself to domestic criminal law pertaining to the cyber operations. By coming forward, the civilian may be opening himself up to prosecution under domestic criminal law in an effort to prevent being directly targeted by the State against whom the civilian directly participated in hostilities.²⁷⁶ This may create a disincentive for civilians to expose themselves as ongoing direct participants in cyber hostilities, but the damage is already done.\nThe only question that remains is attribution. Can the attacked State determine who the civilian is for either direct targeting purposes or domestic criminal prosecution? If the civilian believes so, the civilian could limit his exposure to being directly attacked as well as request leniency from the domestic criminal prosecution for his cooperation.²⁷⁷ The alternative is for the civilian to figure out a way to completely remove every trace of his participation in an ongoing cyber operation, thereby ensuring the attacked State does not discover the cyber operation, attribute it to the civilian, and directly attack him.²⁷⁸ Without this possible outlet, civilians who have had a change of heart and no longer wish to participate in cyber hostilities may be targeted in the future for previous participation in cyber hostilities, of which they no longer wish to be a part. Though not a perfect method for keeping civilians safe from being directly targeted, this method provides notice to the attacking State of the civilian’s previous acts, which are the acts the civilian no longer wishes to be held accountable for in the realm of armed conflict. The civilian’s renouncing of previous participation in hostilities will not absolve him of domestic law implications, but it will ensure he is not targeted in the future.²⁷⁹ [Vol. XLII] # VII. Conclusion Civilians directly participate in hostilities for numerous reasons. State-affiliated civilians might engage in direct participation as part of their job; non-state-affiliated civilians might directly participate out of a sense of patriotism, helping the underdog, or feeling like part of the fight. Cyberspace creates an environment unlike any other ever seen before, so civilians and States who are a party to an armed conflict struggle to understand how LOAC principles apply to their conduct. A misunderstanding by a civilian could lead to a prolonged period of being directly targeted by a party to a conflict; a misunderstanding by that party could lead to allegations of war crimes. All sides to a conflict, to include civilians, would benefit from consensus in the application of LOAC to the cyber domain.\nA consensus in the application of LOAC principles in the cyber domain could lead to stronger footing for States and citizens as the cyberspace domain becomes a larger battleground. Cyberspace issues such as anonymity, attribution, temporal considerations, and equal application of force between the physical and cyber domains all highlight the need to better define LOAC applications to the cyber domain.²⁸⁰ Specifically, civilians should be able to renounce their direct participation in cyber hostilities, and they should no longer face direct targeting by a party to a conflict for cyber operations taken previously. The Tallinn Manual spells out that civilians may be directly targeted so long as their causal link to the action exists.²⁸¹ States subscribing to this view may link civilians to cyber operations carried out previously, even after civilians have walked away and no longer desire to directly participate.\nThe ability to target civilians for previous acts of cyber hostilities when States believe a causal link still exists may lead to an expanded window of time during which a civilian may be targeted. Thus, States who are party to a conflict should be able to know with certainty that the civilian they intend to target is a lawful target, due to the civilian’s ongoing intent to directly participate in hostilities. The renunciation clause found in the Model Penal Code could be the solution to ending ²⁸⁰ Turns, supra note 62, at 281.\n²⁸¹ Id.\nmisunderstandings by civilians and parties to a conflict regarding direct participation and targeting.²⁸² Under this view, civilians have a way to guarantee they will no longer be directly targeted for past cyber operations amounting to direct participation in hostilities when the State may not know the civilian’s participation has concluded. In addition, this view provides an out for States directly targeting civilians for directly participating in cyber hostilities against the State because the civilian has the opportunity and incentive to come clean if the civilian no longer wishes to directly participate. By coming forward, civilians may open themselves up to domestic prosecution, but they guarantee they will not be directly targeted by a State.\nA final point is examined by asking: should civilians have to go to such lengths to ensure they will not be directly targeted by a State for previous instances of direct participation in hostilities? Further, should LOAC require citizens to take active steps to put States on notice as to the citizens’ activities to prevent being illegally targeted after the direct participation in hostilities has concluded? An argument can be made that this policy would be requiring too much of civilians, and it exposes civilians to a lose-lose scenario.\nOn the one hand, civilians want to ensure the temporal anomalies in the cyber domain do not mislead States into falsely believing civilians are continuing to directly participate in hostilities after participation has ended. On the other, civilians want to protect against domestic prosecution and initiating an investigation into their activities. Though a possible solution to the issue of civilians being overly or illegally targeted could be found in the Model Penal Code, international law may not be willing to support the process or potential side effects to civilians providing notice to States that the civilians have withdrawn from the direct participation in hostilities.\n^{}[]"

Introduction\nThe Law of Armed Conflict (“LOAC”) has evolved over the past century and a half to protect civilians from the harms caused by war as well as to put all parties on notice as to their expected conduct. Civilians, like any other group, are not prohibited from directly participating in hostilities, but they lose their protection from being directly targeted for such time as they chose to do so. This protection for civilians is easier understood as it is applied to the physical domain, for which it was created. The cyber domain is vastly different. Accordingly, civilians and States who are party to international armed conflicts are left to apply their own understanding of how LOAC principles should be applied to the cyber domain.\nThe difference of interpretation by civilians and parties to armed conflict could leave civilians overly exposed to direct attack and parties accountable for war crimes. This is especially true for non-state-affiliated civilians conducting cyber hostilities against a State that is party to an armed conflict. The differentiation between state-affiliated and non-state-affiliated civilians matters, because state-affiliated civilians should understand they may be injured or killed based on their work alongside and their proximity to armed forces. Thus, they are likely on notice that they may be directly targeted if directly participating in hostilities as well as considered collateral damage during a legal attack by an enemy State. In addition, civilians may open themselves up to an extended period of time during which they may be directly targeted based on the type of cyber operation they conduct.\nVarying views support the notion that civilians intermittently participating directly in hostilities may be targeted throughout a linked-together period of participation. Further, if a civilian were to launch against a State a cyber operation that activates at a set point in the future or after a forecasted event, the State could possibly treat the civilian as directly participating in hostilities long after the civilian actually initiated and participated in the cyber operation. This delayed direct targeting of the civilian can happen either because the State is unaware of exactly when the cyber operation was launched against it or because it interprets its\n Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts, June 8, 1977, 110 Stat. 2104, 1125 U.N.T.S. 51 [hereinafter Protocol I].\n\nresponse as warranted under LOAC.\nAlong with opening themselves up to being directly targeted, civilians participating in cyber hostilities may also face domestic criminal law exposure for their cyber hostilities. States that are party to an armed conflict could seek to lawfully target the civilian rather than await a domestic law prosecution. A possible solution to civilians being overly exposed to direct attack for their decision to directly participate in cyber hostilities could come from the Model Penal Code’s view of renouncing one’s role and thwarting the overall success of the act. Under this theory, a civilian could make the enemy State aware of the civilian’s plot to conduct an ongoing cyber operation against the State in an effort to absolve the civilian of being targeted in the future. However, these civilians may still face domestic criminal law repercussions for doing so.\n## II. The Treatment of Civilians in Traditional Warfare\nWhether it is their own loss of life or injury, the loss or injury of a relative, or the collateral damage of their property, civilians always suffer during war. Accordingly, major nation states have been working together for over a century to address the way traditional wars are fought, and they have sought to add a sense of humanity and require discrimination in targeting. In 1949, major nation states acceded to the Fourth Geneva Convention, which was called “The Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War” and sought to protect noncombatants.\nPrior to the Geneva Conventions, civilians were left to the mercy of the combatants and their beliefs as to sparing civilians. The Geneva Conventions codified what had been inching closer to customary law for decades. The movement in this direction can be seen by the Lieber Code, which sought to regulate war; and later the Declaration of St. Petersburg in 1868, which prohibited the use of specific weapons for humanitarian reasons. The\n Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, Aug. 12, 1949, 110 Stat. 2104, 75 U.N.T.S. 287 [hereinafter Geneva Convention].\n See ANICÉE VAN ENGELAND, CIVILIAN OR COMBATANT?: A CHALLENGE FOR THE 21ST CENTURY ix-xix (2011).\n Id.\n Id. at 13–14.\n\n[Vol. XLII]\ninternational agreement formed at the 1874 Brussels Convention discussed laws and customs of war and provided that combatant forces are not granted unlimited power as to how to injure the enemy. This provision was later codified in the Hague Regulations of 1907, as was the general understanding of the need for discrimination between civilians and combatants. Additionally, the Hague Peace Conferences of 1899 and 1907 became the first internationally codified documents providing that civilians should not suffer from the effects of hostilities.\n## A. Geneva Convention and the Additional Protocol\nThe Fourth Geneva Convention, which occurred in 1949, specifically sought to protect civilians during times of war. Under the Fourth Geneva Convention, persons taking no active part in the hostilities are to be treated humanely and without regard to their faith, sex, race, or religion. In addition, parties to the conflict are to establish neutral zones in regions of combat to shelter wounded and sick combatants and civilians taking no part in hostilities from the effects of war. The wounded and the sick are specifically protected and should be provided particular care and respect.\nIn addition to the Fourth Geneva Convention, the Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (“Additional Protocol I”) is a 1977 amendment to the Geneva Convention that focuses on the protection of victims of international armed conflicts. Protocol I calls for the protection and care of the wounded, sick, and shipwrecked regardless of whether they are military or civilians. To protect civilians from unnecessary injury or death, Protocol I obliges combatants to distinguish themselves from the civilian population while engaged\n *Id.*\n *Id.*\n *Id.*\n See Geneva Convention, *supra* note 2.\n *Id.* art. 3.\n *Id.* art. 14.\n *Id.*\n Protocol I, *supra* note 1, art. 3.\n *Id.*\n\nin an attack. The civilian population is specifically protected under Part IV, which demands the parties to distinguish at all times between civilian populations and combatants; as well as between civilian objects and military objectives. Further, Protocol I provides that if there is doubt as to whether a person is a civilian, that person should be treated as a civilian. In addition, parties are prohibited from making the civilian population the object of an attack, or making acts or threats intended to terrorize the civilian population.\nProtocol I also protects civilians by prohibiting indiscriminate attacks such as those not directed at a specific military objective as well as the use of combat means that cannot be sufficiently limited. However, there are limits because the presence or movement of civilians will not render certain areas immune from military operations. For example, if a party to the conflict uses a movement of civilians to shield military objects, that party would be in violation of the Protocol. The purpose of the Additional Protocol is to protect civilians during armed conflicts, so a State using civilians as shields will be held accountable for the LOAC violation. In addition, the Hague Convention states that the right of belligerents to adopt means of injuring the enemy is not unlimited. By limiting the means used against the enemy, civilians are also protected from unnecessary suffering due to the type of weapons used in warfare. The purpose of the Hague Convention was to infuse humanity into armed conflicts. By forcing States to use approved weapons, which take into account human suffering, civilians are indirectly protected from inhumane weaponry.\nProtocol I requires precautionary measures to be taken during\n\n[Vol. XLII\nattack planning to limit the injury and death of civilians, as well as damage to civilian objects. Specifically, Article 57 instructs parties to take constant care in military operations to spare civilians and civilian objects by requiring parties to verify objectives to be attacked and to take all feasible precautions to avoid and minimize incidental loss of civilian life or injury. The parties must also refrain from launching any attack that may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, civilian injury, or loss of civilian property. Further, parties are required to cancel or suspend attacks if it becomes clear the objective is not a military one or that the attack will cause loss of civilian life or property or will cause civilian injuries. Protocol I also requires parties, to the maximum extent feasible, remove civilians and civilian objects from the vicinity of military objects. In addition, parties are to avoid locating military objects within or near densely populated areas. The purpose of these measures are to ensure States are being mindful of civilians and civilian property from the beginning of attack planning all the way through the attacks themselves.\n## B. Civilians Directly Participating in Hostilities\nProtocol I protects civilians when viewed as innocent bystanders, but what if civilians participate in hostilities? Under the Protocol, parties to an international armed conflict may only target civilians for such time as the civilians take a direct part in hostilities. At that point, the civilians lose their civilian status protection and can then be targeted by combatants as legally permissible. The timeframe for which civilians can be targeted while directly participating in hostilities is defined by Protocol I as the time during which they are participating. However, it is important to keep in mind that the right of the noncombatant population to protection involves a corresponding duty to abstain\n\nfrom hostilities.\nAs an example, if a civilian who is caught in the middle of an international armed conflict decides to pick up a rifle and shoot at a Party to the conflict, the Party’s armed force may target the civilian so long as the civilian poses a threat. If the civilian were to drop the rifle and run back to his house, he could no longer be targeted by the armed force. The targeting of civilians while directly participating in hostilities is rooted in LOAC; any potential domestic law violations would be determined by the civilian’s State. Civilians directly participating in hostilities may face repercussions based on their actions that violate domestic criminal laws as well as being targeted by the enemy State. The Third Geneva Convention also addresses civilians participating in hostilities.\nThe Third Geneva Convention (“Convention”) was adopted in 1949, and its purpose was the protection of the victims of war, both civilian and prisoner. This Convention mainly addresses the treatment of prisoners of war, but it also recognizes civilian participation in hostilities. Under this Convention, *levée en masse* is the spontaneous taking up of arms by civilian inhabitants of a non-occupied territory when the invading enemy approaches. In this case, the civilians would be allowed prisoner-of-war status because they participated in hostilities spontaneously, without the time to form themselves into regular armed units; but they must carry arms openly and respect the laws of war. Aside from prisoner of war status, LOAC also addresses combatant immunity and targetability.\nCombatant immunity is addressed in Protocol I, wherein it states that members of a Party’s armed force are combatants, and\n Karma Nabulsi, *Evolving Conceptions of Civilians and Belligerents: One Hundred Years After the Hague Peace Conferences, in CIVILIANS IN WAR 9, 16* (Simon Chesterman ed., 2001) (quoting Henry Richmond Droop, *On the Relations Between an Invading Army and the Inhabitants, and the Conditions Under Which Irregular Troops Are Entitled to the Same Treatment as Regular Soldiers*, TRANSACTIONS OF THE GROTIUS SOCIETY 713 (1871)).\n Geneva Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War art. 4, Aug. 12, 1949, 6 U.S.T. 3316, 75 U.N.T.S. 135 [hereinafter Geneva POW].\n *Id.*\n *Id.*\n *Id.*\n See Protocol I, supra note 1.\n\n[Vol. XLII]\nthey have the right to participate directly in hostilities. The term “combatant” excludes medical personnel, chaplains, and civilians. Accordingly, in international armed conflict, combatants enjoy immunity regarding their acts as part of hostilities, but it does not prohibit others from engaging in those types of hostilities. Although non-combatants are not specifically prohibited from engaging in hostilities during an armed conflict, they may be directly targeted by the enemy and may face domestic criminal charges for their actions. Therefore, civilians engaging in hostilities would not be entitled to the combatant immunity that is given to combatants participating in an international armed conflict. Thus, civilians would only be entitled to prisoner of war status in limited cases, and they would not be entitled to combatant immunity.\nRegarding targetability, civilians are not to be targeted by the parties to an armed conflict, and civilians are to be generally protected against the dangers arising from military operations. However, LOAC allows civilians to be targeted by an armed force if and for so long as the civilian is directly participating in hostilities. Therefore, civilians enjoy the freedom from targetability so long as they are not taking a direct part in the hostilities. This freedom from direct targetability extends to a point under LOAC. A State choosing to target a legal military objective must determine if civilians and their property may be damaged by the attack. If so, the State must conduct a balancing test to ensure the necessity of taking out the military objective outweighs the possible damage that could be caused to civilians and their property. In summation, civilians do not have combatant immunity, they may be granted prisoner of war status during a levée en masse, and they cannot be directly targeted unless they are directly participating in hostilities.\nEven with the existence of International Humanitarian Law (“IHL”) seeking to protect civilians during times of war, civilians\n\nstill experience loss. IHL exists with the purpose of protecting civilians during an ongoing armed conflict, but civilians can still be legally killed or injured. If done according to the Geneva Conventions’ rules of discrimination and proportionality, nations may still strike enemy targets that lead to the loss of limbs, lives, and loved ones for civilians. As examples, fighter jets can strike a weapons cache next to an apartment complex, a convoy can speed through a school playground, and combatants can return fire in a crowded street. Aside from a country’s stance on ethics in times of war, the plight of civilians has practical drawbacks, such as the hatred survivors have toward foreign governments and protests following civilian casualties. The United States military came to understand that it is important to win the hearts and minds of the civilian population in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Based on the implications that the United States was callously indifferent regarding civilian casualties, it started tracking the damage it caused and responded directly to affected families. The efforts by the U.S. government to recognize the importance of paying respect to the families of injured or killed civilians is another step toward protecting civilians during times of war.\nInternational Humanitarian Law provides the basis for the protection of civilians during an ongoing armed conflict, but does that translate from the physical world to the cyber world? The cyberspace domain offers capabilities that are far different from the physical domain. Cyberspace provides the cloak of anonymity that may shield civilians and even States from being identified as the responsible party for cyber operations. The protections afforded to civilians have been roughly translated from the physical to the cyber domain by the Tallinn Manual’s International Group of Experts as well as Guidance by the International Committee of the Red Cross.\n### III. The Current Treatment of Civilians in the Cyberspace\n *Id.*\n Sarah Holewinski, *Do Less Harm: Protecting and Compensating Civilians in War*, FOREIGN AFF., Jan.–Feb. 2013, at 14.\n *Id.*\n *Id.*\n *Id.*\n *Id.*\n\n[Vol. XLII\n## Domain\nCivilians enjoy very much the same protections in the cyberspace domain as they do in the physical domain. The Tallinn Manual states that civilians are defined in the cyberspace domain as they are under the Additional Protocol I of the Geneva Convention. Specifically, civilians are defined in terms of neither being members of armed forces nor members of a *levée en masse*. As such, individual civilians, as well as civilian populations, shall not be the object of a cyber-attack by a party to the armed conflict. A cyber-attack is any cyber operation or activity that is reasonably expected to cause injury or death to a person or the damage or destruction to objects. In addition, LOAC applies to the targeting of people or objects during an armed conflict regardless of the means or methods of warfare that are used. These seemingly broad definitions are key to protecting civilians during armed conflicts because parties to the conflict are held accountable for actions taken which are incompatible with the law of war.\n## A. Cyber Operations and the Law of Armed Conflict\nDefining cyber warfare, as a whole, is better understood by looking at its component parts. Cyberspace, in general, is the domain within the information environment made up of the interdependent network of information technology infrastructures and the resident data. Cyber warfare can be viewed as a combined concept of cyberspace operations, offensive cyberspace operations, and defensive cyberspace operations. Cyber operations are the employment of cyberspace capabilities where the primary purpose is to achieve objectives in and through\n TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE 104-05 (Michael N. Schmitt, ed. 2013) [hereinafter TALLINN MANUAL].\n *Id.*\n *Id.* at 113–14.\n *Id.* at 106–10.\n *Id.* at 104–05.\n *Cyber*, DICTIONARY OF MILITARY AND ASSOCIATED TERMS, U.S. DEP’T DEFENSE 57–58 (8 Nov. 2010 as amended through 15 Feb. 2016), http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/new_pubs/jp1_02.pdf [https://perma.cc/5UH8-B36A].\n *Id.*\n\ncyberspace. Offensive cyberspace operations are those intended to project power by the application of force in and through cyberspace.\nDefensive cyberspace operations are the passive and active cyberspace operations carried out to preserve the ability to use friendly cyberspace capabilities to protect data, networks, and other systems. Examples of cyber warfare include the gaining of access to a computer system to acquire control over it, transmission of viruses to destroy or alter data, use of logic bombs to sit idle in a system until a set time or occurrence, and insertion of a worm to reproduce until a system is overloaded. Understanding cyber warfare allows for a better understanding of how the LOAC principles are to be applied in the cyber domain.\nThe LOAC principles of proportionality, humanity, military necessity, and distinction apply to States operating in cyberspace in very much the same way as they apply in the physical domains. However, conducting operations in the cyber domain complicates the process because the operations are being carried out in an environment that is unreal and inherently unstable. Targeting for computer network attacks presents legal issues that are just as complex as physical attacks. Accordingly, States must exercise caution when planning and carrying out operations in cyberspace to ensure civilians are being protected. To do so, States conduct network reconnaissance for both operational requirements, as well as to ensure planned attacks do not cause collateral damage and casualties outside of what is acceptable under LOAC principles.\n Id.\n Id.\n Id.\n David Turns, *Cyber Warfare and the Notion of Direct Participation in Hostilities*, 17 J.

INT’L L. 391 (2010).\n Id.\n\n[Vol. XLII\nThere are some scholars and experts who view cyber operations as falling outside of the reach of the UN Charter or LOAC. Due to the UN Charter being written long before the advent of the Internet, the UN Charter was not written with a clear intention of including cyber operations. Scholars and experts adhering to this view believe the UN Charter encompasses only physical attacks, and cyber operations will almost certainly not involve the use of physical force. According to this line of thought, a country would not violate LOAC by deliberately launching cyber operations at civilian-owned targets. However, the Tallinn Manual examines cyber operations as falling under the UN Charter and being subject to LOAC.\nThe LOAC principle of distinction, as codified in Additional Protocol I, and incorporated into the Tallinn Manual, requires that parties to an armed conflict distinguish between the civilian population and combatants, as well as between civilian objects and military objectives. This requirement seeks to protect civilians and their property by holding the parties to armed conflict accountable for the targets they choose to attack. Further, the principle of distinction precludes any rationale or justification by a party for an attack not permitted by LOAC. In cases where there is doubt as to whether a person is a civilian in the cyber domain, that person shall be considered a civilian. This requirement complicates the cyber battlefield, because there are many civilians using computers and computer networks, and it may be very difficult to discern who is and is not a civilian.\nDetermining whether actors in the cyberspace domain are civilians, and may possibly be targeted when directly participating in hostilities during an international armed conflict, is difficult. Inaccurate attribution in cyberspace may leave vulnerable the civilians caught in the crossfire. The International Court of Justice maintains high standards for requisite attribution of an armed attack, and in the cyber domain, attribution for the act and actor\n See Cyber, supra note 57.\n Id.\n Id.\n See TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 52.\n Geneva Convention, supra note 2, art. 14; Geneva POW, supra note 34, art. 4.\n TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 52, at Rule 33.\n Id.\n\nare difficult to prove with scientific certainty. Further, this attribution on the Internet is “the most technologically challenging level of attribution,” because the attributing party is seeking “to determine the original individual or entity that is responsible for launching the attack.”\nIn the United States, the White House, State Department, and Department of Defense recognize the need to treat cyber operations as potentially falling under the UN Charter and requiring a LOAC determination prior to employment. Specifically, there is concern from these agencies that the use of cyber weapons could trigger unintended consequences and might harm diplomatic relations. Senior military officials have stated that attribution of cyber-attacks has remained a challenge, and that challenge factors into the difficulty of determining what constitutes a cyber act of war. Further, the National Security Director and U.S. Cyber Command chief has stated that the United States needs to think outside of the cyber realm regarding retaliation, and it needs to define acceptability limits regarding hacking. In addition, the United States needs to prepare a set of capabilities and show its determination for using them. Members of the U.S. Congress have echoed the need for cyber deterrence\n See Jason F.

The National Security Director and Cyber Command Chief has stated that anything the United States does in the cyber arena must follow LOAC, so cyber responses must be proportional and in line with historical norms. Further, cyberspace capabilities and operations parallel those in the physical domain, but cyber represents a different technical application in an attempt to achieve some of the exact same effects. Additionally, the development of cyber weapons represents the next evolutionary step in warfare, so it possesses all of the ethical concerns posed by similar weapons developed in the past. Therefore, the United States places great importance on maintaining compliance with LOAC even though cyber capabilities and operations were not planned for by the LOAC founders.\n## B. The Objects of Cyber Attacks\nThe Tallinn Manual also discusses who may be made the object of cyber-attacks and lists them as: 1) members of the armed forces; 2) members of organized armed groups; 3) civilians taking a direct part in hostilities; and 4) participants in a *levée en masse* during an international armed conflict. It should be noted that the first two categories can be made the object of an attack based on their status; however, the last two categories can only be made targets based on their actions. Members of organized armed\n *Id.*\n *Id.*\n Patrick Tucker, *NSA Chief: Rules of War Apply to Cyberwar*, Too, DEF. ONE (Apr. 20, 2015), http://cdn.defenseone.com/defenseone/interstitial.html?v=2.1.1&amp;rf=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.defenseone.com%2Ftechnology%2F2015%2F04%2Fnsa-chief-rules-war-apply-cyberwar-too%2F110572%2F [https://perma.cc/8RJM-ZLQT].\n *Id.*\n *Id.*\n *Id.*\n Geneva POW, *supra* note 34, art. 4.\n\ngroups are defined differently from different sources. The Tallinn Manual’s International Group of Experts were split over whether mere membership in such a group suffices or whether members would be required to show a continuous combat function. The continuous combat function is a requirement provided by the International Committee of the Red Cross in its guidance. This guidance requires the organized armed group to belong to a party to the conflict, demonstrated by conducting hostilities on behalf and with the agreement of the party. Further, members of the organized armed groups demonstrate their membership only by assuming continuous functions for the group, which involves direct participation in hostilities.\nThe second two categories of individuals who can be made the object of a cyber-attack are civilians who directly participate in hostilities, which will be addressed below, and participants in a levée en masse during an international armed conflict. Inhabitants of unoccupied territory during an international armed conflict who engage in cyber operations as part of a levée en masse are afforded combatant immunity and prisoner of war status. In addition, participants in a cyber-based levée en masse are targetable throughout the period of their participation therein. To be considered a levée en masse, the participating individuals must be inhabitants of non-occupied territory, who upon the invading enemy’s approach, take up arms to resist them. In the cyber context, “taking up arms” refers to engaging in cyber operations against the enemy.\nThis “taking up arms” in cyberspace is theoretical based on the facts that would have to exist for a cyber levée en masse to be\n *Id.*\n *Id.*\n Nils Melzer, *Interpretive Guidance on the Notion of Direct Participation Under International Humanitarian Law*, INT’L COMM. RED CROSS 1, 37 (2009), https://www.icrc.org/eng/assets/files/other/icrc-002-0990.pdf [https://perma.cc/N8G8-BMSB] (explaining particular difficulties relating to private contractors and civilian employees).\n *Id.* at Part I, 2, b.\n *Id.* at Part II, 1.\n TALLINN MANUAL, *supra* note 52, at Rule 27.\n *Id.* at Rule 34, comment 9.\n *Id.* at Rule 27.\n *Id.*\n\n[Vol. XLII]\nlawfully carried out. In the physical world, the levée en masse occurs when the enemy invades, and the inhabitants take on arms to defend themselves without being organized. However, this levée en masse is still required to carry arms openly and respect the laws and customs of war, though they are not required to wear identifying attire. In the cyber domain, a levée en masse could occur if, in response to a physical invasion, members of the population spontaneously mount cyber operations against the invaders. Further, the International Group of Experts are divided as to whether levée en masse privileges can apply to a civilian population engaged in countering a massive cyber-attack in lieu of a physical invasion.\nIn general, civilians should be protected in the cyberspace domain in much the same way as they are protected in the physical domains. The difference is the virtually untested nature of the cyberspace domain. It remains unclear exactly how States are to behave in cyberspace, what rises to the level of a cyber-attack, and what level of physical domain response is authorized for a particular cyber-attack. These and other unresolved translations from the physical realm to the cyber domain make difficult the protection of civilians during an international armed conflict. A step further would be the impact on civilians when they decide to directly participate in cyber hostilities.\n## IV. Civilians Directly Participating in Hostilities in the Cyberspace Domain\nThe Tallinn Manual provides that, based on LOAC principles, there is no bar of any category of person from participating in cyber operations, whether during an international or non-international armed conflict. However, civilians participating in an armed conflict through cyber operations would likely not be entitled to prisoner of war status and combatant immunity, and they could be targeted based on their participation. The\n *Id.*\n Geneva POW, *supra* note 34, art. 4.\n *Id.*\n *Id.*\n *Id.*\n TALLINN MANUAL, *supra* note 52, at Rule 25.\n *Id.* at Rule 25, comment 2.\n\nentitlement to combatant immunity and prisoner of war status are dependent upon the individual being engaged in an international armed conflict, as opposed to solely a non-international armed conflict or actions not rising to the level of armed conflict. Even if civilians participate in hostilities, the majority of the International Group of Experts agree that civilians retain their civilian status. However, civilians remain subject to prosecution under the applicable domestic laws of the States capturing them.\n## A. Defining Direct Participation in Hostilities\nAs previously mentioned, civilians can be made the object of cyber-attacks if they are directly taking part in hostilities. Though civilians are protected from attack during international armed conflicts, they lose that protection if and for so long as they directly participate in hostilities. This protection from attack and subsequent loss of protection only applies to civilians; it does not apply to members of armed forces, organized armed groups, or participants in a *levée en masse*. Further, members of groups failing to qualify as organized armed groups would also qualify as civilians under this rule. For example, a group would fail to be recognized as an organized armed group if they lack the required level of organization or if they fail to maintain a continuous combat function.\nConducting operations in cyberspace that may rise to the level of direct participation in hostilities can be better understood by looking at the functions or tasks carried out in the cyber domain. Those involved in cyber operations seemingly fall in to three main categories according to their functions: 1) those who design or write the programs used for offense or defensive cyber operations; 2) those who install these programs on computer systems, act as service administrators, and provide technical maintenance; and 3)\n *Id.* at Rule 25.\n *Id.* at Rule 29.\n *Id.* at Rule 29.\n *Id.* at Rules 32, 35.\n Geneva POW, *supra* note 34, art. 4; TALLINN MANUAL, *supra* note 52, at Rule 35.\n *Id.*\n *Id.* art. 4; Melzer, *supra* note 90, at Part I.2.b.\n\n[Vol. XLII\nthose who actually operate the computer programs. A lone civilian could presumably be filling all of these roles in a solo operation.\nWhen civilians directly participate in hostilities through cyber operations during an international armed conflict, they are liable to be attacked either through cyber means or other lawful means under LOAC. IHL does not define direct participation in hostilities, so direct participation must be interpreted in good faith according to the ordinary meaning and the context based on the object and purpose of IHL. Treaty law in this area refers to hostilities in terms of international or non-international armed conflict, so that should be the threshold; hostilities cannot refer to internal disturbances, riots, or isolated and sporadic events. Not all conduct during an armed conflict constitutes part of hostilities. Civilian participation in hostilities can occur in various forms and intensity levels in a wide variety of geographical, cultural, political, and military contexts, so the circumstances at the relevant time and place of the hostilities should be examined.\nThe direct participation in hostilities refers to specific acts, which are carried out by individuals as part of the hostilities between two parties in an armed conflict. There are therefore two elements: 1) direct participation; and 2) hostilities. Participation in hostilities can either be direct or indirect; direct participation is the engagement in specific hostile acts. The concept of hostilities is best described as the aggregate of all hostile acts carried out by all individuals, either armed forces, organized armed groups, or civilians, during an armed conflict.\nThe specific acts carried out by civilians qualify as direct participation in hostilities if they meet all of the following criteria:\n Cyber, supra note 57.\n Geneva POW, supra note 34, art. 4; TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 52, at Rule 35.\n Melzer, supra note 90, at Part II.B.\n Id.\n Id.\n Id.\n Id. at Part VI.\n Id.\n Melzer, supra note 90, at Part VI.\n\n1) the act is likely to adversely affect the military operations or capacity of a party to an armed conflict or inflict death, injury, or destruction on persons or objects protected against direct attack, which is the threshold of harm; 2) there must be a direct causal link between the act and harm that is likely to occur from the act; and 3) the act must be specifically designed to directly cause the required threshold of harm in support of a party to the armed conflict. The threshold of harm is based on likely harm and does not require the act to materialize into the expected level of harm. Additionally, the act does not have to be an actual attack against troops or military objects; it also includes acts of sabotage as well as disturbing deployments and communications.\nIn addition to meeting the threshold of harm, the second criterion requires there also be a direct causal link between the act and the harm. For there to be direct causation, there must be a sufficiently close causal relationship between the act and the resulting harm. Specifically, direct causation should be brought about in one causal step. Individual actions that can be viewed as merely supporting one side to an armed conflict or that only build up or maintain the capacity of a party is excluded from the concept of direct participation in hostilities. For example, providing supplies for a party or financing the actions of a party to an armed conflict would bring about a result, but there is not direct causation for the potential harm. Other examples of indirect participation would be scientific research and design, recruitment and the training of personnel, and the production or transportation of weapons or equipment.\nThe third criterion requires there be a belligerent nexus, which is that an act must be specifically designed to directly cause the required threshold of harm in support of a party to the armed conflict. Accordingly, the act must be objectively likely to inflict harm, and it must be specifically designed to do so in\n *Id.* at Part V.\n *Id.*\n *Id.*\n *Id.* at Part V.2.b.\n *Id.* at Part V.2.f.\n Melzer, *supra* note 90, at Part V.\n *Id.* at Part V.2.b.\n *Id.* at Part V.3.\n\n[Vol. XLII]\nsupport of a party to the armed conflict. Therefore, violence that is not designed to harm a party to an armed conflict cannot amount to direct participation in hostilities. This type of violence is left solely to domestic law enforcement measures and not LOAC or IHL. The belligerent nexus requirement is important, because there are many activities during armed conflict that cause a considerable level of harm but fall short of direct participation in hostilities. This is exemplified by violent crimes committed for reasons unrelated to the conflict, such as robberies or murders, as well as the theft of military equipment for private use or sale. Also requiring special attention is use of individual self-defense or defense of others. If a civilian uses force to protect his property from looting, he is not doing so with a belligerent nexus. Instead, he is acting out of self-defense.\nUnderstanding whether hostilities by civilians during armed conflict rise to the level of direct participation is not enough. The defining moment of when the direct participation in hostilities begins and ends is also important. Preparatory measures leading up to the execution of the specific act, and the movement to and from the location of the execution, all constitute integral parts of the act. Accordingly, IHL concerns itself with more than just exactly when the act took place; it looks at the totality of the circumstances surrounding the civilian’s direct participation in hostilities. This is a significant point, because civilians lose their protection against direct attacks for such time as they directly participate in hostilities.\nPreparatory measures are those that IHL would describe as military operations in preparation for an attack and which are so closely linked to the execution of the specific act that they constitute an integral part of the act. Even so, there is no requirement that the preparatory measures occur immediately prior to the specific act or even in close geographic proximity to the\n\nplace of the specific act. An example in the physical domain would be a civilian who builds a bomb in his garage, which he intends to place in the road in order to blow it up and injure armed forces during an international armed conflict. In this illustration, the preparatory measures taken by the civilian bomb maker in his garage, as well as the transit to and from the place where he plants the bomb, would all be considered part of the direct participation in hostilities. Thus, the bomb maker could be targeted at any point from when he starts building the bomb in his garage until he returns home from planting it. Also included in general preparatory measures would be the transporting of personnel, gathering of intelligence, and equipping and instructing armed forces. Where the execution of a hostile act does not require deployment, such as hostilities in cyberspace, the duration of the act should be limited to the immediate execution of the act.\n## B. Tallinn Manual View of Direct Participation in Hostilities\nThe Tallinn Manual’s International Group of Experts generally agrees with the three cumulative criteria for qualification as a direct participation in hostilities as applied to cyberspace. First, there must be a threshold of harm, wherein the civilian has the intended or actual effect of negatively affecting the military operations or capabilities of a party to an armed conflict or inflicting death, physical harm, or material destruction on persons or objects protected against direct attack. Physical damage to objects or harm to individuals is not required, so long as the cyber act negatively affects the party militarily. Second, there must be a direct causal link between the act and the harm intended. An example would be a civilian conducting cyber acts against an armed force in international armed conflict, wherein the civilian disrupts the command and control, even temporarily, for the armed force. Finally, there must be a belligerent nexus established by the\n *Id.*\n *Id.*\n Melzer, *supra* note 90, at Part VI.\n TALLINN MANUAL, *supra* note 52, at Rule 35, comment 4.\n *Id.*\n *Id.*\n *Id.*\n\n[Vol. XLII\nact directly relating to the hostilities.\nIn cyberspace, direct participation in hostilities by civilians may be more difficult to delineate. Determining whether a civilian directly participated in conventional hostilities is complex by itself; making the same determination in cyber-hostilities is especially so. Civilians conducting cyber-attacks related to an armed conflict would qualify as an act of direct participation in hostilities. A cyber-attack is defined as a cyber operation that is reasonably expected to cause injury or death to persons or damage or destruction to objects. Accordingly, civilians conducting cyber-attacks in this way would meet the three criteria for directly participating in hostilities. Other examples of direct participation include civilians conducting cyber operations with the intent to identify vulnerabilities in a targeted computer network or system, or civilians designing malware to take advantage of vulnerabilities in the systems of a party to an armed conflict. Further examples in the cyber domain include civilians using cyber means to gather information on enemy operations and passing that information to the other armed force in the conflict as well as conducting distributed denial of service operations against military systems.\nOn the other hand, not all cyber operations by civilians would rise to the level of direct participation in hostilities. For example, designing malware for a specific purpose and making it available online, even if it is actually used by someone else to conduct an attack during an armed conflict, would not be considered direct participation. What would be lacking would be the threshold of harm in the first criterion; the malware creator never had the intended or actual effect of negatively affecting military operations or capabilities. Another example would be civilians simply maintaining computer equipment generally, even if that equipment were eventually used in hostilities. Again, what would be\n *Id.*\n Emily Crawford, *Virtual Battlegrounds: Direct Participation in Cyber Warfare*, 9 J. L. &amp; POL’Y INFO. SOC’Y 1 (2013).\n TALLINN MANUAL, *supra* note 52, at Rule 35, comment 5.\n *Id.* at Rule 30.\n *Id.* at Rule 35, comment 5.\n *Id.*\n *Id.*\n *Id.*\n\nmissing is the threshold of harm at the first criterion.\nThe first criterion of the threshold of harm would also disqualify other cyber operations taken during an armed conflict. Cyber operations during an armed conflict that are taken for purely criminal or private reasons would not qualify as direct participation in hostilities. As an example, a criminal using cyber means to steal funds from a party to a conflict for purely personal gain, and not to negatively affect the party, would not be directly participating in hostilities. What is difficult about this example is that the party to the armed conflict would have to determine the intent of the civilian actor, which could be disguised as purely personal and criminal when it could in fact be aimed at adversely affecting the party to the conflict. Taken a step further, if the individual stole the money from the party in order to finance particular military operations, the operation to steal the money would be considered a direct participation in hostilities.\nPreparatory measures in cyberspace differ from those taken in the physical domain. Because civilians can be directly targeted for the duration of time during which they are directly participating in hostilities, it is important for parties to an armed conflict to understand the timeframe of direct participation. The actions taken in cyberspace immediately preceding or subsequent to a qualifying act of direct participation are included in the preparatory measures. As an example, a civilian travelling to and from the location of the computer he uses to mount a cyber operation would be included in the preparatory measures, and the civilian could be directly targeted in transit. The time for preparatory measures may even extend as far backward and forward in time as the causal link to the action exists. For example, in a cyber operation this would include the time when the civilian first starts to explore the vulnerabilities of the system of a party to an armed conflict, the time the individual creates the cyber tool to exploit the vulnerabilities, the period of time the civilian attacks the system, and through to the time the individual assesses\n TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 52, at Rule 35, comment 6.\n Id.\n Id.\n Id. at Rule 35, comment 7.\n Id.\n Id.\n\n[Vol. XLII\nthe damage to the system.\nIn addition to the preparatory measures taken for a cyber operation, parties to an armed conflict must take into account the delayed effects of direct participation in hostilities by civilians. The actions taken by civilians in the cyber domain have some parallels to the physical domain, but they also vary widely. The emplacement of a logic bomb, which is designed to activate at some point in the future upon either a command or after a predetermined period of time, is an example. The majority of the Tallinn Manual’s International Group of Experts takes the position that the time frame for which the civilian is directly participating, and can thus be targeted, is from the beginning of his involvement in mission planning until the individual terminates his active role in the operation. It is important to point out that the end of the period of direct participation may not sync up with the point when the damage occurs. For example, the first civilian may have created and emplaced the logic bomb, which is awaiting a command prompt to activate it. A second civilian may be the one to actually command the bomb to activate. In this example, the first civilian could have halted his period of direct participation and would no longer be directly targetable when the damage actually occurs. Thus, the key is for parties to determine when individuals are targetable based on when their participation begins and ends.\n## C. Determination of Direct Participation in Hostilities Complicated by Cyberspace-Specific Issues\nThe delayed effects of cyber operations complicate the accurate determination of precisely when a civilian is directly participating in cyber hostilities. The majority of the International Group of Experts takes the position that a civilian is directly participating in hostilities from the beginning of his involvement through the point in time where the civilian terminates an active role in the operation. The problem with this majority view is that it does not make clear to the participating civilian or to the\n TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 52, at Rule 35, comment 8.\n Id.\n Id.\n Id.\n Id. at Rule 35, comment 6.\n\nState being attacked the window of time during which the civilian may be directly and legally targeted. The civilian may terminate an active role by no longer checking the status of the ongoing cyber operation, but the State may still attribute the operation to the civilian and target him. The State may not discover the ongoing cyber operation until after the civilian has terminated an active role, but the State has no way of knowing the civilian has terminated his active role in the ongoing cyber operation.\nThe logic bomb example parallels civilian operations in the physical world. Coalition Forces fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan faced road-side improvised explosive devices (“IEDs”), which were responsible for causing death and injury to troops as well as damage to military objects. If a civilian was responsible for building, transporting, emplacing, and setting off the IED, the civilian could be targeted throughout the entire process. The beginning and end of the civilian’s direct participation in hostilities could be measured from the time he began sourcing parts for the bomb until the time he set off the IED and transited back from the bombsite. Similarly, the civilian responsible for the logic bomb in the aforementioned example could be targeted from the time he began creating the logic bomb until he commands the logic bomb to activate. However, technology in the cyber domain varies widely from technology in the physical domain.\nIn the cyber domain, individuals can create programs capable of running autonomously or semi-autonomously. A computer network attack (“CAN”) is defined as either a cyber, electronic, or physical attack against an information technology facility or against computer equipment. Most of these CNAs are carried out by cyber operations, which use malicious code to infect enemy computers in order to exploit weaknesses in software, system configuration, or computer security practices. Cyber operations also include the use of bots, or remotely, or semi-autonomously controlled programs infecting computers, as well as botnets, which perform espionage by transmitting data between themselves while\n *Id.* at Rule 35, comment 4 (providing that there is well-known, ongoing debate as to whether the assembly of an IED qualifies as direct participation in hostilities).\n See generally CLAY WILSON, COMPUTER ATTACK AND CYBERTERRORISM 3-11 (2009) (providing insight on different types of attacks against computers).\n *Id.*\n\n[Vol. XLII\nawaiting the final activation signal from the operator. Malicious programs, such as spyware and malware, attack by disrupting normal computer functions or by opening a back door for a remote operator to take control of the computer. Cyber operators have designed computer exploits which launch anonymously from thousands of infected computers and which produce waves of disruption to overwhelm the target of the operation. The technology allowing autonomous and semi-autonomous operations in cyberspace makes difficult the task of determining the beginning and ending points of direct participation by civilians.\nA minority of the Tallinn Manual Group of Experts would break down the various steps in cyber operations such as the emplacement of the logic bomb and its activation as separate acts of direct participation. Under this view, the civilian would only directly participate in hostilities in intermittent instances when he is actively engaged in hostilities. This view provides greater protection to civilians, as they are shielded from directly being targeted except for the times when they are actively engaged in cyber operations. However, this view would make it very difficult for the parties engaged in armed conflict to accurately determine when civilians are directly participating and then target the civilians participating in hostilities at precisely those times. The Group of Experts is split regarding repeated cyber operations. One view is in line with the ICRC in that each cyber act must be treated separately in terms of direct participation analysis. On the other hand, another view is that it would make more operational sense if direct participation begins with the first cyber operation and continues throughout the period of intermittent activity. The latter view removes the “revolving door” effect and simplifies target ability by making the intermittent activity a singular, start-to-finish cyber operation.\n\nThe Tallinn Experts were also divided over the issue of presumption against direct participation. Recall that the Tallinn Manual provides that in cases where there is doubt as to whether an individual is a civilian, that individual should be treated like a civilian. The policy behind this principle is to ensure that civilians are protected to the utmost extent during armed conflicts. Some Tallinn Experts take this same line of thinking regarding civilians believed to be directly participating in hostilities. These experts believe civilians in this predicament should be given the benefit of the doubt.\nHowever, other Tallinn Experts take the position that when there is doubt as to whether a civilian is directly participating in hostilities, the attacking state must review the relevant information available and act reasonably in the circumstances in determining whether to conduct the attack. The policy behind this method rests in the attacking state’s ability to identify which targets are legal targets based on a reasonable review of the available information. The importance of these two views cannot be understated. Some experts side with protecting civilians to the maximum extent possible, while others favor the States’ ability to act while following LOAC principles.\nAlthough the Tallinn Manual agrees with ICRC Guidance’s requirements of a threshold of harm—a causal link between the action and the harm and a belligerent nexus—generally, the Tallinn Manual’s application of the ICRC’s guidance is a variation of the ICRC’s direct participation in hostilities legal regime involving cyber actions. The Tallinn manual does not have a requirement for physical damage to objects, so actions that may not qualify as cyber-attacks may still satisfy the criterion for the threshold of harm if the action has negatively affected the targeted State. Specifically, the Tallinn Manual provides that a civilian’s\n Id. at Rule 35, comment 12.\n TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 52, at Rule 33.\n Id. at Rule 35, comment 12.\n Id.\n Id.\n See Collin Allan, Direct Participation in Hostilities from Cyberspace, 50 VA.

Furthermore, the majority of Tallinn experts agreed that interfering with an object’s functionality would rise to the level of destruction if a physical component must be replaced. Thus, the Tallinn view of the first-prong requirement of the threshold of harm may be seen as lowering the standard for what is required for civilians to be directly participating in hostilities.\nThe Tallinn Manual’s view of the second prong, which is the causal link between the act and the harm likely to result, also differs slightly from the ICRC Guidance. In particular, the Tallinn Manual focuses on the intended harm. By focusing on the intended harm, the Tallinn Manual may be lowering the standard of what is required for a civilian to participate in hostilities by looking at the civilian’s intent, rather than focusing on the likelihood of harm from the cyber operation. For example, a civilian may be directly targeted under the Tallinn Manual view for his role in assembling and storing the cyber equivalent of an IED because the individual intends the same harm as the person arming and detonating it. By comparing the Tallinn Manual’s view with the ICRC Guidance, it is possible that the Tallinn Manual lowers the standards for what is required for civilians to be directly participating in cyber hostilities. Therefore, civilians participating in hostilities through cyber means may be targetable in more situations than under the ICRC framework.\n## V.

That is, they are defined as neither members of the armed forces, which includes groups assimilated to the armed forces such as organized armed groups, nor those participating in a levée en masse. Essentially, all others are considered civilians. Private contractors and employees of a party to an armed conflict who fit the definition of civilians are entitled to protection from being directly targeted, unless they are directly participating in hostilities. In addition, private contractors and civilian employees are not entitled to combatant immunity, as they are not members of the armed force. The activities carried out by contractors and employees as well as their location of duty may expose them to an increased risk of death or injury even if they are not directly participating in hostilities.\n## A. State-Affiliated Civilians\nModern warfare is increasingly dependent upon private contractors and civilian employees to fill a variety of positions traditionally held by military personnel. Generally, these private contractors and civilian employees are considered civilians under the same criteria that would apply to other civilians. That is, they cannot be directly targeted by a party to the armed conflict unless and for so long as they directly participate in hostilities. Due to the special roles of private contractors and civilian employees and their proximity to armed forces in hostilities, parties to an armed conflict must make determinations regarding attacks with particular care and due consideration.\nThe majority of private contractors and civilian employees have been incorporated into State armed forces, but they do not\n---\n See generally TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 52, Rule 29 (quoting the Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 Aug. 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts art. 50, § 1, June 8, 1977, 1125 U.N.T.S. 3).\n Melzer, supra note 90.\n Id. at 38.\n Id. at 37.\n Id.\n Id.\n Id.\n\n[Vol. XLII\nperform functions that would have them directly participate in hostilities. Nevertheless, there are some contractor and civilians filling roles that would put them in situations where they could be seen as directly participating in hostilities. For example, private contractors and civilian employees that defend the base from attack could either be directly participating in hostilities or filling a law enforcement and defense-of-others role.\nEven if they have accompanied armed forces, private contractors and civilians were never meant to (and should never be allowed to) directly participate in hostilities on behalf of a party to a conflict. As long as they are not incorporated into armed forces, private contractors and civilian employees do not cease to be civilians, and they do not lose their civilian protection simply because they accompany armed forces. Moreover, they do not lose their civilian protection just because they assume functions other than conducting hostilities, which traditionally would have been performed by members of armed forces. Contractors and civilian employees who directly participate in hostilities without the express authorization of the party to the armed conflict remain civilians, but they lose their protection from being directly targeted. Contractors and employees can lose their civilian status if they have been incorporated into the armed forces of a party to a conflict. If this happens, the contractors and employees would become members of an organized armed force under the command responsible for the party to the conflict and would no longer qualify as civilians.\n---\n See Melzer, *supra* note 90, at 37 (explaining the basic notion of direct participation in hostilities).\n See *id.* at 44 (illustrating that “[t]he notion of direct participation in hostilities does not refer to a person’s status, function, or affiliation, but to his or her engagement in specific hostile acts”).\n *Id.* at 38.\n *Id.*\n *Id.*\n *Id.*\n See Melzer, *supra* note 90, at 39 (explaining that “[a]s long as they are not incorporated into the armed forces, private contractors and civilian employees do not cease to be civilians simply because they accompany the armed forces and or assume functions other than the conduct of hostilities that would traditionally have been performed by military personnel”).\n *Id.*\n\nThe Tallinn Manual’s international group of experts concurs that individual contractors and civilians may only be directly targeted based on their direct participation in hostilities during an armed conflict. However, there are issues that arise in cyberspace regarding the use of contractors and civilians to perform specific military operations. Unlike traditional warfare, where almost all military operations were carried out by troops and equipment, modern warfare introduces the use of cyber capabilities which conduct a portion of the military operations. An example is the hiring of a private company by a party to an armed conflict that is later contracted to perform specific military operations. Based on the military operations, the company would qualify as an organized armed group belonging to the party to the conflict. Therefore, the civilians employed as private contractors would be considered belonging to the organized armed group. However, even if the civilians were not to be considered as belonging to the organized armed group, they would still only be directly targetable when and if they are directly participating in hostilities.\nCivilian government employees are also employed in positions requiring them to conduct cyber operations during an armed conflict, such as positions within an intelligence agency. If the group of civilians conducting cyber operations qualifies as an organized armed group, the civilian members are subject to attack regardless of direct participation in hostilities. Otherwise, the civilian employees are only directly targetable when they are directly participating in hostilities. As a result, the historic view of citizens carrying out actions typically performed by members of armed forces may be problematic when analyzing the cyber domain construct. The traditional view of warfare holds that private contractors and civilian employees operating in an organized armed group, affiliated with armed forces in an armed conflict, would not be entitled to combatant status.\n\n[Vol. XLII]\nFurthermore, a party to the armed conflict employing civilians to perform intelligence functions, attack execution, or other CNA operations would violate the law of war. The reasoning behind this view is that only members of armed forces or assimilated organizations are granted combatant status because they meet the following conditions: (i) they are commanded by a person responsible for his subordinates; (ii) they have a fixed distinctive emblem recognizable at distance; (iii) they carry arms openly; and (iv) they conduct their operation in accordance with the laws and customs of war. Accordingly, under the traditional view, parties to an armed conflict should employ members of the armed force to carry out CNA functions, and if they desire contractors or civilian employees to fill these roles, then the parties should incorporate them into the regular armed forces.\nDue to the vastly different landscape and operations carried out in cyberspace as opposed to the physical domain, a suggested course of action would be to rely less on the aforementioned four conditions and instead look to state affiliation. The four criteria from the 1874 Brussels Declaration apply perfectly to traditional warfare, but operations in cyberspace are conducted without the need of having a fixed recognizable emblem or of carrying arms openly. By requiring state affiliation for civilian employees, it preserves concern for the principle of distinction in CNA from the Brussels criteria. States employing civilians to conduct cyber operations are less likely to be doing so to prevent the enemy from attacking the civilians. Instead, States are likely taking advantage of the economic, training, and recruiting advantages that develop as a result of not being limited to armed forces filling these behind-the-lines roles. The fact that cyber operations take\nON CYBER CONFLICT, 235, 242 (2012), https://ccdcoe.org/cycon/2012/proceedings/d2r1s10_watts.pdf [https://perma.cc/X6F2-TTRP] [hereinafter Notion of Combatancy].\n Id.\n See id. at 245 (citing the Project of an International Declaration Concerning the Laws and Customs of War, Aug. 27, 1874, 4 Martens Nouveau Recueil (ser. 2) 219 (“1874 Brussels Declaration”)).\n Id.\n Id.\n Id.\n See Notion of Combatancy, supra note 210, at 246.\n Id.\n\nplace far from the battlefield also bolsters the position of state affiliation, because there is no concern that the enemy will be confused regarding distinction in targeting.\nUnder the state affiliation view of civilians taking part in cyber operations, discipline in warfare will continue to be preserved as it is under the four Brussels criteria. Currently, civilians directly participating in hostilities are not subject to the internal military disciplinary system. However, the well-developed legal regimes that prosecute and punish war crimes operate in a manner to vindicate concerns for discipline and humanity. In addition to international enforcement bodies, domestic criminal codes now serve as mechanisms where civilians are equally susceptible to prosecution for any war crimes they have committed. Under the state-affiliation view, States will be able to employ civilians to conduct cyber operations while enabling combatant status. States will also be able to maintain the critically important notions of distinction and discipline as provided under the four Brussels criteria.\nStates employing private contractors and civilian employees do so because of the different landscape and types of operations carried out in cyberspace. As they are written and observed, current LOAC principles, ICRC guidance, and the Tallinn Manual hold that civilians operating in cyberspace in a way that directly participates in hostilities are subject to directly being targeted but are not given combatant immunity. The view of letting state-affiliation drive combatant status determinations for cyberspace operations provides civilians with combatant status, or a version of it, while parties to an armed conflict can still conduct warfare and be no worse off. Currently, parties to an armed conflict operating in cyberspace are left with the difficult task of making determinations regarding direct participation in hostilities by civilians operating anonymously. The state-affiliation view would, at the least, put civilians on notice of what their consequences of participation entail, as well as protect them by\n\n[Vol. XLII]\ngiving them some version of combatant immunity for their actions in armed conflict.\nA comparison of state-affiliated actors versus non-state-affiliated actors may lead to different statuses for each. When viewed as either contractors, who are working on behalf of a State engaged in an international armed conflict, or hacktivists, who operate outside of the control of the State but engage in cyber operations in favor of the State, the statuses of each may be seen as divergent. While neither of the two would qualify for combatant immunity, based on the four requirements provided by the Third Geneva Convention, contractors would have the best shot at being entitled prisoner-of-war (“POW”) status. Due to the nature of their service, contractors accompanying an armed force likely carry identification cards associating them with the armed force. Accordingly, contractors would not be given combatant status, but they would be more likely than hacktivists to be given POW status.\nCivilians accompanying armed forces are afforded some protection, but that protection comes with the inherent danger of accompanying armed forces. State-affiliated civilians qualifying for the narrow category of “civilians accompanying the armed forces” could be eligible for POW status while at the same time also be legitimate military targets for the enemy State. These civilians would likely be performing duties in the functional category of operating and maintaining the cyber operations systems. The civilians filling this state-affiliated role would\n See Logan Liles, *The Civilian Cyber Battlefield: Non-State Cyber Operators’ Status Under the Law of Armed Conflict*, 39 N.C. J.

Their role and location make them possible military targets as well as collateral damage for the enemy State attacking the armed force.\nAnother area of civilian participation in the cyber domain, which remains unresolved, is the participation by civilian scientists specializing in cyberspace. The majority of the participation by a state-affiliated civilian cyber scientist would be viewed as indirect participation. However, there are possible situations where a civilian’s particular expertise could have an exceptional and potentially decisive value for the outcome of an armed conflict. An example would be a computer programmer who researches and writes attack programs, one of which is used to incapacitate the enemy’s network controlling the launch of weapons systems. In this example, the civilian scientist could be responsible for the turning point in the conflict, thus shifting his participation from indirect to direct. The importance of this example is that the State hosting the state-affiliated civilian and the civilian need to understand the possible implications of having the scientist participate, directly or indirectly, in hostilities. Further, the enemy State is going to have to make a call as to whether it can directly target the civilian scientist or attack the military target and consider the scientist collateral damage.\n## B. Non-State-Affiliated Civilians\nNon-state-affiliated civilians, also known as patriotic hackers or hacktivists, are the civilians directly participating in hostilities armed forces’ (presumably those who operate and maintain those systems)—even if they do not actually press the button that launches a cyberattack—are both eligible for prisoner-of-war status and also legitimate military targets for the enemy”).\n *Id.*\n *See id.* at 291–92 (stating that “there is a high probability that many, if not most, of the personnel substantively involved in cyber operations may actually be civilians”).\n *See id.* at 292 (discussing that “[c]omputer technicians, technical maintenance personnel and others who perform similar tasks . . . could thus qualify for inclusion in the limited category of ‘persons who accompany the armed forces without actually being members thereof’”).\n *See id.* at 291 (distinguishing computer programmers who research and write attack programs from operators who execute cyber attacks).\n Turns, *supra* note 62, at 291.\n\n[Vol. XLII]\non their own volition, so they will likely receive no protection under LOAC. These hackers carry out cyber operations against perceived enemy computer systems, without the control or oversight from their government but seek common political ends. Hacktivists would seem to receive no protection due to their direct participation in hostilities; however, hacktivists could arguably be considered participants in a *levée en masse* if they took up arms spontaneously upon the enemy approaching, lack organization, and carried arms openly. If so, hacktivists would be entitled to POW status, but they could be directly targeted while directly participating in hostilities. The LOAC principles have not been updated for cyber operations, so it is difficult to play out exactly how non-state-affiliated civilians are to be treated during international armed conflicts. Ideally, IHL would be universally understood by states engaged in armed conflict and the non-state-affiliated civilians who choose to directly participate in cyber hostilities would be on notice as to how their actions will be measured.\nAlso, made difficult by the landscape and types of operations carried out in cyberspace is the direct targeting of those individuals directly participating. Aside from anonymity being a difficult hurdle in cyberspace, the determination as to whether a physical attack is justified in response to a cyber action is still theoretical. Furthermore, neither treaties nor customary international law have established the illegality of espionage, either in the physical world or in cyberspace. Thus, civilians conducting CNAs on behalf of a State which is party to an armed conflict may not be directly participating in hostilities. Further, customary international law has not recognized data manipulation and deletions as rising to the level of hostilities, so civilians conducting these types of CNAs would not be directly participating in hostilities.\n## VI. Suggested Treatment For Non-State-Affiliated Civilians\n *Id.* at 293.\n *See id.* (explaining that hacktivists could arguably be assimilated to the rarely used category of *levée en masse*, in which case they would be entitled to POW status if captured, and could also be subject to attack while acting as such a body; [i]n order to meet the legal conditions of a *levée en masse* they would have to “take up arms” spontaneously “on the approach of the enemy”).\n *See id.* (explaining the difficulty of applying the criteria necessary to meet the legal conditions of a *levée en masse* in a cyber-conflict).\n\n# Directly Participating In Cyber Hostilities\nThe principles of LOAC, as they currently exist, govern actions taken in cyberspace as if they occur in the more traditional, physical domain. A major concern with this LOAC application is the effect it has on civilians. As the law of war has evolved, the protection of civilians has been one of the key tenets from the outset. The Fourth Geneva Convention sought to protect civilian persons taking no part in hostilities as well as the wounded and sick. The Convention also prohibited an occupying power from destroying real and personal property belonging to civilians. The Additional Protocol I of the Geneva Convention calls for the protection of civilians from unnecessary injury or death and obliges combatants to distinguish themselves from the civilian population while engaged in an attack. The civilian population is specifically protected under Part IV, which demands the parties to at all times distinguish between civilian population and combatants as well as between civilian objects and military objectives. Further, Protocol I prohibits parties from making the civilian population the object of an attack, which also prohibits acts or threats having the intent to terrorize the civilian population.\nThe protections provided by LOAC are two-fold. On one hand, they are meant to inform parties to an armed conflict regarding how to conduct themselves while at war. On the other hand, LOAC provides notice to civilians affected by armed conflict as to the treatment they can expect from the parties to the conflict. The relative nuance of cyberspace operations, as compared to traditional warfare, makes difficult the determination of direct participation in hostilities by citizens. If LOAC principles are incapable of adequately putting parties to armed conflict and citizens on notice, it should be amended for this purpose.\n Geneva Convention, supra note 2, art. 15.\n Id.\n Id. art. 44.\n Protocol I, supra note 1, art. 48.\n Id. art. 51.\n\n[Vol. XLII\n## A. Temporal Considerations in the Cyber Domain\nDirect participation in hostilities by civilians operating in the cyber domain is vastly different than participation in the physical domain due to temporal considerations. Actions taken in cyberspace are not easily detected as they are happening, and they are often created for use in the future. For example, computer network attacks involve the use of malicious code to either infect an enemy’s computer system or to exploit weaknesses in the software, system configuration, or security practices. Additionally, bots and even botnets are remotely-controlled or semi-autonomous computer programs that infect computers and systems to transmit data obtained by the system or instruct the system to operate a certain way. Hackers have even designed ways to exploit computers and systems in a way to launch programs anonymously and autonomously from thousands of infected computers. Accordingly, cyber operations differ greatly from physical operations due to the timing of how the operations are carried out. Cyber operations can be set to take place at a certain time in the future or after a certain event has occurred.\nThe ICRC Guidance and the Tallinn Manual both touch on these temporal considerations. The ICRC provides that preparatory acts can be treated as separate acts and distinguished from the act that is the object of the direct participation in hostilities. Therefore, a civilian participating in hostilities may\n See WILSON, supra note 163, at 39 (explaining the characteristics of malicious code).\n Id. at 38 (explaining that “[a]utomated programs, or ‘bots’ . . . are increasingly autonomous, rapid, and difficult to detect . . . [and] can be remotely controlled by commands sent through the Internet and can be activated to operate in a coordinated manner on thousands of computers in different locations around the world”); see id. at 41 (explaining that “[s]ome compromised computers become part of an automatic ‘bot network,’ quietly performing espionage by transmitting data or intermediate preparatory instructions back and forth between compromised computers while awaiting a special final activation signal originating from the attacker”).\n See id. at 43 (explaining that “hackers have also designed recent computer exploits that launch anonymously from thousands of infected computers to produce waves of disruption that can quickly overwhelm a targeted organization, or multiple organizations such as a list of banking institutions”).\n See Melzer, supra note 90, at 68 (stating that “[w]here the execution of a hostile act does not require geographic displacement, as may be the case with computer network attacks or remote-controlled weapons systems, the duration of direct participation in\n\nconduct a series of acts, each directly participating in hostilities, over a period of time that lead up to the object of the direct participation. The Tallinn Manual provides that the scope of direct participation includes the actions immediately preceding and those subsequent to the qualifying act of direct participation in hostilities. The majority of the Tallinn Experts agree that a civilian is directly targetable only for the duration of the direct participation in hostilities, regardless of when the actual effects are realized. Yet, some of the experts take the position that the time period during which a civilian can be directly targeted extends for as long as there is a causal link to the intended harm. That is, a civilian is targetable as far upstream and as far downstream as that civilian’s causal link exists between the action taken and the intended harm. As an example, a civilian may be targeted as early as when he begins a cyber operation by probing the enemy’s system and carry through to when he conducts the cyber operation against the system. The civilian may even be targeted after the cyber operation, when he is conducting a damage assessment and determining whether to conduct another operation against the system.\nThese temporal considerations are worth exploring because they mostly exist only in the cyber context. Accordingly, there may be a disconnect between how States view cyber operations versus operations in the physical world due to the way LOAC principles were developed for the physical world. Though it is possible to parallel these temporal considerations by discussing IEDs emplaced for the destruction of the enemy State’s equipment and the injury of its people, there is not a precise match. While IEDs can be emplaced with the intent of them going off in the future upon being activated, IEDs with this setup cannot be controlled and changed like their logic bomb counterpart in the cyber world. Applying LOAC principles to an IED would yield\n TALLINN MANUAL, *supra* note 52, at Rule 35, comment 7.\n *Id.* at Rule 35, comment 8.\n *Id.* at Rule 35, comment 7.\n *Id.*\n *Id.*\n *Id.*\n\n[Vol. XLII\nthe bomb maker likely being targetable while building the bomb, based on his intent, and the civilian emplacing the IED being targetable while emplacing the IED. It would not be as clean cut in the cyber world based on the ability of the logic bomb builder and the one who activates it to carry out the entire operation in complete anonymity as well as being able to control the logic bomb once it is emplaced.\nFor the sake of clarifying the discussion below, the civilians being discussed are non-state-affiliated civilians. State-affiliated civilians are those who operate as either private contractors on behalf of the State or as civilian employees, who are employed by the State. These civilians are better aware of their exposure to direct attack based on the nature of their service, which could include operational as well as geographic proximity to armed forces. Thus, the State and the state-affiliated civilians are on notice as to whether and for how long the civilians may be directly targeted by the opposing state during an armed conflict.\nAdditional Protocol I provides that civilians and civilian populations enjoy general protection against dangers arising from military operations. However, civilians forfeit this protection if and for so long as they directly participate in hostilities. Direct participation by civilians in cyberspace is not always clear. The International Group of Experts was split regarding repeated cyber operations by civilians that qualified as direct participation in hostilities. Some of the experts side with ICRC guidance, which provides that each act must be treated separately as separate acts of direct participation. Other experts conclude separate direct participation analysis made little operational sense and believe it would create a “revolving door” effect regarding targetability. This group of experts believes direct participation by the civilian begins with the first cyber operation he participates in and continues throughout the period of intermittent activity. This incongruent application of existing LOAC principles on cyberspace operations demonstrates the potential for civilians and\n Protocol I, supra note 1, art. 51.\n Id.\n TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 52, Rule 35, comment 7.\n Id.\n Id.\n Id.\n\nparties to an armed conflict to misapply or misinterpret LOAC principles.\nWhat if a non-state-affiliated civilian were to create an autonomous logic bomb and release it with the intent to infiltrate and attack the computer network of the defense ministry of a State which is party to an ongoing armed conflict? At what point could the civilian be targeted by the State? If the State discovers the logic bomb months after it was released by the civilian, and assuming the State can attribute it to the civilian, can the State target the civilian then? Under ICRC guidance, the civilian could be directly targeted for each act of direct participation in hostilities. Accordingly, the civilian could be directly attacked when producing the logic bomb with the intent to launch a CNA against the State, if done so in support of another party to the conflict, and when the civilian actually launches the logic bomb. However, ICRC guidance would not likely support a direct attack against the civilian if discovered months after it was launched. Under the Tallinn Manual’s viewpoint, the civilian may be directly targeted.\nAs discussed above, it may be unclear to civilians directly participating in hostilities in the cyber domain as to how their actions could be interpreted by parties to an armed conflict. Aside from civilians conducting intermittent direct participation in hostilities in cyberspace, civilians may also be unclear as to their exposure for direct targeting due to the uncertain application of LOAC principles to the cyber domain. Specifically, civilians launching autonomous or semi-autonomous programs to attack computer networks may directly participate in hostilities by building the code and program for the specific purpose as well as directly participate by launching the CNA. However, these civilians may at some point decide they no longer wish to pursue the action against a party to an armed conflict.\n JEAN-MARIE HENCKAERTS &amp; LOUISE DOSWALD-BECK, CUSTOMARY INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW VOL. 1: RULES 1, 21 (2005).\n Id.\n Id. at 23.\n Turns, supra note 62, at 281.\n\n[Vol. XLII\n## B. Change of Heart for Civilians Directly Participating in Cyber Hostilities\nHow might a civilian make clear to a State embroiled in an armed conflict that the civilian who conducted a cyber operation against the State no longer wishes to directly participate in cyber hostilities? In the physical domain, the civilian would simply stop shooting at the party, collecting arms to use against the party, building bombs to emplace in roadways, or collecting money to finance attacks against the party to the conflict. An example which could parallel the cyber domain would be a civilian bomb maker who makes a bomb and emplaces that bomb in a road in an effort to target a party to an armed conflict. However, the bomb maker could make clear his intentions to no longer directly participate by putting up a sign warning of the bomb, digging up the bomb, or telling the party the location of the bomb. In cyberspace, a civilian who creates the malicious code for the CNA and launches it may not be able to recall the code or stop the cyber operation once it has begun. Once the malicious code is discovered, the targeted State may attack the civilian because it is impossible to precisely determine if the civilian has stopped directly participating in cyber hostilities. The State could argue the civilian is still monitoring and directing the logic bomb or malicious code.\nThe advanced technology which enables civilians to directly participate in hostilities could make it difficult for both the civilian and the party to the armed conflict to know when the civilian is no longer directly participating. The civilian who produces the malicious code for a CNA concludes his direct participation when he stops working on or even finishes the code. Would the civilian who launches the malicious code for a CNA conclude his direct participation when the code is launched? What if the malicious code were autonomous or semi-autonomous, and it would continue to operate without the aid from the civilian? This would seem to be a magic bullet fired in the physical world. In the physical domain, the bullet would lose speed and fall to the earth. However, malicious code launched in the cyber domain may\n *Id.*\n *Id.*\n *Id.*\n\ncontinue until it is discovered and counter by the attacked party or until it reaches its termination stage, if it has one. May the civilian launching this code be directly targeted until the malicious code ceases to operate as part of the CNA?\nCurrent interpretations by the ICRC and the International Group of Experts contributing to the Tallinn Manual apply IHL to the cyber domain and determine that the civilian launching the CNA code can only be targeted so long as he is directly participating in hostilities, which is when he is actively engaged. The ICRC and the Group of Experts are unwilling to extend the window of targetability to include ongoing hostilities set in motion by the individual unleashing the malicious code aimed at conducting a CNA. As previously stated in the magic bullet analogy, there is nothing to stop the CNA code except for the initiator, unless the attacked State becomes aware of the CNA and takes steps to defend against it. Accordingly, should not the attacked State be able to target the civilian initiator after he has set in motion the CNA? If the State is able to stretch the targetability window to legally target the initiating civilian so long as the CNA is underway, can the civilian limit his exposure in any way?\nA solution might be found in the American Law Institute’s Model Penal Code (“MPC”). The MPC defines criminal conspiracy as a person conspiring with another person or group of persons to commit a crime if the individual, with the purpose of promoting or facilitating the crime: 1) agrees with the other person or group that one or more of them will engage in conduct constituting a crime; or 2) agrees to aid the other person or group in planning or committing the crime. However, the actor may, after having conspired to commit a crime, use as an affirmative defense the fact that the actor thwarted the success of the conspiracy after having manifested a complete and voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose. By renouncing his support for the crime and thwarting the success of the conspiracy, the actor is able to undo the effort he put into conspiring to commit the crime.\n Eva Knopova, *New IHL Framework for Cyber Warfare: Master’s Thesis*, CHARLES UNIV. PRAGUE DEP’T INT’L L. 47 (2016).\n Id.\n American Law Institute, *MODEL PENAL CODE § 5.03* (Tent. Draft No. 4, 1955).\n Id.\n\n[Vol. XLII]\nAs applied to the above issue regarding civilians directly participating in cyber hostilities, a civilian putting into place malicious code capable of autonomously conducting a CNA may be able to be certain he cannot be directly targeted by the party to an armed conflict by renouncing his support for the cyber hostilities and working to thwart further cyber hostilities by the code. By attempting to prevent future direct targeting, the civilian may inadvertently leave himself exposed to attack by making his actions and identity known to the party. However, a party to an armed conflict abiding by LOAC would not be able to target a civilian who is no longer participating in hostilities. Further, the civilian may take similar actions to renounce his participation and thwart further action by the code in an anonymous way.\nBy adopting this view, States who are a party to an armed conflict have better ground rules as to how to legally target non-state-affiliated civilians who are participating in cyber hostilities in a way that may not be covered by current IHL. Additionally, under this view, civilians will have a better understanding of how their actions, carried out as cyber operations, will be treated by States who are a party to an armed conflict. This view provides States and civilians with notice of how actions by civilians will be treated in cyberspace. Further, this view provides civilians who have participated in cyber hostilities, and who may be determined to be still participating based on the autonomous CNA code the individual initiated, an opportunity to remove themselves from hostilities. By taking steps discussed in the MPC to remove oneself from a conspiracy, the initiating individual can undo the bonds currently opening himself up to being targeted by a party to the conflict.\nBy coming forward, renouncing his support for the ongoing cyber hostilities, and attempting to thwart the object of the cyber\n HENCKAERTS &amp; DOSWALD-BECK, supra note 260, at 19–20.\n See generally INT’L &amp; OPERATIONAL L. DEP’T., THE JUDGE ADVOCATE GEN.’S LEGAL CTR. &amp; SCH., U.S. ARMY, LAW OF ARMED CONFLICT DESKBOOK, 7 (2015) (explaining that “[o]nly combatants or those directly participating in hostilities may be targeted . . . [n]on-combatants, including civilians and persons out of combat, may not intentionally be targeted”).\n HENCKAERTS &amp; DOSWALD-BECK, supra note 260, at 19–20.\n American Law Institute, supra note 269.\n\noperation, a civilian may prevent the targeted State from directly targeting the civilian. However, the civilian may also be creating an unexpected repercussion. The civilian directly taking part in cyber hostilities, favoring a party to an armed conflict by conducting cyber operations against an opponent party, also exposes himself to domestic criminal law pertaining to the cyber operations. By coming forward, the civilian may be opening himself up to prosecution under domestic criminal law in an effort to prevent being directly targeted by the State against whom the civilian directly participated in hostilities. This may create a disincentive for civilians to expose themselves as ongoing direct participants in cyber hostilities, but the damage is already done.\nThe only question that remains is attribution. Can the attacked State determine who the civilian is for either direct targeting purposes or domestic criminal prosecution? If the civilian believes so, the civilian could limit his exposure to being directly attacked as well as request leniency from the domestic criminal prosecution for his cooperation. The alternative is for the civilian to figure out a way to completely remove every trace of his participation in an ongoing cyber operation, thereby ensuring the attacked State does not discover the cyber operation, attribute it to the civilian, and directly attack him.\nWithout this possible outlet, civilians who have had a change of heart and no longer wish to participate in cyber hostilities may be targeted in the future for previous participation in cyber hostilities, of which they no longer wish to be a part. Though not a perfect method for keeping civilians safe from being directly targeted, this method provides notice to the attacking State of the civilian’s previous acts, which are the acts the civilian no longer wishes to be held accountable for in the realm of armed conflict. The civilian’s renouncing of previous participation in hostilities will not absolve him of domestic law implications, but it will ensure he is not targeted in the future.\n\n[Vol. XLII]\n# VII. Conclusion\nCivilians directly participate in hostilities for numerous reasons. State-affiliated civilians might engage in direct participation as part of their job; non-state-affiliated civilians might directly participate out of a sense of patriotism, helping the underdog, or feeling like part of the fight. Cyberspace creates an environment unlike any other ever seen before, so civilians and States who are a party to an armed conflict struggle to understand how LOAC principles apply to their conduct. A misunderstanding by a civilian could lead to a prolonged period of being directly targeted by a party to a conflict; a misunderstanding by that party could lead to allegations of war crimes. All sides to a conflict, to include civilians, would benefit from consensus in the application of LOAC to the cyber domain.\nA consensus in the application of LOAC principles in the cyber domain could lead to stronger footing for States and citizens as the cyberspace domain becomes a larger battleground. Cyberspace issues such as anonymity, attribution, temporal considerations, and equal application of force between the physical and cyber domains all highlight the need to better define LOAC applications to the cyber domain. Specifically, civilians should be able to renounce their direct participation in cyber hostilities, and they should no longer face direct targeting by a party to a conflict for cyber operations taken previously. The Tallinn Manual spells out that civilians may be directly targeted so long as their causal link to the action exists. States subscribing to this view may link civilians to cyber operations carried out previously, even after civilians have walked away and no longer desire to directly participate.\nThe ability to target civilians for previous acts of cyber hostilities when States believe a causal link still exists may lead to an expanded window of time during which a civilian may be targeted. Thus, States who are party to a conflict should be able to know with certainty that the civilian they intend to target is a lawful target, due to the civilian’s ongoing intent to directly participate in hostilities. The renunciation clause found in the Model Penal Code could be the solution to ending\n Turns, supra note 62, at 281.\n Id.\n\nmisunderstandings by civilians and parties to a conflict regarding direct participation and targeting.\nUnder this view, civilians have a way to guarantee they will no longer be directly targeted for past cyber operations amounting to direct participation in hostilities when the State may not know the civilian’s participation has concluded. In addition, this view provides an out for States directly targeting civilians for directly participating in cyber hostilities against the State because the civilian has the opportunity and incentive to come clean if the civilian no longer wishes to directly participate. By coming forward, civilians may open themselves up to domestic prosecution, but they guarantee they will not be directly targeted by a State.\nA final point is examined by asking: should civilians have to go to such lengths to ensure they will not be directly targeted by a State for previous instances of direct participation in hostilities? Further, should LOAC require citizens to take active steps to put States on notice as to the citizens’ activities to prevent being illegally targeted after the direct participation in hostilities has concluded? An argument can be made that this policy would be requiring too much of civilians, and it exposes civilians to a lose-lose scenario.\nOn the one hand, civilians want to ensure the temporal anomalies in the cyber domain do not mislead States into falsely believing civilians are continuing to directly participate in hostilities after participation has ended. On the other, civilians want to protect against domestic prosecution and initiating an investigation into their activities. Though a possible solution to the issue of civilians being overly or illegally targeted could be found in the Model Penal Code, international law may not be willing to support the process or potential side effects to civilians providing notice to States that the civilians have withdrawn from the direct participation in hostilities.\n\n^{}[]",

Introduction\nThe Law of Armed Conflict (“LOAC”) has evolved over the past century and a half to protect civilians from the harms caused by war as well as to put all parties on notice as to their expected conduct. Civilians, like any other group, are not prohibited from directly participating in hostilities, but they lose their protection from being directly targeted for such time as they chose to do so. This protection for civilians is easier understood as it is applied to the physical domain, for which it was created. The cyber domain is vastly different. Accordingly, civilians and States who are party to international armed conflicts are left to apply their own understanding of how LOAC principles should be applied to the cyber domain.\nThe difference of interpretation by civilians and parties to armed conflict could leave civilians overly exposed to direct attack and parties accountable for war crimes. This is especially true for non-state-affiliated civilians conducting cyber hostilities against a State that is party to an armed conflict. The differentiation between state-affiliated and non-state-affiliated civilians matters, because state-affiliated civilians should understand they may be injured or killed based on their work alongside and their proximity to armed forces. Thus, they are likely on notice that they may be directly targeted if directly participating in hostilities as well as considered collateral damage during a legal attack by an enemy State. In addition, civilians may open themselves up to an extended period of time during which they may be directly targeted based on the type of cyber operation they conduct.\nVarying views support the notion that civilians intermittently participating directly in hostilities may be targeted throughout a linked-together period of participation. Further, if a civilian were to launch against a State a cyber operation that activates at a set point in the future or after a forecasted event, the State could possibly treat the civilian as directly participating in hostilities long after the civilian actually initiated and participated in the cyber operation. This delayed direct targeting of the civilian can happen either because the State is unaware of exactly when the cyber operation was launched against it or because it interprets its\n Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts, June 8, 1977, 110 Stat. 2104, 1125 U.N.T.S. 51 [hereinafter Protocol I].\n\nresponse as warranted under LOAC.\nAlong with opening themselves up to being directly targeted, civilians participating in cyber hostilities may also face domestic criminal law exposure for their cyber hostilities. States that are party to an armed conflict could seek to lawfully target the civilian rather than await a domestic law prosecution. A possible solution to civilians being overly exposed to direct attack for their decision to directly participate in cyber hostilities could come from the Model Penal Code’s view of renouncing one’s role and thwarting the overall success of the act. Under this theory, a civilian could make the enemy State aware of the civilian’s plot to conduct an ongoing cyber operation against the State in an effort to absolve the civilian of being targeted in the future. However, these civilians may still face domestic criminal law repercussions for doing so.\n## II. The Treatment of Civilians in Traditional Warfare\nWhether it is their own loss of life or injury, the loss or injury of a relative, or the collateral damage of their property, civilians always suffer during war. Accordingly, major nation states have been working together for over a century to address the way traditional wars are fought, and they have sought to add a sense of humanity and require discrimination in targeting. In 1949, major nation states acceded to the Fourth Geneva Convention, which was called “The Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War” and sought to protect noncombatants.\nPrior to the Geneva Conventions, civilians were left to the mercy of the combatants and their beliefs as to sparing civilians. The Geneva Conventions codified what had been inching closer to customary law for decades. The movement in this direction can be seen by the Lieber Code, which sought to regulate war; and later the Declaration of St. Petersburg in 1868, which prohibited the use of specific weapons for humanitarian reasons. The\n Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, Aug. 12, 1949, 110 Stat. 2104, 75 U.N.T.S. 287 [hereinafter Geneva Convention].\n See ANICÉE VAN ENGELAND, CIVILIAN OR COMBATANT?: A CHALLENGE FOR THE 21ST CENTURY ix-xix (2011).\n Id.\n Id. at 13–14.\n\n[Vol. XLII]\ninternational agreement formed at the 1874 Brussels Convention discussed laws and customs of war and provided that combatant forces are not granted unlimited power as to how to injure the enemy. This provision was later codified in the Hague Regulations of 1907, as was the general understanding of the need for discrimination between civilians and combatants. Additionally, the Hague Peace Conferences of 1899 and 1907 became the first internationally codified documents providing that civilians should not suffer from the effects of hostilities.\n## A. Geneva Convention and the Additional Protocol\nThe Fourth Geneva Convention, which occurred in 1949, specifically sought to protect civilians during times of war. Under the Fourth Geneva Convention, persons taking no active part in the hostilities are to be treated humanely and without regard to their faith, sex, race, or religion. In addition, parties to the conflict are to establish neutral zones in regions of combat to shelter wounded and sick combatants and civilians taking no part in hostilities from the effects of war. The wounded and the sick are specifically protected and should be provided particular care and respect.\nIn addition to the Fourth Geneva Convention, the Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (“Additional Protocol I”) is a 1977 amendment to the Geneva Convention that focuses on the protection of victims of international armed conflicts. Protocol I calls for the protection and care of the wounded, sick, and shipwrecked regardless of whether they are military or civilians. To protect civilians from unnecessary injury or death, Protocol I obliges combatants to distinguish themselves from the civilian population while engaged\n *Id.*\n *Id.*\n *Id.*\n See Geneva Convention, *supra* note 2.\n *Id.* art. 3.\n *Id.* art. 14.\n *Id.*\n Protocol I, *supra* note 1, art. 3.\n *Id.*\n\nin an attack. The civilian population is specifically protected under Part IV, which demands the parties to distinguish at all times between civilian populations and combatants; as well as between civilian objects and military objectives. Further, Protocol I provides that if there is doubt as to whether a person is a civilian, that person should be treated as a civilian. In addition, parties are prohibited from making the civilian population the object of an attack, or making acts or threats intended to terrorize the civilian population.\nProtocol I also protects civilians by prohibiting indiscriminate attacks such as those not directed at a specific military objective as well as the use of combat means that cannot be sufficiently limited. However, there are limits because the presence or movement of civilians will not render certain areas immune from military operations. For example, if a party to the conflict uses a movement of civilians to shield military objects, that party would be in violation of the Protocol. The purpose of the Additional Protocol is to protect civilians during armed conflicts, so a State using civilians as shields will be held accountable for the LOAC violation. In addition, the Hague Convention states that the right of belligerents to adopt means of injuring the enemy is not unlimited. By limiting the means used against the enemy, civilians are also protected from unnecessary suffering due to the type of weapons used in warfare. The purpose of the Hague Convention was to infuse humanity into armed conflicts. By forcing States to use approved weapons, which take into account human suffering, civilians are indirectly protected from inhumane weaponry.\nProtocol I requires precautionary measures to be taken during\n\n[Vol. XLII\nattack planning to limit the injury and death of civilians, as well as damage to civilian objects. Specifically, Article 57 instructs parties to take constant care in military operations to spare civilians and civilian objects by requiring parties to verify objectives to be attacked and to take all feasible precautions to avoid and minimize incidental loss of civilian life or injury. The parties must also refrain from launching any attack that may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, civilian injury, or loss of civilian property. Further, parties are required to cancel or suspend attacks if it becomes clear the objective is not a military one or that the attack will cause loss of civilian life or property or will cause civilian injuries. Protocol I also requires parties, to the maximum extent feasible, remove civilians and civilian objects from the vicinity of military objects. In addition, parties are to avoid locating military objects within or near densely populated areas. The purpose of these measures are to ensure States are being mindful of civilians and civilian property from the beginning of attack planning all the way through the attacks themselves.\n## B. Civilians Directly Participating in Hostilities\nProtocol I protects civilians when viewed as innocent bystanders, but what if civilians participate in hostilities? Under the Protocol, parties to an international armed conflict may only target civilians for such time as the civilians take a direct part in hostilities. At that point, the civilians lose their civilian status protection and can then be targeted by combatants as legally permissible. The timeframe for which civilians can be targeted while directly participating in hostilities is defined by Protocol I as the time during which they are participating. However, it is important to keep in mind that the right of the noncombatant population to protection involves a corresponding duty to abstain\n\nfrom hostilities.\nAs an example, if a civilian who is caught in the middle of an international armed conflict decides to pick up a rifle and shoot at a Party to the conflict, the Party’s armed force may target the civilian so long as the civilian poses a threat. If the civilian were to drop the rifle and run back to his house, he could no longer be targeted by the armed force. The targeting of civilians while directly participating in hostilities is rooted in LOAC; any potential domestic law violations would be determined by the civilian’s State. Civilians directly participating in hostilities may face repercussions based on their actions that violate domestic criminal laws as well as being targeted by the enemy State. The Third Geneva Convention also addresses civilians participating in hostilities.\nThe Third Geneva Convention (“Convention”) was adopted in 1949, and its purpose was the protection of the victims of war, both civilian and prisoner. This Convention mainly addresses the treatment of prisoners of war, but it also recognizes civilian participation in hostilities. Under this Convention, *levée en masse* is the spontaneous taking up of arms by civilian inhabitants of a non-occupied territory when the invading enemy approaches. In this case, the civilians would be allowed prisoner-of-war status because they participated in hostilities spontaneously, without the time to form themselves into regular armed units; but they must carry arms openly and respect the laws of war. Aside from prisoner of war status, LOAC also addresses combatant immunity and targetability.\nCombatant immunity is addressed in Protocol I, wherein it states that members of a Party’s armed force are combatants, and\n Karma Nabulsi, *Evolving Conceptions of Civilians and Belligerents: One Hundred Years After the Hague Peace Conferences, in CIVILIANS IN WAR 9, 16* (Simon Chesterman ed., 2001) (quoting Henry Richmond Droop, *On the Relations Between an Invading Army and the Inhabitants, and the Conditions Under Which Irregular Troops Are Entitled to the Same Treatment as Regular Soldiers*, TRANSACTIONS OF THE GROTIUS SOCIETY 713 (1871)).\n Geneva Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War art. 4, Aug. 12, 1949, 6 U.S.T. 3316, 75 U.N.T.S. 135 [hereinafter Geneva POW].\n *Id.*\n *Id.*\n *Id.*\n See Protocol I, supra note 1.\n\n[Vol. XLII]\nthey have the right to participate directly in hostilities. The term “combatant” excludes medical personnel, chaplains, and civilians. Accordingly, in international armed conflict, combatants enjoy immunity regarding their acts as part of hostilities, but it does not prohibit others from engaging in those types of hostilities. Although non-combatants are not specifically prohibited from engaging in hostilities during an armed conflict, they may be directly targeted by the enemy and may face domestic criminal charges for their actions. Therefore, civilians engaging in hostilities would not be entitled to the combatant immunity that is given to combatants participating in an international armed conflict. Thus, civilians would only be entitled to prisoner of war status in limited cases, and they would not be entitled to combatant immunity.\nRegarding targetability, civilians are not to be targeted by the parties to an armed conflict, and civilians are to be generally protected against the dangers arising from military operations. However, LOAC allows civilians to be targeted by an armed force if and for so long as the civilian is directly participating in hostilities. Therefore, civilians enjoy the freedom from targetability so long as they are not taking a direct part in the hostilities. This freedom from direct targetability extends to a point under LOAC. A State choosing to target a legal military objective must determine if civilians and their property may be damaged by the attack. If so, the State must conduct a balancing test to ensure the necessity of taking out the military objective outweighs the possible damage that could be caused to civilians and their property. In summation, civilians do not have combatant immunity, they may be granted prisoner of war status during a levée en masse, and they cannot be directly targeted unless they are directly participating in hostilities.\nEven with the existence of International Humanitarian Law (“IHL”) seeking to protect civilians during times of war, civilians\n\nstill experience loss. IHL exists with the purpose of protecting civilians during an ongoing armed conflict, but civilians can still be legally killed or injured. If done according to the Geneva Conventions’ rules of discrimination and proportionality, nations may still strike enemy targets that lead to the loss of limbs, lives, and loved ones for civilians. As examples, fighter jets can strike a weapons cache next to an apartment complex, a convoy can speed through a school playground, and combatants can return fire in a crowded street. Aside from a country’s stance on ethics in times of war, the plight of civilians has practical drawbacks, such as the hatred survivors have toward foreign governments and protests following civilian casualties. The United States military came to understand that it is important to win the hearts and minds of the civilian population in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Based on the implications that the United States was callously indifferent regarding civilian casualties, it started tracking the damage it caused and responded directly to affected families. The efforts by the U.S. government to recognize the importance of paying respect to the families of injured or killed civilians is another step toward protecting civilians during times of war.\nInternational Humanitarian Law provides the basis for the protection of civilians during an ongoing armed conflict, but does that translate from the physical world to the cyber world? The cyberspace domain offers capabilities that are far different from the physical domain. Cyberspace provides the cloak of anonymity that may shield civilians and even States from being identified as the responsible party for cyber operations. The protections afforded to civilians have been roughly translated from the physical to the cyber domain by the Tallinn Manual’s International Group of Experts as well as Guidance by the International Committee of the Red Cross.\n### III. The Current Treatment of Civilians in the Cyberspace\n *Id.*\n Sarah Holewinski, *Do Less Harm: Protecting and Compensating Civilians in War*, FOREIGN AFF., Jan.–Feb. 2013, at 14.\n *Id.*\n *Id.*\n *Id.*\n *Id.*\n\n[Vol. XLII\n## Domain\nCivilians enjoy very much the same protections in the cyberspace domain as they do in the physical domain. The Tallinn Manual states that civilians are defined in the cyberspace domain as they are under the Additional Protocol I of the Geneva Convention. Specifically, civilians are defined in terms of neither being members of armed forces nor members of a *levée en masse*. As such, individual civilians, as well as civilian populations, shall not be the object of a cyber-attack by a party to the armed conflict. A cyber-attack is any cyber operation or activity that is reasonably expected to cause injury or death to a person or the damage or destruction to objects. In addition, LOAC applies to the targeting of people or objects during an armed conflict regardless of the means or methods of warfare that are used. These seemingly broad definitions are key to protecting civilians during armed conflicts because parties to the conflict are held accountable for actions taken which are incompatible with the law of war.\n## A. Cyber Operations and the Law of Armed Conflict\nDefining cyber warfare, as a whole, is better understood by looking at its component parts. Cyberspace, in general, is the domain within the information environment made up of the interdependent network of information technology infrastructures and the resident data. Cyber warfare can be viewed as a combined concept of cyberspace operations, offensive cyberspace operations, and defensive cyberspace operations. Cyber operations are the employment of cyberspace capabilities where the primary purpose is to achieve objectives in and through\n TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE 104-05 (Michael N. Schmitt, ed. 2013) [hereinafter TALLINN MANUAL].\n *Id.*\n *Id.* at 113–14.\n *Id.* at 106–10.\n *Id.* at 104–05.\n *Cyber*, DICTIONARY OF MILITARY AND ASSOCIATED TERMS, U.S. DEP’T DEFENSE 57–58 (8 Nov. 2010 as amended through 15 Feb. 2016), http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/new_pubs/jp1_02.pdf [https://perma.cc/5UH8-B36A].\n *Id.*\n\ncyberspace. Offensive cyberspace operations are those intended to project power by the application of force in and through cyberspace.\nDefensive cyberspace operations are the passive and active cyberspace operations carried out to preserve the ability to use friendly cyberspace capabilities to protect data, networks, and other systems. Examples of cyber warfare include the gaining of access to a computer system to acquire control over it, transmission of viruses to destroy or alter data, use of logic bombs to sit idle in a system until a set time or occurrence, and insertion of a worm to reproduce until a system is overloaded. Understanding cyber warfare allows for a better understanding of how the LOAC principles are to be applied in the cyber domain.\nThe LOAC principles of proportionality, humanity, military necessity, and distinction apply to States operating in cyberspace in very much the same way as they apply in the physical domains. However, conducting operations in the cyber domain complicates the process because the operations are being carried out in an environment that is unreal and inherently unstable. Targeting for computer network attacks presents legal issues that are just as complex as physical attacks. Accordingly, States must exercise caution when planning and carrying out operations in cyberspace to ensure civilians are being protected. To do so, States conduct network reconnaissance for both operational requirements, as well as to ensure planned attacks do not cause collateral damage and casualties outside of what is acceptable under LOAC principles.\n Id.\n Id.\n Id.\n David Turns, *Cyber Warfare and the Notion of Direct Participation in Hostilities*, 17 J.

INT’L L. 391 (2010).\n Id.\n\n[Vol. XLII\nThere are some scholars and experts who view cyber operations as falling outside of the reach of the UN Charter or LOAC. Due to the UN Charter being written long before the advent of the Internet, the UN Charter was not written with a clear intention of including cyber operations. Scholars and experts adhering to this view believe the UN Charter encompasses only physical attacks, and cyber operations will almost certainly not involve the use of physical force. According to this line of thought, a country would not violate LOAC by deliberately launching cyber operations at civilian-owned targets. However, the Tallinn Manual examines cyber operations as falling under the UN Charter and being subject to LOAC.\nThe LOAC principle of distinction, as codified in Additional Protocol I, and incorporated into the Tallinn Manual, requires that parties to an armed conflict distinguish between the civilian population and combatants, as well as between civilian objects and military objectives. This requirement seeks to protect civilians and their property by holding the parties to armed conflict accountable for the targets they choose to attack. Further, the principle of distinction precludes any rationale or justification by a party for an attack not permitted by LOAC. In cases where there is doubt as to whether a person is a civilian in the cyber domain, that person shall be considered a civilian. This requirement complicates the cyber battlefield, because there are many civilians using computers and computer networks, and it may be very difficult to discern who is and is not a civilian.\nDetermining whether actors in the cyberspace domain are civilians, and may possibly be targeted when directly participating in hostilities during an international armed conflict, is difficult. Inaccurate attribution in cyberspace may leave vulnerable the civilians caught in the crossfire. The International Court of Justice maintains high standards for requisite attribution of an armed attack, and in the cyber domain, attribution for the act and actor\n See Cyber, supra note 57.\n Id.\n Id.\n See TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 52.\n Geneva Convention, supra note 2, art. 14; Geneva POW, supra note 34, art. 4.\n TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 52, at Rule 33.\n Id.\n\nare difficult to prove with scientific certainty. Further, this attribution on the Internet is “the most technologically challenging level of attribution,” because the attributing party is seeking “to determine the original individual or entity that is responsible for launching the attack.”\nIn the United States, the White House, State Department, and Department of Defense recognize the need to treat cyber operations as potentially falling under the UN Charter and requiring a LOAC determination prior to employment. Specifically, there is concern from these agencies that the use of cyber weapons could trigger unintended consequences and might harm diplomatic relations. Senior military officials have stated that attribution of cyber-attacks has remained a challenge, and that challenge factors into the difficulty of determining what constitutes a cyber act of war. Further, the National Security Director and U.S. Cyber Command chief has stated that the United States needs to think outside of the cyber realm regarding retaliation, and it needs to define acceptability limits regarding hacking. In addition, the United States needs to prepare a set of capabilities and show its determination for using them. Members of the U.S. Congress have echoed the need for cyber deterrence\n See Jason F.

The National Security Director and Cyber Command Chief has stated that anything the United States does in the cyber arena must follow LOAC, so cyber responses must be proportional and in line with historical norms. Further, cyberspace capabilities and operations parallel those in the physical domain, but cyber represents a different technical application in an attempt to achieve some of the exact same effects. Additionally, the development of cyber weapons represents the next evolutionary step in warfare, so it possesses all of the ethical concerns posed by similar weapons developed in the past. Therefore, the United States places great importance on maintaining compliance with LOAC even though cyber capabilities and operations were not planned for by the LOAC founders.\n## B. The Objects of Cyber Attacks\nThe Tallinn Manual also discusses who may be made the object of cyber-attacks and lists them as: 1) members of the armed forces; 2) members of organized armed groups; 3) civilians taking a direct part in hostilities; and 4) participants in a *levée en masse* during an international armed conflict. It should be noted that the first two categories can be made the object of an attack based on their status; however, the last two categories can only be made targets based on their actions. Members of organized armed\n *Id.*\n *Id.*\n Patrick Tucker, *NSA Chief: Rules of War Apply to Cyberwar*, Too, DEF. ONE (Apr. 20, 2015), http://cdn.defenseone.com/defenseone/interstitial.html?v=2.1.1&amp;rf=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.defenseone.com%2Ftechnology%2F2015%2F04%2Fnsa-chief-rules-war-apply-cyberwar-too%2F110572%2F [https://perma.cc/8RJM-ZLQT].\n *Id.*\n *Id.*\n *Id.*\n Geneva POW, *supra* note 34, art. 4.\n\ngroups are defined differently from different sources. The Tallinn Manual’s International Group of Experts were split over whether mere membership in such a group suffices or whether members would be required to show a continuous combat function. The continuous combat function is a requirement provided by the International Committee of the Red Cross in its guidance. This guidance requires the organized armed group to belong to a party to the conflict, demonstrated by conducting hostilities on behalf and with the agreement of the party. Further, members of the organized armed groups demonstrate their membership only by assuming continuous functions for the group, which involves direct participation in hostilities.\nThe second two categories of individuals who can be made the object of a cyber-attack are civilians who directly participate in hostilities, which will be addressed below, and participants in a levée en masse during an international armed conflict. Inhabitants of unoccupied territory during an international armed conflict who engage in cyber operations as part of a levée en masse are afforded combatant immunity and prisoner of war status. In addition, participants in a cyber-based levée en masse are targetable throughout the period of their participation therein. To be considered a levée en masse, the participating individuals must be inhabitants of non-occupied territory, who upon the invading enemy’s approach, take up arms to resist them. In the cyber context, “taking up arms” refers to engaging in cyber operations against the enemy.\nThis “taking up arms” in cyberspace is theoretical based on the facts that would have to exist for a cyber levée en masse to be\n *Id.*\n *Id.*\n Nils Melzer, *Interpretive Guidance on the Notion of Direct Participation Under International Humanitarian Law*, INT’L COMM. RED CROSS 1, 37 (2009), https://www.icrc.org/eng/assets/files/other/icrc-002-0990.pdf [https://perma.cc/N8G8-BMSB] (explaining particular difficulties relating to private contractors and civilian employees).\n *Id.* at Part I, 2, b.\n *Id.* at Part II, 1.\n TALLINN MANUAL, *supra* note 52, at Rule 27.\n *Id.* at Rule 34, comment 9.\n *Id.* at Rule 27.\n *Id.*\n\n[Vol. XLII]\nlawfully carried out. In the physical world, the levée en masse occurs when the enemy invades, and the inhabitants take on arms to defend themselves without being organized. However, this levée en masse is still required to carry arms openly and respect the laws and customs of war, though they are not required to wear identifying attire. In the cyber domain, a levée en masse could occur if, in response to a physical invasion, members of the population spontaneously mount cyber operations against the invaders. Further, the International Group of Experts are divided as to whether levée en masse privileges can apply to a civilian population engaged in countering a massive cyber-attack in lieu of a physical invasion.\nIn general, civilians should be protected in the cyberspace domain in much the same way as they are protected in the physical domains. The difference is the virtually untested nature of the cyberspace domain. It remains unclear exactly how States are to behave in cyberspace, what rises to the level of a cyber-attack, and what level of physical domain response is authorized for a particular cyber-attack. These and other unresolved translations from the physical realm to the cyber domain make difficult the protection of civilians during an international armed conflict. A step further would be the impact on civilians when they decide to directly participate in cyber hostilities.\n## IV. Civilians Directly Participating in Hostilities in the Cyberspace Domain\nThe Tallinn Manual provides that, based on LOAC principles, there is no bar of any category of person from participating in cyber operations, whether during an international or non-international armed conflict. However, civilians participating in an armed conflict through cyber operations would likely not be entitled to prisoner of war status and combatant immunity, and they could be targeted based on their participation. The\n *Id.*\n Geneva POW, *supra* note 34, art. 4.\n *Id.*\n *Id.*\n *Id.*\n TALLINN MANUAL, *supra* note 52, at Rule 25.\n *Id.* at Rule 25, comment 2.\n\nentitlement to combatant immunity and prisoner of war status are dependent upon the individual being engaged in an international armed conflict, as opposed to solely a non-international armed conflict or actions not rising to the level of armed conflict. Even if civilians participate in hostilities, the majority of the International Group of Experts agree that civilians retain their civilian status. However, civilians remain subject to prosecution under the applicable domestic laws of the States capturing them.\n## A. Defining Direct Participation in Hostilities\nAs previously mentioned, civilians can be made the object of cyber-attacks if they are directly taking part in hostilities. Though civilians are protected from attack during international armed conflicts, they lose that protection if and for so long as they directly participate in hostilities. This protection from attack and subsequent loss of protection only applies to civilians; it does not apply to members of armed forces, organized armed groups, or participants in a *levée en masse*. Further, members of groups failing to qualify as organized armed groups would also qualify as civilians under this rule. For example, a group would fail to be recognized as an organized armed group if they lack the required level of organization or if they fail to maintain a continuous combat function.\nConducting operations in cyberspace that may rise to the level of direct participation in hostilities can be better understood by looking at the functions or tasks carried out in the cyber domain. Those involved in cyber operations seemingly fall in to three main categories according to their functions: 1) those who design or write the programs used for offense or defensive cyber operations; 2) those who install these programs on computer systems, act as service administrators, and provide technical maintenance; and 3)\n *Id.* at Rule 25.\n *Id.* at Rule 29.\n *Id.* at Rule 29.\n *Id.* at Rules 32, 35.\n Geneva POW, *supra* note 34, art. 4; TALLINN MANUAL, *supra* note 52, at Rule 35.\n *Id.*\n *Id.* art. 4; Melzer, *supra* note 90, at Part I.2.b.\n\n[Vol. XLII\nthose who actually operate the computer programs. A lone civilian could presumably be filling all of these roles in a solo operation.\nWhen civilians directly participate in hostilities through cyber operations during an international armed conflict, they are liable to be attacked either through cyber means or other lawful means under LOAC. IHL does not define direct participation in hostilities, so direct participation must be interpreted in good faith according to the ordinary meaning and the context based on the object and purpose of IHL. Treaty law in this area refers to hostilities in terms of international or non-international armed conflict, so that should be the threshold; hostilities cannot refer to internal disturbances, riots, or isolated and sporadic events. Not all conduct during an armed conflict constitutes part of hostilities. Civilian participation in hostilities can occur in various forms and intensity levels in a wide variety of geographical, cultural, political, and military contexts, so the circumstances at the relevant time and place of the hostilities should be examined.\nThe direct participation in hostilities refers to specific acts, which are carried out by individuals as part of the hostilities between two parties in an armed conflict. There are therefore two elements: 1) direct participation; and 2) hostilities. Participation in hostilities can either be direct or indirect; direct participation is the engagement in specific hostile acts. The concept of hostilities is best described as the aggregate of all hostile acts carried out by all individuals, either armed forces, organized armed groups, or civilians, during an armed conflict.\nThe specific acts carried out by civilians qualify as direct participation in hostilities if they meet all of the following criteria:\n Cyber, supra note 57.\n Geneva POW, supra note 34, art. 4; TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 52, at Rule 35.\n Melzer, supra note 90, at Part II.B.\n Id.\n Id.\n Id.\n Id. at Part VI.\n Id.\n Melzer, supra note 90, at Part VI.\n\n1) the act is likely to adversely affect the military operations or capacity of a party to an armed conflict or inflict death, injury, or destruction on persons or objects protected against direct attack, which is the threshold of harm; 2) there must be a direct causal link between the act and harm that is likely to occur from the act; and 3) the act must be specifically designed to directly cause the required threshold of harm in support of a party to the armed conflict. The threshold of harm is based on likely harm and does not require the act to materialize into the expected level of harm. Additionally, the act does not have to be an actual attack against troops or military objects; it also includes acts of sabotage as well as disturbing deployments and communications.\nIn addition to meeting the threshold of harm, the second criterion requires there also be a direct causal link between the act and the harm. For there to be direct causation, there must be a sufficiently close causal relationship between the act and the resulting harm. Specifically, direct causation should be brought about in one causal step. Individual actions that can be viewed as merely supporting one side to an armed conflict or that only build up or maintain the capacity of a party is excluded from the concept of direct participation in hostilities. For example, providing supplies for a party or financing the actions of a party to an armed conflict would bring about a result, but there is not direct causation for the potential harm. Other examples of indirect participation would be scientific research and design, recruitment and the training of personnel, and the production or transportation of weapons or equipment.\nThe third criterion requires there be a belligerent nexus, which is that an act must be specifically designed to directly cause the required threshold of harm in support of a party to the armed conflict. Accordingly, the act must be objectively likely to inflict harm, and it must be specifically designed to do so in\n *Id.* at Part V.\n *Id.*\n *Id.*\n *Id.* at Part V.2.b.\n *Id.* at Part V.2.f.\n Melzer, *supra* note 90, at Part V.\n *Id.* at Part V.2.b.\n *Id.* at Part V.3.\n\n[Vol. XLII]\nsupport of a party to the armed conflict. Therefore, violence that is not designed to harm a party to an armed conflict cannot amount to direct participation in hostilities. This type of violence is left solely to domestic law enforcement measures and not LOAC or IHL. The belligerent nexus requirement is important, because there are many activities during armed conflict that cause a considerable level of harm but fall short of direct participation in hostilities. This is exemplified by violent crimes committed for reasons unrelated to the conflict, such as robberies or murders, as well as the theft of military equipment for private use or sale. Also requiring special attention is use of individual self-defense or defense of others. If a civilian uses force to protect his property from looting, he is not doing so with a belligerent nexus. Instead, he is acting out of self-defense.\nUnderstanding whether hostilities by civilians during armed conflict rise to the level of direct participation is not enough. The defining moment of when the direct participation in hostilities begins and ends is also important. Preparatory measures leading up to the execution of the specific act, and the movement to and from the location of the execution, all constitute integral parts of the act. Accordingly, IHL concerns itself with more than just exactly when the act took place; it looks at the totality of the circumstances surrounding the civilian’s direct participation in hostilities. This is a significant point, because civilians lose their protection against direct attacks for such time as they directly participate in hostilities.\nPreparatory measures are those that IHL would describe as military operations in preparation for an attack and which are so closely linked to the execution of the specific act that they constitute an integral part of the act. Even so, there is no requirement that the preparatory measures occur immediately prior to the specific act or even in close geographic proximity to the\n\nplace of the specific act. An example in the physical domain would be a civilian who builds a bomb in his garage, which he intends to place in the road in order to blow it up and injure armed forces during an international armed conflict. In this illustration, the preparatory measures taken by the civilian bomb maker in his garage, as well as the transit to and from the place where he plants the bomb, would all be considered part of the direct participation in hostilities. Thus, the bomb maker could be targeted at any point from when he starts building the bomb in his garage until he returns home from planting it. Also included in general preparatory measures would be the transporting of personnel, gathering of intelligence, and equipping and instructing armed forces. Where the execution of a hostile act does not require deployment, such as hostilities in cyberspace, the duration of the act should be limited to the immediate execution of the act.\n## B. Tallinn Manual View of Direct Participation in Hostilities\nThe Tallinn Manual’s International Group of Experts generally agrees with the three cumulative criteria for qualification as a direct participation in hostilities as applied to cyberspace. First, there must be a threshold of harm, wherein the civilian has the intended or actual effect of negatively affecting the military operations or capabilities of a party to an armed conflict or inflicting death, physical harm, or material destruction on persons or objects protected against direct attack. Physical damage to objects or harm to individuals is not required, so long as the cyber act negatively affects the party militarily. Second, there must be a direct causal link between the act and the harm intended. An example would be a civilian conducting cyber acts against an armed force in international armed conflict, wherein the civilian disrupts the command and control, even temporarily, for the armed force. Finally, there must be a belligerent nexus established by the\n *Id.*\n *Id.*\n Melzer, *supra* note 90, at Part VI.\n TALLINN MANUAL, *supra* note 52, at Rule 35, comment 4.\n *Id.*\n *Id.*\n *Id.*\n\n[Vol. XLII\nact directly relating to the hostilities.\nIn cyberspace, direct participation in hostilities by civilians may be more difficult to delineate. Determining whether a civilian directly participated in conventional hostilities is complex by itself; making the same determination in cyber-hostilities is especially so. Civilians conducting cyber-attacks related to an armed conflict would qualify as an act of direct participation in hostilities. A cyber-attack is defined as a cyber operation that is reasonably expected to cause injury or death to persons or damage or destruction to objects. Accordingly, civilians conducting cyber-attacks in this way would meet the three criteria for directly participating in hostilities. Other examples of direct participation include civilians conducting cyber operations with the intent to identify vulnerabilities in a targeted computer network or system, or civilians designing malware to take advantage of vulnerabilities in the systems of a party to an armed conflict. Further examples in the cyber domain include civilians using cyber means to gather information on enemy operations and passing that information to the other armed force in the conflict as well as conducting distributed denial of service operations against military systems.\nOn the other hand, not all cyber operations by civilians would rise to the level of direct participation in hostilities. For example, designing malware for a specific purpose and making it available online, even if it is actually used by someone else to conduct an attack during an armed conflict, would not be considered direct participation. What would be lacking would be the threshold of harm in the first criterion; the malware creator never had the intended or actual effect of negatively affecting military operations or capabilities. Another example would be civilians simply maintaining computer equipment generally, even if that equipment were eventually used in hostilities. Again, what would be\n *Id.*\n Emily Crawford, *Virtual Battlegrounds: Direct Participation in Cyber Warfare*, 9 J. L. &amp; POL’Y INFO. SOC’Y 1 (2013).\n TALLINN MANUAL, *supra* note 52, at Rule 35, comment 5.\n *Id.* at Rule 30.\n *Id.* at Rule 35, comment 5.\n *Id.*\n *Id.*\n *Id.*\n\nmissing is the threshold of harm at the first criterion.\nThe first criterion of the threshold of harm would also disqualify other cyber operations taken during an armed conflict. Cyber operations during an armed conflict that are taken for purely criminal or private reasons would not qualify as direct participation in hostilities. As an example, a criminal using cyber means to steal funds from a party to a conflict for purely personal gain, and not to negatively affect the party, would not be directly participating in hostilities. What is difficult about this example is that the party to the armed conflict would have to determine the intent of the civilian actor, which could be disguised as purely personal and criminal when it could in fact be aimed at adversely affecting the party to the conflict. Taken a step further, if the individual stole the money from the party in order to finance particular military operations, the operation to steal the money would be considered a direct participation in hostilities.\nPreparatory measures in cyberspace differ from those taken in the physical domain. Because civilians can be directly targeted for the duration of time during which they are directly participating in hostilities, it is important for parties to an armed conflict to understand the timeframe of direct participation. The actions taken in cyberspace immediately preceding or subsequent to a qualifying act of direct participation are included in the preparatory measures. As an example, a civilian travelling to and from the location of the computer he uses to mount a cyber operation would be included in the preparatory measures, and the civilian could be directly targeted in transit. The time for preparatory measures may even extend as far backward and forward in time as the causal link to the action exists. For example, in a cyber operation this would include the time when the civilian first starts to explore the vulnerabilities of the system of a party to an armed conflict, the time the individual creates the cyber tool to exploit the vulnerabilities, the period of time the civilian attacks the system, and through to the time the individual assesses\n TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 52, at Rule 35, comment 6.\n Id.\n Id.\n Id. at Rule 35, comment 7.\n Id.\n Id.\n\n[Vol. XLII\nthe damage to the system.\nIn addition to the preparatory measures taken for a cyber operation, parties to an armed conflict must take into account the delayed effects of direct participation in hostilities by civilians. The actions taken by civilians in the cyber domain have some parallels to the physical domain, but they also vary widely. The emplacement of a logic bomb, which is designed to activate at some point in the future upon either a command or after a predetermined period of time, is an example. The majority of the Tallinn Manual’s International Group of Experts takes the position that the time frame for which the civilian is directly participating, and can thus be targeted, is from the beginning of his involvement in mission planning until the individual terminates his active role in the operation. It is important to point out that the end of the period of direct participation may not sync up with the point when the damage occurs. For example, the first civilian may have created and emplaced the logic bomb, which is awaiting a command prompt to activate it. A second civilian may be the one to actually command the bomb to activate. In this example, the first civilian could have halted his period of direct participation and would no longer be directly targetable when the damage actually occurs. Thus, the key is for parties to determine when individuals are targetable based on when their participation begins and ends.\n## C. Determination of Direct Participation in Hostilities Complicated by Cyberspace-Specific Issues\nThe delayed effects of cyber operations complicate the accurate determination of precisely when a civilian is directly participating in cyber hostilities. The majority of the International Group of Experts takes the position that a civilian is directly participating in hostilities from the beginning of his involvement through the point in time where the civilian terminates an active role in the operation. The problem with this majority view is that it does not make clear to the participating civilian or to the\n TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 52, at Rule 35, comment 8.\n Id.\n Id.\n Id.\n Id. at Rule 35, comment 6.\n\nState being attacked the window of time during which the civilian may be directly and legally targeted. The civilian may terminate an active role by no longer checking the status of the ongoing cyber operation, but the State may still attribute the operation to the civilian and target him. The State may not discover the ongoing cyber operation until after the civilian has terminated an active role, but the State has no way of knowing the civilian has terminated his active role in the ongoing cyber operation.\nThe logic bomb example parallels civilian operations in the physical world. Coalition Forces fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan faced road-side improvised explosive devices (“IEDs”), which were responsible for causing death and injury to troops as well as damage to military objects. If a civilian was responsible for building, transporting, emplacing, and setting off the IED, the civilian could be targeted throughout the entire process. The beginning and end of the civilian’s direct participation in hostilities could be measured from the time he began sourcing parts for the bomb until the time he set off the IED and transited back from the bombsite. Similarly, the civilian responsible for the logic bomb in the aforementioned example could be targeted from the time he began creating the logic bomb until he commands the logic bomb to activate. However, technology in the cyber domain varies widely from technology in the physical domain.\nIn the cyber domain, individuals can create programs capable of running autonomously or semi-autonomously. A computer network attack (“CAN”) is defined as either a cyber, electronic, or physical attack against an information technology facility or against computer equipment. Most of these CNAs are carried out by cyber operations, which use malicious code to infect enemy computers in order to exploit weaknesses in software, system configuration, or computer security practices. Cyber operations also include the use of bots, or remotely, or semi-autonomously controlled programs infecting computers, as well as botnets, which perform espionage by transmitting data between themselves while\n *Id.* at Rule 35, comment 4 (providing that there is well-known, ongoing debate as to whether the assembly of an IED qualifies as direct participation in hostilities).\n See generally CLAY WILSON, COMPUTER ATTACK AND CYBERTERRORISM 3-11 (2009) (providing insight on different types of attacks against computers).\n *Id.*\n\n[Vol. XLII\nawaiting the final activation signal from the operator. Malicious programs, such as spyware and malware, attack by disrupting normal computer functions or by opening a back door for a remote operator to take control of the computer. Cyber operators have designed computer exploits which launch anonymously from thousands of infected computers and which produce waves of disruption to overwhelm the target of the operation. The technology allowing autonomous and semi-autonomous operations in cyberspace makes difficult the task of determining the beginning and ending points of direct participation by civilians.\nA minority of the Tallinn Manual Group of Experts would break down the various steps in cyber operations such as the emplacement of the logic bomb and its activation as separate acts of direct participation. Under this view, the civilian would only directly participate in hostilities in intermittent instances when he is actively engaged in hostilities. This view provides greater protection to civilians, as they are shielded from directly being targeted except for the times when they are actively engaged in cyber operations. However, this view would make it very difficult for the parties engaged in armed conflict to accurately determine when civilians are directly participating and then target the civilians participating in hostilities at precisely those times. The Group of Experts is split regarding repeated cyber operations. One view is in line with the ICRC in that each cyber act must be treated separately in terms of direct participation analysis. On the other hand, another view is that it would make more operational sense if direct participation begins with the first cyber operation and continues throughout the period of intermittent activity. The latter view removes the “revolving door” effect and simplifies target ability by making the intermittent activity a singular, start-to-finish cyber operation.\n\nThe Tallinn Experts were also divided over the issue of presumption against direct participation. Recall that the Tallinn Manual provides that in cases where there is doubt as to whether an individual is a civilian, that individual should be treated like a civilian. The policy behind this principle is to ensure that civilians are protected to the utmost extent during armed conflicts. Some Tallinn Experts take this same line of thinking regarding civilians believed to be directly participating in hostilities. These experts believe civilians in this predicament should be given the benefit of the doubt.\nHowever, other Tallinn Experts take the position that when there is doubt as to whether a civilian is directly participating in hostilities, the attacking state must review the relevant information available and act reasonably in the circumstances in determining whether to conduct the attack. The policy behind this method rests in the attacking state’s ability to identify which targets are legal targets based on a reasonable review of the available information. The importance of these two views cannot be understated. Some experts side with protecting civilians to the maximum extent possible, while others favor the States’ ability to act while following LOAC principles.\nAlthough the Tallinn Manual agrees with ICRC Guidance’s requirements of a threshold of harm—a causal link between the action and the harm and a belligerent nexus—generally, the Tallinn Manual’s application of the ICRC’s guidance is a variation of the ICRC’s direct participation in hostilities legal regime involving cyber actions. The Tallinn manual does not have a requirement for physical damage to objects, so actions that may not qualify as cyber-attacks may still satisfy the criterion for the threshold of harm if the action has negatively affected the targeted State. Specifically, the Tallinn Manual provides that a civilian’s\n Id. at Rule 35, comment 12.\n TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 52, at Rule 33.\n Id. at Rule 35, comment 12.\n Id.\n Id.\n See Collin Allan, Direct Participation in Hostilities from Cyberspace, 50 VA. J.

Furthermore, the majority of Tallinn experts agreed that interfering with an object’s functionality would rise to the level of destruction if a physical component must be replaced. Thus, the Tallinn view of the first-prong requirement of the threshold of harm may be seen as lowering the standard for what is required for civilians to be directly participating in hostilities.\nThe Tallinn Manual’s view of the second prong, which is the causal link between the act and the harm likely to result, also differs slightly from the ICRC Guidance. In particular, the Tallinn Manual focuses on the intended harm. By focusing on the intended harm, the Tallinn Manual may be lowering the standard of what is required for a civilian to participate in hostilities by looking at the civilian’s intent, rather than focusing on the likelihood of harm from the cyber operation. For example, a civilian may be directly targeted under the Tallinn Manual view for his role in assembling and storing the cyber equivalent of an IED because the individual intends the same harm as the person arming and detonating it. By comparing the Tallinn Manual’s view with the ICRC Guidance, it is possible that the Tallinn Manual lowers the standards for what is required for civilians to be directly participating in cyber hostilities. Therefore, civilians participating in hostilities through cyber means may be targetable in more situations than under the ICRC framework.\n## V.

That is, they are defined as neither members of the armed forces, which includes groups assimilated to the armed forces such as organized armed groups, nor those participating in a levée en masse. Essentially, all others are considered civilians. Private contractors and employees of a party to an armed conflict who fit the definition of civilians are entitled to protection from being directly targeted, unless they are directly participating in hostilities. In addition, private contractors and civilian employees are not entitled to combatant immunity, as they are not members of the armed force. The activities carried out by contractors and employees as well as their location of duty may expose them to an increased risk of death or injury even if they are not directly participating in hostilities.\n## A. State-Affiliated Civilians\nModern warfare is increasingly dependent upon private contractors and civilian employees to fill a variety of positions traditionally held by military personnel. Generally, these private contractors and civilian employees are considered civilians under the same criteria that would apply to other civilians. That is, they cannot be directly targeted by a party to the armed conflict unless and for so long as they directly participate in hostilities. Due to the special roles of private contractors and civilian employees and their proximity to armed forces in hostilities, parties to an armed conflict must make determinations regarding attacks with particular care and due consideration.\nThe majority of private contractors and civilian employees have been incorporated into State armed forces, but they do not\n---\n See generally TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 52, Rule 29 (quoting the Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 Aug. 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts art. 50, § 1, June 8, 1977, 1125 U.N.T.S. 3).\n Melzer, supra note 90.\n Id. at 38.\n Id. at 37.\n Id.\n Id.\n Id.\n\n[Vol. XLII\nperform functions that would have them directly participate in hostilities. Nevertheless, there are some contractor and civilians filling roles that would put them in situations where they could be seen as directly participating in hostilities. For example, private contractors and civilian employees that defend the base from attack could either be directly participating in hostilities or filling a law enforcement and defense-of-others role.\nEven if they have accompanied armed forces, private contractors and civilians were never meant to (and should never be allowed to) directly participate in hostilities on behalf of a party to a conflict. As long as they are not incorporated into armed forces, private contractors and civilian employees do not cease to be civilians, and they do not lose their civilian protection simply because they accompany armed forces. Moreover, they do not lose their civilian protection just because they assume functions other than conducting hostilities, which traditionally would have been performed by members of armed forces. Contractors and civilian employees who directly participate in hostilities without the express authorization of the party to the armed conflict remain civilians, but they lose their protection from being directly targeted. Contractors and employees can lose their civilian status if they have been incorporated into the armed forces of a party to a conflict. If this happens, the contractors and employees would become members of an organized armed force under the command responsible for the party to the conflict and would no longer qualify as civilians.\n---\n See Melzer, *supra* note 90, at 37 (explaining the basic notion of direct participation in hostilities).\n See *id.* at 44 (illustrating that “[t]he notion of direct participation in hostilities does not refer to a person’s status, function, or affiliation, but to his or her engagement in specific hostile acts”).\n *Id.* at 38.\n *Id.*\n *Id.*\n *Id.*\n See Melzer, *supra* note 90, at 39 (explaining that “[a]s long as they are not incorporated into the armed forces, private contractors and civilian employees do not cease to be civilians simply because they accompany the armed forces and or assume functions other than the conduct of hostilities that would traditionally have been performed by military personnel”).\n *Id.*\n\nThe Tallinn Manual’s international group of experts concurs that individual contractors and civilians may only be directly targeted based on their direct participation in hostilities during an armed conflict. However, there are issues that arise in cyberspace regarding the use of contractors and civilians to perform specific military operations. Unlike traditional warfare, where almost all military operations were carried out by troops and equipment, modern warfare introduces the use of cyber capabilities which conduct a portion of the military operations. An example is the hiring of a private company by a party to an armed conflict that is later contracted to perform specific military operations. Based on the military operations, the company would qualify as an organized armed group belonging to the party to the conflict. Therefore, the civilians employed as private contractors would be considered belonging to the organized armed group. However, even if the civilians were not to be considered as belonging to the organized armed group, they would still only be directly targetable when and if they are directly participating in hostilities.\nCivilian government employees are also employed in positions requiring them to conduct cyber operations during an armed conflict, such as positions within an intelligence agency. If the group of civilians conducting cyber operations qualifies as an organized armed group, the civilian members are subject to attack regardless of direct participation in hostilities. Otherwise, the civilian employees are only directly targetable when they are directly participating in hostilities. As a result, the historic view of citizens carrying out actions typically performed by members of armed forces may be problematic when analyzing the cyber domain construct. The traditional view of warfare holds that private contractors and civilian employees operating in an organized armed group, affiliated with armed forces in an armed conflict, would not be entitled to combatant status.\n\n[Vol. XLII]\nFurthermore, a party to the armed conflict employing civilians to perform intelligence functions, attack execution, or other CNA operations would violate the law of war. The reasoning behind this view is that only members of armed forces or assimilated organizations are granted combatant status because they meet the following conditions: (i) they are commanded by a person responsible for his subordinates; (ii) they have a fixed distinctive emblem recognizable at distance; (iii) they carry arms openly; and (iv) they conduct their operation in accordance with the laws and customs of war. Accordingly, under the traditional view, parties to an armed conflict should employ members of the armed force to carry out CNA functions, and if they desire contractors or civilian employees to fill these roles, then the parties should incorporate them into the regular armed forces.\nDue to the vastly different landscape and operations carried out in cyberspace as opposed to the physical domain, a suggested course of action would be to rely less on the aforementioned four conditions and instead look to state affiliation. The four criteria from the 1874 Brussels Declaration apply perfectly to traditional warfare, but operations in cyberspace are conducted without the need of having a fixed recognizable emblem or of carrying arms openly. By requiring state affiliation for civilian employees, it preserves concern for the principle of distinction in CNA from the Brussels criteria. States employing civilians to conduct cyber operations are less likely to be doing so to prevent the enemy from attacking the civilians. Instead, States are likely taking advantage of the economic, training, and recruiting advantages that develop as a result of not being limited to armed forces filling these behind-the-lines roles. The fact that cyber operations take\nON CYBER CONFLICT, 235, 242 (2012), https://ccdcoe.org/cycon/2012/proceedings/d2r1s10_watts.pdf [https://perma.cc/X6F2-TTRP] [hereinafter Notion of Combatancy].\n Id.\n See id. at 245 (citing the Project of an International Declaration Concerning the Laws and Customs of War, Aug. 27, 1874, 4 Martens Nouveau Recueil (ser. 2) 219 (“1874 Brussels Declaration”)).\n Id.\n Id.\n Id.\n See Notion of Combatancy, supra note 210, at 246.\n Id.\n\nplace far from the battlefield also bolsters the position of state affiliation, because there is no concern that the enemy will be confused regarding distinction in targeting.\nUnder the state affiliation view of civilians taking part in cyber operations, discipline in warfare will continue to be preserved as it is under the four Brussels criteria. Currently, civilians directly participating in hostilities are not subject to the internal military disciplinary system. However, the well-developed legal regimes that prosecute and punish war crimes operate in a manner to vindicate concerns for discipline and humanity. In addition to international enforcement bodies, domestic criminal codes now serve as mechanisms where civilians are equally susceptible to prosecution for any war crimes they have committed. Under the state-affiliation view, States will be able to employ civilians to conduct cyber operations while enabling combatant status. States will also be able to maintain the critically important notions of distinction and discipline as provided under the four Brussels criteria.\nStates employing private contractors and civilian employees do so because of the different landscape and types of operations carried out in cyberspace. As they are written and observed, current LOAC principles, ICRC guidance, and the Tallinn Manual hold that civilians operating in cyberspace in a way that directly participates in hostilities are subject to directly being targeted but are not given combatant immunity. The view of letting state-affiliation drive combatant status determinations for cyberspace operations provides civilians with combatant status, or a version of it, while parties to an armed conflict can still conduct warfare and be no worse off. Currently, parties to an armed conflict operating in cyberspace are left with the difficult task of making determinations regarding direct participation in hostilities by civilians operating anonymously. The state-affiliation view would, at the least, put civilians on notice of what their consequences of participation entail, as well as protect them by\n\n[Vol. XLII]\ngiving them some version of combatant immunity for their actions in armed conflict.\nA comparison of state-affiliated actors versus non-state-affiliated actors may lead to different statuses for each. When viewed as either contractors, who are working on behalf of a State engaged in an international armed conflict, or hacktivists, who operate outside of the control of the State but engage in cyber operations in favor of the State, the statuses of each may be seen as divergent. While neither of the two would qualify for combatant immunity, based on the four requirements provided by the Third Geneva Convention, contractors would have the best shot at being entitled prisoner-of-war (“POW”) status. Due to the nature of their service, contractors accompanying an armed force likely carry identification cards associating them with the armed force. Accordingly, contractors would not be given combatant status, but they would be more likely than hacktivists to be given POW status.\nCivilians accompanying armed forces are afforded some protection, but that protection comes with the inherent danger of accompanying armed forces. State-affiliated civilians qualifying for the narrow category of “civilians accompanying the armed forces” could be eligible for POW status while at the same time also be legitimate military targets for the enemy State. These civilians would likely be performing duties in the functional category of operating and maintaining the cyber operations systems. The civilians filling this state-affiliated role would\n See Logan Liles, *The Civilian Cyber Battlefield: Non-State Cyber Operators’ Status Under the Law of Armed Conflict*, 39 N.C. J.

Their role and location make them possible military targets as well as collateral damage for the enemy State attacking the armed force.\nAnother area of civilian participation in the cyber domain, which remains unresolved, is the participation by civilian scientists specializing in cyberspace. The majority of the participation by a state-affiliated civilian cyber scientist would be viewed as indirect participation. However, there are possible situations where a civilian’s particular expertise could have an exceptional and potentially decisive value for the outcome of an armed conflict. An example would be a computer programmer who researches and writes attack programs, one of which is used to incapacitate the enemy’s network controlling the launch of weapons systems. In this example, the civilian scientist could be responsible for the turning point in the conflict, thus shifting his participation from indirect to direct. The importance of this example is that the State hosting the state-affiliated civilian and the civilian need to understand the possible implications of having the scientist participate, directly or indirectly, in hostilities. Further, the enemy State is going to have to make a call as to whether it can directly target the civilian scientist or attack the military target and consider the scientist collateral damage.\n## B. Non-State-Affiliated Civilians\nNon-state-affiliated civilians, also known as patriotic hackers or hacktivists, are the civilians directly participating in hostilities armed forces’ (presumably those who operate and maintain those systems)—even if they do not actually press the button that launches a cyberattack—are both eligible for prisoner-of-war status and also legitimate military targets for the enemy”).\n *Id.*\n *See id.* at 291–92 (stating that “there is a high probability that many, if not most, of the personnel substantively involved in cyber operations may actually be civilians”).\n *See id.* at 292 (discussing that “[c]omputer technicians, technical maintenance personnel and others who perform similar tasks . . . could thus qualify for inclusion in the limited category of ‘persons who accompany the armed forces without actually being members thereof’”).\n *See id.* at 291 (distinguishing computer programmers who research and write attack programs from operators who execute cyber attacks).\n Turns, *supra* note 62, at 291.\n\n[Vol. XLII]\non their own volition, so they will likely receive no protection under LOAC. These hackers carry out cyber operations against perceived enemy computer systems, without the control or oversight from their government but seek common political ends. Hacktivists would seem to receive no protection due to their direct participation in hostilities; however, hacktivists could arguably be considered participants in a *levée en masse* if they took up arms spontaneously upon the enemy approaching, lack organization, and carried arms openly. If so, hacktivists would be entitled to POW status, but they could be directly targeted while directly participating in hostilities. The LOAC principles have not been updated for cyber operations, so it is difficult to play out exactly how non-state-affiliated civilians are to be treated during international armed conflicts. Ideally, IHL would be universally understood by states engaged in armed conflict and the non-state-affiliated civilians who choose to directly participate in cyber hostilities would be on notice as to how their actions will be measured.\nAlso, made difficult by the landscape and types of operations carried out in cyberspace is the direct targeting of those individuals directly participating. Aside from anonymity being a difficult hurdle in cyberspace, the determination as to whether a physical attack is justified in response to a cyber action is still theoretical. Furthermore, neither treaties nor customary international law have established the illegality of espionage, either in the physical world or in cyberspace. Thus, civilians conducting CNAs on behalf of a State which is party to an armed conflict may not be directly participating in hostilities. Further, customary international law has not recognized data manipulation and deletions as rising to the level of hostilities, so civilians conducting these types of CNAs would not be directly participating in hostilities.\n## VI.

A major concern with this LOAC application is the effect it has on civilians. As the law of war has evolved, the protection of civilians has been one of the key tenets from the outset. The Fourth Geneva Convention sought to protect civilian persons taking no part in hostilities as well as the wounded and sick. The Convention also prohibited an occupying power from destroying real and personal property belonging to civilians. The Additional Protocol I of the Geneva Convention calls for the protection of civilians from unnecessary injury or death and obliges combatants to distinguish themselves from the civilian population while engaged in an attack. The civilian population is specifically protected under Part IV, which demands the parties to at all times distinguish between civilian population and combatants as well as between civilian objects and military objectives. Further, Protocol I prohibits parties from making the civilian population the object of an attack, which also prohibits acts or threats having the intent to terrorize the civilian population.\nThe protections provided by LOAC are two-fold. On one hand, they are meant to inform parties to an armed conflict regarding how to conduct themselves while at war. On the other hand, LOAC provides notice to civilians affected by armed conflict as to the treatment they can expect from the parties to the conflict. The relative nuance of cyberspace operations, as compared to traditional warfare, makes difficult the determination of direct participation in hostilities by citizens. If LOAC principles are incapable of adequately putting parties to armed conflict and citizens on notice, it should be amended for this purpose.\n Geneva Convention, supra note 2, art. 15.\n Id.\n Id. art. 44.\n Protocol I, supra note 1, art. 48.\n Id. art. 51.\n\n[Vol. XLII\n## A. Temporal Considerations in the Cyber Domain\nDirect participation in hostilities by civilians operating in the cyber domain is vastly different than participation in the physical domain due to temporal considerations. Actions taken in cyberspace are not easily detected as they are happening, and they are often created for use in the future. For example, computer network attacks involve the use of malicious code to either infect an enemy’s computer system or to exploit weaknesses in the software, system configuration, or security practices. Additionally, bots and even botnets are remotely-controlled or semi-autonomous computer programs that infect computers and systems to transmit data obtained by the system or instruct the system to operate a certain way. Hackers have even designed ways to exploit computers and systems in a way to launch programs anonymously and autonomously from thousands of infected computers. Accordingly, cyber operations differ greatly from physical operations due to the timing of how the operations are carried out. Cyber operations can be set to take place at a certain time in the future or after a certain event has occurred.\nThe ICRC Guidance and the Tallinn Manual both touch on these temporal considerations. The ICRC provides that preparatory acts can be treated as separate acts and distinguished from the act that is the object of the direct participation in hostilities. Therefore, a civilian participating in hostilities may\n See WILSON, supra note 163, at 39 (explaining the characteristics of malicious code).\n Id. at 38 (explaining that “[a]utomated programs, or ‘bots’ . . . are increasingly autonomous, rapid, and difficult to detect . . . [and] can be remotely controlled by commands sent through the Internet and can be activated to operate in a coordinated manner on thousands of computers in different locations around the world”); see id. at 41 (explaining that “[s]ome compromised computers become part of an automatic ‘bot network,’ quietly performing espionage by transmitting data or intermediate preparatory instructions back and forth between compromised computers while awaiting a special final activation signal originating from the attacker”).\n See id. at 43 (explaining that “hackers have also designed recent computer exploits that launch anonymously from thousands of infected computers to produce waves of disruption that can quickly overwhelm a targeted organization, or multiple organizations such as a list of banking institutions”).\n See Melzer, supra note 90, at 68 (stating that “[w]here the execution of a hostile act does not require geographic displacement, as may be the case with computer network attacks or remote-controlled weapons systems, the duration of direct participation in\n\nconduct a series of acts, each directly participating in hostilities, over a period of time that lead up to the object of the direct participation. The Tallinn Manual provides that the scope of direct participation includes the actions immediately preceding and those subsequent to the qualifying act of direct participation in hostilities. The majority of the Tallinn Experts agree that a civilian is directly targetable only for the duration of the direct participation in hostilities, regardless of when the actual effects are realized. Yet, some of the experts take the position that the time period during which a civilian can be directly targeted extends for as long as there is a causal link to the intended harm. That is, a civilian is targetable as far upstream and as far downstream as that civilian’s causal link exists between the action taken and the intended harm. As an example, a civilian may be targeted as early as when he begins a cyber operation by probing the enemy’s system and carry through to when he conducts the cyber operation against the system. The civilian may even be targeted after the cyber operation, when he is conducting a damage assessment and determining whether to conduct another operation against the system.\nThese temporal considerations are worth exploring because they mostly exist only in the cyber context. Accordingly, there may be a disconnect between how States view cyber operations versus operations in the physical world due to the way LOAC principles were developed for the physical world. Though it is possible to parallel these temporal considerations by discussing IEDs emplaced for the destruction of the enemy State’s equipment and the injury of its people, there is not a precise match. While IEDs can be emplaced with the intent of them going off in the future upon being activated, IEDs with this setup cannot be controlled and changed like their logic bomb counterpart in the cyber world. Applying LOAC principles to an IED would yield\n TALLINN MANUAL, *supra* note 52, at Rule 35, comment 7.\n *Id.* at Rule 35, comment 8.\n *Id.* at Rule 35, comment 7.\n *Id.*\n *Id.*\n *Id.*\n\n[Vol. XLII\nthe bomb maker likely being targetable while building the bomb, based on his intent, and the civilian emplacing the IED being targetable while emplacing the IED. It would not be as clean cut in the cyber world based on the ability of the logic bomb builder and the one who activates it to carry out the entire operation in complete anonymity as well as being able to control the logic bomb once it is emplaced.\nFor the sake of clarifying the discussion below, the civilians being discussed are non-state-affiliated civilians. State-affiliated civilians are those who operate as either private contractors on behalf of the State or as civilian employees, who are employed by the State. These civilians are better aware of their exposure to direct attack based on the nature of their service, which could include operational as well as geographic proximity to armed forces. Thus, the State and the state-affiliated civilians are on notice as to whether and for how long the civilians may be directly targeted by the opposing state during an armed conflict.\nAdditional Protocol I provides that civilians and civilian populations enjoy general protection against dangers arising from military operations. However, civilians forfeit this protection if and for so long as they directly participate in hostilities. Direct participation by civilians in cyberspace is not always clear. The International Group of Experts was split regarding repeated cyber operations by civilians that qualified as direct participation in hostilities. Some of the experts side with ICRC guidance, which provides that each act must be treated separately as separate acts of direct participation. Other experts conclude separate direct participation analysis made little operational sense and believe it would create a “revolving door” effect regarding targetability. This group of experts believes direct participation by the civilian begins with the first cyber operation he participates in and continues throughout the period of intermittent activity. This incongruent application of existing LOAC principles on cyberspace operations demonstrates the potential for civilians and\n Protocol I, supra note 1, art. 51.\n Id.\n TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 52, Rule 35, comment 7.\n Id.\n Id.\n Id.\n\nparties to an armed conflict to misapply or misinterpret LOAC principles.\nWhat if a non-state-affiliated civilian were to create an autonomous logic bomb and release it with the intent to infiltrate and attack the computer network of the defense ministry of a State which is party to an ongoing armed conflict? At what point could the civilian be targeted by the State? If the State discovers the logic bomb months after it was released by the civilian, and assuming the State can attribute it to the civilian, can the State target the civilian then? Under ICRC guidance, the civilian could be directly targeted for each act of direct participation in hostilities. Accordingly, the civilian could be directly attacked when producing the logic bomb with the intent to launch a CNA against the State, if done so in support of another party to the conflict, and when the civilian actually launches the logic bomb. However, ICRC guidance would not likely support a direct attack against the civilian if discovered months after it was launched. Under the Tallinn Manual’s viewpoint, the civilian may be directly targeted.\nAs discussed above, it may be unclear to civilians directly participating in hostilities in the cyber domain as to how their actions could be interpreted by parties to an armed conflict. Aside from civilians conducting intermittent direct participation in hostilities in cyberspace, civilians may also be unclear as to their exposure for direct targeting due to the uncertain application of LOAC principles to the cyber domain. Specifically, civilians launching autonomous or semi-autonomous programs to attack computer networks may directly participate in hostilities by building the code and program for the specific purpose as well as directly participate by launching the CNA. However, these civilians may at some point decide they no longer wish to pursue the action against a party to an armed conflict.\n JEAN-MARIE HENCKAERTS &amp; LOUISE DOSWALD-BECK, CUSTOMARY INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW VOL. 1: RULES 1, 21 (2005).\n Id.\n Id. at 23.\n Turns, supra note 62, at 281.\n\n[Vol. XLII\n## B. Change of Heart for Civilians Directly Participating in Cyber Hostilities\nHow might a civilian make clear to a State embroiled in an armed conflict that the civilian who conducted a cyber operation against the State no longer wishes to directly participate in cyber hostilities? In the physical domain, the civilian would simply stop shooting at the party, collecting arms to use against the party, building bombs to emplace in roadways, or collecting money to finance attacks against the party to the conflict. An example which could parallel the cyber domain would be a civilian bomb maker who makes a bomb and emplaces that bomb in a road in an effort to target a party to an armed conflict. However, the bomb maker could make clear his intentions to no longer directly participate by putting up a sign warning of the bomb, digging up the bomb, or telling the party the location of the bomb. In cyberspace, a civilian who creates the malicious code for the CNA and launches it may not be able to recall the code or stop the cyber operation once it has begun. Once the malicious code is discovered, the targeted State may attack the civilian because it is impossible to precisely determine if the civilian has stopped directly participating in cyber hostilities. The State could argue the civilian is still monitoring and directing the logic bomb or malicious code.\nThe advanced technology which enables civilians to directly participate in hostilities could make it difficult for both the civilian and the party to the armed conflict to know when the civilian is no longer directly participating. The civilian who produces the malicious code for a CNA concludes his direct participation when he stops working on or even finishes the code. Would the civilian who launches the malicious code for a CNA conclude his direct participation when the code is launched? What if the malicious code were autonomous or semi-autonomous, and it would continue to operate without the aid from the civilian? This would seem to be a magic bullet fired in the physical world. In the physical domain, the bullet would lose speed and fall to the earth. However, malicious code launched in the cyber domain may\n *Id.*\n *Id.*\n *Id.*\n\ncontinue until it is discovered and counter by the attacked party or until it reaches its termination stage, if it has one. May the civilian launching this code be directly targeted until the malicious code ceases to operate as part of the CNA?\nCurrent interpretations by the ICRC and the International Group of Experts contributing to the Tallinn Manual apply IHL to the cyber domain and determine that the civilian launching the CNA code can only be targeted so long as he is directly participating in hostilities, which is when he is actively engaged. The ICRC and the Group of Experts are unwilling to extend the window of targetability to include ongoing hostilities set in motion by the individual unleashing the malicious code aimed at conducting a CNA. As previously stated in the magic bullet analogy, there is nothing to stop the CNA code except for the initiator, unless the attacked State becomes aware of the CNA and takes steps to defend against it. Accordingly, should not the attacked State be able to target the civilian initiator after he has set in motion the CNA? If the State is able to stretch the targetability window to legally target the initiating civilian so long as the CNA is underway, can the civilian limit his exposure in any way?\nA solution might be found in the American Law Institute’s Model Penal Code (“MPC”). The MPC defines criminal conspiracy as a person conspiring with another person or group of persons to commit a crime if the individual, with the purpose of promoting or facilitating the crime: 1) agrees with the other person or group that one or more of them will engage in conduct constituting a crime; or 2) agrees to aid the other person or group in planning or committing the crime. However, the actor may, after having conspired to commit a crime, use as an affirmative defense the fact that the actor thwarted the success of the conspiracy after having manifested a complete and voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose. By renouncing his support for the crime and thwarting the success of the conspiracy, the actor is able to undo the effort he put into conspiring to commit the crime.\n Eva Knopova, *New IHL Framework for Cyber Warfare: Master’s Thesis*, CHARLES UNIV. PRAGUE DEP’T INT’L L. 47 (2016).\n Id.\n American Law Institute, *MODEL PENAL CODE § 5.03* (Tent. Draft No. 4, 1955).\n Id.\n\n[Vol. XLII]\nAs applied to the above issue regarding civilians directly participating in cyber hostilities, a civilian putting into place malicious code capable of autonomously conducting a CNA may be able to be certain he cannot be directly targeted by the party to an armed conflict by renouncing his support for the cyber hostilities and working to thwart further cyber hostilities by the code. By attempting to prevent future direct targeting, the civilian may inadvertently leave himself exposed to attack by making his actions and identity known to the party. However, a party to an armed conflict abiding by LOAC would not be able to target a civilian who is no longer participating in hostilities. Further, the civilian may take similar actions to renounce his participation and thwart further action by the code in an anonymous way.\nBy adopting this view, States who are a party to an armed conflict have better ground rules as to how to legally target non-state-affiliated civilians who are participating in cyber hostilities in a way that may not be covered by current IHL. Additionally, under this view, civilians will have a better understanding of how their actions, carried out as cyber operations, will be treated by States who are a party to an armed conflict. This view provides States and civilians with notice of how actions by civilians will be treated in cyberspace. Further, this view provides civilians who have participated in cyber hostilities, and who may be determined to be still participating based on the autonomous CNA code the individual initiated, an opportunity to remove themselves from hostilities. By taking steps discussed in the MPC to remove oneself from a conspiracy, the initiating individual can undo the bonds currently opening himself up to being targeted by a party to the conflict.\nBy coming forward, renouncing his support for the ongoing cyber hostilities, and attempting to thwart the object of the cyber\n HENCKAERTS &amp; DOSWALD-BECK, supra note 260, at 19–20.\n See generally INT’L &amp; OPERATIONAL L.

[n]on-combatants, including civilians and persons out of combat, may not intentionally be targeted”).\n HENCKAERTS &amp; DOSWALD-BECK, supra note 260, at 19–20.\n American Law Institute, supra note 269.\n\noperation, a civilian may prevent the targeted State from directly targeting the civilian. However, the civilian may also be creating an unexpected repercussion. The civilian directly taking part in cyber hostilities, favoring a party to an armed conflict by conducting cyber operations against an opponent party, also exposes himself to domestic criminal law pertaining to the cyber operations. By coming forward, the civilian may be opening himself up to prosecution under domestic criminal law in an effort to prevent being directly targeted by the State against whom the civilian directly participated in hostilities. This may create a disincentive for civilians to expose themselves as ongoing direct participants in cyber hostilities, but the damage is already done.\nThe only question that remains is attribution. Can the attacked State determine who the civilian is for either direct targeting purposes or domestic criminal prosecution? If the civilian believes so, the civilian could limit his exposure to being directly attacked as well as request leniency from the domestic criminal prosecution for his cooperation. The alternative is for the civilian to figure out a way to completely remove every trace of his participation in an ongoing cyber operation, thereby ensuring the attacked State does not discover the cyber operation, attribute it to the civilian, and directly attack him.\nWithout this possible outlet, civilians who have had a change of heart and no longer wish to participate in cyber hostilities may be targeted in the future for previous participation in cyber hostilities, of which they no longer wish to be a part. Though not a perfect method for keeping civilians safe from being directly targeted, this method provides notice to the attacking State of the civilian’s previous acts, which are the acts the civilian no longer wishes to be held accountable for in the realm of armed conflict. The civilian’s renouncing of previous participation in hostilities will not absolve him of domestic law implications, but it will ensure he is not targeted in the future.\n\n[Vol. XLII]\n# VII. Conclusion\nCivilians directly participate in hostilities for numerous reasons. State-affiliated civilians might engage in direct participation as part of their job; non-state-affiliated civilians might directly participate out of a sense of patriotism, helping the underdog, or feeling like part of the fight. Cyberspace creates an environment unlike any other ever seen before, so civilians and States who are a party to an armed conflict struggle to understand how LOAC principles apply to their conduct. A misunderstanding by a civilian could lead to a prolonged period of being directly targeted by a party to a conflict; a misunderstanding by that party could lead to allegations of war crimes. All sides to a conflict, to include civilians, would benefit from consensus in the application of LOAC to the cyber domain.\nA consensus in the application of LOAC principles in the cyber domain could lead to stronger footing for States and citizens as the cyberspace domain becomes a larger battleground. Cyberspace issues such as anonymity, attribution, temporal considerations, and equal application of force between the physical and cyber domains all highlight the need to better define LOAC applications to the cyber domain. Specifically, civilians should be able to renounce their direct participation in cyber hostilities, and they should no longer face direct targeting by a party to a conflict for cyber operations taken previously. The Tallinn Manual spells out that civilians may be directly targeted so long as their causal link to the action exists. States subscribing to this view may link civilians to cyber operations carried out previously, even after civilians have walked away and no longer desire to directly participate.\nThe ability to target civilians for previous acts of cyber hostilities when States believe a causal link still exists may lead to an expanded window of time during which a civilian may be targeted. Thus, States who are party to a conflict should be able to know with certainty that the civilian they intend to target is a lawful target, due to the civilian’s ongoing intent to directly participate in hostilities. The renunciation clause found in the Model Penal Code could be the solution to ending\n Turns, supra note 62, at 281.\n Id.\n\nmisunderstandings by civilians and parties to a conflict regarding direct participation and targeting.\nUnder this view, civilians have a way to guarantee they will no longer be directly targeted for past cyber operations amounting to direct participation in hostilities when the State may not know the civilian’s participation has concluded. In addition, this view provides an out for States directly targeting civilians for directly participating in cyber hostilities against the State because the civilian has the opportunity and incentive to come clean if the civilian no longer wishes to directly participate. By coming forward, civilians may open themselves up to domestic prosecution, but they guarantee they will not be directly targeted by a State.\nA final point is examined by asking: should civilians have to go to such lengths to ensure they will not be directly targeted by a State for previous instances of direct participation in hostilities? Further, should LOAC require citizens to take active steps to put States on notice as to the citizens’ activities to prevent being illegally targeted after the direct participation in hostilities has concluded? An argument can be made that this policy would be requiring too much of civilians, and it exposes civilians to a lose-lose scenario.\nOn the one hand, civilians want to ensure the temporal anomalies in the cyber domain do not mislead States into falsely believing civilians are continuing to directly participate in hostilities after participation has ended. On the other, civilians want to protect against domestic prosecution and initiating an investigation into their activities. Though a possible solution to the issue of civilians being overly or illegally targeted could be found in the Model Penal Code, international law may not be willing to support the process or potential side effects to civilians providing notice to States that the civilians have withdrawn from the direct participation in hostilities.\n\n^{}[]"

Introduction\nThe Law of Armed Conflict (“LOAC”) has evolved over the past century and a half to protect civilians from the harms caused by war as well as to put all parties on notice as to their expected conduct. Civilians, like any other group, are not prohibited from directly participating in hostilities, but they lose their protection from being directly targeted for such time as they chose to do so.¹ This protection for civilians is easier understood as it is applied to the physical domain, for which it was created. The cyber domain is vastly different. Accordingly, civilians and States who are party to international armed conflicts are left to apply their own understanding of how LOAC principles should be applied to the cyber domain.\nThe difference of interpretation by civilians and parties to armed conflict could leave civilians overly exposed to direct attack and parties accountable for war crimes. This is especially true for non-state-affiliated civilians conducting cyber hostilities against a State that is party to an armed conflict. The differentiation between state-affiliated and non-state-affiliated civilians matters, because state-affiliated civilians should understand they may be injured or killed based on their work alongside and their proximity to armed forces. Thus, they are likely on notice that they may be directly targeted if directly participating in hostilities as well as considered collateral damage during a legal attack by an enemy State. In addition, civilians may open themselves up to an extended period of time during which they may be directly targeted based on the type of cyber operation they conduct.\nVarying views support the notion that civilians intermittently participating directly in hostilities may be targeted throughout a linked-together period of participation. Further, if a civilian were to launch against a State a cyber operation that activates at a set point in the future or after a forecasted event, the State could possibly treat the civilian as directly participating in hostilities long after the civilian actually initiated and participated in the cyber operation. This delayed direct targeting of the civilian can happen either because the State is unaware of exactly when the cyber operation was launched against it or because it interprets its\n¹ Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts, June 8, 1977, 110 Stat. 2104, 1125 U.N.T.S. 51 [hereinafter Protocol I].\n2017 THE TARGETING OF NON-STATE-AFFILIATED CIVILIANS 1015\nresponse as warranted under LOAC.\nAlong with opening themselves up to being directly targeted, civilians participating in cyber hostilities may also face domestic criminal law exposure for their cyber hostilities. States that are party to an armed conflict could seek to lawfully target the civilian rather than await a domestic law prosecution. A possible solution to civilians being overly exposed to direct attack for their decision to directly participate in cyber hostilities could come from the Model Penal Code’s view of renouncing one’s role and thwarting the overall success of the act. Under this theory, a civilian could make the enemy State aware of the civilian’s plot to conduct an ongoing cyber operation against the State in an effort to absolve the civilian of being targeted in the future. However, these civilians may still face domestic criminal law repercussions for doing so.\n## II. The Treatment of Civilians in Traditional Warfare\nWhether it is their own loss of life or injury, the loss or injury of a relative, or the collateral damage of their property, civilians always suffer during war. Accordingly, major nation states have been working together for over a century to address the way traditional wars are fought, and they have sought to add a sense of humanity and require discrimination in targeting. In 1949, major nation states acceded to the Fourth Geneva Convention, which was called “The Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War” and sought to protect noncombatants.²\nPrior to the Geneva Conventions, civilians were left to the mercy of the combatants and their beliefs as to sparing civilians.³ The Geneva Conventions codified what had been inching closer to customary law for decades.⁴ The movement in this direction can be seen by the Lieber Code, which sought to regulate war; and later the Declaration of St. Petersburg in 1868, which prohibited the use of specific weapons for humanitarian reasons.⁵ The\n² Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, Aug. 12, 1949, 110 Stat. 2104, 75 U.N.T.S. 287 [hereinafter Geneva Convention].\n³ See ANICÉE VAN ENGELAND, CIVILIAN OR COMBATANT?: A CHALLENGE FOR THE 21ST CENTURY ix-xix (2011).\n⁴ Id.\n⁵ Id. at 13–14.\n1016\nN.C. J. INT'L L.\n[Vol. XLII]\ninternational agreement formed at the 1874 Brussels Convention discussed laws and customs of war and provided that combatant forces are not granted unlimited power as to how to injure the enemy.⁶ This provision was later codified in the Hague Regulations of 1907, as was the general understanding of the need for discrimination between civilians and combatants.⁷ Additionally, the Hague Peace Conferences of 1899 and 1907 became the first internationally codified documents providing that civilians should not suffer from the effects of hostilities.⁸\n## A. Geneva Convention and the Additional Protocol\nThe Fourth Geneva Convention, which occurred in 1949, specifically sought to protect civilians during times of war.⁹ Under the Fourth Geneva Convention, persons taking no active part in the hostilities are to be treated humanely and without regard to their faith, sex, race, or religion.¹⁰ In addition, parties to the conflict are to establish neutral zones in regions of combat to shelter wounded and sick combatants and civilians taking no part in hostilities from the effects of war.¹¹ The wounded and the sick are specifically protected and should be provided particular care and respect.¹²\nIn addition to the Fourth Geneva Convention, the Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (“Additional Protocol I”) is a 1977 amendment to the Geneva Convention that focuses on the protection of victims of international armed conflicts.¹³ Protocol I calls for the protection and care of the wounded, sick, and shipwrecked regardless of whether they are military or civilians.¹⁴ To protect civilians from unnecessary injury or death, Protocol I obliges combatants to distinguish themselves from the civilian population while engaged\n⁶ *Id.*\n⁷ *Id.*\n⁸ *Id.*\n⁹ See Geneva Convention, *supra* note 2.\n¹⁰ *Id.* art. 3.\n¹¹ *Id.* art. 14.\n¹² *Id.*\n¹³ Protocol I, *supra* note 1, art. 3.\n¹⁴ *Id.*\n2017 THE TARGETING OF NON-STATE-AFFILIATED CIVILIANS 1017\nin an attack.¹⁵ The civilian population is specifically protected under Part IV, which demands the parties to distinguish at all times between civilian populations and combatants; as well as between civilian objects and military objectives.¹⁶ Further, Protocol I provides that if there is doubt as to whether a person is a civilian, that person should be treated as a civilian.¹⁷ In addition, parties are prohibited from making the civilian population the object of an attack, or making acts or threats intended to terrorize the civilian population.¹⁸\nProtocol I also protects civilians by prohibiting indiscriminate attacks such as those not directed at a specific military objective as well as the use of combat means that cannot be sufficiently limited.¹⁹ However, there are limits because the presence or movement of civilians will not render certain areas immune from military operations.²⁰ For example, if a party to the conflict uses a movement of civilians to shield military objects, that party would be in violation of the Protocol. The purpose of the Additional Protocol is to protect civilians during armed conflicts, so a State using civilians as shields will be held accountable for the LOAC violation. In addition, the Hague Convention states that the right of belligerents to adopt means of injuring the enemy is not unlimited.²¹ By limiting the means used against the enemy, civilians are also protected from unnecessary suffering due to the type of weapons used in warfare.²² The purpose of the Hague Convention was to infuse humanity into armed conflicts.²³ By forcing States to use approved weapons, which take into account human suffering, civilians are indirectly protected from inhumane weaponry.\nProtocol I requires precautionary measures to be taken during\n15 Id. art. 44.\n16 Id. art. 48.\n17 Id. art. 50.\n18 Id. art. 48.\n19 Protocol I, supra note 12, art. 51.\n20 Id.\n21 Convention (IV) Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land and its Annex: Regulations Concerning the Laws and Customs of War on Land art. 22, Oct. 18, 1907, 36 Stat. 2277, U.N.T.S. 277.\n22 Id.\n23 Id.\n1018\nN.C.

Civilians Directly Participating in Hostilities\nProtocol I protects civilians when viewed as innocent bystanders, but what if civilians participate in hostilities? Under the Protocol, parties to an international armed conflict may only target civilians for such time as the civilians take a direct part in hostilities.³¹ At that point, the civilians lose their civilian status protection and can then be targeted by combatants as legally permissible. The timeframe for which civilians can be targeted while directly participating in hostilities is defined by Protocol I as the time during which they are participating.³² However, it is important to keep in mind that the right of the noncombatant population to protection involves a corresponding duty to abstain\n24 Protocol I, supra note 1, art. 57.\n25 Id.\n26 Id.\n27 Id.\n28 Id. art. 58.\n29 Id. art. 57.\n30 Protocol I, supra note 1, art. 57.\n31 Id. art. 51.\n32 Id.\n2017 THE TARGETING OF NON-STATE-AFFILIATED CIVILIANS 1019\nfrom hostilities.³³\nAs an example, if a civilian who is caught in the middle of an international armed conflict decides to pick up a rifle and shoot at a Party to the conflict, the Party’s armed force may target the civilian so long as the civilian poses a threat. If the civilian were to drop the rifle and run back to his house, he could no longer be targeted by the armed force. The targeting of civilians while directly participating in hostilities is rooted in LOAC; any potential domestic law violations would be determined by the civilian’s State. Civilians directly participating in hostilities may face repercussions based on their actions that violate domestic criminal laws as well as being targeted by the enemy State. The Third Geneva Convention also addresses civilians participating in hostilities.\nThe Third Geneva Convention (“Convention”) was adopted in 1949, and its purpose was the protection of the victims of war, both civilian and prisoner.³⁴ This Convention mainly addresses the treatment of prisoners of war, but it also recognizes civilian participation in hostilities.³⁵ Under this Convention, *levée en masse* is the spontaneous taking up of arms by civilian inhabitants of a non-occupied territory when the invading enemy approaches.³⁶ In this case, the civilians would be allowed prisoner-of-war status because they participated in hostilities spontaneously, without the time to form themselves into regular armed units; but they must carry arms openly and respect the laws of war.³⁷ Aside from prisoner of war status, LOAC also addresses combatant immunity and targetability.³⁸\nCombatant immunity is addressed in Protocol I, wherein it states that members of a Party’s armed force are combatants, and\n³³ Karma Nabulsi, *Evolving Conceptions of Civilians and Belligerents: One Hundred Years After the Hague Peace Conferences, in CIVILIANS IN WAR 9, 16* (Simon Chesterman ed., 2001) (quoting Henry Richmond Droop, *On the Relations Between an Invading Army and the Inhabitants, and the Conditions Under Which Irregular Troops Are Entitled to the Same Treatment as Regular Soldiers*, TRANSACTIONS OF THE GROTIUS SOCIETY 713 (1871)).\n³⁴ Geneva Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War art. 4, Aug. 12, 1949, 6 U.S.T. 3316, 75 U.N.T.S. 135 [hereinafter Geneva POW].\n³⁵ *Id.*\n³⁶ *Id.*\n³⁷ *Id.*\n³⁸ See Protocol I, supra note 1.\n1020\nN.C. J. INT'L L.\n[Vol. XLII]\nthey have the right to participate directly in hostilities.³⁹ The term “combatant” excludes medical personnel, chaplains, and civilians.⁴⁰ Accordingly, in international armed conflict, combatants enjoy immunity regarding their acts as part of hostilities, but it does not prohibit others from engaging in those types of hostilities. Although non-combatants are not specifically prohibited from engaging in hostilities during an armed conflict, they may be directly targeted by the enemy and may face domestic criminal charges for their actions. Therefore, civilians engaging in hostilities would not be entitled to the combatant immunity that is given to combatants participating in an international armed conflict. Thus, civilians would only be entitled to prisoner of war status in limited cases, and they would not be entitled to combatant immunity.\nRegarding targetability, civilians are not to be targeted by the parties to an armed conflict, and civilians are to be generally protected against the dangers arising from military operations.⁴¹ However, LOAC allows civilians to be targeted by an armed force if and for so long as the civilian is directly participating in hostilities.⁴² Therefore, civilians enjoy the freedom from targetability so long as they are not taking a direct part in the hostilities. This freedom from direct targetability extends to a point under LOAC. A State choosing to target a legal military objective must determine if civilians and their property may be damaged by the attack.⁴³ If so, the State must conduct a balancing test to ensure the necessity of taking out the military objective outweighs the possible damage that could be caused to civilians and their property.⁴⁴ In summation, civilians do not have combatant immunity, they may be granted prisoner of war status during a levée en masse, and they cannot be directly targeted unless they are directly participating in hostilities.⁴⁵\nEven with the existence of International Humanitarian Law (“IHL”) seeking to protect civilians during times of war, civilians\n39 Id. art. 43.\n40 Id.\n41 Id. art. 51.\n42 Id.\n43 Geneva POW, supra note 34, art. 4.\n44 Id.\n45 Id.\n2017 THE TARGETING OF NON-STATE-AFFILIATED CIVILIANS 1021\nstill experience loss. IHL exists with the purpose of protecting civilians during an ongoing armed conflict, but civilians can still be legally killed or injured.⁴⁶ If done according to the Geneva Conventions’ rules of discrimination and proportionality, nations may still strike enemy targets that lead to the loss of limbs, lives, and loved ones for civilians.⁴⁷ As examples, fighter jets can strike a weapons cache next to an apartment complex, a convoy can speed through a school playground,⁴⁸ and combatants can return fire in a crowded street. Aside from a country’s stance on ethics in times of war, the plight of civilians has practical drawbacks, such as the hatred survivors have toward foreign governments and protests following civilian casualties.⁴⁹ The United States military came to understand that it is important to win the hearts and minds of the civilian population in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.⁵⁰ Based on the implications that the United States was callously indifferent regarding civilian casualties, it started tracking the damage it caused and responded directly to affected families.⁵¹ The efforts by the U.S. government to recognize the importance of paying respect to the families of injured or killed civilians is another step toward protecting civilians during times of war.\nInternational Humanitarian Law provides the basis for the protection of civilians during an ongoing armed conflict, but does that translate from the physical world to the cyber world? The cyberspace domain offers capabilities that are far different from the physical domain. Cyberspace provides the cloak of anonymity that may shield civilians and even States from being identified as the responsible party for cyber operations. The protections afforded to civilians have been roughly translated from the physical to the cyber domain by the Tallinn Manual’s International Group of Experts as well as Guidance by the International Committee of the Red Cross.\n### III. The Current Treatment of Civilians in the Cyberspace\n⁴⁶ *Id.*\n⁴⁷ Sarah Holewinski, *Do Less Harm: Protecting and Compensating Civilians in War*, FOREIGN AFF., Jan.–Feb. 2013, at 14.\n⁴⁸ *Id.*\n⁴⁹ *Id.*\n⁵⁰ *Id.*\n⁵¹ *Id.*\n1022\nN.C. J. INT'L L.\n[Vol. XLII\n## Domain\nCivilians enjoy very much the same protections in the cyberspace domain as they do in the physical domain. The Tallinn Manual states that civilians are defined in the cyberspace domain as they are under the Additional Protocol I of the Geneva Convention.⁵² Specifically, civilians are defined in terms of neither being members of armed forces nor members of a *levée en masse*.⁵³ As such, individual civilians, as well as civilian populations, shall not be the object of a cyber-attack by a party to the armed conflict.⁵⁴ A cyber-attack is any cyber operation or activity that is reasonably expected to cause injury or death to a person or the damage or destruction to objects.⁵⁵ In addition, LOAC applies to the targeting of people or objects during an armed conflict regardless of the means or methods of warfare that are used.⁵⁶ These seemingly broad definitions are key to protecting civilians during armed conflicts because parties to the conflict are held accountable for actions taken which are incompatible with the law of war.\n## A. Cyber Operations and the Law of Armed Conflict\nDefining cyber warfare, as a whole, is better understood by looking at its component parts. Cyberspace, in general, is the domain within the information environment made up of the interdependent network of information technology infrastructures and the resident data.⁵⁷ Cyber warfare can be viewed as a combined concept of cyberspace operations, offensive cyberspace operations, and defensive cyberspace operations.⁵⁸ Cyber operations are the employment of cyberspace capabilities where the primary purpose is to achieve objectives in and through\n⁵² TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE 104-05 (Michael N.

To do so, States conduct network reconnaissance for both operational requirements, as well as to ensure planned attacks do not cause collateral damage and casualties outside of what is acceptable under LOAC principles.⁶⁶\n⁵⁹ Id.\n⁶⁰ Id.\n⁶¹ Id.\n⁶² David Turns, *Cyber Warfare and the Notion of Direct Participation in Hostilities*, 17 J.

INT'L L.\n[Vol. XLII\nThere are some scholars and experts who view cyber operations as falling outside of the reach of the UN Charter or LOAC. Due to the UN Charter being written long before the advent of the Internet, the UN Charter was not written with a clear intention of including cyber operations.⁶⁷ Scholars and experts adhering to this view believe the UN Charter encompasses only physical attacks, and cyber operations will almost certainly not involve the use of physical force.⁶⁸ According to this line of thought, a country would not violate LOAC by deliberately launching cyber operations at civilian-owned targets.⁶⁹ However, the Tallinn Manual examines cyber operations as falling under the UN Charter and being subject to LOAC.⁷⁰\nThe LOAC principle of distinction, as codified in Additional Protocol I, and incorporated into the Tallinn Manual, requires that parties to an armed conflict distinguish between the civilian population and combatants, as well as between civilian objects and military objectives.⁷¹ This requirement seeks to protect civilians and their property by holding the parties to armed conflict accountable for the targets they choose to attack. Further, the principle of distinction precludes any rationale or justification by a party for an attack not permitted by LOAC.⁷² In cases where there is doubt as to whether a person is a civilian in the cyber domain, that person shall be considered a civilian.⁷³ This requirement complicates the cyber battlefield, because there are many civilians using computers and computer networks, and it may be very difficult to discern who is and is not a civilian.\nDetermining whether actors in the cyberspace domain are civilians, and may possibly be targeted when directly participating in hostilities during an international armed conflict, is difficult. Inaccurate attribution in cyberspace may leave vulnerable the civilians caught in the crossfire. The International Court of Justice maintains high standards for requisite attribution of an armed attack, and in the cyber domain, attribution for the act and actor\n⁶⁷ See Cyber, supra note 57.\n⁶⁸ Id.\n⁶⁹ Id.\n⁷⁰ See TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 52.\n⁷¹ Geneva Convention, supra note 2, art. 14; Geneva POW, supra note 34, art. 4.\n⁷² TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 52, at Rule 33.\n⁷³ Id.\n2017 THE TARGETING OF NON-STATE-AFFILIATED CIVILIANS 1025\nare difficult to prove with scientific certainty.⁷⁴ Further, this attribution on the Internet is “the most technologically challenging level of attribution,” because the attributing party is seeking “to determine the original individual or entity that is responsible for launching the attack.”⁷⁵\nIn the United States, the White House, State Department, and Department of Defense recognize the need to treat cyber operations as potentially falling under the UN Charter and requiring a LOAC determination prior to employment.⁷⁶ Specifically, there is concern from these agencies that the use of cyber weapons could trigger unintended consequences and might harm diplomatic relations.⁷⁷ Senior military officials have stated that attribution of cyber-attacks has remained a challenge, and that challenge factors into the difficulty of determining what constitutes a cyber act of war.⁷⁸ Further, the National Security Director and U.S. Cyber Command chief has stated that the United States needs to think outside of the cyber realm regarding retaliation, and it needs to define acceptability limits regarding hacking.⁷⁹ In addition, the United States needs to prepare a set of capabilities and show its determination for using them.⁸⁰ Members of the U.S. Congress have echoed the need for cyber deterrence\n⁷⁴ See Jason F.

INT'L L.\n[Vol. XLII\nand state that in order for cyber deterrence to work, there needs to be an established policy in place to put other countries on notice as to what response to expect from the United States.⁸¹\nThe U.S. stance regarding cyber operations and LOAC became clearer as senior leaders discussed their take on how the United States operates in the cyber domain.⁸² The National Security Director and Cyber Command Chief has stated that anything the United States does in the cyber arena must follow LOAC, so cyber responses must be proportional and in line with historical norms.⁸³ Further, cyberspace capabilities and operations parallel those in the physical domain, but cyber represents a different technical application in an attempt to achieve some of the exact same effects.⁸⁴ Additionally, the development of cyber weapons represents the next evolutionary step in warfare, so it possesses all of the ethical concerns posed by similar weapons developed in the past.⁸⁵ Therefore, the United States places great importance on maintaining compliance with LOAC even though cyber capabilities and operations were not planned for by the LOAC founders.⁸⁶\n## B. The Objects of Cyber Attacks\nThe Tallinn Manual also discusses who may be made the object of cyber-attacks and lists them as: 1) members of the armed forces; 2) members of organized armed groups; 3) civilians taking a direct part in hostilities; and 4) participants in a *levée en masse* during an international armed conflict.⁸⁷ It should be noted that the first two categories can be made the object of an attack based on their status; however, the last two categories can only be made targets based on their actions.

Inhabitants of unoccupied territory during an international armed conflict who engage in cyber operations as part of a levée en masse are afforded combatant immunity and prisoner of war status.⁹³ In addition, participants in a cyber-based levée en masse are targetable throughout the period of their participation therein.⁹⁴ To be considered a levée en masse, the participating individuals must be inhabitants of non-occupied territory, who upon the invading enemy’s approach, take up arms to resist them.⁹⁵ In the cyber context, “taking up arms” refers to engaging in cyber operations against the enemy.⁹⁶\nThis “taking up arms” in cyberspace is theoretical based on the facts that would have to exist for a cyber levée en masse to be\n⁸⁸ *Id.*\n⁸⁹ *Id.*\n⁹⁰ Nils Melzer, *Interpretive Guidance on the Notion of Direct Participation Under International Humanitarian Law*, INT’L COMM.

The difference is the virtually untested nature of the cyberspace domain. It remains unclear exactly how States are to behave in cyberspace, what rises to the level of a cyber-attack, and what level of physical domain response is authorized for a particular cyber-attack. These and other unresolved translations from the physical realm to the cyber domain make difficult the protection of civilians during an international armed conflict. A step further would be the impact on civilians when they decide to directly participate in cyber hostilities.\n## IV. Civilians Directly Participating in Hostilities in the Cyberspace Domain\nThe Tallinn Manual provides that, based on LOAC principles, there is no bar of any category of person from participating in cyber operations, whether during an international or non-international armed conflict.¹⁰² However, civilians participating in an armed conflict through cyber operations would likely not be entitled to prisoner of war status and combatant immunity, and they could be targeted based on their participation.¹⁰³ The\n⁹⁷ *Id.*\n⁹⁸ Geneva POW, *supra* note 34, art. 4.\n⁹⁹ *Id.*\n¹⁰⁰ *Id.*\n¹⁰¹ *Id.*\n¹⁰² TALLINN MANUAL, *supra* note 52, at Rule 25.\n¹⁰³ *Id.* at Rule 25, comment 2.\n2017 THE TARGETING OF NON-STATE-AFFILIATED CIVILIANS 1029\nentitlement to combatant immunity and prisoner of war status are dependent upon the individual being engaged in an international armed conflict, as opposed to solely a non-international armed conflict or actions not rising to the level of armed conflict.¹⁰⁴ Even if civilians participate in hostilities, the majority of the International Group of Experts agree that civilians retain their civilian status.¹⁰⁵ However, civilians remain subject to prosecution under the applicable domestic laws of the States capturing them.¹⁰⁶\n## A. Defining Direct Participation in Hostilities\nAs previously mentioned, civilians can be made the object of cyber-attacks if they are directly taking part in hostilities. Though civilians are protected from attack during international armed conflicts, they lose that protection if and for so long as they directly participate in hostilities.¹⁰⁷ This protection from attack and subsequent loss of protection only applies to civilians; it does not apply to members of armed forces, organized armed groups, or participants in a *levée en masse*.¹⁰⁸ Further, members of groups failing to qualify as organized armed groups would also qualify as civilians under this rule.¹⁰⁹ For example, a group would fail to be recognized as an organized armed group if they lack the required level of organization or if they fail to maintain a continuous combat function.¹¹⁰\nConducting operations in cyberspace that may rise to the level of direct participation in hostilities can be better understood by looking at the functions or tasks carried out in the cyber domain. Those involved in cyber operations seemingly fall in to three main categories according to their functions: 1) those who design or write the programs used for offense or defensive cyber operations; 2) those who install these programs on computer systems, act as service administrators, and provide technical maintenance; and 3)\n¹⁰⁴ *Id.* at Rule 25.\n¹⁰⁵ *Id.* at Rule 29.\n¹⁰⁶ *Id.* at Rule 29.\n¹⁰⁷ *Id.* at Rules 32, 35.\n¹⁰⁸ Geneva POW, *supra* note 34, art. 4; TALLINN MANUAL, *supra* note 52, at Rule 35.\n¹⁰⁹ *Id.*\n¹¹⁰ *Id.* art. 4; Melzer, *supra* note 90, at Part I.2.b.\n1030\nN.C.

Participation in hostilities can either be direct or indirect; direct participation is the engagement in specific hostile acts.¹¹⁸ The concept of hostilities is best described as the aggregate of all hostile acts carried out by all individuals, either armed forces, organized armed groups, or civilians, during an armed conflict.¹¹⁹\nThe specific acts carried out by civilians qualify as direct participation in hostilities if they meet all of the following criteria:\n¹¹¹ Cyber, supra note 57.\n¹¹² Geneva POW, supra note 34, art. 4; TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 52, at Rule 35.\n¹¹³ Melzer, supra note 90, at Part II.B.\n¹¹⁴ Id.\n¹¹⁵ Id.\n¹¹⁶ Id.\n¹¹⁷ Id. at Part VI.\n¹¹⁸ Id.\n¹¹⁹ Melzer, supra note 90, at Part VI.\n2017 THE TARGETING OF NON-STATE-AFFILIATED CIVILIANS 1031\n1) the act is likely to adversely affect the military operations or capacity of a party to an armed conflict or inflict death, injury, or destruction on persons or objects protected against direct attack, which is the threshold of harm; 2) there must be a direct causal link between the act and harm that is likely to occur from the act; and 3) the act must be specifically designed to directly cause the required threshold of harm in support of a party to the armed conflict.¹²⁰ The threshold of harm is based on likely harm and does not require the act to materialize into the expected level of harm.¹²¹ Additionally, the act does not have to be an actual attack against troops or military objects; it also includes acts of sabotage as well as disturbing deployments and communications.¹²²\nIn addition to meeting the threshold of harm, the second criterion requires there also be a direct causal link between the act and the harm. For there to be direct causation, there must be a sufficiently close causal relationship between the act and the resulting harm.¹²³ Specifically, direct causation should be brought about in one causal step.¹²⁴ Individual actions that can be viewed as merely supporting one side to an armed conflict or that only build up or maintain the capacity of a party is excluded from the concept of direct participation in hostilities.¹²⁵ For example, providing supplies for a party or financing the actions of a party to an armed conflict would bring about a result, but there is not direct causation for the potential harm. Other examples of indirect participation would be scientific research and design, recruitment and the training of personnel, and the production or transportation of weapons or equipment.¹²⁶\nThe third criterion requires there be a belligerent nexus, which is that an act must be specifically designed to directly cause the required threshold of harm in support of a party to the armed conflict.¹²⁷ Accordingly, the act must be objectively likely to inflict harm, and it must be specifically designed to do so in\n¹²⁰ *Id.* at Part V.\n¹²¹ *Id.*\n¹²² *Id.*\n¹²³ *Id.* at Part V.2.b.\n¹²⁴ *Id.* at Part V.2.f.\n¹²⁵ Melzer, *supra* note 90, at Part V.\n¹²⁶ *Id.* at Part V.2.b.\n¹²⁷ *Id.* at Part V.3.\n1032\nN.C. J. INT'L L.\n[Vol. XLII]\nsupport of a party to the armed conflict.¹²⁸ Therefore, violence that is not designed to harm a party to an armed conflict cannot amount to direct participation in hostilities.¹²⁹ This type of violence is left solely to domestic law enforcement measures and not LOAC or IHL. The belligerent nexus requirement is important, because there are many activities during armed conflict that cause a considerable level of harm but fall short of direct participation in hostilities. This is exemplified by violent crimes committed for reasons unrelated to the conflict, such as robberies or murders, as well as the theft of military equipment for private use or sale.¹³⁰ Also requiring special attention is use of individual self-defense or defense of others. If a civilian uses force to protect his property from looting, he is not doing so with a belligerent nexus.¹³¹ Instead, he is acting out of self-defense.\nUnderstanding whether hostilities by civilians during armed conflict rise to the level of direct participation is not enough. The defining moment of when the direct participation in hostilities begins and ends is also important. Preparatory measures leading up to the execution of the specific act, and the movement to and from the location of the execution, all constitute integral parts of the act.¹³² Accordingly, IHL concerns itself with more than just exactly when the act took place; it looks at the totality of the circumstances surrounding the civilian’s direct participation in hostilities.¹³³ This is a significant point, because civilians lose their protection against direct attacks for such time as they directly participate in hostilities.¹³⁴\nPreparatory measures are those that IHL would describe as military operations in preparation for an attack and which are so closely linked to the execution of the specific act that they constitute an integral part of the act.¹³⁵ Even so, there is no requirement that the preparatory measures occur immediately prior to the specific act or even in close geographic proximity to the\n128 Id.\n129 Id.\n130 Id.\n131 Melzer, supra note 90, at Part V.3.\n132 Id. at Part VI.\n133 Id.\n134 Id.\n135 Id.\n2017 THE TARGETING OF NON-STATE-AFFILIATED CIVILIANS 1033\nplace of the specific act.¹³⁶ An example in the physical domain would be a civilian who builds a bomb in his garage, which he intends to place in the road in order to blow it up and injure armed forces during an international armed conflict. In this illustration, the preparatory measures taken by the civilian bomb maker in his garage, as well as the transit to and from the place where he plants the bomb, would all be considered part of the direct participation in hostilities. Thus, the bomb maker could be targeted at any point from when he starts building the bomb in his garage until he returns home from planting it. Also included in general preparatory measures would be the transporting of personnel, gathering of intelligence, and equipping and instructing armed forces.¹³⁷ Where the execution of a hostile act does not require deployment, such as hostilities in cyberspace, the duration of the act should be limited to the immediate execution of the act.¹³⁸\n## B. Tallinn Manual View of Direct Participation in Hostilities\nThe Tallinn Manual’s International Group of Experts generally agrees with the three cumulative criteria for qualification as a direct participation in hostilities as applied to cyberspace.¹³⁹ First, there must be a threshold of harm, wherein the civilian has the intended or actual effect of negatively affecting the military operations or capabilities of a party to an armed conflict or inflicting death, physical harm, or material destruction on persons or objects protected against direct attack.¹⁴⁰ Physical damage to objects or harm to individuals is not required, so long as the cyber act negatively affects the party militarily.¹⁴¹ Second, there must be a direct causal link between the act and the harm intended.¹⁴² An example would be a civilian conducting cyber acts against an armed force in international armed conflict, wherein the civilian disrupts the command and control, even temporarily, for the armed force. Finally, there must be a belligerent nexus established by the\n¹³⁶ *Id.*\n¹³⁷ *Id.*\n¹³⁸ Melzer, *supra* note 90, at Part VI.\n¹³⁹ TALLINN MANUAL, *supra* note 52, at Rule 35, comment 4.\n¹⁴⁰ *Id.*\n¹⁴¹ *Id.*\n¹⁴² *Id.*\n1034\nN.C. J. INT'L L.\n[Vol. XLII\nact directly relating to the hostilities.¹⁴³\nIn cyberspace, direct participation in hostilities by civilians may be more difficult to delineate. Determining whether a civilian directly participated in conventional hostilities is complex by itself; making the same determination in cyber-hostilities is especially so.¹⁴⁴ Civilians conducting cyber-attacks related to an armed conflict would qualify as an act of direct participation in hostilities.¹⁴⁵ A cyber-attack is defined as a cyber operation that is reasonably expected to cause injury or death to persons or damage or destruction to objects.¹⁴⁶ Accordingly, civilians conducting cyber-attacks in this way would meet the three criteria for directly participating in hostilities. Other examples of direct participation include civilians conducting cyber operations with the intent to identify vulnerabilities in a targeted computer network or system, or civilians designing malware to take advantage of vulnerabilities in the systems of a party to an armed conflict.¹⁴⁷ Further examples in the cyber domain include civilians using cyber means to gather information on enemy operations and passing that information to the other armed force in the conflict as well as conducting distributed denial of service operations against military systems.¹⁴⁸\nOn the other hand, not all cyber operations by civilians would rise to the level of direct participation in hostilities. For example, designing malware for a specific purpose and making it available online, even if it is actually used by someone else to conduct an attack during an armed conflict, would not be considered direct participation.¹⁴⁹ What would be lacking would be the threshold of harm in the first criterion; the malware creator never had the intended or actual effect of negatively affecting military operations or capabilities. Another example would be civilians simply maintaining computer equipment generally, even if that equipment were eventually used in hostilities.¹⁵⁰ Again, what would be\n¹⁴³ *Id.*\n¹⁴⁴ Emily Crawford, *Virtual Battlegrounds: Direct Participation in Cyber Warfare*, 9 J.

Cyber operations during an armed conflict that are taken for purely criminal or private reasons would not qualify as direct participation in hostilities.¹⁵¹ As an example, a criminal using cyber means to steal funds from a party to a conflict for purely personal gain, and not to negatively affect the party, would not be directly participating in hostilities. What is difficult about this example is that the party to the armed conflict would have to determine the intent of the civilian actor, which could be disguised as purely personal and criminal when it could in fact be aimed at adversely affecting the party to the conflict. Taken a step further, if the individual stole the money from the party in order to finance particular military operations, the operation to steal the money would be considered a direct participation in hostilities.¹⁵²\nPreparatory measures in cyberspace differ from those taken in the physical domain. Because civilians can be directly targeted for the duration of time during which they are directly participating in hostilities, it is important for parties to an armed conflict to understand the timeframe of direct participation.¹⁵³ The actions taken in cyberspace immediately preceding or subsequent to a qualifying act of direct participation are included in the preparatory measures.¹⁵⁴ As an example, a civilian travelling to and from the location of the computer he uses to mount a cyber operation would be included in the preparatory measures, and the civilian could be directly targeted in transit.¹⁵⁵ The time for preparatory measures may even extend as far backward and forward in time as the causal link to the action exists.¹⁵⁶ For example, in a cyber operation this would include the time when the civilian first starts to explore the vulnerabilities of the system of a party to an armed conflict, the time the individual creates the cyber tool to exploit the vulnerabilities, the period of time the civilian attacks the system, and through to the time the individual assesses\n¹⁵¹ TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 52, at Rule 35, comment 6.\n¹⁵² Id.\n¹⁵³ Id.\n¹⁵⁴ Id. at Rule 35, comment 7.\n¹⁵⁵ Id.\n¹⁵⁶ Id.\n1036\nN.C. J. INT'L L.\n[Vol. XLII\nthe damage to the system.\nIn addition to the preparatory measures taken for a cyber operation, parties to an armed conflict must take into account the delayed effects of direct participation in hostilities by civilians. The actions taken by civilians in the cyber domain have some parallels to the physical domain, but they also vary widely. The emplacement of a logic bomb, which is designed to activate at some point in the future upon either a command or after a predetermined period of time, is an example.¹⁵⁷ The majority of the Tallinn Manual’s International Group of Experts takes the position that the time frame for which the civilian is directly participating, and can thus be targeted, is from the beginning of his involvement in mission planning until the individual terminates his active role in the operation.¹⁵⁸ It is important to point out that the end of the period of direct participation may not sync up with the point when the damage occurs.¹⁵⁹ For example, the first civilian may have created and emplaced the logic bomb, which is awaiting a command prompt to activate it. A second civilian may be the one to actually command the bomb to activate. In this example, the first civilian could have halted his period of direct participation and would no longer be directly targetable when the damage actually occurs. Thus, the key is for parties to determine when individuals are targetable based on when their participation begins and ends.¹⁶⁰\n## C. Determination of Direct Participation in Hostilities Complicated by Cyberspace-Specific Issues\nThe delayed effects of cyber operations complicate the accurate determination of precisely when a civilian is directly participating in cyber hostilities. The majority of the International Group of Experts takes the position that a civilian is directly participating in hostilities from the beginning of his involvement through the point in time where the civilian terminates an active role in the operation.¹⁶¹ The problem with this majority view is that it does not make clear to the participating civilian or to the\n¹⁵⁷ TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 52, at Rule 35, comment 8.\n¹⁵⁸ Id.\n¹⁵⁹ Id.\n¹⁶⁰ Id.\n¹⁶¹ Id. at Rule 35, comment 6.\n2017 THE TARGETING OF NON-STATE-AFFILIATED CIVILIANS 1037\nState being attacked the window of time during which the civilian may be directly and legally targeted. The civilian may terminate an active role by no longer checking the status of the ongoing cyber operation, but the State may still attribute the operation to the civilian and target him. The State may not discover the ongoing cyber operation until after the civilian has terminated an active role, but the State has no way of knowing the civilian has terminated his active role in the ongoing cyber operation.\nThe logic bomb example parallels civilian operations in the physical world. Coalition Forces fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan faced road-side improvised explosive devices (“IEDs”), which were responsible for causing death and injury to troops as well as damage to military objects. If a civilian was responsible for building, transporting, emplacing, and setting off the IED, the civilian could be targeted throughout the entire process.¹⁶² The beginning and end of the civilian’s direct participation in hostilities could be measured from the time he began sourcing parts for the bomb until the time he set off the IED and transited back from the bombsite. Similarly, the civilian responsible for the logic bomb in the aforementioned example could be targeted from the time he began creating the logic bomb until he commands the logic bomb to activate. However, technology in the cyber domain varies widely from technology in the physical domain.\nIn the cyber domain, individuals can create programs capable of running autonomously or semi-autonomously. A computer network attack (“CAN”) is defined as either a cyber, electronic, or physical attack against an information technology facility or against computer equipment.¹⁶³ Most of these CNAs are carried out by cyber operations, which use malicious code to infect enemy computers in order to exploit weaknesses in software, system configuration, or computer security practices.¹⁶⁴ Cyber operations also include the use of bots, or remotely, or semi-autonomously controlled programs infecting computers, as well as botnets, which perform espionage by transmitting data between themselves while\n¹⁶² *Id.* at Rule 35, comment 4 (providing that there is well-known, ongoing debate as to whether the assembly of an IED qualifies as direct participation in hostilities).\n¹⁶³ See generally CLAY WILSON, COMPUTER ATTACK AND CYBERTERRORISM 3-11 (2009) (providing insight on different types of attacks against computers).\n¹⁶⁴ *Id.*\n1038\nN.C. J. INT'L L.\n[Vol. XLII\nawaiting the final activation signal from the operator.¹⁶⁵ Malicious programs, such as spyware and malware, attack by disrupting normal computer functions or by opening a back door for a remote operator to take control of the computer.¹⁶⁶ Cyber operators have designed computer exploits which launch anonymously from thousands of infected computers and which produce waves of disruption to overwhelm the target of the operation.¹⁶⁷ The technology allowing autonomous and semi-autonomous operations in cyberspace makes difficult the task of determining the beginning and ending points of direct participation by civilians.¹⁶⁸\nA minority of the Tallinn Manual Group of Experts would break down the various steps in cyber operations such as the emplacement of the logic bomb and its activation as separate acts of direct participation.¹⁶⁹ Under this view, the civilian would only directly participate in hostilities in intermittent instances when he is actively engaged in hostilities.¹⁷⁰ This view provides greater protection to civilians, as they are shielded from directly being targeted except for the times when they are actively engaged in cyber operations.¹⁷¹ However, this view would make it very difficult for the parties engaged in armed conflict to accurately determine when civilians are directly participating and then target the civilians participating in hostilities at precisely those times. The Group of Experts is split regarding repeated cyber operations. One view is in line with the ICRC in that each cyber act must be treated separately in terms of direct participation analysis.¹⁷² On the other hand, another view is that it would make more operational sense if direct participation begins with the first cyber operation and continues throughout the period of intermittent activity.¹⁷³ The latter view removes the “revolving door” effect and simplifies target ability by making the intermittent activity a singular, start-to-finish cyber operation.\n165 Id.\n166 Id.\n167 Id.\n168 Id.\n169 TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 52, at Rule 35, comment 9.\n170 Id.\n171 Id. at Rule 35, comment 10.\n172 Id.\n173 Id.\n2017 THE TARGETING OF NON-STATE-AFFILIATED CIVILIANS 1039\nThe Tallinn Experts were also divided over the issue of presumption against direct participation.¹⁷⁴ Recall that the Tallinn Manual provides that in cases where there is doubt as to whether an individual is a civilian, that individual should be treated like a civilian.¹⁷⁵ The policy behind this principle is to ensure that civilians are protected to the utmost extent during armed conflicts. Some Tallinn Experts take this same line of thinking regarding civilians believed to be directly participating in hostilities.¹⁷⁶ These experts believe civilians in this predicament should be given the benefit of the doubt.¹⁷⁷\nHowever, other Tallinn Experts take the position that when there is doubt as to whether a civilian is directly participating in hostilities, the attacking state must review the relevant information available and act reasonably in the circumstances in determining whether to conduct the attack.¹⁷⁸ The policy behind this method rests in the attacking state’s ability to identify which targets are legal targets based on a reasonable review of the available information. The importance of these two views cannot be understated. Some experts side with protecting civilians to the maximum extent possible, while others favor the States’ ability to act while following LOAC principles.\nAlthough the Tallinn Manual agrees with ICRC Guidance’s requirements of a threshold of harm—a causal link between the action and the harm and a belligerent nexus—generally, the Tallinn Manual’s application of the ICRC’s guidance is a variation of the ICRC’s direct participation in hostilities legal regime involving cyber actions.¹⁷⁹ The Tallinn manual does not have a requirement for physical damage to objects, so actions that may not qualify as cyber-attacks may still satisfy the criterion for the threshold of harm if the action has negatively affected the targeted State.¹⁸⁰ Specifically, the Tallinn Manual provides that a civilian’s\n¹⁷⁴ Id. at Rule 35, comment 12.\n¹⁷⁵ TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 52, at Rule 33.\n¹⁷⁶ Id. at Rule 35, comment 12.\n¹⁷⁷ Id.\n¹⁷⁸ Id.\n¹⁷⁹ See Collin Allan, Direct Participation in Hostilities from Cyberspace, 50 VA.

J. INT'L L.\n[Vol. XLII]\naction which is carried out with only the intent of negatively affecting the adversary State’s military operations or to inflict death, physical harm, or material destruction on persons or objects is sufficient to show the threshold of harm.¹⁸¹ Furthermore, the majority of Tallinn experts agreed that interfering with an object’s functionality would rise to the level of destruction if a physical component must be replaced.¹⁸² Thus, the Tallinn view of the first-prong requirement of the threshold of harm may be seen as lowering the standard for what is required for civilians to be directly participating in hostilities.¹⁸³\nThe Tallinn Manual’s view of the second prong, which is the causal link between the act and the harm likely to result, also differs slightly from the ICRC Guidance.¹⁸⁴ In particular, the Tallinn Manual focuses on the intended harm.¹⁸⁵ By focusing on the intended harm, the Tallinn Manual may be lowering the standard of what is required for a civilian to participate in hostilities by looking at the civilian’s intent, rather than focusing on the likelihood of harm from the cyber operation. For example, a civilian may be directly targeted under the Tallinn Manual view for his role in assembling and storing the cyber equivalent of an IED because the individual intends the same harm as the person arming and detonating it.¹⁸⁶ By comparing the Tallinn Manual’s view with the ICRC Guidance, it is possible that the Tallinn Manual lowers the standards for what is required for civilians to be directly participating in cyber hostilities.¹⁸⁷ Therefore, civilians participating in hostilities through cyber means may be targetable in more situations than under the ICRC framework.¹⁸⁸\n## V.

That is, they are defined as neither members of the armed forces, which includes groups assimilated to the armed forces such as organized armed groups, nor those participating in a levée en masse.¹⁸⁹ Essentially, all others are considered civilians. Private contractors and employees of a party to an armed conflict who fit the definition of civilians are entitled to protection from being directly targeted, unless they are directly participating in hostilities.¹⁹⁰ In addition, private contractors and civilian employees are not entitled to combatant immunity, as they are not members of the armed force.¹⁹¹ The activities carried out by contractors and employees as well as their location of duty may expose them to an increased risk of death or injury even if they are not directly participating in hostilities.¹⁹²\n## A. State-Affiliated Civilians\nModern warfare is increasingly dependent upon private contractors and civilian employees to fill a variety of positions traditionally held by military personnel.¹⁹³ Generally, these private contractors and civilian employees are considered civilians under the same criteria that would apply to other civilians.¹⁹⁴ That is, they cannot be directly targeted by a party to the armed conflict unless and for so long as they directly participate in hostilities. Due to the special roles of private contractors and civilian employees and their proximity to armed forces in hostilities, parties to an armed conflict must make determinations regarding attacks with particular care and due consideration.¹⁹⁵\nThe majority of private contractors and civilian employees have been incorporated into State armed forces, but they do not\n---\n¹⁸⁹ See generally TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 52, Rule 29 (quoting the Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 Aug. 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts art. 50, § 1, June 8, 1977, 1125 U.N.T.S. 3).\n¹⁹⁰ Melzer, supra note 90.\n¹⁹¹ Id. at 38.\n¹⁹² Id. at 37.\n¹⁹³ Id.\n¹⁹⁴ Id.\n¹⁹⁵ Id.\n1042\nN.C.

For example, private contractors and civilian employees that defend the base from attack could either be directly participating in hostilities or filling a law enforcement and defense-of-others role.¹⁹⁷\nEven if they have accompanied armed forces, private contractors and civilians were never meant to (and should never be allowed to) directly participate in hostilities on behalf of a party to a conflict.¹⁹⁸ As long as they are not incorporated into armed forces, private contractors and civilian employees do not cease to be civilians, and they do not lose their civilian protection simply because they accompany armed forces.¹⁹⁹ Moreover, they do not lose their civilian protection just because they assume functions other than conducting hostilities, which traditionally would have been performed by members of armed forces.²⁰⁰ Contractors and civilian employees who directly participate in hostilities without the express authorization of the party to the armed conflict remain civilians, but they lose their protection from being directly targeted.²⁰¹ Contractors and employees can lose their civilian status if they have been incorporated into the armed forces of a party to a conflict.²⁰² If this happens, the contractors and employees would become members of an organized armed force under the command responsible for the party to the conflict and would no longer qualify as civilians.²⁰³\n---\n¹⁹⁶ See Melzer, *supra* note 90, at 37 (explaining the basic notion of direct participation in hostilities).\n¹⁹⁷ See *id.* at 44 (illustrating that “[t]he notion of direct participation in hostilities does not refer to a person’s status, function, or affiliation, but to his or her engagement in specific hostile acts”).\n¹⁹⁸ *Id.* at 38.\n¹⁹⁹ *Id.*\n²⁰⁰ *Id.*\n²⁰¹ *Id.*\n²⁰² See Melzer, *supra* note 90, at 39 (explaining that “[a]s long as they are not incorporated into the armed forces, private contractors and civilian employees do not cease to be civilians simply because they accompany the armed forces and or assume functions other than the conduct of hostilities that would traditionally have been performed by military personnel”).\n²⁰³ *Id.*\n2017 THE TARGETING OF NON-STATE-AFFILIATED CIVILIANS 1043\nThe Tallinn Manual’s international group of experts concurs that individual contractors and civilians may only be directly targeted based on their direct participation in hostilities during an armed conflict.²⁰⁴ However, there are issues that arise in cyberspace regarding the use of contractors and civilians to perform specific military operations. Unlike traditional warfare, where almost all military operations were carried out by troops and equipment, modern warfare introduces the use of cyber capabilities which conduct a portion of the military operations. An example is the hiring of a private company by a party to an armed conflict that is later contracted to perform specific military operations.²⁰⁵ Based on the military operations, the company would qualify as an organized armed group belonging to the party to the conflict.²⁰⁶ Therefore, the civilians employed as private contractors would be considered belonging to the organized armed group. However, even if the civilians were not to be considered as belonging to the organized armed group, they would still only be directly targetable when and if they are directly participating in hostilities.²⁰⁷\nCivilian government employees are also employed in positions requiring them to conduct cyber operations during an armed conflict, such as positions within an intelligence agency.²⁰⁸ If the group of civilians conducting cyber operations qualifies as an organized armed group, the civilian members are subject to attack regardless of direct participation in hostilities.²⁰⁹ Otherwise, the civilian employees are only directly targetable when they are directly participating in hostilities. As a result, the historic view of citizens carrying out actions typically performed by members of armed forces may be problematic when analyzing the cyber domain construct. The traditional view of warfare holds that private contractors and civilian employees operating in an organized armed group, affiliated with armed forces in an armed conflict, would not be entitled to combatant status.²¹⁰\n204 TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 52, at Rule 34, comment 7.\n205 Id.\n206 Id.\n207 Id.\n208 Id. at Rule 34, comment 8.\n209 Id. at Rule 34, comment 7.\n210 See Sean Watts, Notion of Combatancy in Cyber Warfare, FOURTH INT’L. CONF.\n1044\nN.C. J. INT'L L.\n[Vol. XLII]\nFurthermore, a party to the armed conflict employing civilians to perform intelligence functions, attack execution, or other CNA operations would violate the law of war.²¹¹ The reasoning behind this view is that only members of armed forces or assimilated organizations are granted combatant status because they meet the following conditions: (i) they are commanded by a person responsible for his subordinates; (ii) they have a fixed distinctive emblem recognizable at distance; (iii) they carry arms openly; and (iv) they conduct their operation in accordance with the laws and customs of war.²¹² Accordingly, under the traditional view, parties to an armed conflict should employ members of the armed force to carry out CNA functions, and if they desire contractors or civilian employees to fill these roles, then the parties should incorporate them into the regular armed forces.²¹³\nDue to the vastly different landscape and operations carried out in cyberspace as opposed to the physical domain, a suggested course of action would be to rely less on the aforementioned four conditions and instead look to state affiliation.²¹⁴ The four criteria from the 1874 Brussels Declaration apply perfectly to traditional warfare, but operations in cyberspace are conducted without the need of having a fixed recognizable emblem or of carrying arms openly. By requiring state affiliation for civilian employees, it preserves concern for the principle of distinction in CNA from the Brussels criteria.²¹⁵ States employing civilians to conduct cyber operations are less likely to be doing so to prevent the enemy from attacking the civilians.²¹⁶ Instead, States are likely taking advantage of the economic, training, and recruiting advantages that develop as a result of not being limited to armed forces filling these behind-the-lines roles.²¹⁷ The fact that cyber operations take\nON CYBER CONFLICT, 235, 242 (2012), https://ccdcoe.org/cycon/2012/proceedings/d2r1s10_watts.pdf [https://perma.cc/X6F2-TTRP] [hereinafter Notion of Combatancy].\n²¹¹ Id.\n²¹² See id. at 245 (citing the Project of an International Declaration Concerning the Laws and Customs of War, Aug. 27, 1874, 4 Martens Nouveau Recueil (ser. 2) 219 (“1874 Brussels Declaration”)).\n²¹³ Id.\n²¹⁴ Id.\n²¹⁵ Id.\n²¹⁶ See Notion of Combatancy, supra note 210, at 246.\n²¹⁷ Id.\n2017 THE TARGETING OF NON-STATE-AFFILIATED CIVILIANS 1045\nplace far from the battlefield also bolsters the position of state affiliation, because there is no concern that the enemy will be confused regarding distinction in targeting.²¹⁸\nUnder the state affiliation view of civilians taking part in cyber operations, discipline in warfare will continue to be preserved as it is under the four Brussels criteria.²¹⁹ Currently, civilians directly participating in hostilities are not subject to the internal military disciplinary system.²²⁰ However, the well-developed legal regimes that prosecute and punish war crimes operate in a manner to vindicate concerns for discipline and humanity.²²¹ In addition to international enforcement bodies, domestic criminal codes now serve as mechanisms where civilians are equally susceptible to prosecution for any war crimes they have committed.²²² Under the state-affiliation view, States will be able to employ civilians to conduct cyber operations while enabling combatant status. States will also be able to maintain the critically important notions of distinction and discipline as provided under the four Brussels criteria.²²³\nStates employing private contractors and civilian employees do so because of the different landscape and types of operations carried out in cyberspace. As they are written and observed, current LOAC principles, ICRC guidance, and the Tallinn Manual hold that civilians operating in cyberspace in a way that directly participates in hostilities are subject to directly being targeted but are not given combatant immunity. The view of letting state-affiliation drive combatant status determinations for cyberspace operations provides civilians with combatant status, or a version of it, while parties to an armed conflict can still conduct warfare and be no worse off. Currently, parties to an armed conflict operating in cyberspace are left with the difficult task of making determinations regarding direct participation in hostilities by civilians operating anonymously. The state-affiliation view would, at the least, put civilians on notice of what their consequences of participation entail, as well as protect them by\n218 Id.\n219 Id. at 247.\n220 Id.\n221 Id. at 248.\n222 See Notion of Combatancy, supra note 210, at 248.\n223 Id.\n1046\nN.C.

When viewed as either contractors, who are working on behalf of a State engaged in an international armed conflict, or hacktivists, who operate outside of the control of the State but engage in cyber operations in favor of the State, the statuses of each may be seen as divergent.²²⁴ While neither of the two would qualify for combatant immunity, based on the four requirements provided by the Third Geneva Convention,²²⁵ contractors would have the best shot at being entitled prisoner-of-war (“POW”) status.²²⁶ Due to the nature of their service, contractors accompanying an armed force likely carry identification cards associating them with the armed force.²²⁷ Accordingly, contractors would not be given combatant status, but they would be more likely than hacktivists to be given POW status.²²⁸\nCivilians accompanying armed forces are afforded some protection, but that protection comes with the inherent danger of accompanying armed forces. State-affiliated civilians qualifying for the narrow category of “civilians accompanying the armed forces” could be eligible for POW status while at the same time also be legitimate military targets for the enemy State.²²⁹ These civilians would likely be performing duties in the functional category of operating and maintaining the cyber operations systems.²³⁰ The civilians filling this state-affiliated role would\n²²⁴ See Logan Liles, *The Civilian Cyber Battlefield: Non-State Cyber Operators’ Status Under the Law of Armed Conflict*, 39 N.C.

The majority of the participation by a state-affiliated civilian cyber scientist would be viewed as indirect participation.²³² However, there are possible situations where a civilian’s particular expertise could have an exceptional and potentially decisive value for the outcome of an armed conflict.²³³ An example would be a computer programmer who researches and writes attack programs, one of which is used to incapacitate the enemy’s network controlling the launch of weapons systems.²³⁴ In this example, the civilian scientist could be responsible for the turning point in the conflict, thus shifting his participation from indirect to direct.²³⁵ The importance of this example is that the State hosting the state-affiliated civilian and the civilian need to understand the possible implications of having the scientist participate, directly or indirectly, in hostilities. Further, the enemy State is going to have to make a call as to whether it can directly target the civilian scientist or attack the military target and consider the scientist collateral damage.\n## B. Non-State-Affiliated Civilians\nNon-state-affiliated civilians, also known as patriotic hackers or hacktivists, are the civilians directly participating in hostilities armed forces’ (presumably those who operate and maintain those systems)—even if they do not actually press the button that launches a cyberattack—are both eligible for prisoner-of-war status and also legitimate military targets for the enemy”).\n²³¹ *Id.*\n²³² *See id.* at 291–92 (stating that “there is a high probability that many, if not most, of the personnel substantively involved in cyber operations may actually be civilians”).\n²³³ *See id.* at 292 (discussing that “[c]omputer technicians, technical maintenance personnel and others who perform similar tasks . . . could thus qualify for inclusion in the limited category of ‘persons who accompany the armed forces without actually being members thereof’”).\n²³⁴ *See id.* at 291 (distinguishing computer programmers who research and write attack programs from operators who execute cyber attacks).\n²³⁵ Turns, *supra* note 62, at 291.\n1048\nN.C. J. INT'L L.\n[Vol. XLII]\non their own volition, so they will likely receive no protection under LOAC. These hackers carry out cyber operations against perceived enemy computer systems, without the control or oversight from their government but seek common political ends.²³⁶ Hacktivists would seem to receive no protection due to their direct participation in hostilities; however, hacktivists could arguably be considered participants in a *levée en masse* if they took up arms spontaneously upon the enemy approaching, lack organization, and carried arms openly.²³⁷ If so, hacktivists would be entitled to POW status, but they could be directly targeted while directly participating in hostilities.²³⁸ The LOAC principles have not been updated for cyber operations, so it is difficult to play out exactly how non-state-affiliated civilians are to be treated during international armed conflicts. Ideally, IHL would be universally understood by states engaged in armed conflict and the non-state-affiliated civilians who choose to directly participate in cyber hostilities would be on notice as to how their actions will be measured.\nAlso, made difficult by the landscape and types of operations carried out in cyberspace is the direct targeting of those individuals directly participating. Aside from anonymity being a difficult hurdle in cyberspace, the determination as to whether a physical attack is justified in response to a cyber action is still theoretical. Furthermore, neither treaties nor customary international law have established the illegality of espionage, either in the physical world or in cyberspace. Thus, civilians conducting CNAs on behalf of a State which is party to an armed conflict may not be directly participating in hostilities. Further, customary international law has not recognized data manipulation and deletions as rising to the level of hostilities, so civilians conducting these types of CNAs would not be directly participating in hostilities.\n## VI. Suggested Treatment For Non-State-Affiliated Civilians\n²³⁶ *Id.* at 293.\n²³⁷ *See id.* (explaining that hacktivists could arguably be assimilated to the rarely used category of *levée en masse*, in which case they would be entitled to POW status if captured, and could also be subject to attack while acting as such a body; [i]n order to meet the legal conditions of a *levée en masse* they would have to “take up arms” spontaneously “on the approach of the enemy”).\n²³⁸ *See id.* (explaining the difficulty of applying the criteria necessary to meet the legal conditions of a *levée en masse* in a cyber-conflict).\n2017 THE TARGETING OF NON-STATE-AFFILIATED CIVILIANS 1049\n# Directly Participating In Cyber Hostilities\nThe principles of LOAC, as they currently exist, govern actions taken in cyberspace as if they occur in the more traditional, physical domain. A major concern with this LOAC application is the effect it has on civilians. As the law of war has evolved, the protection of civilians has been one of the key tenets from the outset. The Fourth Geneva Convention sought to protect civilian persons taking no part in hostilities as well as the wounded and sick.²³⁹ The Convention also prohibited an occupying power from destroying real and personal property belonging to civilians.²⁴⁰ The Additional Protocol I of the Geneva Convention calls for the protection of civilians from unnecessary injury or death and obliges combatants to distinguish themselves from the civilian population while engaged in an attack.²⁴¹ The civilian population is specifically protected under Part IV, which demands the parties to at all times distinguish between civilian population and combatants as well as between civilian objects and military objectives.²⁴² Further, Protocol I prohibits parties from making the civilian population the object of an attack, which also prohibits acts or threats having the intent to terrorize the civilian population.²⁴³\nThe protections provided by LOAC are two-fold. On one hand, they are meant to inform parties to an armed conflict regarding how to conduct themselves while at war. On the other hand, LOAC provides notice to civilians affected by armed conflict as to the treatment they can expect from the parties to the conflict. The relative nuance of cyberspace operations, as compared to traditional warfare, makes difficult the determination of direct participation in hostilities by citizens. If LOAC principles are incapable of adequately putting parties to armed conflict and citizens on notice, it should be amended for this purpose.\n²³⁹ Geneva Convention, supra note 2, art. 15.\n²⁴⁰ Id.\n²⁴¹ Id. art. 44.\n²⁴² Protocol I, supra note 1, art. 48.\n²⁴³ Id. art. 51.\n1050\nN.C. J. INT'L L.\n[Vol. XLII\n## A. Temporal Considerations in the Cyber Domain\nDirect participation in hostilities by civilians operating in the cyber domain is vastly different than participation in the physical domain due to temporal considerations. Actions taken in cyberspace are not easily detected as they are happening, and they are often created for use in the future. For example, computer network attacks involve the use of malicious code to either infect an enemy’s computer system or to exploit weaknesses in the software, system configuration, or security practices.²⁴⁴ Additionally, bots and even botnets are remotely-controlled or semi-autonomous computer programs that infect computers and systems to transmit data obtained by the system or instruct the system to operate a certain way.²⁴⁵ Hackers have even designed ways to exploit computers and systems in a way to launch programs anonymously and autonomously from thousands of infected computers.²⁴⁶ Accordingly, cyber operations differ greatly from physical operations due to the timing of how the operations are carried out. Cyber operations can be set to take place at a certain time in the future or after a certain event has occurred.\nThe ICRC Guidance and the Tallinn Manual both touch on these temporal considerations. The ICRC provides that preparatory acts can be treated as separate acts and distinguished from the act that is the object of the direct participation in hostilities.²⁴⁷ Therefore, a civilian participating in hostilities may\n²⁴⁴ See WILSON, supra note 163, at 39 (explaining the characteristics of malicious code).\n²⁴⁵ Id. at 38 (explaining that “[a]utomated programs, or ‘bots’ . . . are increasingly autonomous, rapid, and difficult to detect . . . [and] can be remotely controlled by commands sent through the Internet and can be activated to operate in a coordinated manner on thousands of computers in different locations around the world”); see id. at 41 (explaining that “[s]ome compromised computers become part of an automatic ‘bot network,’ quietly performing espionage by transmitting data or intermediate preparatory instructions back and forth between compromised computers while awaiting a special final activation signal originating from the attacker”).\n²⁴⁶ See id. at 43 (explaining that “hackers have also designed recent computer exploits that launch anonymously from thousands of infected computers to produce waves of disruption that can quickly overwhelm a targeted organization, or multiple organizations such as a list of banking institutions”).\n²⁴⁷ See Melzer, supra note 90, at 68 (stating that “[w]here the execution of a hostile act does not require geographic displacement, as may be the case with computer network attacks or remote-controlled weapons systems, the duration of direct participation in\n2017 THE TARGETING OF NON-STATE-AFFILIATED CIVILIANS 1051\nconduct a series of acts, each directly participating in hostilities, over a period of time that lead up to the object of the direct participation. The Tallinn Manual provides that the scope of direct participation includes the actions immediately preceding and those subsequent to the qualifying act of direct participation in hostilities.²⁴⁸ The majority of the Tallinn Experts agree that a civilian is directly targetable only for the duration of the direct participation in hostilities, regardless of when the actual effects are realized.²⁴⁹ Yet, some of the experts take the position that the time period during which a civilian can be directly targeted extends for as long as there is a causal link to the intended harm.²⁵⁰ That is, a civilian is targetable as far upstream and as far downstream as that civilian’s causal link exists between the action taken and the intended harm.²⁵¹ As an example, a civilian may be targeted as early as when he begins a cyber operation by probing the enemy’s system and carry through to when he conducts the cyber operation against the system.²⁵² The civilian may even be targeted after the cyber operation, when he is conducting a damage assessment and determining whether to conduct another operation against the system.²⁵³\nThese temporal considerations are worth exploring because they mostly exist only in the cyber context. Accordingly, there may be a disconnect between how States view cyber operations versus operations in the physical world due to the way LOAC principles were developed for the physical world. Though it is possible to parallel these temporal considerations by discussing IEDs emplaced for the destruction of the enemy State’s equipment and the injury of its people, there is not a precise match. While IEDs can be emplaced with the intent of them going off in the future upon being activated, IEDs with this setup cannot be controlled and changed like their logic bomb counterpart in the cyber world. Applying LOAC principles to an IED would yield\n²⁴⁸ TALLINN MANUAL, *supra* note 52, at Rule 35, comment 7.\n²⁴⁹ *Id.* at Rule 35, comment 8.\n²⁵⁰ *Id.* at Rule 35, comment 7.\n²⁵¹ *Id.*\n²⁵² *Id.*\n²⁵³ *Id.*\n1052\nN.C. J. INT'L L.\n[Vol. XLII\nthe bomb maker likely being targetable while building the bomb, based on his intent, and the civilian emplacing the IED being targetable while emplacing the IED. It would not be as clean cut in the cyber world based on the ability of the logic bomb builder and the one who activates it to carry out the entire operation in complete anonymity as well as being able to control the logic bomb once it is emplaced.\nFor the sake of clarifying the discussion below, the civilians being discussed are non-state-affiliated civilians. State-affiliated civilians are those who operate as either private contractors on behalf of the State or as civilian employees, who are employed by the State. These civilians are better aware of their exposure to direct attack based on the nature of their service, which could include operational as well as geographic proximity to armed forces. Thus, the State and the state-affiliated civilians are on notice as to whether and for how long the civilians may be directly targeted by the opposing state during an armed conflict.\nAdditional Protocol I provides that civilians and civilian populations enjoy general protection against dangers arising from military operations.²⁵⁴ However, civilians forfeit this protection if and for so long as they directly participate in hostilities.²⁵⁵ Direct participation by civilians in cyberspace is not always clear. The International Group of Experts was split regarding repeated cyber operations by civilians that qualified as direct participation in hostilities.²⁵⁶ Some of the experts side with ICRC guidance, which provides that each act must be treated separately as separate acts of direct participation.²⁵⁷ Other experts conclude separate direct participation analysis made little operational sense and believe it would create a “revolving door” effect regarding targetability.²⁵⁸ This group of experts believes direct participation by the civilian begins with the first cyber operation he participates in and continues throughout the period of intermittent activity.²⁵⁹ This incongruent application of existing LOAC principles on cyberspace operations demonstrates the potential for civilians and\n²⁵⁴ Protocol I, supra note 1, art. 51.\n²⁵⁵ Id.\n²⁵⁶ TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 52, Rule 35, comment 7.\n²⁵⁷ Id.\n²⁵⁸ Id.\n²⁵⁹ Id.\n2017 THE TARGETING OF NON-STATE-AFFILIATED CIVILIANS 1053\nparties to an armed conflict to misapply or misinterpret LOAC principles.\nWhat if a non-state-affiliated civilian were to create an autonomous logic bomb and release it with the intent to infiltrate and attack the computer network of the defense ministry of a State which is party to an ongoing armed conflict? At what point could the civilian be targeted by the State? If the State discovers the logic bomb months after it was released by the civilian, and assuming the State can attribute it to the civilian, can the State target the civilian then? Under ICRC guidance, the civilian could be directly targeted for each act of direct participation in hostilities.²⁶⁰ Accordingly, the civilian could be directly attacked when producing the logic bomb with the intent to launch a CNA against the State, if done so in support of another party to the conflict, and when the civilian actually launches the logic bomb.²⁶¹ However, ICRC guidance would not likely support a direct attack against the civilian if discovered months after it was launched. Under the Tallinn Manual’s viewpoint, the civilian may be directly targeted.²⁶²\nAs discussed above, it may be unclear to civilians directly participating in hostilities in the cyber domain as to how their actions could be interpreted by parties to an armed conflict. Aside from civilians conducting intermittent direct participation in hostilities in cyberspace, civilians may also be unclear as to their exposure for direct targeting due to the uncertain application of LOAC principles to the cyber domain. Specifically, civilians launching autonomous or semi-autonomous programs to attack computer networks may directly participate in hostilities by building the code and program for the specific purpose as well as directly participate by launching the CNA.²⁶³ However, these civilians may at some point decide they no longer wish to pursue the action against a party to an armed conflict.\n²⁶⁰ JEAN-MARIE HENCKAERTS &amp; LOUISE DOSWALD-BECK, CUSTOMARY INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW VOL. 1: RULES 1, 21 (2005).\n²⁶¹ Id.\n²⁶² Id. at 23.\n²⁶³ Turns, supra note 62, at 281.\n1054\nN.C. J. INT'L L.\n[Vol. XLII\n## B. Change of Heart for Civilians Directly Participating in Cyber Hostilities\nHow might a civilian make clear to a State embroiled in an armed conflict that the civilian who conducted a cyber operation against the State no longer wishes to directly participate in cyber hostilities? In the physical domain, the civilian would simply stop shooting at the party, collecting arms to use against the party, building bombs to emplace in roadways, or collecting money to finance attacks against the party to the conflict.²⁶⁴ An example which could parallel the cyber domain would be a civilian bomb maker who makes a bomb and emplaces that bomb in a road in an effort to target a party to an armed conflict. However, the bomb maker could make clear his intentions to no longer directly participate by putting up a sign warning of the bomb, digging up the bomb, or telling the party the location of the bomb. In cyberspace, a civilian who creates the malicious code for the CNA and launches it may not be able to recall the code or stop the cyber operation once it has begun.²⁶⁵ Once the malicious code is discovered, the targeted State may attack the civilian because it is impossible to precisely determine if the civilian has stopped directly participating in cyber hostilities. The State could argue the civilian is still monitoring and directing the logic bomb or malicious code.\nThe advanced technology which enables civilians to directly participate in hostilities could make it difficult for both the civilian and the party to the armed conflict to know when the civilian is no longer directly participating.²⁶⁶ The civilian who produces the malicious code for a CNA concludes his direct participation when he stops working on or even finishes the code. Would the civilian who launches the malicious code for a CNA conclude his direct participation when the code is launched? What if the malicious code were autonomous or semi-autonomous, and it would continue to operate without the aid from the civilian? This would seem to be a magic bullet fired in the physical world. In the physical domain, the bullet would lose speed and fall to the earth. However, malicious code launched in the cyber domain may\n²⁶⁴ *Id.*\n²⁶⁵ *Id.*\n²⁶⁶ *Id.*\n2017 THE TARGETING OF NON-STATE-AFFILIATED CIVILIANS 1055\ncontinue until it is discovered and counter by the attacked party or until it reaches its termination stage, if it has one. May the civilian launching this code be directly targeted until the malicious code ceases to operate as part of the CNA?\nCurrent interpretations by the ICRC and the International Group of Experts contributing to the Tallinn Manual apply IHL to the cyber domain and determine that the civilian launching the CNA code can only be targeted so long as he is directly participating in hostilities, which is when he is actively engaged.²⁶⁷ The ICRC and the Group of Experts are unwilling to extend the window of targetability to include ongoing hostilities set in motion by the individual unleashing the malicious code aimed at conducting a CNA.²⁶⁸ As previously stated in the magic bullet analogy, there is nothing to stop the CNA code except for the initiator, unless the attacked State becomes aware of the CNA and takes steps to defend against it. Accordingly, should not the attacked State be able to target the civilian initiator after he has set in motion the CNA? If the State is able to stretch the targetability window to legally target the initiating civilian so long as the CNA is underway, can the civilian limit his exposure in any way?\nA solution might be found in the American Law Institute’s Model Penal Code (“MPC”). The MPC defines criminal conspiracy as a person conspiring with another person or group of persons to commit a crime if the individual, with the purpose of promoting or facilitating the crime: 1) agrees with the other person or group that one or more of them will engage in conduct constituting a crime; or 2) agrees to aid the other person or group in planning or committing the crime.²⁶⁹ However, the actor may, after having conspired to commit a crime, use as an affirmative defense the fact that the actor thwarted the success of the conspiracy after having manifested a complete and voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.²⁷⁰ By renouncing his support for the crime and thwarting the success of the conspiracy, the actor is able to undo the effort he put into conspiring to commit the crime.\n²⁶⁷ Eva Knopova, *New IHL Framework for Cyber Warfare: Master’s Thesis*, CHARLES UNIV. PRAGUE DEP’T INT’L L. 47 (2016).\n²⁶⁸ Id.\n²⁶⁹ American Law Institute, *MODEL PENAL CODE § 5.03* (Tent. Draft No. 4, 1955).\n²⁷⁰ Id.\n1056\nN.C. J. INT'L L.\n[Vol. XLII]\nAs applied to the above issue regarding civilians directly participating in cyber hostilities, a civilian putting into place malicious code capable of autonomously conducting a CNA may be able to be certain he cannot be directly targeted by the party to an armed conflict by renouncing his support for the cyber hostilities and working to thwart further cyber hostilities by the code.²⁷¹ By attempting to prevent future direct targeting, the civilian may inadvertently leave himself exposed to attack by making his actions and identity known to the party. However, a party to an armed conflict abiding by LOAC would not be able to target a civilian who is no longer participating in hostilities.²⁷² Further, the civilian may take similar actions to renounce his participation and thwart further action by the code in an anonymous way.\nBy adopting this view, States who are a party to an armed conflict have better ground rules as to how to legally target non-state-affiliated civilians who are participating in cyber hostilities in a way that may not be covered by current IHL.²⁷³ Additionally, under this view, civilians will have a better understanding of how their actions, carried out as cyber operations, will be treated by States who are a party to an armed conflict. This view provides States and civilians with notice of how actions by civilians will be treated in cyberspace. Further, this view provides civilians who have participated in cyber hostilities, and who may be determined to be still participating based on the autonomous CNA code the individual initiated, an opportunity to remove themselves from hostilities. By taking steps discussed in the MPC to remove oneself from a conspiracy, the initiating individual can undo the bonds currently opening himself up to being targeted by a party to the conflict.²⁷⁴\nBy coming forward, renouncing his support for the ongoing cyber hostilities, and attempting to thwart the object of the cyber\n²⁷¹ HENCKAERTS &amp; DOSWALD-BECK, supra note 260, at 19–20.\n²⁷² See generally INT’L &amp; OPERATIONAL L.

The civilian directly taking part in cyber hostilities, favoring a party to an armed conflict by conducting cyber operations against an opponent party, also exposes himself to domestic criminal law pertaining to the cyber operations. By coming forward, the civilian may be opening himself up to prosecution under domestic criminal law in an effort to prevent being directly targeted by the State against whom the civilian directly participated in hostilities.²⁷⁶ This may create a disincentive for civilians to expose themselves as ongoing direct participants in cyber hostilities, but the damage is already done.\nThe only question that remains is attribution. Can the attacked State determine who the civilian is for either direct targeting purposes or domestic criminal prosecution? If the civilian believes so, the civilian could limit his exposure to being directly attacked as well as request leniency from the domestic criminal prosecution for his cooperation.²⁷⁷ The alternative is for the civilian to figure out a way to completely remove every trace of his participation in an ongoing cyber operation, thereby ensuring the attacked State does not discover the cyber operation, attribute it to the civilian, and directly attack him.²⁷⁸\nWithout this possible outlet, civilians who have had a change of heart and no longer wish to participate in cyber hostilities may be targeted in the future for previous participation in cyber hostilities, of which they no longer wish to be a part. Though not a perfect method for keeping civilians safe from being directly targeted, this method provides notice to the attacking State of the civilian’s previous acts, which are the acts the civilian no longer wishes to be held accountable for in the realm of armed conflict. The civilian’s renouncing of previous participation in hostilities will not absolve him of domestic law implications, but it will ensure he is not targeted in the future.²⁷⁹\n275 Turns, supra note 62, at 281.\n276 Id.\n277 Melzer, supra note 90, at 83.\n278 Id.\n279 Id.\n1058\nN.C. J. INT'L L.\n[Vol. XLII]\n# VII. Conclusion\nCivilians directly participate in hostilities for numerous reasons. State-affiliated civilians might engage in direct participation as part of their job; non-state-affiliated civilians might directly participate out of a sense of patriotism, helping the underdog, or feeling like part of the fight. Cyberspace creates an environment unlike any other ever seen before, so civilians and States who are a party to an armed conflict struggle to understand how LOAC principles apply to their conduct. A misunderstanding by a civilian could lead to a prolonged period of being directly targeted by a party to a conflict; a misunderstanding by that party could lead to allegations of war crimes. All sides to a conflict, to include civilians, would benefit from consensus in the application of LOAC to the cyber domain.\nA consensus in the application of LOAC principles in the cyber domain could lead to stronger footing for States and citizens as the cyberspace domain becomes a larger battleground. Cyberspace issues such as anonymity, attribution, temporal considerations, and equal application of force between the physical and cyber domains all highlight the need to better define LOAC applications to the cyber domain.²⁸⁰ Specifically, civilians should be able to renounce their direct participation in cyber hostilities, and they should no longer face direct targeting by a party to a conflict for cyber operations taken previously. The Tallinn Manual spells out that civilians may be directly targeted so long as their causal link to the action exists.²⁸¹ States subscribing to this view may link civilians to cyber operations carried out previously, even after civilians have walked away and no longer desire to directly participate.\nThe ability to target civilians for previous acts of cyber hostilities when States believe a causal link still exists may lead to an expanded window of time during which a civilian may be targeted. Thus, States who are party to a conflict should be able to know with certainty that the civilian they intend to target is a lawful target, due to the civilian’s ongoing intent to directly participate in hostilities. The renunciation clause found in the Model Penal Code could be the solution to ending\n²⁸⁰ Turns, supra note 62, at 281.\n²⁸¹ Id.\n2017 THE TARGETING OF NON-STATE-AFFILIATED CIVILIANS 1059\nmisunderstandings by civilians and parties to a conflict regarding direct participation and targeting.²⁸²\nUnder this view, civilians have a way to guarantee they will no longer be directly targeted for past cyber operations amounting to direct participation in hostilities when the State may not know the civilian’s participation has concluded. In addition, this view provides an out for States directly targeting civilians for directly participating in cyber hostilities against the State because the civilian has the opportunity and incentive to come clean if the civilian no longer wishes to directly participate. By coming forward, civilians may open themselves up to domestic prosecution, but they guarantee they will not be directly targeted by a State.\nA final point is examined by asking: should civilians have to go to such lengths to ensure they will not be directly targeted by a State for previous instances of direct participation in hostilities? Further, should LOAC require citizens to take active steps to put States on notice as to the citizens’ activities to prevent being illegally targeted after the direct participation in hostilities has concluded? An argument can be made that this policy would be requiring too much of civilians, and it exposes civilians to a lose-lose scenario.\nOn the one hand, civilians want to ensure the temporal anomalies in the cyber domain do not mislead States into falsely believing civilians are continuing to directly participate in hostilities after participation has ended. On the other, civilians want to protect against domestic prosecution and initiating an investigation into their activities. Though a possible solution to the issue of civilians being overly or illegally targeted could be found in the Model Penal Code, international law may not be willing to support the process or potential side effects to civilians providing notice to States that the civilians have withdrawn from the direct participation in hostilities.\n282 Id.\n^{}[]"

Civilians, like any other group, are not prohibited from directly participating in hostilities, but they lose their protection from being directly targeted for such time as they chose to do so.¹ This protection for civilians is easier understood as it is applied to the physical domain, for which it was created. The cyber domain is vastly different. Accordingly, civilians and States who are party to international armed conflicts are left to apply their own understanding of how LOAC principles should be applied to the cyber domain.\nThe difference of interpretation by civilians and parties to armed conflict could leave civilians overly exposed to direct attack and parties accountable for war crimes. This is especially true for non-state-affiliated civilians conducting cyber hostilities against a State that is party to an armed conflict. The differentiation between state-affiliated and non-state-affiliated civilians matters, because state-affiliated civilians should understand they may be injured or killed based on their work alongside and their proximity to armed forces. Thus, they are likely on notice that they may be directly targeted if directly participating in hostilities as well as considered collateral damage during a legal attack by an enemy State. In addition, civilians may open themselves up to an extended period of time during which they may be directly targeted based on the type of cyber operation they conduct.\nVarying views support the notion that civilians intermittently participating directly in hostilities may be targeted throughout a linked-together period of participation. Further, if a civilian were to launch against a State a cyber operation that activates at a set point in the future or after a forecasted event, the State could possibly treat the civilian as directly participating in hostilities long after the civilian actually initiated and participated in the cyber operation. This delayed direct targeting of the civilian can happen either because the State is unaware of exactly when the cyber operation was launched against it or because it interprets its ¹ Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts, June 8, 1977, 110 Stat. 2104, 1125 U.N.T.S. 51 [hereinafter Protocol I].\n\nresponse as warranted under LOAC.\nAlong with opening themselves up to being directly targeted, civilians participating in cyber hostilities may also face domestic criminal law exposure for their cyber hostilities. States that are party to an armed conflict could seek to lawfully target the civilian rather than await a domestic law prosecution. A possible solution to civilians being overly exposed to direct attack for their decision to directly participate in cyber hostilities could come from the Model Penal Code’s view of renouncing one’s role and thwarting the overall success of the act. Under this theory, a civilian could make the enemy State aware of the civilian’s plot to conduct an ongoing cyber operation against the State in an effort to absolve the civilian of being targeted in the future. However, these civilians may still face domestic criminal law repercussions for doing so.\n## II. The Treatment of Civilians in Traditional Warfare Whether it is their own loss of life or injury, the loss or injury of a relative, or the collateral damage of their property, civilians always suffer during war. Accordingly, major nation states have been working together for over a century to address the way traditional wars are fought, and they have sought to add a sense of humanity and require discrimination in targeting. In 1949, major nation states acceded to the Fourth Geneva Convention, which was called “The Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War” and sought to protect noncombatants.² Prior to the Geneva Conventions, civilians were left to the mercy of the combatants and their beliefs as to sparing civilians.³ The Geneva Conventions codified what had been inching closer to customary law for decades.⁴ The movement in this direction can be seen by the Lieber Code, which sought to regulate war; and later the Declaration of St. Petersburg in 1868, which prohibited the use of specific weapons for humanitarian reasons.⁵ The ² Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, Aug. 12, 1949, 110 Stat. 2104, 75 U.N.T.S. 287 [hereinafter Geneva Convention].\n³ See ANICÉE VAN ENGELAND, CIVILIAN OR COMBATANT?: A CHALLENGE FOR THE 21ST CENTURY ix-xix (2011).\n⁴ Id.\n⁵ Id. at 13–14.\n\n[Vol. XLII] international agreement formed at the 1874 Brussels Convention discussed laws and customs of war and provided that combatant forces are not granted unlimited power as to how to injure the enemy.⁶ This provision was later codified in the Hague Regulations of 1907, as was the general understanding of the need for discrimination between civilians and combatants.⁷ Additionally, the Hague Peace Conferences of 1899 and 1907 became the first internationally codified documents providing that civilians should not suffer from the effects of hostilities.⁸ ## A. Geneva Convention and the Additional Protocol The Fourth Geneva Convention, which occurred in 1949, specifically sought to protect civilians during times of war.⁹ Under the Fourth Geneva Convention, persons taking no active part in the hostilities are to be treated humanely and without regard to their faith, sex, race, or religion.¹⁰ In addition, parties to the conflict are to establish neutral zones in regions of combat to shelter wounded and sick combatants and civilians taking no part in hostilities from the effects of war.¹¹ The wounded and the sick are specifically protected and should be provided particular care and respect.¹² In addition to the Fourth Geneva Convention, the Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (“Additional Protocol I”) is a 1977 amendment to the Geneva Convention that focuses on the protection of victims of international armed conflicts.¹³ Protocol I calls for the protection and care of the wounded, sick, and shipwrecked regardless of whether they are military or civilians.¹⁴ To protect civilians from unnecessary injury or death, Protocol I obliges combatants to distinguish themselves from the civilian population while engaged ⁶ *Id.* ⁷ *Id.* ⁸ *Id.* ⁹ See Geneva Convention, *supra* note 2.\n¹⁰ *Id.* art. 3.\n¹¹ *Id.* art. 14.\n¹² *Id.* ¹³ Protocol I, *supra* note 1, art. 3.\n¹⁴ *Id.* in an attack.¹⁵ The civilian population is specifically protected under Part IV, which demands the parties to distinguish at all times between civilian populations and combatants; as well as between civilian objects and military objectives.¹⁶ Further, Protocol I provides that if there is doubt as to whether a person is a civilian, that person should be treated as a civilian.¹⁷ In addition, parties are prohibited from making the civilian population the object of an attack, or making acts or threats intended to terrorize the civilian population.¹⁸ Protocol I also protects civilians by prohibiting indiscriminate attacks such as those not directed at a specific military objective as well as the use of combat means that cannot be sufficiently limited.¹⁹ However, there are limits because the presence or movement of civilians will not render certain areas immune from military operations.²⁰ For example, if a party to the conflict uses a movement of civilians to shield military objects, that party would be in violation of the Protocol. The purpose of the Additional Protocol is to protect civilians during armed conflicts, so a State using civilians as shields will be held accountable for the LOAC violation. In addition, the Hague Convention states that the right of belligerents to adopt means of injuring the enemy is not unlimited.²¹ By limiting the means used against the enemy, civilians are also protected from unnecessary suffering due to the type of weapons used in warfare.²² The purpose of the Hague Convention was to infuse humanity into armed conflicts.²³ By forcing States to use approved weapons, which take into account human suffering, civilians are indirectly protected from inhumane weaponry.\nProtocol I requires precautionary measures to be taken during [Vol. XLII attack planning to limit the injury and death of civilians, as well as damage to civilian objects.²⁴ Specifically, Article 57 instructs parties to take constant care in military operations to spare civilians and civilian objects by requiring parties to verify objectives to be attacked and to take all feasible precautions to avoid and minimize incidental loss of civilian life or injury.²⁵ The parties must also refrain from launching any attack that may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, civilian injury, or loss of civilian property.²⁶ Further, parties are required to cancel or suspend attacks if it becomes clear the objective is not a military one or that the attack will cause loss of civilian life or property or will cause civilian injuries.²⁷ Protocol I also requires parties, to the maximum extent feasible, remove civilians and civilian objects from the vicinity of military objects.²⁸ In addition, parties are to avoid locating military objects within or near densely populated areas.²⁹ The purpose of these measures are to ensure States are being mindful of civilians and civilian property from the beginning of attack planning all the way through the attacks themselves.³⁰ ## B. Civilians Directly Participating in Hostilities Protocol I protects civilians when viewed as innocent bystanders, but what if civilians participate in hostilities? Under the Protocol, parties to an international armed conflict may only target civilians for such time as the civilians take a direct part in hostilities.³¹ At that point, the civilians lose their civilian status protection and can then be targeted by combatants as legally permissible. The timeframe for which civilians can be targeted while directly participating in hostilities is defined by Protocol I as the time during which they are participating.³² However, it is important to keep in mind that the right of the noncombatant population to protection involves a corresponding duty to abstain from hostilities.³³ As an example, if a civilian who is caught in the middle of an international armed conflict decides to pick up a rifle and shoot at a Party to the conflict, the Party’s armed force may target the civilian so long as the civilian poses a threat. If the civilian were to drop the rifle and run back to his house, he could no longer be targeted by the armed force. The targeting of civilians while directly participating in hostilities is rooted in LOAC; any potential domestic law violations would be determined by the civilian’s State. Civilians directly participating in hostilities may face repercussions based on their actions that violate domestic criminal laws as well as being targeted by the enemy State. The Third Geneva Convention also addresses civilians participating in hostilities.\nThe Third Geneva Convention (“Convention”) was adopted in 1949, and its purpose was the protection of the victims of war, both civilian and prisoner.³⁴ This Convention mainly addresses the treatment of prisoners of war, but it also recognizes civilian participation in hostilities.³⁵ Under this Convention, *levée en masse* is the spontaneous taking up of arms by civilian inhabitants of a non-occupied territory when the invading enemy approaches.³⁶ In this case, the civilians would be allowed prisoner-of-war status because they participated in hostilities spontaneously, without the time to form themselves into regular armed units; but they must carry arms openly and respect the laws of war.³⁷ Aside from prisoner of war status, LOAC also addresses combatant immunity and targetability.³⁸ Combatant immunity is addressed in Protocol I, wherein it states that members of a Party’s armed force are combatants, and ³³ Karma Nabulsi, *Evolving Conceptions of Civilians and Belligerents: One Hundred Years After the Hague Peace Conferences, in CIVILIANS IN WAR 9, 16* (Simon Chesterman ed., 2001) (quoting Henry Richmond Droop, *On the Relations Between an Invading Army and the Inhabitants, and the Conditions Under Which Irregular Troops Are Entitled to the Same Treatment as Regular Soldiers*, TRANSACTIONS OF THE GROTIUS SOCIETY 713 (1871)).\n³⁴ Geneva Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War art. 4, Aug. 12, 1949, 6 U.S.T. 3316, 75 U.N.T.S. 135 [hereinafter Geneva POW].\n³⁵ *Id.* ³⁶ *Id.* ³⁷ *Id.* ³⁸ See Protocol I, supra note 1.\n\n[Vol. XLII] they have the right to participate directly in hostilities.³⁹ The term “combatant” excludes medical personnel, chaplains, and civilians.⁴⁰ Accordingly, in international armed conflict, combatants enjoy immunity regarding their acts as part of hostilities, but it does not prohibit others from engaging in those types of hostilities. Although non-combatants are not specifically prohibited from engaging in hostilities during an armed conflict, they may be directly targeted by the enemy and may face domestic criminal charges for their actions. Therefore, civilians engaging in hostilities would not be entitled to the combatant immunity that is given to combatants participating in an international armed conflict. Thus, civilians would only be entitled to prisoner of war status in limited cases, and they would not be entitled to combatant immunity.\nRegarding targetability, civilians are not to be targeted by the parties to an armed conflict, and civilians are to be generally protected against the dangers arising from military operations.⁴¹ However, LOAC allows civilians to be targeted by an armed force if and for so long as the civilian is directly participating in hostilities.⁴² Therefore, civilians enjoy the freedom from targetability so long as they are not taking a direct part in the hostilities. This freedom from direct targetability extends to a point under LOAC. A State choosing to target a legal military objective must determine if civilians and their property may be damaged by the attack.⁴³ If so, the State must conduct a balancing test to ensure the necessity of taking out the military objective outweighs the possible damage that could be caused to civilians and their property.⁴⁴ In summation, civilians do not have combatant immunity, they may be granted prisoner of war status during a levée en masse, and they cannot be directly targeted unless they are directly participating in hostilities.⁴⁵ Even with the existence of International Humanitarian Law (“IHL”) seeking to protect civilians during times of war, civilians still experience loss. IHL exists with the purpose of protecting civilians during an ongoing armed conflict, but civilians can still be legally killed or injured.⁴⁶ If done according to the Geneva Conventions’ rules of discrimination and proportionality, nations may still strike enemy targets that lead to the loss of limbs, lives, and loved ones for civilians.⁴⁷ As examples, fighter jets can strike a weapons cache next to an apartment complex, a convoy can speed through a school playground,⁴⁸ and combatants can return fire in a crowded street. Aside from a country’s stance on ethics in times of war, the plight of civilians has practical drawbacks, such as the hatred survivors have toward foreign governments and protests following civilian casualties.⁴⁹ The United States military came to understand that it is important to win the hearts and minds of the civilian population in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.⁵⁰ Based on the implications that the United States was callously indifferent regarding civilian casualties, it started tracking the damage it caused and responded directly to affected families.⁵¹ The efforts by the U.S. government to recognize the importance of paying respect to the families of injured or killed civilians is another step toward protecting civilians during times of war.\nInternational Humanitarian Law provides the basis for the protection of civilians during an ongoing armed conflict, but does that translate from the physical world to the cyber world? The cyberspace domain offers capabilities that are far different from the physical domain. Cyberspace provides the cloak of anonymity that may shield civilians and even States from being identified as the responsible party for cyber operations. The protections afforded to civilians have been roughly translated from the physical to the cyber domain by the Tallinn Manual’s International Group of Experts as well as Guidance by the International Committee of the Red Cross.\n### III. The Current Treatment of Civilians in the Cyberspace ⁴⁶ *Id.* ⁴⁷ Sarah Holewinski, *Do Less Harm: Protecting and Compensating Civilians in War*, FOREIGN AFF., Jan.–Feb. 2013, at 14.\n⁴⁸ *Id.* ⁴⁹ *Id.* ⁵⁰ *Id.* ⁵¹ *Id.* [Vol. XLII ## Domain Civilians enjoy very much the same protections in the cyberspace domain as they do in the physical domain. The Tallinn Manual states that civilians are defined in the cyberspace domain as they are under the Additional Protocol I of the Geneva Convention.⁵² Specifically, civilians are defined in terms of neither being members of armed forces nor members of a *levée en masse*.⁵³ As such, individual civilians, as well as civilian populations, shall not be the object of a cyber-attack by a party to the armed conflict.⁵⁴ A cyber-attack is any cyber operation or activity that is reasonably expected to cause injury or death to a person or the damage or destruction to objects.⁵⁵ In addition, LOAC applies to the targeting of people or objects during an armed conflict regardless of the means or methods of warfare that are used.⁵⁶ These seemingly broad definitions are key to protecting civilians during armed conflicts because parties to the conflict are held accountable for actions taken which are incompatible with the law of war.\n## A. Cyber Operations and the Law of Armed Conflict Defining cyber warfare, as a whole, is better understood by looking at its component parts. Cyberspace, in general, is the domain within the information environment made up of the interdependent network of information technology infrastructures and the resident data.⁵⁷ Cyber warfare can be viewed as a combined concept of cyberspace operations, offensive cyberspace operations, and defensive cyberspace operations.⁵⁸ Cyber operations are the employment of cyberspace capabilities where the primary purpose is to achieve objectives in and through ⁵² TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE 104-05 (Michael N. Schmitt, ed. 2013) [hereinafter TALLINN MANUAL].\n⁵³ *Id.* ⁵⁴ *Id.* at 113–14.\n⁵⁵ *Id.* at 106–10.\n⁵⁶ *Id.* at 104–05.\n⁵⁷ *Cyber*, DICTIONARY OF MILITARY AND ASSOCIATED TERMS, U.S. DEP’T DEFENSE 57–58 (8 Nov. 2010 as amended through 15 Feb. 2016), http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/new_pubs/jp1_02.pdf [https://perma.cc/5UH8-B36A].\n⁵⁸ *Id.* cyberspace.⁵⁹ Offensive cyberspace operations are those intended to project power by the application of force in and through cyberspace.⁶⁰ Defensive cyberspace operations are the passive and active cyberspace operations carried out to preserve the ability to use friendly cyberspace capabilities to protect data, networks, and other systems.⁶¹ Examples of cyber warfare include the gaining of access to a computer system to acquire control over it, transmission of viruses to destroy or alter data, use of logic bombs to sit idle in a system until a set time or occurrence, and insertion of a worm to reproduce until a system is overloaded.⁶² Understanding cyber warfare allows for a better understanding of how the LOAC principles are to be applied in the cyber domain.\nThe LOAC principles of proportionality, humanity, military necessity, and distinction apply to States operating in cyberspace in very much the same way as they apply in the physical domains.⁶³ However, conducting operations in the cyber domain complicates the process because the operations are being carried out in an environment that is unreal and inherently unstable.⁶⁴ Targeting for computer network attacks presents legal issues that are just as complex as physical attacks.⁶⁵ Accordingly, States must exercise caution when planning and carrying out operations in cyberspace to ensure civilians are being protected. To do so, States conduct network reconnaissance for both operational requirements, as well as to ensure planned attacks do not cause collateral damage and casualties outside of what is acceptable under LOAC principles.⁶⁶ ⁵⁹ Id.\n⁶⁰ Id.\n⁶¹ Id.\n⁶² David Turns, *Cyber Warfare and the Notion of Direct Participation in Hostilities*, 17 J.

INT’L L. 391 (2010).\n⁶⁶ Id.\n\n[Vol. XLII There are some scholars and experts who view cyber operations as falling outside of the reach of the UN Charter or LOAC. Due to the UN Charter being written long before the advent of the Internet, the UN Charter was not written with a clear intention of including cyber operations.⁶⁷ Scholars and experts adhering to this view believe the UN Charter encompasses only physical attacks, and cyber operations will almost certainly not involve the use of physical force.⁶⁸ According to this line of thought, a country would not violate LOAC by deliberately launching cyber operations at civilian-owned targets.⁶⁹ However, the Tallinn Manual examines cyber operations as falling under the UN Charter and being subject to LOAC.⁷⁰ The LOAC principle of distinction, as codified in Additional Protocol I, and incorporated into the Tallinn Manual, requires that parties to an armed conflict distinguish between the civilian population and combatants, as well as between civilian objects and military objectives.⁷¹ This requirement seeks to protect civilians and their property by holding the parties to armed conflict accountable for the targets they choose to attack. Further, the principle of distinction precludes any rationale or justification by a party for an attack not permitted by LOAC.⁷² In cases where there is doubt as to whether a person is a civilian in the cyber domain, that person shall be considered a civilian.⁷³ This requirement complicates the cyber battlefield, because there are many civilians using computers and computer networks, and it may be very difficult to discern who is and is not a civilian.\nDetermining whether actors in the cyberspace domain are civilians, and may possibly be targeted when directly participating in hostilities during an international armed conflict, is difficult. Inaccurate attribution in cyberspace may leave vulnerable the civilians caught in the crossfire. The International Court of Justice maintains high standards for requisite attribution of an armed attack, and in the cyber domain, attribution for the act and actor ⁶⁷ See Cyber, supra note 57.\n⁶⁸ Id.\n⁶⁹ Id.\n⁷⁰ See TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 52.\n⁷¹ Geneva Convention, supra note 2, art. 14; Geneva POW, supra note 34, art. 4.\n⁷² TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 52, at Rule 33.\n⁷³ Id.\n\nare difficult to prove with scientific certainty.⁷⁴ Further, this attribution on the Internet is “the most technologically challenging level of attribution,” because the attributing party is seeking “to determine the original individual or entity that is responsible for launching the attack.”⁷⁵ In the United States, the White House, State Department, and Department of Defense recognize the need to treat cyber operations as potentially falling under the UN Charter and requiring a LOAC determination prior to employment.⁷⁶ Specifically, there is concern from these agencies that the use of cyber weapons could trigger unintended consequences and might harm diplomatic relations.⁷⁷ Senior military officials have stated that attribution of cyber-attacks has remained a challenge, and that challenge factors into the difficulty of determining what constitutes a cyber act of war.⁷⁸ Further, the National Security Director and U.S. Cyber Command chief has stated that the United States needs to think outside of the cyber realm regarding retaliation, and it needs to define acceptability limits regarding hacking.⁷⁹ In addition, the United States needs to prepare a set of capabilities and show its determination for using them.⁸⁰ Members of the U.S. Congress have echoed the need for cyber deterrence ⁷⁴ See Jason F.

The Objects of Cyber Attacks The Tallinn Manual also discusses who may be made the object of cyber-attacks and lists them as: 1) members of the armed forces; 2) members of organized armed groups; 3) civilians taking a direct part in hostilities; and 4) participants in a *levée en masse* during an international armed conflict.⁸⁷ It should be noted that the first two categories can be made the object of an attack based on their status; however, the last two categories can only be made targets based on their actions. Members of organized armed ⁸¹ *Id.* ⁸² *Id.* ⁸³ Patrick Tucker, *NSA Chief: Rules of War Apply to Cyberwar*, Too, DEF.

Inhabitants of unoccupied territory during an international armed conflict who engage in cyber operations as part of a levée en masse are afforded combatant immunity and prisoner of war status.⁹³ In addition, participants in a cyber-based levée en masse are targetable throughout the period of their participation therein.⁹⁴ To be considered a levée en masse, the participating individuals must be inhabitants of non-occupied territory, who upon the invading enemy’s approach, take up arms to resist them.⁹⁵ In the cyber context, “taking up arms” refers to engaging in cyber operations against the enemy.⁹⁶ This “taking up arms” in cyberspace is theoretical based on the facts that would have to exist for a cyber levée en masse to be ⁸⁸ *Id.* ⁸⁹ *Id.* ⁹⁰ Nils Melzer, *Interpretive Guidance on the Notion of Direct Participation Under International Humanitarian Law*, INT’L COMM. RED CROSS 1, 37 (2009), https://www.icrc.org/eng/assets/files/other/icrc-002-0990.pdf [https://perma.cc/N8G8-BMSB] (explaining particular difficulties relating to private contractors and civilian employees).\n⁹¹ *Id.* at Part I, 2, b.\n⁹² *Id.* at Part II, 1.\n⁹³ TALLINN MANUAL, *supra* note 52, at Rule 27.\n⁹⁴ *Id.* at Rule 34, comment 9.\n⁹⁵ *Id.* at Rule 27.\n⁹⁶ *Id.* [Vol. XLII] lawfully carried out.⁹⁷ In the physical world, the levée en masse occurs when the enemy invades, and the inhabitants take on arms to defend themselves without being organized.⁹⁸ However, this levée en masse is still required to carry arms openly and respect the laws and customs of war, though they are not required to wear identifying attire.⁹⁹ In the cyber domain, a levée en masse could occur if, in response to a physical invasion, members of the population spontaneously mount cyber operations against the invaders.¹⁰⁰ Further, the International Group of Experts are divided as to whether levée en masse privileges can apply to a civilian population engaged in countering a massive cyber-attack in lieu of a physical invasion.¹⁰¹ In general, civilians should be protected in the cyberspace domain in much the same way as they are protected in the physical domains. The difference is the virtually untested nature of the cyberspace domain. It remains unclear exactly how States are to behave in cyberspace, what rises to the level of a cyber-attack, and what level of physical domain response is authorized for a particular cyber-attack. These and other unresolved translations from the physical realm to the cyber domain make difficult the protection of civilians during an international armed conflict. A step further would be the impact on civilians when they decide to directly participate in cyber hostilities.\n## IV. Civilians Directly Participating in Hostilities in the Cyberspace Domain The Tallinn Manual provides that, based on LOAC principles, there is no bar of any category of person from participating in cyber operations, whether during an international or non-international armed conflict.¹⁰² However, civilians participating in an armed conflict through cyber operations would likely not be entitled to prisoner of war status and combatant immunity, and they could be targeted based on their participation.¹⁰³ The ⁹⁷ *Id.* ⁹⁸ Geneva POW, *supra* note 34, art. 4.\n⁹⁹ *Id.* ¹⁰⁰ *Id.* ¹⁰¹ *Id.* ¹⁰² TALLINN MANUAL, *supra* note 52, at Rule 25.\n¹⁰³ *Id.* at Rule 25, comment 2.\n\nentitlement to combatant immunity and prisoner of war status are dependent upon the individual being engaged in an international armed conflict, as opposed to solely a non-international armed conflict or actions not rising to the level of armed conflict.¹⁰⁴ Even if civilians participate in hostilities, the majority of the International Group of Experts agree that civilians retain their civilian status.¹⁰⁵ However, civilians remain subject to prosecution under the applicable domestic laws of the States capturing them.¹⁰⁶ ## A. Defining Direct Participation in Hostilities As previously mentioned, civilians can be made the object of cyber-attacks if they are directly taking part in hostilities. Though civilians are protected from attack during international armed conflicts, they lose that protection if and for so long as they directly participate in hostilities.¹⁰⁷ This protection from attack and subsequent loss of protection only applies to civilians; it does not apply to members of armed forces, organized armed groups, or participants in a *levée en masse*.¹⁰⁸ Further, members of groups failing to qualify as organized armed groups would also qualify as civilians under this rule.¹⁰⁹ For example, a group would fail to be recognized as an organized armed group if they lack the required level of organization or if they fail to maintain a continuous combat function.¹¹⁰ Conducting operations in cyberspace that may rise to the level of direct participation in hostilities can be better understood by looking at the functions or tasks carried out in the cyber domain. Those involved in cyber operations seemingly fall in to three main categories according to their functions: 1) those who design or write the programs used for offense or defensive cyber operations; 2) those who install these programs on computer systems, act as service administrators, and provide technical maintenance; and 3) ¹⁰⁴ *Id.* at Rule 25.\n¹⁰⁵ *Id.* at Rule 29.\n¹⁰⁶ *Id.* at Rule 29.\n¹⁰⁷ *Id.* at Rules 32, 35.\n¹⁰⁸ Geneva POW, *supra* note 34, art. 4; TALLINN MANUAL, *supra* note 52, at Rule 35.\n¹⁰⁹ *Id.* ¹¹⁰ *Id.* art. 4; Melzer, *supra* note 90, at Part I.2.b.\n\n[Vol. XLII those who actually operate the computer programs.¹¹¹ A lone civilian could presumably be filling all of these roles in a solo operation.\nWhen civilians directly participate in hostilities through cyber operations during an international armed conflict, they are liable to be attacked either through cyber means or other lawful means under LOAC.¹¹² IHL does not define direct participation in hostilities, so direct participation must be interpreted in good faith according to the ordinary meaning and the context based on the object and purpose of IHL.¹¹³ Treaty law in this area refers to hostilities in terms of international or non-international armed conflict, so that should be the threshold; hostilities cannot refer to internal disturbances, riots, or isolated and sporadic events.¹¹⁴ Not all conduct during an armed conflict constitutes part of hostilities.¹¹⁵ Civilian participation in hostilities can occur in various forms and intensity levels in a wide variety of geographical, cultural, political, and military contexts, so the circumstances at the relevant time and place of the hostilities should be examined.¹¹⁶ The direct participation in hostilities refers to specific acts, which are carried out by individuals as part of the hostilities between two parties in an armed conflict.¹¹⁷ There are therefore two elements: 1) direct participation; and 2) hostilities. Participation in hostilities can either be direct or indirect; direct participation is the engagement in specific hostile acts.¹¹⁸ The concept of hostilities is best described as the aggregate of all hostile acts carried out by all individuals, either armed forces, organized armed groups, or civilians, during an armed conflict.¹¹⁹ The specific acts carried out by civilians qualify as direct participation in hostilities if they meet all of the following criteria: ¹¹¹ Cyber, supra note 57.\n¹¹² Geneva POW, supra note 34, art. 4; TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 52, at Rule 35.\n¹¹³ Melzer, supra note 90, at Part II.B.\n¹¹⁴ Id.\n¹¹⁵ Id.\n¹¹⁶ Id.\n¹¹⁷ Id. at Part VI.\n¹¹⁸ Id.\n¹¹⁹ Melzer, supra note 90, at Part VI.\n\nIn addition to meeting the threshold of harm, the second criterion requires there also be a direct causal link between the act and the harm. For there to be direct causation, there must be a sufficiently close causal relationship between the act and the resulting harm.¹²³ Specifically, direct causation should be brought about in one causal step.¹²⁴ Individual actions that can be viewed as merely supporting one side to an armed conflict or that only build up or maintain the capacity of a party is excluded from the concept of direct participation in hostilities.¹²⁵ For example, providing supplies for a party or financing the actions of a party to an armed conflict would bring about a result, but there is not direct causation for the potential harm. Other examples of indirect participation would be scientific research and design, recruitment and the training of personnel, and the production or transportation of weapons or equipment.¹²⁶ The third criterion requires there be a belligerent nexus, which is that an act must be specifically designed to directly cause the required threshold of harm in support of a party to the armed conflict.¹²⁷ Accordingly, the act must be objectively likely to inflict harm, and it must be specifically designed to do so in ¹²⁰ *Id.* at Part V.\n¹²¹ *Id.* ¹²² *Id.* ¹²³ *Id.* at Part V.2.b.\n¹²⁴ *Id.* at Part V.2.f.\n¹²⁵ Melzer, *supra* note 90, at Part V.\n¹²⁶ *Id.* at Part V.2.b.\n¹²⁷ *Id.* at Part V.3.\n\n[Vol. XLII] support of a party to the armed conflict.¹²⁸ Therefore, violence that is not designed to harm a party to an armed conflict cannot amount to direct participation in hostilities.¹²⁹ This type of violence is left solely to domestic law enforcement measures and not LOAC or IHL. The belligerent nexus requirement is important, because there are many activities during armed conflict that cause a considerable level of harm but fall short of direct participation in hostilities. This is exemplified by violent crimes committed for reasons unrelated to the conflict, such as robberies or murders, as well as the theft of military equipment for private use or sale.¹³⁰ Also requiring special attention is use of individual self-defense or defense of others. If a civilian uses force to protect his property from looting, he is not doing so with a belligerent nexus.¹³¹ Instead, he is acting out of self-defense.\nUnderstanding whether hostilities by civilians during armed conflict rise to the level of direct participation is not enough. The defining moment of when the direct participation in hostilities begins and ends is also important. Preparatory measures leading up to the execution of the specific act, and the movement to and from the location of the execution, all constitute integral parts of the act.¹³² Accordingly, IHL concerns itself with more than just exactly when the act took place; it looks at the totality of the circumstances surrounding the civilian’s direct participation in hostilities.¹³³ This is a significant point, because civilians lose their protection against direct attacks for such time as they directly participate in hostilities.¹³⁴ Preparatory measures are those that IHL would describe as military operations in preparation for an attack and which are so closely linked to the execution of the specific act that they constitute an integral part of the act.¹³⁵ Even so, there is no requirement that the preparatory measures occur immediately prior to the specific act or even in close geographic proximity to the place of the specific act.¹³⁶ An example in the physical domain would be a civilian who builds a bomb in his garage, which he intends to place in the road in order to blow it up and injure armed forces during an international armed conflict. In this illustration, the preparatory measures taken by the civilian bomb maker in his garage, as well as the transit to and from the place where he plants the bomb, would all be considered part of the direct participation in hostilities. Thus, the bomb maker could be targeted at any point from when he starts building the bomb in his garage until he returns home from planting it. Also included in general preparatory measures would be the transporting of personnel, gathering of intelligence, and equipping and instructing armed forces.¹³⁷ Where the execution of a hostile act does not require deployment, such as hostilities in cyberspace, the duration of the act should be limited to the immediate execution of the act.¹³⁸ ## B. Tallinn Manual View of Direct Participation in Hostilities The Tallinn Manual’s International Group of Experts generally agrees with the three cumulative criteria for qualification as a direct participation in hostilities as applied to cyberspace.¹³⁹ First, there must be a threshold of harm, wherein the civilian has the intended or actual effect of negatively affecting the military operations or capabilities of a party to an armed conflict or inflicting death, physical harm, or material destruction on persons or objects protected against direct attack.¹⁴⁰ Physical damage to objects or harm to individuals is not required, so long as the cyber act negatively affects the party militarily.¹⁴¹ Second, there must be a direct causal link between the act and the harm intended.¹⁴² An example would be a civilian conducting cyber acts against an armed force in international armed conflict, wherein the civilian disrupts the command and control, even temporarily, for the armed force. Finally, there must be a belligerent nexus established by the ¹³⁶ *Id.* ¹³⁷ *Id.* ¹³⁸ Melzer, *supra* note 90, at Part VI.\n¹³⁹ TALLINN MANUAL, *supra* note 52, at Rule 35, comment 4.\n¹⁴⁰ *Id.* ¹⁴¹ *Id.* ¹⁴² *Id.* [Vol. XLII act directly relating to the hostilities.¹⁴³ In cyberspace, direct participation in hostilities by civilians may be more difficult to delineate. Determining whether a civilian directly participated in conventional hostilities is complex by itself; making the same determination in cyber-hostilities is especially so.¹⁴⁴ Civilians conducting cyber-attacks related to an armed conflict would qualify as an act of direct participation in hostilities.¹⁴⁵ A cyber-attack is defined as a cyber operation that is reasonably expected to cause injury or death to persons or damage or destruction to objects.¹⁴⁶ Accordingly, civilians conducting cyber-attacks in this way would meet the three criteria for directly participating in hostilities. Other examples of direct participation include civilians conducting cyber operations with the intent to identify vulnerabilities in a targeted computer network or system, or civilians designing malware to take advantage of vulnerabilities in the systems of a party to an armed conflict.¹⁴⁷ Further examples in the cyber domain include civilians using cyber means to gather information on enemy operations and passing that information to the other armed force in the conflict as well as conducting distributed denial of service operations against military systems.¹⁴⁸ On the other hand, not all cyber operations by civilians would rise to the level of direct participation in hostilities. For example, designing malware for a specific purpose and making it available online, even if it is actually used by someone else to conduct an attack during an armed conflict, would not be considered direct participation.¹⁴⁹ What would be lacking would be the threshold of harm in the first criterion; the malware creator never had the intended or actual effect of negatively affecting military operations or capabilities. Another example would be civilians simply maintaining computer equipment generally, even if that equipment were eventually used in hostilities.¹⁵⁰ Again, what would be ¹⁴³ *Id.* ¹⁴⁴ Emily Crawford, *Virtual Battlegrounds: Direct Participation in Cyber Warfare*, 9 J. L. &amp; POL’Y INFO. SOC’Y 1 (2013).\n¹⁴⁵ TALLINN MANUAL, *supra* note 52, at Rule 35, comment 5.\n¹⁴⁶ *Id.* at Rule 30.\n¹⁴⁷ *Id.* at Rule 35, comment 5.\n¹⁴⁸ *Id.* ¹⁴⁹ *Id.* ¹⁵⁰ *Id.* missing is the threshold of harm at the first criterion.\nThe first criterion of the threshold of harm would also disqualify other cyber operations taken during an armed conflict. Cyber operations during an armed conflict that are taken for purely criminal or private reasons would not qualify as direct participation in hostilities.¹⁵¹ As an example, a criminal using cyber means to steal funds from a party to a conflict for purely personal gain, and not to negatively affect the party, would not be directly participating in hostilities. What is difficult about this example is that the party to the armed conflict would have to determine the intent of the civilian actor, which could be disguised as purely personal and criminal when it could in fact be aimed at adversely affecting the party to the conflict. Taken a step further, if the individual stole the money from the party in order to finance particular military operations, the operation to steal the money would be considered a direct participation in hostilities.¹⁵² Preparatory measures in cyberspace differ from those taken in the physical domain. Because civilians can be directly targeted for the duration of time during which they are directly participating in hostilities, it is important for parties to an armed conflict to understand the timeframe of direct participation.¹⁵³ The actions taken in cyberspace immediately preceding or subsequent to a qualifying act of direct participation are included in the preparatory measures.¹⁵⁴ As an example, a civilian travelling to and from the location of the computer he uses to mount a cyber operation would be included in the preparatory measures, and the civilian could be directly targeted in transit.¹⁵⁵ The time for preparatory measures may even extend as far backward and forward in time as the causal link to the action exists.¹⁵⁶ For example, in a cyber operation this would include the time when the civilian first starts to explore the vulnerabilities of the system of a party to an armed conflict, the time the individual creates the cyber tool to exploit the vulnerabilities, the period of time the civilian attacks the system, and through to the time the individual assesses ¹⁵¹ TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 52, at Rule 35, comment 6.\n¹⁵² Id.\n¹⁵³ Id.\n¹⁵⁴ Id. at Rule 35, comment 7.\n¹⁵⁵ Id.\n¹⁵⁶ Id.\n\n[Vol. XLII the damage to the system.\nIn addition to the preparatory measures taken for a cyber operation, parties to an armed conflict must take into account the delayed effects of direct participation in hostilities by civilians. The actions taken by civilians in the cyber domain have some parallels to the physical domain, but they also vary widely. The emplacement of a logic bomb, which is designed to activate at some point in the future upon either a command or after a predetermined period of time, is an example.¹⁵⁷ The majority of the Tallinn Manual’s International Group of Experts takes the position that the time frame for which the civilian is directly participating, and can thus be targeted, is from the beginning of his involvement in mission planning until the individual terminates his active role in the operation.¹⁵⁸ It is important to point out that the end of the period of direct participation may not sync up with the point when the damage occurs.¹⁵⁹ For example, the first civilian may have created and emplaced the logic bomb, which is awaiting a command prompt to activate it. A second civilian may be the one to actually command the bomb to activate. In this example, the first civilian could have halted his period of direct participation and would no longer be directly targetable when the damage actually occurs. Thus, the key is for parties to determine when individuals are targetable based on when their participation begins and ends.¹⁶⁰ ## C. Determination of Direct Participation in Hostilities Complicated by Cyberspace-Specific Issues The delayed effects of cyber operations complicate the accurate determination of precisely when a civilian is directly participating in cyber hostilities. The majority of the International Group of Experts takes the position that a civilian is directly participating in hostilities from the beginning of his involvement through the point in time where the civilian terminates an active role in the operation.¹⁶¹ The problem with this majority view is that it does not make clear to the participating civilian or to the ¹⁵⁷ TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 52, at Rule 35, comment 8.\n¹⁵⁸ Id.\n¹⁵⁹ Id.\n¹⁶⁰ Id.\n¹⁶¹ Id. at Rule 35, comment 6.\n\nState being attacked the window of time during which the civilian may be directly and legally targeted. The civilian may terminate an active role by no longer checking the status of the ongoing cyber operation, but the State may still attribute the operation to the civilian and target him. The State may not discover the ongoing cyber operation until after the civilian has terminated an active role, but the State has no way of knowing the civilian has terminated his active role in the ongoing cyber operation.\nThe logic bomb example parallels civilian operations in the physical world. Coalition Forces fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan faced road-side improvised explosive devices (“IEDs”), which were responsible for causing death and injury to troops as well as damage to military objects. If a civilian was responsible for building, transporting, emplacing, and setting off the IED, the civilian could be targeted throughout the entire process.¹⁶² The beginning and end of the civilian’s direct participation in hostilities could be measured from the time he began sourcing parts for the bomb until the time he set off the IED and transited back from the bombsite. Similarly, the civilian responsible for the logic bomb in the aforementioned example could be targeted from the time he began creating the logic bomb until he commands the logic bomb to activate. However, technology in the cyber domain varies widely from technology in the physical domain.\nIn the cyber domain, individuals can create programs capable of running autonomously or semi-autonomously. A computer network attack (“CAN”) is defined as either a cyber, electronic, or physical attack against an information technology facility or against computer equipment.¹⁶³ Most of these CNAs are carried out by cyber operations, which use malicious code to infect enemy computers in order to exploit weaknesses in software, system configuration, or computer security practices.¹⁶⁴ Cyber operations also include the use of bots, or remotely, or semi-autonomously controlled programs infecting computers, as well as botnets, which perform espionage by transmitting data between themselves while ¹⁶² *Id.* at Rule 35, comment 4 (providing that there is well-known, ongoing debate as to whether the assembly of an IED qualifies as direct participation in hostilities).\n¹⁶³ See generally CLAY WILSON, COMPUTER ATTACK AND CYBERTERRORISM 3-11 (2009) (providing insight on different types of attacks against computers).\n¹⁶⁴ *Id.* [Vol. XLII awaiting the final activation signal from the operator.¹⁶⁵ Malicious programs, such as spyware and malware, attack by disrupting normal computer functions or by opening a back door for a remote operator to take control of the computer.¹⁶⁶ Cyber operators have designed computer exploits which launch anonymously from thousands of infected computers and which produce waves of disruption to overwhelm the target of the operation.¹⁶⁷ The technology allowing autonomous and semi-autonomous operations in cyberspace makes difficult the task of determining the beginning and ending points of direct participation by civilians.¹⁶⁸ A minority of the Tallinn Manual Group of Experts would break down the various steps in cyber operations such as the emplacement of the logic bomb and its activation as separate acts of direct participation.¹⁶⁹ Under this view, the civilian would only directly participate in hostilities in intermittent instances when he is actively engaged in hostilities.¹⁷⁰ This view provides greater protection to civilians, as they are shielded from directly being targeted except for the times when they are actively engaged in cyber operations.¹⁷¹ However, this view would make it very difficult for the parties engaged in armed conflict to accurately determine when civilians are directly participating and then target the civilians participating in hostilities at precisely those times. The Group of Experts is split regarding repeated cyber operations. One view is in line with the ICRC in that each cyber act must be treated separately in terms of direct participation analysis.¹⁷² On the other hand, another view is that it would make more operational sense if direct participation begins with the first cyber operation and continues throughout the period of intermittent activity.¹⁷³ The latter view removes the “revolving door” effect and simplifies target ability by making the intermittent activity a singular, start-to-finish cyber operation.\n\nThe Tallinn Experts were also divided over the issue of presumption against direct participation.¹⁷⁴ Recall that the Tallinn Manual provides that in cases where there is doubt as to whether an individual is a civilian, that individual should be treated like a civilian.¹⁷⁵ The policy behind this principle is to ensure that civilians are protected to the utmost extent during armed conflicts. Some Tallinn Experts take this same line of thinking regarding civilians believed to be directly participating in hostilities.¹⁷⁶ These experts believe civilians in this predicament should be given the benefit of the doubt.¹⁷⁷ However, other Tallinn Experts take the position that when there is doubt as to whether a civilian is directly participating in hostilities, the attacking state must review the relevant information available and act reasonably in the circumstances in determining whether to conduct the attack.¹⁷⁸ The policy behind this method rests in the attacking state’s ability to identify which targets are legal targets based on a reasonable review of the available information. The importance of these two views cannot be understated. Some experts side with protecting civilians to the maximum extent possible, while others favor the States’ ability to act while following LOAC principles.\nAlthough the Tallinn Manual agrees with ICRC Guidance’s requirements of a threshold of harm—a causal link between the action and the harm and a belligerent nexus—generally, the Tallinn Manual’s application of the ICRC’s guidance is a variation of the ICRC’s direct participation in hostilities legal regime involving cyber actions.¹⁷⁹ The Tallinn manual does not have a requirement for physical damage to objects, so actions that may not qualify as cyber-attacks may still satisfy the criterion for the threshold of harm if the action has negatively affected the targeted State.¹⁸⁰ Specifically, the Tallinn Manual provides that a civilian’s ¹⁷⁴ Id. at Rule 35, comment 12.\n¹⁷⁵ TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 52, at Rule 33.\n¹⁷⁶ Id. at Rule 35, comment 12.\n¹⁷⁷ Id.\n¹⁷⁸ Id.\n¹⁷⁹ See Collin Allan, Direct Participation in Hostilities from Cyberspace, 50 VA.

For example, a civilian may be directly targeted under the Tallinn Manual view for his role in assembling and storing the cyber equivalent of an IED because the individual intends the same harm as the person arming and detonating it.¹⁸⁶ By comparing the Tallinn Manual’s view with the ICRC Guidance, it is possible that the Tallinn Manual lowers the standards for what is required for civilians to be directly participating in cyber hostilities.¹⁸⁷ Therefore, civilians participating in hostilities through cyber means may be targetable in more situations than under the ICRC framework.¹⁸⁸ ## V.

That is, they are defined as neither members of the armed forces, which includes groups assimilated to the armed forces such as organized armed groups, nor those participating in a levée en masse.¹⁸⁹ Essentially, all others are considered civilians. Private contractors and employees of a party to an armed conflict who fit the definition of civilians are entitled to protection from being directly targeted, unless they are directly participating in hostilities.¹⁹⁰ In addition, private contractors and civilian employees are not entitled to combatant immunity, as they are not members of the armed force.¹⁹¹ The activities carried out by contractors and employees as well as their location of duty may expose them to an increased risk of death or injury even if they are not directly participating in hostilities.¹⁹²\n## A. State-Affiliated Civilians\nModern warfare is increasingly dependent upon private contractors and civilian employees to fill a variety of positions traditionally held by military personnel.¹⁹³ Generally, these private contractors and civilian employees are considered civilians under the same criteria that would apply to other civilians.¹⁹⁴ That is, they cannot be directly targeted by a party to the armed conflict unless and for so long as they directly participate in hostilities. Due to the special roles of private contractors and civilian employees and their proximity to armed forces in hostilities, parties to an armed conflict must make determinations regarding attacks with particular care and due consideration.¹⁹⁵\nThe majority of private contractors and civilian employees have been incorporated into State armed forces, but they do not\n---\n¹⁸⁹ See generally TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 52, Rule 29 (quoting the Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 Aug. 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts art. 50, § 1, June 8, 1977, 1125 U.N.T.S. 3).\n¹⁹⁰ Melzer, supra note 90.\n¹⁹¹ Id. at 38.\n¹⁹² Id. at 37.\n¹⁹³ Id.\n¹⁹⁴ Id.\n¹⁹⁵ Id.\n\n[Vol. XLII perform functions that would have them directly participate in hostilities.¹⁹⁶ Nevertheless, there are some contractor and civilians filling roles that would put them in situations where they could be seen as directly participating in hostilities. For example, private contractors and civilian employees that defend the base from attack could either be directly participating in hostilities or filling a law enforcement and defense-of-others role.¹⁹⁷ Even if they have accompanied armed forces, private contractors and civilians were never meant to (and should never be allowed to) directly participate in hostilities on behalf of a party to a conflict.¹⁹⁸ As long as they are not incorporated into armed forces, private contractors and civilian employees do not cease to be civilians, and they do not lose their civilian protection simply because they accompany armed forces.¹⁹⁹ Moreover, they do not lose their civilian protection just because they assume functions other than conducting hostilities, which traditionally would have been performed by members of armed forces.²⁰⁰ Contractors and civilian employees who directly participate in hostilities without the express authorization of the party to the armed conflict remain civilians, but they lose their protection from being directly targeted.²⁰¹ Contractors and employees can lose their civilian status if they have been incorporated into the armed forces of a party to a conflict.²⁰² If this happens, the contractors and employees would become members of an organized armed force under the command responsible for the party to the conflict and would no longer qualify as civilians.²⁰³ --- ¹⁹⁶ See Melzer, *supra* note 90, at 37 (explaining the basic notion of direct participation in hostilities).\n¹⁹⁷ See *id.* at 44 (illustrating that “[t]he notion of direct participation in hostilities does not refer to a person’s status, function, or affiliation, but to his or her engagement in specific hostile acts”).\n¹⁹⁸ *Id.* at 38.\n¹⁹⁹ *Id.* ²⁰⁰ *Id.* ²⁰¹ *Id.* ²⁰² See Melzer, *supra* note 90, at 39 (explaining that “[a]s long as they are not incorporated into the armed forces, private contractors and civilian employees do not cease to be civilians simply because they accompany the armed forces and or assume functions other than the conduct of hostilities that would traditionally have been performed by military personnel”).\n²⁰³ *Id.* The Tallinn Manual’s international group of experts concurs that individual contractors and civilians may only be directly targeted based on their direct participation in hostilities during an armed conflict.²⁰⁴ However, there are issues that arise in cyberspace regarding the use of contractors and civilians to perform specific military operations. Unlike traditional warfare, where almost all military operations were carried out by troops and equipment, modern warfare introduces the use of cyber capabilities which conduct a portion of the military operations. An example is the hiring of a private company by a party to an armed conflict that is later contracted to perform specific military operations.²⁰⁵ Based on the military operations, the company would qualify as an organized armed group belonging to the party to the conflict.²⁰⁶ Therefore, the civilians employed as private contractors would be considered belonging to the organized armed group. However, even if the civilians were not to be considered as belonging to the organized armed group, they would still only be directly targetable when and if they are directly participating in hostilities.²⁰⁷ Civilian government employees are also employed in positions requiring them to conduct cyber operations during an armed conflict, such as positions within an intelligence agency.²⁰⁸ If the group of civilians conducting cyber operations qualifies as an organized armed group, the civilian members are subject to attack regardless of direct participation in hostilities.²⁰⁹ Otherwise, the civilian employees are only directly targetable when they are directly participating in hostilities. As a result, the historic view of citizens carrying out actions typically performed by members of armed forces may be problematic when analyzing the cyber domain construct. The traditional view of warfare holds that private contractors and civilian employees operating in an organized armed group, affiliated with armed forces in an armed conflict, would not be entitled to combatant status.²¹⁰ [Vol. XLII] Furthermore, a party to the armed conflict employing civilians to perform intelligence functions, attack execution, or other CNA operations would violate the law of war.²¹¹ The reasoning behind this view is that only members of armed forces or assimilated organizations are granted combatant status because they meet the following conditions: (i) they are commanded by a person responsible for his subordinates; (ii) they have a fixed distinctive emblem recognizable at distance; (iii) they carry arms openly; and (iv) they conduct their operation in accordance with the laws and customs of war.²¹² Accordingly, under the traditional view, parties to an armed conflict should employ members of the armed force to carry out CNA functions, and if they desire contractors or civilian employees to fill these roles, then the parties should incorporate them into the regular armed forces.²¹³ Due to the vastly different landscape and operations carried out in cyberspace as opposed to the physical domain, a suggested course of action would be to rely less on the aforementioned four conditions and instead look to state affiliation.²¹⁴ The four criteria from the 1874 Brussels Declaration apply perfectly to traditional warfare, but operations in cyberspace are conducted without the need of having a fixed recognizable emblem or of carrying arms openly. By requiring state affiliation for civilian employees, it preserves concern for the principle of distinction in CNA from the Brussels criteria.²¹⁵ States employing civilians to conduct cyber operations are less likely to be doing so to prevent the enemy from attacking the civilians.²¹⁶ Instead, States are likely taking advantage of the economic, training, and recruiting advantages that develop as a result of not being limited to armed forces filling these behind-the-lines roles.²¹⁷ The fact that cyber operations take ON CYBER CONFLICT, 235, 242 (2012), https://ccdcoe.org/cycon/2012/proceedings/d2r1s10_watts.pdf [https://perma.cc/X6F2-TTRP] [hereinafter Notion of Combatancy].\n²¹¹ Id.\n²¹² See id. at 245 (citing the Project of an International Declaration Concerning the Laws and Customs of War, Aug. 27, 1874, 4 Martens Nouveau Recueil (ser. 2) 219 (“1874 Brussels Declaration”)).\n²¹³ Id.\n²¹⁴ Id.\n²¹⁵ Id.\n²¹⁶ See Notion of Combatancy, supra note 210, at 246.\n²¹⁷ Id.\n\nplace far from the battlefield also bolsters the position of state affiliation, because there is no concern that the enemy will be confused regarding distinction in targeting.²¹⁸ Under the state affiliation view of civilians taking part in cyber operations, discipline in warfare will continue to be preserved as it is under the four Brussels criteria.²¹⁹ Currently, civilians directly participating in hostilities are not subject to the internal military disciplinary system.²²⁰ However, the well-developed legal regimes that prosecute and punish war crimes operate in a manner to vindicate concerns for discipline and humanity.²²¹ In addition to international enforcement bodies, domestic criminal codes now serve as mechanisms where civilians are equally susceptible to prosecution for any war crimes they have committed.²²² Under the state-affiliation view, States will be able to employ civilians to conduct cyber operations while enabling combatant status. States will also be able to maintain the critically important notions of distinction and discipline as provided under the four Brussels criteria.²²³ States employing private contractors and civilian employees do so because of the different landscape and types of operations carried out in cyberspace. As they are written and observed, current LOAC principles, ICRC guidance, and the Tallinn Manual hold that civilians operating in cyberspace in a way that directly participates in hostilities are subject to directly being targeted but are not given combatant immunity. The view of letting state-affiliation drive combatant status determinations for cyberspace operations provides civilians with combatant status, or a version of it, while parties to an armed conflict can still conduct warfare and be no worse off. Currently, parties to an armed conflict operating in cyberspace are left with the difficult task of making determinations regarding direct participation in hostilities by civilians operating anonymously. The state-affiliation view would, at the least, put civilians on notice of what their consequences of participation entail, as well as protect them by [Vol. XLII] giving them some version of combatant immunity for their actions in armed conflict.\nA comparison of state-affiliated actors versus non-state-affiliated actors may lead to different statuses for each. When viewed as either contractors, who are working on behalf of a State engaged in an international armed conflict, or hacktivists, who operate outside of the control of the State but engage in cyber operations in favor of the State, the statuses of each may be seen as divergent.²²⁴ While neither of the two would qualify for combatant immunity, based on the four requirements provided by the Third Geneva Convention,²²⁵ contractors would have the best shot at being entitled prisoner-of-war (“POW”) status.²²⁶ Due to the nature of their service, contractors accompanying an armed force likely carry identification cards associating them with the armed force.²²⁷ Accordingly, contractors would not be given combatant status, but they would be more likely than hacktivists to be given POW status.²²⁸ Civilians accompanying armed forces are afforded some protection, but that protection comes with the inherent danger of accompanying armed forces. State-affiliated civilians qualifying for the narrow category of “civilians accompanying the armed forces” could be eligible for POW status while at the same time also be legitimate military targets for the enemy State.²²⁹ These civilians would likely be performing duties in the functional category of operating and maintaining the cyber operations systems.²³⁰ The civilians filling this state-affiliated role would ²²⁴ See Logan Liles, *The Civilian Cyber Battlefield: Non-State Cyber Operators’ Status Under the Law of Armed Conflict*, 39 N.C.

REG. 1091, 1115 (2014) (explaining contractor’s status under the existing law of armed combat).\n²²⁵ See the Geneva Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, Aug. 12, 1949, 6 U.S.T. 3316, 75 U.N.T.S. 135 (allowing lawful combatancy by requiring the following: (i) command by a person responsible for his subordinates; (ii) wearing distinctive insignia; (iii) carrying arms openly; (iv) conducting operations in accordance with the laws and customs of war).\n²²⁶ Liles, *supra* note 224, at 1116.\n²²⁷ *Id.* ²²⁸ *Id.* ²²⁹ See Turns, *supra* note 62 (citing National Research Council Report on one of the most difficult aspects to handle of a cyberattack).\n²³⁰ See *id.* at 290 (citing a report published by the U.S. National Research Council, which suggested that “the systems used to launch cyberattacks are legitimate military targets, and civilians who qualify for the narrow category of ‘civilians accompanying the understand the potential for harm or even death, based on their role and proximate geographic location to armed forces.²³¹ Their role and location make them possible military targets as well as collateral damage for the enemy State attacking the armed force.\nAnother area of civilian participation in the cyber domain, which remains unresolved, is the participation by civilian scientists specializing in cyberspace. The majority of the participation by a state-affiliated civilian cyber scientist would be viewed as indirect participation.²³² However, there are possible situations where a civilian’s particular expertise could have an exceptional and potentially decisive value for the outcome of an armed conflict.²³³ An example would be a computer programmer who researches and writes attack programs, one of which is used to incapacitate the enemy’s network controlling the launch of weapons systems.²³⁴ In this example, the civilian scientist could be responsible for the turning point in the conflict, thus shifting his participation from indirect to direct.²³⁵ The importance of this example is that the State hosting the state-affiliated civilian and the civilian need to understand the possible implications of having the scientist participate, directly or indirectly, in hostilities. Further, the enemy State is going to have to make a call as to whether it can directly target the civilian scientist or attack the military target and consider the scientist collateral damage.\n## B. Non-State-Affiliated Civilians Non-state-affiliated civilians, also known as patriotic hackers or hacktivists, are the civilians directly participating in hostilities armed forces’ (presumably those who operate and maintain those systems)—even if they do not actually press the button that launches a cyberattack—are both eligible for prisoner-of-war status and also legitimate military targets for the enemy”).\n²³¹ *Id.* ²³² *See id.* at 291–92 (stating that “there is a high probability that many, if not most, of the personnel substantively involved in cyber operations may actually be civilians”).\n²³³ *See id.* at 292 (discussing that “[c]omputer technicians, technical maintenance personnel and others who perform similar tasks... could thus qualify for inclusion in the limited category of ‘persons who accompany the armed forces without actually being members thereof’”).\n²³⁴ *See id.* at 291 (distinguishing computer programmers who research and write attack programs from operators who execute cyber attacks).\n²³⁵ Turns, *supra* note 62, at 291.\n\n[Vol. XLII] on their own volition, so they will likely receive no protection under LOAC. These hackers carry out cyber operations against perceived enemy computer systems, without the control or oversight from their government but seek common political ends.²³⁶ Hacktivists would seem to receive no protection due to their direct participation in hostilities; however, hacktivists could arguably be considered participants in a *levée en masse* if they took up arms spontaneously upon the enemy approaching, lack organization, and carried arms openly.²³⁷ If so, hacktivists would be entitled to POW status, but they could be directly targeted while directly participating in hostilities.²³⁸ The LOAC principles have not been updated for cyber operations, so it is difficult to play out exactly how non-state-affiliated civilians are to be treated during international armed conflicts. Ideally, IHL would be universally understood by states engaged in armed conflict and the non-state-affiliated civilians who choose to directly participate in cyber hostilities would be on notice as to how their actions will be measured.\nAlso, made difficult by the landscape and types of operations carried out in cyberspace is the direct targeting of those individuals directly participating. Aside from anonymity being a difficult hurdle in cyberspace, the determination as to whether a physical attack is justified in response to a cyber action is still theoretical. Furthermore, neither treaties nor customary international law have established the illegality of espionage, either in the physical world or in cyberspace. Thus, civilians conducting CNAs on behalf of a State which is party to an armed conflict may not be directly participating in hostilities. Further, customary international law has not recognized data manipulation and deletions as rising to the level of hostilities, so civilians conducting these types of CNAs would not be directly participating in hostilities.\n## VI. Suggested Treatment For Non-State-Affiliated Civilians ²³⁶ *Id.* at 293.\n²³⁷ *See id.* (explaining that hacktivists could arguably be assimilated to the rarely used category of *levée en masse*, in which case they would be entitled to POW status if captured, and could also be subject to attack while acting as such a body; [i]n order to meet the legal conditions of a *levée en masse* they would have to “take up arms” spontaneously “on the approach of the enemy”).\n²³⁸ *See id.* (explaining the difficulty of applying the criteria necessary to meet the legal conditions of a *levée en masse* in a cyber-conflict).\n\n# Directly Participating In Cyber Hostilities\nThe principles of LOAC, as they currently exist, govern actions taken in cyberspace as if they occur in the more traditional, physical domain. A major concern with this LOAC application is the effect it has on civilians. As the law of war has evolved, the protection of civilians has been one of the key tenets from the outset. The Fourth Geneva Convention sought to protect civilian persons taking no part in hostilities as well as the wounded and sick.²³⁹ The Convention also prohibited an occupying power from destroying real and personal property belonging to civilians.²⁴⁰ The Additional Protocol I of the Geneva Convention calls for the protection of civilians from unnecessary injury or death and obliges combatants to distinguish themselves from the civilian population while engaged in an attack.²⁴¹ The civilian population is specifically protected under Part IV, which demands the parties to at all times distinguish between civilian population and combatants as well as between civilian objects and military objectives.²⁴² Further, Protocol I prohibits parties from making the civilian population the object of an attack, which also prohibits acts or threats having the intent to terrorize the civilian population.²⁴³\nThe protections provided by LOAC are two-fold. On one hand, they are meant to inform parties to an armed conflict regarding how to conduct themselves while at war. On the other hand, LOAC provides notice to civilians affected by armed conflict as to the treatment they can expect from the parties to the conflict. The relative nuance of cyberspace operations, as compared to traditional warfare, makes difficult the determination of direct participation in hostilities by citizens. If LOAC principles are incapable of adequately putting parties to armed conflict and citizens on notice, it should be amended for this purpose.\n²³⁹ Geneva Convention, supra note 2, art. 15.\n²⁴⁰ Id.\n²⁴¹ Id. art. 44.\n²⁴² Protocol I, supra note 1, art. 48.\n²⁴³ Id. art. 51.\n\n[Vol. XLII ## A. Temporal Considerations in the Cyber Domain Direct participation in hostilities by civilians operating in the cyber domain is vastly different than participation in the physical domain due to temporal considerations. Actions taken in cyberspace are not easily detected as they are happening, and they are often created for use in the future. For example, computer network attacks involve the use of malicious code to either infect an enemy’s computer system or to exploit weaknesses in the software, system configuration, or security practices.²⁴⁴ Additionally, bots and even botnets are remotely-controlled or semi-autonomous computer programs that infect computers and systems to transmit data obtained by the system or instruct the system to operate a certain way.²⁴⁵ Hackers have even designed ways to exploit computers and systems in a way to launch programs anonymously and autonomously from thousands of infected computers.²⁴⁶ Accordingly, cyber operations differ greatly from physical operations due to the timing of how the operations are carried out. Cyber operations can be set to take place at a certain time in the future or after a certain event has occurred.\nThe ICRC Guidance and the Tallinn Manual both touch on these temporal considerations. The ICRC provides that preparatory acts can be treated as separate acts and distinguished from the act that is the object of the direct participation in hostilities.²⁴⁷ Therefore, a civilian participating in hostilities may ²⁴⁴ See WILSON, supra note 163, at 39 (explaining the characteristics of malicious code).\n²⁴⁵ Id. at 38 (explaining that “[a]utomated programs, or ‘bots’... are increasingly autonomous, rapid, and difficult to detect... [and] can be remotely controlled by commands sent through the Internet and can be activated to operate in a coordinated manner on thousands of computers in different locations around the world”); see id. at 41 (explaining that “[s]ome compromised computers become part of an automatic ‘bot network,’ quietly performing espionage by transmitting data or intermediate preparatory instructions back and forth between compromised computers while awaiting a special final activation signal originating from the attacker”).\n²⁴⁶ See id. at 43 (explaining that “hackers have also designed recent computer exploits that launch anonymously from thousands of infected computers to produce waves of disruption that can quickly overwhelm a targeted organization, or multiple organizations such as a list of banking institutions”).\n²⁴⁷ See Melzer, supra note 90, at 68 (stating that “[w]here the execution of a hostile act does not require geographic displacement, as may be the case with computer network attacks or remote-controlled weapons systems, the duration of direct participation in conduct a series of acts, each directly participating in hostilities, over a period of time that lead up to the object of the direct participation. The Tallinn Manual provides that the scope of direct participation includes the actions immediately preceding and those subsequent to the qualifying act of direct participation in hostilities.²⁴⁸ The majority of the Tallinn Experts agree that a civilian is directly targetable only for the duration of the direct participation in hostilities, regardless of when the actual effects are realized.²⁴⁹ Yet, some of the experts take the position that the time period during which a civilian can be directly targeted extends for as long as there is a causal link to the intended harm.²⁵⁰ That is, a civilian is targetable as far upstream and as far downstream as that civilian’s causal link exists between the action taken and the intended harm.²⁵¹ As an example, a civilian may be targeted as early as when he begins a cyber operation by probing the enemy’s system and carry through to when he conducts the cyber operation against the system.²⁵² The civilian may even be targeted after the cyber operation, when he is conducting a damage assessment and determining whether to conduct another operation against the system.²⁵³ These temporal considerations are worth exploring because they mostly exist only in the cyber context. Accordingly, there may be a disconnect between how States view cyber operations versus operations in the physical world due to the way LOAC principles were developed for the physical world. Though it is possible to parallel these temporal considerations by discussing IEDs emplaced for the destruction of the enemy State’s equipment and the injury of its people, there is not a precise match. While IEDs can be emplaced with the intent of them going off in the future upon being activated, IEDs with this setup cannot be controlled and changed like their logic bomb counterpart in the cyber world. Applying LOAC principles to an IED would yield ²⁴⁸ TALLINN MANUAL, *supra* note 52, at Rule 35, comment 7.\n²⁴⁹ *Id.* at Rule 35, comment 8.\n²⁵⁰ *Id.* at Rule 35, comment 7.\n²⁵¹ *Id.* ²⁵² *Id.* ²⁵³ *Id.* [Vol. XLII the bomb maker likely being targetable while building the bomb, based on his intent, and the civilian emplacing the IED being targetable while emplacing the IED. It would not be as clean cut in the cyber world based on the ability of the logic bomb builder and the one who activates it to carry out the entire operation in complete anonymity as well as being able to control the logic bomb once it is emplaced.\nFor the sake of clarifying the discussion below, the civilians being discussed are non-state-affiliated civilians. State-affiliated civilians are those who operate as either private contractors on behalf of the State or as civilian employees, who are employed by the State. These civilians are better aware of their exposure to direct attack based on the nature of their service, which could include operational as well as geographic proximity to armed forces. Thus, the State and the state-affiliated civilians are on notice as to whether and for how long the civilians may be directly targeted by the opposing state during an armed conflict.\nAdditional Protocol I provides that civilians and civilian populations enjoy general protection against dangers arising from military operations.²⁵⁴ However, civilians forfeit this protection if and for so long as they directly participate in hostilities.²⁵⁵ Direct participation by civilians in cyberspace is not always clear. The International Group of Experts was split regarding repeated cyber operations by civilians that qualified as direct participation in hostilities.²⁵⁶ Some of the experts side with ICRC guidance, which provides that each act must be treated separately as separate acts of direct participation.²⁵⁷ Other experts conclude separate direct participation analysis made little operational sense and believe it would create a “revolving door” effect regarding targetability.²⁵⁸ This group of experts believes direct participation by the civilian begins with the first cyber operation he participates in and continues throughout the period of intermittent activity.²⁵⁹ This incongruent application of existing LOAC principles on cyberspace operations demonstrates the potential for civilians and ²⁵⁴ Protocol I, supra note 1, art. 51.\n²⁵⁵ Id.\n²⁵⁶ TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 52, Rule 35, comment 7.\n²⁵⁷ Id.\n²⁵⁸ Id.\n²⁵⁹ Id.\n\nparties to an armed conflict to misapply or misinterpret LOAC principles.\nWhat if a non-state-affiliated civilian were to create an autonomous logic bomb and release it with the intent to infiltrate and attack the computer network of the defense ministry of a State which is party to an ongoing armed conflict? At what point could the civilian be targeted by the State? If the State discovers the logic bomb months after it was released by the civilian, and assuming the State can attribute it to the civilian, can the State target the civilian then? Under ICRC guidance, the civilian could be directly targeted for each act of direct participation in hostilities.²⁶⁰ Accordingly, the civilian could be directly attacked when producing the logic bomb with the intent to launch a CNA against the State, if done so in support of another party to the conflict, and when the civilian actually launches the logic bomb.²⁶¹ However, ICRC guidance would not likely support a direct attack against the civilian if discovered months after it was launched. Under the Tallinn Manual’s viewpoint, the civilian may be directly targeted.²⁶² As discussed above, it may be unclear to civilians directly participating in hostilities in the cyber domain as to how their actions could be interpreted by parties to an armed conflict. Aside from civilians conducting intermittent direct participation in hostilities in cyberspace, civilians may also be unclear as to their exposure for direct targeting due to the uncertain application of LOAC principles to the cyber domain. Specifically, civilians launching autonomous or semi-autonomous programs to attack computer networks may directly participate in hostilities by building the code and program for the specific purpose as well as directly participate by launching the CNA.²⁶³ However, these civilians may at some point decide they no longer wish to pursue the action against a party to an armed conflict.\n²⁶⁰ JEAN-MARIE HENCKAERTS &amp; LOUISE DOSWALD-BECK, CUSTOMARY INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW VOL. 1: RULES 1, 21 (2005).\n²⁶¹ Id.\n²⁶² Id. at 23.\n²⁶³ Turns, supra note 62, at 281.\n\n[Vol. XLII ## B. Change of Heart for Civilians Directly Participating in Cyber Hostilities How might a civilian make clear to a State embroiled in an armed conflict that the civilian who conducted a cyber operation against the State no longer wishes to directly participate in cyber hostilities? In the physical domain, the civilian would simply stop shooting at the party, collecting arms to use against the party, building bombs to emplace in roadways, or collecting money to finance attacks against the party to the conflict.²⁶⁴ An example which could parallel the cyber domain would be a civilian bomb maker who makes a bomb and emplaces that bomb in a road in an effort to target a party to an armed conflict. However, the bomb maker could make clear his intentions to no longer directly participate by putting up a sign warning of the bomb, digging up the bomb, or telling the party the location of the bomb. In cyberspace, a civilian who creates the malicious code for the CNA and launches it may not be able to recall the code or stop the cyber operation once it has begun.²⁶⁵ Once the malicious code is discovered, the targeted State may attack the civilian because it is impossible to precisely determine if the civilian has stopped directly participating in cyber hostilities. The State could argue the civilian is still monitoring and directing the logic bomb or malicious code.\nThe advanced technology which enables civilians to directly participate in hostilities could make it difficult for both the civilian and the party to the armed conflict to know when the civilian is no longer directly participating.²⁶⁶ The civilian who produces the malicious code for a CNA concludes his direct participation when he stops working on or even finishes the code. Would the civilian who launches the malicious code for a CNA conclude his direct participation when the code is launched? What if the malicious code were autonomous or semi-autonomous, and it would continue to operate without the aid from the civilian? This would seem to be a magic bullet fired in the physical world. In the physical domain, the bullet would lose speed and fall to the earth. However, malicious code launched in the cyber domain may ²⁶⁴ *Id.* ²⁶⁵ *Id.* ²⁶⁶ *Id.* continue until it is discovered and counter by the attacked party or until it reaches its termination stage, if it has one. May the civilian launching this code be directly targeted until the malicious code ceases to operate as part of the CNA?\nCurrent interpretations by the ICRC and the International Group of Experts contributing to the Tallinn Manual apply IHL to the cyber domain and determine that the civilian launching the CNA code can only be targeted so long as he is directly participating in hostilities, which is when he is actively engaged.²⁶⁷ The ICRC and the Group of Experts are unwilling to extend the window of targetability to include ongoing hostilities set in motion by the individual unleashing the malicious code aimed at conducting a CNA.²⁶⁸ As previously stated in the magic bullet analogy, there is nothing to stop the CNA code except for the initiator, unless the attacked State becomes aware of the CNA and takes steps to defend against it. Accordingly, should not the attacked State be able to target the civilian initiator after he has set in motion the CNA? If the State is able to stretch the targetability window to legally target the initiating civilian so long as the CNA is underway, can the civilian limit his exposure in any way?\nA solution might be found in the American Law Institute’s Model Penal Code (“MPC”). The MPC defines criminal conspiracy as a person conspiring with another person or group of persons to commit a crime if the individual, with the purpose of promoting or facilitating the crime: 1) agrees with the other person or group that one or more of them will engage in conduct constituting a crime; or 2) agrees to aid the other person or group in planning or committing the crime.²⁶⁹ However, the actor may, after having conspired to commit a crime, use as an affirmative defense the fact that the actor thwarted the success of the conspiracy after having manifested a complete and voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.²⁷⁰ By renouncing his support for the crime and thwarting the success of the conspiracy, the actor is able to undo the effort he put into conspiring to commit the crime.\n²⁶⁷ Eva Knopova, *New IHL Framework for Cyber Warfare: Master’s Thesis*, CHARLES UNIV. PRAGUE DEP’T INT’L L. 47 (2016).\n²⁶⁸ Id.\n²⁶⁹ American Law Institute, *MODEL PENAL CODE § 5.03* (Tent. Draft No. 4, 1955).\n²⁷⁰ Id.\n\n[Vol. XLII] As applied to the above issue regarding civilians directly participating in cyber hostilities, a civilian putting into place malicious code capable of autonomously conducting a CNA may be able to be certain he cannot be directly targeted by the party to an armed conflict by renouncing his support for the cyber hostilities and working to thwart further cyber hostilities by the code.²⁷¹ By attempting to prevent future direct targeting, the civilian may inadvertently leave himself exposed to attack by making his actions and identity known to the party. However, a party to an armed conflict abiding by LOAC would not be able to target a civilian who is no longer participating in hostilities.²⁷² Further, the civilian may take similar actions to renounce his participation and thwart further action by the code in an anonymous way.\nBy adopting this view, States who are a party to an armed conflict have better ground rules as to how to legally target non-state-affiliated civilians who are participating in cyber hostilities in a way that may not be covered by current IHL.²⁷³ Additionally, under this view, civilians will have a better understanding of how their actions, carried out as cyber operations, will be treated by States who are a party to an armed conflict. This view provides States and civilians with notice of how actions by civilians will be treated in cyberspace. Further, this view provides civilians who have participated in cyber hostilities, and who may be determined to be still participating based on the autonomous CNA code the individual initiated, an opportunity to remove themselves from hostilities. By taking steps discussed in the MPC to remove oneself from a conspiracy, the initiating individual can undo the bonds currently opening himself up to being targeted by a party to the conflict.²⁷⁴ By coming forward, renouncing his support for the ongoing cyber hostilities, and attempting to thwart the object of the cyber ²⁷¹ HENCKAERTS &amp; DOSWALD-BECK, supra note 260, at 19–20.\n²⁷² See generally INT’L &amp; OPERATIONAL L. DEP’T., THE JUDGE ADVOCATE GEN.’S LEGAL CTR. &amp; SCH., U.S. ARMY, LAW OF ARMED CONFLICT DESKBOOK, 7 (2015) (explaining that “[o]nly combatants or those directly participating in hostilities may be targeted... [n]on-combatants, including civilians and persons out of combat, may not intentionally be targeted”).\n²⁷³ HENCKAERTS &amp; DOSWALD-BECK, supra note 260, at 19–20.\n²⁷⁴ American Law Institute, supra note 269.\n\noperation, a civilian may prevent the targeted State from directly targeting the civilian.²⁷⁵ However, the civilian may also be creating an unexpected repercussion. The civilian directly taking part in cyber hostilities, favoring a party to an armed conflict by conducting cyber operations against an opponent party, also exposes himself to domestic criminal law pertaining to the cyber operations. By coming forward, the civilian may be opening himself up to prosecution under domestic criminal law in an effort to prevent being directly targeted by the State against whom the civilian directly participated in hostilities.²⁷⁶ This may create a disincentive for civilians to expose themselves as ongoing direct participants in cyber hostilities, but the damage is already done.\nThe only question that remains is attribution. Can the attacked State determine who the civilian is for either direct targeting purposes or domestic criminal prosecution? If the civilian believes so, the civilian could limit his exposure to being directly attacked as well as request leniency from the domestic criminal prosecution for his cooperation.²⁷⁷ The alternative is for the civilian to figure out a way to completely remove every trace of his participation in an ongoing cyber operation, thereby ensuring the attacked State does not discover the cyber operation, attribute it to the civilian, and directly attack him.²⁷⁸ Without this possible outlet, civilians who have had a change of heart and no longer wish to participate in cyber hostilities may be targeted in the future for previous participation in cyber hostilities, of which they no longer wish to be a part. Though not a perfect method for keeping civilians safe from being directly targeted, this method provides notice to the attacking State of the civilian’s previous acts, which are the acts the civilian no longer wishes to be held accountable for in the realm of armed conflict. The civilian’s renouncing of previous participation in hostilities will not absolve him of domestic law implications, but it will ensure he is not targeted in the future.²⁷⁹ [Vol. XLII] # VII. Conclusion Civilians directly participate in hostilities for numerous reasons. State-affiliated civilians might engage in direct participation as part of their job; non-state-affiliated civilians might directly participate out of a sense of patriotism, helping the underdog, or feeling like part of the fight. Cyberspace creates an environment unlike any other ever seen before, so civilians and States who are a party to an armed conflict struggle to understand how LOAC principles apply to their conduct. A misunderstanding by a civilian could lead to a prolonged period of being directly targeted by a party to a conflict; a misunderstanding by that party could lead to allegations of war crimes. All sides to a conflict, to include civilians, would benefit from consensus in the application of LOAC to the cyber domain.\nA consensus in the application of LOAC principles in the cyber domain could lead to stronger footing for States and citizens as the cyberspace domain becomes a larger battleground. Cyberspace issues such as anonymity, attribution, temporal considerations, and equal application of force between the physical and cyber domains all highlight the need to better define LOAC applications to the cyber domain.²⁸⁰ Specifically, civilians should be able to renounce their direct participation in cyber hostilities, and they should no longer face direct targeting by a party to a conflict for cyber operations taken previously. The Tallinn Manual spells out that civilians may be directly targeted so long as their causal link to the action exists.²⁸¹ States subscribing to this view may link civilians to cyber operations carried out previously, even after civilians have walked away and no longer desire to directly participate.\nThe ability to target civilians for previous acts of cyber hostilities when States believe a causal link still exists may lead to an expanded window of time during which a civilian may be targeted. Thus, States who are party to a conflict should be able to know with certainty that the civilian they intend to target is a lawful target, due to the civilian’s ongoing intent to directly participate in hostilities. The renunciation clause found in the Model Penal Code could be the solution to ending ²⁸⁰ Turns, supra note 62, at 281.\n²⁸¹ Id.\n\nmisunderstandings by civilians and parties to a conflict regarding direct participation and targeting.²⁸² Under this view, civilians have a way to guarantee they will no longer be directly targeted for past cyber operations amounting to direct participation in hostilities when the State may not know the civilian’s participation has concluded. In addition, this view provides an out for States directly targeting civilians for directly participating in cyber hostilities against the State because the civilian has the opportunity and incentive to come clean if the civilian no longer wishes to directly participate. By coming forward, civilians may open themselves up to domestic prosecution, but they guarantee they will not be directly targeted by a State.\nA final point is examined by asking: should civilians have to go to such lengths to ensure they will not be directly targeted by a State for previous instances of direct participation in hostilities? Further, should LOAC require citizens to take active steps to put States on notice as to the citizens’ activities to prevent being illegally targeted after the direct participation in hostilities has concluded? An argument can be made that this policy would be requiring too much of civilians, and it exposes civilians to a lose-lose scenario.\nOn the one hand, civilians want to ensure the temporal anomalies in the cyber domain do not mislead States into falsely believing civilians are continuing to directly participate in hostilities after participation has ended. On the other, civilians want to protect against domestic prosecution and initiating an investigation into their activities. Though a possible solution to the issue of civilians being overly or illegally targeted could be found in the Model Penal Code, international law may not be willing to support the process or potential side effects to civilians providing notice to States that the civilians have withdrawn from the direct participation in hostilities.\n\n^{}[]"

Tucker Jr., USAF [B.A., Valdosta State University (2002); M.B.A., [Vol. XLII # I. Introduction The Law of Armed Conflict (“LOAC”) has evolved over the past century and a half to protect civilians from the harms caused by war as well as to put all parties on notice as to their expected conduct. Civilians, like any other group, are not prohibited from directly participating in hostilities, but they lose their protection from being directly targeted for such time as they chose to do so.¹ This protection for civilians is easier understood as it is applied to the physical domain, for which it was created. The cyber domain is vastly different. Accordingly, civilians and States who are party to international armed conflicts are left to apply their own understanding of how LOAC principles should be applied to the cyber domain.\nThe difference of interpretation by civilians and parties to armed conflict could leave civilians overly exposed to direct attack and parties accountable for war crimes. This is especially true for non-state-affiliated civilians conducting cyber hostilities against a State that is party to an armed conflict. The differentiation between state-affiliated and non-state-affiliated civilians matters, because state-affiliated civilians should understand they may be injured or killed based on their work alongside and their proximity to armed forces. Thus, they are likely on notice that they may be directly targeted if directly participating in hostilities as well as considered collateral damage during a legal attack by an enemy State. In addition, civilians may open themselves up to an extended period of time during which they may be directly targeted based on the type of cyber operation they conduct.\nVarying views support the notion that civilians intermittently participating directly in hostilities may be targeted throughout a linked-together period of participation. Further, if a civilian were to launch against a State a cyber operation that activates at a set point in the future or after a forecasted event, the State could possibly treat the civilian as directly participating in hostilities long after the civilian actually initiated and participated in the cyber operation. This delayed direct targeting of the civilian can happen either because the State is unaware of exactly when the cyber operation was launched against it or because it interprets its ¹ Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts, June 8, 1977, 110 Stat. 2104, 1125 U.N.T.S. 51 [hereinafter Protocol I].\nresponse as warranted under LOAC.\nAlong with opening themselves up to being directly targeted, civilians participating in cyber hostilities may also face domestic criminal law exposure for their cyber hostilities. States that are party to an armed conflict could seek to lawfully target the civilian rather than await a domestic law prosecution. A possible solution to civilians being overly exposed to direct attack for their decision to directly participate in cyber hostilities could come from the Model Penal Code’s view of renouncing one’s role and thwarting the overall success of the act. Under this theory, a civilian could make the enemy State aware of the civilian’s plot to conduct an ongoing cyber operation against the State in an effort to absolve the civilian of being targeted in the future. However, these civilians may still face domestic criminal law repercussions for doing so.\n\n---\n\n## ## VI. Suggested Treatment For Non-State-Affiliated Civilians ²³⁶ *Id.* at 293.\n\n²³⁷ *See id.* (explaining that hacktivists could arguably be assimilated to the rarely used category of *levée en masse*, in which case they would be entitled to POW status if captured, and could also be subject to attack while acting as such a body; [i]n order to meet the legal conditions of a *levée en masse* they would have to “take up arms” spontaneously “on the approach of the enemy”).\n²³⁸ *See id.* (explaining the difficulty of applying the criteria necessary to meet the legal conditions of a *levée en masse* in a cyber-conflict).\nThe principles of LOAC, as they currently exist, govern actions taken in cyberspace as if they occur in the more traditional, physical domain. A major concern with this LOAC application is the effect it has on civilians. As the law of war has evolved, the protection of civilians has been one of the key tenets from the outset. The Fourth Geneva Convention sought to protect civilian persons taking no part in hostilities as well as the wounded and sick.²³⁹ The Convention also prohibited an occupying power from destroying real and personal property belonging to civilians.²⁴⁰ The Additional Protocol I of the Geneva Convention calls for the protection of civilians from unnecessary injury or death and obliges combatants to distinguish themselves from the civilian population while engaged in an attack.²⁴¹ The civilian population is specifically protected under Part IV, which demands the parties to at all times distinguish between civilian population and combatants as well as between civilian objects and military objectives.²⁴² Further, Protocol I prohibits parties from making the civilian population the object of an attack, which also prohibits acts or threats having the intent to terrorize the civilian population.²⁴³\nThe protections provided by LOAC are two-fold. On one hand, they are meant to inform parties to an armed conflict regarding how to conduct themselves while at war. On the other hand, LOAC provides notice to civilians affected by armed conflict as to the treatment they can expect from the parties to the conflict. The relative nuance of cyberspace operations, as compared to traditional warfare, makes difficult the determination of direct participation in hostilities by citizens. If LOAC principles are incapable of adequately putting parties to armed conflict and citizens on notice, it should be amended for this purpose.\n²³⁹ Geneva Convention, supra note 2, art. 15.\n²⁴⁰ Id.\n²⁴¹ Id. art. 44.\n²⁴² Protocol I, supra note 1, art. 48.\n²⁴³ Id. art. 51.\n[Vol. XLII ## A. Temporal Considerations in the Cyber Domain Direct participation in hostilities by civilians operating in the cyber domain is vastly different than participation in the physical domain due to temporal considerations. Actions taken in cyberspace are not easily detected as they are happening, and they are often created for use in the future. For example, computer network attacks involve the use of malicious code to either infect an enemy’s computer system or to exploit weaknesses in the software, system configuration, or security practices.²⁴⁴ Additionally, bots and even botnets are remotely-controlled or semi-autonomous computer programs that infect computers and systems to transmit data obtained by the system or instruct the system to operate a certain way.²⁴⁵ Hackers have even designed ways to exploit computers and systems in a way to launch programs anonymously and autonomously from thousands of infected computers.²⁴⁶ Accordingly, cyber operations differ greatly from physical operations due to the timing of how the operations are carried out. Cyber operations can be set to take place at a certain time in the future or after a certain event has occurred.\nThe ICRC Guidance and the Tallinn Manual both touch on these temporal considerations. The ICRC provides that preparatory acts can be treated as separate acts and distinguished from the act that is the object of the direct participation in hostilities.²⁴⁷ Therefore, a civilian participating in hostilities may ²⁴⁴ See WILSON, supra note 163, at 39 (explaining the characteristics of malicious code).\n²⁴⁵ Id. at 38 (explaining that “[a]utomated programs, or ‘bots’... are increasingly autonomous, rapid, and difficult to detect... [and] can be remotely controlled by commands sent through the Internet and can be activated to operate in a coordinated manner on thousands of computers in different locations around the world”); see id. at 41 (explaining that “[s]ome compromised computers become part of an automatic ‘bot network,’ quietly performing espionage by transmitting data or intermediate preparatory instructions back and forth between compromised computers while awaiting a special final activation signal originating from the attacker”).\n²⁴⁶ See id. at 43 (explaining that “hackers have also designed recent computer exploits that launch anonymously from thousands of infected computers to produce waves of disruption that can quickly overwhelm a targeted organization, or multiple organizations such as a list of banking institutions”).\n²⁴⁷ See Melzer, supra note 90, at 68 (stating that “[w]here the execution of a hostile act does not require geographic displacement, as may be the case with computer network attacks or remote-controlled weapons systems, the duration of direct participation in conduct a series of acts, each directly participating in hostilities, over a period of time that lead up to the object of the direct participation. The Tallinn Manual provides that the scope of direct participation includes the actions immediately preceding and those subsequent to the qualifying act of direct participation in hostilities.²⁴⁸ The majority of the Tallinn Experts agree that a civilian is directly targetable only for the duration of the direct participation in hostilities, regardless of when the actual effects are realized.²⁴⁹ Yet, some of the experts take the position that the time period during which a civilian can be directly targeted extends for as long as there is a causal link to the intended harm.²⁵⁰ That is, a civilian is targetable as far upstream and as far downstream as that civilian’s causal link exists between the action taken and the intended harm.²⁵¹ As an example, a civilian may be targeted as early as when he begins a cyber operation by probing the enemy’s system and carry through to when he conducts the cyber operation against the system.²⁵² The civilian may even be targeted after the cyber operation, when he is conducting a damage assessment and determining whether to conduct another operation against the system.²⁵³ These temporal considerations are worth exploring because they mostly exist only in the cyber context. Accordingly, there may be a disconnect between how States view cyber operations versus operations in the physical world due to the way LOAC principles were developed for the physical world. Though it is possible to parallel these temporal considerations by discussing IEDs emplaced for the destruction of the enemy State’s equipment and the injury of its people, there is not a precise match. While IEDs can be emplaced with the intent of them going off in the future upon being activated, IEDs with this setup cannot be controlled and changed like their logic bomb counterpart in the cyber world. Applying LOAC principles to an IED would yield ²⁴⁸ TALLINN MANUAL, *supra* note 52, at Rule 35, comment 7.\n²⁴⁹ *Id.* at Rule 35, comment 8.\n²⁵⁰ *Id.* at Rule 35, comment 7.\n²⁵¹ *Id.* ²⁵² *Id.* ²⁵³ *Id.* [Vol. XLII the bomb maker likely being targetable while building the bomb, based on his intent, and the civilian emplacing the IED being targetable while emplacing the IED. It would not be as clean cut in the cyber world based on the ability of the logic bomb builder and the one who activates it to carry out the entire operation in complete anonymity as well as being able to control the logic bomb once it is emplaced.\nFor the sake of clarifying the discussion below, the civilians being discussed are non-state-affiliated civilians. State-affiliated civilians are those who operate as either private contractors on behalf of the State or as civilian employees, who are employed by the State. These civilians are better aware of their exposure to direct attack based on the nature of their service, which could include operational as well as geographic proximity to armed forces. Thus, the State and the state-affiliated civilians are on notice as to whether and for how long the civilians may be directly targeted by the opposing state during an armed conflict.\nAdditional Protocol I provides that civilians and civilian populations enjoy general protection against dangers arising from military operations.²⁵⁴ However, civilians forfeit this protection if and for so long as they directly participate in hostilities.²⁵⁵ Direct participation by civilians in cyberspace is not always clear. The International Group of Experts was split regarding repeated cyber operations by civilians that qualified as direct participation in hostilities.²⁵⁶ Some of the experts side with ICRC guidance, which provides that each act must be treated separately as separate acts of direct participation.²⁵⁷ Other experts conclude separate direct participation analysis made little operational sense and believe it would create a “revolving door” effect regarding targetability.²⁵⁸ This group of experts believes direct participation by the civilian begins with the first cyber operation he participates in and continues throughout the period of intermittent activity.²⁵⁹ This incongruent application of existing LOAC principles on cyberspace operations demonstrates the potential for civilians and ²⁵⁴ Protocol I, supra note 1, art. 51.\n²⁵⁵ Id.\n²⁵⁶ TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 52, Rule 35, comment 7.\n²⁵⁷ Id.\n²⁵⁸ Id.\n²⁵⁹ Id.\nparties to an armed conflict to misapply or misinterpret LOAC principles.\nWhat if a non-state-affiliated civilian were to create an autonomous logic bomb and release it with the intent to infiltrate and attack the computer network of the defense ministry of a State which is party to an ongoing armed conflict? At what point could the civilian be targeted by the State? If the State discovers the logic bomb months after it was released by the civilian, and assuming the State can attribute it to the civilian, can the State target the civilian then? Under ICRC guidance, the civilian could be directly targeted for each act of direct participation in hostilities.²⁶⁰ Accordingly, the civilian could be directly attacked when producing the logic bomb with the intent to launch a CNA against the State, if done so in support of another party to the conflict, and when the civilian actually launches the logic bomb.²⁶¹ However, ICRC guidance would not likely support a direct attack against the civilian if discovered months after it was launched. Under the Tallinn Manual’s viewpoint, the civilian may be directly targeted.²⁶² As discussed above, it may be unclear to civilians directly participating in hostilities in the cyber domain as to how their actions could be interpreted by parties to an armed conflict. Aside from civilians conducting intermittent direct participation in hostilities in cyberspace, civilians may also be unclear as to their exposure for direct targeting due to the uncertain application of LOAC principles to the cyber domain. Specifically, civilians launching autonomous or semi-autonomous programs to attack computer networks may directly participate in hostilities by building the code and program for the specific purpose as well as directly participate by launching the CNA.²⁶³ However, these civilians may at some point decide they no longer wish to pursue the action against a party to an armed conflict.\n²⁶⁰ JEAN-MARIE HENCKAERTS &amp; LOUISE DOSWALD-BECK, CUSTOMARY INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW VOL. 1: RULES 1, 21 (2005).\n²⁶¹ Id.\n²⁶² Id. at 23.\n²⁶³ Turns, supra note 62, at 281.\n[Vol. XLII ## B. Change of Heart for Civilians Directly Participating in Cyber Hostilities How might a civilian make clear to a State embroiled in an armed conflict that the civilian who conducted a cyber operation against the State no longer wishes to directly participate in cyber hostilities? In the physical domain, the civilian would simply stop shooting at the party, collecting arms to use against the party, building bombs to emplace in roadways, or collecting money to finance attacks against the party to the conflict.²⁶⁴ An example which could parallel the cyber domain would be a civilian bomb maker who makes a bomb and emplaces that bomb in a road in an effort to target a party to an armed conflict. However, the bomb maker could make clear his intentions to no longer directly participate by putting up a sign warning of the bomb, digging up the bomb, or telling the party the location of the bomb. In cyberspace, a civilian who creates the malicious code for the CNA and launches it may not be able to recall the code or stop the cyber operation once it has begun.²⁶⁵ Once the malicious code is discovered, the targeted State may attack the civilian because it is impossible to precisely determine if the civilian has stopped directly participating in cyber hostilities. The State could argue the civilian is still monitoring and directing the logic bomb or malicious code.\nThe advanced technology which enables civilians to directly participate in hostilities could make it difficult for both the civilian and the party to the armed conflict to know when the civilian is no longer directly participating.²⁶⁶ The civilian who produces the malicious code for a CNA concludes his direct participation when he stops working on or even finishes the code. Would the civilian who launches the malicious code for a CNA conclude his direct participation when the code is launched? What if the malicious code were autonomous or semi-autonomous, and it would continue to operate without the aid from the civilian? This would seem to be a magic bullet fired in the physical world. In the physical domain, the bullet would lose speed and fall to the earth. However, malicious code launched in the cyber domain may ²⁶⁴ *Id.* ²⁶⁵ *Id.* ²⁶⁶ *Id.* continue until it is discovered and counter by the attacked party or until it reaches its termination stage, if it has one. May the civilian launching this code be directly targeted until the malicious code ceases to operate as part of the CNA?\nCurrent interpretations by the ICRC and the International Group of Experts contributing to the Tallinn Manual apply IHL to the cyber domain and determine that the civilian launching the CNA code can only be targeted so long as he is directly participating in hostilities, which is when he is actively engaged.²⁶⁷ The ICRC and the Group of Experts are unwilling to extend the window of targetability to include ongoing hostilities set in motion by the individual unleashing the malicious code aimed at conducting a CNA.²⁶⁸ As previously stated in the magic bullet analogy, there is nothing to stop the CNA code except for the initiator, unless the attacked State becomes aware of the CNA and takes steps to defend against it. Accordingly, should not the attacked State be able to target the civilian initiator after he has set in motion the CNA? If the State is able to stretch the targetability window to legally target the initiating civilian so long as the CNA is underway, can the civilian limit his exposure in any way?\nA solution might be found in the American Law Institute’s Model Penal Code (“MPC”). The MPC defines criminal conspiracy as a person conspiring with another person or group of persons to commit a crime if the individual, with the purpose of promoting or facilitating the crime: 1) agrees with the other person or group that one or more of them will engage in conduct constituting a crime; or 2) agrees to aid the other person or group in planning or committing the crime.²⁶⁹ However, the actor may, after having conspired to commit a crime, use as an affirmative defense the fact that the actor thwarted the success of the conspiracy after having manifested a complete and voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.²⁷⁰ By renouncing his support for the crime and thwarting the success of the conspiracy, the actor is able to undo the effort he put into conspiring to commit the crime.\n²⁶⁷ Eva Knopova, *New IHL Framework for Cyber Warfare: Master’s Thesis*, CHARLES UNIV. PRAGUE DEP’T INT’L L. 47 (2016).\n²⁶⁸ Id.\n²⁶⁹ American Law Institute, *MODEL PENAL CODE § 5.03* (Tent. Draft No. 4, 1955).\n²⁷⁰ Id.\n[Vol. XLII] As applied to the above issue regarding civilians directly participating in cyber hostilities, a civilian putting into place malicious code capable of autonomously conducting a CNA may be able to be certain he cannot be directly targeted by the party to an armed conflict by renouncing his support for the cyber hostilities and working to thwart further cyber hostilities by the code.²⁷¹ By attempting to prevent future direct targeting, the civilian may inadvertently leave himself exposed to attack by making his actions and identity known to the party. However, a party to an armed conflict abiding by LOAC would not be able to target a civilian who is no longer participating in hostilities.²⁷² Further, the civilian may take similar actions to renounce his participation and thwart further action by the code in an anonymous way.\nBy adopting this view, States who are a party to an armed conflict have better ground rules as to how to legally target non-state-affiliated civilians who are participating in cyber hostilities in a way that may not be covered by current IHL.²⁷³ Additionally, under this view, civilians will have a better understanding of how their actions, carried out as cyber operations, will be treated by States who are a party to an armed conflict. This view provides States and civilians with notice of how actions by civilians will be treated in cyberspace. Further, this view provides civilians who have participated in cyber hostilities, and who may be determined to be still participating based on the autonomous CNA code the individual initiated, an opportunity to remove themselves from hostilities. By taking steps discussed in the MPC to remove oneself from a conspiracy, the initiating individual can undo the bonds currently opening himself up to being targeted by a party to the conflict.²⁷⁴ By coming forward, renouncing his support for the ongoing cyber hostilities, and attempting to thwart the object of the cyber ²⁷¹ HENCKAERTS &amp; DOSWALD-BECK, supra note 260, at 19–20.\n²⁷² See generally INT’L &amp; OPERATIONAL L. DEP’T., THE JUDGE ADVOCATE GEN.’S LEGAL CTR. &amp; SCH., U.S. ARMY, LAW OF ARMED CONFLICT DESKBOOK, 7 (2015) (explaining that “[o]nly combatants or those directly participating in hostilities may be targeted... [n]on-combatants, including civilians and persons out of combat, may not intentionally be targeted”).\n²⁷³ HENCKAERTS &amp; DOSWALD-BECK, supra note 260, at 19–20.\n²⁷⁴ American Law Institute, supra note 269.\noperation, a civilian may prevent the targeted State from directly targeting the civilian.²⁷⁵ However, the civilian may also be creating an unexpected repercussion. The civilian directly taking part in cyber hostilities, favoring a party to an armed conflict by conducting cyber operations against an opponent party, also exposes himself to domestic criminal law pertaining to the cyber operations. By coming forward, the civilian may be opening himself up to prosecution under domestic criminal law in an effort to prevent being directly targeted by the State against whom the civilian directly participated in hostilities.²⁷⁶ This may create a disincentive for civilians to expose themselves as ongoing direct participants in cyber hostilities, but the damage is already done.\nThe only question that remains is attribution. Can the attacked State determine who the civilian is for either direct targeting purposes or domestic criminal prosecution? If the civilian believes so, the civilian could limit his exposure to being directly attacked as well as request leniency from the domestic criminal prosecution for his cooperation.²⁷⁷ The alternative is for the civilian to figure out a way to completely remove every trace of his participation in an ongoing cyber operation, thereby ensuring the attacked State does not discover the cyber operation, attribute it to the civilian, and directly attack him.²⁷⁸ Without this possible outlet, civilians who have had a change of heart and no longer wish to participate in cyber hostilities may be targeted in the future for previous participation in cyber hostilities, of which they no longer wish to be a part. Though not a perfect method for keeping civilians safe from being directly targeted, this method provides notice to the attacking State of the civilian’s previous acts, which are the acts the civilian no longer wishes to be held accountable for in the realm of armed conflict. The civilian’s renouncing of previous participation in hostilities will not absolve him of domestic law implications, but it will ensure he is not targeted in the future.²⁷⁹ [Vol. XLII] # VII. Conclusion Civilians directly participate in hostilities for numerous reasons. State-affiliated civilians might engage in direct participation as part of their job; non-state-affiliated civilians might directly participate out of a sense of patriotism, helping the underdog, or feeling like part of the fight. Cyberspace creates an environment unlike any other ever seen before, so civilians and States who are a party to an armed conflict struggle to understand how LOAC principles apply to their conduct. A misunderstanding by a civilian could lead to a prolonged period of being directly targeted by a party to a conflict; a misunderstanding by that party could lead to allegations of war crimes. All sides to a conflict, to include civilians, would benefit from consensus in the application of LOAC to the cyber domain.\nA consensus in the application of LOAC principles in the cyber domain could lead to stronger footing for States and citizens as the cyberspace domain becomes a larger battleground. Cyberspace issues such as anonymity, attribution, temporal considerations, and equal application of force between the physical and cyber domains all highlight the need to better define LOAC applications to the cyber domain.²⁸⁰ Specifically, civilians should be able to renounce their direct participation in cyber hostilities, and they should no longer face direct targeting by a party to a conflict for cyber operations taken previously. The Tallinn Manual spells out that civilians may be directly targeted so long as their causal link to the action exists.²⁸¹ States subscribing to this view may link civilians to cyber operations carried out previously, even after civilians have walked away and no longer desire to directly participate.\nThe ability to target civilians for previous acts of cyber hostilities when States believe a causal link still exists may lead to an expanded window of time during which a civilian may be targeted. Thus, States who are party to a conflict should be able to know with certainty that the civilian they intend to target is a lawful target, due to the civilian’s ongoing intent to directly participate in hostilities. The renunciation clause found in the Model Penal Code could be the solution to ending ²⁸⁰ Turns, supra note 62, at 281.\n²⁸¹ Id.\nmisunderstandings by civilians and parties to a conflict regarding direct participation and targeting.²⁸² Under this view, civilians have a way to guarantee they will no longer be directly targeted for past cyber operations amounting to direct participation in hostilities when the State may not know the civilian’s participation has concluded. In addition, this view provides an out for States directly targeting civilians for directly participating in cyber hostilities against the State because the civilian has the opportunity and incentive to come clean if the civilian no longer wishes to directly participate. By coming forward, civilians may open themselves up to domestic prosecution, but they guarantee they will not be directly targeted by a State.\nA final point is examined by asking: should civilians have to go to such lengths to ensure they will not be directly targeted by a State for previous instances of direct participation in hostilities? Further, should LOAC require citizens to take active steps to put States on notice as to the citizens’ activities to prevent being illegally targeted after the direct participation in hostilities has concluded? An argument can be made that this policy would be requiring too much of civilians, and it exposes civilians to a lose-lose scenario.\nOn the one hand, civilians want to ensure the temporal anomalies in the cyber domain do not mislead States into falsely believing civilians are continuing to directly participate in hostilities after participation has ended. On the other, civilians want to protect against domestic prosecution and initiating an investigation into their activities. Though a possible solution to the issue of civilians being overly or illegally targeted could be found in the Model Penal Code, international law may not be willing to support the process or potential side effects to civilians providing notice to States that the civilians have withdrawn from the direct participation in hostilities.\n^{}[]",

    "1014\nN.C. J. INT'L L.\n[Vol. XLII\n\n# I. Introduction\n\nThe Law of Armed Conflict (“LOAC”) has evolved over the past century and a half to protect civilians from the harms caused by war as well as to put all parties on notice as to their expected conduct. Civilians, like any other group, are not prohibited from directly participating in hostilities, but they lose their protection from being directly targeted for such time as they chose to do so.¹ This protection for civilians is easier understood as it is applied to the physical domain, for which it was created. The cyber domain is vastly different. Accordingly, civilians and States who are party to international armed conflicts are left to apply their own understanding of how LOAC principles should be applied to the cyber domain.\n\nThe difference of interpretation by civilians and parties to armed conflict could leave civilians overly exposed to direct attack and parties accountable for war crimes. This is especially true for non-state-affiliated civilians conducting cyber hostilities against a State that is party to an armed conflict. The differentiation between state-affiliated and non-state-affiliated civilians matters, because state-affiliated civilians should understand they may be injured or killed based on their work alongside and their proximity to armed forces. Thus, they are likely on notice that they may be directly targeted if directly participating in hostilities as well as considered collateral damage during a legal attack by an enemy State. In addition, civilians may open themselves up to an extended period of time during which they may be directly targeted based on the type of cyber operation they conduct.\n\nVarying views support the notion that civilians intermittently participating directly in hostilities may be targeted throughout a linked-together period of participation. Further, if a civilian were to launch against a State a cyber operation that activates at a set point in the future or after a forecasted event, the State could possibly treat the civilian as directly participating in hostilities long after the civilian actually initiated and participated in the cyber operation. This delayed direct targeting of the civilian can happen either because the State is unaware of exactly when the cyber operation was launched against it or because it interprets its\n\n¹ Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts, June 8, 1977, 110 Stat. 2104, 1125 U.N.T.S. 51 [hereinafter Protocol I].",

States that are party to an armed conflict could seek to lawfully target the civilian rather than await a domestic law prosecution. A possible solution to civilians being overly exposed to direct attack for their decision to directly participate in cyber hostilities could come from the Model Penal Code’s view of renouncing one’s role and thwarting the overall success of the act. Under this theory, a civilian could make the enemy State aware of the civilian’s plot to conduct an ongoing cyber operation against the State in an effort to absolve the civilian of being targeted in the future. However, these civilians may still face domestic criminal law repercussions for doing so.\n\n## II. The Treatment of Civilians in Traditional Warfare\n\nWhether it is their own loss of life or injury, the loss or injury of a relative, or the collateral damage of their property, civilians always suffer during war. Accordingly, major nation states have been working together for over a century to address the way traditional wars are fought, and they have sought to add a sense of humanity and require discrimination in targeting. In 1949, major nation states acceded to the Fourth Geneva Convention, which was called “The Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War” and sought to protect noncombatants.²\n\nPrior to the Geneva Conventions, civilians were left to the mercy of the combatants and their beliefs as to sparing civilians.³ The Geneva Conventions codified what had been inching closer to customary law for decades.⁴ The movement in this direction can be seen by the Lieber Code, which sought to regulate war; and later the Declaration of St. Petersburg in 1868, which prohibited the use of specific weapons for humanitarian reasons.⁵ The\n\n² Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, Aug. 12, 1949, 110 Stat. 2104, 75 U.N.T.S. 287 [hereinafter Geneva Convention].\n\n³ See ANICÉE VAN ENGELAND, CIVILIAN OR COMBATANT?: A CHALLENGE FOR THE 21ST CENTURY ix-xix (2011).\n\n⁴ Id.\n\n⁵ Id. at 13–14.",

Geneva Convention and the Additional Protocol\n\nThe Fourth Geneva Convention, which occurred in 1949, specifically sought to protect civilians during times of war.⁹ Under the Fourth Geneva Convention, persons taking no active part in the hostilities are to be treated humanely and without regard to their faith, sex, race, or religion.¹⁰ In addition, parties to the conflict are to establish neutral zones in regions of combat to shelter wounded and sick combatants and civilians taking no part in hostilities from the effects of war.¹¹ The wounded and the sick are specifically protected and should be provided particular care and respect.¹²\n\nIn addition to the Fourth Geneva Convention, the Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (“Additional Protocol I”) is a 1977 amendment to the Geneva Convention that focuses on the protection of victims of international armed conflicts.¹³ Protocol I calls for the protection and care of the wounded, sick, and shipwrecked regardless of whether they are military or civilians.¹⁴ To protect civilians from unnecessary injury or death, Protocol I obliges combatants to distinguish themselves from the civilian population while engaged\n\n⁶ *Id.*\n\n⁷ *Id.*\n\n⁸ *Id.*\n\n⁹ See Geneva Convention, *supra* note 2.\n\n¹⁰ *Id.* art. 3.\n\n¹¹ *Id.* art. 14.\n\n¹² *Id.*\n\n¹³ Protocol I, *supra* note 1, art. 3.\n\n¹⁴ *Id.*",

The purpose of the Additional Protocol is to protect civilians during armed conflicts, so a State using civilians as shields will be held accountable for the LOAC violation. In addition, the Hague Convention states that the right of belligerents to adopt means of injuring the enemy is not unlimited.²¹ By limiting the means used against the enemy, civilians are also protected from unnecessary suffering due to the type of weapons used in warfare.²² The purpose of the Hague Convention was to infuse humanity into armed conflicts.²³ By forcing States to use approved weapons, which take into account human suffering, civilians are indirectly protected from inhumane weaponry.\n\nProtocol I requires precautionary measures to be taken during\n\n15 Id. art. 44.\n16 Id. art. 48.\n17 Id. art. 50.\n18 Id. art. 48.\n19 Protocol I, supra note 12, art. 51.\n20 Id.\n21 Convention (IV) Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land and its Annex: Regulations Concerning the Laws and Customs of War on Land art. 22, Oct. 18, 1907, 36 Stat. 2277, U.N.T.S. 277.\n22 Id.\n23 Id.",

Civilians Directly Participating in Hostilities\n\nProtocol I protects civilians when viewed as innocent bystanders, but what if civilians participate in hostilities? Under the Protocol, parties to an international armed conflict may only target civilians for such time as the civilians take a direct part in hostilities.³¹ At that point, the civilians lose their civilian status protection and can then be targeted by combatants as legally permissible. The timeframe for which civilians can be targeted while directly participating in hostilities is defined by Protocol I as the time during which they are participating.³² However, it is important to keep in mind that the right of the noncombatant population to protection involves a corresponding duty to abstain\n\n24 Protocol I, supra note 1, art. 57.\n25 Id.\n26 Id.\n27 Id.\n28 Id. art. 58.\n29 Id. art. 57.\n30 Protocol I, supra note 1, art. 57.\n31 Id. art. 51.\n32 Id.",

If the civilian were to drop the rifle and run back to his house, he could no longer be targeted by the armed force. The targeting of civilians while directly participating in hostilities is rooted in LOAC; any potential domestic law violations would be determined by the civilian’s State. Civilians directly participating in hostilities may face repercussions based on their actions that violate domestic criminal laws as well as being targeted by the enemy State. The Third Geneva Convention also addresses civilians participating in hostilities.\n\nThe Third Geneva Convention (“Convention”) was adopted in 1949, and its purpose was the protection of the victims of war, both civilian and prisoner.³⁴ This Convention mainly addresses the treatment of prisoners of war, but it also recognizes civilian participation in hostilities.³⁵ Under this Convention, *levée en masse* is the spontaneous taking up of arms by civilian inhabitants of a non-occupied territory when the invading enemy approaches.³⁶ In this case, the civilians would be allowed prisoner-of-war status because they participated in hostilities spontaneously, without the time to form themselves into regular armed units; but they must carry arms openly and respect the laws of war.³⁷ Aside from prisoner of war status, LOAC also addresses combatant immunity and targetability.³⁸\n\nCombatant immunity is addressed in Protocol I, wherein it states that members of a Party’s armed force are combatants, and\n\n³³ Karma Nabulsi, *Evolving Conceptions of Civilians and Belligerents: One Hundred Years After the Hague Peace Conferences, in CIVILIANS IN WAR 9, 16* (Simon Chesterman ed., 2001) (quoting Henry Richmond Droop, *On the Relations Between an Invading Army and the Inhabitants, and the Conditions Under Which Irregular Troops Are Entitled to the Same Treatment as Regular Soldiers*, TRANSACTIONS OF THE GROTIUS SOCIETY 713 (1871)).\n\n³⁴ Geneva Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War art. 4, Aug. 12, 1949, 6 U.S.T. 3316, 75 U.N.T.S. 135 [hereinafter Geneva POW].\n\n³⁵ *Id.*\n\n³⁶ *Id.*\n\n³⁷ *Id.*\n\n³⁸ See Protocol I, supra note 1.",

Although non-combatants are not specifically prohibited from engaging in hostilities during an armed conflict, they may be directly targeted by the enemy and may face domestic criminal charges for their actions. Therefore, civilians engaging in hostilities would not be entitled to the combatant immunity that is given to combatants participating in an international armed conflict. Thus, civilians would only be entitled to prisoner of war status in limited cases, and they would not be entitled to combatant immunity.\n\nRegarding targetability, civilians are not to be targeted by the parties to an armed conflict, and civilians are to be generally protected against the dangers arising from military operations.⁴¹ However, LOAC allows civilians to be targeted by an armed force if and for so long as the civilian is directly participating in hostilities.⁴² Therefore, civilians enjoy the freedom from targetability so long as they are not taking a direct part in the hostilities. This freedom from direct targetability extends to a point under LOAC. A State choosing to target a legal military objective must determine if civilians and their property may be damaged by the attack.⁴³ If so, the State must conduct a balancing test to ensure the necessity of taking out the military objective outweighs the possible damage that could be caused to civilians and their property.⁴⁴ In summation, civilians do not have combatant immunity, they may be granted prisoner of war status during a levée en masse, and they cannot be directly targeted unless they are directly participating in hostilities.⁴⁵\n\nEven with the existence of International Humanitarian Law (“IHL”) seeking to protect civilians during times of war, civilians\n\n39 Id. art. 43.\n40 Id.\n41 Id. art. 51.\n42 Id.\n43 Geneva POW, supra note 34, art. 4.\n44 Id.\n45 Id.",

IHL exists with the purpose of protecting civilians during an ongoing armed conflict, but civilians can still be legally killed or injured.⁴⁶ If done according to the Geneva Conventions’ rules of discrimination and proportionality, nations may still strike enemy targets that lead to the loss of limbs, lives, and loved ones for civilians.⁴⁷ As examples, fighter jets can strike a weapons cache next to an apartment complex, a convoy can speed through a school playground,⁴⁸ and combatants can return fire in a crowded street. Aside from a country’s stance on ethics in times of war, the plight of civilians has practical drawbacks, such as the hatred survivors have toward foreign governments and protests following civilian casualties.⁴⁹ The United States military came to understand that it is important to win the hearts and minds of the civilian population in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.⁵⁰ Based on the implications that the United States was callously indifferent regarding civilian casualties, it started tracking the damage it caused and responded directly to affected families.⁵¹ The efforts by the U.S. government to recognize the importance of paying respect to the families of injured or killed civilians is another step toward protecting civilians during times of war.\n\nInternational Humanitarian Law provides the basis for the protection of civilians during an ongoing armed conflict, but does that translate from the physical world to the cyber world? The cyberspace domain offers capabilities that are far different from the physical domain. Cyberspace provides the cloak of anonymity that may shield civilians and even States from being identified as the responsible party for cyber operations. The protections afforded to civilians have been roughly translated from the physical to the cyber domain by the Tallinn Manual’s International Group of Experts as well as Guidance by the International Committee of the Red Cross.\n\n### III.

The Tallinn Manual states that civilians are defined in the cyberspace domain as they are under the Additional Protocol I of the Geneva Convention.⁵² Specifically, civilians are defined in terms of neither being members of armed forces nor members of a *levée en masse*.⁵³ As such, individual civilians, as well as civilian populations, shall not be the object of a cyber-attack by a party to the armed conflict.⁵⁴ A cyber-attack is any cyber operation or activity that is reasonably expected to cause injury or death to a person or the damage or destruction to objects.⁵⁵ In addition, LOAC applies to the targeting of people or objects during an armed conflict regardless of the means or methods of warfare that are used.⁵⁶ These seemingly broad definitions are key to protecting civilians during armed conflicts because parties to the conflict are held accountable for actions taken which are incompatible with the law of war.\n\n## A. Cyber Operations and the Law of Armed Conflict\n\nDefining cyber warfare, as a whole, is better understood by looking at its component parts. Cyberspace, in general, is the domain within the information environment made up of the interdependent network of information technology infrastructures and the resident data.⁵⁷ Cyber warfare can be viewed as a combined concept of cyberspace operations, offensive cyberspace operations, and defensive cyberspace operations.⁵⁸ Cyber operations are the employment of cyberspace capabilities where the primary purpose is to achieve objectives in and through\n\n⁵² TALLINN MANUAL ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER WARFARE 104-05 (Michael N.

To do so, States conduct network reconnaissance for both operational requirements, as well as to ensure planned attacks do not cause collateral damage and casualties outside of what is acceptable under LOAC principles.⁶⁶\n\n⁵⁹ Id.\n\n⁶⁰ Id.\n\n⁶¹ Id.\n\n⁶² David Turns, *Cyber Warfare and the Notion of Direct Participation in Hostilities*, 17 J.

Due to the UN Charter being written long before the advent of the Internet, the UN Charter was not written with a clear intention of including cyber operations.⁶⁷ Scholars and experts adhering to this view believe the UN Charter encompasses only physical attacks, and cyber operations will almost certainly not involve the use of physical force.⁶⁸ According to this line of thought, a country would not violate LOAC by deliberately launching cyber operations at civilian-owned targets.⁶⁹ However, the Tallinn Manual examines cyber operations as falling under the UN Charter and being subject to LOAC.⁷⁰\n\nThe LOAC principle of distinction, as codified in Additional Protocol I, and incorporated into the Tallinn Manual, requires that parties to an armed conflict distinguish between the civilian population and combatants, as well as between civilian objects and military objectives.⁷¹ This requirement seeks to protect civilians and their property by holding the parties to armed conflict accountable for the targets they choose to attack. Further, the principle of distinction precludes any rationale or justification by a party for an attack not permitted by LOAC.⁷² In cases where there is doubt as to whether a person is a civilian in the cyber domain, that person shall be considered a civilian.⁷³ This requirement complicates the cyber battlefield, because there are many civilians using computers and computer networks, and it may be very difficult to discern who is and is not a civilian.\n\nDetermining whether actors in the cyberspace domain are civilians, and may possibly be targeted when directly participating in hostilities during an international armed conflict, is difficult. Inaccurate attribution in cyberspace may leave vulnerable the civilians caught in the crossfire.

The Objects of Cyber Attacks\n\nThe Tallinn Manual also discusses who may be made the object of cyber-attacks and lists them as: 1) members of the armed forces; 2) members of organized armed groups; 3) civilians taking a direct part in hostilities; and 4) participants in a *levée en masse* during an international armed conflict.⁸⁷ It should be noted that the first two categories can be made the object of an attack based on their status; however, the last two categories can only be made targets based on their actions.

Inhabitants of unoccupied territory during an international armed conflict who engage in cyber operations as part of a levée en masse are afforded combatant immunity and prisoner of war status.⁹³ In addition, participants in a cyber-based levée en masse are targetable throughout the period of their participation therein.⁹⁴ To be considered a levée en masse, the participating individuals must be inhabitants of non-occupied territory, who upon the invading enemy’s approach, take up arms to resist them.⁹⁵ In the cyber context, “taking up arms” refers to engaging in cyber operations against the enemy.⁹⁶\n\nThis “taking up arms” in cyberspace is theoretical based on the facts that would have to exist for a cyber levée en masse to be\n\n⁸⁸ *Id.*\n\n⁸⁹ *Id.*\n\n⁹⁰ Nils Melzer, *Interpretive Guidance on the Notion of Direct Participation Under International Humanitarian Law*, INT’L COMM.

The difference is the virtually untested nature of the cyberspace domain. It remains unclear exactly how States are to behave in cyberspace, what rises to the level of a cyber-attack, and what level of physical domain response is authorized for a particular cyber-attack. These and other unresolved translations from the physical realm to the cyber domain make difficult the protection of civilians during an international armed conflict. A step further would be the impact on civilians when they decide to directly participate in cyber hostilities.\n\n## IV.

Participation in hostilities can either be direct or indirect; direct participation is the engagement in specific hostile acts.¹¹⁸ The concept of hostilities is best described as the aggregate of all hostile acts carried out by all individuals, either armed forces, organized armed groups, or civilians, during an armed conflict.¹¹⁹\n\nThe specific acts carried out by civilians qualify as direct participation in hostilities if they meet all of the following criteria:\n\n¹¹¹ Cyber, supra note 57.\n¹¹² Geneva POW, supra note 34, art. 4; TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 52, at Rule 35.\n¹¹³ Melzer, supra note 90, at Part II.B.\n¹¹⁴ Id.\n¹¹⁵ Id.\n¹¹⁶ Id.\n¹¹⁷ Id. at Part VI.\n¹¹⁸ Id.\n¹¹⁹ Melzer, supra note 90, at Part VI.",

For there to be direct causation, there must be a sufficiently close causal relationship between the act and the resulting harm.¹²³ Specifically, direct causation should be brought about in one causal step.¹²⁴ Individual actions that can be viewed as merely supporting one side to an armed conflict or that only build up or maintain the capacity of a party is excluded from the concept of direct participation in hostilities.¹²⁵ For example, providing supplies for a party or financing the actions of a party to an armed conflict would bring about a result, but there is not direct causation for the potential harm. Other examples of indirect participation would be scientific research and design, recruitment and the training of personnel, and the production or transportation of weapons or equipment.¹²⁶\n\nThe third criterion requires there be a belligerent nexus, which is that an act must be specifically designed to directly cause the required threshold of harm in support of a party to the armed conflict.¹²⁷ Accordingly, the act must be objectively likely to inflict harm, and it must be specifically designed to do so in\n\n¹²⁰ *Id.* at Part V.\n¹²¹ *Id.*\n¹²² *Id.*\n¹²³ *Id.* at Part V.2.b.\n¹²⁴ *Id.* at Part V.2.f.\n¹²⁵ Melzer, *supra* note 90, at Part V.\n¹²⁶ *Id.* at Part V.2.b.\n¹²⁷ *Id.* at Part V.3.",

The belligerent nexus requirement is important, because there are many activities during armed conflict that cause a considerable level of harm but fall short of direct participation in hostilities. This is exemplified by violent crimes committed for reasons unrelated to the conflict, such as robberies or murders, as well as the theft of military equipment for private use or sale.¹³⁰ Also requiring special attention is use of individual self-defense or defense of others. If a civilian uses force to protect his property from looting, he is not doing so with a belligerent nexus.¹³¹ Instead, he is acting out of self-defense.\n\nUnderstanding whether hostilities by civilians during armed conflict rise to the level of direct participation is not enough. The defining moment of when the direct participation in hostilities begins and ends is also important. Preparatory measures leading up to the execution of the specific act, and the movement to and from the location of the execution, all constitute integral parts of the act.¹³² Accordingly, IHL concerns itself with more than just exactly when the act took place; it looks at the totality of the circumstances surrounding the civilian’s direct participation in hostilities.¹³³ This is a significant point, because civilians lose their protection against direct attacks for such time as they directly participate in hostilities.¹³⁴\n\nPreparatory measures are those that IHL would describe as military operations in preparation for an attack and which are so closely linked to the execution of the specific act that they constitute an integral part of the act.¹³⁵ Even so, there is no requirement that the preparatory measures occur immediately prior to the specific act or even in close geographic proximity to the\n\n128 Id.\n129 Id.\n130 Id.\n131 Melzer, supra note 90, at Part V.3.\n132 Id. at Part VI.\n133 Id.\n134 Id.\n135 Id.",

In this illustration, the preparatory measures taken by the civilian bomb maker in his garage, as well as the transit to and from the place where he plants the bomb, would all be considered part of the direct participation in hostilities. Thus, the bomb maker could be targeted at any point from when he starts building the bomb in his garage until he returns home from planting it. Also included in general preparatory measures would be the transporting of personnel, gathering of intelligence, and equipping and instructing armed forces.¹³⁷ Where the execution of a hostile act does not require deployment, such as hostilities in cyberspace, the duration of the act should be limited to the immediate execution of the act.¹³⁸\n\n## B.

Determining whether a civilian directly participated in conventional hostilities is complex by itself; making the same determination in cyber-hostilities is especially so.¹⁴⁴ Civilians conducting cyber-attacks related to an armed conflict would qualify as an act of direct participation in hostilities.¹⁴⁵ A cyber-attack is defined as a cyber operation that is reasonably expected to cause injury or death to persons or damage or destruction to objects.¹⁴⁶ Accordingly, civilians conducting cyber-attacks in this way would meet the three criteria for directly participating in hostilities. Other examples of direct participation include civilians conducting cyber operations with the intent to identify vulnerabilities in a targeted computer network or system, or civilians designing malware to take advantage of vulnerabilities in the systems of a party to an armed conflict.¹⁴⁷ Further examples in the cyber domain include civilians using cyber means to gather information on enemy operations and passing that information to the other armed force in the conflict as well as conducting distributed denial of service operations against military systems.¹⁴⁸\n\nOn the other hand, not all cyber operations by civilians would rise to the level of direct participation in hostilities. For example, designing malware for a specific purpose and making it available online, even if it is actually used by someone else to conduct an attack during an armed conflict, would not be considered direct participation.¹⁴⁹ What would be lacking would be the threshold of harm in the first criterion; the malware creator never had the intended or actual effect of negatively affecting military operations or capabilities. Another example would be civilians simply maintaining computer equipment generally, even if that equipment were eventually used in hostilities.¹⁵⁰ Again, what would be\n\n¹⁴³ *Id.*\n\n¹⁴⁴ Emily Crawford, *Virtual Battlegrounds: Direct Participation in Cyber Warfare*, 9 J.

Cyber operations during an armed conflict that are taken for purely criminal or private reasons would not qualify as direct participation in hostilities.¹⁵¹ As an example, a criminal using cyber means to steal funds from a party to a conflict for purely personal gain, and not to negatively affect the party, would not be directly participating in hostilities. What is difficult about this example is that the party to the armed conflict would have to determine the intent of the civilian actor, which could be disguised as purely personal and criminal when it could in fact be aimed at adversely affecting the party to the conflict. Taken a step further, if the individual stole the money from the party in order to finance particular military operations, the operation to steal the money would be considered a direct participation in hostilities.¹⁵²\n\nPreparatory measures in cyberspace differ from those taken in the physical domain. Because civilians can be directly targeted for the duration of time during which they are directly participating in hostilities, it is important for parties to an armed conflict to understand the timeframe of direct participation.¹⁵³ The actions taken in cyberspace immediately preceding or subsequent to a qualifying act of direct participation are included in the preparatory measures.¹⁵⁴ As an example, a civilian travelling to and from the location of the computer he uses to mount a cyber operation would be included in the preparatory measures, and the civilian could be directly targeted in transit.¹⁵⁵ The time for preparatory measures may even extend as far backward and forward in time as the causal link to the action exists.¹⁵⁶ For example, in a cyber operation this would include the time when the civilian first starts to explore the vulnerabilities of the system of a party to an armed conflict, the time the individual creates the cyber tool to exploit the vulnerabilities, the period of time the civilian attacks the system, and through to the time the individual assesses\n\n¹⁵¹ TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 52, at Rule 35, comment 6.\n¹⁵² Id.\n¹⁵³ Id.\n¹⁵⁴ Id. at Rule 35, comment 7.\n¹⁵⁵ Id.\n¹⁵⁶ Id.",

The actions taken by civilians in the cyber domain have some parallels to the physical domain, but they also vary widely. The emplacement of a logic bomb, which is designed to activate at some point in the future upon either a command or after a predetermined period of time, is an example.¹⁵⁷ The majority of the Tallinn Manual’s International Group of Experts takes the position that the time frame for which the civilian is directly participating, and can thus be targeted, is from the beginning of his involvement in mission planning until the individual terminates his active role in the operation.¹⁵⁸ It is important to point out that the end of the period of direct participation may not sync up with the point when the damage occurs.¹⁵⁹ For example, the first civilian may have created and emplaced the logic bomb, which is awaiting a command prompt to activate it. A second civilian may be the one to actually command the bomb to activate. In this example, the first civilian could have halted his period of direct participation and would no longer be directly targetable when the damage actually occurs. Thus, the key is for parties to determine when individuals are targetable based on when their participation begins and ends.¹⁶⁰\n\n## C. Determination of Direct Participation in Hostilities Complicated by Cyberspace-Specific Issues\n\nThe delayed effects of cyber operations complicate the accurate determination of precisely when a civilian is directly participating in cyber hostilities. The majority of the International Group of Experts takes the position that a civilian is directly participating in hostilities from the beginning of his involvement through the point in time where the civilian terminates an active role in the operation.¹⁶¹ The problem with this majority view is that it does not make clear to the participating civilian or to the\n\n¹⁵⁷ TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 52, at Rule 35, comment 8.\n¹⁵⁸ Id.\n¹⁵⁹ Id.\n¹⁶⁰ Id.\n¹⁶¹ Id. at Rule 35, comment 6.",

The civilian may terminate an active role by no longer checking the status of the ongoing cyber operation, but the State may still attribute the operation to the civilian and target him. The State may not discover the ongoing cyber operation until after the civilian has terminated an active role, but the State has no way of knowing the civilian has terminated his active role in the ongoing cyber operation.\n\nThe logic bomb example parallels civilian operations in the physical world. Coalition Forces fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan faced road-side improvised explosive devices (“IEDs”), which were responsible for causing death and injury to troops as well as damage to military objects. If a civilian was responsible for building, transporting, emplacing, and setting off the IED, the civilian could be targeted throughout the entire process.¹⁶² The beginning and end of the civilian’s direct participation in hostilities could be measured from the time he began sourcing parts for the bomb until the time he set off the IED and transited back from the bombsite. Similarly, the civilian responsible for the logic bomb in the aforementioned example could be targeted from the time he began creating the logic bomb until he commands the logic bomb to activate. However, technology in the cyber domain varies widely from technology in the physical domain.\n\nIn the cyber domain, individuals can create programs capable of running autonomously or semi-autonomously. A computer network attack (“CAN”) is defined as either a cyber, electronic, or physical attack against an information technology facility or against computer equipment.¹⁶³ Most of these CNAs are carried out by cyber operations, which use malicious code to infect enemy computers in order to exploit weaknesses in software, system configuration, or computer security practices.¹⁶⁴ Cyber operations also include the use of bots, or remotely, or semi-autonomously controlled programs infecting computers, as well as botnets, which perform espionage by transmitting data between themselves while\n\n¹⁶² *Id.* at Rule 35, comment 4 (providing that there is well-known, ongoing debate as to whether the assembly of an IED qualifies as direct participation in hostilities).\n\n¹⁶³ See generally CLAY WILSON, COMPUTER ATTACK AND CYBERTERRORISM 3-11 (2009) (providing insight on different types of attacks against computers).\n\n¹⁶⁴ *Id.*",

The Group of Experts is split regarding repeated cyber operations. One view is in line with the ICRC in that each cyber act must be treated separately in terms of direct participation analysis.¹⁷² On the other hand, another view is that it would make more operational sense if direct participation begins with the first cyber operation and continues throughout the period of intermittent activity.¹⁷³ The latter view removes the “revolving door” effect and simplifies target ability by making the intermittent activity a singular, start-to-finish cyber operation.\n\n165 Id.\n166 Id.\n167 Id.\n168 Id.\n169 TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 52, at Rule 35, comment 9.\n170 Id.\n171 Id. at Rule 35, comment 10.\n172 Id.\n173 Id.",
    "2017 THE TARGETING OF NON-STATE-AFFILIATED CIVILIANS 1039\n\nThe Tallinn Experts were also divided over the issue of presumption against direct participation.¹⁷⁴ Recall that the Tallinn Manual provides that in cases where there is doubt as to whether an individual is a civilian, that individual should be treated like a civilian.¹⁷⁵ The policy behind this principle is to ensure that civilians are protected to the utmost extent during armed conflicts. Some Tallinn Experts take this same line of thinking regarding civilians believed to be directly participating in hostilities.¹⁷⁶ These experts believe civilians in this predicament should be given the benefit of the doubt.¹⁷⁷\n\nHowever, other Tallinn Experts take the position that when there is doubt as to whether a civilian is directly participating in hostilities, the attacking state must review the relevant information available and act reasonably in the circumstances in determining whether to conduct the attack.¹⁷⁸ The policy behind this method rests in the attacking state’s ability to identify which targets are legal targets based on a reasonable review of the available information. The importance of these two views cannot be understated. Some experts side with protecting civilians to the maximum extent possible, while others favor the States’ ability to act while following LOAC principles.\n\nAlthough the Tallinn Manual agrees with ICRC Guidance’s requirements of a threshold of harm—a causal link between the action and the harm and a belligerent nexus—generally, the Tallinn Manual’s application of the ICRC’s guidance is a variation of the ICRC’s direct participation in hostilities legal regime involving cyber actions.¹⁷⁹ The Tallinn manual does not have a requirement for physical damage to objects, so actions that may not qualify as cyber-attacks may still satisfy the criterion for the threshold of harm if the action has negatively affected the targeted State.¹⁸⁰ Specifically, the Tallinn Manual provides that a civilian’s\n\n¹⁷⁴ Id. at Rule 35, comment 12.\n¹⁷⁵ TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 52, at Rule 33.\n¹⁷⁶ Id. at Rule 35, comment 12.\n¹⁷⁷ Id.\n¹⁷⁸ Id.\n¹⁷⁹ See Collin Allan, Direct Participation in Hostilities from Cyberspace, 50 VA.

For example, a civilian may be directly targeted under the Tallinn Manual view for his role in assembling and storing the cyber equivalent of an IED because the individual intends the same harm as the person arming and detonating it.¹⁸⁶ By comparing the Tallinn Manual’s view with the ICRC Guidance, it is possible that the Tallinn Manual lowers the standards for what is required for civilians to be directly participating in cyber hostilities.¹⁸⁷ Therefore, civilians participating in hostilities through cyber means may be targetable in more situations than under the ICRC framework.¹⁸⁸\n\n## V.

    "2017 THE TARGETING OF NON-STATE-AFFILIATED CIVILIANS 1043\n\nThe Tallinn Manual’s international group of experts concurs that individual contractors and civilians may only be directly targeted based on their direct participation in hostilities during an armed conflict.²⁰⁴ However, there are issues that arise in cyberspace regarding the use of contractors and civilians to perform specific military operations. Unlike traditional warfare, where almost all military operations were carried out by troops and equipment, modern warfare introduces the use of cyber capabilities which conduct a portion of the military operations. An example is the hiring of a private company by a party to an armed conflict that is later contracted to perform specific military operations.²⁰⁵ Based on the military operations, the company would qualify as an organized armed group belonging to the party to the conflict.²⁰⁶ Therefore, the civilians employed as private contractors would be considered belonging to the organized armed group. However, even if the civilians were not to be considered as belonging to the organized armed group, they would still only be directly targetable when and if they are directly participating in hostilities.²⁰⁷\n\nCivilian government employees are also employed in positions requiring them to conduct cyber operations during an armed conflict, such as positions within an intelligence agency.²⁰⁸ If the group of civilians conducting cyber operations qualifies as an organized armed group, the civilian members are subject to attack regardless of direct participation in hostilities.²⁰⁹ Otherwise, the civilian employees are only directly targetable when they are directly participating in hostilities. As a result, the historic view of citizens carrying out actions typically performed by members of armed forces may be problematic when analyzing the cyber domain construct. The traditional view of warfare holds that private contractors and civilian employees operating in an organized armed group, affiliated with armed forces in an armed conflict, would not be entitled to combatant status.²¹⁰\n\n204 TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 52, at Rule 34, comment 7.\n205 Id.\n206 Id.\n207 Id.\n208 Id. at Rule 34, comment 8.\n209 Id. at Rule 34, comment 7.\n210 See Sean Watts, Notion of Combatancy in Cyber Warfare, FOURTH INT’L.

By requiring state affiliation for civilian employees, it preserves concern for the principle of distinction in CNA from the Brussels criteria.²¹⁵ States employing civilians to conduct cyber operations are less likely to be doing so to prevent the enemy from attacking the civilians.²¹⁶ Instead, States are likely taking advantage of the economic, training, and recruiting advantages that develop as a result of not being limited to armed forces filling these behind-the-lines roles.²¹⁷ The fact that cyber operations take\n\nON CYBER CONFLICT, 235, 242 (2012), https://ccdcoe.org/cycon/2012/proceedings/d2r1s10_watts.pdf [https://perma.cc/X6F2-TTRP] [hereinafter Notion of Combatancy].\n\n²¹¹ Id.\n\n²¹² See id. at 245 (citing the Project of an International Declaration Concerning the Laws and Customs of War, Aug. 27, 1874, 4 Martens Nouveau Recueil (ser. 2) 219 (“1874 Brussels Declaration”)).\n\n²¹³ Id.\n\n²¹⁴ Id.\n\n²¹⁵ Id.\n\n²¹⁶ See Notion of Combatancy, supra note 210, at 246.\n\n²¹⁷ Id.",

The view of letting state-affiliation drive combatant status determinations for cyberspace operations provides civilians with combatant status, or a version of it, while parties to an armed conflict can still conduct warfare and be no worse off.

The majority of the participation by a state-affiliated civilian cyber scientist would be viewed as indirect participation.²³² However, there are possible situations where a civilian’s particular expertise could have an exceptional and potentially decisive value for the outcome of an armed conflict.²³³ An example would be a computer programmer who researches and writes attack programs, one of which is used to incapacitate the enemy’s network controlling the launch of weapons systems.²³⁴ In this example, the civilian scientist could be responsible for the turning point in the conflict, thus shifting his participation from indirect to direct.²³⁵ The importance of this example is that the State hosting the state-affiliated civilian and the civilian need to understand the possible implications of having the scientist participate, directly or indirectly, in hostilities. Further, the enemy State is going to have to make a call as to whether it can directly target the civilian scientist or attack the military target and consider the scientist collateral damage.\n\n## B.

These hackers carry out cyber operations against perceived enemy computer systems, without the control or oversight from their government but seek common political ends.²³⁶ Hacktivists would seem to receive no protection due to their direct participation in hostilities; however, hacktivists could arguably be considered participants in a *levée en masse* if they took up arms spontaneously upon the enemy approaching, lack organization, and carried arms openly.²³⁷ If so, hacktivists would be entitled to POW status, but they could be directly targeted while directly participating in hostilities.²³⁸ The LOAC principles have not been updated for cyber operations, so it is difficult to play out exactly how non-state-affiliated civilians are to be treated during international armed conflicts. Ideally, IHL would be universally understood by states engaged in armed conflict and the non-state-affiliated civilians who choose to directly participate in cyber hostilities would be on notice as to how their actions will be measured.\n\nAlso, made difficult by the landscape and types of operations carried out in cyberspace is the direct targeting of those individuals directly participating. Aside from anonymity being a difficult hurdle in cyberspace, the determination as to whether a physical attack is justified in response to a cyber action is still theoretical. Furthermore, neither treaties nor customary international law have established the illegality of espionage, either in the physical world or in cyberspace. Thus, civilians conducting CNAs on behalf of a State which is party to an armed conflict may not be directly participating in hostilities. Further, customary international law has not recognized data manipulation and deletions as rising to the level of hostilities, so civilians conducting these types of CNAs would not be directly participating in hostilities.\n\n## VI.

A major concern with this LOAC application is the effect it has on civilians. As the law of war has evolved, the protection of civilians has been one of the key tenets from the outset. The Fourth Geneva Convention sought to protect civilian persons taking no part in hostilities as well as the wounded and sick.²³⁹ The Convention also prohibited an occupying power from destroying real and personal property belonging to civilians.²⁴⁰ The Additional Protocol I of the Geneva Convention calls for the protection of civilians from unnecessary injury or death and obliges combatants to distinguish themselves from the civilian population while engaged in an attack.²⁴¹ The civilian population is specifically protected under Part IV, which demands the parties to at all times distinguish between civilian population and combatants as well as between civilian objects and military objectives.²⁴² Further, Protocol I prohibits parties from making the civilian population the object of an attack, which also prohibits acts or threats having the intent to terrorize the civilian population.²⁴³\n\nThe protections provided by LOAC are two-fold. On one hand, they are meant to inform parties to an armed conflict regarding how to conduct themselves while at war. On the other hand, LOAC provides notice to civilians affected by armed conflict as to the treatment they can expect from the parties to the conflict. The relative nuance of cyberspace operations, as compared to traditional warfare, makes difficult the determination of direct participation in hostilities by citizens. If LOAC principles are incapable of adequately putting parties to armed conflict and citizens on notice, it should be amended for this purpose.\n\n²³⁹ Geneva Convention, supra note 2, art. 15.\n²⁴⁰ Id.\n²⁴¹ Id. art. 44.\n²⁴² Protocol I, supra note 1, art. 48.\n²⁴³ Id. art. 51.",

Temporal Considerations in the Cyber Domain\n\nDirect participation in hostilities by civilians operating in the cyber domain is vastly different than participation in the physical domain due to temporal considerations. Actions taken in cyberspace are not easily detected as they are happening, and they are often created for use in the future. For example, computer network attacks involve the use of malicious code to either infect an enemy’s computer system or to exploit weaknesses in the software, system configuration, or security practices.²⁴⁴ Additionally, bots and even botnets are remotely-controlled or semi-autonomous computer programs that infect computers and systems to transmit data obtained by the system or instruct the system to operate a certain way.²⁴⁵ Hackers have even designed ways to exploit computers and systems in a way to launch programs anonymously and autonomously from thousands of infected computers.²⁴⁶ Accordingly, cyber operations differ greatly from physical operations due to the timing of how the operations are carried out. Cyber operations can be set to take place at a certain time in the future or after a certain event has occurred.\n\nThe ICRC Guidance and the Tallinn Manual both touch on these temporal considerations. The ICRC provides that preparatory acts can be treated as separate acts and distinguished from the act that is the object of the direct participation in hostilities.²⁴⁷ Therefore, a civilian participating in hostilities may\n\n²⁴⁴ See WILSON, supra note 163, at 39 (explaining the characteristics of malicious code).\n\n²⁴⁵ Id. at 38 (explaining that “[a]utomated programs, or ‘bots’ . . . are increasingly autonomous, rapid, and difficult to detect . . .

    "2017 THE TARGETING OF NON-STATE-AFFILIATED CIVILIANS 1051\n\nconduct a series of acts, each directly participating in hostilities, over a period of time that lead up to the object of the direct participation. The Tallinn Manual provides that the scope of direct participation includes the actions immediately preceding and those subsequent to the qualifying act of direct participation in hostilities.²⁴⁸ The majority of the Tallinn Experts agree that a civilian is directly targetable only for the duration of the direct participation in hostilities, regardless of when the actual effects are realized.²⁴⁹ Yet, some of the experts take the position that the time period during which a civilian can be directly targeted extends for as long as there is a causal link to the intended harm.²⁵⁰ That is, a civilian is targetable as far upstream and as far downstream as that civilian’s causal link exists between the action taken and the intended harm.²⁵¹ As an example, a civilian may be targeted as early as when he begins a cyber operation by probing the enemy’s system and carry through to when he conducts the cyber operation against the system.²⁵² The civilian may even be targeted after the cyber operation, when he is conducting a damage assessment and determining whether to conduct another operation against the system.²⁵³\n\nThese temporal considerations are worth exploring because they mostly exist only in the cyber context. Accordingly, there may be a disconnect between how States view cyber operations versus operations in the physical world due to the way LOAC principles were developed for the physical world. Though it is possible to parallel these temporal considerations by discussing IEDs emplaced for the destruction of the enemy State’s equipment and the injury of its people, there is not a precise match. While IEDs can be emplaced with the intent of them going off in the future upon being activated, IEDs with this setup cannot be controlled and changed like their logic bomb counterpart in the cyber world.

It would not be as clean cut in the cyber world based on the ability of the logic bomb builder and the one who activates it to carry out the entire operation in complete anonymity as well as being able to control the logic bomb once it is emplaced.\n\nFor the sake of clarifying the discussion below, the civilians being discussed are non-state-affiliated civilians. State-affiliated civilians are those who operate as either private contractors on behalf of the State or as civilian employees, who are employed by the State. These civilians are better aware of their exposure to direct attack based on the nature of their service, which could include operational as well as geographic proximity to armed forces. Thus, the State and the state-affiliated civilians are on notice as to whether and for how long the civilians may be directly targeted by the opposing state during an armed conflict.\n\nAdditional Protocol I provides that civilians and civilian populations enjoy general protection against dangers arising from military operations.²⁵⁴ However, civilians forfeit this protection if and for so long as they directly participate in hostilities.²⁵⁵ Direct participation by civilians in cyberspace is not always clear. The International Group of Experts was split regarding repeated cyber operations by civilians that qualified as direct participation in hostilities.²⁵⁶ Some of the experts side with ICRC guidance, which provides that each act must be treated separately as separate acts of direct participation.²⁵⁷ Other experts conclude separate direct participation analysis made little operational sense and believe it would create a “revolving door” effect regarding targetability.²⁵⁸ This group of experts believes direct participation by the civilian begins with the first cyber operation he participates in and continues throughout the period of intermittent activity.²⁵⁹ This incongruent application of existing LOAC principles on cyberspace operations demonstrates the potential for civilians and\n\n²⁵⁴ Protocol I, supra note 1, art. 51.\n²⁵⁵ Id.\n²⁵⁶ TALLINN MANUAL, supra note 52, Rule 35, comment 7.\n²⁵⁷ Id.\n²⁵⁸ Id.\n²⁵⁹ Id.",

At what point could the civilian be targeted by the State? If the State discovers the logic bomb months after it was released by the civilian, and assuming the State can attribute it to the civilian, can the State target the civilian then? Under ICRC guidance, the civilian could be directly targeted for each act of direct participation in hostilities.²⁶⁰ Accordingly, the civilian could be directly attacked when producing the logic bomb with the intent to launch a CNA against the State, if done so in support of another party to the conflict, and when the civilian actually launches the logic bomb.²⁶¹ However, ICRC guidance would not likely support a direct attack against the civilian if discovered months after it was launched. Under the Tallinn Manual’s viewpoint, the civilian may be directly targeted.²⁶²\n\nAs discussed above, it may be unclear to civilians directly participating in hostilities in the cyber domain as to how their actions could be interpreted by parties to an armed conflict. Aside from civilians conducting intermittent direct participation in hostilities in cyberspace, civilians may also be unclear as to their exposure for direct targeting due to the uncertain application of LOAC principles to the cyber domain. Specifically, civilians launching autonomous or semi-autonomous programs to attack computer networks may directly participate in hostilities by building the code and program for the specific purpose as well as directly participate by launching the CNA.²⁶³ However, these civilians may at some point decide they no longer wish to pursue the action against a party to an armed conflict.\n\n²⁶⁰ JEAN-MARIE HENCKAERTS &amp; LOUISE DOSWALD-BECK, CUSTOMARY INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW VOL. 1: RULES 1, 21 (2005).\n\n²⁶¹ Id.\n\n²⁶² Id. at 23.\n\n²⁶³ Turns, supra note 62, at 281.",

Change of Heart for Civilians Directly Participating in Cyber Hostilities\n\nHow might a civilian make clear to a State embroiled in an armed conflict that the civilian who conducted a cyber operation against the State no longer wishes to directly participate in cyber hostilities? In the physical domain, the civilian would simply stop shooting at the party, collecting arms to use against the party, building bombs to emplace in roadways, or collecting money to finance attacks against the party to the conflict.²⁶⁴ An example which could parallel the cyber domain would be a civilian bomb maker who makes a bomb and emplaces that bomb in a road in an effort to target a party to an armed conflict. However, the bomb maker could make clear his intentions to no longer directly participate by putting up a sign warning of the bomb, digging up the bomb, or telling the party the location of the bomb. In cyberspace, a civilian who creates the malicious code for the CNA and launches it may not be able to recall the code or stop the cyber operation once it has begun.²⁶⁵ Once the malicious code is discovered, the targeted State may attack the civilian because it is impossible to precisely determine if the civilian has stopped directly participating in cyber hostilities. The State could argue the civilian is still monitoring and directing the logic bomb or malicious code.\n\nThe advanced technology which enables civilians to directly participate in hostilities could make it difficult for both the civilian and the party to the armed conflict to know when the civilian is no longer directly participating.²⁶⁶ The civilian who produces the malicious code for a CNA concludes his direct participation when he stops working on or even finishes the code. Would the civilian who launches the malicious code for a CNA conclude his direct participation when the code is launched? What if the malicious code were autonomous or semi-autonomous, and it would continue to operate without the aid from the civilian? This would seem to be a magic bullet fired in the physical world. In the physical domain, the bullet would lose speed and fall to the earth. However, malicious code launched in the cyber domain may\n\n²⁶⁴ *Id.*\n\n²⁶⁵ *Id.*\n\n²⁶⁶ *Id.*",

May the civilian launching this code be directly targeted until the malicious code ceases to operate as part of the CNA?\n\nCurrent interpretations by the ICRC and the International Group of Experts contributing to the Tallinn Manual apply IHL to the cyber domain and determine that the civilian launching the CNA code can only be targeted so long as he is directly participating in hostilities, which is when he is actively engaged.²⁶⁷ The ICRC and the Group of Experts are unwilling to extend the window of targetability to include ongoing hostilities set in motion by the individual unleashing the malicious code aimed at conducting a CNA.²⁶⁸ As previously stated in the magic bullet analogy, there is nothing to stop the CNA code except for the initiator, unless the attacked State becomes aware of the CNA and takes steps to defend against it. Accordingly, should not the attacked State be able to target the civilian initiator after he has set in motion the CNA? If the State is able to stretch the targetability window to legally target the initiating civilian so long as the CNA is underway, can the civilian limit his exposure in any way?\n\nA solution might be found in the American Law Institute’s Model Penal Code (“MPC”). The MPC defines criminal conspiracy as a person conspiring with another person or group of persons to commit a crime if the individual, with the purpose of promoting or facilitating the crime: 1) agrees with the other person or group that one or more of them will engage in conduct constituting a crime; or 2) agrees to aid the other person or group in planning or committing the crime.²⁶⁹ However, the actor may, after having conspired to commit a crime, use as an affirmative defense the fact that the actor thwarted the success of the conspiracy after having manifested a complete and voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.²⁷⁰ By renouncing his support for the crime and thwarting the success of the conspiracy, the actor is able to undo the effort he put into conspiring to commit the crime.\n\n²⁶⁷ Eva Knopova, *New IHL Framework for Cyber Warfare: Master’s Thesis*, CHARLES UNIV.

However, a party to an armed conflict abiding by LOAC would not be able to target a civilian who is no longer participating in hostilities.²⁷² Further, the civilian may take similar actions to renounce his participation and thwart further action by the code in an anonymous way.\n\nBy adopting this view, States who are a party to an armed conflict have better ground rules as to how to legally target non-state-affiliated civilians who are participating in cyber hostilities in a way that may not be covered by current IHL.²⁷³ Additionally, under this view, civilians will have a better understanding of how their actions, carried out as cyber operations, will be treated by States who are a party to an armed conflict. This view provides States and civilians with notice of how actions by civilians will be treated in cyberspace.

The civilian directly taking part in cyber hostilities, favoring a party to an armed conflict by conducting cyber operations against an opponent party, also exposes himself to domestic criminal law pertaining to the cyber operations. By coming forward, the civilian may be opening himself up to prosecution under domestic criminal law in an effort to prevent being directly targeted by the State against whom the civilian directly participated in hostilities.²⁷⁶ This may create a disincentive for civilians to expose themselves as ongoing direct participants in cyber hostilities, but the damage is already done.\n\nThe only question that remains is attribution. Can the attacked State determine who the civilian is for either direct targeting purposes or domestic criminal prosecution? If the civilian believes so, the civilian could limit his exposure to being directly attacked as well as request leniency from the domestic criminal prosecution for his cooperation.²⁷⁷ The alternative is for the civilian to figure out a way to completely remove every trace of his participation in an ongoing cyber operation, thereby ensuring the attacked State does not discover the cyber operation, attribute it to the civilian, and directly attack him.²⁷⁸\n\nWithout this possible outlet, civilians who have had a change of heart and no longer wish to participate in cyber hostilities may be targeted in the future for previous participation in cyber hostilities, of which they no longer wish to be a part. Though not a perfect method for keeping civilians safe from being directly targeted, this method provides notice to the attacking State of the civilian’s previous acts, which are the acts the civilian no longer wishes to be held accountable for in the realm of armed conflict.

State-affiliated civilians might engage in direct participation as part of their job; non-state-affiliated civilians might directly participate out of a sense of patriotism, helping the underdog, or feeling like part of the fight. Cyberspace creates an environment unlike any other ever seen before, so civilians and States who are a party to an armed conflict struggle to understand how LOAC principles apply to their conduct. A misunderstanding by a civilian could lead to a prolonged period of being directly targeted by a party to a conflict; a misunderstanding by that party could lead to allegations of war crimes. All sides to a conflict, to include civilians, would benefit from consensus in the application of LOAC to the cyber domain.\n\nA consensus in the application of LOAC principles in the cyber domain could lead to stronger footing for States and citizens as the cyberspace domain becomes a larger battleground. Cyberspace issues such as anonymity, attribution, temporal considerations, and equal application of force between the physical and cyber domains all highlight the need to better define LOAC applications to the cyber domain.²⁸⁰ Specifically, civilians should be able to renounce their direct participation in cyber hostilities, and they should no longer face direct targeting by a party to a conflict for cyber operations taken previously. The Tallinn Manual spells out that civilians may be directly targeted so long as their causal link to the action exists.²⁸¹ States subscribing to this view may link civilians to cyber operations carried out previously, even after civilians have walked away and no longer desire to directly participate.\n\nThe ability to target civilians for previous acts of cyber hostilities when States believe a causal link still exists may lead to an expanded window of time during which a civilian may be targeted. Thus, States who are party to a conflict should be able to know with certainty that the civilian they intend to target is a lawful target, due to the civilian’s ongoing intent to directly participate in hostilities. The renunciation clause found in the Model Penal Code could be the solution to ending\n\n²⁸⁰ Turns, supra note 62, at 281.\n²⁸¹ Id.",
    "2017 THE TARGETING OF NON-STATE-AFFILIATED CIVILIANS 1059\n\nmisunderstandings by civilians and parties to a conflict regarding direct participation and targeting.²⁸²\n\nUnder this view, civilians have a way to guarantee they will no longer be directly targeted for past cyber operations amounting to direct participation in hostilities when the State may not know the civilian’s participation has concluded. In addition, this view provides an out for States directly targeting civilians for directly participating in cyber hostilities against the State because the civilian has the opportunity and incentive to come clean if the civilian no longer wishes to directly participate. By coming forward, civilians may open themselves up to domestic prosecution, but they guarantee they will not be directly targeted by a State.\n\nA final point is examined by asking: should civilians have to go to such lengths to ensure they will not be directly targeted by a State for previous instances of direct participation in hostilities? Further, should LOAC require citizens to take active steps to put States on notice as to the citizens’ activities to prevent being illegally targeted after the direct participation in hostilities has concluded? An argument can be made that this policy would be requiring too much of civilians, and it exposes civilians to a lose-lose scenario.\n\nOn the one hand, civilians want to ensure the temporal anomalies in the cyber domain do not mislead States into falsely believing civilians are continuing to directly participate in hostilities after participation has ended. On the other, civilians want to protect against domestic prosecution and initiating an investigation into their activities. Though a possible solution to the issue of civilians being overly or illegally targeted could be found in the Model Penal Code, international law may not be willing to support the process or potential side effects to civilians providing notice to States that the civilians have withdrawn from the direct participation in hostilities.\n\n282 Id.",
