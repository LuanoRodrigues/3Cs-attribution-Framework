Introduction\n\nStates have become increasingly dependent on computers and the networks that connect them. The development of cyber space enables States and non-State actors to increase their offensive capabilities significantly¹. Cyber technology is now likely to become an essential offensive tool, in particular for terrorist organisations. It is even more the case that cyber attacks can be carried out more easily and with a lower risk of detection than attacks with conventional weapons: it is enough to have a computer and a connection to the internet. The concern that transnational terrorist or other non-State organisations may turn to cyber operations as a means of attacking States is well-founded. For instance, Al-Qaeda computers containing hacker tools have been seized and the membership of such a group has an increasing computer expertise². In his State of the Union Address of 2014, the President of the United States referred to the need to ‘...combat new threats like cyber attacks’³. A cyber attack can be defined as a deliberate action ‘...taken through the use of computer networks to disrupt, deceive, degrade, manipulate or destroy information resident in the target information system or computer networks, or the systems/networks themselves’⁴. Cyber attacks may produce effects that are not only internal to a\n\n¹The term ‘non-State actor’ refers to terrorist groups, rebel groups, other organised groups and individuals.\n²Michael N Schmitt, ‘Cyber Operations and the Jus Ad Bellum Revisited’ (2011-2012) 56 Villanova Law Review 569, 600.\n³<http: 01=\"\" 2014=\"\" 28=\"\" president-barack-obamas-state-union-address=\"\" the-press-office=\"\" www.whitehouse.gov=\"\"> accessed 1 December 2014.\n⁴<http: 2010-11-joint%20terminology%20for%20cyberspace%20operations.pdf=\"\" cyberreferencelib=\"\" www.nsci-va.org=\"\"> accessed 1 December 2014.\n\nElectronic copy available at: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2593868</http:></http:>",

Such would be the case for example when a computer network attack disables an air traffic control system and, thereby, causes an airliner to crash, resulting in material and physical destruction. In other words, a cyber operation may treat the target computer or computer network as the conduit for an attack on a physical target.\n\nTo what extent does international law on self-defence allow a State to react to cyber attacks? To implement the rules on the right to self-defence may entail certain difficulties in view of the specific characteristics of cyber technology. In particular, given the fast and anonymous character of a cyber attack, it may be difficult to attribute it to the author of that attack. Section II of this paper will outline the international criteria for the attribution of a cyber operation to a State. Section III will argue that only cyber attacks reaching the level of an armed attack give the right to the victim State to use self-defence. Section IV will explain that the law on self-defence does not offer an effective response to cyber attacks because, as international law stands, only cyber attacks attributed to States trigger the right to self-defence. Section V concludes that current international law on self-defence needs to be adapted to meet the challenges posed by cyber attacks.\n\n# 2. The Difficult Attribution of a Cyber Attack\n\nA crucial issue in any response in self-defence to a cyber attack is first to identify the author of the attack against whom action can be taken. Attribution is necessary for the effectiveness as well as for the lawfulness of the counter-action. International law does not know any specific standards of evidence with regard to issues involving the use of armed force in self-defence. There is, however, a general agreement that the graver the charge the more confidence there must be in the evidence⁵. Therefore, a State should determine with a high degree of confidence the identity of the author of a cyber attack before exercising its right to self-defence against it.\n\nThe author of a cyber attack may claim responsibility for it. For instance, a group that commits a cyber attack may claim credit for it in a message posted online or on a videotape given to the media. The style of a cyber attack may also help to identify the organisation responsible for it⁶. Otherwise, attribution of a cyber attack is a complicated exercise because of the nature of the cyber domain. Not only must the attack be traced back to its source, i.e. to a computer, but the person who operated the computer must also be identified or his affiliation determined. Unlike the case of an attacker in the physical world, a cyber attacker has the ability to launch an attack anonymously. In particular, in order to hide the real origin of an attack, cyber attackers may route\n\n⁵ Separate Opinion of Judge Higgins in Case Concerning Oil Platforms (Islamic Republic of Iran v United States of America) [2003] ICJ Rep, paras. 30-39.\n⁶ Susan W Brenner, ‘At Light Speed: Attribution and Response to Cybercrime/Terrorism/Warfare’ (2007) 97 Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology 379, 408.\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2593868",

To trace back an attack through those computers will require assistance from government and civilian entities in the States in which the computers were used. It can take months before assistance from the relevant States is obtained and the attack tracked back to its true point of origin⁸. A further issue in identifying the perpetrator of a cyber attack is caused by the volatility of electronic data, which may be altered, moved or deleted in seconds. Lastly, once the origin and the author of a damageable international cyber operation are known, it may be difficult to assess its real purpose. The cyber operation might not be hostile but attributable only to faulty software or to an accidental computer error or malfunction⁹. In April and May 2007, Estonia’s digital infrastructure was the victim of a massive computer network attack. Distributed ‘denial of service’ attacks targeted Estonia’s web services and brought Estonian web traffic to a halt. Since Estonia heavily relied on internet services, the impact of the cyber assault was very inconvenient. Most of the attacks emanated from abroad, principally Russia. It could not, however, be firmly demonstrated that the Russian government either conducted or orchestrated them. The origin of the attacks was also traced to at least 177 other States¹⁰. This example of cyber attacks from at least 178 countries shows how challenging it could be to attribute a cyber operation to its author. In order to be able to respond effectively to cyber attacks, States should continue their technically based effort to enhance the capacity to trace their source in real-time.\n\nIt is expected that most electronic attacks will be performed by non-State actors¹¹. They may also be committed by or on behalf of a State, as suspected of Russia. In that case, one would expect a State that commits a cyber attack to attempt to make it look like that of a hacker. Under international law, a cyber operation can be attributed to a State especially in the following four circumstances. The first is where a cyber act is performed by an organ of a State, for example a member of its armed forces. This conclusion does not change if the hacker is a civilian, non-military, organ of the State. In accordance with Article 4 of the 2001 Draft Articles of the International Law Commission that mostly codifies customary international law on the responsibility of States: ‘[t]he conduct of any State organ shall be considered an act of that State under international law, whether the organ exercises legislative, executive, judicial or any other functions...’¹². The second situation of attribution of a cyber act to a State is when the act is performed by a person or entity empowered by the State to exercise governmental authority¹³. For instance, if a State charges a private defence company with elements of authority normally associated with the government and asks it to conduct cyber operations, these operations will be imputed to the State. The third scenario in which a cyber operation may be attributed to a State is where the acting entity did so under the instructions, direction or control of a State. Such would be the case if a State hires an individual or an organisation to commit a cyber attack.

The degree of direction or control must be high, which means that the State should have effectively directed or controlled the specific cyber operation. The reality of the control exercised on the ground should be determined on a case-by-case basis¹⁵. It has been argued that the technical difficulty of attributing cyber attacks could only be responded to effectively by using a lower threshold for attribution¹⁶, namely the criterion of ‘overall control’ that covers the case where a State coordinates or helps in the general planning of the relevant operation¹⁷. Such an approach would, however, extend the use of the right to self-defence in response to cyber attacks in a dangerous manner and should be rejected. Finally, in accordance with Article 11 of the Draft Articles on the Responsibility of States: ‘[c]onduct ...shall...be considered an act of that State under international law if and to the extent that the State acknowledges and adopts the conduct in question as its own’¹⁸. In order to avoid counter-measures taken by the victim State, it is unlikely that a State will publicly acknowledge a cyber attack.\n\n# 3. The Qualification of a Cyber Attack as an Armed Attack\n\n## A. The Prohibition of Inter-State Armed Force\n\nArticle 2(4) of the UN Charter states: ‘All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations’. The mainstream view among States and international lawyers is that the ‘other manner’ language extends to any use of force not authorised by the Charter, even if it does not threaten the territorial integrity or the political independence of a State¹⁹. Since the expression ‘force’ in Article 2(4) is not preceded by the adjective ‘armed’, the scope of the ‘force’ to which Article 2(4) refers remains unclear and, in particular, whether it extends to economic or political force. The expression ‘armed force’ appears elsewhere in the Charter (in paragraph 7 of the Preamble to the Charter as well as in Articles 41 and 46). Furthermore, the first and principal purpose of the United Nations is, according to Article 1(1) of the Charter, to maintain international peace. Therefore, the interpretation of Article 2(4) in the context of the UN Charter is that it forbids the use of inter-State armed force by States parties. The preparatory work of the UN Charter confirms the fact that the prohibition contained in Article 2(4) is concerned only with military force²⁰. This conclusion is corroborated by resolutions of the UN General Assembly that deal with issues of\n\n¹⁴ Ibid.\n¹⁵ *Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v United States)*[1986]ICJ Rep 14, para. 115.\n¹⁶ Scott J Shackelford, ‘From Nuclear War to Net War: Analogising Cyber Attacks in International Law’ (2009) 27 Berkeley Journal of International Law 192, 235.\n¹⁷ *Prosecutor v Dusko Tadic* (15 July 1994) Judgment Appeals Chamber ICTY, IT-94-1-A, para. 131.\n¹⁸ *Official Records of the UN General Assembly* (n 12).\n¹⁹ Albrecht Randelzhofer and Oliver Dörr, ‘Article 2(4)’ in Bruno Simma (ed), *The Charter of the United Nations* (Vol. I, 2ⁿᵈ ed, OUP, 2012) 215-216.\n²⁰ *Documents of the United Nations Conference on International Organisation*, 1945, Vol. VI, 559 and 720.\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2593868",

International State practice also confirms a narrow scope of Article 2(4)²². In conclusion, the prohibition of the use of inter-State force in the UN Charter as well as in general public international law covers only armed force and not economic, political and other types of coercion, unless coupled with the use or at least the threat of armed force.\n\n## B. Is a Cyber Attack Armed Force?\n\nIs a cyber act equivalent to armed force prohibited by Article 2(4) of the UN Charter? This can be the case only if the act is committed by a State against another State. A cyber act of an individual or an entity that is not acting on behalf of a State is tried as criminal action even when the attacker acts from abroad and claims to be waging war against the victim State. Furthermore, in order to be covered by the prohibition of inter-State use of force, a cyber act must be similar to armed force. Neither the UN Charter nor the International Court of Justice provides a definition of ‘armed force’. ‘Armed’ can be defined as ‘[e]quipped with a weapon’ or ‘[i]nvolving the use of a weapon’²³. A weapon is ‘[a]n instrument used or designed to be used to injure or kill someone’²⁴. Or a weapon is ‘...a thing designed or used for inflicting bodily harm or physical damage’²⁵. In its Advisory Opinion on the Legality of the Use of Nuclear Weapons, the International Court of Justice stated that Article 2(4) of the UN Charter does ‘not refer to specific weapons’. It applies ‘...to any use of force, regardless of the weapons employed’²⁶. Therefore, should cyber technology be used to injure or kill, it should be regarded as a ‘weapon’.\n\nTwo main approaches can be adopted to determine whether a cyber attack constitutes ‘armed force’. The first approach is an ‘instrument-based’ one. Using this model, an assessment is made as to whether a cyber operation may intrinsically involve physical force like a conventional weapon. Physical force is traditionally understood as involving ‘...any explosive effect with shock waves and heat’²⁷. Cyber operations do not intrinsically imply such physical force and therefore the ‘instrument-based’ model does not fit them. The second approach is the ‘consequence-based’ approach. Here an assessment is made as to whether the overall effects of a computer network attack are equivalent to those of an attack using a traditional weapon. The ‘consequence-based’ approach regards as armed force the use of any new means that leads to serious destructive effects. It is more flexible than the ‘instrument-based’ approach and can adapt to the technical evolution of warfare. It allows the inclusion of certain cyber attacks in the notion of ‘armed force’ even if the drafters of the UN Charter did not think of this possibility in 1945 simply because it was then not technically possible. The ‘instrument-based’ approach has already been applied by Brownlie to biological and chemical devices. For him, when these agents are\n\n²¹ See in particular Declaration on Principles of International Law Concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation Among States in Accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, GA Res 2625 (24 October 1970), UN Doc A/Res/2625, Annex, para 1.\n²² Randelzhofer and Dörr (n 19) 209.\n²³ Bryan A Garner (ed), *Black’s Law Dictionary* (8th ed, St Paul Minn, Thomson West, 2009) 115.\n²⁴ Ibid, 1730.\n²⁵ *Oxford Dictionary of English* (2nd ed, OUP, 2008) 1994.\n²⁶ *Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons* (Advisory Opinion) [1996] ICJ Rep 226, para. 39.\n²⁷ Ian Brownlie, *International Law and the Use of Force by States* (Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1963) 362.\n\n[6]\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2593868",

Similarly, under the ‘consequence-based’ approach cyber operations may cause damage to tangible property, injury (including illness) or death. There are many examples of computer network attacks that should be considered as armed force: a cyber attack on the controlling system of air or train traffic, causing the crash of a plane or a train²⁹; a cyber operation creating a hammering phenomenon in oil pipelines causing them to burst; a cyber attack that shuts down power to a hospital with no back-up generators, or disrupts emergency response communications systems; a cyber attack that incapacitates the computers that control oil refineries, leading to the release of deadly effluents; a cyber operation shutting down computers controlling waterworks and dams, generating flooding of inhabited regions; a cyber attack disabling the systems that control a reactor of a nuclear power plant, leading to the release of radioactive materials. In these different situations, the severity of the consequences of the cyber operation - material destruction, injuries and/or deaths - rises to a level equal to that of an attack with kinetic weapons. By contrast, a cyber attack that interferes with the computers through which financial transactions are recorded and settled, and that disrupts a State’s financial system, would not constitute armed force because there is no destruction of objects or human injury³⁰. In the opinion of this author, qualifying such a cyber operation as a use of force would depart too much from the traditional definition of force and therefore also of an armed attack - an armed attack being a severe use of force³¹ - and would thus expand too much the use of the right to self-defence in response to an armed attack. Like this author, a majority of commentators use the ‘consequence-based’ model and conclude that cyber operations committed with the intention to cause material destruction, injuries and/or deaths analogous to those produced by kinetic weapons are to be considered as armed force³².\n\nThe appropriateness of the ‘consequence-based’ model is today confirmed by State views where several States regard cyber technology as a new form of warfare. By 2012, the 15 States with the biggest military budgets are all investing in offensive cyber capabilities³³. The United States, China, Iran, Israel and Russia have already introduced cyber technology into their military strategies and have established military units with specific cyber expertise³⁴.

In response to a UN General Assembly’s invitation to inform the UN Security Council on the States’ position regarding information security, the United Kingdom³⁵, Australia³⁶, the United States³⁷, and Iran³⁸ expressly stated that international law on the use of force applies. States did not yet categorise empirical cases of cyber attacks as constituting a use of force. In particular, since they did not lead to material damage or injury, the massive distributed ‘denial of service’ attacks that targeted Estonia’s web servers in 2007 or similar attacks that targeted Georgia’s websites when Russian forces invaded South Ossetia in 2008 were not qualified by States as uses of force³⁹. More surprisingly, no State considered as a use of force the attack caused by the Stuxnet virus that damaged Iran’s centrifuges for uranium enrichment in Natanz in 2010⁴⁰. The reason may be that this attack was unprecedented - the first computer operation that successfully targeted an industry and caused material destruction beyond the computer system itself. In any case, States increasingly acknowledge the possibility of a categorisation of severe cyber attacks as a use of force, and may react differently if a cyber attack with consequences as severe or more severe than those of the Stuxnet attack occurs in the future.\n\nSome commentators have advanced another and third approach for categorising when a cyber attack is to be considered as a use of force, namely the ‘target-based’ or ‘strict liability’ approach⁴¹. This approach treats any cyber attack against a critical national infrastructure as a use of force because of the possible severe effects if such an infrastructure is disabled. There are several issues with such an approach. First, there is no fixed international definition of the term ‘critical infrastructure’. States generally agree that critical infrastructures constitute services such as water distribution, health, energy, transportation, banking and finance⁴². However, as long as this term is not precisely defined by treaty law, States can transform and extend this enumerative list as they wish. Secondly, and most importantly, the ‘target-based’ approach is dangerously overbroad. Indeed, it assumes that any critical infrastructure network penetration reveals hostile intent and justifies the use of the right to self-defence, including anticipatory self-defence, whatever the level of damage finally caused⁴³. Third, this approach is not supported by States views.

Is a Cyber Attack a Grave Form of Armed Force?\n\nIn accordance with Article 51 of the UN Charter, ‘[n]othing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations...’. This provision is also a part of customary international law⁴⁴. The bedrock principle of self-defence is that it may be invoked in response to an armed attack. The question is then whether a cyber attack can constitute an armed attack, triggering the victim State’s right to respond through self-defence. In its Nicaragua judgment, the International Court of Justice referred to Article 3(g) of the ‘Definition of Aggression’ appended to a resolution of the UN General Assembly as concerning an ‘armed attack’⁴⁵. The Court reaffirmed this approach in its Armed Activities judgment⁴⁶. The Definition of Aggression can thus be used to define the concept of armed attack. Article 2 of the Definition states that aggression is ‘...the use of armed force by a State against the sovereignty, territorial integrity or political independence of another State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Charter of the United Nations’⁴⁷. Its Article 3 provides examples of aggression that are widely accepted by the international community. The list, however, deals only with conventional armed attacks involving the use of kinetic force. Article 2 of the Definition also specifies that an act of aggression must be of ‘sufficient gravity’. Similarly, the International Court of Justice has stated that the ‘most grave forms of the use of force’ constitute armed attacks, not ‘less grave forms’⁴⁸. Therefore not every use of armed force is necessarily deemed an armed attack. The scope, duration and intensity of the armed force must be assessed to determine whether an armed attack has occurred. The restriction of the implementation of self-defence to the use of serious armed force expresses the UN Charter’s intent to limit inter-State force. Furthermore, for the International Court of Justice, an armed attack must be carried out ‘...with the specific intention of harming’⁴⁹. If these statements are applied to cyber operations, it appears that an intentional disruption of digitised communications that causes only a minor destruction of physical property will reach the level of armed force but not that of an armed attack. By contrast, when a cyber operation is perpetrated with the intention of seriously destroying physical property and/or injuring or killing persons, that operation will qualify as an armed attack⁵⁰. For instance, if a computer attack causes a wagon of a goods train to crash, this may be considered as an illegal use of armed force but is unlikely to be regarded as an armed attack. On the contrary, a computer attack that leads to the crash of several passenger trains would very likely be considered as an armed attack.

It remains up to State practice to determine what level of damage is required to allow the legal use of self-defence. In this author’s opinion, only a limited number of cyber attacks, those causing severe material destruction, injury or death, should be considered as armed attacks. Without any doubt, the examples involving oil pipelines and refineries, dams, nuclear power plants and so on - which were cited above as uses of armed force - should also be regarded as armed attacks.\n\nIt should be noted that State practice seems to evolve towards the recognition of the ‘accumulation of effects’ doctrine, according to which the accumulation of several attacks from the same originator that do not on their own achieve the threshold of an armed attack constitute an armed attack in combination⁵². The United States and Israel in particular approve the ‘accumulation of effects’ theory⁵³. The International Court of Justice did not expressly pronounce on the matter, but equally seemed to have implicitly endorsed it⁵⁴. Such accumulation theory may, however, be abused in order to justify the recourse to force. It is argued that cyber attacks that do not reach the level of an armed attack individually can constitute an armed attack when aggregated only if they are related and only if they occur within a relative short period of time.\n\n# 4.

Could the State victim of a cyber attack exercise its right to self-defence against a non-State actor author of the attack? The International Court of Justice clearly stated that the Charter only ‘...recognises the existence of an inherent right of self-defence in the case of armed attack by one State against another State’⁵⁷. In another case, it declined to elaborate on whether actions by non-State actors would constitute an armed attack that would trigger an armed defense response⁵⁸. States, in particular the United States and Israel, have sometimes used force against non-State actors. After the defeat of the Taliban regime in November 2001, action in self-defence of the United States and its allies was no longer directed against the State of Afghanistan, but solely against the Al-Qaeda terrorist organisation and Taliban forces. The legality of this action was not, at least at the beginning, contested⁵⁹. In 2006 Israel took self-defence action against Hezbollah in Lebanon, declaring that it was acting not against the State of Lebanon -to which it was not able to attribute Hezbollah’s conduct - but against Hezbollah itself⁶⁰. Although many States criticised the disproportionate way in which Israel exercised its right to self-defence, they accepted that Israel enjoyed such a right in reaction to the attacks of Hezbollah⁶¹. When, in other precedents, States invoked the right to self-defence against non-State actors, in particular terrorist organisations, without showing any involvement of the State where they were based, third States were, however, reluctant to recognise the legality of the forcible action⁶². In recent State practice, there is no general and clear approval of the legality of the right to self-defence against non-State actors. Therefore it can be concluded that customary international law has not broadened, at least not yet, the right to self-defence to encompass action against non-State actors, authors of a cyber attack or not. Indeed, to recognise a right to self-defence against a non-State actor would be an infringement of the fundamental international principle of the territorial integrity of the State where the non-State actor is based. Furthermore, this could lead to a risk of abuse. States might engage in military operations against non-State actors although law enforcement through international organs would be the more normatively appropriate reaction.\n\n## B. Absence of a Right to Self-Defence Against States Actively Supporting Non-State Cyber Attackers\n\nThe right to self-defence can be carried out against a State that commits a cyber operation similar to an armed attack.

Article 3(g) of the Definition of Aggression qualifies as an act of aggression that can also be seen as a case of an armed attack the substantial involvement of a State in one of the acts of aggression referred to by Paragraphs b) to f) of Article 3⁶³. If a State provides financial, technical or other material support (below the level of direction and control) to an organisation and if this support significantly helps the commission by that organisation of a cyber attack whose level is equivalent to that of an armed attack and that is directed against another State, is the support of the State in the commission of the armed attack a ‘substantial involvement’ that corresponds to an armed attack? The International Court of Justice advocated a strict interpretation of ‘substantial involvement’ and held that ‘...assistance to rebels in the form of provision of weapons or logistical or other support’ does not fall into the category of armed attack⁶⁴. This legal position does not seem to have changed since⁶⁵. In current State practice, the supply of money, arms and logistical help has rarely been regarded as armed attack⁶⁶. However, even if it does not constitute an armed attack, such a supply is illegal and engages the responsibility of the State under international law. Indeed, a State is bound by an obligation not to actively support damageable conduct of non-State actors directed against another State⁶⁷. Concerning for instance activities of terrorist non-State actors, the UN Security Council has stressed that ‘...every Member State has the duty to refrain from organising, instigating, assisting or participating in terrorist acts in another State or acquiescing in organised activities within its territory directed toward the commission of such acts’⁶⁸.\n\nIn the opinion of this author, the law on self-defence should evolve in order to offer a more efficient response to international offensive cyber operations. The concept of ‘substantial involvement’ should be reinterpreted and include a lesser degree of State involvement than the one that seems to be required by the International Court of Justice. When a State provides practical assistance to an organisation for the purpose of assisting it with the commission of a computer network attack against another State - similar to an armed attack - and when this assistance substantially contributes to the commission of the attack, State practice should change in such a way that the State is regarded as having committed an armed attack itself⁶⁹. In such a situation, the victim State should have the right to self-defence against the relevant State.\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2593868\n\n⁶³ Definition of Aggression (n 47).\n⁶⁴ Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (n 15) para. 195.\n⁶⁵ The case law of the Nicaragua case was confirmed in Case Concerning Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo (n 46) paras. 106-147.\n⁶⁶ Gray (n 59) 132.\n⁶⁷ Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (n 15) para.205.\n⁶⁸ UNSC Res 1189 (1998) preamble, UN Doc S/RES/1189.\n⁶⁹ In his dissenting opinion to the Nicaragua case, Judge Schwebel found that the concept of ‘substantial involvement’ could also include financial and logistical support.

Absence of a Right to Self-Defence Against States Passively Supporting Non-State Cyber Attackers\n\nAnother question is whether a State that simply tolerates computer network attacks which are as severe as armed attacks and are mounted from within its territory or an area under its exclusive control against another State can be regarded as perpetrating an armed attack itself? This question was asked most famously in relation to non-cyber activities, those of 11 September 2001 against the United States mounted by the Al-Qaeda terrorist organisation from within Taliban-led Afghanistan. Afghanistan had harboured Al-Qaeda, and had not complied with UN Security Council resolutions asking it to stop doing so. It did not, however, control the 11 September attacks⁷⁰. These attacks were clearly similar in scale and effect to an armed attack. The United States (supported by allies, in particular the United Kingdom) began a military action against the Al-Qaeda organisation and also against the State of Afghanistan from 7 October 2001. Both the United States and the United Kingdom reported to the UN Security Council that the military intervention was taken in accordance with their right to individual self-defence and to collective self-defence respectively⁷¹. The UN Security Council recognised the existence of such a right to self-defence⁷². The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation and the Organisation of American States also invoked the right to self-defence to assist the United States in its response to the attacks. Overall, the military action in self-defence against Afghanistan received massive support from the international community⁷³. Considering the international approval of the military intervention in Afghanistan, can one conclude that self-defence can be invoked against a State tolerating non-State actors' activities that amount to an armed attack? The problem is that it is impossible to adduce conclusive State practice and *opinio juris* - both of which are necessary for the emergence of a customary international rule in support of this argument - other than that showed in the Afghanistan case of 2001⁷⁴. Therefore, it is not enshrined in current customary international law that self-defence can be implemented against a State tolerating the organisation of non-State actors' attacks, cyber or not, against another State from within its territory or an area under its exclusive control.\n\nThe tolerance by a State of the organisation of international attacks from within its territory is, however, illegal as will be shown in the following analysis. In accordance with the International Court of Justice in the Corfu Channel case of 1949, every State is under an obligation ‘...not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States’⁷⁵.

Concerning cyber attacks, the 2001 Resolution on Combating the Criminal Misuse of Information Technologies calls upon States to prevent their territories from being used as a safe haven from which to launch cyber attacks, and to cooperate in the investigation and prosecution of such attacks⁷⁷. It is now widely recognised that a State has a positive customary obligation of due diligence to prevent the commission of unlawful activities from within its territory or any area under its exclusive control against another State. In particular, a State should take necessary and reasonable measures to prevent non-State actors using its internet gateways to perpetrate computer network attacks against another State. A State must not knowingly permit its territory or any other space under its exclusive control to be used as a sanctuary for cyber actors bent on attacking targets in another country⁷⁸. When a State is unable to meet its obligation to prevent such action, either because it lacks the territorial control necessary to do so, or because it does not have the human or logistical resources available, it is under an obligation to seek assistance in preventing cyber attacks. If a State fails to seek such assistance, this should be interpreted as an unwillingness to meet its obligation to prevent cyber attacks against other States from its territory⁷⁹. The unwillingness of a State to perform its obligation to counter international offensive cyber operations does not trigger the right to self-defence of the victim State, but nevertheless does engage the international responsibility of the relevant State⁸⁰. For instance, if States were unable to attribute to Russia the cyber attacks against Estonia in 2007, but this State is nevertheless suspected of tolerating the private groups, as authors of the cyber attacks, that engages its international responsibility⁸¹.\n\nIn the opinion of this author, the law on self-defence should change. When a State infringes its obligation to prevent unlawful acts against another State committed on its territory or in an area under its exclusive control, and knowingly harbours a group preparing and perpetrating cyber attacks equivalent to armed attacks, this author argues that the State forfeits its right to territorial integrity. In this scenario, State practice should evolve so as to entitle the State victim of a cyber attack to use force in self-defence against the author of the cyber attack. The host State should, however, be given the opportunity to comply with its obligation to prevent international cyber offensives before there is a resort to action in self-defence. If international cyber attacks whose level is similar to that of armed attacks are prepared and committed from the territory of a failed State, then in this situation too, the victim State should have the right to self-defence against the cyber attackers. Indeed, if a State persists in not attempting to prevent cyber attacks equivalent to\n\n⁷⁶ Declaration on Principles of International Law Concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation Among States in Accordance with the Charter of the United Nations (n 21) para. 1.\n⁷⁷ GA Res 55/63 (22 January 2001), UN Doc A/RES/55/63, para. 1.\n⁷⁸ Jeffrey Carr, Inside Cyber Warfare: Mapping the Cyber Underworld (2ⁿᵈ ed, Sebastopol, O’Reilly, 2013) 62-67; David E Graham, ‘Cyber Threats and the Law of War’ (2010) 4 Journal of National Security Law and Policy 87, 93-94.\n⁷⁹ Kimberley N Trapp, ‘Back to Basics: Necessity, Proportionality and the Right of Self-Defence Against Non-State Terrorist Actors’ (2007) 56 ICLQ 147.\n⁸⁰ Ruys and Verhoeven (n 69) 306.

The requirement of the necessity of the use of the right to self-defence is thus fulfilled⁸².\n\nIn order to be more effective in response to international severe cyber attacks, a broader consensus in the international community should emerge towards the legality of the use of force in self-defence against cyber attackers committing cyber attacks equivalent to armed attacks and located in another State that does not prevent such attacks. The rationale behind this proposal is that the victim State should be entitled to engage in measures of prevention and suppression of cyber attacks which the host State should have performed itself. Therefore, the victim State should only target the cyber attackers and should not be allowed to react in self-defence against institutions of the host State⁸³. Furthermore, in the opinion of this author, the provision by a State of a safe haven to a cyber attacker is not serious enough so as to constitute an armed attack, even if the safe haven is necessary for, for example, planning and organising a cyber attack amounted to an armed attack. To argue otherwise would increase too much the possibility of resort to the use of force in self-defence⁸⁴.\n\nThe obligation of a State to prevent the perpetration by territorial actors of cyber attacks against other States, especially if they reach the level of armed attacks, is to be implemented with due diligence. It does not require the prevention of every international offensive cyber action but the adoption of reasonable measures in the light of the circumstances in order to generally prevent international cyber attacks. To assess whether a State respects its obligation of due diligence in the prevention of international cyber attacks, it should be checked: whether there has been a continuous pattern of cyber attacks from the relevant State; whether the State criminalises the commission of cyber attacks; whether the State conducts detailed investigations into cyber attacks; whether the State prosecutes cyber attackers; and whether the State cooperates with the victim States' investigations and prosecutions of the cyber attackers, especially when it lacks the capacity to investigate and prosecute those who have committed the cyber attacks⁸⁵. A careful assessment of all these facts is needed in order not to over stretch the limits of self-defence. Resort to self-defence should here be a last means to react to cyber attacks.\n\n⁸² Ashley S Deeks, “‘Unwilling or Unable’: Toward a Normative Framework for Extraterritorial Self-Defence” (2012) 52 Virginia Journal of International Law 483, 494; Trapp (n 79) 142.\n⁸³ Yoram Dinstein, War, Aggression and Self-Defence (4th ed, CUP, 2005) 245.\n⁸⁴ Sonja Cenic, ‘State Responsibility and Self-Defence in International Law Post 9/11: Has the Scope of Article 51 of the United Nations Charter Been Widened as a Result of the US Response to 9/11?’ (2007) 14 Australian International Law Journal 201, 214-215.\n⁸⁵ Graham (n 78)94.

Conclusion\n\nThe victim State of an international cyber attack could react within its right to self-defence if the cyber attack were attributable to a State and if the cyber attack had consequences similar to those of a traditional armed attack, namely severe material damage, human injury or human loss. Given the strict criteria governing the attribution of conduct to a State, most electronic attacks will not be attributable to a State. The current international right to self-defence does not, however, provide the State victim of a serious international computer network attack by a non-State actor with the legal possibility of reacting with force against that actor. Furthermore, it does not allow a reaction against a State that actively supports cyber attackers and provides financial, logistical or other support to them so that they are able to commit a cyber attack equivalent to an armed attack against another State. Finally, the current right to self-defence cannot be implemented against a State that harbours individuals or groups committing international cyber attacks from within its territory even if they amount to armed attacks. Therefore, the current international right to self-defence offers an incomplete and inadequate response to serious international cyber attacks.\n\nIn the opinion of this author, the law on self-defence should be amended and adapted to meet the distinctive challenges posed by severe international cyber attacks that are likely to be committed mostly by non-State actors. First, when a State provides practical assistance to a non-State organisation for the purpose of assisting it with the commission of a computer network attack against another State, similar to an armed attack, and when this assistance substantially contributes to the commission of the attack, State practice should change in such a way that the State is regarded as having committed an armed attack itself. In such a situation, the victim State should have the right to self-defence against the relevant State. Second, and this second scenario may occur more frequently than the first one, when a State knowingly harbours a non-State group preparing and perpetrating cyber attacks equivalent to armed attacks, it is here argued that it forfeits its right to territorial integrity. In this case, State practice should evolve so as to entitle the State victim of the cyber attacks to act in self-defence against the group - and only against it. In the exceptional situation when a cyber attack equivalent to an armed attack is committed against a State by a non-State actor based in the territory of a failed State, the victim State should also be allowed to implement its right to self-defence against the non-State actor. In all these circumstances, the action in self-defence could be traditional, and take a military form or cyber, and thus have effects similar to those of a forcible action in self-defence. The proposed changes in the implementation of the law to self-defence could occur through treaty law. However, it is unlikely that a majority of States will agree on a text governing reaction with force to cyber attacks in a near future, as there are fundamental differences between States on the interpretation on the international law on self-defence. It is therefore hoped that the proposed changes will emerge in customary international law through State practice.\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2593868",

Introduction\nStates have become increasingly dependent on computers and the networks that connect them. The development of cyber space enables States and non-State actors to increase their offensive capabilities significantly¹. Cyber technology is now likely to become an essential offensive tool, in particular for terrorist organisations. It is even more the case that cyber attacks can be carried out more easily and with a lower risk of detection than attacks with conventional weapons: it is enough to have a computer and a connection to the internet. The concern that transnational terrorist or other non-State organisations may turn to cyber operations as a means of attacking States is well-founded. For instance, Al-Qaeda computers containing hacker tools have been seized and the membership of such a group has an increasing computer expertise². In his State of the Union Address of 2014, the President of the United States referred to the need to ‘...combat new threats like cyber attacks’³. A cyber attack can be defined as a deliberate action ‘...taken through the use of computer networks to disrupt, deceive, degrade, manipulate or destroy information resident in the target information system or computer networks, or the systems/networks themselves’⁴. Cyber attacks may produce effects that are not only internal to a\n¹The term ‘non-State actor’ refers to terrorist groups, rebel groups, other organised groups and individuals.\n²Michael N Schmitt, ‘Cyber Operations and the Jus Ad Bellum Revisited’ (2011-2012) 56 Villanova Law Review 569, 600.\n³<http: 01=\"\" 2014=\"\" 28=\"\" president-barack-obamas-state-union-address=\"\" the-press-office=\"\" www.whitehouse.gov=\"\"> accessed 1 December 2014.\n⁴<http: 2010-11-joint%20terminology%20for%20cyberspace%20operations.pdf=\"\" cyberreferencelib=\"\" www.nsci-va.org=\"\"> accessed 1 December 2014.\nElectronic copy available at: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2593868</http:></http:>\nESIL CONFERENCE PAPER SERIES\n[VOL. 4 NO 16]\ncomputer or network but also external, by causing harm to connected facilities which could in turn lead to serious physical harm to property or individuals. Such would be the case for example when a computer network attack disables an air traffic control system and, thereby, causes an airliner to crash, resulting in material and physical destruction. In other words, a cyber operation may treat the target computer or computer network as the conduit for an attack on a physical target.\nTo what extent does international law on self-defence allow a State to react to cyber attacks? To implement the rules on the right to self-defence may entail certain difficulties in view of the specific characteristics of cyber technology. In particular, given the fast and anonymous character of a cyber attack, it may be difficult to attribute it to the author of that attack. Section II of this paper will outline the international criteria for the attribution of a cyber operation to a State. Section III will argue that only cyber attacks reaching the level of an armed attack give the right to the victim State to use self-defence. Section IV will explain that the law on self-defence does not offer an effective response to cyber attacks because, as international law stands, only cyber attacks attributed to States trigger the right to self-defence. Section V concludes that current international law on self-defence needs to be adapted to meet the challenges posed by cyber attacks.\n# 2. The Difficult Attribution of a Cyber Attack\nA crucial issue in any response in self-defence to a cyber attack is first to identify the author of the attack against whom action can be taken. Attribution is necessary for the effectiveness as well as for the lawfulness of the counter-action. International law does not know any specific standards of evidence with regard to issues involving the use of armed force in self-defence. There is, however, a general agreement that the graver the charge the more confidence there must be in the evidence⁵. Therefore, a State should determine with a high degree of confidence the identity of the author of a cyber attack before exercising its right to self-defence against it.\nThe author of a cyber attack may claim responsibility for it. For instance, a group that commits a cyber attack may claim credit for it in a message posted online or on a videotape given to the media. The style of a cyber attack may also help to identify the organisation responsible for it⁶. Otherwise, attribution of a cyber attack is a complicated exercise because of the nature of the cyber domain. Not only must the attack be traced back to its source, i.e. to a computer, but the person who operated the computer must also be identified or his affiliation determined. Unlike the case of an attacker in the physical world, a cyber attacker has the ability to launch an attack anonymously. In particular, in order to hide the real origin of an attack, cyber attackers may route\n⁵ Separate Opinion of Judge Higgins in Case Concerning Oil Platforms (Islamic Republic of Iran v United States of America) [2003] ICJ Rep, paras. 30-39.\n⁶ Susan W Brenner, ‘At Light Speed: Attribution and Response to Cybercrime/Terrorism/Warfare’ (2007) 97 Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology 379, 408.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2593868\nESIL CONFERENCE PAPER SERIES\n[VOL. 4 NO 16]\nan attack through a number of servers based around the globe prior to hitting the target system⁷. To trace back an attack through those computers will require assistance from government and civilian entities in the States in which the computers were used. It can take months before assistance from the relevant States is obtained and the attack tracked back to its true point of origin⁸. A further issue in identifying the perpetrator of a cyber attack is caused by the volatility of electronic data, which may be altered, moved or deleted in seconds. Lastly, once the origin and the author of a damageable international cyber operation are known, it may be difficult to assess its real purpose. The cyber operation might not be hostile but attributable only to faulty software or to an accidental computer error or malfunction⁹. In April and May 2007, Estonia’s digital infrastructure was the victim of a massive computer network attack. Distributed ‘denial of service’ attacks targeted Estonia’s web services and brought Estonian web traffic to a halt. Since Estonia heavily relied on internet services, the impact of the cyber assault was very inconvenient. Most of the attacks emanated from abroad, principally Russia. It could not, however, be firmly demonstrated that the Russian government either conducted or orchestrated them. The origin of the attacks was also traced to at least 177 other States¹⁰. This example of cyber attacks from at least 178 countries shows how challenging it could be to attribute a cyber operation to its author. In order to be able to respond effectively to cyber attacks, States should continue their technically based effort to enhance the capacity to trace their source in real-time.\nIt is expected that most electronic attacks will be performed by non-State actors¹¹. They may also be committed by or on behalf of a State, as suspected of Russia. In that case, one would expect a State that commits a cyber attack to attempt to make it look like that of a hacker. Under international law, a cyber operation can be attributed to a State especially in the following four circumstances. The first is where a cyber act is performed by an organ of a State, for example a member of its armed forces. This conclusion does not change if the hacker is a civilian, non-military, organ of the State. In accordance with Article 4 of the 2001 Draft Articles of the International Law Commission that mostly codifies customary international law on the responsibility of States: ‘[t]he conduct of any State organ shall be considered an act of that State under international law, whether the organ exercises legislative, executive, judicial or any other functions...’¹². The second situation of attribution of a cyber act to a State is when the act is performed by a person or entity empowered by the State to exercise governmental authority¹³. For instance, if a State charges a private defence company with elements of authority normally associated with the government and asks it to conduct cyber operations, these operations will be imputed to the State. The third scenario in which a cyber operation may be attributed to a State is where the acting entity did so under the instructions, direction or control of a State. Such would be the case if a State hires an individual or an organisation to commit a cyber attack. Article 8 of the Draft Articles on the Responsibility of States reads: ‘The conduct of a person or group of\n⁷Ibid, 409.\n⁸Ibid, 420.\n⁹Ibid, 434-435.\n¹⁰ Schmitt (n 2) 569-570.\n¹¹Jason Barkham, ‘Information Warfare and International Law on the Use of Force’(2001-2002) 34 NYU Journal of International Law and Politics 57, 58-59.\n¹²Official Records of the UN General Assembly, Fifty-Sixth Session, Supplement No. 10 (A/56/10), Chp.IVE.1.\n¹³Article 5 of the Draft Articles on the Responsibility of States, ibid.\n[4]\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2593868\nESIL CONFERENCE PAPER SERIES\n[VOL. 4 NO 16]\npersons shall be considered an act of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct¹⁴. The degree of direction or control must be high, which means that the State should have effectively directed or controlled the specific cyber operation. The reality of the control exercised on the ground should be determined on a case-by-case basis¹⁵. It has been argued that the technical difficulty of attributing cyber attacks could only be responded to effectively by using a lower threshold for attribution¹⁶, namely the criterion of ‘overall control’ that covers the case where a State coordinates or helps in the general planning of the relevant operation¹⁷. Such an approach would, however, extend the use of the right to self-defence in response to cyber attacks in a dangerous manner and should be rejected. Finally, in accordance with Article 11 of the Draft Articles on the Responsibility of States: ‘[c]onduct ...shall...be considered an act of that State under international law if and to the extent that the State acknowledges and adopts the conduct in question as its own’¹⁸. In order to avoid counter-measures taken by the victim State, it is unlikely that a State will publicly acknowledge a cyber attack.\n# 3. The Qualification of a Cyber Attack as an Armed Attack\n## A. The Prohibition of Inter-State Armed Force\nArticle 2(4) of the UN Charter states: ‘All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations’. The mainstream view among States and international lawyers is that the ‘other manner’ language extends to any use of force not authorised by the Charter, even if it does not threaten the territorial integrity or the political independence of a State¹⁹. Since the expression ‘force’ in Article 2(4) is not preceded by the adjective ‘armed’, the scope of the ‘force’ to which Article 2(4) refers remains unclear and, in particular, whether it extends to economic or political force. The expression ‘armed force’ appears elsewhere in the Charter (in paragraph 7 of the Preamble to the Charter as well as in Articles 41 and 46). Furthermore, the first and principal purpose of the United Nations is, according to Article 1(1) of the Charter, to maintain international peace. Therefore, the interpretation of Article 2(4) in the context of the UN Charter is that it forbids the use of inter-State armed force by States parties. The preparatory work of the UN Charter confirms the fact that the prohibition contained in Article 2(4) is concerned only with military force²⁰. This conclusion is corroborated by resolutions of the UN General Assembly that deal with issues of\n¹⁴ Ibid.\n¹⁵ *Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v United States)*[1986]ICJ Rep 14, para. 115.\n¹⁶ Scott J Shackelford, ‘From Nuclear War to Net War: Analogising Cyber Attacks in International Law’ (2009) 27 Berkeley Journal of International Law 192, 235.\n¹⁷ *Prosecutor v Dusko Tadic* (15 July 1994) Judgment Appeals Chamber ICTY, IT-94-1-A, para. 131.\n¹⁸ *Official Records of the UN General Assembly* (n 12).\n¹⁹ Albrecht Randelzhofer and Oliver Dörr, ‘Article 2(4)’ in Bruno Simma (ed), *The Charter of the United Nations* (Vol. I, 2ⁿᵈ ed, OUP, 2012) 215-216.\n²⁰ *Documents of the United Nations Conference on International Organisation*, 1945, Vol. VI, 559 and 720.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2593868\nESIL CONFERENCE PAPER SERIES\n[VOL. 4 NO 16]\npeace and security and which received the consent of a high majority of the States members of the Assembly²¹. International State practice also confirms a narrow scope of Article 2(4)²². In conclusion, the prohibition of the use of inter-State force in the UN Charter as well as in general public international law covers only armed force and not economic, political and other types of coercion, unless coupled with the use or at least the threat of armed force.\n## B. Is a Cyber Attack Armed Force?\nIs a cyber act equivalent to armed force prohibited by Article 2(4) of the UN Charter? This can be the case only if the act is committed by a State against another State. A cyber act of an individual or an entity that is not acting on behalf of a State is tried as criminal action even when the attacker acts from abroad and claims to be waging war against the victim State. Furthermore, in order to be covered by the prohibition of inter-State use of force, a cyber act must be similar to armed force. Neither the UN Charter nor the International Court of Justice provides a definition of ‘armed force’. ‘Armed’ can be defined as ‘[e]quipped with a weapon’ or ‘[i]nvolving the use of a weapon’²³. A weapon is ‘[a]n instrument used or designed to be used to injure or kill someone’²⁴. Or a weapon is ‘...a thing designed or used for inflicting bodily harm or physical damage’²⁵. In its Advisory Opinion on the Legality of the Use of Nuclear Weapons, the International Court of Justice stated that Article 2(4) of the UN Charter does ‘not refer to specific weapons’. It applies ‘...to any use of force, regardless of the weapons employed’²⁶. Therefore, should cyber technology be used to injure or kill, it should be regarded as a ‘weapon’.\nTwo main approaches can be adopted to determine whether a cyber attack constitutes ‘armed force’. The first approach is an ‘instrument-based’ one. Using this model, an assessment is made as to whether a cyber operation may intrinsically involve physical force like a conventional weapon. Physical force is traditionally understood as involving ‘...any explosive effect with shock waves and heat’²⁷. Cyber operations do not intrinsically imply such physical force and therefore the ‘instrument-based’ model does not fit them. The second approach is the ‘consequence-based’ approach. Here an assessment is made as to whether the overall effects of a computer network attack are equivalent to those of an attack using a traditional weapon. The ‘consequence-based’ approach regards as armed force the use of any new means that leads to serious destructive effects. It is more flexible than the ‘instrument-based’ approach and can adapt to the technical evolution of warfare. It allows the inclusion of certain cyber attacks in the notion of ‘armed force’ even if the drafters of the UN Charter did not think of this possibility in 1945 simply because it was then not technically possible. The ‘instrument-based’ approach has already been applied by Brownlie to biological and chemical devices. For him, when these agents are\n²¹ See in particular Declaration on Principles of International Law Concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation Among States in Accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, GA Res 2625 (24 October 1970), UN Doc A/Res/2625, Annex, para 1.\n²² Randelzhofer and Dörr (n 19) 209.\n²³ Bryan A Garner (ed), *Black’s Law Dictionary* (8th ed, St Paul Minn, Thomson West, 2009) 115.\n²⁴ Ibid, 1730.\n²⁵ *Oxford Dictionary of English* (2nd ed, OUP, 2008) 1994.\n²⁶ *Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons* (Advisory Opinion) [1996] ICJ Rep 226, para. 39.\n²⁷ Ian Brownlie, *International Law and the Use of Force by States* (Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1963) 362.\n[6]\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2593868\nESIL CONFERENCE PAPER SERIES\n[VOL. 4 NO 16]\ndirectly used to destroy physical property and life, they are weapons involving a use of armed force²⁸. Similarly, under the ‘consequence-based’ approach cyber operations may cause damage to tangible property, injury (including illness) or death. There are many examples of computer network attacks that should be considered as armed force: a cyber attack on the controlling system of air or train traffic, causing the crash of a plane or a train²⁹; a cyber operation creating a hammering phenomenon in oil pipelines causing them to burst; a cyber attack that shuts down power to a hospital with no back-up generators, or disrupts emergency response communications systems; a cyber attack that incapacitates the computers that control oil refineries, leading to the release of deadly effluents; a cyber operation shutting down computers controlling waterworks and dams, generating flooding of inhabited regions; a cyber attack disabling the systems that control a reactor of a nuclear power plant, leading to the release of radioactive materials. In these different situations, the severity of the consequences of the cyber operation - material destruction, injuries and/or deaths - rises to a level equal to that of an attack with kinetic weapons. By contrast, a cyber attack that interferes with the computers through which financial transactions are recorded and settled, and that disrupts a State’s financial system, would not constitute armed force because there is no destruction of objects or human injury³⁰. In the opinion of this author, qualifying such a cyber operation as a use of force would depart too much from the traditional definition of force and therefore also of an armed attack - an armed attack being a severe use of force³¹ - and would thus expand too much the use of the right to self-defence in response to an armed attack. Like this author, a majority of commentators use the ‘consequence-based’ model and conclude that cyber operations committed with the intention to cause material destruction, injuries and/or deaths analogous to those produced by kinetic weapons are to be considered as armed force³².\nThe appropriateness of the ‘consequence-based’ model is today confirmed by State views where several States regard cyber technology as a new form of warfare. By 2012, the 15 States with the biggest military budgets are all investing in offensive cyber capabilities³³. The United States, China, Iran, Israel and Russia have already introduced cyber technology into their military strategies and have established military units with specific cyber expertise³⁴.

In response to a UN General Assembly’s invitation to inform the UN Security Council on the States’ position regarding information security, the United Kingdom³⁵, Australia³⁶, the United States³⁷, and Iran³⁸ expressly stated that international law on the use of force applies. States did not yet categorise empirical cases of cyber attacks as constituting a use of force. In particular, since they did not lead to material damage or injury, the massive distributed ‘denial of service’ attacks that targeted Estonia’s web servers in 2007 or similar attacks that targeted Georgia’s websites when Russian forces invaded South Ossetia in 2008 were not qualified by States as uses of force³⁹. More surprisingly, no State considered as a use of force the attack caused by the Stuxnet virus that damaged Iran’s centrifuges for uranium enrichment in Natanz in 2010⁴⁰. The reason may be that this attack was unprecedented - the first computer operation that successfully targeted an industry and caused material destruction beyond the computer system itself. In any case, States increasingly acknowledge the possibility of a categorisation of severe cyber attacks as a use of force, and may react differently if a cyber attack with consequences as severe or more severe than those of the Stuxnet attack occurs in the future.\nSome commentators have advanced another and third approach for categorising when a cyber attack is to be considered as a use of force, namely the ‘target-based’ or ‘strict liability’ approach⁴¹. This approach treats any cyber attack against a critical national infrastructure as a use of force because of the possible severe effects if such an infrastructure is disabled. There are several issues with such an approach. First, there is no fixed international definition of the term ‘critical infrastructure’. States generally agree that critical infrastructures constitute services such as water distribution, health, energy, transportation, banking and finance⁴². However, as long as this term is not precisely defined by treaty law, States can transform and extend this enumerative list as they wish. Secondly, and most importantly, the ‘target-based’ approach is dangerously overbroad. Indeed, it assumes that any critical infrastructure network penetration reveals hostile intent and justifies the use of the right to self-defence, including anticipatory self-defence, whatever the level of damage finally caused⁴³. Third, this approach is not supported by States views. For all these reasons, the ‘target-based’ approach is to be rejected.\n³⁵ ‘Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunication in the Context of International Security’ (20 July 2010) UN Doc A/65/154, 15.\n³⁶ Ibid, 6.\n³⁷ Ibid, 18-19.\n³⁸ Ibid, 12.\n³⁹ Hathaway et al.

Is a Cyber Attack a Grave Form of Armed Force?\nIn accordance with Article 51 of the UN Charter, ‘[n]othing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations...’. This provision is also a part of customary international law⁴⁴. The bedrock principle of self-defence is that it may be invoked in response to an armed attack. The question is then whether a cyber attack can constitute an armed attack, triggering the victim State’s right to respond through self-defence. In its Nicaragua judgment, the International Court of Justice referred to Article 3(g) of the ‘Definition of Aggression’ appended to a resolution of the UN General Assembly as concerning an ‘armed attack’⁴⁵. The Court reaffirmed this approach in its Armed Activities judgment⁴⁶. The Definition of Aggression can thus be used to define the concept of armed attack. Article 2 of the Definition states that aggression is ‘...the use of armed force by a State against the sovereignty, territorial integrity or political independence of another State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Charter of the United Nations’⁴⁷. Its Article 3 provides examples of aggression that are widely accepted by the international community. The list, however, deals only with conventional armed attacks involving the use of kinetic force. Article 2 of the Definition also specifies that an act of aggression must be of ‘sufficient gravity’. Similarly, the International Court of Justice has stated that the ‘most grave forms of the use of force’ constitute armed attacks, not ‘less grave forms’⁴⁸. Therefore not every use of armed force is necessarily deemed an armed attack. The scope, duration and intensity of the armed force must be assessed to determine whether an armed attack has occurred. The restriction of the implementation of self-defence to the use of serious armed force expresses the UN Charter’s intent to limit inter-State force. Furthermore, for the International Court of Justice, an armed attack must be carried out ‘...with the specific intention of harming’⁴⁹. If these statements are applied to cyber operations, it appears that an intentional disruption of digitised communications that causes only a minor destruction of physical property will reach the level of armed force but not that of an armed attack. By contrast, when a cyber operation is perpetrated with the intention of seriously destroying physical property and/or injuring or killing persons, that operation will qualify as an armed attack⁵⁰. For instance, if a computer attack causes a wagon of a goods train to crash, this may be considered as an illegal use of armed force but is unlikely to be regarded as an armed attack. On the contrary, a computer attack that leads to the crash of several passenger trains would very likely be considered as an armed attack. The fact that a cyber attack may reach the\n⁴⁴ Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (n 15) para. 176.\n⁴⁵ Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (n 15) para. 195.\n⁴⁶ Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo (Democratic Republic of the Congo v Uganda) [2005] ICJ Rep 14, para. 146.\n⁴⁷ Definition of Aggression, GA Res 3314 (14 December 1974), UN Doc A/RES/3314.\n⁴⁸ Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (n 15) para. 191.\n⁴⁹ Case Concerning Oil Platforms (Islamic Republic of Iran v United States of America)[2003] ICJ Rep 161, para. 64.\n⁵⁰ Yoram Dinstein, ‘Computer Network Attacks and Self-Defence’ in Michael N Schmitt &amp; Brian T O’Donnell (eds), Computer Network Attack and International Law (Naval War College, International Law Studies, 2002) 105.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2593868\nESIL CONFERENCE PAPER SERIES\n[VOL. 4 NO 16]\nthreshold of an armed attack, triggering the right to self-defence, has been accepted by the heads of State and Government participating in the meeting of the North Atlantic Council in September 2014⁵¹. It remains up to State practice to determine what level of damage is required to allow the legal use of self-defence. In this author’s opinion, only a limited number of cyber attacks, those causing severe material destruction, injury or death, should be considered as armed attacks. Without any doubt, the examples involving oil pipelines and refineries, dams, nuclear power plants and so on - which were cited above as uses of armed force - should also be regarded as armed attacks.\nIt should be noted that State practice seems to evolve towards the recognition of the ‘accumulation of effects’ doctrine, according to which the accumulation of several attacks from the same originator that do not on their own achieve the threshold of an armed attack constitute an armed attack in combination⁵². The United States and Israel in particular approve the ‘accumulation of effects’ theory⁵³. The International Court of Justice did not expressly pronounce on the matter, but equally seemed to have implicitly endorsed it⁵⁴. Such accumulation theory may, however, be abused in order to justify the recourse to force. It is argued that cyber attacks that do not reach the level of an armed attack individually can constitute an armed attack when aggregated only if they are related and only if they occur within a relative short period of time.\n# 4. The Inappropriate Law on Self-defence in Response to Cyber Attacks\n## A. Absence of a Right to Self-Defence Against Non-State Cyber Attackers\nArticle 51 of the UN Charter does not expressly require that an armed attack be committed by a State in order to trigger the right to self-defence⁵⁵.

Could the State victim of a cyber attack exercise its right to self-defence against a non-State actor author of the attack? The International Court of Justice clearly stated that the Charter only ‘...recognises the existence of an inherent right of self-defence in the case of armed attack by one State against another State’⁵⁷. In another case, it declined to elaborate on whether actions by non-State actors would constitute an armed attack that would trigger an armed defense response⁵⁸. States, in particular the United States and Israel, have sometimes used force against non-State actors. After the defeat of the Taliban regime in November 2001, action in self-defence of the United States and its allies was no longer directed against the State of Afghanistan, but solely against the Al-Qaeda terrorist organisation and Taliban forces. The legality of this action was not, at least at the beginning, contested⁵⁹. In 2006 Israel took self-defence action against Hezbollah in Lebanon, declaring that it was acting not against the State of Lebanon -to which it was not able to attribute Hezbollah’s conduct - but against Hezbollah itself⁶⁰. Although many States criticised the disproportionate way in which Israel exercised its right to self-defence, they accepted that Israel enjoyed such a right in reaction to the attacks of Hezbollah⁶¹. When, in other precedents, States invoked the right to self-defence against non-State actors, in particular terrorist organisations, without showing any involvement of the State where they were based, third States were, however, reluctant to recognise the legality of the forcible action⁶². In recent State practice, there is no general and clear approval of the legality of the right to self-defence against non-State actors. Therefore it can be concluded that customary international law has not broadened, at least not yet, the right to self-defence to encompass action against non-State actors, authors of a cyber attack or not. Indeed, to recognise a right to self-defence against a non-State actor would be an infringement of the fundamental international principle of the territorial integrity of the State where the non-State actor is based. Furthermore, this could lead to a risk of abuse. States might engage in military operations against non-State actors although law enforcement through international organs would be the more normatively appropriate reaction.\n## B. Absence of a Right to Self-Defence Against States Actively Supporting Non-State Cyber Attackers\nThe right to self-defence can be carried out against a State that commits a cyber operation similar to an armed attack.

Article 3(g) of the Definition of Aggression qualifies as an act of aggression that can also be seen as a case of an armed attack the substantial involvement of a State in one of the acts of aggression referred to by Paragraphs b) to f) of Article 3⁶³. If a State provides financial, technical or other material support (below the level of direction and control) to an organisation and if this support significantly helps the commission by that organisation of a cyber attack whose level is equivalent to that of an armed attack and that is directed against another State, is the support of the State in the commission of the armed attack a ‘substantial involvement’ that corresponds to an armed attack? The International Court of Justice advocated a strict interpretation of ‘substantial involvement’ and held that ‘...assistance to rebels in the form of provision of weapons or logistical or other support’ does not fall into the category of armed attack⁶⁴. This legal position does not seem to have changed since⁶⁵. In current State practice, the supply of money, arms and logistical help has rarely been regarded as armed attack⁶⁶. However, even if it does not constitute an armed attack, such a supply is illegal and engages the responsibility of the State under international law. Indeed, a State is bound by an obligation not to actively support damageable conduct of non-State actors directed against another State⁶⁷. Concerning for instance activities of terrorist non-State actors, the UN Security Council has stressed that ‘...every Member State has the duty to refrain from organising, instigating, assisting or participating in terrorist acts in another State or acquiescing in organised activities within its territory directed toward the commission of such acts’⁶⁸.\nIn the opinion of this author, the law on self-defence should evolve in order to offer a more efficient response to international offensive cyber operations. The concept of ‘substantial involvement’ should be reinterpreted and include a lesser degree of State involvement than the one that seems to be required by the International Court of Justice. When a State provides practical assistance to an organisation for the purpose of assisting it with the commission of a computer network attack against another State - similar to an armed attack - and when this assistance substantially contributes to the commission of the attack, State practice should change in such a way that the State is regarded as having committed an armed attack itself⁶⁹. In such a situation, the victim State should have the right to self-defence against the relevant State.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2593868\n⁶³ Definition of Aggression (n 47).\n⁶⁴ Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (n 15) para. 195.\n⁶⁵ The case law of the Nicaragua case was confirmed in Case Concerning Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo (n 46) paras. 106-147.\n⁶⁶ Gray (n 59) 132.\n⁶⁷ Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (n 15) para.205.\n⁶⁸ UNSC Res 1189 (1998) preamble, UN Doc S/RES/1189.\n⁶⁹ In his dissenting opinion to the Nicaragua case, Judge Schwebel found that the concept of ‘substantial involvement’ could also include financial and logistical support.

Absence of a Right to Self-Defence Against States Passively Supporting Non-State Cyber Attackers\nAnother question is whether a State that simply tolerates computer network attacks which are as severe as armed attacks and are mounted from within its territory or an area under its exclusive control against another State can be regarded as perpetrating an armed attack itself? This question was asked most famously in relation to non-cyber activities, those of 11 September 2001 against the United States mounted by the Al-Qaeda terrorist organisation from within Taliban-led Afghanistan. Afghanistan had harboured Al-Qaeda, and had not complied with UN Security Council resolutions asking it to stop doing so. It did not, however, control the 11 September attacks⁷⁰. These attacks were clearly similar in scale and effect to an armed attack. The United States (supported by allies, in particular the United Kingdom) began a military action against the Al-Qaeda organisation and also against the State of Afghanistan from 7 October 2001. Both the United States and the United Kingdom reported to the UN Security Council that the military intervention was taken in accordance with their right to individual self-defence and to collective self-defence respectively⁷¹. The UN Security Council recognised the existence of such a right to self-defence⁷². The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation and the Organisation of American States also invoked the right to self-defence to assist the United States in its response to the attacks. Overall, the military action in self-defence against Afghanistan received massive support from the international community⁷³. Considering the international approval of the military intervention in Afghanistan, can one conclude that self-defence can be invoked against a State tolerating non-State actors' activities that amount to an armed attack? The problem is that it is impossible to adduce conclusive State practice and *opinio juris* - both of which are necessary for the emergence of a customary international rule in support of this argument - other than that showed in the Afghanistan case of 2001⁷⁴. Therefore, it is not enshrined in current customary international law that self-defence can be implemented against a State tolerating the organisation of non-State actors' attacks, cyber or not, against another State from within its territory or an area under its exclusive control.\nThe tolerance by a State of the organisation of international attacks from within its territory is, however, illegal as will be shown in the following analysis. In accordance with the International Court of Justice in the Corfu Channel case of 1949, every State is under an obligation ‘...not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States’⁷⁵. More specifically, the 1970 Declaration on Friendly Relations adopted by consensus by the UN General Assembly urges States to ‘...refrain from...acquiescing [in] organised activities within [their]\n⁷⁰ Gray (n 59) 200-201.\n⁷¹ Letters of the Permanent Representatives of the United States and of the United Kingdom to the United Nations, UN Docs S/2001/946 and S/2001/947 respectively.\n⁷² UNSC Res 1368 (2001) preamble, UN Doc S/RES/1368 and UNSC Res 1373 (2001) preamble, UN Doc S/RES/1373.\n⁷³ Gray (n 59) 193-194.\n⁷⁴ Gray (n 59) 136-140 and 230-231; Olivier Corten, *The Law Against War* (Oregon, Hart Publishing, 2002) 183-186.\n⁷⁵ The Corfu Channel Case (United Kingdom v Albania) [1949] ICJ Rep 4, 22.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2593868\nESIL CONFERENCE PAPER SERIES\n[VOL. 4 NO 16]\nterritory directed towards the commission of [civil strife or terrorism in another State]⁷⁶. Concerning cyber attacks, the 2001 Resolution on Combating the Criminal Misuse of Information Technologies calls upon States to prevent their territories from being used as a safe haven from which to launch cyber attacks, and to cooperate in the investigation and prosecution of such attacks⁷⁷. It is now widely recognised that a State has a positive customary obligation of due diligence to prevent the commission of unlawful activities from within its territory or any area under its exclusive control against another State. In particular, a State should take necessary and reasonable measures to prevent non-State actors using its internet gateways to perpetrate computer network attacks against another State. A State must not knowingly permit its territory or any other space under its exclusive control to be used as a sanctuary for cyber actors bent on attacking targets in another country⁷⁸. When a State is unable to meet its obligation to prevent such action, either because it lacks the territorial control necessary to do so, or because it does not have the human or logistical resources available, it is under an obligation to seek assistance in preventing cyber attacks. If a State fails to seek such assistance, this should be interpreted as an unwillingness to meet its obligation to prevent cyber attacks against other States from its territory⁷⁹. The unwillingness of a State to perform its obligation to counter international offensive cyber operations does not trigger the right to self-defence of the victim State, but nevertheless does engage the international responsibility of the relevant State⁸⁰. For instance, if States were unable to attribute to Russia the cyber attacks against Estonia in 2007, but this State is nevertheless suspected of tolerating the private groups, as authors of the cyber attacks, that engages its international responsibility⁸¹.\nIn the opinion of this author, the law on self-defence should change. When a State infringes its obligation to prevent unlawful acts against another State committed on its territory or in an area under its exclusive control, and knowingly harbours a group preparing and perpetrating cyber attacks equivalent to armed attacks, this author argues that the State forfeits its right to territorial integrity. In this scenario, State practice should evolve so as to entitle the State victim of a cyber attack to use force in self-defence against the author of the cyber attack. The host State should, however, be given the opportunity to comply with its obligation to prevent international cyber offensives before there is a resort to action in self-defence. If international cyber attacks whose level is similar to that of armed attacks are prepared and committed from the territory of a failed State, then in this situation too, the victim State should have the right to self-defence against the cyber attackers. Indeed, if a State persists in not attempting to prevent cyber attacks equivalent to\n⁷⁶ Declaration on Principles of International Law Concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation Among States in Accordance with the Charter of the United Nations (n 21) para. 1.\n⁷⁷ GA Res 55/63 (22 January 2001), UN Doc A/RES/55/63, para. 1.\n⁷⁸ Jeffrey Carr, Inside Cyber Warfare: Mapping the Cyber Underworld (2ⁿᵈ ed, Sebastopol, O’Reilly, 2013) 62-67; David E Graham, ‘Cyber Threats and the Law of War’ (2010) 4 Journal of National Security Law and Policy 87, 93-94.\n⁷⁹ Kimberley N Trapp, ‘Back to Basics: Necessity, Proportionality and the Right of Self-Defence Against Non-State Terrorist Actors’ (2007) 56 ICLQ 147.\n⁸⁰ Ruys and Verhoeven (n 69) 306.

The requirement of the necessity of the use of the right to self-defence is thus fulfilled⁸².\nIn order to be more effective in response to international severe cyber attacks, a broader consensus in the international community should emerge towards the legality of the use of force in self-defence against cyber attackers committing cyber attacks equivalent to armed attacks and located in another State that does not prevent such attacks. The rationale behind this proposal is that the victim State should be entitled to engage in measures of prevention and suppression of cyber attacks which the host State should have performed itself. Therefore, the victim State should only target the cyber attackers and should not be allowed to react in self-defence against institutions of the host State⁸³. Furthermore, in the opinion of this author, the provision by a State of a safe haven to a cyber attacker is not serious enough so as to constitute an armed attack, even if the safe haven is necessary for, for example, planning and organising a cyber attack amounted to an armed attack. To argue otherwise would increase too much the possibility of resort to the use of force in self-defence⁸⁴.\nThe obligation of a State to prevent the perpetration by territorial actors of cyber attacks against other States, especially if they reach the level of armed attacks, is to be implemented with due diligence. It does not require the prevention of every international offensive cyber action but the adoption of reasonable measures in the light of the circumstances in order to generally prevent international cyber attacks. To assess whether a State respects its obligation of due diligence in the prevention of international cyber attacks, it should be checked: whether there has been a continuous pattern of cyber attacks from the relevant State; whether the State criminalises the commission of cyber attacks; whether the State conducts detailed investigations into cyber attacks; whether the State prosecutes cyber attackers; and whether the State cooperates with the victim States' investigations and prosecutions of the cyber attackers, especially when it lacks the capacity to investigate and prosecute those who have committed the cyber attacks⁸⁵. A careful assessment of all these facts is needed in order not to over stretch the limits of self-defence. Resort to self-defence should here be a last means to react to cyber attacks.\n⁸² Ashley S Deeks, “‘Unwilling or Unable’: Toward a Normative Framework for Extraterritorial Self-Defence” (2012) 52 Virginia Journal of International Law 483, 494; Trapp (n 79) 142.\n⁸³ Yoram Dinstein, War, Aggression and Self-Defence (4th ed, CUP, 2005) 245.\n⁸⁴ Sonja Cenic, ‘State Responsibility and Self-Defence in International Law Post 9/11: Has the Scope of Article 51 of the United Nations Charter Been Widened as a Result of the US Response to 9/11?’ (2007) 14 Australian International Law Journal 201, 214-215.\n⁸⁵ Graham (n 78)94.

Conclusion\nThe victim State of an international cyber attack could react within its right to self-defence if the cyber attack were attributable to a State and if the cyber attack had consequences similar to those of a traditional armed attack, namely severe material damage, human injury or human loss. Given the strict criteria governing the attribution of conduct to a State, most electronic attacks will not be attributable to a State. The current international right to self-defence does not, however, provide the State victim of a serious international computer network attack by a non-State actor with the legal possibility of reacting with force against that actor. Furthermore, it does not allow a reaction against a State that actively supports cyber attackers and provides financial, logistical or other support to them so that they are able to commit a cyber attack equivalent to an armed attack against another State. Finally, the current right to self-defence cannot be implemented against a State that harbours individuals or groups committing international cyber attacks from within its territory even if they amount to armed attacks. Therefore, the current international right to self-defence offers an incomplete and inadequate response to serious international cyber attacks.\nIn the opinion of this author, the law on self-defence should be amended and adapted to meet the distinctive challenges posed by severe international cyber attacks that are likely to be committed mostly by non-State actors. First, when a State provides practical assistance to a non-State organisation for the purpose of assisting it with the commission of a computer network attack against another State, similar to an armed attack, and when this assistance substantially contributes to the commission of the attack, State practice should change in such a way that the State is regarded as having committed an armed attack itself. In such a situation, the victim State should have the right to self-defence against the relevant State. Second, and this second scenario may occur more frequently than the first one, when a State knowingly harbours a non-State group preparing and perpetrating cyber attacks equivalent to armed attacks, it is here argued that it forfeits its right to territorial integrity. In this case, State practice should evolve so as to entitle the State victim of the cyber attacks to act in self-defence against the group - and only against it. In the exceptional situation when a cyber attack equivalent to an armed attack is committed against a State by a non-State actor based in the territory of a failed State, the victim State should also be allowed to implement its right to self-defence against the non-State actor. In all these circumstances, the action in self-defence could be traditional, and take a military form or cyber, and thus have effects similar to those of a forcible action in self-defence. The proposed changes in the implementation of the law to self-defence could occur through treaty law. However, it is unlikely that a majority of States will agree on a text governing reaction with force to cyber attacks in a near future, as there are fundamental differences between States on the interpretation on the international law on self-defence. It is therefore hoped that the proposed changes will emerge in customary international law through State practice.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2593868",

Introduction\nStates have become increasingly dependent on computers and the networks that connect them. The development of cyber space enables States and non-State actors to increase their offensive capabilities significantly. Cyber technology is now likely to become an essential offensive tool, in particular for terrorist organisations. It is even more the case that cyber attacks can be carried out more easily and with a lower risk of detection than attacks with conventional weapons: it is enough to have a computer and a connection to the internet. The concern that transnational terrorist or other non-State organisations may turn to cyber operations as a means of attacking States is well-founded. For instance, Al-Qaeda computers containing hacker tools have been seized and the membership of such a group has an increasing computer expertise. In his State of the Union Address of 2014, the President of the United States referred to the need to ‘...combat new threats like cyber attacks’. A cyber attack can be defined as a deliberate action ‘...taken through the use of computer networks to disrupt, deceive, degrade, manipulate or destroy information resident in the target information system or computer networks, or the systems/networks themselves’. Cyber attacks may produce effects that are not only internal to a\nThe term ‘non-State actor’ refers to terrorist groups, rebel groups, other organised groups and individuals.\nMichael N Schmitt, ‘Cyber Operations and the Jus Ad Bellum Revisited’ (2011-2012) 56 Villanova Law Review 569, 600.\n<http: 01=\"\" 2014=\"\" 28=\"\" president-barack-obamas-state-union-address=\"\" the-press-office=\"\" www.whitehouse.gov=\"\"> accessed 1 December 2014.\n<http: 2010-11-joint%20terminology%20for%20cyberspace%20operations.pdf=\"\" cyberreferencelib=\"\" www.nsci-va.org=\"\"> accessed 1 December 2014.\nElectronic copy available at: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2593868</http:></http:>\nESIL CONFERENCE PAPER SERIES\n[VOL. 4 NO 16]\ncomputer or network but also external, by causing harm to connected facilities which could in turn lead to serious physical harm to property or individuals. Such would be the case for example when a computer network attack disables an air traffic control system and, thereby, causes an airliner to crash, resulting in material and physical destruction. In other words, a cyber operation may treat the target computer or computer network as the conduit for an attack on a physical target.\nTo what extent does international law on self-defence allow a State to react to cyber attacks? To implement the rules on the right to self-defence may entail certain difficulties in view of the specific characteristics of cyber technology. In particular, given the fast and anonymous character of a cyber attack, it may be difficult to attribute it to the author of that attack. Section II of this paper will outline the international criteria for the attribution of a cyber operation to a State. Section III will argue that only cyber attacks reaching the level of an armed attack give the right to the victim State to use self-defence. Section IV will explain that the law on self-defence does not offer an effective response to cyber attacks because, as international law stands, only cyber attacks attributed to States trigger the right to self-defence. Section V concludes that current international law on self-defence needs to be adapted to meet the challenges posed by cyber attacks.\n# 2. The Difficult Attribution of a Cyber Attack\nA crucial issue in any response in self-defence to a cyber attack is first to identify the author of the attack against whom action can be taken. Attribution is necessary for the effectiveness as well as for the lawfulness of the counter-action. International law does not know any specific standards of evidence with regard to issues involving the use of armed force in self-defence. There is, however, a general agreement that the graver the charge the more confidence there must be in the evidence. Therefore, a State should determine with a high degree of confidence the identity of the author of a cyber attack before exercising its right to self-defence against it.\nThe author of a cyber attack may claim responsibility for it. For instance, a group that commits a cyber attack may claim credit for it in a message posted online or on a videotape given to the media. The style of a cyber attack may also help to identify the organisation responsible for it. Otherwise, attribution of a cyber attack is a complicated exercise because of the nature of the cyber domain. Not only must the attack be traced back to its source, i.e. to a computer, but the person who operated the computer must also be identified or his affiliation determined. Unlike the case of an attacker in the physical world, a cyber attacker has the ability to launch an attack anonymously. In particular, in order to hide the real origin of an attack, cyber attackers may route\n Separate Opinion of Judge Higgins in Case Concerning Oil Platforms (Islamic Republic of Iran v United States of America) [2003] ICJ Rep, paras. 30-39.\n Susan W Brenner, ‘At Light Speed: Attribution and Response to Cybercrime/Terrorism/Warfare’ (2007) 97 Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology 379, 408.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2593868\nESIL CONFERENCE PAPER SERIES\n[VOL. 4 NO 16]\nan attack through a number of servers based around the globe prior to hitting the target system. To trace back an attack through those computers will require assistance from government and civilian entities in the States in which the computers were used. It can take months before assistance from the relevant States is obtained and the attack tracked back to its true point of origin. A further issue in identifying the perpetrator of a cyber attack is caused by the volatility of electronic data, which may be altered, moved or deleted in seconds. Lastly, once the origin and the author of a damageable international cyber operation are known, it may be difficult to assess its real purpose. The cyber operation might not be hostile but attributable only to faulty software or to an accidental computer error or malfunction. In April and May 2007, Estonia’s digital infrastructure was the victim of a massive computer network attack. Distributed ‘denial of service’ attacks targeted Estonia’s web services and brought Estonian web traffic to a halt. Since Estonia heavily relied on internet services, the impact of the cyber assault was very inconvenient. Most of the attacks emanated from abroad, principally Russia. It could not, however, be firmly demonstrated that the Russian government either conducted or orchestrated them. The origin of the attacks was also traced to at least 177 other States. This example of cyber attacks from at least 178 countries shows how challenging it could be to attribute a cyber operation to its author. In order to be able to respond effectively to cyber attacks, States should continue their technically based effort to enhance the capacity to trace their source in real-time.\nIt is expected that most electronic attacks will be performed by non-State actors. They may also be committed by or on behalf of a State, as suspected of Russia. In that case, one would expect a State that commits a cyber attack to attempt to make it look like that of a hacker. Under international law, a cyber operation can be attributed to a State especially in the following four circumstances. The first is where a cyber act is performed by an organ of a State, for example a member of its armed forces. This conclusion does not change if the hacker is a civilian, non-military, organ of the State. In accordance with Article 4 of the 2001 Draft Articles of the International Law Commission that mostly codifies customary international law on the responsibility of States: ‘[t]he conduct of any State organ shall be considered an act of that State under international law, whether the organ exercises legislative, executive, judicial or any other functions...’. The second situation of attribution of a cyber act to a State is when the act is performed by a person or entity empowered by the State to exercise governmental authority. For instance, if a State charges a private defence company with elements of authority normally associated with the government and asks it to conduct cyber operations, these operations will be imputed to the State. The third scenario in which a cyber operation may be attributed to a State is where the acting entity did so under the instructions, direction or control of a State. Such would be the case if a State hires an individual or an organisation to commit a cyber attack. Article 8 of the Draft Articles on the Responsibility of States reads: ‘The conduct of a person or group of\nIbid, 409.\nIbid, 420.\nIbid, 434-435.\n Schmitt (n 2) 569-570.\nJason Barkham, ‘Information Warfare and International Law on the Use of Force’(2001-2002) 34 NYU Journal of International Law and Politics 57, 58-59.\nOfficial Records of the UN General Assembly, Fifty-Sixth Session, Supplement No. 10 (A/56/10), Chp.IVE.1.\nArticle 5 of the Draft Articles on the Responsibility of States, ibid.\n[4]\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2593868\nESIL CONFERENCE PAPER SERIES\n[VOL. 4 NO 16]\npersons shall be considered an act of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct. The degree of direction or control must be high, which means that the State should have effectively directed or controlled the specific cyber operation. The reality of the control exercised on the ground should be determined on a case-by-case basis. It has been argued that the technical difficulty of attributing cyber attacks could only be responded to effectively by using a lower threshold for attribution, namely the criterion of ‘overall control’ that covers the case where a State coordinates or helps in the general planning of the relevant operation. Such an approach would, however, extend the use of the right to self-defence in response to cyber attacks in a dangerous manner and should be rejected. Finally, in accordance with Article 11 of the Draft Articles on the Responsibility of States: ‘[c]onduct ...shall...be considered an act of that State under international law if and to the extent that the State acknowledges and adopts the conduct in question as its own’. In order to avoid counter-measures taken by the victim State, it is unlikely that a State will publicly acknowledge a cyber attack.\n# 3. The Qualification of a Cyber Attack as an Armed Attack\n## A. The Prohibition of Inter-State Armed Force\nArticle 2(4) of the UN Charter states: ‘All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations’. The mainstream view among States and international lawyers is that the ‘other manner’ language extends to any use of force not authorised by the Charter, even if it does not threaten the territorial integrity or the political independence of a State. Since the expression ‘force’ in Article 2(4) is not preceded by the adjective ‘armed’, the scope of the ‘force’ to which Article 2(4) refers remains unclear and, in particular, whether it extends to economic or political force. The expression ‘armed force’ appears elsewhere in the Charter (in paragraph 7 of the Preamble to the Charter as well as in Articles 41 and 46). Furthermore, the first and principal purpose of the United Nations is, according to Article 1(1) of the Charter, to maintain international peace. Therefore, the interpretation of Article 2(4) in the context of the UN Charter is that it forbids the use of inter-State armed force by States parties. The preparatory work of the UN Charter confirms the fact that the prohibition contained in Article 2(4) is concerned only with military force. This conclusion is corroborated by resolutions of the UN General Assembly that deal with issues of\n Ibid.\n *Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v United States)*[1986]ICJ Rep 14, para. 115.\n Scott J Shackelford, ‘From Nuclear War to Net War: Analogising Cyber Attacks in International Law’ (2009) 27 Berkeley Journal of International Law 192, 235.\n *Prosecutor v Dusko Tadic* (15 July 1994) Judgment Appeals Chamber ICTY, IT-94-1-A, para. 131.\n *Official Records of the UN General Assembly* (n 12).\n Albrecht Randelzhofer and Oliver Dörr, ‘Article 2(4)’ in Bruno Simma (ed), *The Charter of the United Nations* (Vol. I, 2ⁿᵈ ed, OUP, 2012) 215-216.\n *Documents of the United Nations Conference on International Organisation*, 1945, Vol. VI, 559 and 720.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2593868\nESIL CONFERENCE PAPER SERIES\n[VOL. 4 NO 16]\npeace and security and which received the consent of a high majority of the States members of the Assembly. International State practice also confirms a narrow scope of Article 2(4). In conclusion, the prohibition of the use of inter-State force in the UN Charter as well as in general public international law covers only armed force and not economic, political and other types of coercion, unless coupled with the use or at least the threat of armed force.\n## B. Is a Cyber Attack Armed Force?\nIs a cyber act equivalent to armed force prohibited by Article 2(4) of the UN Charter? This can be the case only if the act is committed by a State against another State. A cyber act of an individual or an entity that is not acting on behalf of a State is tried as criminal action even when the attacker acts from abroad and claims to be waging war against the victim State. Furthermore, in order to be covered by the prohibition of inter-State use of force, a cyber act must be similar to armed force. Neither the UN Charter nor the International Court of Justice provides a definition of ‘armed force’. ‘Armed’ can be defined as ‘[e]quipped with a weapon’ or ‘[i]nvolving the use of a weapon’. A weapon is ‘[a]n instrument used or designed to be used to injure or kill someone’. Or a weapon is ‘...a thing designed or used for inflicting bodily harm or physical damage’. In its Advisory Opinion on the Legality of the Use of Nuclear Weapons, the International Court of Justice stated that Article 2(4) of the UN Charter does ‘not refer to specific weapons’. It applies ‘...to any use of force, regardless of the weapons employed’. Therefore, should cyber technology be used to injure or kill, it should be regarded as a ‘weapon’.\nTwo main approaches can be adopted to determine whether a cyber attack constitutes ‘armed force’. The first approach is an ‘instrument-based’ one. Using this model, an assessment is made as to whether a cyber operation may intrinsically involve physical force like a conventional weapon. Physical force is traditionally understood as involving ‘...any explosive effect with shock waves and heat’. Cyber operations do not intrinsically imply such physical force and therefore the ‘instrument-based’ model does not fit them. The second approach is the ‘consequence-based’ approach. Here an assessment is made as to whether the overall effects of a computer network attack are equivalent to those of an attack using a traditional weapon. The ‘consequence-based’ approach regards as armed force the use of any new means that leads to serious destructive effects. It is more flexible than the ‘instrument-based’ approach and can adapt to the technical evolution of warfare. It allows the inclusion of certain cyber attacks in the notion of ‘armed force’ even if the drafters of the UN Charter did not think of this possibility in 1945 simply because it was then not technically possible. The ‘instrument-based’ approach has already been applied by Brownlie to biological and chemical devices. For him, when these agents are\n See in particular Declaration on Principles of International Law Concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation Among States in Accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, GA Res 2625 (24 October 1970), UN Doc A/Res/2625, Annex, para 1.\n Randelzhofer and Dörr (n 19) 209.\n Bryan A Garner (ed), *Black’s Law Dictionary* (8th ed, St Paul Minn, Thomson West, 2009) 115.\n Ibid, 1730.\n *Oxford Dictionary of English* (2nd ed, OUP, 2008) 1994.\n *Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons* (Advisory Opinion) [1996] ICJ Rep 226, para. 39.\n Ian Brownlie, *International Law and the Use of Force by States* (Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1963) 362.\n[6]\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2593868\nESIL CONFERENCE PAPER SERIES\n[VOL. 4 NO 16]\ndirectly used to destroy physical property and life, they are weapons involving a use of armed force. Similarly, under the ‘consequence-based’ approach cyber operations may cause damage to tangible property, injury (including illness) or death. There are many examples of computer network attacks that should be considered as armed force: a cyber attack on the controlling system of air or train traffic, causing the crash of a plane or a train; a cyber operation creating a hammering phenomenon in oil pipelines causing them to burst; a cyber attack that shuts down power to a hospital with no back-up generators, or disrupts emergency response communications systems; a cyber attack that incapacitates the computers that control oil refineries, leading to the release of deadly effluents; a cyber operation shutting down computers controlling waterworks and dams, generating flooding of inhabited regions; a cyber attack disabling the systems that control a reactor of a nuclear power plant, leading to the release of radioactive materials. In these different situations, the severity of the consequences of the cyber operation - material destruction, injuries and/or deaths - rises to a level equal to that of an attack with kinetic weapons. By contrast, a cyber attack that interferes with the computers through which financial transactions are recorded and settled, and that disrupts a State’s financial system, would not constitute armed force because there is no destruction of objects or human injury. In the opinion of this author, qualifying such a cyber operation as a use of force would depart too much from the traditional definition of force and therefore also of an armed attack - an armed attack being a severe use of force - and would thus expand too much the use of the right to self-defence in response to an armed attack. Like this author, a majority of commentators use the ‘consequence-based’ model and conclude that cyber operations committed with the intention to cause material destruction, injuries and/or deaths analogous to those produced by kinetic weapons are to be considered as armed force.\nThe appropriateness of the ‘consequence-based’ model is today confirmed by State views where several States regard cyber technology as a new form of warfare. By 2012, the 15 States with the biggest military budgets are all investing in offensive cyber capabilities. The United States, China, Iran, Israel and Russia have already introduced cyber technology into their military strategies and have established military units with specific cyber expertise.

In response to a UN General Assembly’s invitation to inform the UN Security Council on the States’ position regarding information security, the United Kingdom, Australia, the United States, and Iran expressly stated that international law on the use of force applies. States did not yet categorise empirical cases of cyber attacks as constituting a use of force. In particular, since they did not lead to material damage or injury, the massive distributed ‘denial of service’ attacks that targeted Estonia’s web servers in 2007 or similar attacks that targeted Georgia’s websites when Russian forces invaded South Ossetia in 2008 were not qualified by States as uses of force. More surprisingly, no State considered as a use of force the attack caused by the Stuxnet virus that damaged Iran’s centrifuges for uranium enrichment in Natanz in 2010. The reason may be that this attack was unprecedented - the first computer operation that successfully targeted an industry and caused material destruction beyond the computer system itself. In any case, States increasingly acknowledge the possibility of a categorisation of severe cyber attacks as a use of force, and may react differently if a cyber attack with consequences as severe or more severe than those of the Stuxnet attack occurs in the future.\nSome commentators have advanced another and third approach for categorising when a cyber attack is to be considered as a use of force, namely the ‘target-based’ or ‘strict liability’ approach. This approach treats any cyber attack against a critical national infrastructure as a use of force because of the possible severe effects if such an infrastructure is disabled. There are several issues with such an approach. First, there is no fixed international definition of the term ‘critical infrastructure’. States generally agree that critical infrastructures constitute services such as water distribution, health, energy, transportation, banking and finance. However, as long as this term is not precisely defined by treaty law, States can transform and extend this enumerative list as they wish. Secondly, and most importantly, the ‘target-based’ approach is dangerously overbroad. Indeed, it assumes that any critical infrastructure network penetration reveals hostile intent and justifies the use of the right to self-defence, including anticipatory self-defence, whatever the level of damage finally caused. Third, this approach is not supported by States views. For all these reasons, the ‘target-based’ approach is to be rejected.\n ‘Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunication in the Context of International Security’ (20 July 2010) UN Doc A/65/154, 15.\n Ibid, 6.\n Ibid, 18-19.\n Ibid, 12.\n Hathaway et al.

Is a Cyber Attack a Grave Form of Armed Force?\nIn accordance with Article 51 of the UN Charter, ‘[n]othing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations...’. This provision is also a part of customary international law. The bedrock principle of self-defence is that it may be invoked in response to an armed attack. The question is then whether a cyber attack can constitute an armed attack, triggering the victim State’s right to respond through self-defence. In its Nicaragua judgment, the International Court of Justice referred to Article 3(g) of the ‘Definition of Aggression’ appended to a resolution of the UN General Assembly as concerning an ‘armed attack’. The Court reaffirmed this approach in its Armed Activities judgment. The Definition of Aggression can thus be used to define the concept of armed attack. Article 2 of the Definition states that aggression is ‘...the use of armed force by a State against the sovereignty, territorial integrity or political independence of another State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Charter of the United Nations’. Its Article 3 provides examples of aggression that are widely accepted by the international community. The list, however, deals only with conventional armed attacks involving the use of kinetic force. Article 2 of the Definition also specifies that an act of aggression must be of ‘sufficient gravity’. Similarly, the International Court of Justice has stated that the ‘most grave forms of the use of force’ constitute armed attacks, not ‘less grave forms’. Therefore not every use of armed force is necessarily deemed an armed attack. The scope, duration and intensity of the armed force must be assessed to determine whether an armed attack has occurred. The restriction of the implementation of self-defence to the use of serious armed force expresses the UN Charter’s intent to limit inter-State force. Furthermore, for the International Court of Justice, an armed attack must be carried out ‘...with the specific intention of harming’. If these statements are applied to cyber operations, it appears that an intentional disruption of digitised communications that causes only a minor destruction of physical property will reach the level of armed force but not that of an armed attack. By contrast, when a cyber operation is perpetrated with the intention of seriously destroying physical property and/or injuring or killing persons, that operation will qualify as an armed attack. For instance, if a computer attack causes a wagon of a goods train to crash, this may be considered as an illegal use of armed force but is unlikely to be regarded as an armed attack. On the contrary, a computer attack that leads to the crash of several passenger trains would very likely be considered as an armed attack.

It remains up to State practice to determine what level of damage is required to allow the legal use of self-defence. In this author’s opinion, only a limited number of cyber attacks, those causing severe material destruction, injury or death, should be considered as armed attacks. Without any doubt, the examples involving oil pipelines and refineries, dams, nuclear power plants and so on - which were cited above as uses of armed force - should also be regarded as armed attacks.\nIt should be noted that State practice seems to evolve towards the recognition of the ‘accumulation of effects’ doctrine, according to which the accumulation of several attacks from the same originator that do not on their own achieve the threshold of an armed attack constitute an armed attack in combination. The United States and Israel in particular approve the ‘accumulation of effects’ theory. The International Court of Justice did not expressly pronounce on the matter, but equally seemed to have implicitly endorsed it. Such accumulation theory may, however, be abused in order to justify the recourse to force. It is argued that cyber attacks that do not reach the level of an armed attack individually can constitute an armed attack when aggregated only if they are related and only if they occur within a relative short period of time.\n# 4. The Inappropriate Law on Self-defence in Response to Cyber Attacks\n## A. Absence of a Right to Self-Defence Against Non-State Cyber Attackers\nArticle 51 of the UN Charter does not expressly require that an armed attack be committed by a State in order to trigger the right to self-defence.

Could the State victim of a cyber attack exercise its right to self-defence against a non-State actor author of the attack? The International Court of Justice clearly stated that the Charter only ‘...recognises the existence of an inherent right of self-defence in the case of armed attack by one State against another State’. In another case, it declined to elaborate on whether actions by non-State actors would constitute an armed attack that would trigger an armed defense response. States, in particular the United States and Israel, have sometimes used force against non-State actors. After the defeat of the Taliban regime in November 2001, action in self-defence of the United States and its allies was no longer directed against the State of Afghanistan, but solely against the Al-Qaeda terrorist organisation and Taliban forces. The legality of this action was not, at least at the beginning, contested. In 2006 Israel took self-defence action against Hezbollah in Lebanon, declaring that it was acting not against the State of Lebanon -to which it was not able to attribute Hezbollah’s conduct - but against Hezbollah itself. Although many States criticised the disproportionate way in which Israel exercised its right to self-defence, they accepted that Israel enjoyed such a right in reaction to the attacks of Hezbollah. When, in other precedents, States invoked the right to self-defence against non-State actors, in particular terrorist organisations, without showing any involvement of the State where they were based, third States were, however, reluctant to recognise the legality of the forcible action. In recent State practice, there is no general and clear approval of the legality of the right to self-defence against non-State actors. Therefore it can be concluded that customary international law has not broadened, at least not yet, the right to self-defence to encompass action against non-State actors, authors of a cyber attack or not. Indeed, to recognise a right to self-defence against a non-State actor would be an infringement of the fundamental international principle of the territorial integrity of the State where the non-State actor is based. Furthermore, this could lead to a risk of abuse. States might engage in military operations against non-State actors although law enforcement through international organs would be the more normatively appropriate reaction.\n## B. Absence of a Right to Self-Defence Against States Actively Supporting Non-State Cyber Attackers\nThe right to self-defence can be carried out against a State that commits a cyber operation similar to an armed attack.

Article 3(g) of the Definition of Aggression qualifies as an act of aggression that can also be seen as a case of an armed attack the substantial involvement of a State in one of the acts of aggression referred to by Paragraphs b) to f) of Article 3. If a State provides financial, technical or other material support (below the level of direction and control) to an organisation and if this support significantly helps the commission by that organisation of a cyber attack whose level is equivalent to that of an armed attack and that is directed against another State, is the support of the State in the commission of the armed attack a ‘substantial involvement’ that corresponds to an armed attack? The International Court of Justice advocated a strict interpretation of ‘substantial involvement’ and held that ‘...assistance to rebels in the form of provision of weapons or logistical or other support’ does not fall into the category of armed attack. This legal position does not seem to have changed since. In current State practice, the supply of money, arms and logistical help has rarely been regarded as armed attack. However, even if it does not constitute an armed attack, such a supply is illegal and engages the responsibility of the State under international law. Indeed, a State is bound by an obligation not to actively support damageable conduct of non-State actors directed against another State. Concerning for instance activities of terrorist non-State actors, the UN Security Council has stressed that ‘...every Member State has the duty to refrain from organising, instigating, assisting or participating in terrorist acts in another State or acquiescing in organised activities within its territory directed toward the commission of such acts’.\nIn the opinion of this author, the law on self-defence should evolve in order to offer a more efficient response to international offensive cyber operations. The concept of ‘substantial involvement’ should be reinterpreted and include a lesser degree of State involvement than the one that seems to be required by the International Court of Justice. When a State provides practical assistance to an organisation for the purpose of assisting it with the commission of a computer network attack against another State - similar to an armed attack - and when this assistance substantially contributes to the commission of the attack, State practice should change in such a way that the State is regarded as having committed an armed attack itself. In such a situation, the victim State should have the right to self-defence against the relevant State.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2593868\n Definition of Aggression (n 47).\n Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (n 15) para. 195.\n The case law of the Nicaragua case was confirmed in Case Concerning Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo (n 46) paras. 106-147.\n Gray (n 59) 132.\n Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (n 15) para.205.\n UNSC Res 1189 (1998) preamble, UN Doc S/RES/1189.\n In his dissenting opinion to the Nicaragua case, Judge Schwebel found that the concept of ‘substantial involvement’ could also include financial and logistical support.

Absence of a Right to Self-Defence Against States Passively Supporting Non-State Cyber Attackers\nAnother question is whether a State that simply tolerates computer network attacks which are as severe as armed attacks and are mounted from within its territory or an area under its exclusive control against another State can be regarded as perpetrating an armed attack itself? This question was asked most famously in relation to non-cyber activities, those of 11 September 2001 against the United States mounted by the Al-Qaeda terrorist organisation from within Taliban-led Afghanistan. Afghanistan had harboured Al-Qaeda, and had not complied with UN Security Council resolutions asking it to stop doing so. It did not, however, control the 11 September attacks. These attacks were clearly similar in scale and effect to an armed attack. The United States (supported by allies, in particular the United Kingdom) began a military action against the Al-Qaeda organisation and also against the State of Afghanistan from 7 October 2001. Both the United States and the United Kingdom reported to the UN Security Council that the military intervention was taken in accordance with their right to individual self-defence and to collective self-defence respectively. The UN Security Council recognised the existence of such a right to self-defence. The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation and the Organisation of American States also invoked the right to self-defence to assist the United States in its response to the attacks. Overall, the military action in self-defence against Afghanistan received massive support from the international community. Considering the international approval of the military intervention in Afghanistan, can one conclude that self-defence can be invoked against a State tolerating non-State actors' activities that amount to an armed attack? The problem is that it is impossible to adduce conclusive State practice and *opinio juris* - both of which are necessary for the emergence of a customary international rule in support of this argument - other than that showed in the Afghanistan case of 2001. Therefore, it is not enshrined in current customary international law that self-defence can be implemented against a State tolerating the organisation of non-State actors' attacks, cyber or not, against another State from within its territory or an area under its exclusive control.\nThe tolerance by a State of the organisation of international attacks from within its territory is, however, illegal as will be shown in the following analysis. In accordance with the International Court of Justice in the Corfu Channel case of 1949, every State is under an obligation ‘...not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States’. More specifically, the 1970 Declaration on Friendly Relations adopted by consensus by the UN General Assembly urges States to ‘...refrain from...acquiescing [in] organised activities within [their]\n Gray (n 59) 200-201.\n Letters of the Permanent Representatives of the United States and of the United Kingdom to the United Nations, UN Docs S/2001/946 and S/2001/947 respectively.\n UNSC Res 1368 (2001) preamble, UN Doc S/RES/1368 and UNSC Res 1373 (2001) preamble, UN Doc S/RES/1373.\n Gray (n 59) 193-194.\n Gray (n 59) 136-140 and 230-231; Olivier Corten, *The Law Against War* (Oregon, Hart Publishing, 2002) 183-186.\n The Corfu Channel Case (United Kingdom v Albania) [1949] ICJ Rep 4, 22.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2593868\nESIL CONFERENCE PAPER SERIES\n[VOL. 4 NO 16]\nterritory directed towards the commission of [civil strife or terrorism in another State]. Concerning cyber attacks, the 2001 Resolution on Combating the Criminal Misuse of Information Technologies calls upon States to prevent their territories from being used as a safe haven from which to launch cyber attacks, and to cooperate in the investigation and prosecution of such attacks. It is now widely recognised that a State has a positive customary obligation of due diligence to prevent the commission of unlawful activities from within its territory or any area under its exclusive control against another State. In particular, a State should take necessary and reasonable measures to prevent non-State actors using its internet gateways to perpetrate computer network attacks against another State. A State must not knowingly permit its territory or any other space under its exclusive control to be used as a sanctuary for cyber actors bent on attacking targets in another country. When a State is unable to meet its obligation to prevent such action, either because it lacks the territorial control necessary to do so, or because it does not have the human or logistical resources available, it is under an obligation to seek assistance in preventing cyber attacks. If a State fails to seek such assistance, this should be interpreted as an unwillingness to meet its obligation to prevent cyber attacks against other States from its territory. The unwillingness of a State to perform its obligation to counter international offensive cyber operations does not trigger the right to self-defence of the victim State, but nevertheless does engage the international responsibility of the relevant State. For instance, if States were unable to attribute to Russia the cyber attacks against Estonia in 2007, but this State is nevertheless suspected of tolerating the private groups, as authors of the cyber attacks, that engages its international responsibility.\nIn the opinion of this author, the law on self-defence should change. When a State infringes its obligation to prevent unlawful acts against another State committed on its territory or in an area under its exclusive control, and knowingly harbours a group preparing and perpetrating cyber attacks equivalent to armed attacks, this author argues that the State forfeits its right to territorial integrity. In this scenario, State practice should evolve so as to entitle the State victim of a cyber attack to use force in self-defence against the author of the cyber attack. The host State should, however, be given the opportunity to comply with its obligation to prevent international cyber offensives before there is a resort to action in self-defence. If international cyber attacks whose level is similar to that of armed attacks are prepared and committed from the territory of a failed State, then in this situation too, the victim State should have the right to self-defence against the cyber attackers. Indeed, if a State persists in not attempting to prevent cyber attacks equivalent to\n Declaration on Principles of International Law Concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation Among States in Accordance with the Charter of the United Nations (n 21) para. 1.\n GA Res 55/63 (22 January 2001), UN Doc A/RES/55/63, para. 1.\n Jeffrey Carr, Inside Cyber Warfare: Mapping the Cyber Underworld (2ⁿᵈ ed, Sebastopol, O’Reilly, 2013) 62-67; David E Graham, ‘Cyber Threats and the Law of War’ (2010) 4 Journal of National Security Law and Policy 87, 93-94.\n Kimberley N Trapp, ‘Back to Basics: Necessity, Proportionality and the Right of Self-Defence Against Non-State Terrorist Actors’ (2007) 56 ICLQ 147.\n Ruys and Verhoeven (n 69) 306.

The requirement of the necessity of the use of the right to self-defence is thus fulfilled.\nIn order to be more effective in response to international severe cyber attacks, a broader consensus in the international community should emerge towards the legality of the use of force in self-defence against cyber attackers committing cyber attacks equivalent to armed attacks and located in another State that does not prevent such attacks. The rationale behind this proposal is that the victim State should be entitled to engage in measures of prevention and suppression of cyber attacks which the host State should have performed itself. Therefore, the victim State should only target the cyber attackers and should not be allowed to react in self-defence against institutions of the host State. Furthermore, in the opinion of this author, the provision by a State of a safe haven to a cyber attacker is not serious enough so as to constitute an armed attack, even if the safe haven is necessary for, for example, planning and organising a cyber attack amounted to an armed attack. To argue otherwise would increase too much the possibility of resort to the use of force in self-defence.\nThe obligation of a State to prevent the perpetration by territorial actors of cyber attacks against other States, especially if they reach the level of armed attacks, is to be implemented with due diligence. It does not require the prevention of every international offensive cyber action but the adoption of reasonable measures in the light of the circumstances in order to generally prevent international cyber attacks. To assess whether a State respects its obligation of due diligence in the prevention of international cyber attacks, it should be checked: whether there has been a continuous pattern of cyber attacks from the relevant State; whether the State criminalises the commission of cyber attacks; whether the State conducts detailed investigations into cyber attacks; whether the State prosecutes cyber attackers; and whether the State cooperates with the victim States' investigations and prosecutions of the cyber attackers, especially when it lacks the capacity to investigate and prosecute those who have committed the cyber attacks. A careful assessment of all these facts is needed in order not to over stretch the limits of self-defence. Resort to self-defence should here be a last means to react to cyber attacks.\n Ashley S Deeks, “‘Unwilling or Unable’: Toward a Normative Framework for Extraterritorial Self-Defence” (2012) 52 Virginia Journal of International Law 483, 494; Trapp (n 79) 142.\n Yoram Dinstein, War, Aggression and Self-Defence (4th ed, CUP, 2005) 245.\n Sonja Cenic, ‘State Responsibility and Self-Defence in International Law Post 9/11: Has the Scope of Article 51 of the United Nations Charter Been Widened as a Result of the US Response to 9/11?’ (2007) 14 Australian International Law Journal 201, 214-215.\n Graham (n 78)94.

Conclusion\nThe victim State of an international cyber attack could react within its right to self-defence if the cyber attack were attributable to a State and if the cyber attack had consequences similar to those of a traditional armed attack, namely severe material damage, human injury or human loss. Given the strict criteria governing the attribution of conduct to a State, most electronic attacks will not be attributable to a State. The current international right to self-defence does not, however, provide the State victim of a serious international computer network attack by a non-State actor with the legal possibility of reacting with force against that actor. Furthermore, it does not allow a reaction against a State that actively supports cyber attackers and provides financial, logistical or other support to them so that they are able to commit a cyber attack equivalent to an armed attack against another State. Finally, the current right to self-defence cannot be implemented against a State that harbours individuals or groups committing international cyber attacks from within its territory even if they amount to armed attacks. Therefore, the current international right to self-defence offers an incomplete and inadequate response to serious international cyber attacks.\nIn the opinion of this author, the law on self-defence should be amended and adapted to meet the distinctive challenges posed by severe international cyber attacks that are likely to be committed mostly by non-State actors. First, when a State provides practical assistance to a non-State organisation for the purpose of assisting it with the commission of a computer network attack against another State, similar to an armed attack, and when this assistance substantially contributes to the commission of the attack, State practice should change in such a way that the State is regarded as having committed an armed attack itself. In such a situation, the victim State should have the right to self-defence against the relevant State. Second, and this second scenario may occur more frequently than the first one, when a State knowingly harbours a non-State group preparing and perpetrating cyber attacks equivalent to armed attacks, it is here argued that it forfeits its right to territorial integrity. In this case, State practice should evolve so as to entitle the State victim of the cyber attacks to act in self-defence against the group - and only against it. In the exceptional situation when a cyber attack equivalent to an armed attack is committed against a State by a non-State actor based in the territory of a failed State, the victim State should also be allowed to implement its right to self-defence against the non-State actor. In all these circumstances, the action in self-defence could be traditional, and take a military form or cyber, and thus have effects similar to those of a forcible action in self-defence. The proposed changes in the implementation of the law to self-defence could occur through treaty law. However, it is unlikely that a majority of States will agree on a text governing reaction with force to cyber attacks in a near future, as there are fundamental differences between States on the interpretation on the international law on self-defence. It is therefore hoped that the proposed changes will emerge in customary international law through State practice.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2593868",

Introduction\nStates have become increasingly dependent on computers and the networks that connect them. The development of cyber space enables States and non-State actors to increase their offensive capabilities significantly. Cyber technology is now likely to become an essential offensive tool, in particular for terrorist organisations. It is even more the case that cyber attacks can be carried out more easily and with a lower risk of detection than attacks with conventional weapons: it is enough to have a computer and a connection to the internet. The concern that transnational terrorist or other non-State organisations may turn to cyber operations as a means of attacking States is well-founded. For instance, Al-Qaeda computers containing hacker tools have been seized and the membership of such a group has an increasing computer expertise. In his State of the Union Address of 2014, the President of the United States referred to the need to ‘...combat new threats like cyber attacks’. A cyber attack can be defined as a deliberate action ‘...taken through the use of computer networks to disrupt, deceive, degrade, manipulate or destroy information resident in the target information system or computer networks, or the systems/networks themselves’. Cyber attacks may produce effects that are not only internal to a\nThe term ‘non-State actor’ refers to terrorist groups, rebel groups, other organised groups and individuals.\nMichael N Schmitt, ‘Cyber Operations and the Jus Ad Bellum Revisited’ (2011-2012) 56 Villanova Law Review 569, 600.\n<http: 01=\"\" 2014=\"\" 28=\"\" president-barack-obamas-state-union-address=\"\" the-press-office=\"\" www.whitehouse.gov=\"\"> accessed 1 December 2014.\n<http: 2010-11-joint%20terminology%20for%20cyberspace%20operations.pdf=\"\" cyberreferencelib=\"\" www.nsci-va.org=\"\"> accessed 1 December 2014.\nElectronic copy available at: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2593868</http:></http:>\nESIL CONFERENCE PAPER SERIES\n[VOL. 4 NO 16]\ncomputer or network but also external, by causing harm to connected facilities which could in turn lead to serious physical harm to property or individuals. Such would be the case for example when a computer network attack disables an air traffic control system and, thereby, causes an airliner to crash, resulting in material and physical destruction. In other words, a cyber operation may treat the target computer or computer network as the conduit for an attack on a physical target.\nTo what extent does international law on self-defence allow a State to react to cyber attacks? To implement the rules on the right to self-defence may entail certain difficulties in view of the specific characteristics of cyber technology. In particular, given the fast and anonymous character of a cyber attack, it may be difficult to attribute it to the author of that attack. Section II of this paper will outline the international criteria for the attribution of a cyber operation to a State. Section III will argue that only cyber attacks reaching the level of an armed attack give the right to the victim State to use self-defence. Section IV will explain that the law on self-defence does not offer an effective response to cyber attacks because, as international law stands, only cyber attacks attributed to States trigger the right to self-defence. Section V concludes that current international law on self-defence needs to be adapted to meet the challenges posed by cyber attacks.\n# 2. The Difficult Attribution of a Cyber Attack\nA crucial issue in any response in self-defence to a cyber attack is first to identify the author of the attack against whom action can be taken. Attribution is necessary for the effectiveness as well as for the lawfulness of the counter-action. International law does not know any specific standards of evidence with regard to issues involving the use of armed force in self-defence. There is, however, a general agreement that the graver the charge the more confidence there must be in the evidence. Therefore, a State should determine with a high degree of confidence the identity of the author of a cyber attack before exercising its right to self-defence against it.\nThe author of a cyber attack may claim responsibility for it. For instance, a group that commits a cyber attack may claim credit for it in a message posted online or on a videotape given to the media. The style of a cyber attack may also help to identify the organisation responsible for it. Otherwise, attribution of a cyber attack is a complicated exercise because of the nature of the cyber domain. Not only must the attack be traced back to its source, i.e. to a computer, but the person who operated the computer must also be identified or his affiliation determined. Unlike the case of an attacker in the physical world, a cyber attacker has the ability to launch an attack anonymously. In particular, in order to hide the real origin of an attack, cyber attackers may route\n Separate Opinion of Judge Higgins in Case Concerning Oil Platforms (Islamic Republic of Iran v United States of America) [2003] ICJ Rep, paras. 30-39.\n Susan W Brenner, ‘At Light Speed: Attribution and Response to Cybercrime/Terrorism/Warfare’ (2007) 97 Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology 379, 408.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2593868\nESIL CONFERENCE PAPER SERIES\n[VOL. 4 NO 16]\nan attack through a number of servers based around the globe prior to hitting the target system. To trace back an attack through those computers will require assistance from government and civilian entities in the States in which the computers were used. It can take months before assistance from the relevant States is obtained and the attack tracked back to its true point of origin. A further issue in identifying the perpetrator of a cyber attack is caused by the volatility of electronic data, which may be altered, moved or deleted in seconds. Lastly, once the origin and the author of a damageable international cyber operation are known, it may be difficult to assess its real purpose. The cyber operation might not be hostile but attributable only to faulty software or to an accidental computer error or malfunction. In April and May 2007, Estonia’s digital infrastructure was the victim of a massive computer network attack. Distributed ‘denial of service’ attacks targeted Estonia’s web services and brought Estonian web traffic to a halt. Since Estonia heavily relied on internet services, the impact of the cyber assault was very inconvenient. Most of the attacks emanated from abroad, principally Russia. It could not, however, be firmly demonstrated that the Russian government either conducted or orchestrated them. The origin of the attacks was also traced to at least 177 other States. This example of cyber attacks from at least 178 countries shows how challenging it could be to attribute a cyber operation to its author. In order to be able to respond effectively to cyber attacks, States should continue their technically based effort to enhance the capacity to trace their source in real-time.\nIt is expected that most electronic attacks will be performed by non-State actors. They may also be committed by or on behalf of a State, as suspected of Russia. In that case, one would expect a State that commits a cyber attack to attempt to make it look like that of a hacker. Under international law, a cyber operation can be attributed to a State especially in the following four circumstances. The first is where a cyber act is performed by an organ of a State, for example a member of its armed forces. This conclusion does not change if the hacker is a civilian, non-military, organ of the State. In accordance with Article 4 of the 2001 Draft Articles of the International Law Commission that mostly codifies customary international law on the responsibility of States: ‘[t]he conduct of any State organ shall be considered an act of that State under international law, whether the organ exercises legislative, executive, judicial or any other functions...’. The second situation of attribution of a cyber act to a State is when the act is performed by a person or entity empowered by the State to exercise governmental authority. For instance, if a State charges a private defence company with elements of authority normally associated with the government and asks it to conduct cyber operations, these operations will be imputed to the State. The third scenario in which a cyber operation may be attributed to a State is where the acting entity did so under the instructions, direction or control of a State. Such would be the case if a State hires an individual or an organisation to commit a cyber attack. Article 8 of the Draft Articles on the Responsibility of States reads: ‘The conduct of a person or group of\nIbid, 409.\nIbid, 420.\nIbid, 434-435.\n Schmitt (n 2) 569-570.\nJason Barkham, ‘Information Warfare and International Law on the Use of Force’(2001-2002) 34 NYU Journal of International Law and Politics 57, 58-59.\nOfficial Records of the UN General Assembly, Fifty-Sixth Session, Supplement No. 10 (A/56/10), Chp.IVE.1.\nArticle 5 of the Draft Articles on the Responsibility of States, ibid.\n[4]\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2593868\nESIL CONFERENCE PAPER SERIES\n[VOL. 4 NO 16]\npersons shall be considered an act of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct. The degree of direction or control must be high, which means that the State should have effectively directed or controlled the specific cyber operation. The reality of the control exercised on the ground should be determined on a case-by-case basis. It has been argued that the technical difficulty of attributing cyber attacks could only be responded to effectively by using a lower threshold for attribution, namely the criterion of ‘overall control’ that covers the case where a State coordinates or helps in the general planning of the relevant operation. Such an approach would, however, extend the use of the right to self-defence in response to cyber attacks in a dangerous manner and should be rejected. Finally, in accordance with Article 11 of the Draft Articles on the Responsibility of States: ‘[c]onduct ...shall...be considered an act of that State under international law if and to the extent that the State acknowledges and adopts the conduct in question as its own’. In order to avoid counter-measures taken by the victim State, it is unlikely that a State will publicly acknowledge a cyber attack.\n# 3. The Qualification of a Cyber Attack as an Armed Attack\n## A. The Prohibition of Inter-State Armed Force\nArticle 2(4) of the UN Charter states: ‘All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations’. The mainstream view among States and international lawyers is that the ‘other manner’ language extends to any use of force not authorised by the Charter, even if it does not threaten the territorial integrity or the political independence of a State. Since the expression ‘force’ in Article 2(4) is not preceded by the adjective ‘armed’, the scope of the ‘force’ to which Article 2(4) refers remains unclear and, in particular, whether it extends to economic or political force. The expression ‘armed force’ appears elsewhere in the Charter (in paragraph 7 of the Preamble to the Charter as well as in Articles 41 and 46). Furthermore, the first and principal purpose of the United Nations is, according to Article 1(1) of the Charter, to maintain international peace. Therefore, the interpretation of Article 2(4) in the context of the UN Charter is that it forbids the use of inter-State armed force by States parties. The preparatory work of the UN Charter confirms the fact that the prohibition contained in Article 2(4) is concerned only with military force. This conclusion is corroborated by resolutions of the UN General Assembly that deal with issues of\n Ibid.\n *Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v United States)*[1986]ICJ Rep 14, para. 115.\n Scott J Shackelford, ‘From Nuclear War to Net War: Analogising Cyber Attacks in International Law’ (2009) 27 Berkeley Journal of International Law 192, 235.\n *Prosecutor v Dusko Tadic* (15 July 1994) Judgment Appeals Chamber ICTY, IT-94-1-A, para. 131.\n *Official Records of the UN General Assembly* (n 12).\n Albrecht Randelzhofer and Oliver Dörr, ‘Article 2(4)’ in Bruno Simma (ed), *The Charter of the United Nations* (Vol. I, 2ⁿᵈ ed, OUP, 2012) 215-216.\n *Documents of the United Nations Conference on International Organisation*, 1945, Vol. VI, 559 and 720.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2593868\nESIL CONFERENCE PAPER SERIES\n[VOL. 4 NO 16]\npeace and security and which received the consent of a high majority of the States members of the Assembly. International State practice also confirms a narrow scope of Article 2(4). In conclusion, the prohibition of the use of inter-State force in the UN Charter as well as in general public international law covers only armed force and not economic, political and other types of coercion, unless coupled with the use or at least the threat of armed force.\n## B. Is a Cyber Attack Armed Force?\nIs a cyber act equivalent to armed force prohibited by Article 2(4) of the UN Charter? This can be the case only if the act is committed by a State against another State. A cyber act of an individual or an entity that is not acting on behalf of a State is tried as criminal action even when the attacker acts from abroad and claims to be waging war against the victim State. Furthermore, in order to be covered by the prohibition of inter-State use of force, a cyber act must be similar to armed force. Neither the UN Charter nor the International Court of Justice provides a definition of ‘armed force’. ‘Armed’ can be defined as ‘[e]quipped with a weapon’ or ‘[i]nvolving the use of a weapon’. A weapon is ‘[a]n instrument used or designed to be used to injure or kill someone’. Or a weapon is ‘...a thing designed or used for inflicting bodily harm or physical damage’. In its Advisory Opinion on the Legality of the Use of Nuclear Weapons, the International Court of Justice stated that Article 2(4) of the UN Charter does ‘not refer to specific weapons’. It applies ‘...to any use of force, regardless of the weapons employed’. Therefore, should cyber technology be used to injure or kill, it should be regarded as a ‘weapon’.\nTwo main approaches can be adopted to determine whether a cyber attack constitutes ‘armed force’. The first approach is an ‘instrument-based’ one. Using this model, an assessment is made as to whether a cyber operation may intrinsically involve physical force like a conventional weapon. Physical force is traditionally understood as involving ‘...any explosive effect with shock waves and heat’. Cyber operations do not intrinsically imply such physical force and therefore the ‘instrument-based’ model does not fit them. The second approach is the ‘consequence-based’ approach. Here an assessment is made as to whether the overall effects of a computer network attack are equivalent to those of an attack using a traditional weapon. The ‘consequence-based’ approach regards as armed force the use of any new means that leads to serious destructive effects. It is more flexible than the ‘instrument-based’ approach and can adapt to the technical evolution of warfare. It allows the inclusion of certain cyber attacks in the notion of ‘armed force’ even if the drafters of the UN Charter did not think of this possibility in 1945 simply because it was then not technically possible. The ‘instrument-based’ approach has already been applied by Brownlie to biological and chemical devices.

Similarly, under the ‘consequence-based’ approach cyber operations may cause damage to tangible property, injury (including illness) or death. There are many examples of computer network attacks that should be considered as armed force: a cyber attack on the controlling system of air or train traffic, causing the crash of a plane or a train; a cyber operation creating a hammering phenomenon in oil pipelines causing them to burst; a cyber attack that shuts down power to a hospital with no back-up generators, or disrupts emergency response communications systems; a cyber attack that incapacitates the computers that control oil refineries, leading to the release of deadly effluents; a cyber operation shutting down computers controlling waterworks and dams, generating flooding of inhabited regions; a cyber attack disabling the systems that control a reactor of a nuclear power plant, leading to the release of radioactive materials. In these different situations, the severity of the consequences of the cyber operation - material destruction, injuries and/or deaths - rises to a level equal to that of an attack with kinetic weapons. By contrast, a cyber attack that interferes with the computers through which financial transactions are recorded and settled, and that disrupts a State’s financial system, would not constitute armed force because there is no destruction of objects or human injury. In the opinion of this author, qualifying such a cyber operation as a use of force would depart too much from the traditional definition of force and therefore also of an armed attack - an armed attack being a severe use of force - and would thus expand too much the use of the right to self-defence in response to an armed attack. Like this author, a majority of commentators use the ‘consequence-based’ model and conclude that cyber operations committed with the intention to cause material destruction, injuries and/or deaths analogous to those produced by kinetic weapons are to be considered as armed force.\nThe appropriateness of the ‘consequence-based’ model is today confirmed by State views where several States regard cyber technology as a new form of warfare. By 2012, the 15 States with the biggest military budgets are all investing in offensive cyber capabilities. The United States, China, Iran, Israel and Russia have already introduced cyber technology into their military strategies and have established military units with specific cyber expertise.

In response to a UN General Assembly’s invitation to inform the UN Security Council on the States’ position regarding information security, the United Kingdom, Australia, the United States, and Iran expressly stated that international law on the use of force applies. States did not yet categorise empirical cases of cyber attacks as constituting a use of force. In particular, since they did not lead to material damage or injury, the massive distributed ‘denial of service’ attacks that targeted Estonia’s web servers in 2007 or similar attacks that targeted Georgia’s websites when Russian forces invaded South Ossetia in 2008 were not qualified by States as uses of force. More surprisingly, no State considered as a use of force the attack caused by the Stuxnet virus that damaged Iran’s centrifuges for uranium enrichment in Natanz in 2010. The reason may be that this attack was unprecedented - the first computer operation that successfully targeted an industry and caused material destruction beyond the computer system itself. In any case, States increasingly acknowledge the possibility of a categorisation of severe cyber attacks as a use of force, and may react differently if a cyber attack with consequences as severe or more severe than those of the Stuxnet attack occurs in the future.\nSome commentators have advanced another and third approach for categorising when a cyber attack is to be considered as a use of force, namely the ‘target-based’ or ‘strict liability’ approach. This approach treats any cyber attack against a critical national infrastructure as a use of force because of the possible severe effects if such an infrastructure is disabled. There are several issues with such an approach. First, there is no fixed international definition of the term ‘critical infrastructure’. States generally agree that critical infrastructures constitute services such as water distribution, health, energy, transportation, banking and finance. However, as long as this term is not precisely defined by treaty law, States can transform and extend this enumerative list as they wish. Secondly, and most importantly, the ‘target-based’ approach is dangerously overbroad. Indeed, it assumes that any critical infrastructure network penetration reveals hostile intent and justifies the use of the right to self-defence, including anticipatory self-defence, whatever the level of damage finally caused. Third, this approach is not supported by States views. For all these reasons, the ‘target-based’ approach is to be rejected.\n ‘Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunication in the Context of International Security’ (20 July 2010) UN Doc A/65/154, 15.\n Ibid, 6.\n Ibid, 18-19.\n Ibid, 12.\n Hathaway et al.

Is a Cyber Attack a Grave Form of Armed Force?\nIn accordance with Article 51 of the UN Charter, ‘[n]othing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations...’. This provision is also a part of customary international law. The bedrock principle of self-defence is that it may be invoked in response to an armed attack. The question is then whether a cyber attack can constitute an armed attack, triggering the victim State’s right to respond through self-defence. In its Nicaragua judgment, the International Court of Justice referred to Article 3(g) of the ‘Definition of Aggression’ appended to a resolution of the UN General Assembly as concerning an ‘armed attack’. The Court reaffirmed this approach in its Armed Activities judgment. The Definition of Aggression can thus be used to define the concept of armed attack. Article 2 of the Definition states that aggression is ‘...the use of armed force by a State against the sovereignty, territorial integrity or political independence of another State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Charter of the United Nations’. Its Article 3 provides examples of aggression that are widely accepted by the international community. The list, however, deals only with conventional armed attacks involving the use of kinetic force. Article 2 of the Definition also specifies that an act of aggression must be of ‘sufficient gravity’. Similarly, the International Court of Justice has stated that the ‘most grave forms of the use of force’ constitute armed attacks, not ‘less grave forms’. Therefore not every use of armed force is necessarily deemed an armed attack. The scope, duration and intensity of the armed force must be assessed to determine whether an armed attack has occurred. The restriction of the implementation of self-defence to the use of serious armed force expresses the UN Charter’s intent to limit inter-State force. Furthermore, for the International Court of Justice, an armed attack must be carried out ‘...with the specific intention of harming’. If these statements are applied to cyber operations, it appears that an intentional disruption of digitised communications that causes only a minor destruction of physical property will reach the level of armed force but not that of an armed attack. By contrast, when a cyber operation is perpetrated with the intention of seriously destroying physical property and/or injuring or killing persons, that operation will qualify as an armed attack. For instance, if a computer attack causes a wagon of a goods train to crash, this may be considered as an illegal use of armed force but is unlikely to be regarded as an armed attack. On the contrary, a computer attack that leads to the crash of several passenger trains would very likely be considered as an armed attack.

It remains up to State practice to determine what level of damage is required to allow the legal use of self-defence. In this author’s opinion, only a limited number of cyber attacks, those causing severe material destruction, injury or death, should be considered as armed attacks. Without any doubt, the examples involving oil pipelines and refineries, dams, nuclear power plants and so on - which were cited above as uses of armed force - should also be regarded as armed attacks.\nIt should be noted that State practice seems to evolve towards the recognition of the ‘accumulation of effects’ doctrine, according to which the accumulation of several attacks from the same originator that do not on their own achieve the threshold of an armed attack constitute an armed attack in combination. The United States and Israel in particular approve the ‘accumulation of effects’ theory. The International Court of Justice did not expressly pronounce on the matter, but equally seemed to have implicitly endorsed it. Such accumulation theory may, however, be abused in order to justify the recourse to force. It is argued that cyber attacks that do not reach the level of an armed attack individually can constitute an armed attack when aggregated only if they are related and only if they occur within a relative short period of time.\n# 4. The Inappropriate Law on Self-defence in Response to Cyber Attacks\n## A. Absence of a Right to Self-Defence Against Non-State Cyber Attackers\nArticle 51 of the UN Charter does not expressly require that an armed attack be committed by a State in order to trigger the right to self-defence.

Could the State victim of a cyber attack exercise its right to self-defence against a non-State actor author of the attack? The International Court of Justice clearly stated that the Charter only ‘...recognises the existence of an inherent right of self-defence in the case of armed attack by one State against another State’. In another case, it declined to elaborate on whether actions by non-State actors would constitute an armed attack that would trigger an armed defense response. States, in particular the United States and Israel, have sometimes used force against non-State actors. After the defeat of the Taliban regime in November 2001, action in self-defence of the United States and its allies was no longer directed against the State of Afghanistan, but solely against the Al-Qaeda terrorist organisation and Taliban forces. The legality of this action was not, at least at the beginning, contested. In 2006 Israel took self-defence action against Hezbollah in Lebanon, declaring that it was acting not against the State of Lebanon -to which it was not able to attribute Hezbollah’s conduct - but against Hezbollah itself. Although many States criticised the disproportionate way in which Israel exercised its right to self-defence, they accepted that Israel enjoyed such a right in reaction to the attacks of Hezbollah. When, in other precedents, States invoked the right to self-defence against non-State actors, in particular terrorist organisations, without showing any involvement of the State where they were based, third States were, however, reluctant to recognise the legality of the forcible action. In recent State practice, there is no general and clear approval of the legality of the right to self-defence against non-State actors. Therefore it can be concluded that customary international law has not broadened, at least not yet, the right to self-defence to encompass action against non-State actors, authors of a cyber attack or not. Indeed, to recognise a right to self-defence against a non-State actor would be an infringement of the fundamental international principle of the territorial integrity of the State where the non-State actor is based. Furthermore, this could lead to a risk of abuse. States might engage in military operations against non-State actors although law enforcement through international organs would be the more normatively appropriate reaction.\n## B. Absence of a Right to Self-Defence Against States Actively Supporting Non-State Cyber Attackers\nThe right to self-defence can be carried out against a State that commits a cyber operation similar to an armed attack. Does the right to self-defence also exist against a State that supports an offensive cyber act perpetrated by a non-State actor whose severity is equivalent to that of an\n Raphael Van Steenberghe, ‘Self-defence in Response to Attacks by Non-State Actors in the Light of Recent State Practice: A Step Forward?’ (2010) 23 Leiden Journal of International Law183, 198.\n Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (Advisory Opinion) [2004] ICJ Rep 136, para. 139.\n Case Concerning Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo (n 46) para,147.

Article 3(g) of the Definition of Aggression qualifies as an act of aggression that can also be seen as a case of an armed attack the substantial involvement of a State in one of the acts of aggression referred to by Paragraphs b) to f) of Article 3. If a State provides financial, technical or other material support (below the level of direction and control) to an organisation and if this support significantly helps the commission by that organisation of a cyber attack whose level is equivalent to that of an armed attack and that is directed against another State, is the support of the State in the commission of the armed attack a ‘substantial involvement’ that corresponds to an armed attack? The International Court of Justice advocated a strict interpretation of ‘substantial involvement’ and held that ‘...assistance to rebels in the form of provision of weapons or logistical or other support’ does not fall into the category of armed attack. This legal position does not seem to have changed since. In current State practice, the supply of money, arms and logistical help has rarely been regarded as armed attack. However, even if it does not constitute an armed attack, such a supply is illegal and engages the responsibility of the State under international law. Indeed, a State is bound by an obligation not to actively support damageable conduct of non-State actors directed against another State. Concerning for instance activities of terrorist non-State actors, the UN Security Council has stressed that ‘...every Member State has the duty to refrain from organising, instigating, assisting or participating in terrorist acts in another State or acquiescing in organised activities within its territory directed toward the commission of such acts’.\nIn the opinion of this author, the law on self-defence should evolve in order to offer a more efficient response to international offensive cyber operations. The concept of ‘substantial involvement’ should be reinterpreted and include a lesser degree of State involvement than the one that seems to be required by the International Court of Justice. When a State provides practical assistance to an organisation for the purpose of assisting it with the commission of a computer network attack against another State - similar to an armed attack - and when this assistance substantially contributes to the commission of the attack, State practice should change in such a way that the State is regarded as having committed an armed attack itself. In such a situation, the victim State should have the right to self-defence against the relevant State.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2593868\n Definition of Aggression (n 47).\n Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (n 15) para. 195.\n The case law of the Nicaragua case was confirmed in Case Concerning Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo (n 46) paras. 106-147.\n Gray (n 59) 132.\n Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (n 15) para.205.\n UNSC Res 1189 (1998) preamble, UN Doc S/RES/1189.\n In his dissenting opinion to the Nicaragua case, Judge Schwebel found that the concept of ‘substantial involvement’ could also include financial and logistical support.

Absence of a Right to Self-Defence Against States Passively Supporting Non-State Cyber Attackers\nAnother question is whether a State that simply tolerates computer network attacks which are as severe as armed attacks and are mounted from within its territory or an area under its exclusive control against another State can be regarded as perpetrating an armed attack itself? This question was asked most famously in relation to non-cyber activities, those of 11 September 2001 against the United States mounted by the Al-Qaeda terrorist organisation from within Taliban-led Afghanistan. Afghanistan had harboured Al-Qaeda, and had not complied with UN Security Council resolutions asking it to stop doing so. It did not, however, control the 11 September attacks. These attacks were clearly similar in scale and effect to an armed attack. The United States (supported by allies, in particular the United Kingdom) began a military action against the Al-Qaeda organisation and also against the State of Afghanistan from 7 October 2001. Both the United States and the United Kingdom reported to the UN Security Council that the military intervention was taken in accordance with their right to individual self-defence and to collective self-defence respectively. The UN Security Council recognised the existence of such a right to self-defence. The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation and the Organisation of American States also invoked the right to self-defence to assist the United States in its response to the attacks. Overall, the military action in self-defence against Afghanistan received massive support from the international community. Considering the international approval of the military intervention in Afghanistan, can one conclude that self-defence can be invoked against a State tolerating non-State actors' activities that amount to an armed attack? The problem is that it is impossible to adduce conclusive State practice and *opinio juris* - both of which are necessary for the emergence of a customary international rule in support of this argument - other than that showed in the Afghanistan case of 2001. Therefore, it is not enshrined in current customary international law that self-defence can be implemented against a State tolerating the organisation of non-State actors' attacks, cyber or not, against another State from within its territory or an area under its exclusive control.\nThe tolerance by a State of the organisation of international attacks from within its territory is, however, illegal as will be shown in the following analysis. In accordance with the International Court of Justice in the Corfu Channel case of 1949, every State is under an obligation ‘...not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States’. More specifically, the 1970 Declaration on Friendly Relations adopted by consensus by the UN General Assembly urges States to ‘...refrain from...acquiescing [in] organised activities within [their]\n Gray (n 59) 200-201.\n Letters of the Permanent Representatives of the United States and of the United Kingdom to the United Nations, UN Docs S/2001/946 and S/2001/947 respectively.\n UNSC Res 1368 (2001) preamble, UN Doc S/RES/1368 and UNSC Res 1373 (2001) preamble, UN Doc S/RES/1373.\n Gray (n 59) 193-194.\n Gray (n 59) 136-140 and 230-231; Olivier Corten, *The Law Against War* (Oregon, Hart Publishing, 2002) 183-186.\n The Corfu Channel Case (United Kingdom v Albania) [1949] ICJ Rep 4, 22.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2593868\nESIL CONFERENCE PAPER SERIES\n[VOL. 4 NO 16]\nterritory directed towards the commission of [civil strife or terrorism in another State]. Concerning cyber attacks, the 2001 Resolution on Combating the Criminal Misuse of Information Technologies calls upon States to prevent their territories from being used as a safe haven from which to launch cyber attacks, and to cooperate in the investigation and prosecution of such attacks. It is now widely recognised that a State has a positive customary obligation of due diligence to prevent the commission of unlawful activities from within its territory or any area under its exclusive control against another State. In particular, a State should take necessary and reasonable measures to prevent non-State actors using its internet gateways to perpetrate computer network attacks against another State. A State must not knowingly permit its territory or any other space under its exclusive control to be used as a sanctuary for cyber actors bent on attacking targets in another country. When a State is unable to meet its obligation to prevent such action, either because it lacks the territorial control necessary to do so, or because it does not have the human or logistical resources available, it is under an obligation to seek assistance in preventing cyber attacks. If a State fails to seek such assistance, this should be interpreted as an unwillingness to meet its obligation to prevent cyber attacks against other States from its territory. The unwillingness of a State to perform its obligation to counter international offensive cyber operations does not trigger the right to self-defence of the victim State, but nevertheless does engage the international responsibility of the relevant State. For instance, if States were unable to attribute to Russia the cyber attacks against Estonia in 2007, but this State is nevertheless suspected of tolerating the private groups, as authors of the cyber attacks, that engages its international responsibility.\nIn the opinion of this author, the law on self-defence should change. When a State infringes its obligation to prevent unlawful acts against another State committed on its territory or in an area under its exclusive control, and knowingly harbours a group preparing and perpetrating cyber attacks equivalent to armed attacks, this author argues that the State forfeits its right to territorial integrity. In this scenario, State practice should evolve so as to entitle the State victim of a cyber attack to use force in self-defence against the author of the cyber attack. The host State should, however, be given the opportunity to comply with its obligation to prevent international cyber offensives before there is a resort to action in self-defence. If international cyber attacks whose level is similar to that of armed attacks are prepared and committed from the territory of a failed State, then in this situation too, the victim State should have the right to self-defence against the cyber attackers. Indeed, if a State persists in not attempting to prevent cyber attacks equivalent to\n Declaration on Principles of International Law Concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation Among States in Accordance with the Charter of the United Nations (n 21) para. 1.\n GA Res 55/63 (22 January 2001), UN Doc A/RES/55/63, para. 1.\n Jeffrey Carr, Inside Cyber Warfare: Mapping the Cyber Underworld (2ⁿᵈ ed, Sebastopol, O’Reilly, 2013) 62-67; David E Graham, ‘Cyber Threats and the Law of War’ (2010) 4 Journal of National Security Law and Policy 87, 93-94.\n Kimberley N Trapp, ‘Back to Basics: Necessity, Proportionality and the Right of Self-Defence Against Non-State Terrorist Actors’ (2007) 56 ICLQ 147.\n Ruys and Verhoeven (n 69) 306.

The requirement of the necessity of the use of the right to self-defence is thus fulfilled.\nIn order to be more effective in response to international severe cyber attacks, a broader consensus in the international community should emerge towards the legality of the use of force in self-defence against cyber attackers committing cyber attacks equivalent to armed attacks and located in another State that does not prevent such attacks. The rationale behind this proposal is that the victim State should be entitled to engage in measures of prevention and suppression of cyber attacks which the host State should have performed itself. Therefore, the victim State should only target the cyber attackers and should not be allowed to react in self-defence against institutions of the host State. Furthermore, in the opinion of this author, the provision by a State of a safe haven to a cyber attacker is not serious enough so as to constitute an armed attack, even if the safe haven is necessary for, for example, planning and organising a cyber attack amounted to an armed attack. To argue otherwise would increase too much the possibility of resort to the use of force in self-defence.\nThe obligation of a State to prevent the perpetration by territorial actors of cyber attacks against other States, especially if they reach the level of armed attacks, is to be implemented with due diligence. It does not require the prevention of every international offensive cyber action but the adoption of reasonable measures in the light of the circumstances in order to generally prevent international cyber attacks. To assess whether a State respects its obligation of due diligence in the prevention of international cyber attacks, it should be checked: whether there has been a continuous pattern of cyber attacks from the relevant State; whether the State criminalises the commission of cyber attacks; whether the State conducts detailed investigations into cyber attacks; whether the State prosecutes cyber attackers; and whether the State cooperates with the victim States' investigations and prosecutions of the cyber attackers, especially when it lacks the capacity to investigate and prosecute those who have committed the cyber attacks. A careful assessment of all these facts is needed in order not to over stretch the limits of self-defence. Resort to self-defence should here be a last means to react to cyber attacks.\n Ashley S Deeks, “‘Unwilling or Unable’: Toward a Normative Framework for Extraterritorial Self-Defence” (2012) 52 Virginia Journal of International Law 483, 494; Trapp (n 79) 142.\n Yoram Dinstein, War, Aggression and Self-Defence (4th ed, CUP, 2005) 245.\n Sonja Cenic, ‘State Responsibility and Self-Defence in International Law Post 9/11: Has the Scope of Article 51 of the United Nations Charter Been Widened as a Result of the US Response to 9/11?’ (2007) 14 Australian International Law Journal 201, 214-215.\n Graham (n 78)94.

Conclusion\nThe victim State of an international cyber attack could react within its right to self-defence if the cyber attack were attributable to a State and if the cyber attack had consequences similar to those of a traditional armed attack, namely severe material damage, human injury or human loss. Given the strict criteria governing the attribution of conduct to a State, most electronic attacks will not be attributable to a State. The current international right to self-defence does not, however, provide the State victim of a serious international computer network attack by a non-State actor with the legal possibility of reacting with force against that actor. Furthermore, it does not allow a reaction against a State that actively supports cyber attackers and provides financial, logistical or other support to them so that they are able to commit a cyber attack equivalent to an armed attack against another State. Finally, the current right to self-defence cannot be implemented against a State that harbours individuals or groups committing international cyber attacks from within its territory even if they amount to armed attacks. Therefore, the current international right to self-defence offers an incomplete and inadequate response to serious international cyber attacks.\nIn the opinion of this author, the law on self-defence should be amended and adapted to meet the distinctive challenges posed by severe international cyber attacks that are likely to be committed mostly by non-State actors. First, when a State provides practical assistance to a non-State organisation for the purpose of assisting it with the commission of a computer network attack against another State, similar to an armed attack, and when this assistance substantially contributes to the commission of the attack, State practice should change in such a way that the State is regarded as having committed an armed attack itself. In such a situation, the victim State should have the right to self-defence against the relevant State. Second, and this second scenario may occur more frequently than the first one, when a State knowingly harbours a non-State group preparing and perpetrating cyber attacks equivalent to armed attacks, it is here argued that it forfeits its right to territorial integrity. In this case, State practice should evolve so as to entitle the State victim of the cyber attacks to act in self-defence against the group - and only against it. In the exceptional situation when a cyber attack equivalent to an armed attack is committed against a State by a non-State actor based in the territory of a failed State, the victim State should also be allowed to implement its right to self-defence against the non-State actor. In all these circumstances, the action in self-defence could be traditional, and take a military form or cyber, and thus have effects similar to those of a forcible action in self-defence. The proposed changes in the implementation of the law to self-defence could occur through treaty law. However, it is unlikely that a majority of States will agree on a text governing reaction with force to cyber attacks in a near future, as there are fundamental differences between States on the interpretation on the international law on self-defence. It is therefore hoped that the proposed changes will emerge in customary international law through State practice.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2593868",

Introduction\nStates have become increasingly dependent on computers and the networks that connect them. The development of cyber space enables States and non-State actors to increase their offensive capabilities significantly. Cyber technology is now likely to become an essential offensive tool, in particular for terrorist organisations. It is even more the case that cyber attacks can be carried out more easily and with a lower risk of detection than attacks with conventional weapons: it is enough to have a computer and a connection to the internet. The concern that transnational terrorist or other non-State organisations may turn to cyber operations as a means of attacking States is well-founded. For instance, Al-Qaeda computers containing hacker tools have been seized and the membership of such a group has an increasing computer expertise. In his State of the Union Address of 2014, the President of the United States referred to the need to ‘...combat new threats like cyber attacks’. A cyber attack can be defined as a deliberate action ‘...taken through the use of computer networks to disrupt, deceive, degrade, manipulate or destroy information resident in the target information system or computer networks, or the systems/networks themselves’. Cyber attacks may produce effects that are not only internal to a\nThe term ‘non-State actor’ refers to terrorist groups, rebel groups, other organised groups and individuals.\nMichael N Schmitt, ‘Cyber Operations and the Jus Ad Bellum Revisited’ (2011-2012) 56 Villanova Law Review 569, 600.\n<http: 01=\"\" 2014=\"\" 28=\"\" president-barack-obamas-state-union-address=\"\" the-press-office=\"\" www.whitehouse.gov=\"\"> accessed 1 December 2014.\n<http: 2010-11-joint%20terminology%20for%20cyberspace%20operations.pdf=\"\" cyberreferencelib=\"\" www.nsci-va.org=\"\"> accessed 1 December 2014.\nElectronic copy available at: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2593868</http:></http:>\nESIL CONFERENCE PAPER SERIES\n[VOL. 4 NO 16]\ncomputer or network but also external, by causing harm to connected facilities which could in turn lead to serious physical harm to property or individuals. Such would be the case for example when a computer network attack disables an air traffic control system and, thereby, causes an airliner to crash, resulting in material and physical destruction. In other words, a cyber operation may treat the target computer or computer network as the conduit for an attack on a physical target.\nTo what extent does international law on self-defence allow a State to react to cyber attacks? To implement the rules on the right to self-defence may entail certain difficulties in view of the specific characteristics of cyber technology. In particular, given the fast and anonymous character of a cyber attack, it may be difficult to attribute it to the author of that attack. Section II of this paper will outline the international criteria for the attribution of a cyber operation to a State. Section III will argue that only cyber attacks reaching the level of an armed attack give the right to the victim State to use self-defence. Section IV will explain that the law on self-defence does not offer an effective response to cyber attacks because, as international law stands, only cyber attacks attributed to States trigger the right to self-defence. Section V concludes that current international law on self-defence needs to be adapted to meet the challenges posed by cyber attacks.\n# 2. The Difficult Attribution of a Cyber Attack\nA crucial issue in any response in self-defence to a cyber attack is first to identify the author of the attack against whom action can be taken. Attribution is necessary for the effectiveness as well as for the lawfulness of the counter-action. International law does not know any specific standards of evidence with regard to issues involving the use of armed force in self-defence. There is, however, a general agreement that the graver the charge the more confidence there must be in the evidence. Therefore, a State should determine with a high degree of confidence the identity of the author of a cyber attack before exercising its right to self-defence against it.\nThe author of a cyber attack may claim responsibility for it. For instance, a group that commits a cyber attack may claim credit for it in a message posted online or on a videotape given to the media. The style of a cyber attack may also help to identify the organisation responsible for it. Otherwise, attribution of a cyber attack is a complicated exercise because of the nature of the cyber domain. Not only must the attack be traced back to its source, i.e. to a computer, but the person who operated the computer must also be identified or his affiliation determined. Unlike the case of an attacker in the physical world, a cyber attacker has the ability to launch an attack anonymously. In particular, in order to hide the real origin of an attack, cyber attackers may route\n Separate Opinion of Judge Higgins in Case Concerning Oil Platforms (Islamic Republic of Iran v United States of America) [2003] ICJ Rep, paras. 30-39.\n Susan W Brenner, ‘At Light Speed: Attribution and Response to Cybercrime/Terrorism/Warfare’ (2007) 97 Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology 379, 408.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2593868\nESIL CONFERENCE PAPER SERIES\n[VOL. 4 NO 16]\nan attack through a number of servers based around the globe prior to hitting the target system. To trace back an attack through those computers will require assistance from government and civilian entities in the States in which the computers were used. It can take months before assistance from the relevant States is obtained and the attack tracked back to its true point of origin. A further issue in identifying the perpetrator of a cyber attack is caused by the volatility of electronic data, which may be altered, moved or deleted in seconds. Lastly, once the origin and the author of a damageable international cyber operation are known, it may be difficult to assess its real purpose. The cyber operation might not be hostile but attributable only to faulty software or to an accidental computer error or malfunction. In April and May 2007, Estonia’s digital infrastructure was the victim of a massive computer network attack. Distributed ‘denial of service’ attacks targeted Estonia’s web services and brought Estonian web traffic to a halt. Since Estonia heavily relied on internet services, the impact of the cyber assault was very inconvenient. Most of the attacks emanated from abroad, principally Russia. It could not, however, be firmly demonstrated that the Russian government either conducted or orchestrated them. The origin of the attacks was also traced to at least 177 other States. This example of cyber attacks from at least 178 countries shows how challenging it could be to attribute a cyber operation to its author. In order to be able to respond effectively to cyber attacks, States should continue their technically based effort to enhance the capacity to trace their source in real-time.\nIt is expected that most electronic attacks will be performed by non-State actors. They may also be committed by or on behalf of a State, as suspected of Russia. In that case, one would expect a State that commits a cyber attack to attempt to make it look like that of a hacker. Under international law, a cyber operation can be attributed to a State especially in the following four circumstances. The first is where a cyber act is performed by an organ of a State, for example a member of its armed forces. This conclusion does not change if the hacker is a civilian, non-military, organ of the State. In accordance with Article 4 of the 2001 Draft Articles of the International Law Commission that mostly codifies customary international law on the responsibility of States: ‘[t]he conduct of any State organ shall be considered an act of that State under international law, whether the organ exercises legislative, executive, judicial or any other functions...’. The second situation of attribution of a cyber act to a State is when the act is performed by a person or entity empowered by the State to exercise governmental authority. For instance, if a State charges a private defence company with elements of authority normally associated with the government and asks it to conduct cyber operations, these operations will be imputed to the State. The third scenario in which a cyber operation may be attributed to a State is where the acting entity did so under the instructions, direction or control of a State. Such would be the case if a State hires an individual or an organisation to commit a cyber attack. Article 8 of the Draft Articles on the Responsibility of States reads: ‘The conduct of a person or group of\nIbid, 409.\nIbid, 420.\nIbid, 434-435.\n Schmitt (n 2) 569-570.\nJason Barkham, ‘Information Warfare and International Law on the Use of Force’(2001-2002) 34 NYU Journal of International Law and Politics 57, 58-59.\nOfficial Records of the UN General Assembly, Fifty-Sixth Session, Supplement No. 10 (A/56/10), Chp.IVE.1.\nArticle 5 of the Draft Articles on the Responsibility of States, ibid.\n[4]\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2593868\nESIL CONFERENCE PAPER SERIES\n[VOL. 4 NO 16]\npersons shall be considered an act of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct. The degree of direction or control must be high, which means that the State should have effectively directed or controlled the specific cyber operation. The reality of the control exercised on the ground should be determined on a case-by-case basis. It has been argued that the technical difficulty of attributing cyber attacks could only be responded to effectively by using a lower threshold for attribution, namely the criterion of ‘overall control’ that covers the case where a State coordinates or helps in the general planning of the relevant operation. Such an approach would, however, extend the use of the right to self-defence in response to cyber attacks in a dangerous manner and should be rejected. Finally, in accordance with Article 11 of the Draft Articles on the Responsibility of States: ‘[c]onduct ...shall...be considered an act of that State under international law if and to the extent that the State acknowledges and adopts the conduct in question as its own’. In order to avoid counter-measures taken by the victim State, it is unlikely that a State will publicly acknowledge a cyber attack.\n# 3. The Qualification of a Cyber Attack as an Armed Attack\n## A. The Prohibition of Inter-State Armed Force\nArticle 2(4) of the UN Charter states: ‘All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations’. The mainstream view among States and international lawyers is that the ‘other manner’ language extends to any use of force not authorised by the Charter, even if it does not threaten the territorial integrity or the political independence of a State. Since the expression ‘force’ in Article 2(4) is not preceded by the adjective ‘armed’, the scope of the ‘force’ to which Article 2(4) refers remains unclear and, in particular, whether it extends to economic or political force. The expression ‘armed force’ appears elsewhere in the Charter (in paragraph 7 of the Preamble to the Charter as well as in Articles 41 and 46). Furthermore, the first and principal purpose of the United Nations is, according to Article 1(1) of the Charter, to maintain international peace. Therefore, the interpretation of Article 2(4) in the context of the UN Charter is that it forbids the use of inter-State armed force by States parties. The preparatory work of the UN Charter confirms the fact that the prohibition contained in Article 2(4) is concerned only with military force. This conclusion is corroborated by resolutions of the UN General Assembly that deal with issues of\n Ibid.\n *Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v United States)*[1986]ICJ Rep 14, para. 115.\n Scott J Shackelford, ‘From Nuclear War to Net War: Analogising Cyber Attacks in International Law’ (2009) 27 Berkeley Journal of International Law 192, 235.\n *Prosecutor v Dusko Tadic* (15 July 1994) Judgment Appeals Chamber ICTY, IT-94-1-A, para. 131.\n *Official Records of the UN General Assembly* (n 12).\n Albrecht Randelzhofer and Oliver Dörr, ‘Article 2(4)’ in Bruno Simma (ed), *The Charter of the United Nations* (Vol. I, 2ⁿᵈ ed, OUP, 2012) 215-216.\n *Documents of the United Nations Conference on International Organisation*, 1945, Vol. VI, 559 and 720.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2593868\nESIL CONFERENCE PAPER SERIES\n[VOL. 4 NO 16]\npeace and security and which received the consent of a high majority of the States members of the Assembly. International State practice also confirms a narrow scope of Article 2(4). In conclusion, the prohibition of the use of inter-State force in the UN Charter as well as in general public international law covers only armed force and not economic, political and other types of coercion, unless coupled with the use or at least the threat of armed force.\n## B. Is a Cyber Attack Armed Force?\nIs a cyber act equivalent to armed force prohibited by Article 2(4) of the UN Charter? This can be the case only if the act is committed by a State against another State. A cyber act of an individual or an entity that is not acting on behalf of a State is tried as criminal action even when the attacker acts from abroad and claims to be waging war against the victim State. Furthermore, in order to be covered by the prohibition of inter-State use of force, a cyber act must be similar to armed force. Neither the UN Charter nor the International Court of Justice provides a definition of ‘armed force’. ‘Armed’ can be defined as ‘[e]quipped with a weapon’ or ‘[i]nvolving the use of a weapon’. A weapon is ‘[a]n instrument used or designed to be used to injure or kill someone’. Or a weapon is ‘...a thing designed or used for inflicting bodily harm or physical damage’. In its Advisory Opinion on the Legality of the Use of Nuclear Weapons, the International Court of Justice stated that Article 2(4) of the UN Charter does ‘not refer to specific weapons’. It applies ‘...to any use of force, regardless of the weapons employed’. Therefore, should cyber technology be used to injure or kill, it should be regarded as a ‘weapon’.\nTwo main approaches can be adopted to determine whether a cyber attack constitutes ‘armed force’. The first approach is an ‘instrument-based’ one. Using this model, an assessment is made as to whether a cyber operation may intrinsically involve physical force like a conventional weapon. Physical force is traditionally understood as involving ‘...any explosive effect with shock waves and heat’. Cyber operations do not intrinsically imply such physical force and therefore the ‘instrument-based’ model does not fit them. The second approach is the ‘consequence-based’ approach. Here an assessment is made as to whether the overall effects of a computer network attack are equivalent to those of an attack using a traditional weapon. The ‘consequence-based’ approach regards as armed force the use of any new means that leads to serious destructive effects. It is more flexible than the ‘instrument-based’ approach and can adapt to the technical evolution of warfare. It allows the inclusion of certain cyber attacks in the notion of ‘armed force’ even if the drafters of the UN Charter did not think of this possibility in 1945 simply because it was then not technically possible. The ‘instrument-based’ approach has already been applied by Brownlie to biological and chemical devices. For him, when these agents are\n See in particular Declaration on Principles of International Law Concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation Among States in Accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, GA Res 2625 (24 October 1970), UN Doc A/Res/2625, Annex, para 1.\n Randelzhofer and Dörr (n 19) 209.\n Bryan A Garner (ed), *Black’s Law Dictionary* (8th ed, St Paul Minn, Thomson West, 2009) 115.\n Ibid, 1730.\n *Oxford Dictionary of English* (2nd ed, OUP, 2008) 1994.\n *Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons* (Advisory Opinion) [1996] ICJ Rep 226, para. 39.\n Ian Brownlie, *International Law and the Use of Force by States* (Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1963) 362.\n[6]\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2593868\nESIL CONFERENCE PAPER SERIES\n[VOL. 4 NO 16]\ndirectly used to destroy physical property and life, they are weapons involving a use of armed force. Similarly, under the ‘consequence-based’ approach cyber operations may cause damage to tangible property, injury (including illness) or death. There are many examples of computer network attacks that should be considered as armed force: a cyber attack on the controlling system of air or train traffic, causing the crash of a plane or a train; a cyber operation creating a hammering phenomenon in oil pipelines causing them to burst; a cyber attack that shuts down power to a hospital with no back-up generators, or disrupts emergency response communications systems; a cyber attack that incapacitates the computers that control oil refineries, leading to the release of deadly effluents; a cyber operation shutting down computers controlling waterworks and dams, generating flooding of inhabited regions; a cyber attack disabling the systems that control a reactor of a nuclear power plant, leading to the release of radioactive materials. In these different situations, the severity of the consequences of the cyber operation - material destruction, injuries and/or deaths - rises to a level equal to that of an attack with kinetic weapons. By contrast, a cyber attack that interferes with the computers through which financial transactions are recorded and settled, and that disrupts a State’s financial system, would not constitute armed force because there is no destruction of objects or human injury. In the opinion of this author, qualifying such a cyber operation as a use of force would depart too much from the traditional definition of force and therefore also of an armed attack - an armed attack being a severe use of force - and would thus expand too much the use of the right to self-defence in response to an armed attack. Like this author, a majority of commentators use the ‘consequence-based’ model and conclude that cyber operations committed with the intention to cause material destruction, injuries and/or deaths analogous to those produced by kinetic weapons are to be considered as armed force.\nThe appropriateness of the ‘consequence-based’ model is today confirmed by State views where several States regard cyber technology as a new form of warfare. By 2012, the 15 States with the biggest military budgets are all investing in offensive cyber capabilities. The United States, China, Iran, Israel and Russia have already introduced cyber technology into their military strategies and have established military units with specific cyber expertise.

In response to a UN General Assembly’s invitation to inform the UN Security Council on the States’ position regarding information security, the United Kingdom, Australia, the United States, and Iran expressly stated that international law on the use of force applies. States did not yet categorise empirical cases of cyber attacks as constituting a use of force. In particular, since they did not lead to material damage or injury, the massive distributed ‘denial of service’ attacks that targeted Estonia’s web servers in 2007 or similar attacks that targeted Georgia’s websites when Russian forces invaded South Ossetia in 2008 were not qualified by States as uses of force. More surprisingly, no State considered as a use of force the attack caused by the Stuxnet virus that damaged Iran’s centrifuges for uranium enrichment in Natanz in 2010. The reason may be that this attack was unprecedented - the first computer operation that successfully targeted an industry and caused material destruction beyond the computer system itself. In any case, States increasingly acknowledge the possibility of a categorisation of severe cyber attacks as a use of force, and may react differently if a cyber attack with consequences as severe or more severe than those of the Stuxnet attack occurs in the future.\nSome commentators have advanced another and third approach for categorising when a cyber attack is to be considered as a use of force, namely the ‘target-based’ or ‘strict liability’ approach. This approach treats any cyber attack against a critical national infrastructure as a use of force because of the possible severe effects if such an infrastructure is disabled. There are several issues with such an approach. First, there is no fixed international definition of the term ‘critical infrastructure’. States generally agree that critical infrastructures constitute services such as water distribution, health, energy, transportation, banking and finance. However, as long as this term is not precisely defined by treaty law, States can transform and extend this enumerative list as they wish. Secondly, and most importantly, the ‘target-based’ approach is dangerously overbroad. Indeed, it assumes that any critical infrastructure network penetration reveals hostile intent and justifies the use of the right to self-defence, including anticipatory self-defence, whatever the level of damage finally caused. Third, this approach is not supported by States views. For all these reasons, the ‘target-based’ approach is to be rejected.\n ‘Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunication in the Context of International Security’ (20 July 2010) UN Doc A/65/154, 15.\n Ibid, 6.\n Ibid, 18-19.\n Ibid, 12.\n Hathaway et al.

Is a Cyber Attack a Grave Form of Armed Force?\nIn accordance with Article 51 of the UN Charter, ‘[n]othing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations...’. This provision is also a part of customary international law. The bedrock principle of self-defence is that it may be invoked in response to an armed attack. The question is then whether a cyber attack can constitute an armed attack, triggering the victim State’s right to respond through self-defence. In its Nicaragua judgment, the International Court of Justice referred to Article 3(g) of the ‘Definition of Aggression’ appended to a resolution of the UN General Assembly as concerning an ‘armed attack’. The Court reaffirmed this approach in its Armed Activities judgment. The Definition of Aggression can thus be used to define the concept of armed attack. Article 2 of the Definition states that aggression is ‘...the use of armed force by a State against the sovereignty, territorial integrity or political independence of another State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Charter of the United Nations’. Its Article 3 provides examples of aggression that are widely accepted by the international community. The list, however, deals only with conventional armed attacks involving the use of kinetic force. Article 2 of the Definition also specifies that an act of aggression must be of ‘sufficient gravity’. Similarly, the International Court of Justice has stated that the ‘most grave forms of the use of force’ constitute armed attacks, not ‘less grave forms’. Therefore not every use of armed force is necessarily deemed an armed attack. The scope, duration and intensity of the armed force must be assessed to determine whether an armed attack has occurred. The restriction of the implementation of self-defence to the use of serious armed force expresses the UN Charter’s intent to limit inter-State force. Furthermore, for the International Court of Justice, an armed attack must be carried out ‘...with the specific intention of harming’. If these statements are applied to cyber operations, it appears that an intentional disruption of digitised communications that causes only a minor destruction of physical property will reach the level of armed force but not that of an armed attack. By contrast, when a cyber operation is perpetrated with the intention of seriously destroying physical property and/or injuring or killing persons, that operation will qualify as an armed attack. For instance, if a computer attack causes a wagon of a goods train to crash, this may be considered as an illegal use of armed force but is unlikely to be regarded as an armed attack. On the contrary, a computer attack that leads to the crash of several passenger trains would very likely be considered as an armed attack.

It remains up to State practice to determine what level of damage is required to allow the legal use of self-defence. In this author’s opinion, only a limited number of cyber attacks, those causing severe material destruction, injury or death, should be considered as armed attacks. Without any doubt, the examples involving oil pipelines and refineries, dams, nuclear power plants and so on - which were cited above as uses of armed force - should also be regarded as armed attacks.\nIt should be noted that State practice seems to evolve towards the recognition of the ‘accumulation of effects’ doctrine, according to which the accumulation of several attacks from the same originator that do not on their own achieve the threshold of an armed attack constitute an armed attack in combination. The United States and Israel in particular approve the ‘accumulation of effects’ theory. The International Court of Justice did not expressly pronounce on the matter, but equally seemed to have implicitly endorsed it. Such accumulation theory may, however, be abused in order to justify the recourse to force. It is argued that cyber attacks that do not reach the level of an armed attack individually can constitute an armed attack when aggregated only if they are related and only if they occur within a relative short period of time.\n# 4. The Inappropriate Law on Self-defence in Response to Cyber Attacks\n## A. Absence of a Right to Self-Defence Against Non-State Cyber Attackers\nArticle 51 of the UN Charter does not expressly require that an armed attack be committed by a State in order to trigger the right to self-defence.

Could the State victim of a cyber attack exercise its right to self-defence against a non-State actor author of the attack? The International Court of Justice clearly stated that the Charter only ‘...recognises the existence of an inherent right of self-defence in the case of armed attack by one State against another State’. In another case, it declined to elaborate on whether actions by non-State actors would constitute an armed attack that would trigger an armed defense response. States, in particular the United States and Israel, have sometimes used force against non-State actors. After the defeat of the Taliban regime in November 2001, action in self-defence of the United States and its allies was no longer directed against the State of Afghanistan, but solely against the Al-Qaeda terrorist organisation and Taliban forces. The legality of this action was not, at least at the beginning, contested. In 2006 Israel took self-defence action against Hezbollah in Lebanon, declaring that it was acting not against the State of Lebanon -to which it was not able to attribute Hezbollah’s conduct - but against Hezbollah itself. Although many States criticised the disproportionate way in which Israel exercised its right to self-defence, they accepted that Israel enjoyed such a right in reaction to the attacks of Hezbollah. When, in other precedents, States invoked the right to self-defence against non-State actors, in particular terrorist organisations, without showing any involvement of the State where they were based, third States were, however, reluctant to recognise the legality of the forcible action. In recent State practice, there is no general and clear approval of the legality of the right to self-defence against non-State actors. Therefore it can be concluded that customary international law has not broadened, at least not yet, the right to self-defence to encompass action against non-State actors, authors of a cyber attack or not. Indeed, to recognise a right to self-defence against a non-State actor would be an infringement of the fundamental international principle of the territorial integrity of the State where the non-State actor is based. Furthermore, this could lead to a risk of abuse. States might engage in military operations against non-State actors although law enforcement through international organs would be the more normatively appropriate reaction.\n## B. Absence of a Right to Self-Defence Against States Actively Supporting Non-State Cyber Attackers\nThe right to self-defence can be carried out against a State that commits a cyber operation similar to an armed attack. Does the right to self-defence also exist against a State that supports an offensive cyber act perpetrated by a non-State actor whose severity is equivalent to that of an\n Raphael Van Steenberghe, ‘Self-defence in Response to Attacks by Non-State Actors in the Light of Recent State Practice: A Step Forward?’ (2010) 23 Leiden Journal of International Law183, 198.\n Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (Advisory Opinion) [2004] ICJ Rep 136, para. 139.\n Case Concerning Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo (n 46) para,147.

Article 3(g) of the Definition of Aggression qualifies as an act of aggression that can also be seen as a case of an armed attack the substantial involvement of a State in one of the acts of aggression referred to by Paragraphs b) to f) of Article 3. If a State provides financial, technical or other material support (below the level of direction and control) to an organisation and if this support significantly helps the commission by that organisation of a cyber attack whose level is equivalent to that of an armed attack and that is directed against another State, is the support of the State in the commission of the armed attack a ‘substantial involvement’ that corresponds to an armed attack? The International Court of Justice advocated a strict interpretation of ‘substantial involvement’ and held that ‘...assistance to rebels in the form of provision of weapons or logistical or other support’ does not fall into the category of armed attack. This legal position does not seem to have changed since. In current State practice, the supply of money, arms and logistical help has rarely been regarded as armed attack. However, even if it does not constitute an armed attack, such a supply is illegal and engages the responsibility of the State under international law. Indeed, a State is bound by an obligation not to actively support damageable conduct of non-State actors directed against another State. Concerning for instance activities of terrorist non-State actors, the UN Security Council has stressed that ‘...every Member State has the duty to refrain from organising, instigating, assisting or participating in terrorist acts in another State or acquiescing in organised activities within its territory directed toward the commission of such acts’.\nIn the opinion of this author, the law on self-defence should evolve in order to offer a more efficient response to international offensive cyber operations. The concept of ‘substantial involvement’ should be reinterpreted and include a lesser degree of State involvement than the one that seems to be required by the International Court of Justice. When a State provides practical assistance to an organisation for the purpose of assisting it with the commission of a computer network attack against another State - similar to an armed attack - and when this assistance substantially contributes to the commission of the attack, State practice should change in such a way that the State is regarded as having committed an armed attack itself. In such a situation, the victim State should have the right to self-defence against the relevant State.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2593868\n Definition of Aggression (n 47).\n Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (n 15) para. 195.\n The case law of the Nicaragua case was confirmed in Case Concerning Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo (n 46) paras. 106-147.\n Gray (n 59) 132.\n Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (n 15) para.205.\n UNSC Res 1189 (1998) preamble, UN Doc S/RES/1189.\n In his dissenting opinion to the Nicaragua case, Judge Schwebel found that the concept of ‘substantial involvement’ could also include financial and logistical support.

Absence of a Right to Self-Defence Against States Passively Supporting Non-State Cyber Attackers\nAnother question is whether a State that simply tolerates computer network attacks which are as severe as armed attacks and are mounted from within its territory or an area under its exclusive control against another State can be regarded as perpetrating an armed attack itself? This question was asked most famously in relation to non-cyber activities, those of 11 September 2001 against the United States mounted by the Al-Qaeda terrorist organisation from within Taliban-led Afghanistan. Afghanistan had harboured Al-Qaeda, and had not complied with UN Security Council resolutions asking it to stop doing so. It did not, however, control the 11 September attacks. These attacks were clearly similar in scale and effect to an armed attack. The United States (supported by allies, in particular the United Kingdom) began a military action against the Al-Qaeda organisation and also against the State of Afghanistan from 7 October 2001. Both the United States and the United Kingdom reported to the UN Security Council that the military intervention was taken in accordance with their right to individual self-defence and to collective self-defence respectively. The UN Security Council recognised the existence of such a right to self-defence. The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation and the Organisation of American States also invoked the right to self-defence to assist the United States in its response to the attacks. Overall, the military action in self-defence against Afghanistan received massive support from the international community. Considering the international approval of the military intervention in Afghanistan, can one conclude that self-defence can be invoked against a State tolerating non-State actors' activities that amount to an armed attack? The problem is that it is impossible to adduce conclusive State practice and *opinio juris* - both of which are necessary for the emergence of a customary international rule in support of this argument - other than that showed in the Afghanistan case of 2001. Therefore, it is not enshrined in current customary international law that self-defence can be implemented against a State tolerating the organisation of non-State actors' attacks, cyber or not, against another State from within its territory or an area under its exclusive control.\nThe tolerance by a State of the organisation of international attacks from within its territory is, however, illegal as will be shown in the following analysis. In accordance with the International Court of Justice in the Corfu Channel case of 1949, every State is under an obligation ‘...not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States’. More specifically, the 1970 Declaration on Friendly Relations adopted by consensus by the UN General Assembly urges States to ‘...refrain from...acquiescing [in] organised activities within [their]\n Gray (n 59) 200-201.\n Letters of the Permanent Representatives of the United States and of the United Kingdom to the United Nations, UN Docs S/2001/946 and S/2001/947 respectively.\n UNSC Res 1368 (2001) preamble, UN Doc S/RES/1368 and UNSC Res 1373 (2001) preamble, UN Doc S/RES/1373.\n Gray (n 59) 193-194.\n Gray (n 59) 136-140 and 230-231; Olivier Corten, *The Law Against War* (Oregon, Hart Publishing, 2002) 183-186.\n The Corfu Channel Case (United Kingdom v Albania) [1949] ICJ Rep 4, 22.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2593868\nESIL CONFERENCE PAPER SERIES\n[VOL. 4 NO 16]\nterritory directed towards the commission of [civil strife or terrorism in another State]. Concerning cyber attacks, the 2001 Resolution on Combating the Criminal Misuse of Information Technologies calls upon States to prevent their territories from being used as a safe haven from which to launch cyber attacks, and to cooperate in the investigation and prosecution of such attacks. It is now widely recognised that a State has a positive customary obligation of due diligence to prevent the commission of unlawful activities from within its territory or any area under its exclusive control against another State. In particular, a State should take necessary and reasonable measures to prevent non-State actors using its internet gateways to perpetrate computer network attacks against another State. A State must not knowingly permit its territory or any other space under its exclusive control to be used as a sanctuary for cyber actors bent on attacking targets in another country. When a State is unable to meet its obligation to prevent such action, either because it lacks the territorial control necessary to do so, or because it does not have the human or logistical resources available, it is under an obligation to seek assistance in preventing cyber attacks. If a State fails to seek such assistance, this should be interpreted as an unwillingness to meet its obligation to prevent cyber attacks against other States from its territory. The unwillingness of a State to perform its obligation to counter international offensive cyber operations does not trigger the right to self-defence of the victim State, but nevertheless does engage the international responsibility of the relevant State. For instance, if States were unable to attribute to Russia the cyber attacks against Estonia in 2007, but this State is nevertheless suspected of tolerating the private groups, as authors of the cyber attacks, that engages its international responsibility.\nIn the opinion of this author, the law on self-defence should change. When a State infringes its obligation to prevent unlawful acts against another State committed on its territory or in an area under its exclusive control, and knowingly harbours a group preparing and perpetrating cyber attacks equivalent to armed attacks, this author argues that the State forfeits its right to territorial integrity. In this scenario, State practice should evolve so as to entitle the State victim of a cyber attack to use force in self-defence against the author of the cyber attack. The host State should, however, be given the opportunity to comply with its obligation to prevent international cyber offensives before there is a resort to action in self-defence. If international cyber attacks whose level is similar to that of armed attacks are prepared and committed from the territory of a failed State, then in this situation too, the victim State should have the right to self-defence against the cyber attackers. Indeed, if a State persists in not attempting to prevent cyber attacks equivalent to\n Declaration on Principles of International Law Concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation Among States in Accordance with the Charter of the United Nations (n 21) para. 1.\n GA Res 55/63 (22 January 2001), UN Doc A/RES/55/63, para. 1.\n Jeffrey Carr, Inside Cyber Warfare: Mapping the Cyber Underworld (2ⁿᵈ ed, Sebastopol, O’Reilly, 2013) 62-67; David E Graham, ‘Cyber Threats and the Law of War’ (2010) 4 Journal of National Security Law and Policy 87, 93-94.\n Kimberley N Trapp, ‘Back to Basics: Necessity, Proportionality and the Right of Self-Defence Against Non-State Terrorist Actors’ (2007) 56 ICLQ 147.\n Ruys and Verhoeven (n 69) 306.

The requirement of the necessity of the use of the right to self-defence is thus fulfilled.\nIn order to be more effective in response to international severe cyber attacks, a broader consensus in the international community should emerge towards the legality of the use of force in self-defence against cyber attackers committing cyber attacks equivalent to armed attacks and located in another State that does not prevent such attacks. The rationale behind this proposal is that the victim State should be entitled to engage in measures of prevention and suppression of cyber attacks which the host State should have performed itself. Therefore, the victim State should only target the cyber attackers and should not be allowed to react in self-defence against institutions of the host State. Furthermore, in the opinion of this author, the provision by a State of a safe haven to a cyber attacker is not serious enough so as to constitute an armed attack, even if the safe haven is necessary for, for example, planning and organising a cyber attack amounted to an armed attack. To argue otherwise would increase too much the possibility of resort to the use of force in self-defence.\nThe obligation of a State to prevent the perpetration by territorial actors of cyber attacks against other States, especially if they reach the level of armed attacks, is to be implemented with due diligence. It does not require the prevention of every international offensive cyber action but the adoption of reasonable measures in the light of the circumstances in order to generally prevent international cyber attacks. To assess whether a State respects its obligation of due diligence in the prevention of international cyber attacks, it should be checked: whether there has been a continuous pattern of cyber attacks from the relevant State; whether the State criminalises the commission of cyber attacks; whether the State conducts detailed investigations into cyber attacks; whether the State prosecutes cyber attackers; and whether the State cooperates with the victim States' investigations and prosecutions of the cyber attackers, especially when it lacks the capacity to investigate and prosecute those who have committed the cyber attacks. A careful assessment of all these facts is needed in order not to over stretch the limits of self-defence. Resort to self-defence should here be a last means to react to cyber attacks.\n Ashley S Deeks, “‘Unwilling or Unable’: Toward a Normative Framework for Extraterritorial Self-Defence” (2012) 52 Virginia Journal of International Law 483, 494; Trapp (n 79) 142.\n Yoram Dinstein, War, Aggression and Self-Defence (4th ed, CUP, 2005) 245.\n Sonja Cenic, ‘State Responsibility and Self-Defence in International Law Post 9/11: Has the Scope of Article 51 of the United Nations Charter Been Widened as a Result of the US Response to 9/11?’ (2007) 14 Australian International Law Journal 201, 214-215.\n Graham (n 78)94.

Conclusion\nThe victim State of an international cyber attack could react within its right to self-defence if the cyber attack were attributable to a State and if the cyber attack had consequences similar to those of a traditional armed attack, namely severe material damage, human injury or human loss. Given the strict criteria governing the attribution of conduct to a State, most electronic attacks will not be attributable to a State. The current international right to self-defence does not, however, provide the State victim of a serious international computer network attack by a non-State actor with the legal possibility of reacting with force against that actor. Furthermore, it does not allow a reaction against a State that actively supports cyber attackers and provides financial, logistical or other support to them so that they are able to commit a cyber attack equivalent to an armed attack against another State. Finally, the current right to self-defence cannot be implemented against a State that harbours individuals or groups committing international cyber attacks from within its territory even if they amount to armed attacks. Therefore, the current international right to self-defence offers an incomplete and inadequate response to serious international cyber attacks.\nIn the opinion of this author, the law on self-defence should be amended and adapted to meet the distinctive challenges posed by severe international cyber attacks that are likely to be committed mostly by non-State actors. First, when a State provides practical assistance to a non-State organisation for the purpose of assisting it with the commission of a computer network attack against another State, similar to an armed attack, and when this assistance substantially contributes to the commission of the attack, State practice should change in such a way that the State is regarded as having committed an armed attack itself. In such a situation, the victim State should have the right to self-defence against the relevant State. Second, and this second scenario may occur more frequently than the first one, when a State knowingly harbours a non-State group preparing and perpetrating cyber attacks equivalent to armed attacks, it is here argued that it forfeits its right to territorial integrity. In this case, State practice should evolve so as to entitle the State victim of the cyber attacks to act in self-defence against the group - and only against it. In the exceptional situation when a cyber attack equivalent to an armed attack is committed against a State by a non-State actor based in the territory of a failed State, the victim State should also be allowed to implement its right to self-defence against the non-State actor. In all these circumstances, the action in self-defence could be traditional, and take a military form or cyber, and thus have effects similar to those of a forcible action in self-defence. The proposed changes in the implementation of the law to self-defence could occur through treaty law. However, it is unlikely that a majority of States will agree on a text governing reaction with force to cyber attacks in a near future, as there are fundamental differences between States on the interpretation on the international law on self-defence. It is therefore hoped that the proposed changes will emerge in customary international law through State practice.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2593868"

The development of cyber space enables States and non-State actors to increase their offensive capabilities significantly. Cyber attacks can now be carried out more easily and with a lower risk of detection than attacks with conventional weapons. These attacks may produce effects that are not only internal to a computer or network but also external, by causing harm to connected facilities which could in turn lead to serious physical harm to property or individuals. Such would be the case for example when a computer network attack disables an air traffic control system and causes an airliner to crash. This paper addresses a number of challenges posed by cyber attacks to the law of self-defence. Section II outlines the international criteria for the attribution of a cyber operation to a State. Section III argues that only cyber attacks reaching the level of an armed attack give the right to the victim State to use self-defence. Section IV explains that the law on self-defence does not offer an effective response to cyber attacks because, as international law stands, only cyber attacks attributed to States trigger the right to self-defence. Section V concludes that current international law on self-defence needs to be adapted to meet the challenges posed by cyber attacks.\n**Keywords:** international law; cyber attacks; self-defence; attribution; armed attack.\n## Author Information:\nLecturer, University of Aberdeen.\nElectronic copy available at: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2593868\nESIL CONFERENCE PAPER SERIES\n[VOL. 4 No 16]\n# Contents\n1.

Introduction\nStates have become increasingly dependent on computers and the networks that connect them. The development of cyber space enables States and non-State actors to increase their offensive capabilities significantly¹. Cyber technology is now likely to become an essential offensive tool, in particular for terrorist organisations. It is even more the case that cyber attacks can be carried out more easily and with a lower risk of detection than attacks with conventional weapons: it is enough to have a computer and a connection to the internet. The concern that transnational terrorist or other non-State organisations may turn to cyber operations as a means of attacking States is well-founded. For instance, Al-Qaeda computers containing hacker tools have been seized and the membership of such a group has an increasing computer expertise². In his State of the Union Address of 2014, the President of the United States referred to the need to ‘...combat new threats like cyber attacks’³. A cyber attack can be defined as a deliberate action ‘...taken through the use of computer networks to disrupt, deceive, degrade, manipulate or destroy information resident in the target information system or computer networks, or the systems/networks themselves’⁴. Cyber attacks may produce effects that are not only internal to a\n¹The term ‘non-State actor’ refers to terrorist groups, rebel groups, other organised groups and individuals.\n²Michael N Schmitt, ‘Cyber Operations and the Jus Ad Bellum Revisited’ (2011-2012) 56 Villanova Law Review 569, 600.\n³<http: 01=\"\" 2014=\"\" 28=\"\" president-barack-obamas-state-union-address=\"\" the-press-office=\"\" www.whitehouse.gov=\"\"> accessed 1 December 2014.\n⁴<http: 2010-11-joint%20terminology%20for%20cyberspace%20operations.pdf=\"\" cyberreferencelib=\"\" www.nsci-va.org=\"\"> accessed 1 December 2014.\nElectronic copy available at: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2593868</http:></http:>\nESIL CONFERENCE PAPER SERIES\n[VOL. 4 NO 16]\ncomputer or network but also external, by causing harm to connected facilities which could in turn lead to serious physical harm to property or individuals. Such would be the case for example when a computer network attack disables an air traffic control system and, thereby, causes an airliner to crash, resulting in material and physical destruction. In other words, a cyber operation may treat the target computer or computer network as the conduit for an attack on a physical target.\nTo what extent does international law on self-defence allow a State to react to cyber attacks? To implement the rules on the right to self-defence may entail certain difficulties in view of the specific characteristics of cyber technology. In particular, given the fast and anonymous character of a cyber attack, it may be difficult to attribute it to the author of that attack. Section II of this paper will outline the international criteria for the attribution of a cyber operation to a State. Section III will argue that only cyber attacks reaching the level of an armed attack give the right to the victim State to use self-defence. Section IV will explain that the law on self-defence does not offer an effective response to cyber attacks because, as international law stands, only cyber attacks attributed to States trigger the right to self-defence. Section V concludes that current international law on self-defence needs to be adapted to meet the challenges posed by cyber attacks.\n# 2. The Difficult Attribution of a Cyber Attack\nA crucial issue in any response in self-defence to a cyber attack is first to identify the author of the attack against whom action can be taken. Attribution is necessary for the effectiveness as well as for the lawfulness of the counter-action. International law does not know any specific standards of evidence with regard to issues involving the use of armed force in self-defence. There is, however, a general agreement that the graver the charge the more confidence there must be in the evidence⁵. Therefore, a State should determine with a high degree of confidence the identity of the author of a cyber attack before exercising its right to self-defence against it.\nThe author of a cyber attack may claim responsibility for it. For instance, a group that commits a cyber attack may claim credit for it in a message posted online or on a videotape given to the media. The style of a cyber attack may also help to identify the organisation responsible for it⁶. Otherwise, attribution of a cyber attack is a complicated exercise because of the nature of the cyber domain. Not only must the attack be traced back to its source, i.e. to a computer, but the person who operated the computer must also be identified or his affiliation determined. Unlike the case of an attacker in the physical world, a cyber attacker has the ability to launch an attack anonymously. In particular, in order to hide the real origin of an attack, cyber attackers may route\n⁵ Separate Opinion of Judge Higgins in Case Concerning Oil Platforms (Islamic Republic of Iran v United States of America)  ICJ Rep, paras. 30-39.\n⁶ Susan W Brenner, ‘At Light Speed: Attribution and Response to Cybercrime/Terrorism/Warfare’ (2007) 97 Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology 379, 408.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2593868\nESIL CONFERENCE PAPER SERIES\n[VOL. 4 NO 16]\nan attack through a number of servers based around the globe prior to hitting the target system⁷. To trace back an attack through those computers will require assistance from government and civilian entities in the States in which the computers were used. It can take months before assistance from the relevant States is obtained and the attack tracked back to its true point of origin⁸. A further issue in identifying the perpetrator of a cyber attack is caused by the volatility of electronic data, which may be altered, moved or deleted in seconds. Lastly, once the origin and the author of a damageable international cyber operation are known, it may be difficult to assess its real purpose. The cyber operation might not be hostile but attributable only to faulty software or to an accidental computer error or malfunction⁹. In April and May 2007, Estonia’s digital infrastructure was the victim of a massive computer network attack. Distributed ‘denial of service’ attacks targeted Estonia’s web services and brought Estonian web traffic to a halt. Since Estonia heavily relied on internet services, the impact of the cyber assault was very inconvenient. Most of the attacks emanated from abroad, principally Russia. It could not, however, be firmly demonstrated that the Russian government either conducted or orchestrated them. The origin of the attacks was also traced to at least 177 other States¹⁰. This example of cyber attacks from at least 178 countries shows how challenging it could be to attribute a cyber operation to its author. In order to be able to respond effectively to cyber attacks, States should continue their technically based effort to enhance the capacity to trace their source in real-time.\nIt is expected that most electronic attacks will be performed by non-State actors¹¹. They may also be committed by or on behalf of a State, as suspected of Russia. In that case, one would expect a State that commits a cyber attack to attempt to make it look like that of a hacker. Under international law, a cyber operation can be attributed to a State especially in the following four circumstances. The first is where a cyber act is performed by an organ of a State, for example a member of its armed forces. This conclusion does not change if the hacker is a civilian, non-military, organ of the State. In accordance with Article 4 of the 2001 Draft Articles of the International Law Commission that mostly codifies customary international law on the responsibility of States: ‘[t]he conduct of any State organ shall be considered an act of that State under international law, whether the organ exercises legislative, executive, judicial or any other functions...’¹². The second situation of attribution of a cyber act to a State is when the act is performed by a person or entity empowered by the State to exercise governmental authority¹³. For instance, if a State charges a private defence company with elements of authority normally associated with the government and asks it to conduct cyber operations, these operations will be imputed to the State. The third scenario in which a cyber operation may be attributed to a State is where the acting entity did so under the instructions, direction or control of a State. Such would be the case if a State hires an individual or an organisation to commit a cyber attack. Article 8 of the Draft Articles on the Responsibility of States reads: ‘The conduct of a person or group of\n⁷Ibid, 409.\n⁸Ibid, 420.\n⁹Ibid, 434-435.\n¹⁰ Schmitt (n 2) 569-570.\n¹¹Jason Barkham, ‘Information Warfare and International Law on the Use of Force’(2001-2002) 34 NYU Journal of International Law and Politics 57, 58-59.\n¹²Official Records of the UN General Assembly, Fifty-Sixth Session, Supplement No. 10 (A/56/10), Chp.IVE.1.\n¹³Article 5 of the Draft Articles on the Responsibility of States, ibid.\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2593868\nESIL CONFERENCE PAPER SERIES\n[VOL. 4 NO 16]\npersons shall be considered an act of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct¹⁴. The degree of direction or control must be high, which means that the State should have effectively directed or controlled the specific cyber operation. The reality of the control exercised on the ground should be determined on a case-by-case basis¹⁵. It has been argued that the technical difficulty of attributing cyber attacks could only be responded to effectively by using a lower threshold for attribution¹⁶, namely the criterion of ‘overall control’ that covers the case where a State coordinates or helps in the general planning of the relevant operation¹⁷. Such an approach would, however, extend the use of the right to self-defence in response to cyber attacks in a dangerous manner and should be rejected. Finally, in accordance with Article 11 of the Draft Articles on the Responsibility of States: ‘[c]onduct ...shall...be considered an act of that State under international law if and to the extent that the State acknowledges and adopts the conduct in question as its own’¹⁸. In order to avoid counter-measures taken by the victim State, it is unlikely that a State will publicly acknowledge a cyber attack.\n# 3. The Qualification of a Cyber Attack as an Armed Attack\n## A. The Prohibition of Inter-State Armed Force\nArticle 2(4) of the UN Charter states: ‘All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations’. The mainstream view among States and international lawyers is that the ‘other manner’ language extends to any use of force not authorised by the Charter, even if it does not threaten the territorial integrity or the political independence of a State¹⁹. Since the expression ‘force’ in Article 2(4) is not preceded by the adjective ‘armed’, the scope of the ‘force’ to which Article 2(4) refers remains unclear and, in particular, whether it extends to economic or political force. The expression ‘armed force’ appears elsewhere in the Charter (in paragraph 7 of the Preamble to the Charter as well as in Articles 41 and 46). Furthermore, the first and principal purpose of the United Nations is, according to Article 1(1) of the Charter, to maintain international peace. Therefore, the interpretation of Article 2(4) in the context of the UN Charter is that it forbids the use of inter-State armed force by States parties. The preparatory work of the UN Charter confirms the fact that the prohibition contained in Article 2(4) is concerned only with military force²⁰. This conclusion is corroborated by resolutions of the UN General Assembly that deal with issues of\n¹⁴ Ibid.\n¹⁵ *Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v United States)*ICJ Rep 14, para. 115.\n¹⁶ Scott J Shackelford, ‘From Nuclear War to Net War: Analogising Cyber Attacks in International Law’ (2009) 27 Berkeley Journal of International Law 192, 235.\n¹⁷ *Prosecutor v Dusko Tadic* (15 July 1994) Judgment Appeals Chamber ICTY, IT-94-1-A, para. 131.\n¹⁸ *Official Records of the UN General Assembly* (n 12).\n¹⁹ Albrecht Randelzhofer and Oliver Dörr, ‘Article 2(4)’ in Bruno Simma (ed), *The Charter of the United Nations* (Vol. I, 2ⁿᵈ ed, OUP, 2012) 215-216.\n²⁰ *Documents of the United Nations Conference on International Organisation*, 1945, Vol. VI, 559 and 720.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2593868\nESIL CONFERENCE PAPER SERIES\n[VOL. 4 NO 16]\npeace and security and which received the consent of a high majority of the States members of the Assembly²¹. International State practice also confirms a narrow scope of Article 2(4)²². In conclusion, the prohibition of the use of inter-State force in the UN Charter as well as in general public international law covers only armed force and not economic, political and other types of coercion, unless coupled with the use or at least the threat of armed force.\n## B. Is a Cyber Attack Armed Force?\nIs a cyber act equivalent to armed force prohibited by Article 2(4) of the UN Charter? This can be the case only if the act is committed by a State against another State. A cyber act of an individual or an entity that is not acting on behalf of a State is tried as criminal action even when the attacker acts from abroad and claims to be waging war against the victim State. Furthermore, in order to be covered by the prohibition of inter-State use of force, a cyber act must be similar to armed force. Neither the UN Charter nor the International Court of Justice provides a definition of ‘armed force’. ‘Armed’ can be defined as ‘[e]quipped with a weapon’ or ‘[i]nvolving the use of a weapon’²³. A weapon is ‘[a]n instrument used or designed to be used to injure or kill someone’²⁴. Or a weapon is ‘...a thing designed or used for inflicting bodily harm or physical damage’²⁵. In its Advisory Opinion on the Legality of the Use of Nuclear Weapons, the International Court of Justice stated that Article 2(4) of the UN Charter does ‘not refer to specific weapons’. It applies ‘...to any use of force, regardless of the weapons employed’²⁶. Therefore, should cyber technology be used to injure or kill, it should be regarded as a ‘weapon’.\nTwo main approaches can be adopted to determine whether a cyber attack constitutes ‘armed force’. The first approach is an ‘instrument-based’ one. Using this model, an assessment is made as to whether a cyber operation may intrinsically involve physical force like a conventional weapon. Physical force is traditionally understood as involving ‘...any explosive effect with shock waves and heat’²⁷. Cyber operations do not intrinsically imply such physical force and therefore the ‘instrument-based’ model does not fit them. The second approach is the ‘consequence-based’ approach. Here an assessment is made as to whether the overall effects of a computer network attack are equivalent to those of an attack using a traditional weapon. The ‘consequence-based’ approach regards as armed force the use of any new means that leads to serious destructive effects. It is more flexible than the ‘instrument-based’ approach and can adapt to the technical evolution of warfare. It allows the inclusion of certain cyber attacks in the notion of ‘armed force’ even if the drafters of the UN Charter did not think of this possibility in 1945 simply because it was then not technically possible. The ‘instrument-based’ approach has already been applied by Brownlie to biological and chemical devices. For him, when these agents are\n²¹ See in particular Declaration on Principles of International Law Concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation Among States in Accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, GA Res 2625 (24 October 1970), UN Doc A/Res/2625, Annex, para 1.\n²² Randelzhofer and Dörr (n 19) 209.\n²³ Bryan A Garner (ed), *Black’s Law Dictionary* (8th ed, St Paul Minn, Thomson West, 2009) 115.\n²⁴ Ibid, 1730.\n²⁵ *Oxford Dictionary of English* (2nd ed, OUP, 2008) 1994.\n²⁶ *Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons* (Advisory Opinion)  ICJ Rep 226, para. 39.\n²⁷ Ian Brownlie, *International Law and the Use of Force by States* (Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1963) 362.\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2593868\nESIL CONFERENCE PAPER SERIES\n[VOL. 4 NO 16]\ndirectly used to destroy physical property and life, they are weapons involving a use of armed force²⁸. Similarly, under the ‘consequence-based’ approach cyber operations may cause damage to tangible property, injury (including illness) or death. There are many examples of computer network attacks that should be considered as armed force: a cyber attack on the controlling system of air or train traffic, causing the crash of a plane or a train²⁹; a cyber operation creating a hammering phenomenon in oil pipelines causing them to burst; a cyber attack that shuts down power to a hospital with no back-up generators, or disrupts emergency response communications systems; a cyber attack that incapacitates the computers that control oil refineries, leading to the release of deadly effluents; a cyber operation shutting down computers controlling waterworks and dams, generating flooding of inhabited regions; a cyber attack disabling the systems that control a reactor of a nuclear power plant, leading to the release of radioactive materials. In these different situations, the severity of the consequences of the cyber operation - material destruction, injuries and/or deaths - rises to a level equal to that of an attack with kinetic weapons. By contrast, a cyber attack that interferes with the computers through which financial transactions are recorded and settled, and that disrupts a State’s financial system, would not constitute armed force because there is no destruction of objects or human injury³⁰. In the opinion of this author, qualifying such a cyber operation as a use of force would depart too much from the traditional definition of force and therefore also of an armed attack - an armed attack being a severe use of force³¹ - and would thus expand too much the use of the right to self-defence in response to an armed attack. Like this author, a majority of commentators use the ‘consequence-based’ model and conclude that cyber operations committed with the intention to cause material destruction, injuries and/or deaths analogous to those produced by kinetic weapons are to be considered as armed force³².\nThe appropriateness of the ‘consequence-based’ model is today confirmed by State views where several States regard cyber technology as a new form of warfare. By 2012, the 15 States with the biggest military budgets are all investing in offensive cyber capabilities³³. The United States, China, Iran, Israel and Russia have already introduced cyber technology into their military strategies and have established military units with specific cyber expertise³⁴.

In response to a UN General Assembly’s invitation to inform the UN Security Council on the States’ position regarding information security, the United Kingdom³⁵, Australia³⁶, the United States³⁷, and Iran³⁸ expressly stated that international law on the use of force applies. States did not yet categorise empirical cases of cyber attacks as constituting a use of force. In particular, since they did not lead to material damage or injury, the massive distributed ‘denial of service’ attacks that targeted Estonia’s web servers in 2007 or similar attacks that targeted Georgia’s websites when Russian forces invaded South Ossetia in 2008 were not qualified by States as uses of force³⁹. More surprisingly, no State considered as a use of force the attack caused by the Stuxnet virus that damaged Iran’s centrifuges for uranium enrichment in Natanz in 2010⁴⁰. The reason may be that this attack was unprecedented - the first computer operation that successfully targeted an industry and caused material destruction beyond the computer system itself. In any case, States increasingly acknowledge the possibility of a categorisation of severe cyber attacks as a use of force, and may react differently if a cyber attack with consequences as severe or more severe than those of the Stuxnet attack occurs in the future.\nSome commentators have advanced another and third approach for categorising when a cyber attack is to be considered as a use of force, namely the ‘target-based’ or ‘strict liability’ approach⁴¹. This approach treats any cyber attack against a critical national infrastructure as a use of force because of the possible severe effects if such an infrastructure is disabled. There are several issues with such an approach. First, there is no fixed international definition of the term ‘critical infrastructure’. States generally agree that critical infrastructures constitute services such as water distribution, health, energy, transportation, banking and finance⁴². However, as long as this term is not precisely defined by treaty law, States can transform and extend this enumerative list as they wish. Secondly, and most importantly, the ‘target-based’ approach is dangerously overbroad. Indeed, it assumes that any critical infrastructure network penetration reveals hostile intent and justifies the use of the right to self-defence, including anticipatory self-defence, whatever the level of damage finally caused⁴³. Third, this approach is not supported by States views. For all these reasons, the ‘target-based’ approach is to be rejected.\n³⁵ ‘Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunication in the Context of International Security’ (20 July 2010) UN Doc A/65/154, 15.\n³⁶ Ibid, 6.\n³⁷ Ibid, 18-19.\n³⁸ Ibid, 12.\n³⁹ Hathaway et al.

Is a Cyber Attack a Grave Form of Armed Force?\nIn accordance with Article 51 of the UN Charter, ‘[n]othing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations...’. This provision is also a part of customary international law⁴⁴. The bedrock principle of self-defence is that it may be invoked in response to an armed attack. The question is then whether a cyber attack can constitute an armed attack, triggering the victim State’s right to respond through self-defence. In its Nicaragua judgment, the International Court of Justice referred to Article 3(g) of the ‘Definition of Aggression’ appended to a resolution of the UN General Assembly as concerning an ‘armed attack’⁴⁵. The Court reaffirmed this approach in its Armed Activities judgment⁴⁶. The Definition of Aggression can thus be used to define the concept of armed attack. Article 2 of the Definition states that aggression is ‘...the use of armed force by a State against the sovereignty, territorial integrity or political independence of another State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Charter of the United Nations’⁴⁷. Its Article 3 provides examples of aggression that are widely accepted by the international community. The list, however, deals only with conventional armed attacks involving the use of kinetic force. Article 2 of the Definition also specifies that an act of aggression must be of ‘sufficient gravity’. Similarly, the International Court of Justice has stated that the ‘most grave forms of the use of force’ constitute armed attacks, not ‘less grave forms’⁴⁸. Therefore not every use of armed force is necessarily deemed an armed attack. The scope, duration and intensity of the armed force must be assessed to determine whether an armed attack has occurred. The restriction of the implementation of self-defence to the use of serious armed force expresses the UN Charter’s intent to limit inter-State force. Furthermore, for the International Court of Justice, an armed attack must be carried out ‘...with the specific intention of harming’⁴⁹. If these statements are applied to cyber operations, it appears that an intentional disruption of digitised communications that causes only a minor destruction of physical property will reach the level of armed force but not that of an armed attack. By contrast, when a cyber operation is perpetrated with the intention of seriously destroying physical property and/or injuring or killing persons, that operation will qualify as an armed attack⁵⁰. For instance, if a computer attack causes a wagon of a goods train to crash, this may be considered as an illegal use of armed force but is unlikely to be regarded as an armed attack. On the contrary, a computer attack that leads to the crash of several passenger trains would very likely be considered as an armed attack. The fact that a cyber attack may reach the\n⁴⁴ Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (n 15) para. 176.\n⁴⁵ Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (n 15) para. 195.\n⁴⁶ Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo (Democratic Republic of the Congo v Uganda)  ICJ Rep 14, para. 146.\n⁴⁷ Definition of Aggression, GA Res 3314 (14 December 1974), UN Doc A/RES/3314.\n⁴⁸ Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (n 15) para. 191.\n⁴⁹ Case Concerning Oil Platforms (Islamic Republic of Iran v United States of America) ICJ Rep 161, para. 64.\n⁵⁰ Yoram Dinstein, ‘Computer Network Attacks and Self-Defence’ in Michael N Schmitt &amp; Brian T O’Donnell (eds), Computer Network Attack and International Law (Naval War College, International Law Studies, 2002) 105.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2593868\nESIL CONFERENCE PAPER SERIES\n[VOL. 4 NO 16]\nthreshold of an armed attack, triggering the right to self-defence, has been accepted by the heads of State and Government participating in the meeting of the North Atlantic Council in September 2014⁵¹. It remains up to State practice to determine what level of damage is required to allow the legal use of self-defence. In this author’s opinion, only a limited number of cyber attacks, those causing severe material destruction, injury or death, should be considered as armed attacks. Without any doubt, the examples involving oil pipelines and refineries, dams, nuclear power plants and so on - which were cited above as uses of armed force - should also be regarded as armed attacks.\nIt should be noted that State practice seems to evolve towards the recognition of the ‘accumulation of effects’ doctrine, according to which the accumulation of several attacks from the same originator that do not on their own achieve the threshold of an armed attack constitute an armed attack in combination⁵². The United States and Israel in particular approve the ‘accumulation of effects’ theory⁵³. The International Court of Justice did not expressly pronounce on the matter, but equally seemed to have implicitly endorsed it⁵⁴. Such accumulation theory may, however, be abused in order to justify the recourse to force. It is argued that cyber attacks that do not reach the level of an armed attack individually can constitute an armed attack when aggregated only if they are related and only if they occur within a relative short period of time.\n# 4. The Inappropriate Law on Self-defence in Response to Cyber Attacks\n## A. Absence of a Right to Self-Defence Against Non-State Cyber Attackers\nArticle 51 of the UN Charter does not expressly require that an armed attack be committed by a State in order to trigger the right to self-defence⁵⁵.

Could the State victim of a cyber attack exercise its right to self-defence against a non-State actor author of the attack? The International Court of Justice clearly stated that the Charter only ‘...recognises the existence of an inherent right of self-defence in the case of armed attack by one State against another State’⁵⁷. In another case, it declined to elaborate on whether actions by non-State actors would constitute an armed attack that would trigger an armed defense response⁵⁸. States, in particular the United States and Israel, have sometimes used force against non-State actors. After the defeat of the Taliban regime in November 2001, action in self-defence of the United States and its allies was no longer directed against the State of Afghanistan, but solely against the Al-Qaeda terrorist organisation and Taliban forces. The legality of this action was not, at least at the beginning, contested⁵⁹. In 2006 Israel took self-defence action against Hezbollah in Lebanon, declaring that it was acting not against the State of Lebanon -to which it was not able to attribute Hezbollah’s conduct - but against Hezbollah itself⁶⁰. Although many States criticised the disproportionate way in which Israel exercised its right to self-defence, they accepted that Israel enjoyed such a right in reaction to the attacks of Hezbollah⁶¹. When, in other precedents, States invoked the right to self-defence against non-State actors, in particular terrorist organisations, without showing any involvement of the State where they were based, third States were, however, reluctant to recognise the legality of the forcible action⁶². In recent State practice, there is no general and clear approval of the legality of the right to self-defence against non-State actors. Therefore it can be concluded that customary international law has not broadened, at least not yet, the right to self-defence to encompass action against non-State actors, authors of a cyber attack or not. Indeed, to recognise a right to self-defence against a non-State actor would be an infringement of the fundamental international principle of the territorial integrity of the State where the non-State actor is based. Furthermore, this could lead to a risk of abuse. States might engage in military operations against non-State actors although law enforcement through international organs would be the more normatively appropriate reaction.\n## B. Absence of a Right to Self-Defence Against States Actively Supporting Non-State Cyber Attackers\nThe right to self-defence can be carried out against a State that commits a cyber operation similar to an armed attack.

Article 3(g) of the Definition of Aggression qualifies as an act of aggression that can also be seen as a case of an armed attack the substantial involvement of a State in one of the acts of aggression referred to by Paragraphs b) to f) of Article 3⁶³. If a State provides financial, technical or other material support (below the level of direction and control) to an organisation and if this support significantly helps the commission by that organisation of a cyber attack whose level is equivalent to that of an armed attack and that is directed against another State, is the support of the State in the commission of the armed attack a ‘substantial involvement’ that corresponds to an armed attack? The International Court of Justice advocated a strict interpretation of ‘substantial involvement’ and held that ‘...assistance to rebels in the form of provision of weapons or logistical or other support’ does not fall into the category of armed attack⁶⁴. This legal position does not seem to have changed since⁶⁵. In current State practice, the supply of money, arms and logistical help has rarely been regarded as armed attack⁶⁶. However, even if it does not constitute an armed attack, such a supply is illegal and engages the responsibility of the State under international law. Indeed, a State is bound by an obligation not to actively support damageable conduct of non-State actors directed against another State⁶⁷. Concerning for instance activities of terrorist non-State actors, the UN Security Council has stressed that ‘...every Member State has the duty to refrain from organising, instigating, assisting or participating in terrorist acts in another State or acquiescing in organised activities within its territory directed toward the commission of such acts’⁶⁸.\nIn the opinion of this author, the law on self-defence should evolve in order to offer a more efficient response to international offensive cyber operations. The concept of ‘substantial involvement’ should be reinterpreted and include a lesser degree of State involvement than the one that seems to be required by the International Court of Justice. When a State provides practical assistance to an organisation for the purpose of assisting it with the commission of a computer network attack against another State - similar to an armed attack - and when this assistance substantially contributes to the commission of the attack, State practice should change in such a way that the State is regarded as having committed an armed attack itself⁶⁹. In such a situation, the victim State should have the right to self-defence against the relevant State.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2593868\n⁶³ Definition of Aggression (n 47).\n⁶⁴ Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (n 15) para. 195.\n⁶⁵ The case law of the Nicaragua case was confirmed in Case Concerning Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo (n 46) paras. 106-147.\n⁶⁶ Gray (n 59) 132.\n⁶⁷ Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (n 15) para.205.\n⁶⁸ UNSC Res 1189 (1998) preamble, UN Doc S/RES/1189.\n⁶⁹ In his dissenting opinion to the Nicaragua case, Judge Schwebel found that the concept of ‘substantial involvement’ could also include financial and logistical support.

Absence of a Right to Self-Defence Against States Passively Supporting Non-State Cyber Attackers\nAnother question is whether a State that simply tolerates computer network attacks which are as severe as armed attacks and are mounted from within its territory or an area under its exclusive control against another State can be regarded as perpetrating an armed attack itself? This question was asked most famously in relation to non-cyber activities, those of 11 September 2001 against the United States mounted by the Al-Qaeda terrorist organisation from within Taliban-led Afghanistan. Afghanistan had harboured Al-Qaeda, and had not complied with UN Security Council resolutions asking it to stop doing so. It did not, however, control the 11 September attacks⁷⁰. These attacks were clearly similar in scale and effect to an armed attack. The United States (supported by allies, in particular the United Kingdom) began a military action against the Al-Qaeda organisation and also against the State of Afghanistan from 7 October 2001. Both the United States and the United Kingdom reported to the UN Security Council that the military intervention was taken in accordance with their right to individual self-defence and to collective self-defence respectively⁷¹. The UN Security Council recognised the existence of such a right to self-defence⁷². The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation and the Organisation of American States also invoked the right to self-defence to assist the United States in its response to the attacks. Overall, the military action in self-defence against Afghanistan received massive support from the international community⁷³. Considering the international approval of the military intervention in Afghanistan, can one conclude that self-defence can be invoked against a State tolerating non-State actors' activities that amount to an armed attack? The problem is that it is impossible to adduce conclusive State practice and *opinio juris* - both of which are necessary for the emergence of a customary international rule in support of this argument - other than that showed in the Afghanistan case of 2001⁷⁴. Therefore, it is not enshrined in current customary international law that self-defence can be implemented against a State tolerating the organisation of non-State actors' attacks, cyber or not, against another State from within its territory or an area under its exclusive control.\nThe tolerance by a State of the organisation of international attacks from within its territory is, however, illegal as will be shown in the following analysis. In accordance with the International Court of Justice in the Corfu Channel case of 1949, every State is under an obligation ‘...not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States’⁷⁵. More specifically, the 1970 Declaration on Friendly Relations adopted by consensus by the UN General Assembly urges States to ‘...refrain from...acquiescing [in] organised activities within [their]\n⁷⁰ Gray (n 59) 200-201.\n⁷¹ Letters of the Permanent Representatives of the United States and of the United Kingdom to the United Nations, UN Docs S/2001/946 and S/2001/947 respectively.\n⁷² UNSC Res 1368 (2001) preamble, UN Doc S/RES/1368 and UNSC Res 1373 (2001) preamble, UN Doc S/RES/1373.\n⁷³ Gray (n 59) 193-194.\n⁷⁴ Gray (n 59) 136-140 and 230-231; Olivier Corten, *The Law Against War* (Oregon, Hart Publishing, 2002) 183-186.\n⁷⁵ The Corfu Channel Case (United Kingdom v Albania)  ICJ Rep 4, 22.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2593868\nESIL CONFERENCE PAPER SERIES\n[VOL. 4 NO 16]\nterritory directed towards the commission of [civil strife or terrorism in another State]⁷⁶. Concerning cyber attacks, the 2001 Resolution on Combating the Criminal Misuse of Information Technologies calls upon States to prevent their territories from being used as a safe haven from which to launch cyber attacks, and to cooperate in the investigation and prosecution of such attacks⁷⁷. It is now widely recognised that a State has a positive customary obligation of due diligence to prevent the commission of unlawful activities from within its territory or any area under its exclusive control against another State. In particular, a State should take necessary and reasonable measures to prevent non-State actors using its internet gateways to perpetrate computer network attacks against another State. A State must not knowingly permit its territory or any other space under its exclusive control to be used as a sanctuary for cyber actors bent on attacking targets in another country⁷⁸. When a State is unable to meet its obligation to prevent such action, either because it lacks the territorial control necessary to do so, or because it does not have the human or logistical resources available, it is under an obligation to seek assistance in preventing cyber attacks. If a State fails to seek such assistance, this should be interpreted as an unwillingness to meet its obligation to prevent cyber attacks against other States from its territory⁷⁹. The unwillingness of a State to perform its obligation to counter international offensive cyber operations does not trigger the right to self-defence of the victim State, but nevertheless does engage the international responsibility of the relevant State⁸⁰. For instance, if States were unable to attribute to Russia the cyber attacks against Estonia in 2007, but this State is nevertheless suspected of tolerating the private groups, as authors of the cyber attacks, that engages its international responsibility⁸¹.\nIn the opinion of this author, the law on self-defence should change. When a State infringes its obligation to prevent unlawful acts against another State committed on its territory or in an area under its exclusive control, and knowingly harbours a group preparing and perpetrating cyber attacks equivalent to armed attacks, this author argues that the State forfeits its right to territorial integrity. In this scenario, State practice should evolve so as to entitle the State victim of a cyber attack to use force in self-defence against the author of the cyber attack. The host State should, however, be given the opportunity to comply with its obligation to prevent international cyber offensives before there is a resort to action in self-defence. If international cyber attacks whose level is similar to that of armed attacks are prepared and committed from the territory of a failed State, then in this situation too, the victim State should have the right to self-defence against the cyber attackers. Indeed, if a State persists in not attempting to prevent cyber attacks equivalent to\n⁷⁶ Declaration on Principles of International Law Concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation Among States in Accordance with the Charter of the United Nations (n 21) para. 1.\n⁷⁷ GA Res 55/63 (22 January 2001), UN Doc A/RES/55/63, para. 1.\n⁷⁸ Jeffrey Carr, Inside Cyber Warfare: Mapping the Cyber Underworld (2ⁿᵈ ed, Sebastopol, O’Reilly, 2013) 62-67; David E Graham, ‘Cyber Threats and the Law of War’ (2010) 4 Journal of National Security Law and Policy 87, 93-94.\n⁷⁹ Kimberley N Trapp, ‘Back to Basics: Necessity, Proportionality and the Right of Self-Defence Against Non-State Terrorist Actors’ (2007) 56 ICLQ 147.\n⁸⁰ Ruys and Verhoeven (n 69) 306.

The requirement of the necessity of the use of the right to self-defence is thus fulfilled⁸².\nIn order to be more effective in response to international severe cyber attacks, a broader consensus in the international community should emerge towards the legality of the use of force in self-defence against cyber attackers committing cyber attacks equivalent to armed attacks and located in another State that does not prevent such attacks. The rationale behind this proposal is that the victim State should be entitled to engage in measures of prevention and suppression of cyber attacks which the host State should have performed itself. Therefore, the victim State should only target the cyber attackers and should not be allowed to react in self-defence against institutions of the host State⁸³. Furthermore, in the opinion of this author, the provision by a State of a safe haven to a cyber attacker is not serious enough so as to constitute an armed attack, even if the safe haven is necessary for, for example, planning and organising a cyber attack amounted to an armed attack. To argue otherwise would increase too much the possibility of resort to the use of force in self-defence⁸⁴.\nThe obligation of a State to prevent the perpetration by territorial actors of cyber attacks against other States, especially if they reach the level of armed attacks, is to be implemented with due diligence. It does not require the prevention of every international offensive cyber action but the adoption of reasonable measures in the light of the circumstances in order to generally prevent international cyber attacks. To assess whether a State respects its obligation of due diligence in the prevention of international cyber attacks, it should be checked: whether there has been a continuous pattern of cyber attacks from the relevant State; whether the State criminalises the commission of cyber attacks; whether the State conducts detailed investigations into cyber attacks; whether the State prosecutes cyber attackers; and whether the State cooperates with the victim States' investigations and prosecutions of the cyber attackers, especially when it lacks the capacity to investigate and prosecute those who have committed the cyber attacks⁸⁵. A careful assessment of all these facts is needed in order not to over stretch the limits of self-defence. Resort to self-defence should here be a last means to react to cyber attacks.\n⁸² Ashley S Deeks, “‘Unwilling or Unable’: Toward a Normative Framework for Extraterritorial Self-Defence” (2012) 52 Virginia Journal of International Law 483, 494; Trapp (n 79) 142.\n⁸³ Yoram Dinstein, War, Aggression and Self-Defence (4th ed, CUP, 2005) 245.\n⁸⁴ Sonja Cenic, ‘State Responsibility and Self-Defence in International Law Post 9/11: Has the Scope of Article 51 of the United Nations Charter Been Widened as a Result of the US Response to 9/11?’ (2007) 14 Australian International Law Journal 201, 214-215.\n⁸⁵ Graham (n 78)94.

Conclusion\nThe victim State of an international cyber attack could react within its right to self-defence if the cyber attack were attributable to a State and if the cyber attack had consequences similar to those of a traditional armed attack, namely severe material damage, human injury or human loss. Given the strict criteria governing the attribution of conduct to a State, most electronic attacks will not be attributable to a State. The current international right to self-defence does not, however, provide the State victim of a serious international computer network attack by a non-State actor with the legal possibility of reacting with force against that actor. Furthermore, it does not allow a reaction against a State that actively supports cyber attackers and provides financial, logistical or other support to them so that they are able to commit a cyber attack equivalent to an armed attack against another State. Finally, the current right to self-defence cannot be implemented against a State that harbours individuals or groups committing international cyber attacks from within its territory even if they amount to armed attacks. Therefore, the current international right to self-defence offers an incomplete and inadequate response to serious international cyber attacks.\nIn the opinion of this author, the law on self-defence should be amended and adapted to meet the distinctive challenges posed by severe international cyber attacks that are likely to be committed mostly by non-State actors. First, when a State provides practical assistance to a non-State organisation for the purpose of assisting it with the commission of a computer network attack against another State, similar to an armed attack, and when this assistance substantially contributes to the commission of the attack, State practice should change in such a way that the State is regarded as having committed an armed attack itself. In such a situation, the victim State should have the right to self-defence against the relevant State. Second, and this second scenario may occur more frequently than the first one, when a State knowingly harbours a non-State group preparing and perpetrating cyber attacks equivalent to armed attacks, it is here argued that it forfeits its right to territorial integrity. In this case, State practice should evolve so as to entitle the State victim of the cyber attacks to act in self-defence against the group - and only against it. In the exceptional situation when a cyber attack equivalent to an armed attack is committed against a State by a non-State actor based in the territory of a failed State, the victim State should also be allowed to implement its right to self-defence against the non-State actor. In all these circumstances, the action in self-defence could be traditional, and take a military form or cyber, and thus have effects similar to those of a forcible action in self-defence. The proposed changes in the implementation of the law to self-defence could occur through treaty law. However, it is unlikely that a majority of States will agree on a text governing reaction with force to cyber attacks in a near future, as there are fundamental differences between States on the interpretation on the international law on self-defence. It is therefore hoped that the proposed changes will emerge in customary international law through State practice.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2593868"

Introduction\nStates have become increasingly dependent on computers and the networks that connect them. The development of cyber space enables States and non-State actors to increase their offensive capabilities significantly¹. Cyber technology is now likely to become an essential offensive tool, in particular for terrorist organisations. It is even more the case that cyber attacks can be carried out more easily and with a lower risk of detection than attacks with conventional weapons: it is enough to have a computer and a connection to the internet. The concern that transnational terrorist or other non-State organisations may turn to cyber operations as a means of attacking States is well-founded. For instance, Al-Qaeda computers containing hacker tools have been seized and the membership of such a group has an increasing computer expertise². In his State of the Union Address of 2014, the President of the United States referred to the need to ‘...combat new threats like cyber attacks’³. A cyber attack can be defined as a deliberate action ‘...taken through the use of computer networks to disrupt, deceive, degrade, manipulate or destroy information resident in the target information system or computer networks, or the systems/networks themselves’⁴. Cyber attacks may produce effects that are not only internal to a\n¹The term ‘non-State actor’ refers to terrorist groups, rebel groups, other organised groups and individuals.\n²Michael N Schmitt, ‘Cyber Operations and the Jus Ad Bellum Revisited’ (2011-2012) 56 Villanova Law Review 569, 600.\n³<http: 01=\"\" 2014=\"\" 28=\"\" president-barack-obamas-state-union-address=\"\" the-press-office=\"\" www.whitehouse.gov=\"\"> accessed 1 December 2014.\n⁴<http: 2010-11-joint%20terminology%20for%20cyberspace%20operations.pdf=\"\" cyberreferencelib=\"\" www.nsci-va.org=\"\"> accessed 1 December 2014.\nElectronic copy available at: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2593868</http:></http:>\nESIL CONFERENCE PAPER SERIES\n[VOL. 4 NO 16]\ncomputer or network but also external, by causing harm to connected facilities which could in turn lead to serious physical harm to property or individuals. Such would be the case for example when a computer network attack disables an air traffic control system and, thereby, causes an airliner to crash, resulting in material and physical destruction. In other words, a cyber operation may treat the target computer or computer network as the conduit for an attack on a physical target.\nTo what extent does international law on self-defence allow a State to react to cyber attacks? To implement the rules on the right to self-defence may entail certain difficulties in view of the specific characteristics of cyber technology. In particular, given the fast and anonymous character of a cyber attack, it may be difficult to attribute it to the author of that attack. Section II of this paper will outline the international criteria for the attribution of a cyber operation to a State. Section III will argue that only cyber attacks reaching the level of an armed attack give the right to the victim State to use self-defence. Section IV will explain that the law on self-defence does not offer an effective response to cyber attacks because, as international law stands, only cyber attacks attributed to States trigger the right to self-defence. Section V concludes that current international law on self-defence needs to be adapted to meet the challenges posed by cyber attacks.\n# 2. The Difficult Attribution of a Cyber Attack\nA crucial issue in any response in self-defence to a cyber attack is first to identify the author of the attack against whom action can be taken. Attribution is necessary for the effectiveness as well as for the lawfulness of the counter-action. International law does not know any specific standards of evidence with regard to issues involving the use of armed force in self-defence. There is, however, a general agreement that the graver the charge the more confidence there must be in the evidence⁵. Therefore, a State should determine with a high degree of confidence the identity of the author of a cyber attack before exercising its right to self-defence against it.\nThe author of a cyber attack may claim responsibility for it. For instance, a group that commits a cyber attack may claim credit for it in a message posted online or on a videotape given to the media. The style of a cyber attack may also help to identify the organisation responsible for it⁶. Otherwise, attribution of a cyber attack is a complicated exercise because of the nature of the cyber domain. Not only must the attack be traced back to its source, i.e. to a computer, but the person who operated the computer must also be identified or his affiliation determined. Unlike the case of an attacker in the physical world, a cyber attacker has the ability to launch an attack anonymously. In particular, in order to hide the real origin of an attack, cyber attackers may route\n⁵ Separate Opinion of Judge Higgins in Case Concerning Oil Platforms (Islamic Republic of Iran v United States of America) [2003] ICJ Rep, paras. 30-39.\n⁶ Susan W Brenner, ‘At Light Speed: Attribution and Response to Cybercrime/Terrorism/Warfare’ (2007) 97 Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology 379, 408.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2593868\nESIL CONFERENCE PAPER SERIES\n[VOL. 4 NO 16]\nan attack through a number of servers based around the globe prior to hitting the target system⁷. To trace back an attack through those computers will require assistance from government and civilian entities in the States in which the computers were used. It can take months before assistance from the relevant States is obtained and the attack tracked back to its true point of origin⁸. A further issue in identifying the perpetrator of a cyber attack is caused by the volatility of electronic data, which may be altered, moved or deleted in seconds. Lastly, once the origin and the author of a damageable international cyber operation are known, it may be difficult to assess its real purpose. The cyber operation might not be hostile but attributable only to faulty software or to an accidental computer error or malfunction⁹. In April and May 2007, Estonia’s digital infrastructure was the victim of a massive computer network attack. Distributed ‘denial of service’ attacks targeted Estonia’s web services and brought Estonian web traffic to a halt. Since Estonia heavily relied on internet services, the impact of the cyber assault was very inconvenient. Most of the attacks emanated from abroad, principally Russia. It could not, however, be firmly demonstrated that the Russian government either conducted or orchestrated them. The origin of the attacks was also traced to at least 177 other States¹⁰. This example of cyber attacks from at least 178 countries shows how challenging it could be to attribute a cyber operation to its author. In order to be able to respond effectively to cyber attacks, States should continue their technically based effort to enhance the capacity to trace their source in real-time.\nIt is expected that most electronic attacks will be performed by non-State actors¹¹. They may also be committed by or on behalf of a State, as suspected of Russia. In that case, one would expect a State that commits a cyber attack to attempt to make it look like that of a hacker. Under international law, a cyber operation can be attributed to a State especially in the following four circumstances. The first is where a cyber act is performed by an organ of a State, for example a member of its armed forces. This conclusion does not change if the hacker is a civilian, non-military, organ of the State. In accordance with Article 4 of the 2001 Draft Articles of the International Law Commission that mostly codifies customary international law on the responsibility of States: ‘[t]he conduct of any State organ shall be considered an act of that State under international law, whether the organ exercises legislative, executive, judicial or any other functions...’¹². The second situation of attribution of a cyber act to a State is when the act is performed by a person or entity empowered by the State to exercise governmental authority¹³. For instance, if a State charges a private defence company with elements of authority normally associated with the government and asks it to conduct cyber operations, these operations will be imputed to the State. The third scenario in which a cyber operation may be attributed to a State is where the acting entity did so under the instructions, direction or control of a State. Such would be the case if a State hires an individual or an organisation to commit a cyber attack. Article 8 of the Draft Articles on the Responsibility of States reads: ‘The conduct of a person or group of\n⁷Ibid, 409.\n⁸Ibid, 420.\n⁹Ibid, 434-435.\n¹⁰ Schmitt (n 2) 569-570.\n¹¹Jason Barkham, ‘Information Warfare and International Law on the Use of Force’(2001-2002) 34 NYU Journal of International Law and Politics 57, 58-59.\n¹²Official Records of the UN General Assembly, Fifty-Sixth Session, Supplement No. 10 (A/56/10), Chp.IVE.1.\n¹³Article 5 of the Draft Articles on the Responsibility of States, ibid.\n[4]\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2593868\nESIL CONFERENCE PAPER SERIES\n[VOL. 4 NO 16]\npersons shall be considered an act of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct¹⁴. The degree of direction or control must be high, which means that the State should have effectively directed or controlled the specific cyber operation. The reality of the control exercised on the ground should be determined on a case-by-case basis¹⁵. It has been argued that the technical difficulty of attributing cyber attacks could only be responded to effectively by using a lower threshold for attribution¹⁶, namely the criterion of ‘overall control’ that covers the case where a State coordinates or helps in the general planning of the relevant operation¹⁷. Such an approach would, however, extend the use of the right to self-defence in response to cyber attacks in a dangerous manner and should be rejected. Finally, in accordance with Article 11 of the Draft Articles on the Responsibility of States: ‘[c]onduct ...shall...be considered an act of that State under international law if and to the extent that the State acknowledges and adopts the conduct in question as its own’¹⁸. In order to avoid counter-measures taken by the victim State, it is unlikely that a State will publicly acknowledge a cyber attack.\n# 3. The Qualification of a Cyber Attack as an Armed Attack\n## A. The Prohibition of Inter-State Armed Force\nArticle 2(4) of the UN Charter states: ‘All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations’. The mainstream view among States and international lawyers is that the ‘other manner’ language extends to any use of force not authorised by the Charter, even if it does not threaten the territorial integrity or the political independence of a State¹⁹. Since the expression ‘force’ in Article 2(4) is not preceded by the adjective ‘armed’, the scope of the ‘force’ to which Article 2(4) refers remains unclear and, in particular, whether it extends to economic or political force. The expression ‘armed force’ appears elsewhere in the Charter (in paragraph 7 of the Preamble to the Charter as well as in Articles 41 and 46). Furthermore, the first and principal purpose of the United Nations is, according to Article 1(1) of the Charter, to maintain international peace. Therefore, the interpretation of Article 2(4) in the context of the UN Charter is that it forbids the use of inter-State armed force by States parties. The preparatory work of the UN Charter confirms the fact that the prohibition contained in Article 2(4) is concerned only with military force²⁰. This conclusion is corroborated by resolutions of the UN General Assembly that deal with issues of\n¹⁴ Ibid.\n¹⁵ *Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v United States)*[1986]ICJ Rep 14, para. 115.\n¹⁶ Scott J Shackelford, ‘From Nuclear War to Net War: Analogising Cyber Attacks in International Law’ (2009) 27 Berkeley Journal of International Law 192, 235.\n¹⁷ *Prosecutor v Dusko Tadic* (15 July 1994) Judgment Appeals Chamber ICTY, IT-94-1-A, para. 131.\n¹⁸ *Official Records of the UN General Assembly* (n 12).\n¹⁹ Albrecht Randelzhofer and Oliver Dörr, ‘Article 2(4)’ in Bruno Simma (ed), *The Charter of the United Nations* (Vol. I, 2ⁿᵈ ed, OUP, 2012) 215-216.\n²⁰ *Documents of the United Nations Conference on International Organisation*, 1945, Vol. VI, 559 and 720.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2593868\nESIL CONFERENCE PAPER SERIES\n[VOL. 4 NO 16]\npeace and security and which received the consent of a high majority of the States members of the Assembly²¹. International State practice also confirms a narrow scope of Article 2(4)²². In conclusion, the prohibition of the use of inter-State force in the UN Charter as well as in general public international law covers only armed force and not economic, political and other types of coercion, unless coupled with the use or at least the threat of armed force.\n## B. Is a Cyber Attack Armed Force?\nIs a cyber act equivalent to armed force prohibited by Article 2(4) of the UN Charter? This can be the case only if the act is committed by a State against another State. A cyber act of an individual or an entity that is not acting on behalf of a State is tried as criminal action even when the attacker acts from abroad and claims to be waging war against the victim State. Furthermore, in order to be covered by the prohibition of inter-State use of force, a cyber act must be similar to armed force. Neither the UN Charter nor the International Court of Justice provides a definition of ‘armed force’. ‘Armed’ can be defined as ‘[e]quipped with a weapon’ or ‘[i]nvolving the use of a weapon’²³. A weapon is ‘[a]n instrument used or designed to be used to injure or kill someone’²⁴. Or a weapon is ‘...a thing designed or used for inflicting bodily harm or physical damage’²⁵. In its Advisory Opinion on the Legality of the Use of Nuclear Weapons, the International Court of Justice stated that Article 2(4) of the UN Charter does ‘not refer to specific weapons’. It applies ‘...to any use of force, regardless of the weapons employed’²⁶. Therefore, should cyber technology be used to injure or kill, it should be regarded as a ‘weapon’.\nTwo main approaches can be adopted to determine whether a cyber attack constitutes ‘armed force’. The first approach is an ‘instrument-based’ one. Using this model, an assessment is made as to whether a cyber operation may intrinsically involve physical force like a conventional weapon. Physical force is traditionally understood as involving ‘...any explosive effect with shock waves and heat’²⁷. Cyber operations do not intrinsically imply such physical force and therefore the ‘instrument-based’ model does not fit them. The second approach is the ‘consequence-based’ approach. Here an assessment is made as to whether the overall effects of a computer network attack are equivalent to those of an attack using a traditional weapon. The ‘consequence-based’ approach regards as armed force the use of any new means that leads to serious destructive effects. It is more flexible than the ‘instrument-based’ approach and can adapt to the technical evolution of warfare. It allows the inclusion of certain cyber attacks in the notion of ‘armed force’ even if the drafters of the UN Charter did not think of this possibility in 1945 simply because it was then not technically possible. The ‘instrument-based’ approach has already been applied by Brownlie to biological and chemical devices. For him, when these agents are\n²¹ See in particular Declaration on Principles of International Law Concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation Among States in Accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, GA Res 2625 (24 October 1970), UN Doc A/Res/2625, Annex, para 1.\n²² Randelzhofer and Dörr (n 19) 209.\n²³ Bryan A Garner (ed), *Black’s Law Dictionary* (8th ed, St Paul Minn, Thomson West, 2009) 115.\n²⁴ Ibid, 1730.\n²⁵ *Oxford Dictionary of English* (2nd ed, OUP, 2008) 1994.\n²⁶ *Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons* (Advisory Opinion) [1996] ICJ Rep 226, para. 39.\n²⁷ Ian Brownlie, *International Law and the Use of Force by States* (Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1963) 362.\n[6]\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2593868\nESIL CONFERENCE PAPER SERIES\n[VOL. 4 NO 16]\ndirectly used to destroy physical property and life, they are weapons involving a use of armed force²⁸. Similarly, under the ‘consequence-based’ approach cyber operations may cause damage to tangible property, injury (including illness) or death. There are many examples of computer network attacks that should be considered as armed force: a cyber attack on the controlling system of air or train traffic, causing the crash of a plane or a train²⁹; a cyber operation creating a hammering phenomenon in oil pipelines causing them to burst; a cyber attack that shuts down power to a hospital with no back-up generators, or disrupts emergency response communications systems; a cyber attack that incapacitates the computers that control oil refineries, leading to the release of deadly effluents; a cyber operation shutting down computers controlling waterworks and dams, generating flooding of inhabited regions; a cyber attack disabling the systems that control a reactor of a nuclear power plant, leading to the release of radioactive materials. In these different situations, the severity of the consequences of the cyber operation - material destruction, injuries and/or deaths - rises to a level equal to that of an attack with kinetic weapons. By contrast, a cyber attack that interferes with the computers through which financial transactions are recorded and settled, and that disrupts a State’s financial system, would not constitute armed force because there is no destruction of objects or human injury³⁰. In the opinion of this author, qualifying such a cyber operation as a use of force would depart too much from the traditional definition of force and therefore also of an armed attack - an armed attack being a severe use of force³¹ - and would thus expand too much the use of the right to self-defence in response to an armed attack. Like this author, a majority of commentators use the ‘consequence-based’ model and conclude that cyber operations committed with the intention to cause material destruction, injuries and/or deaths analogous to those produced by kinetic weapons are to be considered as armed force³².\nThe appropriateness of the ‘consequence-based’ model is today confirmed by State views where several States regard cyber technology as a new form of warfare. By 2012, the 15 States with the biggest military budgets are all investing in offensive cyber capabilities³³. The United States, China, Iran, Israel and Russia have already introduced cyber technology into their military strategies and have established military units with specific cyber expertise³⁴.

In response to a UN General Assembly’s invitation to inform the UN Security Council on the States’ position regarding information security, the United Kingdom³⁵, Australia³⁶, the United States³⁷, and Iran³⁸ expressly stated that international law on the use of force applies. States did not yet categorise empirical cases of cyber attacks as constituting a use of force. In particular, since they did not lead to material damage or injury, the massive distributed ‘denial of service’ attacks that targeted Estonia’s web servers in 2007 or similar attacks that targeted Georgia’s websites when Russian forces invaded South Ossetia in 2008 were not qualified by States as uses of force³⁹. More surprisingly, no State considered as a use of force the attack caused by the Stuxnet virus that damaged Iran’s centrifuges for uranium enrichment in Natanz in 2010⁴⁰. The reason may be that this attack was unprecedented - the first computer operation that successfully targeted an industry and caused material destruction beyond the computer system itself. In any case, States increasingly acknowledge the possibility of a categorisation of severe cyber attacks as a use of force, and may react differently if a cyber attack with consequences as severe or more severe than those of the Stuxnet attack occurs in the future.\nSome commentators have advanced another and third approach for categorising when a cyber attack is to be considered as a use of force, namely the ‘target-based’ or ‘strict liability’ approach⁴¹. This approach treats any cyber attack against a critical national infrastructure as a use of force because of the possible severe effects if such an infrastructure is disabled. There are several issues with such an approach. First, there is no fixed international definition of the term ‘critical infrastructure’. States generally agree that critical infrastructures constitute services such as water distribution, health, energy, transportation, banking and finance⁴². However, as long as this term is not precisely defined by treaty law, States can transform and extend this enumerative list as they wish. Secondly, and most importantly, the ‘target-based’ approach is dangerously overbroad. Indeed, it assumes that any critical infrastructure network penetration reveals hostile intent and justifies the use of the right to self-defence, including anticipatory self-defence, whatever the level of damage finally caused⁴³. Third, this approach is not supported by States views. For all these reasons, the ‘target-based’ approach is to be rejected.\n³⁵ ‘Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunication in the Context of International Security’ (20 July 2010) UN Doc A/65/154, 15.\n³⁶ Ibid, 6.\n³⁷ Ibid, 18-19.\n³⁸ Ibid, 12.\n³⁹ Hathaway et al.

Is a Cyber Attack a Grave Form of Armed Force?\nIn accordance with Article 51 of the UN Charter, ‘[n]othing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations...’. This provision is also a part of customary international law⁴⁴. The bedrock principle of self-defence is that it may be invoked in response to an armed attack. The question is then whether a cyber attack can constitute an armed attack, triggering the victim State’s right to respond through self-defence. In its Nicaragua judgment, the International Court of Justice referred to Article 3(g) of the ‘Definition of Aggression’ appended to a resolution of the UN General Assembly as concerning an ‘armed attack’⁴⁵. The Court reaffirmed this approach in its Armed Activities judgment⁴⁶. The Definition of Aggression can thus be used to define the concept of armed attack. Article 2 of the Definition states that aggression is ‘...the use of armed force by a State against the sovereignty, territorial integrity or political independence of another State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Charter of the United Nations’⁴⁷. Its Article 3 provides examples of aggression that are widely accepted by the international community. The list, however, deals only with conventional armed attacks involving the use of kinetic force. Article 2 of the Definition also specifies that an act of aggression must be of ‘sufficient gravity’. Similarly, the International Court of Justice has stated that the ‘most grave forms of the use of force’ constitute armed attacks, not ‘less grave forms’⁴⁸. Therefore not every use of armed force is necessarily deemed an armed attack. The scope, duration and intensity of the armed force must be assessed to determine whether an armed attack has occurred. The restriction of the implementation of self-defence to the use of serious armed force expresses the UN Charter’s intent to limit inter-State force. Furthermore, for the International Court of Justice, an armed attack must be carried out ‘...with the specific intention of harming’⁴⁹. If these statements are applied to cyber operations, it appears that an intentional disruption of digitised communications that causes only a minor destruction of physical property will reach the level of armed force but not that of an armed attack. By contrast, when a cyber operation is perpetrated with the intention of seriously destroying physical property and/or injuring or killing persons, that operation will qualify as an armed attack⁵⁰. For instance, if a computer attack causes a wagon of a goods train to crash, this may be considered as an illegal use of armed force but is unlikely to be regarded as an armed attack. On the contrary, a computer attack that leads to the crash of several passenger trains would very likely be considered as an armed attack. The fact that a cyber attack may reach the\n⁴⁴ Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (n 15) para. 176.\n⁴⁵ Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (n 15) para. 195.\n⁴⁶ Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo (Democratic Republic of the Congo v Uganda) [2005] ICJ Rep 14, para. 146.\n⁴⁷ Definition of Aggression, GA Res 3314 (14 December 1974), UN Doc A/RES/3314.\n⁴⁸ Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (n 15) para. 191.\n⁴⁹ Case Concerning Oil Platforms (Islamic Republic of Iran v United States of America)[2003] ICJ Rep 161, para. 64.\n⁵⁰ Yoram Dinstein, ‘Computer Network Attacks and Self-Defence’ in Michael N Schmitt &amp; Brian T O’Donnell (eds), Computer Network Attack and International Law (Naval War College, International Law Studies, 2002) 105.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2593868\nESIL CONFERENCE PAPER SERIES\n[VOL. 4 NO 16]\nthreshold of an armed attack, triggering the right to self-defence, has been accepted by the heads of State and Government participating in the meeting of the North Atlantic Council in September 2014⁵¹. It remains up to State practice to determine what level of damage is required to allow the legal use of self-defence. In this author’s opinion, only a limited number of cyber attacks, those causing severe material destruction, injury or death, should be considered as armed attacks. Without any doubt, the examples involving oil pipelines and refineries, dams, nuclear power plants and so on - which were cited above as uses of armed force - should also be regarded as armed attacks.\nIt should be noted that State practice seems to evolve towards the recognition of the ‘accumulation of effects’ doctrine, according to which the accumulation of several attacks from the same originator that do not on their own achieve the threshold of an armed attack constitute an armed attack in combination⁵². The United States and Israel in particular approve the ‘accumulation of effects’ theory⁵³. The International Court of Justice did not expressly pronounce on the matter, but equally seemed to have implicitly endorsed it⁵⁴. Such accumulation theory may, however, be abused in order to justify the recourse to force. It is argued that cyber attacks that do not reach the level of an armed attack individually can constitute an armed attack when aggregated only if they are related and only if they occur within a relative short period of time.\n# 4. The Inappropriate Law on Self-defence in Response to Cyber Attacks\n## A. Absence of a Right to Self-Defence Against Non-State Cyber Attackers\nArticle 51 of the UN Charter does not expressly require that an armed attack be committed by a State in order to trigger the right to self-defence⁵⁵.

Could the State victim of a cyber attack exercise its right to self-defence against a non-State actor author of the attack? The International Court of Justice clearly stated that the Charter only ‘...recognises the existence of an inherent right of self-defence in the case of armed attack by one State against another State’⁵⁷. In another case, it declined to elaborate on whether actions by non-State actors would constitute an armed attack that would trigger an armed defense response⁵⁸. States, in particular the United States and Israel, have sometimes used force against non-State actors. After the defeat of the Taliban regime in November 2001, action in self-defence of the United States and its allies was no longer directed against the State of Afghanistan, but solely against the Al-Qaeda terrorist organisation and Taliban forces. The legality of this action was not, at least at the beginning, contested⁵⁹. In 2006 Israel took self-defence action against Hezbollah in Lebanon, declaring that it was acting not against the State of Lebanon -to which it was not able to attribute Hezbollah’s conduct - but against Hezbollah itself⁶⁰. Although many States criticised the disproportionate way in which Israel exercised its right to self-defence, they accepted that Israel enjoyed such a right in reaction to the attacks of Hezbollah⁶¹. When, in other precedents, States invoked the right to self-defence against non-State actors, in particular terrorist organisations, without showing any involvement of the State where they were based, third States were, however, reluctant to recognise the legality of the forcible action⁶². In recent State practice, there is no general and clear approval of the legality of the right to self-defence against non-State actors. Therefore it can be concluded that customary international law has not broadened, at least not yet, the right to self-defence to encompass action against non-State actors, authors of a cyber attack or not. Indeed, to recognise a right to self-defence against a non-State actor would be an infringement of the fundamental international principle of the territorial integrity of the State where the non-State actor is based. Furthermore, this could lead to a risk of abuse. States might engage in military operations against non-State actors although law enforcement through international organs would be the more normatively appropriate reaction.\n## B. Absence of a Right to Self-Defence Against States Actively Supporting Non-State Cyber Attackers\nThe right to self-defence can be carried out against a State that commits a cyber operation similar to an armed attack. Does the right to self-defence also exist against a State that supports an offensive cyber act perpetrated by a non-State actor whose severity is equivalent to that of an\n⁵⁶ Raphael Van Steenberghe, ‘Self-defence in Response to Attacks by Non-State Actors in the Light of Recent State Practice: A Step Forward?’ (2010) 23 Leiden Journal of International Law183, 198.\n⁵⁷ Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (Advisory Opinion) [2004] ICJ Rep 136, para. 139.\n⁵⁸ Case Concerning Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo (n 46) para,147.

Article 3(g) of the Definition of Aggression qualifies as an act of aggression that can also be seen as a case of an armed attack the substantial involvement of a State in one of the acts of aggression referred to by Paragraphs b) to f) of Article 3⁶³. If a State provides financial, technical or other material support (below the level of direction and control) to an organisation and if this support significantly helps the commission by that organisation of a cyber attack whose level is equivalent to that of an armed attack and that is directed against another State, is the support of the State in the commission of the armed attack a ‘substantial involvement’ that corresponds to an armed attack? The International Court of Justice advocated a strict interpretation of ‘substantial involvement’ and held that ‘...assistance to rebels in the form of provision of weapons or logistical or other support’ does not fall into the category of armed attack⁶⁴. This legal position does not seem to have changed since⁶⁵. In current State practice, the supply of money, arms and logistical help has rarely been regarded as armed attack⁶⁶. However, even if it does not constitute an armed attack, such a supply is illegal and engages the responsibility of the State under international law. Indeed, a State is bound by an obligation not to actively support damageable conduct of non-State actors directed against another State⁶⁷. Concerning for instance activities of terrorist non-State actors, the UN Security Council has stressed that ‘...every Member State has the duty to refrain from organising, instigating, assisting or participating in terrorist acts in another State or acquiescing in organised activities within its territory directed toward the commission of such acts’⁶⁸.\nIn the opinion of this author, the law on self-defence should evolve in order to offer a more efficient response to international offensive cyber operations. The concept of ‘substantial involvement’ should be reinterpreted and include a lesser degree of State involvement than the one that seems to be required by the International Court of Justice. When a State provides practical assistance to an organisation for the purpose of assisting it with the commission of a computer network attack against another State - similar to an armed attack - and when this assistance substantially contributes to the commission of the attack, State practice should change in such a way that the State is regarded as having committed an armed attack itself⁶⁹. In such a situation, the victim State should have the right to self-defence against the relevant State.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2593868\n⁶³ Definition of Aggression (n 47).\n⁶⁴ Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (n 15) para. 195.\n⁶⁵ The case law of the Nicaragua case was confirmed in Case Concerning Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo (n 46) paras. 106-147.\n⁶⁶ Gray (n 59) 132.\n⁶⁷ Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (n 15) para.205.\n⁶⁸ UNSC Res 1189 (1998) preamble, UN Doc S/RES/1189.\n⁶⁹ In his dissenting opinion to the Nicaragua case, Judge Schwebel found that the concept of ‘substantial involvement’ could also include financial and logistical support.

Absence of a Right to Self-Defence Against States Passively Supporting Non-State Cyber Attackers\nAnother question is whether a State that simply tolerates computer network attacks which are as severe as armed attacks and are mounted from within its territory or an area under its exclusive control against another State can be regarded as perpetrating an armed attack itself? This question was asked most famously in relation to non-cyber activities, those of 11 September 2001 against the United States mounted by the Al-Qaeda terrorist organisation from within Taliban-led Afghanistan. Afghanistan had harboured Al-Qaeda, and had not complied with UN Security Council resolutions asking it to stop doing so. It did not, however, control the 11 September attacks⁷⁰. These attacks were clearly similar in scale and effect to an armed attack. The United States (supported by allies, in particular the United Kingdom) began a military action against the Al-Qaeda organisation and also against the State of Afghanistan from 7 October 2001. Both the United States and the United Kingdom reported to the UN Security Council that the military intervention was taken in accordance with their right to individual self-defence and to collective self-defence respectively⁷¹. The UN Security Council recognised the existence of such a right to self-defence⁷². The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation and the Organisation of American States also invoked the right to self-defence to assist the United States in its response to the attacks. Overall, the military action in self-defence against Afghanistan received massive support from the international community⁷³. Considering the international approval of the military intervention in Afghanistan, can one conclude that self-defence can be invoked against a State tolerating non-State actors' activities that amount to an armed attack? The problem is that it is impossible to adduce conclusive State practice and *opinio juris* - both of which are necessary for the emergence of a customary international rule in support of this argument - other than that showed in the Afghanistan case of 2001⁷⁴. Therefore, it is not enshrined in current customary international law that self-defence can be implemented against a State tolerating the organisation of non-State actors' attacks, cyber or not, against another State from within its territory or an area under its exclusive control.\nThe tolerance by a State of the organisation of international attacks from within its territory is, however, illegal as will be shown in the following analysis. In accordance with the International Court of Justice in the Corfu Channel case of 1949, every State is under an obligation ‘...not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States’⁷⁵. More specifically, the 1970 Declaration on Friendly Relations adopted by consensus by the UN General Assembly urges States to ‘...refrain from...acquiescing [in] organised activities within [their]\n⁷⁰ Gray (n 59) 200-201.\n⁷¹ Letters of the Permanent Representatives of the United States and of the United Kingdom to the United Nations, UN Docs S/2001/946 and S/2001/947 respectively.\n⁷² UNSC Res 1368 (2001) preamble, UN Doc S/RES/1368 and UNSC Res 1373 (2001) preamble, UN Doc S/RES/1373.\n⁷³ Gray (n 59) 193-194.\n⁷⁴ Gray (n 59) 136-140 and 230-231; Olivier Corten, *The Law Against War* (Oregon, Hart Publishing, 2002) 183-186.\n⁷⁵ The Corfu Channel Case (United Kingdom v Albania) [1949] ICJ Rep 4, 22.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2593868\nESIL CONFERENCE PAPER SERIES\n[VOL. 4 NO 16]\nterritory directed towards the commission of [civil strife or terrorism in another State]⁷⁶. Concerning cyber attacks, the 2001 Resolution on Combating the Criminal Misuse of Information Technologies calls upon States to prevent their territories from being used as a safe haven from which to launch cyber attacks, and to cooperate in the investigation and prosecution of such attacks⁷⁷. It is now widely recognised that a State has a positive customary obligation of due diligence to prevent the commission of unlawful activities from within its territory or any area under its exclusive control against another State. In particular, a State should take necessary and reasonable measures to prevent non-State actors using its internet gateways to perpetrate computer network attacks against another State. A State must not knowingly permit its territory or any other space under its exclusive control to be used as a sanctuary for cyber actors bent on attacking targets in another country⁷⁸. When a State is unable to meet its obligation to prevent such action, either because it lacks the territorial control necessary to do so, or because it does not have the human or logistical resources available, it is under an obligation to seek assistance in preventing cyber attacks. If a State fails to seek such assistance, this should be interpreted as an unwillingness to meet its obligation to prevent cyber attacks against other States from its territory⁷⁹. The unwillingness of a State to perform its obligation to counter international offensive cyber operations does not trigger the right to self-defence of the victim State, but nevertheless does engage the international responsibility of the relevant State⁸⁰. For instance, if States were unable to attribute to Russia the cyber attacks against Estonia in 2007, but this State is nevertheless suspected of tolerating the private groups, as authors of the cyber attacks, that engages its international responsibility⁸¹.\nIn the opinion of this author, the law on self-defence should change. When a State infringes its obligation to prevent unlawful acts against another State committed on its territory or in an area under its exclusive control, and knowingly harbours a group preparing and perpetrating cyber attacks equivalent to armed attacks, this author argues that the State forfeits its right to territorial integrity. In this scenario, State practice should evolve so as to entitle the State victim of a cyber attack to use force in self-defence against the author of the cyber attack. The host State should, however, be given the opportunity to comply with its obligation to prevent international cyber offensives before there is a resort to action in self-defence. If international cyber attacks whose level is similar to that of armed attacks are prepared and committed from the territory of a failed State, then in this situation too, the victim State should have the right to self-defence against the cyber attackers. Indeed, if a State persists in not attempting to prevent cyber attacks equivalent to\n⁷⁶ Declaration on Principles of International Law Concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation Among States in Accordance with the Charter of the United Nations (n 21) para. 1.\n⁷⁷ GA Res 55/63 (22 January 2001), UN Doc A/RES/55/63, para. 1.\n⁷⁸ Jeffrey Carr, Inside Cyber Warfare: Mapping the Cyber Underworld (2ⁿᵈ ed, Sebastopol, O’Reilly, 2013) 62-67; David E Graham, ‘Cyber Threats and the Law of War’ (2010) 4 Journal of National Security Law and Policy 87, 93-94.\n⁷⁹ Kimberley N Trapp, ‘Back to Basics: Necessity, Proportionality and the Right of Self-Defence Against Non-State Terrorist Actors’ (2007) 56 ICLQ 147.\n⁸⁰ Ruys and Verhoeven (n 69) 306.

The requirement of the necessity of the use of the right to self-defence is thus fulfilled⁸².\nIn order to be more effective in response to international severe cyber attacks, a broader consensus in the international community should emerge towards the legality of the use of force in self-defence against cyber attackers committing cyber attacks equivalent to armed attacks and located in another State that does not prevent such attacks. The rationale behind this proposal is that the victim State should be entitled to engage in measures of prevention and suppression of cyber attacks which the host State should have performed itself. Therefore, the victim State should only target the cyber attackers and should not be allowed to react in self-defence against institutions of the host State⁸³. Furthermore, in the opinion of this author, the provision by a State of a safe haven to a cyber attacker is not serious enough so as to constitute an armed attack, even if the safe haven is necessary for, for example, planning and organising a cyber attack amounted to an armed attack. To argue otherwise would increase too much the possibility of resort to the use of force in self-defence⁸⁴.\nThe obligation of a State to prevent the perpetration by territorial actors of cyber attacks against other States, especially if they reach the level of armed attacks, is to be implemented with due diligence. It does not require the prevention of every international offensive cyber action but the adoption of reasonable measures in the light of the circumstances in order to generally prevent international cyber attacks. To assess whether a State respects its obligation of due diligence in the prevention of international cyber attacks, it should be checked: whether there has been a continuous pattern of cyber attacks from the relevant State; whether the State criminalises the commission of cyber attacks; whether the State conducts detailed investigations into cyber attacks; whether the State prosecutes cyber attackers; and whether the State cooperates with the victim States' investigations and prosecutions of the cyber attackers, especially when it lacks the capacity to investigate and prosecute those who have committed the cyber attacks⁸⁵. A careful assessment of all these facts is needed in order not to over stretch the limits of self-defence. Resort to self-defence should here be a last means to react to cyber attacks.\n⁸² Ashley S Deeks, “‘Unwilling or Unable’: Toward a Normative Framework for Extraterritorial Self-Defence” (2012) 52 Virginia Journal of International Law 483, 494; Trapp (n 79) 142.\n⁸³ Yoram Dinstein, War, Aggression and Self-Defence (4th ed, CUP, 2005) 245.\n⁸⁴ Sonja Cenic, ‘State Responsibility and Self-Defence in International Law Post 9/11: Has the Scope of Article 51 of the United Nations Charter Been Widened as a Result of the US Response to 9/11?’ (2007) 14 Australian International Law Journal 201, 214-215.\n⁸⁵ Graham (n 78)94.

Conclusion\nThe victim State of an international cyber attack could react within its right to self-defence if the cyber attack were attributable to a State and if the cyber attack had consequences similar to those of a traditional armed attack, namely severe material damage, human injury or human loss. Given the strict criteria governing the attribution of conduct to a State, most electronic attacks will not be attributable to a State. The current international right to self-defence does not, however, provide the State victim of a serious international computer network attack by a non-State actor with the legal possibility of reacting with force against that actor. Furthermore, it does not allow a reaction against a State that actively supports cyber attackers and provides financial, logistical or other support to them so that they are able to commit a cyber attack equivalent to an armed attack against another State. Finally, the current right to self-defence cannot be implemented against a State that harbours individuals or groups committing international cyber attacks from within its territory even if they amount to armed attacks. Therefore, the current international right to self-defence offers an incomplete and inadequate response to serious international cyber attacks.\nIn the opinion of this author, the law on self-defence should be amended and adapted to meet the distinctive challenges posed by severe international cyber attacks that are likely to be committed mostly by non-State actors. First, when a State provides practical assistance to a non-State organisation for the purpose of assisting it with the commission of a computer network attack against another State, similar to an armed attack, and when this assistance substantially contributes to the commission of the attack, State practice should change in such a way that the State is regarded as having committed an armed attack itself. In such a situation, the victim State should have the right to self-defence against the relevant State. Second, and this second scenario may occur more frequently than the first one, when a State knowingly harbours a non-State group preparing and perpetrating cyber attacks equivalent to armed attacks, it is here argued that it forfeits its right to territorial integrity. In this case, State practice should evolve so as to entitle the State victim of the cyber attacks to act in self-defence against the group - and only against it. In the exceptional situation when a cyber attack equivalent to an armed attack is committed against a State by a non-State actor based in the territory of a failed State, the victim State should also be allowed to implement its right to self-defence against the non-State actor. In all these circumstances, the action in self-defence could be traditional, and take a military form or cyber, and thus have effects similar to those of a forcible action in self-defence. The proposed changes in the implementation of the law to self-defence could occur through treaty law. However, it is unlikely that a majority of States will agree on a text governing reaction with force to cyber attacks in a near future, as there are fundamental differences between States on the interpretation on the international law on self-defence. It is therefore hoped that the proposed changes will emerge in customary international law through State practice.\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2593868"

    "abstract": "States have become increasingly dependent on computers and the networks that connect them. The development of cyber space enables States and non-State actors to increase their offensive capabilities significantly. Cyber attacks can now be carried out more easily and with a lower risk of detection than attacks with conventional weapons. These attacks may produce effects that are not only internal to a computer or network but also external, by causing harm to connected facilities which could in turn lead to serious physical harm to property or individuals. Such would be the case for example when a computer network attack disables an air traffic control system and causes an airliner to crash. This paper addresses a number of challenges posed by cyber attacks to the law of self-defence. Section II outlines the international criteria for the attribution of a cyber operation to a State. Section III argues that only cyber attacks reaching the level of an armed attack give the right to the victim State to use self-defence. Section IV explains that the law on self-defence does not offer an effective response to cyber attacks because, as international law stands, only cyber attacks attributed to States trigger the right to self-defence. Section V concludes that current international law on self-defence needs to be adapted to meet the challenges posed by cyber attacks.
