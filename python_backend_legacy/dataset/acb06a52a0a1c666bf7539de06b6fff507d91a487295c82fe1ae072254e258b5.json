In contrast, the relevance of the non-intervention principle is accepted by states and raises less questions about the ‘territoriality’ or the ‘militarization’ of cyberspace. At first sight, it thus appears as a convenient source for the regulation of cyberthreats. However, the *Nicaragua* case also established a stringent test for a foreign interference to qualify as an unlawful intervention. First, it must bear ‘on matters in which each State is permitted, by the principle of State sovereignty to decide freely’ (ie the ‘domaine réservé’). Then, it must involve ‘methods of coercion in regard to such choices’. I contend that both criteria are maladjusted to address cyberthreats and must be reconceptualised. In fact, the *domaine réservé* describes domains where states are free from international rules. However, few domains, including electoral processes or main economic orientations, are totally isolated from international law. I thus argue that it must be reconceptualised into the so-called ‘domaine privilégié’. It consists of a domain with clear-cut contours, unaffected by the developments of international law, which encompasses the fundamental interests of a state and its population. Then, coercion describes situations where a state is compelled to act, or to refrain from acting, in a certain fashion. This traditional approach is also problematic, and I argue that coercion must be understood in terms of deprivation of control.\n\n## 1.

In fact, he considered that '[t]o ignore this doctrine is to undermine international order and to promote violence and bloodshed which may prove catastrophic in the end'. More than three decades later, international lawyers' attempts at regulating emerging technologies reveal that the 'principle' of non-intervention might be relevant in situations where there is no risk of 'bloodshed', in a world that lacks flesh and bones: cyberspace. In particular, there has been a renewed interest in this principle since the hack-and-leak operation that targeted the Democratic National Committee (DNC) in 2016 and the alleged interference of Russia in the US elections. If some commentators suggested that Moscow had 'cross[ed] a line', most experts nevertheless came to the conclusion that the so-called 'hack-and-leak' operations were not coercive, and did not constitute a prohibited intervention. The discomfort of the US government with describing this operation as a prohibited intervention was also clear.\n\nAs a matter of fact,\n\n1 Separate Opinion of President Nagendra Singh in Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v USA) (Judgment) [1986] ICJ Rep 14, 156.\n2 ibid.

First, ‘[a] prohibited intervention must … be one bearing on matters in which each State is permitted, by the principle of State sovereignty, to decide freely’.⁶ This concept is also known as the ‘domaine réservé’ (reserved domain) of the state. Secondly, a prohibited intervention must use ‘methods of coercion in regard to such choices, which must remain free ones’.⁷ It appears that under this stringent test, most cyber operations and attempts at influence will never qualify as prohibited interventions. According to most experts and as suggested above, the main reason is that ‘methods of coercion’ are lacking. I nevertheless argue that this is only part of the problem: in fact, both features are maladjusted to address the characteristics of cyberthreats. My main point, then, is that they must be reconceptualised, and that a new definition of non-intervention in the cyberspace context must be achieved. If we fail to do so, the principle of non-intervention will fall into disuse with regard to cyberthreats.

I also argue in favour of a balanced reinterpretation of the concept of coercion, in order to encompass serious forms of foreign meddling, which deprive actors of control and render them powerless. In the end, the proposed definition is that a prohibited intervention occurs whenever a state (or a non-state actor located in that state) is deprived of control over matters within the domaine privilégié, due to the deliberate action of another state (as evidenced prima facie by the characteristics of the malware used).\n\nAgainst this background, this article is structured as follows. In the next section, I explain that the principle of non-intervention is clearly applicable in cyberspace. I underline, in particular, that its application to cyberthreats is less controversial than other rules, namely sovereignty or the prohibition to use force—whose implementation in a 'digital' space instead of a 'physical' space remains disputed (Section 2). In the third section, I analyse what is domaine réservé and the reason why this concept is no longer adequate to address cyber activities. In particular, I raise doubts about the current integration of political processes and economic orientations within the domaine réservé, and I contend that it fails to protect those private actors that are vital to the social and cultural system of a state (such as press bodies). I then explain why the notion of domaine réservé should be replaced by the notion of domaine privilégié, what it means and how it would apply to cyberspace (Section 3). In the fourth section, I dwell on the concept of coercion and explain what it means. I underline that the traditional understanding of coercion fails to grasp situations where the state is deprived of its control, and I support a balanced reinterpretation of this concept (Section 4). Some conclusions are offered in the last section (Section 5).\n\n## 2.

Therefore, a state-sponsored activity can breach the principle of non-intervention, even in the absence of ground, air or naval operations on foreign territory.¹⁶ It is significant, in that sense, that the ICJ underlined that ‘[b]etween independent States, respect for territorial sovereignty is an essential foundation of international relations … and international law requires political integrity\n\n¹⁵ Nicaragua (n 1) para 205.\n\n¹⁶ It may be noted that some authors resort to a subtle distinction between ‘non-interference’ and ‘non-intervention’. For instance, Niki Aloupi supports a ‘distinction between non-intervention (territorial integrity) and non-interference (independence and autonomy)’, which is ‘theoretically clear’. See: N Aloupi, ‘The Right to Non-intervention and Non-interference’ (2015) 4(3) Cambridge Journal of International and Comparative Law 566, 572. According to Karine Bannelier and Théodore Christakis, non-intervention ‘refers to the protection of the territory of the State, of its dominium, and that its violation would therefore involve the carrying out of material operations in foreign territory’. In contrast, non-interference ‘would refer to interference, without the authorization of the State, in the sphere of the exercise of its national sovereign powers and would, therefore, affect the imperium of the State’. See: K Bannelier and T Christakis, Cyber-Attacks, Prevention-Reactions: The Role of States and Private Actors (Les Cahiers de la Revue Défense Nationale 2017) 43. See also: P-M Dupuy and Y Kerbrat, Droit International Public (Dalloz 2014), paras 117–19. Yet, and as noted by Michael Wood, ‘in most contexts, the two terms seem to be used interchangeably’. See: M Wood, ‘Non-intervention (Non-interference in Domestic Affairs)’ (Encyclopedia Princetoniensis) <https: 551=\"\" pesd.princeton.edu=\"\" node=\"\"> accessed 15 July 2020. According to some authors, the difference between an interference and an intervention lies elsewhere, in the fact that the sole intervention is coercive and consequently, unlawful. See: R Jennings and A Watts, Oppenheim’s International Law-Vol I: Peace (9th edn, OUP 2008) 432; C Henderson, The Use of Force and International Law (CUP 2018) 51; M Schmitt (ed), Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations (CUP 2017) 313. It may be noted that declarations and case law are of little help to cut a clear distinction between ‘non-intervention’ and ‘non-interference’. The blurring probably culminated in Declaration 2625, which is supposed to contain ‘principles of international law’. It indeed mentioned that ‘[n]o State or group of States has the right to intervene, directly or indirectly, for any reason whatever, in the internal or external affairs of any other State. Consequently, armed intervention and all other forms of interference or attempted threats against the personality of the State or against its political, economic and cultural elements, are in violation of international law.’ See: UNGA Res 2625. In 1986, the ICJ found that ‘[t]he principle of non-intervention involves the right of every sovereign State to conduct its affairs without outside interference’. See: Nicaragua (n 1) para 202. In 2005, the ICJ ruled that ‘Uganda had violated the sovereignty and also the territorial integrity of the DRC. Uganda’s actions equally constituted an interference in the internal affairs of the DRC … The unlawful military intervention by Uganda was of such a magnitude and duration that the Court consider[ed] it to be a grave violation’ of UN Charter’s art 2(4).

For the sake of clarity, I will use the term 'meddling' to describe 'the act of trying to change or have an influence on things that are not your responsibility', without a legal connotation. In contrast, I will use the term 'intervention' to describe those coercive—and unlawful—activities directed against the internal or external affairs of other states.\n\n# 3. A reconceptualisation of the domaine réservé\n\nIn this section, I will first explain the concept of domaine réservé, and why this old-fashioned concept is unsatisfactory in the digital era (Subsection 3A). To alleviate this problem, I argue in favour of a reconceptualisation of the concept into a domaine privilégié (Subsection 3B).\n\n# A. The concept of domaine réservé\n\nThe exact wording used by the ICJ in the Nicaragua case to address the first component of a prohibited intervention was the following:\n\n... the principle forbids all States or groups of States to intervene directly or indirectly in internal or external affairs of other States. A prohibited intervention must accordingly be one bearing on matters in which each State is permitted, by the principle of State sovereignty, to decide freely. One of these is the choice of a political, economic, social and cultural system, and the formulation of foreign policy.[19]\n\nThis condition is often reconciled with the notion of state domaine réservé, which 'describes areas where States are free from international obligations and regulation'.[20]\n\nThe challenge with the domaine réservé resides in its shifting contours. In fact, the Permanent Court of International Justice (PCIJ) underlined that '[t]he question whether a certain matter is or is not solely within the jurisdiction of a State [ie if it is part of the domaine réservé] is an essentially relative question; it depends on the development of international relations'.[21] However, few domains are now totally\n\n17 Nicaragua (n 1) para 202.\n18 Definition of 'meddling' (Cambridge Dictionary) <https: anglais=\"\" dictionary.cambridge.org=\"\" media=\"\" fr=\"\" meddling=\"\"> accessed 22 March 2020.\n19 Nicaragua (n 1) para 205.\n20 K Ziegler, 'Domaine Réservé' in Max Planck Encyclopaedia of Public International Law (2013) para 1.\n21 Nationality Decrees Issued in Tunis and Morocco on Nov. 8th, 1921 (Advisory Opinion) [1923] PCIJ Rep Series B No 4, 24.</https:>",

As a matter of fact, 'the real motive of the operation appears to have been an attempt to prevent the film's global distribution as well as an attempt to deter SPE and other studios from insulting the North Korean regime'.[35] It must be said that this attempt was partially successful, as SPE had to cancel the film's release.[36] This decision was criticised by President Obama himself, who declared:\n\n[w]e cannot have a society where some dictator someplace can start imposing censorship here in the United States ...

Alternatively, let us imagine that the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) launches a series of attacks against the movie industry in France, to protest the upcoming release of a similar comedy depicting the North Korean regime. They paralyse the movie industry, and studios experience significant economic losses. The goal is to put such pressure on the Minister of Culture that he is forced to refuse to grant the movie a ‘visa d’exploitation’ (ie the authorisation to broadcast a film).⁴⁰ If one admits that restrictions to the freedom of expression are still part of the domaine réservé—which is arguably not the case, as human rights conventions usually regulate this area⁴¹—these attacks are more likely to qualify as interventions because the private actor was only targeted to obtain something from the state. In fact, attacks against the movie industry or newspapers are on the rise, and the resort to ‘criminal hackers’ might just ‘provide a cheap and easy way of censoring the press’.⁴² To alleviate this risk, I suggest replacement of the old-fashioned concept of domaine réservé with the newer domaine privilégié.\n\n## B.

The early roots of this doctrine can be found in Hobbes’s writings,⁶¹ and it was theorised by authors such as Wolff and Vattel. Wolff considered that nations had a ‘duty of self-preservation’.⁶² Hence, ‘every nation ha[d] the right to those means by which it can, as far as possible, avert the peril of destruction and avoid those things which can bring destruction upon it’.⁶³ Vattel defined certain ‘inalienable rights’ of nations, those required by ‘necessity’ or for its ‘preservation’—and their satisfaction usually justified the use of force.⁶⁴ Years later, Gidel thought that states had ‘fundamental’ or ‘inherent’ rights, which were ‘absolute, inviolable and unalienable’, and included ‘preservation, independence, equality, respect, international trade’.⁶⁵ Self-preservation actually gained a negative reputation,⁶⁶ as it was often ‘the criterion used to justify the rights of states to have recourse to arms’ and ‘for the violation of the rights of other subjects’.⁶⁷ Yet, literature of the post-war era reveals an alternative reading of self-preservation, which is more respectful of the rights of other states.

It then had the right to make use, ‘either by free consent or by force’, of ‘the ships, waggons, horses, or even the personal labour of foreigners’, and provided that it a ‘pressing want’ and pay ‘a compensation’ for them. Vattel also underlined this ‘right’ for ‘a nation of men’, to ‘procure women, who are absolutely necessary to its preservation’, and to use force if needed, and the right of foreigners to ‘mak[e] a settlement in the first country where they find land enough for themselves, without depriving the inhabitants of what is sufficient for them’.

Yet, in contrast with necessity or the early doctrine of self-preservation, it does not provide justification for breaching the rights of other states, but results in a duty of abstention: states must refrain from meddling with the domaine privilégié of other states. This domaine privilégié includes not only the elements necessary for the very survival of a state but also those that are essential for its independence, autonomy and stability.\n\nFirst, it protects the political organisation of the state, including the forms of government, the rule of law, personal, collective and political freedoms, as well as the electoral process in full (primary, local and general elections, referenda, etc). Under this new framework, the hack-and-leak operation that targeted the DNC would meddle with the American electoral process and, therefore, with the US domaine privilégié. It would also be affected in the event of cyber operations directed at the movie industry or press organs—like the SPE scenarios—as they seek to restrict the exercise of fundamental freedoms.\n\nSecondly, it encompasses internal and external security. For instance, the 2015 data breach at the US Office of Personnel Management (OPM) compromised the security of the USA, as it could 'reveal the identities of CIA [Central Intelligence Agency] operatives serving under diplomatic cover'.69 In this case, the domaine privilégié of the USA was obviously affected.\n\nThirdly, it incorporates major economic interests, ie 'interests so essential that a breach of them threatens the economic ... stability' of the state.70 Key and energy industries, major employers, transports, banking transactions and telecommunications may qualify as such. For instance, and considering that the petrochemical sector 'is a core part of the Saudi economy',71 the cyberattacks against oil companies in Saudi Arabia may affect its domaine privilégié. The same would be true for the 2017 NotPetya attacks, which were aimed at disrupting Ukraine's financial system.72 Insofar as they may provoke the downfall\n\n68 R Alfaro, 'The Rights and Duties of States' (1959) 97 Recueil des Cours 91, 112.\n69 E Nakashima, 'Hacks of OPM Databases Compromised 22.1 Million People, Federal Authorities Say' The Washington Post (9 July 2015) <www.washingtonpost.com 4=\"\" 4=\"\" 56.=\"\" [?utm_term=.b890029da58b=\"\" [?num_term=.b890029da58b=\"\" [?www.bis.cz=\"\" ]=\"\" accessed=\"\" and=\"\" are=\"\" as=\"\" atacks=\"\" be=\"\" been=\"\" by=\"\" c=\"\" c.=\"\" c.4=\"\" c.5=\"\" c.6=\"\" c.7=\"\" c.8=\"\" c.9=\"\" c.10=\"\" c.11=\"\" c.12=\"\" c.15=\"\" c.16.4=\"\" c.17=\"\" c.18.=\"\" c.2=\"\" c.3=\"\" c.4=\"\" c.5=\"\" c.6.=\"\" c.7=\"\" c.8.=\"\" c.9=\"\" c.100.=\"\" c.11=\"\" c.120.=\"\" c.13=\"\" c.14=\"\" c.15=\"\" c.16=\"\" c.17=\"\" c.18.=\"\" a=\"\" a.=\"\" a/cn.4=\"\" a/cp.10=\"\" a/p.10=\"\" a/=\"\" a/15=\"\" a/17=\"\" a/18=\"\" a/2015=\"\" a/2018=\"\" a/2018.=\"\" a/2020.=\"\" a/2020.=\"\" a/2020.=\"\" a/2020.=\"\" a/2020.=\"\" a/2020.=\"\" a/2020.=\"\" a/2020.=\"\" according=\"\" ac=\"\" acc.=\"\" against=\"\" a}=\"\" a}}=\"\" b=\"\" b.=\"\" b.10=\"\" b.11=\"\" b.12=\"\" b.15=\"\" b.17=\"\" b.18=\"\" b.2=\"\" b.3=\"\" b.4=\"\" b.5=\"\" b.6.=\"\" b.7=\"\" b.8=\"\" b.9=\"\" b.100=\"\" b.11=\"\" b.1200.=\"\" b.1200.=\"\" b.1200.=\"\" b.1200.=\"\" b.1200.=\"\" b.1200.",

A reconceptualisation of coercion\n\nIn this section, I will first explain the traditional definition of the concept of coercion, and why it is unsatisfactory in the digital era (Subsection 4A). I then put forward my own reappraisal of the concept of coercion (Subsection 4B).\n\n## A. The traditional definition of coercion\n\nCoercion must be equated with the implementation of ‘coercive measures’ or ‘coercive methods’ and must be distinguished from the mere influence or persuasion.⁷⁸ In fact, Vattel described interference as an ‘attempt to put a constraint on [the] deliberations’ of another state,⁷⁹ whereas Kant put down that ‘[n]o State shall by force interfere with the constitution or government of another State’.⁸⁰ The Montevideo Convention on the Rights and Duties of States of 1933 established a duty of non-recognition of situations ‘obtained by force whether this consist[ed] in the employment of arms, in threatening diplomatic representations, or in any other effective coercive measures’.⁸¹ The Charter of the Organization of American States (OAS) prevented states from ‘us[ing] or encouraging[ing] the use of coercive measures of an economic or political character in order to force the sovereign will of another state and obtain from it advantages of any kind’.⁸² It also underlined that ‘[n]o territorial acquisitions or special advantages obtained either by force or by other means of coercion shall be recognized’.⁸³ In the Nicaragua case, the ICJ used the term ‘methods of coercion’.⁸⁴ Another question that arises is whether intention is necessary. An analysis of the ICJ case law confirms that intention must be taken into account.⁸⁵\n\nAssemblée Nationale (France), ‘Première Séance Du Lundi 13 Avril 2015’ (13 April 2015) <www.assemblee-nationale.fr 14=\"\" 14-cri=\"\" 2014-2015=\"\" 20150212.asp#p511027=\"\"> accessed 13 February 2020.

As the Court noted in the Nicaragua case:\n\n... in international law, if one State, with a view to the coercion of another State, supports and assists armed bands in that State whose purpose is to overthrow the government of that State, that amounts to an intervention by the one State in the internal affairs of the other, whether or not the political objective of the State giving such support and assistance is equally far-reaching.⁸⁶\n\nIn fact, the Court did not find it necessary ‘to seek to establish whether the intention of the United States to secure a change of governmental policies in Nicaragua went so far as to be equated with an endeavour to overthrow the Nicaraguan Government’.⁸⁷ This criterion was not challenged by the judgment pertaining to the Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo.⁸⁸ It is true that the Court found that non-intervention was violated ‘even if the objectives of Uganda were not to overthrow President Kabila’, and were intended ‘to securing towns and airports for reason of its perceived security needs, and in support of the parallel activity of those engaged in civil war’.⁸⁹ Yet, this position may be explained by the fact that a prohibited use of force was also found.⁹⁰ In its traditional sense, coercion thus occurs when a state deploys those means of pressure against another state, which are of a sufficiently serious nature to, and with the intention to, compel the latter to act in a certain way—or to refrain from acting in a certain way—and against its own will.⁹¹ Coercion is not a result-\n\nS Watts, ‘Low-intensity Cyber Operations and the Principle of Non-intervention’ in JD Ohlin, K Govern and C Finkelstein (eds), *Cyber War: Law and Ethics for Virtual Conflicts* (OUP 2015) 268.\n\n⁸⁶ Nicaragua (n 1) para 241. ‘With a view to the coercion’ was translated in the French version into ‘exercer une pression’ (ie ‘put pressure’).\n\n⁸⁷ ibid. Yet, it was ‘clearly established’ that ‘the United States intended, by its support of the contras, to coerce the Government of Nicaragua’, and ‘that the intention of the contras themselves was to overthrow the present Government of Nicaragua’.\n\n⁸⁸ Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo (n 16).\n\n⁸⁹ ibid, para 163.\n\n⁹⁰ ibid, paras 164 and 165.\n\n⁹¹ ‘Coercion in inter-State relations involves the government of one State compelling the government of another State to think or act in a certain way by applying various kinds of pressure, threats, intimidation or the use of force’: C Joyner, ‘Coercion’ in R Wolfrum et al (eds), *Max Planck Encyclopaedia of Public International Law* (OUP, online edition, 2006) para 1. ‘Coercion’ is defined by the Black’s Law Dictionary as the ‘compulsion of a free agent by physical, moral, or economic force or threat of physical force’: definition of ‘coercion’, *Black’s Law Dictionary* (10th edn, 2014). The French translation—‘contrainte’—confirms this meaning and may be defined as follows: ‘[a]ction de contraindre, de forcer quelqu’un à agir contre sa volonté; pression morale ou physique, violence exercée sur lui.’ See: Definition of ‘contrainte’ (*Larousse*) &lt;www.larousse.fr/dictionnaires/francais/contrainte/18670#pWqM8QLtC0uMc51R.99&gt; accessed 26 March 2020.

For instance, the ICJ concluded in the Nicaragua case that the principle of non-intervention was breached by the USA even if the attempt at securing political change failed.⁹²\n\nThis understanding of coercion sets a high threshold and most cyber operations do not pass this test.⁹³ If a state was demanding another one to declare the wrong candidate a winner of the elections, or to declare the favourite candidate ineligible on false grounds, under the threat of launching a debilitating wave of cyberattacks, then the criterion of coercion would be met. Yet, it constitutes a textbook case which will rarely (if ever) happen in practice. In practice, democracy, freedom of expression or the proper functioning of infrastructures (among others) are hindered without a need for ‘compelling’ a state through the deployment of ‘coercive methods’. If Russia’s objective was to help Trump in the case of the DNC,⁹⁴ voters or the government were not ‘coerced’ stricto sensu. The former were given stolen information and fake news to persuade them to vote for Donald Trump—or ‘not vote at all’.⁹⁵ Then, state-sponsored attacks often take the form of ‘cyber-vandalism’ and would not pass the coercion test either. Let us take two actual examples of attacks against press organs. In April 2015, the French television network TV5Monde was the victim of a cyberattack directed by the so-called ‘CyberCaliphate’, who claimed to belong to the Islamic State.⁹⁶ The distribution of programmes was interrupted for hours.⁹⁷ Two months later, investigations revealed that the attack was more likely sponsored by Moscow and may constitute nothing more than an act of retaliation in reaction to the French and European measures adopted against\n\nPellet, Droit International Public (LGDJ 2009) 1025–26; Government (the Netherlands) (n 11).\n\n⁹² Nicaragua (n 1) para 292(3).\n\n⁹³ The USA, through the voice of Brian Egan, acknowledged that non-intervention was ‘generally viewed as a relatively narrow rule of customary international law …’.

State A makes a $85 million offer, whereas State B makes a $83 million offer. State A finally wins the contract, after making another offer: $82 million. State A was indeed obliged—due to the lower price proposed by State B—to change its position. Then, let us imagine that the companies based in ‘State D’ manufacture cars and sell them in large quantities abroad. A few years later, companies in ‘State E’ start manufacturing cars to a lower price, and the car industry collapses in State D, prompting the latter in renewing its economic or tax policies. State D indeed had—due to the economic emergence of State E—to review its policies. Let us take a third and last example. State F is a developing country that depends on foreign aid to fund the police. Following a wave of protest, the police in State F fires teargas and rubber bullets on demonstrators. State G—which is a donor—is shocked and decides to halt some aid. To remedy this situation, State F decides to cut education funding. In fact, State G prompted State F into changing its policies. If we equate ‘coercion’ with ‘influence’, these classical situations might result in prohibited interventions—and generate countermeasures in return.

I first read it in Harriet Moynihan’s paper, where this definition is discussed: H Moynihan, ‘The Application of International Law to State Cyberattacks’ (Chatham House, 2019) 40–43 <www.chathamhouse.org default=\"\" files=\"\" files/publications=\"\" research=\"\" sites=\"\" research/2019-11-29-intl-law-cyberattacks.pdf=\"\"> accessed 6 February 2020.

Describing ballot stuffing in terms of prohibited intervention is however not a new idea. In the 1980s, the US Congress highlighted that ‘[u]nilateral intervention in the internal affairs of other nations is antithetical to democracy. It contravenes international treaties and norms that are vital to the long-term peace and security of all nations in the Hemisphere. Intervention violates the right of self-determination which is the underpinning of every democracy.’ See: United States Congress House Committee on Appropriations Subcommittee on Foreign Operations and Related Agencies Appropriations, Foreign Assistance and Related Programs Appropriations for 1985: Hearings Before a Subcommittee of the Committee on Appropriations, House of Representatives, Ninety-Eighth Congress, Second Session (US Government Printing Office 1984) 662.

It means that a prohibited intervention occurs as soon as these two conditions are met, even if the victim failed to equip itself with state-of-the-art protections, or reacted too late—for instance, due to technical or bureaucratic reasons.

In my view, such applicability is welcomed by the international community and does not raise theoretical questions about the nature of sovereignty or the militarisation of cyberspace. However, I expressed fears that this principle becomes obsolete if we keep equating 'matters in which each State is permitted, by the principle of State sovereignty, to decide freely'¹¹⁹ with the notion of domaine réservé. I thus recommended that, for the purpose of non-intervention, we ought to adopt the notion of state domaine privilégié. The latter encompasses the political organisation of a state, its internal and external security, major economic interests and public services (including the health and social systems), as well as the preservation of a state's environment.

In contrast, the relevance of the non-intervention principle is accepted by states and raises less questions about the ‘territoriality’ or the ‘militarization’ of cyberspace. At first sight, it thus appears as a convenient source for the regulation of cyberthreats. However, the *Nicaragua* case also established a stringent test for a foreign interference to qualify as an unlawful intervention. First, it must bear ‘on matters in which each State is permitted, by the principle of State sovereignty to decide freely’ (ie the ‘domaine réservé’). Then, it must involve ‘methods of coercion in regard to such choices’. I contend that both criteria are maladjusted to address cyberthreats and must be reconceptualised. In fact, the *domaine réservé* describes domains where states are free from international rules. However, few domains, including electoral processes or main economic orientations, are totally isolated from international law. I thus argue that it must be reconceptualised into the so-called ‘domaine privilégié’. It consists of a domain with clear-cut contours, unaffected by the developments of international law, which encompasses the fundamental interests of a state and its population. Then, coercion describes situations where a state is compelled to act, or to refrain from acting, in a certain fashion. This traditional approach is also problematic, and I argue that coercion must be understood in terms of deprivation of control.\n## 1.

In fact, he considered that '[t]o ignore this doctrine is to undermine international order and to promote violence and bloodshed which may prove catastrophic in the end'. More than three decades later, international lawyers' attempts at regulating emerging technologies reveal that the 'principle' of non-intervention might be relevant in situations where there is no risk of 'bloodshed', in a world that lacks flesh and bones: cyberspace. In particular, there has been a renewed interest in this principle since the hack-and-leak operation that targeted the Democratic National Committee (DNC) in 2016 and the alleged interference of Russia in the US elections. If some commentators suggested that Moscow had 'cross[ed] a line', most experts nevertheless came to the conclusion that the so-called 'hack-and-leak' operations were not coercive, and did not constitute a prohibited intervention. The discomfort of the US government with describing this operation as a prohibited intervention was also clear.\nAs a matter of fact,\n1 Separate Opinion of President Nagendra Singh in Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v USA) (Judgment) [1986] ICJ Rep 14, 156.\n2 ibid.

First, ‘[a] prohibited intervention must … be one bearing on matters in which each State is permitted, by the principle of State sovereignty, to decide freely’.⁶ This concept is also known as the ‘domaine réservé’ (reserved domain) of the state. Secondly, a prohibited intervention must use ‘methods of coercion in regard to such choices, which must remain free ones’.⁷ It appears that under this stringent test, most cyber operations and attempts at influence will never qualify as prohibited interventions. According to most experts and as suggested above, the main reason is that ‘methods of coercion’ are lacking. I nevertheless argue that this is only part of the problem: in fact, both features are maladjusted to address the characteristics of cyberthreats. My main point, then, is that they must be reconceptualised, and that a new definition of non-intervention in the cyberspace context must be achieved. If we fail to do so, the principle of non-intervention will fall into disuse with regard to cyberthreats. I thus demonstrate that the old-fashioned concept of domaine réservé must be reconceptualised into what I call the ‘domaine privilégié’\nResponse to Russian Malicious Cyber Activity and Harassment’ (29 December 2016) <https: 12=\"\" 2016=\"\" 29=\"\" document-president-actions-response-russian-malicious-cyber-activity=\"\" the-press-office=\"\" obamawhitehouse.archives.gov=\"\"> accessed 3 October 2019.

France was perhaps the sole exception, as French Minister of Foreign Affairs Ayrault declared at the Parliament that any foreign interference in the presidential campaign of 2017 would constitute ‘a breach of the principle of non-intervention’ that could justify ‘retaliatory measures’. He added: ‘no foreign power is allowed to influence Frenchmen’s choice; no foreign power is allowed to choose the next President of the Republic’.

I also argue in favour of a balanced reinterpretation of the concept of coercion, in order to encompass serious forms of foreign meddling, which deprive actors of control and render them powerless. In the end, the proposed definition is that a prohibited intervention occurs whenever a state (or a non-state actor located in that state) is deprived of control over matters within the domaine privilégié, due to the deliberate action of another state (as evidenced prima facie by the characteristics of the malware used).\nAgainst this background, this article is structured as follows. In the next section, I explain that the principle of non-intervention is clearly applicable in cyberspace. I underline, in particular, that its application to cyberthreats is less controversial than other rules, namely sovereignty or the prohibition to use force—whose implementation in a 'digital' space instead of a 'physical' space remains disputed (Section 2). In the third section, I analyse what is domaine réservé and the reason why this concept is no longer adequate to address cyber activities. In particular, I raise doubts about the current integration of political processes and economic orientations within the domaine réservé, and I contend that it fails to protect those private actors that are vital to the social and cultural system of a state (such as press bodies). I then explain why the notion of domaine réservé should be replaced by the notion of domaine privilégié, what it means and how it would apply to cyberspace (Section 3). In the fourth section, I dwell on the concept of coercion and explain what it means. I underline that the traditional understanding of coercion fails to grasp situations where the state is deprived of its control, and I support a balanced reinterpretation of this concept (Section 4). Some conclusions are offered in the last section (Section 5).\n## 2.

It thus offers a well-established and valuable source of regulation in the digital sphere. Then, and contrary to sovereignty and the use of force, the application of non-intervention does not raise the thorny issue of the 'territoriality' of cyberspace. The difficulties in applying these concepts partly reside in the fact that they were conceived to apply in a physical space,¹³ in order to prevent trespass onto one's territory or the use of weapons by a state against the territory or the troops of another state. Yet, there is 'deep uncertainty about the treatment of cyberspace as just another physical space, like land, air, or sea - over which States may exercise sovereignty or control'.¹⁴ In contrast, with non-\nInformation Space Activities Concept' (2000) <http: en=\"\" equity=\"\" publications=\"\" eng.mil.ru=\"\" more.htm?id=\"10845074@cmsArticle\"> accessed 24 February 2020.

Therefore, a state-sponsored activity can breach the principle of non-intervention, even in the absence of ground, air or naval operations on foreign territory.¹⁶ It is significant, in that sense, that the ICJ underlined that ‘[b]etween independent States, respect for territorial sovereignty is an essential foundation of international relations … and international law requires political integrity\n¹⁵ Nicaragua (n 1) para 205.\n¹⁶ It may be noted that some authors resort to a subtle distinction between ‘non-interference’ and ‘non-intervention’. For instance, Niki Aloupi supports a ‘distinction between non-intervention (territorial integrity) and non-interference (independence and autonomy)’, which is ‘theoretically clear’. See: N Aloupi, ‘The Right to Non-intervention and Non-interference’ (2015) 4(3) Cambridge Journal of International and Comparative Law 566, 572. According to Karine Bannelier and Théodore Christakis, non-intervention ‘refers to the protection of the territory of the State, of its dominium, and that its violation would therefore involve the carrying out of material operations in foreign territory’. In contrast, non-interference ‘would refer to interference, without the authorization of the State, in the sphere of the exercise of its national sovereign powers and would, therefore, affect the imperium of the State’. See: K Bannelier and T Christakis, Cyber-Attacks, Prevention-Reactions: The Role of States and Private Actors (Les Cahiers de la Revue Défense Nationale 2017) 43. See also: P-M Dupuy and Y Kerbrat, Droit International Public (Dalloz 2014), paras 117–19. Yet, and as noted by Michael Wood, ‘in most contexts, the two terms seem to be used interchangeably’. See: M Wood, ‘Non-intervention (Non-interference in Domestic Affairs)’ (Encyclopedia Princetoniensis) <https: 551=\"\" pesd.princeton.edu=\"\" node=\"\"> accessed 15 July 2020. According to some authors, the difference between an interference and an intervention lies elsewhere, in the fact that the sole intervention is coercive and consequently, unlawful. See: R Jennings and A Watts, Oppenheim’s International Law-Vol I: Peace (9th edn, OUP 2008) 432; C Henderson, The Use of Force and International Law (CUP 2018) 51; M Schmitt (ed), Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations (CUP 2017) 313. It may be noted that declarations and case law are of little help to cut a clear distinction between ‘non-intervention’ and ‘non-interference’. The blurring probably culminated in Declaration 2625, which is supposed to contain ‘principles of international law’. It indeed mentioned that ‘[n]o State or group of States has the right to intervene, directly or indirectly, for any reason whatever, in the internal or external affairs of any other State. Consequently, armed intervention and all other forms of interference or attempted threats against the personality of the State or against its political, economic and cultural elements, are in violation of international law.’ See: UNGA Res 2625. In 1986, the ICJ found that ‘[t]he principle of non-intervention involves the right of every sovereign State to conduct its affairs without outside interference’. See: Nicaragua (n 1) para 202. In 2005, the ICJ ruled that ‘Uganda had violated the sovereignty and also the territorial integrity of the DRC. Uganda’s actions equally constituted an interference in the internal affairs of the DRC … The unlawful military intervention by Uganda was of such a magnitude and duration that the Court consider[ed] it to be a grave violation’ of UN Charter’s art 2(4).

For the sake of clarity, I will use the term 'meddling' to describe 'the act of trying to change or have an influence on things that are not your responsibility', without a legal connotation. In contrast, I will use the term 'intervention' to describe those coercive—and unlawful—activities directed against the internal or external affairs of other states.\n# 3. A reconceptualisation of the domaine réservé\nIn this section, I will first explain the concept of domaine réservé, and why this old-fashioned concept is unsatisfactory in the digital era (Subsection 3A). To alleviate this problem, I argue in favour of a reconceptualisation of the concept into a domaine privilégié (Subsection 3B).\n# A. The concept of domaine réservé\nThe exact wording used by the ICJ in the Nicaragua case to address the first component of a prohibited intervention was the following:\n... the principle forbids all States or groups of States to intervene directly or indirectly in internal or external affairs of other States. A prohibited intervention must accordingly be one bearing on matters in which each State is permitted, by the principle of State sovereignty, to decide freely. One of these is the choice of a political, economic, social and cultural system, and the formulation of foreign policy.[19]\nThis condition is often reconciled with the notion of state domaine réservé, which 'describes areas where States are free from international obligations and regulation'.[20]\nThe challenge with the domaine réservé resides in its shifting contours. In fact, the Permanent Court of International Justice (PCIJ) underlined that '[t]he question whether a certain matter is or is not solely within the jurisdiction of a State [ie if it is part of the domaine réservé] is an essentially relative question; it depends on the development of international relations'.[21] However, few domains are now totally\n17 Nicaragua (n 1) para 202.\n18 Definition of 'meddling' (Cambridge Dictionary) <https: anglais=\"\" dictionary.cambridge.org=\"\" media=\"\" fr=\"\" meddling=\"\"> accessed 22 March 2020.\n19 Nicaragua (n 1) para 205.\n20 K Ziegler, 'Domaine Réservé' in Max Planck Encyclopaedia of Public International Law (2013) para 1.\n21 Nationality Decrees Issued in Tunis and Morocco on Nov. 8th, 1921 (Advisory Opinion) [1923] PCIJ Rep Series B No 4, 24.</https:>\nReviving the Principle of Non-Intervention in Cyberspace 431\nisolated from international law.²² For instance, states are increasingly constrained in their ability to make free economic decisions.²³ Free-trade agreements—the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT),²⁴ General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS),²⁵ European Economic Area (EEA),²⁶ North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA),²⁷ ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA)²⁸ and Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA),²⁹ to name just a few—have prospered, and judicial mechanisms have even been created to enforce some of them.³⁰ Thus, in the current state of international law, most economic questions pulled out of the domaine réservé. But that's not all. States entered into international agreements in the area of electoral process too.³¹ From a certain perspective, one might conclude that it is not within the domaine réservé anymore. After all, the ICJ made clear that '[a] State, which is free to decide upon the principle and methods of popular consultation within its domestic order, is sovereign for the purpose of accepting a limitation of its sovereignty in this field'.³²\n²² P Kunig, ‘Intervention, Prohibition of’ in R Wolfrum et al (eds), Max Planck Encyclopaedia of Public International Law (OUP, online edition, 2008) para 3; J Verhoeven, ‘Non-intervention: \"Affaires intérieures\" ou \"Vie privée\"?’ in Le droit international au service de la paix, de la justice et du développement: mélanges Michel Virally (Pedone 1991) 497; Ziegler (n 20) para 3.\n²³ See: D Hollis, ‘The Influence of War; the War for Influence’ (2018) 32 Temple International &amp; Comparative Law Journal 31, 40; I Navarette, ‘L’Espionnage en Temps de Paix en Droit International Public’ (2015) 53 Canadian Yearbook of International Law 1, 30.\n²⁴ General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Adopted on 30 October 1947, entered into force on 1 January 1948) 55 UNTS 194.\n²⁵ General Agreement on Trade in Services (1869 UNTS 183) Annex 1B of the Marrakech Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization (Adopted on 15 April 1994, entered into force on 1 January 1995).\n²⁶ European Economic Area Agreement (Adopted on 2 May 1992, entered into force on 1 January 1994).\n²⁷ North American Free Trade Agreement (Adopted on 17 December 1992, entered into force on 1 January 1994) 32 ILM 289.\n²⁸ ASEAN Free Trade Area Agreement (Adopted on 28 January 1992, entered into force 1 January 2003).\n²⁹ Treaty Establishing the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (Adopted on 5 November 1993, entered into force on 8 December 1994) 33 ILM 1067.\n³⁰ For instance, the European Court of Justice (ECJ), the WTO Appellate Body and the COMESA Court of Justice.\n³¹ For instance, electoral rights of citizens are protected under art 25 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR).

The ICJ previously mentioned: '[h]owever, the assertion of a commitment raises the question of the possibility of a State binding itself by agreement in relation to a question of domestic policy, such as that relating to the holding of free elections on its territory. The Court cannot discover, within the range of subjects open to international agreement, any obstacle or provision to hinder a State from making a commitment of this kind.'\nThibault Moulin\nObviously, this is extremely problematic. Let us imagine, for instance, that the Russians did not carry out a hack-and-leak operation against the DNC, but blackmailed the US President into resigning or directly tampered with the election results. Alternatively, let us imagine that ‘State A’ and ‘State B’ are both competing to sell jet-fighters to ‘State C’. State A decides to infect the electronic systems of the jet-fighters manufactured by State B, in order to cause failures, damage their reputation, end their production and —at the end of the day—win the bid and eliminate a competitor. If these areas are not within the domaine réservé anymore, then even those extreme forms of meddling in the political or economic affairs of another state would not qualify as prohibited interventions.\nAnother problem with the concept of domaine réservé is that it fails to regulate those cyber operations exclusively directed against private actors, even if they are vital to the social[33] and cultural system of a state.[34] For instance, the cyberattacks against Sony Pictures Entertainment (SPE) in 2014 revealed the attempts of foreign governments to meddle with values that are essential to liberal democracies, such as freedom of expression. As a matter of fact, 'the real motive of the operation appears to have been an attempt to prevent the film's global distribution as well as an attempt to deter SPE and other studios from insulting the North Korean regime'.[35] It must be said that this attempt was partially successful, as SPE had to cancel the film's release.[36] This decision was criticised by President Obama himself, who declared:\n[w]e cannot have a society where some dictator someplace can start imposing censorship here in the United States ... Imagine if producers and distributors and others start engaging in self-censorship because they don't want to offend the sensibilities of someone who's sensibilities probably need to be offended.[37]\nYet, and by virtue of the lex lata, the fact that such attacks were exclusively targeting a private company excludes the possibility to describe them in terms of prohibited interventions.[38] And indeed, the US government opted for an\n33 A 'social system' may be defined as 'the patterned series of interrelationships existing between individuals, groups, and institutions and forming a coherent whole'.

Alternatively, let us imagine that the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) launches a series of attacks against the movie industry in France, to protest the upcoming release of a similar comedy depicting the North Korean regime. They paralyse the movie industry, and studios experience significant economic losses. The goal is to put such pressure on the Minister of Culture that he is forced to refuse to grant the movie a ‘visa d’exploitation’ (ie the authorisation to broadcast a film).⁴⁰ If one admits that restrictions to the freedom of expression are still part of the domaine réservé—which is arguably not the case, as human rights conventions usually regulate this area⁴¹—these attacks are more likely to qualify as interventions because the private actor was only targeted to obtain something from the state. In fact, attacks against the movie industry or newspapers are on the rise, and the resort to ‘criminal hackers’ might just ‘provide a cheap and easy way of censoring the press’.⁴² To alleviate this risk, I suggest replacement of the old-fashioned concept of domaine réservé with the newer domaine privilégié.\n## B. The concept of domaine privilégié\nThe objections raised against the concept of domaine réservé are the following: it has been stripped of most of its content and it is maladjusted to the new contribution of non-state actors to the exercise of fundamental freedoms. Consequently, a domaine réservé—based principle of non-interventions fails to protect the free choice and the stability of a political, economic, social or cultural system from foreign attacks. This is where the domaine privilégié comes in, as it appears necessary to opt for a concept with clear-cut contours, which remains unaffected by the development of international law, and protects the fundamental interests of a state and its population.⁴³ In fact, this concept of\nany attempt to coerce the US government to take a particular course of action’: N Tsagourias, ‘Electoral Cyber Interference, Self-determination and the Principle of Non-intervention in Cyberspace’ (2019) 8 <www.ssrn.com 2020=\"\" abstract=\"3438567\"> accessed 6 February 2020.\n³⁹ D Chiacu and S Holland, ‘Obama Says Sony Hack Not an Act of War’ Reuters (22 December 2014) <www.reuters.com 2020=\"\" article=\"\" obama-says-sony-hack-not-an-act-of-war-iduskbn0jx1mh20141222=\"\" us-sony-cybersecurity-usa=\"\"> accessed 1 May 2020.\n⁴⁰ Code du cinéma et de l’image animée, art L 211-1.\n⁴¹ Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (ECHR) (adopted 4 November 1950, entered into force 3 September 1953) 213 UNTS 22, art 10§2; ICCPR, art 19.\n⁴² M Nichols and L Charbonneau, ‘Cyber Attacks Against Media on the Rise, Rights Group Says’ Reuters (15 February 2013) <www.reuters.com 2020=\"\" article=\"\" net-us-media-cyberattacks=\"\" cyber-attacks-against-media-on-the-rise-rights-group-says-idusbre91d1ln20130214=\"\"> accessed 25 February 2020.\n⁴³ As once underlined by Antonios Tzanakopoulos: ‘[t]hings would be different if it could be shown that states possess a certain bundle of inherent rights which they</www.reuters.com></www.reuters.com></www.ssrn.com>\nThibault Moulin\n'fundamental', 'vital' or 'essential' interests materialises in certain areas of international law and may help theorising the domaine privilégié.⁴⁴\nBy virtue of the protective principle, states may establish jurisdiction over certain crimes that affect their vital interests,⁴⁵ irrespective of the place where they occurred, the citizenship of the author or where he/she lives.⁴⁶ The protected interests typically include state security and public safety—ie against terrorism, espionage, murder of government officials, hostage-taking—as well as economic and social stability—ie against counterfeiting of currency and various offences, such as 'falsification of official documents, perjury before consular officials, and conspiracy to violate immigration or customs laws'.⁴⁷ It is worth noting, thus, that 'the protective principle can be invoked with respect to a far broader range of acts than the rights to self-defence'.⁴⁸\nIn addition, Article 25 of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (DARS) acknowledges the existence of a ground for precluding wrongfulness called 'necessity'. Necessity may be invoked when an otherwise illegal measure 'is the only way for the State to safeguard an essential interest against a grave and imminent peril'.⁴⁹ Yet, the International Law Commission (ILC) made clear that 'essential interests' were not restricted to cases where the 'existence' of the state was in danger,⁵⁰ highlighting that necessity had also been invoked to prevent 'the extermination of a fur seal\nare not entitled to dispose of freely in the exercise of their sovereignty.'

An interruption of</www.echr.coe.int>\nThibault Moulin\nAgo took pains, though, to distinguish necessity from the naturalist doctrine of the ‘Fundamental Rights of States’. The early roots of this doctrine can be found in Hobbes’s writings,⁶¹ and it was theorised by authors such as Wolff and Vattel. Wolff considered that nations had a ‘duty of self-preservation’.⁶² Hence, ‘every nation ha[d] the right to those means by which it can, as far as possible, avert the peril of destruction and avoid those things which can bring destruction upon it’.⁶³ Vattel defined certain ‘inalienable rights’ of nations, those required by ‘necessity’ or for its ‘preservation’—and their satisfaction usually justified the use of force.⁶⁴ Years later, Gidel thought that states had ‘fundamental’ or ‘inherent’ rights, which were ‘absolute, inviolable and unalienable’, and included ‘preservation, independence, equality, respect, international trade’.⁶⁵ Self-preservation actually gained a negative reputation,⁶⁶ as it was often ‘the criterion used to justify the rights of states to have recourse to arms’ and ‘for the violation of the rights of other subjects’.⁶⁷ Yet, literature of the post-war era reveals an alternative reading of self-preservation, which is more respectful of the rights of other states. For instance, Alfaro highlighted that ‘[s]elf-preservation rests upon the reciprocal\nsupplies of petroleum products, with the resultant dangers for the country’s existence, could therefore seriously affect the public security …’: Campus Oil Limited and others v Minister for Industry and Energy and others (Judgment) [1984] ECR 1984-02727, para 34; E Brosset, ‘Le protectionnisme et le motif de protection de la santé en droit de l’Union européenne’ (Hal, 2014) <https: 942752=\"\" docid=\"\" file=\"\" file/index=\"\" file@unione.europei_enne2.pdf=\"\" docid/942752=\"\" filename=\"\" hal.archives-ouvertes.fr=\"\"> accessed 5 May 2020.\n⁶¹ T Hobbes, Leviathan (1651), pt II, ch XVIII, para 6.

Hence, a nation had allegedly ‘the right of procuring provisions by force’, when a neighbour refused to sell its oversupply, ‘the right of innocent use’ of ‘inexhaustible’ resources, such as water and the sea, as well as the right to ‘force a passage when it [was] unjustly refused’, provided that there was ‘a real necessity [that] oblige[d] you to enter into the territory of others’. It then had the right to make use, ‘either by free consent or by force’, of ‘the ships, waggons, horses, or even the personal labour of foreigners’, and provided that it a ‘pressing want’ and pay ‘a compensation’ for them. Vattel also underlined this ‘right’ for ‘a nation of men’, to ‘procure women, who are absolutely necessary to its preservation’, and to use force if needed, and the right of foreigners to ‘mak[e] a settlement in the first country where they find land enough for themselves, without depriving the inhabitants of what is sufficient for them’.

Yet, in contrast with necessity or the early doctrine of self-preservation, it does not provide justification for breaching the rights of other states, but results in a duty of abstention: states must refrain from meddling with the domaine privilégié of other states. This domaine privilégié includes not only the elements necessary for the very survival of a state but also those that are essential for its independence, autonomy and stability.\nFirst, it protects the political organisation of the state, including the forms of government, the rule of law, personal, collective and political freedoms, as well as the electoral process in full (primary, local and general elections, referenda, etc). Under this new framework, the hack-and-leak operation that targeted the DNC would meddle with the American electoral process and, therefore, with the US domaine privilégié. It would also be affected in the event of cyber operations directed at the movie industry or press organs—like the SPE scenarios—as they seek to restrict the exercise of fundamental freedoms.\nSecondly, it encompasses internal and external security. For instance, the 2015 data breach at the US Office of Personnel Management (OPM) compromised the security of the USA, as it could 'reveal the identities of CIA [Central Intelligence Agency] operatives serving under diplomatic cover'.69 In this case, the domaine privilégié of the USA was obviously affected.\nThirdly, it incorporates major economic interests, ie 'interests so essential that a breach of them threatens the economic ... stability' of the state.70 Key and energy industries, major employers, transports, banking transactions and telecommunications may qualify as such. For instance, and considering that the petrochemical sector 'is a core part of the Saudi economy',71 the cyberattacks against oil companies in Saudi Arabia may affect its domaine privilégié. The same would be true for the 2017 NotPetya attacks, which were aimed at disrupting Ukraine's financial system.72 Insofar as they may provoke the downfall\n68 R Alfaro, 'The Rights and Duties of States' (1959) 97 Recueil des Cours 91, 112.\n69 E Nakashima, 'Hacks of OPM Databases Compromised 22.1 Million People, Federal Authorities Say' The Washington Post (9 July 2015) <www.washingtonpost.com 4=\"\" 4=\"\" 56.=\"\" [?utm_term=.b890029da58b=\"\" [?num_term=.b890029da58b=\"\" [?www.bis.cz=\"\" ]=\"\" accessed=\"\" and=\"\" are=\"\" as=\"\" atacks=\"\" be=\"\" been=\"\" by=\"\" c=\"\" c.=\"\" c.4=\"\" c.5=\"\" c.6=\"\" c.7=\"\" c.8=\"\" c.9=\"\" c.10=\"\" c.11=\"\" c.12=\"\" c.15=\"\" c.16.4=\"\" c.17=\"\" c.18.=\"\" c.2=\"\" c.3=\"\" c.4=\"\" c.5=\"\" c.6.=\"\" c.7=\"\" c.8.=\"\" c.9=\"\" c.100.=\"\" c.11=\"\" c.120.=\"\" c.13=\"\" c.14=\"\" c.15=\"\" c.16=\"\" c.17=\"\" c.18.=\"\" a=\"\" a.=\"\" a/cn.4=\"\" a/cp.10=\"\" a/p.10=\"\" a/=\"\" a/15=\"\" a/17=\"\" a/18=\"\" a/2015=\"\" a/2018=\"\" a/2018.=\"\" a/2020.=\"\" a/2020.=\"\" a/2020.=\"\" a/2020.=\"\" a/2020.=\"\" a/2020.=\"\" a/2020.=\"\" a/2020.=\"\" according=\"\" ac=\"\" acc.=\"\" against=\"\" a}=\"\" a}}=\"\" b=\"\" b.=\"\" b.10=\"\" b.11=\"\" b.12=\"\" b.15=\"\" b.17=\"\" b.18=\"\" b.2=\"\" b.3=\"\" b.4=\"\" b.5=\"\" b.6.=\"\" b.7=\"\" b.8=\"\" b.9=\"\" b.100=\"\" b.11=\"\" b.1200.=\"\" b.1200.=\"\" b.1200.=\"\" b.1200.=\"\" b.1200.=\"\" b.1200.\nThibault Moulin\nof the aviation industry in 'State B', the cyberattacks induced by 'State A' in the fictitious example above would also impair the former's domaine privilégié.\nFourthly, it embraces public services, including health and social systems. Hence, state-sponsored attacks against hospitals would obviously affect the domaine privilégié. For instance, in March 2020, the Brno University Hospital had to turn away patients 'suffering serious conditions', and 'urgent surgeries' were postponed following a cyberattack, which shutdown all computers.73 In such situations, the impact on the domaine privilégié is obvious.\nFifthly, the domaine privilégié may extend to the preservation of a state's environment. For example, the 2017 NotPetya attacks also broke the monitoring systems of the nuclear power plant in Chernobyl, and they could have led to long-lasting damage to Ukraine's environment.74\nForeign meddling with this domaine privilégié would be prohibited, unless adopted within the legal framework of countermeasures.75 If the proposed concept of domaine privilégié is clearly de lege ferenda,76 it results from state practice that some governments might actually be sympathetic, for example, to the protection of main economic interests through the principle of non-intervention.77\nworld/national-security/russian-military-was-behind-notpetya-cyberattack-in-ukraine-cia-concludes/2018/01/12/048d8506-f7ca-11e7-b34a-b85626af34ef_story.html&gt; accessed 9 May 2020.\n73 M Burgess, 'Hackers Are Targeting Hospitals Crippled by Coronavirus' WIRED (22 March 2020) <www.wired.co.uk article=\"\" coronavirus-hackers-cybercrime-phishing=\"\"> accessed 11 May 2020.\n74 A Griffin, \"Petya\" Cyber-attack: Chernobyl's Radiation Monitoring System Hit by Worldwide Hack' The Independent (27 June 2017) <www.independent.co.uk ber-latest-a7810941.html=\"\" europe=\"\" gerr=\"\" news=\"\" world=\"\" world'europe=\"\" www.independent.co.uk=\"\"> accessed 6 May 2020.\n75 'Countermeasures are unilateral measures adopted by a State (the \"injured State\") in response to the breach of its rights by the wrongful act of another State (the \"wrongdoing\" or \"target\" State) that affect the rights of the target State and are aimed at inducing it to provide cessation or reparations to the injured State.'

See, for respectively Australia, the Netherlands and the USA: Government (Australia) (n 11); Government (the Netherlands) (n 11); Egan (n 11).\n77 The director of the French National Cybersecurity Agency (ANSSI) once denounced 'attempts of intervention and influence', and those who were 'eager to prevent' France 'from protecting its main economic and scientific interests'.

A reconceptualisation of coercion\nIn this section, I will first explain the traditional definition of the concept of coercion, and why it is unsatisfactory in the digital era (Subsection 4A). I then put forward my own reappraisal of the concept of coercion (Subsection 4B).\n## A. The traditional definition of coercion\nCoercion must be equated with the implementation of ‘coercive measures’ or ‘coercive methods’ and must be distinguished from the mere influence or persuasion.⁷⁸ In fact, Vattel described interference as an ‘attempt to put a constraint on [the] deliberations’ of another state,⁷⁹ whereas Kant put down that ‘[n]o State shall by force interfere with the constitution or government of another State’.⁸⁰ The Montevideo Convention on the Rights and Duties of States of 1933 established a duty of non-recognition of situations ‘obtained by force whether this consist[ed] in the employment of arms, in threatening diplomatic representations, or in any other effective coercive measures’.⁸¹ The Charter of the Organization of American States (OAS) prevented states from ‘us[ing] or encouraging[ing] the use of coercive measures of an economic or political character in order to force the sovereign will of another state and obtain from it advantages of any kind’.⁸² It also underlined that ‘[n]o territorial acquisitions or special advantages obtained either by force or by other means of coercion shall be recognized’.⁸³ In the Nicaragua case, the ICJ used the term ‘methods of coercion’.⁸⁴ Another question that arises is whether intention is necessary. An analysis of the ICJ case law confirms that intention must be taken into account.⁸⁵\nAssemblée Nationale (France), ‘Première Séance Du Lundi 13 Avril 2015’ (13 April 2015) <www.assemblee-nationale.fr 14=\"\" 14-cri=\"\" 2014-2015=\"\" 20150212.asp#p511027=\"\"> accessed 13 February 2020.

For a contrary view, see:</http:></www.assemblee-nationale.fr></www.assemblee-nationale.fr>\nThibault Moulin\nHowever, the sole intention to secure change or to put pressure—in contrast with, for instance, the intention to overthrow a government—is sufficient. As the Court noted in the Nicaragua case:\n... in international law, if one State, with a view to the coercion of another State, supports and assists armed bands in that State whose purpose is to overthrow the government of that State, that amounts to an intervention by the one State in the internal affairs of the other, whether or not the political objective of the State giving such support and assistance is equally far-reaching.⁸⁶\nIn fact, the Court did not find it necessary ‘to seek to establish whether the intention of the United States to secure a change of governmental policies in Nicaragua went so far as to be equated with an endeavour to overthrow the Nicaraguan Government’.⁸⁷ This criterion was not challenged by the judgment pertaining to the Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo.⁸⁸ It is true that the Court found that non-intervention was violated ‘even if the objectives of Uganda were not to overthrow President Kabila’, and were intended ‘to securing towns and airports for reason of its perceived security needs, and in support of the parallel activity of those engaged in civil war’.⁸⁹ Yet, this position may be explained by the fact that a prohibited use of force was also found.⁹⁰ In its traditional sense, coercion thus occurs when a state deploys those means of pressure against another state, which are of a sufficiently serious nature to, and with the intention to, compel the latter to act in a certain way—or to refrain from acting in a certain way—and against its own will.⁹¹ Coercion is not a result-\nS Watts, ‘Low-intensity Cyber Operations and the Principle of Non-intervention’ in JD Ohlin, K Govern and C Finkelstein (eds), *Cyber War: Law and Ethics for Virtual Conflicts* (OUP 2015) 268.\n⁸⁶ Nicaragua (n 1) para 241. ‘With a view to the coercion’ was translated in the French version into ‘exercer une pression’ (ie ‘put pressure’).\n⁸⁷ ibid. Yet, it was ‘clearly established’ that ‘the United States intended, by its support of the contras, to coerce the Government of Nicaragua’, and ‘that the intention of the contras themselves was to overthrow the present Government of Nicaragua’.\n⁸⁸ Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo (n 16).\n⁸⁹ ibid, para 163.\n⁹⁰ ibid, paras 164 and 165.\n⁹¹ ‘Coercion in inter-State relations involves the government of one State compelling the government of another State to think or act in a certain way by applying various kinds of pressure, threats, intimidation or the use of force’: C Joyner, ‘Coercion’ in R Wolfrum et al (eds), *Max Planck Encyclopaedia of Public International Law* (OUP, online edition, 2006) para 1. ‘Coercion’ is defined by the Black’s Law Dictionary as the ‘compulsion of a free agent by physical, moral, or economic force or threat of physical force’: definition of ‘coercion’, *Black’s Law Dictionary* (10th edn, 2014). The French translation—‘contrainte’—confirms this meaning and may be defined as follows: ‘[a]ction de contraindre, de forcer quelqu’un à agir contre sa volonté; pression morale ou physique, violence exercée sur lui.’ See: Definition of ‘contrainte’ (*Larousse*) &lt;www.larousse.fr/dictionnaires/francais/contrainte/18670#pWqM8QLtC0uMc51R.99&gt; accessed 26 March 2020. See also: P Daillier, M Forteau and A\nReviving the Principle of Non-Intervention in Cyberspace 441\nbased approach, and whether the use of coercive measures was successful or not is of no significance. For instance, the ICJ concluded in the Nicaragua case that the principle of non-intervention was breached by the USA even if the attempt at securing political change failed.⁹²\nThis understanding of coercion sets a high threshold and most cyber operations do not pass this test.⁹³ If a state was demanding another one to declare the wrong candidate a winner of the elections, or to declare the favourite candidate ineligible on false grounds, under the threat of launching a debilitating wave of cyberattacks, then the criterion of coercion would be met. Yet, it constitutes a textbook case which will rarely (if ever) happen in practice. In practice, democracy, freedom of expression or the proper functioning of infrastructures (among others) are hindered without a need for ‘compelling’ a state through the deployment of ‘coercive methods’. If Russia’s objective was to help Trump in the case of the DNC,⁹⁴ voters or the government were not ‘coerced’ stricto sensu. The former were given stolen information and fake news to persuade them to vote for Donald Trump—or ‘not vote at all’.⁹⁵ Then, state-sponsored attacks often take the form of ‘cyber-vandalism’ and would not pass the coercion test either. Let us take two actual examples of attacks against press organs. In April 2015, the French television network TV5Monde was the victim of a cyberattack directed by the so-called ‘CyberCaliphate’, who claimed to belong to the Islamic State.⁹⁶ The distribution of programmes was interrupted for hours.⁹⁷ Two months later, investigations revealed that the attack was more likely sponsored by Moscow and may constitute nothing more than an act of retaliation in reaction to the French and European measures adopted against\nPellet, Droit International Public (LGDJ 2009) 1025–26; Government (the Netherlands) (n 11).\n⁹² Nicaragua (n 1) para 292(3).\n⁹³ The USA, through the voice of Brian Egan, acknowledged that non-intervention was ‘generally viewed as a relatively narrow rule of customary international law …’.

This may appear, from a certain perspective, as highly unsatisfactory, and it reveals that the concept of ‘coercion’ is in need of a reappraisal, to fit the new peculiarities of cyberattacks.¹⁰⁵\n## B. The reappraisal of coercion\nAs mentioned above, ‘coercion’ historically occurs ‘when a State deploys those means of pressure against another State, that are of a sufficiently serious nature to, and with the intention to, compel the latter to act in a certain way – or to refrain from acting in a certain way – and against its own will’. Yet, this definition is unsatisfactory in the cyber realm and fails to grasp new types of highly disruptive cyberattacks.¹⁰⁶ Any reappraisal of the coercion is a risky exercise, though, and we must beware of excessively watering down this concept, at the risk of hindering basic interstate relations.\nIn particular, the distinction between plain ‘influence’ and constraint must be maintained.¹⁰⁷ It is likely that states will use the information they obtained through cyberespionage operations to influence the negotiation strategies and decision-making of other states, in line with their own interests.¹⁰⁸ It is also likely that states that suffered cyberattacks or acts of cyberespionage will adapt their internal and external policies, either for the purpose of repairing the damage or for preventing further strikes. For instance, after the revelations on mass surveillance of the National Security Agency (NSA), Germany did not want to depend on US technologies anymore and decided to create a new agency to\n¹⁰⁵ The principle of due diligence might however be relevant to address those situations.

This is true both of the digital and physical domains.¹¹¹ As once underlined by Switzerland, there is—and I think there must be—a ‘limit between the lawful influence and the unlawful constraint’.¹¹²\nIt was previously argued that two elements must usually be taken into consideration to make sure that coercion occurred: (i) the resort to means of a sufficiently serious nature; and (ii) the intention of the author.

State A makes a $85 million offer, whereas State B makes a $83 million offer. State A finally wins the contract, after making another offer: $82 million. State A was indeed obliged—due to the lower price proposed by State B—to change its position. Then, let us imagine that the companies based in ‘State D’ manufacture cars and sell them in large quantities abroad. A few years later, companies in ‘State E’ start manufacturing cars to a lower price, and the car industry collapses in State D, prompting the latter in renewing its economic or tax policies. State D indeed had—due to the economic emergence of State E—to review its policies. Let us take a third and last example. State F is a developing country that depends on foreign aid to fund the police. Following a wave of protest, the police in State F fires teargas and rubber bullets on demonstrators. State G—which is a donor—is shocked and decides to halt some aid. To remedy this situation, State F decides to cut education funding. In fact, State G prompted State F into changing its policies. If we equate ‘coercion’ with ‘influence’, these classical situations might result in prohibited interventions—and generate countermeasures in return.

They deprive actors of control and render them powerless instead.¹¹³ With election meddling, citizens are deprived of the possibility of expressing themselves democratically.¹¹⁴ For instance, the goal of the hack-and-leak operation that targeted the DNC was to reshape the public opinion and ‘represent[ed] the most recent expression of Moscow’s longstanding desire to undermine the US-led liberal democratic order’.¹¹⁵ Attacks directed at the media industry deprive organs of the possibility to express themselves and deprive citizens of the right to information. NotPetya attacks deprived Ukraine of the possibility to control financial transactions and the radioactivity level at the Chernobyl plant. It is thus necessary, for a reappraisal of coercion, to take those particularities into account. In a digital context, coercion may then be conceptualised as ‘a deprivation of control (1), resulting from the deliberate action of another State, as evidenced prima facie by the characteristics of the malware used (2)’.

For instance, the Australian government suggests: ‘[a] prohibited intervention is one that interferes by coercive means (in the sense that they effectively deprive another state of the ability to control, decide upon or govern matters of an inherently sovereign nature) …’. See: Government (Australia) (n 11). I first read it in Harriet Moynihan’s paper, where this definition is discussed: H Moynihan, ‘The Application of International Law to State Cyberattacks’ (Chatham House, 2019) 40–43 <www.chathamhouse.org default=\"\" files=\"\" files/publications=\"\" research=\"\" sites=\"\" research/2019-11-29-intl-law-cyberattacks.pdf=\"\"> accessed 6 February 2020. Robert Jennings and Arthur Watts also suggested: ‘to constitute intervention, the interference must be forcible or dictatorial, or otherwise coercive, in effect depriving the state intervened against of control over the matter in question’. See: Jennings and Watts (n 16) 432.\n¹¹⁴ Tampering with the electoral results has been described as prohibited interventions by some states, including Australia, Switzerland, the UK and the USA. See: Caflisch (n 11) 105; Attorney General’s Office and Jeremy Wright (UK) (n 8); Egan, ‘Remarks on International Law and Stability in Cyberspace’ (n 11); Government (Australia) (n 11). Describing ballot stuffing in terms of prohibited intervention is however not a new idea. In the 1980s, the US Congress highlighted that ‘[u]nilateral intervention in the internal affairs of other nations is antithetical to democracy. It contravenes international treaties and norms that are vital to the long-term peace and security of all nations in the Hemisphere. Intervention violates the right of self-determination which is the underpinning of every democracy.’ See: United States Congress House Committee on Appropriations Subcommittee on Foreign Operations and Related Agencies Appropriations, Foreign Assistance and Related Programs Appropriations for 1985: Hearings Before a Subcommittee of the Committee on Appropriations, House of Representatives, Ninety-Eighth Congress, Second Session (US Government Printing Office 1984) 662. Experts now suggest that doxfare might be at odd with self-determination, but clearly disagree as to whether it also constitutes a prohibited intervention.

It means that a prohibited intervention occurs as soon as these two conditions are met, even if the victim failed to equip itself with state-of-the-art protections, or reacted too late—for instance, due to technical or bureaucratic reasons. In the case of NotPetya, hackers exploited the vulnerabilities of older versions of Windows, for which corrective patches were nonetheless available.¹¹⁶ In the case of the OPM, 'persistent deficiencies' in the IT security programme had been reported before the data breach and were probably not fixed when it happened.¹¹⁷ Yet, these deficiencies do not alter the seriousness of the attacks: a deliberate deprivation of control still occurs.\nIt is finally appropriate to touch on the issue of economic cyberespionage. Under the framework put forward in this article, it is clear that only the most severe forms of intellectual property theft (if there are any) would qualify as prohibited interventions—those prone to threatening the economic stability of a state. If this phenomenon is indeed problematic and calls—in my opinion—for legal answers, tailor-made rules are required. In that sense, the Paris Call is interesting, as signatories pledged to '[p]revent ICT-enabled theft of intellectual property, including trade secrets or other confidential business information, with the intent of providing competitive advantages to companies or commercial sector'.¹¹⁸\n# 5. Conclusion\nIn this article, I championed the applicability of non-intervention in cyberspace. In my view, such applicability is welcomed by the international community and does not raise theoretical questions about the nature of sovereignty or the militarisation of cyberspace. However, I expressed fears that this principle becomes obsolete if we keep equating 'matters in which each State is permitted, by the principle of State sovereignty, to decide freely'¹¹⁹ with the notion of domaine réservé. I thus recommended that, for the purpose of non-intervention, we ought to adopt the notion of state domaine privilégié. The latter encompasses the political organisation of a state, its internal and external security, major economic interests and public services (including the health and social systems), as well as the preservation of a state's environment. Then, I turned to the concept of coercion, arguing in favour of a 'balanced' reinterpretation of coercion—ie a\n¹¹⁶ 'What Is Petya and NotPetya Ransomware' (McAfee) <www.mcafee.com enterprise=\"\" fr-fr=\"\" security-awareness=\"\" ransomware=\"\" petya.html=\"\"> accessed 12 May 2020.\n¹¹⁷ OPM (the USA), 'Semi-Annual Report to Congress' (2015) <www.opm.gov for=\"\" reports-publications=\"\" semi-annual-reports=\"\" sar52.pdf=\"\" www.opm.gov=\"\"> accessed 12 May 2020; D Auerbach, 'The OPM Breach Is a Catastrophe' Slate (16 June 2015) <https: 06=\"\" 2015=\"\" slate.com=\"\" opm-hack-its-a-catastrophe-heres-how-the-government-can-stop-the-next-one.html=\"\" technology=\"\"> accessed 12 May 2020.\n¹¹⁸ 'Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace' (n 8).\n¹¹⁹ Nicaragua (n 1) para 205.</https:></www.opm.gov></www.opm.gov>\nReviving the Principle of Non-Intervention in Cyberspace 447\nreconceptualisation that takes into account situations where states or non-state actors are deprived of control, but does not go as far as equating coercion with influence. This would indeed totally hinder international relations. In the end, it may be argued that a prohibited intervention occurs whenever a state (or a non-state actor located in that state) is deprived of control over matters within the domaine privilégié, due to the deliberate action of another state (as evidenced prima facie by the characteristics of the malware used). Yet, any cyber activity emanating from a state that prompts a given reaction in another state should not automatically be viewed as a prohibited intervention.

In contrast, the relevance of the non-intervention principle is accepted by states and raises less questions about the ‘territoriality’ or the ‘militarization’ of cyberspace. At first sight, it thus appears as a convenient source for the regulation of cyberthreats. However, the *Nicaragua* case also established a stringent test for a foreign interference to qualify as an unlawful intervention. First, it must bear ‘on matters in which each State is permitted, by the principle of State sovereignty to decide freely’ (ie the ‘domaine réservé’). Then, it must involve ‘methods of coercion in regard to such choices’. I contend that both criteria are maladjusted to address cyberthreats and must be reconceptualised. In fact, the *domaine réservé* describes domains where states are free from international rules. However, few domains, including electoral processes or main economic orientations, are totally isolated from international law. I thus argue that it must be reconceptualised into the so-called ‘domaine privilégié’. It consists of a domain with clear-cut contours, unaffected by the developments of international law, which encompasses the fundamental interests of a state and its population. Then, coercion describes situations where a state is compelled to act, or to refrain from acting, in a certain fashion. This traditional approach is also problematic, and I argue that coercion must be understood in terms of deprivation of control.\n## 1. Introduction\nIn his separate opinion attached to the *Nicaragua* case, ICJ President Nagendra Singh felt that he could not ‘conclude this opinion without emphasizing the key\n* Dr Thibault Moulin is a Teaching and Research Assistant at the Université Grenoble-Alpes, France.

In fact, he considered that '[t]o ignore this doctrine is to undermine international order and to promote violence and bloodshed which may prove catastrophic in the end'. More than three decades later, international lawyers' attempts at regulating emerging technologies reveal that the 'principle' of non-intervention might be relevant in situations where there is no risk of 'bloodshed', in a world that lacks flesh and bones: cyberspace. In particular, there has been a renewed interest in this principle since the hack-and-leak operation that targeted the Democratic National Committee (DNC) in 2016 and the alleged interference of Russia in the US elections. If some commentators suggested that Moscow had 'cross[ed] a line', most experts nevertheless came to the conclusion that the so-called 'hack-and-leak' operations were not coercive, and did not constitute a prohibited intervention. The discomfort of the US government with describing this operation as a prohibited intervention was also clear.\nAs a matter of fact,\n\nReviving the Principle of Non-Intervention in Cyberspace 425\nthe ICJ established a 2-fold test to determine the existence (or not) of a prohibited intervention. First, ‘[a] prohibited intervention must … be one bearing on matters in which each State is permitted, by the principle of State sovereignty, to decide freely’. This concept is also known as the ‘domaine réservé’ (reserved domain) of the state. Secondly, a prohibited intervention must use ‘methods of coercion in regard to such choices, which must remain free ones’. It appears that under this stringent test, most cyber operations and attempts at influence will never qualify as prohibited interventions. According to most experts and as suggested above, the main reason is that ‘methods of coercion’ are lacking. I nevertheless argue that this is only part of the problem: in fact, both features are maladjusted to address the characteristics of cyberthreats. My main point, then, is that they must be reconceptualised, and that a new definition of non-intervention in the cyberspace context must be achieved. If we fail to do so, the principle of non-intervention will fall into disuse with regard to cyberthreats. I thus demonstrate that the old-fashioned concept of domaine réservé must be reconceptualised into what I call the ‘domaine privilégié’\nResponse to Russian Malicious Cyber Activity and Harassment’ (29 December 2016) <https: 12=\"\" 2016=\"\" 29=\"\" document-president-actions-response-russian-malicious-cyber-activity=\"\" the-press-office=\"\" obamawhitehouse.archives.gov=\"\"> accessed 3 October 2019.

I also argue in favour of a balanced reinterpretation of the concept of coercion, in order to encompass serious forms of foreign meddling, which deprive actors of control and render them powerless. In the end, the proposed definition is that a prohibited intervention occurs whenever a state (or a non-state actor located in that state) is deprived of control over matters within the domaine privilégié, due to the deliberate action of another state (as evidenced prima facie by the characteristics of the malware used).\nAgainst this background, this article is structured as follows. In the next section, I explain that the principle of non-intervention is clearly applicable in cyberspace. I underline, in particular, that its application to cyberthreats is less controversial than other rules, namely sovereignty or the prohibition to use force—whose implementation in a 'digital' space instead of a 'physical' space remains disputed (Section 2). In the third section, I analyse what is domaine réservé and the reason why this concept is no longer adequate to address cyber activities. In particular, I raise doubts about the current integration of political processes and economic orientations within the domaine réservé, and I contend that it fails to protect those private actors that are vital to the social and cultural system of a state (such as press bodies). I then explain why the notion of domaine réservé should be replaced by the notion of domaine privilégié, what it means and how it would apply to cyberspace (Section 3). In the fourth section, I dwell on the concept of coercion and explain what it means. I underline that the traditional understanding of coercion fails to grasp situations where the state is deprived of its control, and I support a balanced reinterpretation of this concept (Section 4). Some conclusions are offered in the last section (Section 5).\n## 2.

It thus offers a well-established and valuable source of regulation in the digital sphere. Then, and contrary to sovereignty and the use of force, the application of non-intervention does not raise the thorny issue of the 'territoriality' of cyberspace. The difficulties in applying these concepts partly reside in the fact that they were conceived to apply in a physical space, in order to prevent trespass onto one's territory or the use of weapons by a state against the territory or the troops of another state.

It is thus possible to grasp breaches of territorial and political integrity equally. Therefore, a state-sponsored activity can breach the principle of non-intervention, even in the absence of ground, air or naval operations on foreign territory. It is significant, in that sense, that the ICJ underlined that ‘[b]etween independent States, respect for territorial sovereignty is an essential foundation of international relations … and international law requires political integrity\n Nicaragua (n 1) para 205.\n It may be noted that some authors resort to a subtle distinction between ‘non-interference’ and ‘non-intervention’. For instance, Niki Aloupi supports a ‘distinction between non-intervention (territorial integrity) and non-interference (independence and autonomy)’, which is ‘theoretically clear’. See: N Aloupi, ‘The Right to Non-intervention and Non-interference’ (2015) 4(3) Cambridge Journal of International and Comparative Law 566, 572. According to Karine Bannelier and Théodore Christakis, non-intervention ‘refers to the protection of the territory of the State, of its dominium, and that its violation would therefore involve the carrying out of material operations in foreign territory’. In contrast, non-interference ‘would refer to interference, without the authorization of the State, in the sphere of the exercise of its national sovereign powers and would, therefore, affect the imperium of the State’. See: K Bannelier and T Christakis, Cyber-Attacks, Prevention-Reactions: The Role of States and Private Actors (Les Cahiers de la Revue Défense Nationale 2017) 43. See also: P-M Dupuy and Y Kerbrat, Droit International Public (Dalloz 2014), paras 117–19. Yet, and as noted by Michael Wood, ‘in most contexts, the two terms seem to be used interchangeably’. See: M Wood, ‘Non-intervention (Non-interference in Domestic Affairs)’ (Encyclopedia Princetoniensis) <https: 551=\"\" pesd.princeton.edu=\"\" node=\"\"> accessed 15 July 2020. According to some authors, the difference between an interference and an intervention lies elsewhere, in the fact that the sole intervention is coercive and consequently, unlawful. See: R Jennings and A Watts, Oppenheim’s International Law-Vol I: Peace (9th edn, OUP 2008) 432; C Henderson, The Use of Force and International Law (CUP 2018) 51; M Schmitt (ed), Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations (CUP 2017) 313. It may be noted that declarations and case law are of little help to cut a clear distinction between ‘non-intervention’ and ‘non-interference’. The blurring probably culminated in Declaration 2625, which is supposed to contain ‘principles of international law’. It indeed mentioned that ‘[n]o State or group of States has the right to intervene, directly or indirectly, for any reason whatever, in the internal or external affairs of any other State. Consequently, armed intervention and all other forms of interference or attempted threats against the personality of the State or against its political, economic and cultural elements, are in violation of international law.’ See: UNGA Res 2625. In 1986, the ICJ found that ‘[t]he principle of non-intervention involves the right of every sovereign State to conduct its affairs without outside interference’. See: Nicaragua (n 1) para 202. In 2005, the ICJ ruled that ‘Uganda had violated the sovereignty and also the territorial integrity of the DRC. Uganda’s actions equally constituted an interference in the internal affairs of the DRC … The unlawful military intervention by Uganda was of such a magnitude and duration that the Court consider[ed] it to be a grave violation’ of UN Charter’s art 2(4).

For the sake of clarity, I will use the term 'meddling' to describe 'the act of trying to change or have an influence on things that are not your responsibility', without a legal connotation. In contrast, I will use the term 'intervention' to describe those coercive—and unlawful—activities directed against the internal or external affairs of other states.\n# 3. A reconceptualisation of the domaine réservé\nIn this section, I will first explain the concept of domaine réservé, and why this old-fashioned concept is unsatisfactory in the digital era (Subsection 3A). To alleviate this problem, I argue in favour of a reconceptualisation of the concept into a domaine privilégié (Subsection 3B).\n# A. The concept of domaine réservé\nThe exact wording used by the ICJ in the Nicaragua case to address the first component of a prohibited intervention was the following:\n... the principle forbids all States or groups of States to intervene directly or indirectly in internal or external affairs of other States. A prohibited intervention must accordingly be one bearing on matters in which each State is permitted, by the principle of State sovereignty, to decide freely. One of these is the choice of a political, economic, social and cultural system, and the formulation of foreign policy.[19]\nThis condition is often reconciled with the notion of state domaine réservé, which 'describes areas where States are free from international obligations and regulation'.[20]\nThe challenge with the domaine réservé resides in its shifting contours. In fact, the Permanent Court of International Justice (PCIJ) underlined that '[t]he question whether a certain matter is or is not solely within the jurisdiction of a State [ie if it is part of the domaine réservé] is an essentially relative question; it depends on the development of international relations'.[21] However, few domains are now totally\n\nReviving the Principle of Non-Intervention in Cyberspace 431\nisolated from international law. For instance, states are increasingly constrained in their ability to make free economic decisions. Free-trade agreements—the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), European Economic Area (EEA), North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) and Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), to name just a few—have prospered, and judicial mechanisms have even been created to enforce some of them. Thus, in the current state of international law, most economic questions pulled out of the domaine réservé. But that's not all. States entered into international agreements in the area of electoral process too. From a certain perspective, one might conclude that it is not within the domaine réservé anymore. After all, the ICJ made clear that '[a] State, which is free to decide upon the principle and methods of popular consultation within its domestic order, is sovereign for the purpose of accepting a limitation of its sovereignty in this field'.\n P Kunig, ‘Intervention, Prohibition of’ in R Wolfrum et al (eds), Max Planck Encyclopaedia of Public International Law (OUP, online edition, 2008) para 3; J Verhoeven, ‘Non-intervention: \"Affaires intérieures\" ou \"Vie privée\"?’ in Le droit international au service de la paix, de la justice et du développement: mélanges Michel Virally (Pedone 1991) 497; Ziegler (n 20) para 3.\n See: D Hollis, ‘The Influence of War; the War for Influence’ (2018) 32 Temple International &amp; Comparative Law Journal 31, 40; I Navarette, ‘L’Espionnage en Temps de Paix en Droit International Public’ (2015) 53 Canadian Yearbook of International Law 1, 30.\n General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Adopted on 30 October 1947, entered into force on 1 January 1948) 55 UNTS 194.\n General Agreement on Trade in Services (1869 UNTS 183) Annex 1B of the Marrakech Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization (Adopted on 15 April 1994, entered into force on 1 January 1995).\n European Economic Area Agreement (Adopted on 2 May 1992, entered into force on 1 January 1994).\n North American Free Trade Agreement (Adopted on 17 December 1992, entered into force on 1 January 1994) 32 ILM 289.\n ASEAN Free Trade Area Agreement (Adopted on 28 January 1992, entered into force 1 January 2003).\n Treaty Establishing the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (Adopted on 5 November 1993, entered into force on 8 December 1994) 33 ILM 1067.\n For instance, the European Court of Justice (ECJ), the WTO Appellate Body and the COMESA Court of Justice.\n For instance, electoral rights of citizens are protected under art 25 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). See: ICCPR (adopted 16 December 1966, entered into force 23 March 1976) 999 UNTS 171, art 25; ‘General Comment No. 25: The Right to Participate in Public Affairs, Voting Rights and the Right of Equal Access to Public Service’ (art 25) (1996) CCPR/C/21/Rev.1/Add.7.\n Nicaragua (n 1) para 259. The ICJ previously mentioned: '[h]owever, the assertion of a commitment raises the question of the possibility of a State binding itself by agreement in relation to a question of domestic policy, such as that relating to the holding of free elections on its territory. The Court cannot discover, within the range of subjects open to international agreement, any obstacle or provision to hinder a State from making a commitment of this kind.'\nThibault Moulin\nObviously, this is extremely problematic. Let us imagine, for instance, that the Russians did not carry out a hack-and-leak operation against the DNC, but blackmailed the US President into resigning or directly tampered with the election results. Alternatively, let us imagine that ‘State A’ and ‘State B’ are both competing to sell jet-fighters to ‘State C’. State A decides to infect the electronic systems of the jet-fighters manufactured by State B, in order to cause failures, damage their reputation, end their production and —at the end of the day—win the bid and eliminate a competitor. If these areas are not within the domaine réservé anymore, then even those extreme forms of meddling in the political or economic affairs of another state would not qualify as prohibited interventions.\nAnother problem with the concept of domaine réservé is that it fails to regulate those cyber operations exclusively directed against private actors, even if they are vital to the social[33] and cultural system of a state.[34] For instance, the cyberattacks against Sony Pictures Entertainment (SPE) in 2014 revealed the attempts of foreign governments to meddle with values that are essential to liberal democracies, such as freedom of expression. As a matter of fact, 'the real motive of the operation appears to have been an attempt to prevent the film's global distribution as well as an attempt to deter SPE and other studios from insulting the North Korean regime'.[35] It must be said that this attempt was partially successful, as SPE had to cancel the film's release.[36] This decision was criticised by President Obama himself, who declared:\n[w]e cannot have a society where some dictator someplace can start imposing censorship here in the United States ... Imagine if producers and distributors and others start engaging in self-censorship because they don't want to offend the sensibilities of someone who's sensibilities probably need to be offended.[37]\nYet, and by virtue of the lex lata, the fact that such attacks were exclusively targeting a private company excludes the possibility to describe them in terms of prohibited interventions.[38] And indeed, the US government opted for an\n\nReviving the Principle of Non-Intervention in Cyberspace 433\nalternative term: ‘an act of cyber-vandalism’. Let us imagine that the goal of North Korea was to prompt the adoption of a new law in the USA, which would increase movie censorship. Alternatively, let us imagine that the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) launches a series of attacks against the movie industry in France, to protest the upcoming release of a similar comedy depicting the North Korean regime. They paralyse the movie industry, and studios experience significant economic losses. The goal is to put such pressure on the Minister of Culture that he is forced to refuse to grant the movie a ‘visa d’exploitation’ (ie the authorisation to broadcast a film). If one admits that restrictions to the freedom of expression are still part of the domaine réservé—which is arguably not the case, as human rights conventions usually regulate this area—these attacks are more likely to qualify as interventions because the private actor was only targeted to obtain something from the state. In fact, attacks against the movie industry or newspapers are on the rise, and the resort to ‘criminal hackers’ might just ‘provide a cheap and easy way of censoring the press’. To alleviate this risk, I suggest replacement of the old-fashioned concept of domaine réservé with the newer domaine privilégié.\n## B. The concept of domaine privilégié\nThe objections raised against the concept of domaine réservé are the following: it has been stripped of most of its content and it is maladjusted to the new contribution of non-state actors to the exercise of fundamental freedoms. Consequently, a domaine réservé—based principle of non-interventions fails to protect the free choice and the stability of a political, economic, social or cultural system from foreign attacks. This is where the domaine privilégié comes in, as it appears necessary to opt for a concept with clear-cut contours, which remains unaffected by the development of international law, and protects the fundamental interests of a state and its population. In fact, this concept of\nany attempt to coerce the US government to take a particular course of action’: N Tsagourias, ‘Electoral Cyber Interference, Self-determination and the Principle of Non-intervention in Cyberspace’ (2019) 8 <www.ssrn.com 2020=\"\" abstract=\"3438567\"> accessed 6 February 2020.\n D Chiacu and S Holland, ‘Obama Says Sony Hack Not an Act of War’ Reuters (22 December 2014) <www.reuters.com 2020=\"\" article=\"\" obama-says-sony-hack-not-an-act-of-war-iduskbn0jx1mh20141222=\"\" us-sony-cybersecurity-usa=\"\"> accessed 1 May 2020.\n Code du cinéma et de l’image animée, art L 211-1.\n Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (ECHR) (adopted 4 November 1950, entered into force 3 September 1953) 213 UNTS 22, art 10§2; ICCPR, art 19.\n M Nichols and L Charbonneau, ‘Cyber Attacks Against Media on the Rise, Rights Group Says’ Reuters (15 February 2013) <www.reuters.com 2020=\"\" article=\"\" net-us-media-cyberattacks=\"\" cyber-attacks-against-media-on-the-rise-rights-group-says-idusbre91d1ln20130214=\"\"> accessed 25 February 2020.\n As once underlined by Antonios Tzanakopoulos: ‘[t]hings would be different if it could be shown that states possess a certain bundle of inherent rights which they</www.reuters.com></www.reuters.com></www.ssrn.com>\nThibault Moulin\n'fundamental', 'vital' or 'essential' interests materialises in certain areas of international law and may help theorising the domaine privilégié.\nBy virtue of the protective principle, states may establish jurisdiction over certain crimes that affect their vital interests, irrespective of the place where they occurred, the citizenship of the author or where he/she lives. The protected interests typically include state security and public safety—ie against terrorism, espionage, murder of government officials, hostage-taking—as well as economic and social stability—ie against counterfeiting of currency and various offences, such as 'falsification of official documents, perjury before consular officials, and conspiracy to violate immigration or customs laws'. It is worth noting, thus, that 'the protective principle can be invoked with respect to a far broader range of acts than the rights to self-defence'.\nIn addition, Article 25 of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (DARS) acknowledges the existence of a ground for precluding wrongfulness called 'necessity'. Necessity may be invoked when an otherwise illegal measure 'is the only way for the State to safeguard an essential interest against a grave and imminent peril'. Yet, the International Law Commission (ILC) made clear that 'essential interests' were not restricted to cases where the 'existence' of the state was in danger, highlighting that necessity had also been invoked to prevent 'the extermination of a fur seal\nare not entitled to dispose of freely in the exercise of their sovereignty.'

The early roots of this doctrine can be found in Hobbes’s writings, and it was theorised by authors such as Wolff and Vattel. Wolff considered that nations had a ‘duty of self-preservation’. Hence, ‘every nation ha[d] the right to those means by which it can, as far as possible, avert the peril of destruction and avoid those things which can bring destruction upon it’. Vattel defined certain ‘inalienable rights’ of nations, those required by ‘necessity’ or for its ‘preservation’—and their satisfaction usually justified the use of force. Years later, Gidel thought that states had ‘fundamental’ or ‘inherent’ rights, which were ‘absolute, inviolable and unalienable’, and included ‘preservation, independence, equality, respect, international trade’. Self-preservation actually gained a negative reputation, as it was often ‘the criterion used to justify the rights of states to have recourse to arms’ and ‘for the violation of the rights of other subjects’. Yet, literature of the post-war era reveals an alternative reading of self-preservation, which is more respectful of the rights of other states. For instance, Alfaro highlighted that ‘[s]elf-preservation rests upon the reciprocal\nsupplies of petroleum products, with the resultant dangers for the country’s existence, could therefore seriously affect the public security …’: Campus Oil Limited and others v Minister for Industry and Energy and others (Judgment) [1984] ECR 1984-02727, para 34; E Brosset, ‘Le protectionnisme et le motif de protection de la santé en droit de l’Union européenne’ (Hal, 2014) <https: 942752=\"\" docid=\"\" file=\"\" file/index=\"\" file@unione.europei_enne2.pdf=\"\" docid/942752=\"\" filename=\"\" hal.archives-ouvertes.fr=\"\"> accessed 5 May 2020.\n T Hobbes, Leviathan (1651), pt II, ch XVIII, para 6.

Hence, a nation had allegedly ‘the right of procuring provisions by force’, when a neighbour refused to sell its oversupply, ‘the right of innocent use’ of ‘inexhaustible’ resources, such as water and the sea, as well as the right to ‘force a passage when it [was] unjustly refused’, provided that there was ‘a real necessity [that] oblige[d] you to enter into the territory of others’. It then had the right to make use, ‘either by free consent or by force’, of ‘the ships, waggons, horses, or even the personal labour of foreigners’, and provided that it a ‘pressing want’ and pay ‘a compensation’ for them. Vattel also underlined this ‘right’ for ‘a nation of men’, to ‘procure women, who are absolutely necessary to its preservation’, and to use force if needed, and the right of foreigners to ‘mak[e] a settlement in the first country where they find land enough for themselves, without depriving the inhabitants of what is sufficient for them’.

Yet, in contrast with necessity or the early doctrine of self-preservation, it does not provide justification for breaching the rights of other states, but results in a duty of abstention: states must refrain from meddling with the domaine privilégié of other states. This domaine privilégié includes not only the elements necessary for the very survival of a state but also those that are essential for its independence, autonomy and stability.\nFirst, it protects the political organisation of the state, including the forms of government, the rule of law, personal, collective and political freedoms, as well as the electoral process in full (primary, local and general elections, referenda, etc). Under this new framework, the hack-and-leak operation that targeted the DNC would meddle with the American electoral process and, therefore, with the US domaine privilégié. It would also be affected in the event of cyber operations directed at the movie industry or press organs—like the SPE scenarios—as they seek to restrict the exercise of fundamental freedoms.\nSecondly, it encompasses internal and external security. For instance, the 2015 data breach at the US Office of Personnel Management (OPM) compromised the security of the USA, as it could 'reveal the identities of CIA [Central Intelligence Agency] operatives serving under diplomatic cover'.69 In this case, the domaine privilégié of the USA was obviously affected.\nThirdly, it incorporates major economic interests, ie 'interests so essential that a breach of them threatens the economic ... stability' of the state.70 Key and energy industries, major employers, transports, banking transactions and telecommunications may qualify as such. For instance, and considering that the petrochemical sector 'is a core part of the Saudi economy',71 the cyberattacks against oil companies in Saudi Arabia may affect its domaine privilégié. The same would be true for the 2017 NotPetya attacks, which were aimed at disrupting Ukraine's financial system.72 Insofar as they may provoke the downfall\n\nThibault Moulin\nof the aviation industry in 'State B', the cyberattacks induced by 'State A' in the fictitious example above would also impair the former's domaine privilégié.\nFourthly, it embraces public services, including health and social systems. Hence, state-sponsored attacks against hospitals would obviously affect the domaine privilégié. For instance, in March 2020, the Brno University Hospital had to turn away patients 'suffering serious conditions', and 'urgent surgeries' were postponed following a cyberattack, which shutdown all computers.73 In such situations, the impact on the domaine privilégié is obvious.\nFifthly, the domaine privilégié may extend to the preservation of a state's environment. For example, the 2017 NotPetya attacks also broke the monitoring systems of the nuclear power plant in Chernobyl, and they could have led to long-lasting damage to Ukraine's environment.74\nForeign meddling with this domaine privilégié would be prohibited, unless adopted within the legal framework of countermeasures.75 If the proposed concept of domaine privilégié is clearly de lege ferenda,76 it results from state practice that some governments might actually be sympathetic, for example, to the protection of main economic interests through the principle of non-intervention.77\nworld/national-security/russian-military-was-behind-notpetya-cyberattack-in-ukraine-cia-concludes/2018/01/12/048d8506-f7ca-11e7-b34a-b85626af34ef_story.html&gt; accessed 9 May 2020.\n\nReviving the Principle of Non-Intervention in Cyberspace 439\n# 4. A reconceptualisation of coercion\nIn this section, I will first explain the traditional definition of the concept of coercion, and why it is unsatisfactory in the digital era (Subsection 4A). I then put forward my own reappraisal of the concept of coercion (Subsection 4B).\n## A. The traditional definition of coercion\nCoercion must be equated with the implementation of ‘coercive measures’ or ‘coercive methods’ and must be distinguished from the mere influence or persuasion. In fact, Vattel described interference as an ‘attempt to put a constraint on [the] deliberations’ of another state, whereas Kant put down that ‘[n]o State shall by force interfere with the constitution or government of another State’. The Montevideo Convention on the Rights and Duties of States of 1933 established a duty of non-recognition of situations ‘obtained by force whether this consist[ed] in the employment of arms, in threatening diplomatic representations, or in any other effective coercive measures’. The Charter of the Organization of American States (OAS) prevented states from ‘us[ing] or encouraging[ing] the use of coercive measures of an economic or political character in order to force the sovereign will of another state and obtain from it advantages of any kind’. It also underlined that ‘[n]o territorial acquisitions or special advantages obtained either by force or by other means of coercion shall be recognized’. In the Nicaragua case, the ICJ used the term ‘methods of coercion’. Another question that arises is whether intention is necessary. An analysis of the ICJ case law confirms that intention must be taken into account.\nAssemblée Nationale (France), ‘Première Séance Du Lundi 13 Avril 2015’ (13 April 2015) <www.assemblee-nationale.fr 14=\"\" 14-cri=\"\" 2014-2015=\"\" 20150212.asp#p511027=\"\"> accessed 13 February 2020.

As the Court noted in the Nicaragua case:\n... in international law, if one State, with a view to the coercion of another State, supports and assists armed bands in that State whose purpose is to overthrow the government of that State, that amounts to an intervention by the one State in the internal affairs of the other, whether or not the political objective of the State giving such support and assistance is equally far-reaching.\nIn fact, the Court did not find it necessary ‘to seek to establish whether the intention of the United States to secure a change of governmental policies in Nicaragua went so far as to be equated with an endeavour to overthrow the Nicaraguan Government’. This criterion was not challenged by the judgment pertaining to the Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo. It is true that the Court found that non-intervention was violated ‘even if the objectives of Uganda were not to overthrow President Kabila’, and were intended ‘to securing towns and airports for reason of its perceived security needs, and in support of the parallel activity of those engaged in civil war’. Yet, this position may be explained by the fact that a prohibited use of force was also found. In its traditional sense, coercion thus occurs when a state deploys those means of pressure against another state, which are of a sufficiently serious nature to, and with the intention to, compel the latter to act in a certain way—or to refrain from acting in a certain way—and against its own will. Coercion is not a result-\nS Watts, ‘Low-intensity Cyber Operations and the Principle of Non-intervention’ in JD Ohlin, K Govern and C Finkelstein (eds), *Cyber War: Law and Ethics for Virtual Conflicts* (OUP 2015) 268.\n Nicaragua (n 1) para 241. ‘With a view to the coercion’ was translated in the French version into ‘exercer une pression’ (ie ‘put pressure’).\n ibid. Yet, it was ‘clearly established’ that ‘the United States intended, by its support of the contras, to coerce the Government of Nicaragua’, and ‘that the intention of the contras themselves was to overthrow the present Government of Nicaragua’.\n Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo (n 16).\n ibid, para 163.\n ibid, paras 164 and 165.\n ‘Coercion in inter-State relations involves the government of one State compelling the government of another State to think or act in a certain way by applying various kinds of pressure, threats, intimidation or the use of force’: C Joyner, ‘Coercion’ in R Wolfrum et al (eds), *Max Planck Encyclopaedia of Public International Law* (OUP, online edition, 2006) para 1. ‘Coercion’ is defined by the Black’s Law Dictionary as the ‘compulsion of a free agent by physical, moral, or economic force or threat of physical force’: definition of ‘coercion’, *Black’s Law Dictionary* (10th edn, 2014). The French translation—‘contrainte’—confirms this meaning and may be defined as follows: ‘[a]ction de contraindre, de forcer quelqu’un à agir contre sa volonté; pression morale ou physique, violence exercée sur lui.’ See: Definition of ‘contrainte’ (*Larousse*) &lt;www.larousse.fr/dictionnaires/francais/contrainte/18670#pWqM8QLtC0uMc51R.99&gt; accessed 26 March 2020.

For instance, the ICJ concluded in the Nicaragua case that the principle of non-intervention was breached by the USA even if the attempt at securing political change failed.\nThis understanding of coercion sets a high threshold and most cyber operations do not pass this test. If a state was demanding another one to declare the wrong candidate a winner of the elections, or to declare the favourite candidate ineligible on false grounds, under the threat of launching a debilitating wave of cyberattacks, then the criterion of coercion would be met. Yet, it constitutes a textbook case which will rarely (if ever) happen in practice. In practice, democracy, freedom of expression or the proper functioning of infrastructures (among others) are hindered without a need for ‘compelling’ a state through the deployment of ‘coercive methods’. If Russia’s objective was to help Trump in the case of the DNC, voters or the government were not ‘coerced’ stricto sensu. The former were given stolen information and fake news to persuade them to vote for Donald Trump—or ‘not vote at all’. Then, state-sponsored attacks often take the form of ‘cyber-vandalism’ and would not pass the coercion test either. Let us take two actual examples of attacks against press organs. In April 2015, the French television network TV5Monde was the victim of a cyberattack directed by the so-called ‘CyberCaliphate’, who claimed to belong to the Islamic State. The distribution of programmes was interrupted for hours. Two months later, investigations revealed that the attack was more likely sponsored by Moscow and may constitute nothing more than an act of retaliation in reaction to the French and European measures adopted against\nPellet, Droit International Public (LGDJ 2009) 1025–26; Government (the Netherlands) (n 11).\n Nicaragua (n 1) para 292(3).\n The USA, through the voice of Brian Egan, acknowledged that non-intervention was ‘generally viewed as a relatively narrow rule of customary international law …’.

In a nutshell, it was probably an act of revenge, which did not seek to coerce TV5Monde into doing (or not doing) something. A more recent case is the December 2018 interruption of the distribution of several American newspapers—including The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal—by a cyberattack. The malware used had similarities with Ryuk, which is a ransomware used by North Koreans. Yet, money may not have been the real motive of the attack as, according to some commentators, ‘the intention of the attack was to disable infrastructure, more specifically servers, as opposed to looking to steal information’. It is thus likely that the operation was merely intended to affect the proper functioning of those press organs, rather than obtain any financial benefit. If the motivations behind NotPetya were not entirely made clear, the attacks against the Saudi petrochemical sector were most likely an act of retaliation by Iran.

This may appear, from a certain perspective, as highly unsatisfactory, and it reveals that the concept of ‘coercion’ is in need of a reappraisal, to fit the new peculiarities of cyberattacks.\n## B. The reappraisal of coercion\nAs mentioned above, ‘coercion’ historically occurs ‘when a State deploys those means of pressure against another State, that are of a sufficiently serious nature to, and with the intention to, compel the latter to act in a certain way – or to refrain from acting in a certain way – and against its own will’. Yet, this definition is unsatisfactory in the cyber realm and fails to grasp new types of highly disruptive cyberattacks. Any reappraisal of the coercion is a risky exercise, though, and we must beware of excessively watering down this concept, at the risk of hindering basic interstate relations.\nIn particular, the distinction between plain ‘influence’ and constraint must be maintained. It is likely that states will use the information they obtained through cyberespionage operations to influence the negotiation strategies and decision-making of other states, in line with their own interests. It is also likely that states that suffered cyberattacks or acts of cyberespionage will adapt their internal and external policies, either for the purpose of repairing the damage or for preventing further strikes.

Yet, if we equate ‘coercion’ with ‘attempts at influence’ or with ‘prompting a reaction from another State’, any negotiation process or process that puts a foreign state in a situation where a change of position is required would qualify as prohibited interventions. Since influence seems to be a normal course of international relations, there is a risk that most interstate interactions would be unlawful. This is true both of the digital and physical domains. As once underlined by Switzerland, there is—and I think there must be—a ‘limit between the lawful influence and the unlawful constraint’.\nIt was previously argued that two elements must usually be taken into consideration to make sure that coercion occurred: (i) the resort to means of a sufficiently serious nature; and (ii) the intention of the author.

State A makes a $85 million offer, whereas State B makes a $83 million offer. State A finally wins the contract, after making another offer: $82 million. State A was indeed obliged—due to the lower price proposed by State B—to change its position. Then, let us imagine that the companies based in ‘State D’ manufacture cars and sell them in large quantities abroad. A few years later, companies in ‘State E’ start manufacturing cars to a lower price, and the car industry collapses in State D, prompting the latter in renewing its economic or tax policies. State D indeed had—due to the economic emergence of State E—to review its policies. Let us take a third and last example. State F is a developing country that depends on foreign aid to fund the police. Following a wave of protest, the police in State F fires teargas and rubber bullets on demonstrators. State G—which is a donor—is shocked and decides to halt some aid. To remedy this situation, State F decides to cut education funding. In fact, State G prompted State F into changing its policies. If we equate ‘coercion’ with ‘influence’, these classical situations might result in prohibited interventions—and generate countermeasures in return.

They deprive actors of control and render them powerless instead. With election meddling, citizens are deprived of the possibility of expressing themselves democratically. For instance, the goal of the hack-and-leak operation that targeted the DNC was to reshape the public opinion and ‘represent[ed] the most recent expression of Moscow’s longstanding desire to undermine the US-led liberal democratic order’. Attacks directed at the media industry deprive organs of the possibility to express themselves and deprive citizens of the right to information. NotPetya attacks deprived Ukraine of the possibility to control financial transactions and the radioactivity level at the Chernobyl plant. It is thus necessary, for a reappraisal of coercion, to take those particularities into account. In a digital context, coercion may then be conceptualised as ‘a deprivation of control (1), resulting from the deliberate action of another State, as evidenced prima facie by the characteristics of the malware used (2)’. In my opinion, neither the ability of the targeted actor to prevent the attacks nor its\n Some definitions move in that direction. For instance, the Australian government suggests: ‘[a] prohibited intervention is one that interferes by coercive means (in the sense that they effectively deprive another state of the ability to control, decide upon or govern matters of an inherently sovereign nature) …’. See: Government (Australia) (n 11). I first read it in Harriet Moynihan’s paper, where this definition is discussed: H Moynihan, ‘The Application of International Law to State Cyberattacks’ (Chatham House, 2019) 40–43 <www.chathamhouse.org default=\"\" files=\"\" files/publications=\"\" research=\"\" sites=\"\" research/2019-11-29-intl-law-cyberattacks.pdf=\"\"> accessed 6 February 2020. Robert Jennings and Arthur Watts also suggested: ‘to constitute intervention, the interference must be forcible or dictatorial, or otherwise coercive, in effect depriving the state intervened against of control over the matter in question’. See: Jennings and Watts (n 16) 432.\n Tampering with the electoral results has been described as prohibited interventions by some states, including Australia, Switzerland, the UK and the USA. See: Caflisch (n 11) 105; Attorney General’s Office and Jeremy Wright (UK) (n 8); Egan, ‘Remarks on International Law and Stability in Cyberspace’ (n 11); Government (Australia) (n 11). Describing ballot stuffing in terms of prohibited intervention is however not a new idea. In the 1980s, the US Congress highlighted that ‘[u]nilateral intervention in the internal affairs of other nations is antithetical to democracy. It contravenes international treaties and norms that are vital to the long-term peace and security of all nations in the Hemisphere. Intervention violates the right of self-determination which is the underpinning of every democracy.’ See: United States Congress House Committee on Appropriations Subcommittee on Foreign Operations and Related Agencies Appropriations, Foreign Assistance and Related Programs Appropriations for 1985: Hearings Before a Subcommittee of the Committee on Appropriations, House of Representatives, Ninety-Eighth Congress, Second Session (US Government Printing Office 1984) 662.

It means that a prohibited intervention occurs as soon as these two conditions are met, even if the victim failed to equip itself with state-of-the-art protections, or reacted too late—for instance, due to technical or bureaucratic reasons. In the case of NotPetya, hackers exploited the vulnerabilities of older versions of Windows, for which corrective patches were nonetheless available. In the case of the OPM, 'persistent deficiencies' in the IT security programme had been reported before the data breach and were probably not fixed when it happened. Yet, these deficiencies do not alter the seriousness of the attacks: a deliberate deprivation of control still occurs.\nIt is finally appropriate to touch on the issue of economic cyberespionage. Under the framework put forward in this article, it is clear that only the most severe forms of intellectual property theft (if there are any) would qualify as prohibited interventions—those prone to threatening the economic stability of a state. If this phenomenon is indeed problematic and calls—in my opinion—for legal answers, tailor-made rules are required. In that sense, the Paris Call is interesting, as signatories pledged to '[p]revent ICT-enabled theft of intellectual property, including trade secrets or other confidential business information, with the intent of providing competitive advantages to companies or commercial sector'.\n# 5. Conclusion\nIn this article, I championed the applicability of non-intervention in cyberspace. In my view, such applicability is welcomed by the international community and does not raise theoretical questions about the nature of sovereignty or the militarisation of cyberspace. However, I expressed fears that this principle becomes obsolete if we keep equating 'matters in which each State is permitted, by the principle of State sovereignty, to decide freely' with the notion of domaine réservé. I thus recommended that, for the purpose of non-intervention, we ought to adopt the notion of state domaine privilégié. The latter encompasses the political organisation of a state, its internal and external security, major economic interests and public services (including the health and social systems), as well as the preservation of a state's environment. Then, I turned to the concept of coercion, arguing in favour of a 'balanced' reinterpretation of coercion—ie a\n 'What Is Petya and NotPetya Ransomware' (McAfee) <www.mcafee.com enterprise=\"\" fr-fr=\"\" security-awareness=\"\" ransomware=\"\" petya.html=\"\"> accessed 12 May 2020.\n OPM (the USA), 'Semi-Annual Report to Congress' (2015) <www.opm.gov for=\"\" reports-publications=\"\" semi-annual-reports=\"\" sar52.pdf=\"\" www.opm.gov=\"\"> accessed 12 May 2020; D Auerbach, 'The OPM Breach Is a Catastrophe' Slate (16 June 2015) <https: 06=\"\" 2015=\"\" slate.com=\"\" opm-hack-its-a-catastrophe-heres-how-the-government-can-stop-the-next-one.html=\"\" technology=\"\"> accessed 12 May 2020.\n 'Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace' (n 8).\n Nicaragua (n 1) para 205.</https:></www.opm.gov></www.opm.gov>\nReviving the Principle of Non-Intervention in Cyberspace 447\nreconceptualisation that takes into account situations where states or non-state actors are deprived of control, but does not go as far as equating coercion with influence. This would indeed totally hinder international relations. In the end, it may be argued that a prohibited intervention occurs whenever a state (or a non-state actor located in that state) is deprived of control over matters within the domaine privilégié, due to the deliberate action of another state (as evidenced prima facie by the characteristics of the malware used). Yet, any cyber activity emanating from a state that prompts a given reaction in another state should not automatically be viewed as a prohibited intervention.

In contrast, the relevance of the non-intervention principle is accepted by states and raises less questions about the ‘territoriality’ or the ‘militarization’ of cyberspace. At first sight, it thus appears as a convenient source for the regulation of cyberthreats. However, the *Nicaragua* case also established a stringent test for a foreign interference to qualify as an unlawful intervention. First, it must bear ‘on matters in which each State is permitted, by the principle of State sovereignty to decide freely’ (ie the ‘domaine réservé’). Then, it must involve ‘methods of coercion in regard to such choices’. I contend that both criteria are maladjusted to address cyberthreats and must be reconceptualised. In fact, the *domaine réservé* describes domains where states are free from international rules. However, few domains, including electoral processes or main economic orientations, are totally isolated from international law. I thus argue that it must be reconceptualised into the so-called ‘domaine privilégié’. It consists of a domain with clear-cut contours, unaffected by the developments of international law, which encompasses the fundamental interests of a state and its population. Then, coercion describes situations where a state is compelled to act, or to refrain from acting, in a certain fashion. This traditional approach is also problematic, and I argue that coercion must be understood in terms of deprivation of control.\n## 1. Introduction\nIn his separate opinion attached to the *Nicaragua* case, ICJ President Nagendra Singh felt that he could not ‘conclude this opinion without emphasizing the key\n* Dr Thibault Moulin is a Teaching and Research Assistant at the Université Grenoble-Alpes, France.

In fact, he considered that '[t]o ignore this doctrine is to undermine international order and to promote violence and bloodshed which may prove catastrophic in the end'. More than three decades later, international lawyers' attempts at regulating emerging technologies reveal that the 'principle' of non-intervention might be relevant in situations where there is no risk of 'bloodshed', in a world that lacks flesh and bones: cyberspace. In particular, there has been a renewed interest in this principle since the hack-and-leak operation that targeted the Democratic National Committee (DNC) in 2016 and the alleged interference of Russia in the US elections. If some commentators suggested that Moscow had 'cross[ed] a line', most experts nevertheless came to the conclusion that the so-called 'hack-and-leak' operations were not coercive, and did not constitute a prohibited intervention. The discomfort of the US government with describing this operation as a prohibited intervention was also clear.\nAs a matter of fact,\n\nReviving the Principle of Non-Intervention in Cyberspace 425\nthe ICJ established a 2-fold test to determine the existence (or not) of a prohibited intervention. First, ‘[a] prohibited intervention must … be one bearing on matters in which each State is permitted, by the principle of State sovereignty, to decide freely’. This concept is also known as the ‘domaine réservé’ (reserved domain) of the state. Secondly, a prohibited intervention must use ‘methods of coercion in regard to such choices, which must remain free ones’. It appears that under this stringent test, most cyber operations and attempts at influence will never qualify as prohibited interventions. According to most experts and as suggested above, the main reason is that ‘methods of coercion’ are lacking. I nevertheless argue that this is only part of the problem: in fact, both features are maladjusted to address the characteristics of cyberthreats. My main point, then, is that they must be reconceptualised, and that a new definition of non-intervention in the cyberspace context must be achieved. If we fail to do so, the principle of non-intervention will fall into disuse with regard to cyberthreats. I thus demonstrate that the old-fashioned concept of domaine réservé must be reconceptualised into what I call the ‘domaine privilégié’\nResponse to Russian Malicious Cyber Activity and Harassment’ (29 December 2016) <https: 12=\"\" 2016=\"\" 29=\"\" document-president-actions-response-russian-malicious-cyber-activity=\"\" the-press-office=\"\" obamawhitehouse.archives.gov=\"\"> accessed 3 October 2019. Yet, as underlined by Ryan Goodman, ‘[a]ll official statements by the Obama administration appear to include a studied avoidance of whether the Russian actions do or do not violate international law … It is safe to assume the specific word choice in the President’s statement is highly deliberate.’ See: R Goodman, ‘International Law and the US Response to Russian Election Interference’ (Just Security, 2017) <www.just security.org 35999=\"\" international-law-response-russian-election-interference=\"\"></www.just></https:> accessed 25 November 2019.

France was perhaps the sole exception, as French Minister of Foreign Affairs Ayrault declared at the Parliament that any foreign interference in the presidential campaign of 2017 would constitute ‘a breach of the principle of non-intervention’ that could justify ‘retaliatory measures’. He added: ‘no foreign power is allowed to influence Frenchmen’s choice; no foreign power is allowed to choose the next President of the Republic’.

I also argue in favour of a balanced reinterpretation of the concept of coercion, in order to encompass serious forms of foreign meddling, which deprive actors of control and render them powerless. In the end, the proposed definition is that a prohibited intervention occurs whenever a state (or a non-state actor located in that state) is deprived of control over matters within the domaine privilégié, due to the deliberate action of another state (as evidenced prima facie by the characteristics of the malware used).\nAgainst this background, this article is structured as follows. In the next section, I explain that the principle of non-intervention is clearly applicable in cyberspace. I underline, in particular, that its application to cyberthreats is less controversial than other rules, namely sovereignty or the prohibition to use force—whose implementation in a 'digital' space instead of a 'physical' space remains disputed (Section 2). In the third section, I analyse what is domaine réservé and the reason why this concept is no longer adequate to address cyber activities. In particular, I raise doubts about the current integration of political processes and economic orientations within the domaine réservé, and I contend that it fails to protect those private actors that are vital to the social and cultural system of a state (such as press bodies). I then explain why the notion of domaine réservé should be replaced by the notion of domaine privilégié, what it means and how it would apply to cyberspace (Section 3). In the fourth section, I dwell on the concept of coercion and explain what it means. I underline that the traditional understanding of coercion fails to grasp situations where the state is deprived of its control, and I support a balanced reinterpretation of this concept (Section 4).

It thus offers a well-established and valuable source of regulation in the digital sphere. Then, and contrary to sovereignty and the use of force, the application of non-intervention does not raise the thorny issue of the 'territoriality' of cyberspace. The difficulties in applying these concepts partly reside in the fact that they were conceived to apply in a physical space, in order to prevent trespass onto one's territory or the use of weapons by a state against the territory or the troops of another state. Yet, there is 'deep uncertainty about the treatment of cyberspace as just another physical space, like land, air, or sea - over which States may exercise sovereignty or control'.

It is thus possible to grasp breaches of territorial and political integrity equally. Therefore, a state-sponsored activity can breach the principle of non-intervention, even in the absence of ground, air or naval operations on foreign territory. It is significant, in that sense, that the ICJ underlined that ‘[b]etween independent States, respect for territorial sovereignty is an essential foundation of international relations … and international law requires political integrity\n Nicaragua (n 1) para 205.\n It may be noted that some authors resort to a subtle distinction between ‘non-interference’ and ‘non-intervention’. For instance, Niki Aloupi supports a ‘distinction between non-intervention (territorial integrity) and non-interference (independence and autonomy)’, which is ‘theoretically clear’. See: N Aloupi, ‘The Right to Non-intervention and Non-interference’ (2015) 4(3) Cambridge Journal of International and Comparative Law 566, 572. According to Karine Bannelier and Théodore Christakis, non-intervention ‘refers to the protection of the territory of the State, of its dominium, and that its violation would therefore involve the carrying out of material operations in foreign territory’. In contrast, non-interference ‘would refer to interference, without the authorization of the State, in the sphere of the exercise of its national sovereign powers and would, therefore, affect the imperium of the State’. See: K Bannelier and T Christakis, Cyber-Attacks, Prevention-Reactions: The Role of States and Private Actors (Les Cahiers de la Revue Défense Nationale 2017) 43. See also: P-M Dupuy and Y Kerbrat, Droit International Public (Dalloz 2014), paras 117–19. Yet, and as noted by Michael Wood, ‘in most contexts, the two terms seem to be used interchangeably’. See: M Wood, ‘Non-intervention (Non-interference in Domestic Affairs)’ (Encyclopedia Princetoniensis) <https: 551=\"\" pesd.princeton.edu=\"\" node=\"\"> accessed 15 July 2020. According to some authors, the difference between an interference and an intervention lies elsewhere, in the fact that the sole intervention is coercive and consequently, unlawful. See: R Jennings and A Watts, Oppenheim’s International Law-Vol I: Peace (9th edn, OUP 2008) 432; C Henderson, The Use of Force and International Law (CUP 2018) 51; M Schmitt (ed), Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations (CUP 2017) 313. It may be noted that declarations and case law are of little help to cut a clear distinction between ‘non-intervention’ and ‘non-interference’. The blurring probably culminated in Declaration 2625, which is supposed to contain ‘principles of international law’. It indeed mentioned that ‘[n]o State or group of States has the right to intervene, directly or indirectly, for any reason whatever, in the internal or external affairs of any other State. Consequently, armed intervention and all other forms of interference or attempted threats against the personality of the State or against its political, economic and cultural elements, are in violation of international law.’ See: UNGA Res 2625. In 1986, the ICJ found that ‘[t]he principle of non-intervention involves the right of every sovereign State to conduct its affairs without outside interference’. See: Nicaragua (n 1) para 202. In 2005, the ICJ ruled that ‘Uganda had violated the sovereignty and also the territorial integrity of the DRC. Uganda’s actions equally constituted an interference in the internal affairs of the DRC … The unlawful military intervention by Uganda was of such a magnitude and duration that the Court consider[ed] it to be a grave violation’ of UN Charter’s art 2(4). See: Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo (DRC v Uganda) (Judgment) [2005] ICJ Rep 168, para 165.</https:>\nThibault Moulin\nalso to be respected'. For the sake of clarity, I will use the term 'meddling' to describe 'the act of trying to change or have an influence on things that are not your responsibility', without a legal connotation. In contrast, I will use the term 'intervention' to describe those coercive—and unlawful—activities directed against the internal or external affairs of other states.\n# 3. A reconceptualisation of the domaine réservé\nIn this section, I will first explain the concept of domaine réservé, and why this old-fashioned concept is unsatisfactory in the digital era (Subsection 3A). To alleviate this problem, I argue in favour of a reconceptualisation of the concept into a domaine privilégié (Subsection 3B).\n# A. The concept of domaine réservé\nThe exact wording used by the ICJ in the Nicaragua case to address the first component of a prohibited intervention was the following:\n... the principle forbids all States or groups of States to intervene directly or indirectly in internal or external affairs of other States. A prohibited intervention must accordingly be one bearing on matters in which each State is permitted, by the principle of State sovereignty, to decide freely. One of these is the choice of a political, economic, social and cultural system, and the formulation of foreign policy.[19]\nThis condition is often reconciled with the notion of state domaine réservé, which 'describes areas where States are free from international obligations and regulation'.[20]\nThe challenge with the domaine réservé resides in its shifting contours. In fact, the Permanent Court of International Justice (PCIJ) underlined that '[t]he question whether a certain matter is or is not solely within the jurisdiction of a State [ie if it is part of the domaine réservé] is an essentially relative question; it depends on the development of international relations'.[21] However, few domains are now totally\n\nReviving the Principle of Non-Intervention in Cyberspace 431\nisolated from international law. For instance, states are increasingly constrained in their ability to make free economic decisions. Free-trade agreements—the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), European Economic Area (EEA), North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) and Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), to name just a few—have prospered, and judicial mechanisms have even been created to enforce some of them. Thus, in the current state of international law, most economic questions pulled out of the domaine réservé. But that's not all. States entered into international agreements in the area of electoral process too. From a certain perspective, one might conclude that it is not within the domaine réservé anymore. After all, the ICJ made clear that '[a] State, which is free to decide upon the principle and methods of popular consultation within its domestic order, is sovereign for the purpose of accepting a limitation of its sovereignty in this field'.\n P Kunig, ‘Intervention, Prohibition of’ in R Wolfrum et al (eds), Max Planck Encyclopaedia of Public International Law (OUP, online edition, 2008) para 3; J Verhoeven, ‘Non-intervention: \"Affaires intérieures\" ou \"Vie privée\"?’ in Le droit international au service de la paix, de la justice et du développement: mélanges Michel Virally (Pedone 1991) 497; Ziegler (n 20) para 3.\n See: D Hollis, ‘The Influence of War; the War for Influence’ (2018) 32 Temple International &amp; Comparative Law Journal 31, 40; I Navarette, ‘L’Espionnage en Temps de Paix en Droit International Public’ (2015) 53 Canadian Yearbook of International Law 1, 30.\n General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Adopted on 30 October 1947, entered into force on 1 January 1948) 55 UNTS 194.\n General Agreement on Trade in Services (1869 UNTS 183) Annex 1B of the Marrakech Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization (Adopted on 15 April 1994, entered into force on 1 January 1995).\n European Economic Area Agreement (Adopted on 2 May 1992, entered into force on 1 January 1994).\n North American Free Trade Agreement (Adopted on 17 December 1992, entered into force on 1 January 1994) 32 ILM 289.\n ASEAN Free Trade Area Agreement (Adopted on 28 January 1992, entered into force 1 January 2003).\n Treaty Establishing the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (Adopted on 5 November 1993, entered into force on 8 December 1994) 33 ILM 1067.\n For instance, the European Court of Justice (ECJ), the WTO Appellate Body and the COMESA Court of Justice.\n For instance, electoral rights of citizens are protected under art 25 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). See: ICCPR (adopted 16 December 1966, entered into force 23 March 1976) 999 UNTS 171, art 25; ‘General Comment No. 25: The Right to Participate in Public Affairs, Voting Rights and the Right of Equal Access to Public Service’ (art 25) (1996) CCPR/C/21/Rev.1/Add.7.\n Nicaragua (n 1) para 259. The ICJ previously mentioned: '[h]owever, the assertion of a commitment raises the question of the possibility of a State binding itself by agreement in relation to a question of domestic policy, such as that relating to the holding of free elections on its territory. The Court cannot discover, within the range of subjects open to international agreement, any obstacle or provision to hinder a State from making a commitment of this kind.'\nThibault Moulin\nObviously, this is extremely problematic. Let us imagine, for instance, that the Russians did not carry out a hack-and-leak operation against the DNC, but blackmailed the US President into resigning or directly tampered with the election results. Alternatively, let us imagine that ‘State A’ and ‘State B’ are both competing to sell jet-fighters to ‘State C’. State A decides to infect the electronic systems of the jet-fighters manufactured by State B, in order to cause failures, damage their reputation, end their production and —at the end of the day—win the bid and eliminate a competitor. If these areas are not within the domaine réservé anymore, then even those extreme forms of meddling in the political or economic affairs of another state would not qualify as prohibited interventions.\nAnother problem with the concept of domaine réservé is that it fails to regulate those cyber operations exclusively directed against private actors, even if they are vital to the social[33] and cultural system of a state.[34] For instance, the cyberattacks against Sony Pictures Entertainment (SPE) in 2014 revealed the attempts of foreign governments to meddle with values that are essential to liberal democracies, such as freedom of expression. As a matter of fact, 'the real motive of the operation appears to have been an attempt to prevent the film's global distribution as well as an attempt to deter SPE and other studios from insulting the North Korean regime'.[35] It must be said that this attempt was partially successful, as SPE had to cancel the film's release.[36] This decision was criticised by President Obama himself, who declared:\n[w]e cannot have a society where some dictator someplace can start imposing censorship here in the United States ... Imagine if producers and distributors and others start engaging in self-censorship because they don't want to offend the sensibilities of someone who's sensibilities probably need to be offended.[37]\nYet, and by virtue of the lex lata, the fact that such attacks were exclusively targeting a private company excludes the possibility to describe them in terms of prohibited interventions.[38] And indeed, the US government opted for an\n\nReviving the Principle of Non-Intervention in Cyberspace 433\nalternative term: ‘an act of cyber-vandalism’. Let us imagine that the goal of North Korea was to prompt the adoption of a new law in the USA, which would increase movie censorship. Alternatively, let us imagine that the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) launches a series of attacks against the movie industry in France, to protest the upcoming release of a similar comedy depicting the North Korean regime. They paralyse the movie industry, and studios experience significant economic losses. The goal is to put such pressure on the Minister of Culture that he is forced to refuse to grant the movie a ‘visa d’exploitation’ (ie the authorisation to broadcast a film). If one admits that restrictions to the freedom of expression are still part of the domaine réservé—which is arguably not the case, as human rights conventions usually regulate this area—these attacks are more likely to qualify as interventions because the private actor was only targeted to obtain something from the state. In fact, attacks against the movie industry or newspapers are on the rise, and the resort to ‘criminal hackers’ might just ‘provide a cheap and easy way of censoring the press’. To alleviate this risk, I suggest replacement of the old-fashioned concept of domaine réservé with the newer domaine privilégié.\n## B. The concept of domaine privilégié\nThe objections raised against the concept of domaine réservé are the following: it has been stripped of most of its content and it is maladjusted to the new contribution of non-state actors to the exercise of fundamental freedoms. Consequently, a domaine réservé—based principle of non-interventions fails to protect the free choice and the stability of a political, economic, social or cultural system from foreign attacks. This is where the domaine privilégié comes in, as it appears necessary to opt for a concept with clear-cut contours, which remains unaffected by the development of international law, and protects the fundamental interests of a state and its population. In fact, this concept of\nany attempt to coerce the US government to take a particular course of action’: N Tsagourias, ‘Electoral Cyber Interference, Self-determination and the Principle of Non-intervention in Cyberspace’ (2019) 8 <www.ssrn.com 2020=\"\" abstract=\"3438567\"> accessed 6 February 2020.\n D Chiacu and S Holland, ‘Obama Says Sony Hack Not an Act of War’ Reuters (22 December 2014) <www.reuters.com 2020=\"\" article=\"\" obama-says-sony-hack-not-an-act-of-war-iduskbn0jx1mh20141222=\"\" us-sony-cybersecurity-usa=\"\"> accessed 1 May 2020.\n Code du cinéma et de l’image animée, art L 211-1.\n Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (ECHR) (adopted 4 November 1950, entered into force 3 September 1953) 213 UNTS 22, art 10§2; ICCPR, art 19.\n M Nichols and L Charbonneau, ‘Cyber Attacks Against Media on the Rise, Rights Group Says’ Reuters (15 February 2013) <www.reuters.com 2020=\"\" article=\"\" net-us-media-cyberattacks=\"\" cyber-attacks-against-media-on-the-rise-rights-group-says-idusbre91d1ln20130214=\"\"> accessed 25 February 2020.\n As once underlined by Antonios Tzanakopoulos: ‘[t]hings would be different if it could be shown that states possess a certain bundle of inherent rights which they</www.reuters.com></www.reuters.com></www.ssrn.com>\nThibault Moulin\n'fundamental', 'vital' or 'essential' interests materialises in certain areas of international law and may help theorising the domaine privilégié.\nBy virtue of the protective principle, states may establish jurisdiction over certain crimes that affect their vital interests, irrespective of the place where they occurred, the citizenship of the author or where he/she lives. The protected interests typically include state security and public safety—ie against terrorism, espionage, murder of government officials, hostage-taking—as well as economic and social stability—ie against counterfeiting of currency and various offences, such as 'falsification of official documents, perjury before consular officials, and conspiracy to violate immigration or customs laws'. It is worth noting, thus, that 'the protective principle can be invoked with respect to a far broader range of acts than the rights to self-defence'.\nIn addition, Article 25 of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (DARS) acknowledges the existence of a ground for precluding wrongfulness called 'necessity'. Necessity may be invoked when an otherwise illegal measure 'is the only way for the State to safeguard an essential interest against a grave and imminent peril'. Yet, the International Law Commission (ILC) made clear that 'essential interests' were not restricted to cases where the 'existence' of the state was in danger, highlighting that necessity had also been invoked to prevent 'the extermination of a fur seal\nare not entitled to dispose of freely in the exercise of their sovereignty.'

The early roots of this doctrine can be found in Hobbes’s writings, and it was theorised by authors such as Wolff and Vattel. Wolff considered that nations had a ‘duty of self-preservation’. Hence, ‘every nation ha[d] the right to those means by which it can, as far as possible, avert the peril of destruction and avoid those things which can bring destruction upon it’. Vattel defined certain ‘inalienable rights’ of nations, those required by ‘necessity’ or for its ‘preservation’—and their satisfaction usually justified the use of force. Years later, Gidel thought that states had ‘fundamental’ or ‘inherent’ rights, which were ‘absolute, inviolable and unalienable’, and included ‘preservation, independence, equality, respect, international trade’. Self-preservation actually gained a negative reputation, as it was often ‘the criterion used to justify the rights of states to have recourse to arms’ and ‘for the violation of the rights of other subjects’. Yet, literature of the post-war era reveals an alternative reading of self-preservation, which is more respectful of the rights of other states. For instance, Alfaro highlighted that ‘[s]elf-preservation rests upon the reciprocal\nsupplies of petroleum products, with the resultant dangers for the country’s existence, could therefore seriously affect the public security …’: Campus Oil Limited and others v Minister for Industry and Energy and others (Judgment) [1984] ECR 1984-02727, para 34; E Brosset, ‘Le protectionnisme et le motif de protection de la santé en droit de l’Union européenne’ (Hal, 2014) <https: 942752=\"\" docid=\"\" file=\"\" file/index=\"\" file@unione.europei_enne2.pdf=\"\" docid/942752=\"\" filename=\"\" hal.archives-ouvertes.fr=\"\"> accessed 5 May 2020.\n T Hobbes, Leviathan (1651), pt II, ch XVIII, para 6.

Hence, a nation had allegedly ‘the right of procuring provisions by force’, when a neighbour refused to sell its oversupply, ‘the right of innocent use’ of ‘inexhaustible’ resources, such as water and the sea, as well as the right to ‘force a passage when it [was] unjustly refused’, provided that there was ‘a real necessity [that] oblige[d] you to enter into the territory of others’. It then had the right to make use, ‘either by free consent or by force’, of ‘the ships, waggons, horses, or even the personal labour of foreigners’, and provided that it a ‘pressing want’ and pay ‘a compensation’ for them. Vattel also underlined this ‘right’ for ‘a nation of men’, to ‘procure women, who are absolutely necessary to its preservation’, and to use force if needed, and the right of foreigners to ‘mak[e] a settlement in the first country where they find land enough for themselves, without depriving the inhabitants of what is sufficient for them’.

Yet, in contrast with necessity or the early doctrine of self-preservation, it does not provide justification for breaching the rights of other states, but results in a duty of abstention: states must refrain from meddling with the domaine privilégié of other states. This domaine privilégié includes not only the elements necessary for the very survival of a state but also those that are essential for its independence, autonomy and stability.\nFirst, it protects the political organisation of the state, including the forms of government, the rule of law, personal, collective and political freedoms, as well as the electoral process in full (primary, local and general elections, referenda, etc). Under this new framework, the hack-and-leak operation that targeted the DNC would meddle with the American electoral process and, therefore, with the US domaine privilégié. It would also be affected in the event of cyber operations directed at the movie industry or press organs—like the SPE scenarios—as they seek to restrict the exercise of fundamental freedoms.\nSecondly, it encompasses internal and external security. For instance, the 2015 data breach at the US Office of Personnel Management (OPM) compromised the security of the USA, as it could 'reveal the identities of CIA [Central Intelligence Agency] operatives serving under diplomatic cover'.69 In this case, the domaine privilégié of the USA was obviously affected.\nThirdly, it incorporates major economic interests, ie 'interests so essential that a breach of them threatens the economic ... stability' of the state.70 Key and energy industries, major employers, transports, banking transactions and telecommunications may qualify as such. For instance, and considering that the petrochemical sector 'is a core part of the Saudi economy',71 the cyberattacks against oil companies in Saudi Arabia may affect its domaine privilégié. The same would be true for the 2017 NotPetya attacks, which were aimed at disrupting Ukraine's financial system.72 Insofar as they may provoke the downfall\n\nThibault Moulin\nof the aviation industry in 'State B', the cyberattacks induced by 'State A' in the fictitious example above would also impair the former's domaine privilégié.\nFourthly, it embraces public services, including health and social systems. Hence, state-sponsored attacks against hospitals would obviously affect the domaine privilégié. For instance, in March 2020, the Brno University Hospital had to turn away patients 'suffering serious conditions', and 'urgent surgeries' were postponed following a cyberattack, which shutdown all computers.73 In such situations, the impact on the domaine privilégié is obvious.\nFifthly, the domaine privilégié may extend to the preservation of a state's environment. For example, the 2017 NotPetya attacks also broke the monitoring systems of the nuclear power plant in Chernobyl, and they could have led to long-lasting damage to Ukraine's environment.74\nForeign meddling with this domaine privilégié would be prohibited, unless adopted within the legal framework of countermeasures.75 If the proposed concept of domaine privilégié is clearly de lege ferenda,76 it results from state practice that some governments might actually be sympathetic, for example, to the protection of main economic interests through the principle of non-intervention.77\nworld/national-security/russian-military-was-behind-notpetya-cyberattack-in-ukraine-cia-concludes/2018/01/12/048d8506-f7ca-11e7-b34a-b85626af34ef_story.html&gt; accessed 9 May 2020.\n\nReviving the Principle of Non-Intervention in Cyberspace 439\n# 4. A reconceptualisation of coercion\nIn this section, I will first explain the traditional definition of the concept of coercion, and why it is unsatisfactory in the digital era (Subsection 4A). I then put forward my own reappraisal of the concept of coercion (Subsection 4B).\n## A. The traditional definition of coercion\nCoercion must be equated with the implementation of ‘coercive measures’ or ‘coercive methods’ and must be distinguished from the mere influence or persuasion. In fact, Vattel described interference as an ‘attempt to put a constraint on [the] deliberations’ of another state, whereas Kant put down that ‘[n]o State shall by force interfere with the constitution or government of another State’. The Montevideo Convention on the Rights and Duties of States of 1933 established a duty of non-recognition of situations ‘obtained by force whether this consist[ed] in the employment of arms, in threatening diplomatic representations, or in any other effective coercive measures’. The Charter of the Organization of American States (OAS) prevented states from ‘us[ing] or encouraging[ing] the use of coercive measures of an economic or political character in order to force the sovereign will of another state and obtain from it advantages of any kind’. It also underlined that ‘[n]o territorial acquisitions or special advantages obtained either by force or by other means of coercion shall be recognized’. In the Nicaragua case, the ICJ used the term ‘methods of coercion’. Another question that arises is whether intention is necessary. An analysis of the ICJ case law confirms that intention must be taken into account.\nAssemblée Nationale (France), ‘Première Séance Du Lundi 13 Avril 2015’ (13 April 2015) <www.assemblee-nationale.fr 14=\"\" 14-cri=\"\" 2014-2015=\"\" 20150212.asp#p511027=\"\"> accessed 13 February 2020.

As the Court noted in the Nicaragua case:\n... in international law, if one State, with a view to the coercion of another State, supports and assists armed bands in that State whose purpose is to overthrow the government of that State, that amounts to an intervention by the one State in the internal affairs of the other, whether or not the political objective of the State giving such support and assistance is equally far-reaching.\nIn fact, the Court did not find it necessary ‘to seek to establish whether the intention of the United States to secure a change of governmental policies in Nicaragua went so far as to be equated with an endeavour to overthrow the Nicaraguan Government’. This criterion was not challenged by the judgment pertaining to the Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo. It is true that the Court found that non-intervention was violated ‘even if the objectives of Uganda were not to overthrow President Kabila’, and were intended ‘to securing towns and airports for reason of its perceived security needs, and in support of the parallel activity of those engaged in civil war’. Yet, this position may be explained by the fact that a prohibited use of force was also found. In its traditional sense, coercion thus occurs when a state deploys those means of pressure against another state, which are of a sufficiently serious nature to, and with the intention to, compel the latter to act in a certain way—or to refrain from acting in a certain way—and against its own will. Coercion is not a result-\nS Watts, ‘Low-intensity Cyber Operations and the Principle of Non-intervention’ in JD Ohlin, K Govern and C Finkelstein (eds), *Cyber War: Law and Ethics for Virtual Conflicts* (OUP 2015) 268.\n Nicaragua (n 1) para 241. ‘With a view to the coercion’ was translated in the French version into ‘exercer une pression’ (ie ‘put pressure’).\n ibid. Yet, it was ‘clearly established’ that ‘the United States intended, by its support of the contras, to coerce the Government of Nicaragua’, and ‘that the intention of the contras themselves was to overthrow the present Government of Nicaragua’.\n Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo (n 16).\n ibid, para 163.\n ibid, paras 164 and 165.\n ‘Coercion in inter-State relations involves the government of one State compelling the government of another State to think or act in a certain way by applying various kinds of pressure, threats, intimidation or the use of force’: C Joyner, ‘Coercion’ in R Wolfrum et al (eds), *Max Planck Encyclopaedia of Public International Law* (OUP, online edition, 2006) para 1. ‘Coercion’ is defined by the Black’s Law Dictionary as the ‘compulsion of a free agent by physical, moral, or economic force or threat of physical force’: definition of ‘coercion’, *Black’s Law Dictionary* (10th edn, 2014). The French translation—‘contrainte’—confirms this meaning and may be defined as follows: ‘[a]ction de contraindre, de forcer quelqu’un à agir contre sa volonté; pression morale ou physique, violence exercée sur lui.’ See: Definition of ‘contrainte’ (*Larousse*) &lt;www.larousse.fr/dictionnaires/francais/contrainte/18670#pWqM8QLtC0uMc51R.99&gt; accessed 26 March 2020.

For instance, the ICJ concluded in the Nicaragua case that the principle of non-intervention was breached by the USA even if the attempt at securing political change failed.\nThis understanding of coercion sets a high threshold and most cyber operations do not pass this test. If a state was demanding another one to declare the wrong candidate a winner of the elections, or to declare the favourite candidate ineligible on false grounds, under the threat of launching a debilitating wave of cyberattacks, then the criterion of coercion would be met. Yet, it constitutes a textbook case which will rarely (if ever) happen in practice. In practice, democracy, freedom of expression or the proper functioning of infrastructures (among others) are hindered without a need for ‘compelling’ a state through the deployment of ‘coercive methods’. If Russia’s objective was to help Trump in the case of the DNC, voters or the government were not ‘coerced’ stricto sensu. The former were given stolen information and fake news to persuade them to vote for Donald Trump—or ‘not vote at all’. Then, state-sponsored attacks often take the form of ‘cyber-vandalism’ and would not pass the coercion test either. Let us take two actual examples of attacks against press organs. In April 2015, the French television network TV5Monde was the victim of a cyberattack directed by the so-called ‘CyberCaliphate’, who claimed to belong to the Islamic State. The distribution of programmes was interrupted for hours. Two months later, investigations revealed that the attack was more likely sponsored by Moscow and may constitute nothing more than an act of retaliation in reaction to the French and European measures adopted against\nPellet, Droit International Public (LGDJ 2009) 1025–26; Government (the Netherlands) (n 11).\n Nicaragua (n 1) para 292(3).\n The USA, through the voice of Brian Egan, acknowledged that non-intervention was ‘generally viewed as a relatively narrow rule of customary international law …’.

In a nutshell, it was probably an act of revenge, which did not seek to coerce TV5Monde into doing (or not doing) something. A more recent case is the December 2018 interruption of the distribution of several American newspapers—including The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal—by a cyberattack. The malware used had similarities with Ryuk, which is a ransomware used by North Koreans. Yet, money may not have been the real motive of the attack as, according to some commentators, ‘the intention of the attack was to disable infrastructure, more specifically servers, as opposed to looking to steal information’. It is thus likely that the operation was merely intended to affect the proper functioning of those press organs, rather than obtain any financial benefit. If the motivations behind NotPetya were not entirely made clear, the attacks against the Saudi petrochemical sector were most likely an act of retaliation by Iran.

This may appear, from a certain perspective, as highly unsatisfactory, and it reveals that the concept of ‘coercion’ is in need of a reappraisal, to fit the new peculiarities of cyberattacks.\n## B. The reappraisal of coercion\nAs mentioned above, ‘coercion’ historically occurs ‘when a State deploys those means of pressure against another State, that are of a sufficiently serious nature to, and with the intention to, compel the latter to act in a certain way – or to refrain from acting in a certain way – and against its own will’. Yet, this definition is unsatisfactory in the cyber realm and fails to grasp new types of highly disruptive cyberattacks. Any reappraisal of the coercion is a risky exercise, though, and we must beware of excessively watering down this concept, at the risk of hindering basic interstate relations.\nIn particular, the distinction between plain ‘influence’ and constraint must be maintained. It is likely that states will use the information they obtained through cyberespionage operations to influence the negotiation strategies and decision-making of other states, in line with their own interests. It is also likely that states that suffered cyberattacks or acts of cyberespionage will adapt their internal and external policies, either for the purpose of repairing the damage or for preventing further strikes. For instance, after the revelations on mass surveillance of the National Security Agency (NSA), Germany did not want to depend on US technologies anymore and decided to create a new agency to\n The principle of due diligence might however be relevant to address those situations.

Yet, if we equate ‘coercion’ with ‘attempts at influence’ or with ‘prompting a reaction from another State’, any negotiation process or process that puts a foreign state in a situation where a change of position is required would qualify as prohibited interventions. Since influence seems to be a normal course of international relations, there is a risk that most interstate interactions would be unlawful. This is true both of the digital and physical domains. As once underlined by Switzerland, there is—and I think there must be—a ‘limit between the lawful influence and the unlawful constraint’.\nIt was previously argued that two elements must usually be taken into consideration to make sure that coercion occurred: (i) the resort to means of a sufficiently serious nature; and (ii) the intention of the author.

State A makes a $85 million offer, whereas State B makes a $83 million offer. State A finally wins the contract, after making another offer: $82 million. State A was indeed obliged—due to the lower price proposed by State B—to change its position. Then, let us imagine that the companies based in ‘State D’ manufacture cars and sell them in large quantities abroad. A few years later, companies in ‘State E’ start manufacturing cars to a lower price, and the car industry collapses in State D, prompting the latter in renewing its economic or tax policies. State D indeed had—due to the economic emergence of State E—to review its policies. Let us take a third and last example. State F is a developing country that depends on foreign aid to fund the police. Following a wave of protest, the police in State F fires teargas and rubber bullets on demonstrators. State G—which is a donor—is shocked and decides to halt some aid. To remedy this situation, State F decides to cut education funding. In fact, State G prompted State F into changing its policies.

They deprive actors of control and render them powerless instead. With election meddling, citizens are deprived of the possibility of expressing themselves democratically. For instance, the goal of the hack-and-leak operation that targeted the DNC was to reshape the public opinion and ‘represent[ed] the most recent expression of Moscow’s longstanding desire to undermine the US-led liberal democratic order’. Attacks directed at the media industry deprive organs of the possibility to express themselves and deprive citizens of the right to information. NotPetya attacks deprived Ukraine of the possibility to control financial transactions and the radioactivity level at the Chernobyl plant. It is thus necessary, for a reappraisal of coercion, to take those particularities into account. In a digital context, coercion may then be conceptualised as ‘a deprivation of control (1), resulting from the deliberate action of another State, as evidenced prima facie by the characteristics of the malware used (2)’. In my opinion, neither the ability of the targeted actor to prevent the attacks nor its\n Some definitions move in that direction. For instance, the Australian government suggests: ‘[a] prohibited intervention is one that interferes by coercive means (in the sense that they effectively deprive another state of the ability to control, decide upon or govern matters of an inherently sovereign nature) …’. See: Government (Australia) (n 11). I first read it in Harriet Moynihan’s paper, where this definition is discussed: H Moynihan, ‘The Application of International Law to State Cyberattacks’ (Chatham House, 2019) 40–43 <www.chathamhouse.org default=\"\" files=\"\" files/publications=\"\" research=\"\" sites=\"\" research/2019-11-29-intl-law-cyberattacks.pdf=\"\"> accessed 6 February 2020. Robert Jennings and Arthur Watts also suggested: ‘to constitute intervention, the interference must be forcible or dictatorial, or otherwise coercive, in effect depriving the state intervened against of control over the matter in question’. See: Jennings and Watts (n 16) 432.\n Tampering with the electoral results has been described as prohibited interventions by some states, including Australia, Switzerland, the UK and the USA. See: Caflisch (n 11) 105; Attorney General’s Office and Jeremy Wright (UK) (n 8); Egan, ‘Remarks on International Law and Stability in Cyberspace’ (n 11); Government (Australia) (n 11). Describing ballot stuffing in terms of prohibited intervention is however not a new idea. In the 1980s, the US Congress highlighted that ‘[u]nilateral intervention in the internal affairs of other nations is antithetical to democracy. It contravenes international treaties and norms that are vital to the long-term peace and security of all nations in the Hemisphere. Intervention violates the right of self-determination which is the underpinning of every democracy.’ See: United States Congress House Committee on Appropriations Subcommittee on Foreign Operations and Related Agencies Appropriations, Foreign Assistance and Related Programs Appropriations for 1985: Hearings Before a Subcommittee of the Committee on Appropriations, House of Representatives, Ninety-Eighth Congress, Second Session (US Government Printing Office 1984) 662. Experts now suggest that doxfare might be at odd with self-determination, but clearly disagree as to whether it also constitutes a prohibited intervention.

It means that a prohibited intervention occurs as soon as these two conditions are met, even if the victim failed to equip itself with state-of-the-art protections, or reacted too late—for instance, due to technical or bureaucratic reasons. In the case of NotPetya, hackers exploited the vulnerabilities of older versions of Windows, for which corrective patches were nonetheless available. In the case of the OPM, 'persistent deficiencies' in the IT security programme had been reported before the data breach and were probably not fixed when it happened. Yet, these deficiencies do not alter the seriousness of the attacks: a deliberate deprivation of control still occurs.\nIt is finally appropriate to touch on the issue of economic cyberespionage. Under the framework put forward in this article, it is clear that only the most severe forms of intellectual property theft (if there are any) would qualify as prohibited interventions—those prone to threatening the economic stability of a state. If this phenomenon is indeed problematic and calls—in my opinion—for legal answers, tailor-made rules are required. In that sense, the Paris Call is interesting, as signatories pledged to '[p]revent ICT-enabled theft of intellectual property, including trade secrets or other confidential business information, with the intent of providing competitive advantages to companies or commercial sector'.\n# 5. Conclusion\nIn this article, I championed the applicability of non-intervention in cyberspace. In my view, such applicability is welcomed by the international community and does not raise theoretical questions about the nature of sovereignty or the militarisation of cyberspace. However, I expressed fears that this principle becomes obsolete if we keep equating 'matters in which each State is permitted, by the principle of State sovereignty, to decide freely' with the notion of domaine réservé. I thus recommended that, for the purpose of non-intervention, we ought to adopt the notion of state domaine privilégié. The latter encompasses the political organisation of a state, its internal and external security, major economic interests and public services (including the health and social systems), as well as the preservation of a state's environment. Then, I turned to the concept of coercion, arguing in favour of a 'balanced' reinterpretation of coercion—ie a\n 'What Is Petya and NotPetya Ransomware' (McAfee) <www.mcafee.com enterprise=\"\" fr-fr=\"\" security-awareness=\"\" ransomware=\"\" petya.html=\"\"> accessed 12 May 2020.\n OPM (the USA), 'Semi-Annual Report to Congress' (2015) <www.opm.gov for=\"\" reports-publications=\"\" semi-annual-reports=\"\" sar52.pdf=\"\" www.opm.gov=\"\"> accessed 12 May 2020; D Auerbach, 'The OPM Breach Is a Catastrophe' Slate (16 June 2015) <https: 06=\"\" 2015=\"\" slate.com=\"\" opm-hack-its-a-catastrophe-heres-how-the-government-can-stop-the-next-one.html=\"\" technology=\"\"> accessed 12 May 2020.\n 'Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace' (n 8).\n Nicaragua (n 1) para 205.</https:></www.opm.gov></www.opm.gov>\nReviving the Principle of Non-Intervention in Cyberspace 447\nreconceptualisation that takes into account situations where states or non-state actors are deprived of control, but does not go as far as equating coercion with influence. This would indeed totally hinder international relations. In the end, it may be argued that a prohibited intervention occurs whenever a state (or a non-state actor located in that state) is deprived of control over matters within the domaine privilégié, due to the deliberate action of another state (as evidenced prima facie by the characteristics of the malware used). Yet, any cyber activity emanating from a state that prompts a given reaction in another state should not automatically be viewed as a prohibited intervention. After all—and as well illustrated by Denmark—‘[a]s hacker groups continuously perfect their technical skills and capabilities, state institutions will be forced to heighten their security levels and are thus engaged in a constant cyber-race.’\n Centre for Cybersecurity (Denmark), ‘The Cyber Threat Against Denmark’ (2016) 4 <https: cfcs=\"\" cfcsdocuments=\"\" cfcsdocuments=\"\" threat%20assessment%20-%20the%20cyber%20threat%20against%20denmark.pdf=\"\" fe-ddis.dk=\"\"> accessed 29 February 2020.</https:>\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jcsl/article/25/3/423/5879500 by Eastman Dental Institute user on 03 July 2025",

State A makes a $85 million offer, whereas State B makes a $83 million offer. State A finally wins the contract, after making another offer: $82 million. State A was indeed obliged—due to the lower price proposed by State B—to change its position. Then, let us imagine that the companies based in ‘State D’ manufacture cars and sell them in large quantities abroad. A few years later, companies in ‘State E’ start manufacturing cars to a lower price, and the car industry collapses in State D, prompting the latter in renewing its economic or tax policies. State D indeed had—due to the economic emergence of State E—to review its policies. Let us take a third and last example. State F is a developing country that depends on foreign aid to fund the police. Following a wave of protest, the police in State F fires teargas and rubber bullets on demonstrators. State G—which is a donor—is shocked and decides to halt some aid. To remedy this situation, State F decides to cut education funding. In fact, State G prompted State F into changing its policies.

In contrast, the relevance of the non-intervention principle is accepted by states and raises less questions about the ‘territoriality’ or the ‘militarization’ of cyberspace. At first sight, it thus appears as a convenient source for the regulation of cyberthreats. However, the *Nicaragua* case also established a stringent test for a foreign interference to qualify as an unlawful intervention. First, it must bear ‘on matters in which each State is permitted, by the principle of State sovereignty to decide freely’ (ie the ‘domaine réservé’). Then, it must involve ‘methods of coercion in regard to such choices’. I contend that both criteria are maladjusted to address cyberthreats and must be reconceptualised. In fact, the *domaine réservé* describes domains where states are free from international rules. However, few domains, including electoral processes or main economic orientations, are totally isolated from international law. I thus argue that it must be reconceptualised into the so-called ‘domaine privilégié’. It consists of a domain with clear-cut contours, unaffected by the developments of international law, which encompasses the fundamental interests of a state and its population. Then, coercion describes situations where a state is compelled to act, or to refrain from acting, in a certain fashion. This traditional approach is also problematic, and I argue that coercion must be understood in terms of deprivation of control.\n## 1. Introduction\nIn his separate opinion attached to the *Nicaragua* case, ICJ President Nagendra Singh felt that he could not ‘conclude this opinion without emphasizing the key\n* Dr Thibault Moulin is a Teaching and Research Assistant at the Université Grenoble-Alpes, France.

In fact, he considered that '[t]o ignore this doctrine is to undermine international order and to promote violence and bloodshed which may prove catastrophic in the end'. More than three decades later, international lawyers' attempts at regulating emerging technologies reveal that the 'principle' of non-intervention might be relevant in situations where there is no risk of 'bloodshed', in a world that lacks flesh and bones: cyberspace. In particular, there has been a renewed interest in this principle since the hack-and-leak operation that targeted the Democratic National Committee (DNC) in 2016 and the alleged interference of Russia in the US elections. If some commentators suggested that Moscow had 'cross[ed] a line', most experts nevertheless came to the conclusion that the so-called 'hack-and-leak' operations were not coercive, and did not constitute a prohibited intervention. The discomfort of the US government with describing this operation as a prohibited intervention was also clear.\nAs a matter of fact,\n\nReviving the Principle of Non-Intervention in Cyberspace 425\nthe ICJ established a 2-fold test to determine the existence (or not) of a prohibited intervention. First, ‘[a] prohibited intervention must … be one bearing on matters in which each State is permitted, by the principle of State sovereignty, to decide freely’. This concept is also known as the ‘domaine réservé’ (reserved domain) of the state. Secondly, a prohibited intervention must use ‘methods of coercion in regard to such choices, which must remain free ones’. It appears that under this stringent test, most cyber operations and attempts at influence will never qualify as prohibited interventions. According to most experts and as suggested above, the main reason is that ‘methods of coercion’ are lacking. I nevertheless argue that this is only part of the problem: in fact, both features are maladjusted to address the characteristics of cyberthreats. My main point, then, is that they must be reconceptualised, and that a new definition of non-intervention in the cyberspace context must be achieved. If we fail to do so, the principle of non-intervention will fall into disuse with regard to cyberthreats. I thus demonstrate that the old-fashioned concept of domaine réservé must be reconceptualised into what I call the ‘domaine privilégié’\nResponse to Russian Malicious Cyber Activity and Harassment’ (29 December 2016) <https: 12=\"\" 2016=\"\" 29=\"\" document-president-actions-response-russian-malicious-cyber-activity=\"\" the-press-office=\"\" obamawhitehouse.archives.gov=\"\"> accessed 3 October 2019.

France was perhaps the sole exception, as French Minister of Foreign Affairs Ayrault declared at the Parliament that any foreign interference in the presidential campaign of 2017 would constitute ‘a breach of the principle of non-intervention’ that could justify ‘retaliatory measures’. He added: ‘no foreign power is allowed to influence Frenchmen’s choice; no foreign power is allowed to choose the next President of the Republic’.

I also argue in favour of a balanced reinterpretation of the concept of coercion, in order to encompass serious forms of foreign meddling, which deprive actors of control and render them powerless. In the end, the proposed definition is that a prohibited intervention occurs whenever a state (or a non-state actor located in that state) is deprived of control over matters within the domaine privilégié, due to the deliberate action of another state (as evidenced prima facie by the characteristics of the malware used).\nAgainst this background, this article is structured as follows. In the next section, I explain that the principle of non-intervention is clearly applicable in cyberspace. I underline, in particular, that its application to cyberthreats is less controversial than other rules, namely sovereignty or the prohibition to use force—whose implementation in a 'digital' space instead of a 'physical' space remains disputed (Section 2). In the third section, I analyse what is domaine réservé and the reason why this concept is no longer adequate to address cyber activities. In particular, I raise doubts about the current integration of political processes and economic orientations within the domaine réservé, and I contend that it fails to protect those private actors that are vital to the social and cultural system of a state (such as press bodies). I then explain why the notion of domaine réservé should be replaced by the notion of domaine privilégié, what it means and how it would apply to cyberspace (Section 3). In the fourth section, I dwell on the concept of coercion and explain what it means. I underline that the traditional understanding of coercion fails to grasp situations where the state is deprived of its control, and I support a balanced reinterpretation of this concept (Section 4). Some conclusions are offered in the last section (Section 5).\n## 2.

It thus offers a well-established and valuable source of regulation in the digital sphere. Then, and contrary to sovereignty and the use of force, the application of non-intervention does not raise the thorny issue of the 'territoriality' of cyberspace. The difficulties in applying these concepts partly reside in the fact that they were conceived to apply in a physical space, in order to prevent trespass onto one's territory or the use of weapons by a state against the territory or the troops of another state. Yet, there is 'deep uncertainty about the treatment of cyberspace as just another physical space, like land, air, or sea - over which States may exercise sovereignty or control'.

It is thus possible to grasp breaches of territorial and political integrity equally. Therefore, a state-sponsored activity can breach the principle of non-intervention, even in the absence of ground, air or naval operations on foreign territory. It is significant, in that sense, that the ICJ underlined that ‘[b]etween independent States, respect for territorial sovereignty is an essential foundation of international relations … and international law requires political integrity\n Nicaragua (n 1) para 205.\n It may be noted that some authors resort to a subtle distinction between ‘non-interference’ and ‘non-intervention’. For instance, Niki Aloupi supports a ‘distinction between non-intervention (territorial integrity) and non-interference (independence and autonomy)’, which is ‘theoretically clear’. See: N Aloupi, ‘The Right to Non-intervention and Non-interference’ (2015) 4(3) Cambridge Journal of International and Comparative Law 566, 572. According to Karine Bannelier and Théodore Christakis, non-intervention ‘refers to the protection of the territory of the State, of its dominium, and that its violation would therefore involve the carrying out of material operations in foreign territory’. In contrast, non-interference ‘would refer to interference, without the authorization of the State, in the sphere of the exercise of its national sovereign powers and would, therefore, affect the imperium of the State’. See: K Bannelier and T Christakis, Cyber-Attacks, Prevention-Reactions: The Role of States and Private Actors (Les Cahiers de la Revue Défense Nationale 2017) 43. See also: P-M Dupuy and Y Kerbrat, Droit International Public (Dalloz 2014), paras 117–19. Yet, and as noted by Michael Wood, ‘in most contexts, the two terms seem to be used interchangeably’. See: M Wood, ‘Non-intervention (Non-interference in Domestic Affairs)’ (Encyclopedia Princetoniensis) <https: 551=\"\" pesd.princeton.edu=\"\" node=\"\"> accessed 15 July 2020. According to some authors, the difference between an interference and an intervention lies elsewhere, in the fact that the sole intervention is coercive and consequently, unlawful. See: R Jennings and A Watts, Oppenheim’s International Law-Vol I: Peace (9th edn, OUP 2008) 432; C Henderson, The Use of Force and International Law (CUP 2018) 51; M Schmitt (ed), Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations (CUP 2017) 313. It may be noted that declarations and case law are of little help to cut a clear distinction between ‘non-intervention’ and ‘non-interference’. The blurring probably culminated in Declaration 2625, which is supposed to contain ‘principles of international law’. It indeed mentioned that ‘[n]o State or group of States has the right to intervene, directly or indirectly, for any reason whatever, in the internal or external affairs of any other State. Consequently, armed intervention and all other forms of interference or attempted threats against the personality of the State or against its political, economic and cultural elements, are in violation of international law.’ See: UNGA Res 2625. In 1986, the ICJ found that ‘[t]he principle of non-intervention involves the right of every sovereign State to conduct its affairs without outside interference’. See: Nicaragua (n 1) para 202. In 2005, the ICJ ruled that ‘Uganda had violated the sovereignty and also the territorial integrity of the DRC. Uganda’s actions equally constituted an interference in the internal affairs of the DRC … The unlawful military intervention by Uganda was of such a magnitude and duration that the Court consider[ed] it to be a grave violation’ of UN Charter’s art 2(4).

For the sake of clarity, I will use the term 'meddling' to describe 'the act of trying to change or have an influence on things that are not your responsibility', without a legal connotation. In contrast, I will use the term 'intervention' to describe those coercive—and unlawful—activities directed against the internal or external affairs of other states.\n# 3. A reconceptualisation of the domaine réservé\nIn this section, I will first explain the concept of domaine réservé, and why this old-fashioned concept is unsatisfactory in the digital era (Subsection 3A). To alleviate this problem, I argue in favour of a reconceptualisation of the concept into a domaine privilégié (Subsection 3B).\n# A. The concept of domaine réservé\nThe exact wording used by the ICJ in the Nicaragua case to address the first component of a prohibited intervention was the following:\n... the principle forbids all States or groups of States to intervene directly or indirectly in internal or external affairs of other States. A prohibited intervention must accordingly be one bearing on matters in which each State is permitted, by the principle of State sovereignty, to decide freely. One of these is the choice of a political, economic, social and cultural system, and the formulation of foreign policy.[19]\nThis condition is often reconciled with the notion of state domaine réservé, which 'describes areas where States are free from international obligations and regulation'.[20]\nThe challenge with the domaine réservé resides in its shifting contours. In fact, the Permanent Court of International Justice (PCIJ) underlined that '[t]he question whether a certain matter is or is not solely within the jurisdiction of a State [ie if it is part of the domaine réservé] is an essentially relative question; it depends on the development of international relations'.[21] However, few domains are now totally\n\nReviving the Principle of Non-Intervention in Cyberspace 431\nisolated from international law. For instance, states are increasingly constrained in their ability to make free economic decisions. Free-trade agreements—the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), European Economic Area (EEA), North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) and Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), to name just a few—have prospered, and judicial mechanisms have even been created to enforce some of them. Thus, in the current state of international law, most economic questions pulled out of the domaine réservé. But that's not all. States entered into international agreements in the area of electoral process too. From a certain perspective, one might conclude that it is not within the domaine réservé anymore. After all, the ICJ made clear that '[a] State, which is free to decide upon the principle and methods of popular consultation within its domestic order, is sovereign for the purpose of accepting a limitation of its sovereignty in this field'.\n P Kunig, ‘Intervention, Prohibition of’ in R Wolfrum et al (eds), Max Planck Encyclopaedia of Public International Law (OUP, online edition, 2008) para 3; J Verhoeven, ‘Non-intervention: \"Affaires intérieures\" ou \"Vie privée\"?’ in Le droit international au service de la paix, de la justice et du développement: mélanges Michel Virally (Pedone 1991) 497; Ziegler (n 20) para 3.\n See: D Hollis, ‘The Influence of War; the War for Influence’ (2018) 32 Temple International &amp; Comparative Law Journal 31, 40; I Navarette, ‘L’Espionnage en Temps de Paix en Droit International Public’ (2015) 53 Canadian Yearbook of International Law 1, 30.\n General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Adopted on 30 October 1947, entered into force on 1 January 1948) 55 UNTS 194.\n General Agreement on Trade in Services (1869 UNTS 183) Annex 1B of the Marrakech Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization (Adopted on 15 April 1994, entered into force on 1 January 1995).\n European Economic Area Agreement (Adopted on 2 May 1992, entered into force on 1 January 1994).\n North American Free Trade Agreement (Adopted on 17 December 1992, entered into force on 1 January 1994) 32 ILM 289.\n ASEAN Free Trade Area Agreement (Adopted on 28 January 1992, entered into force 1 January 2003).\n Treaty Establishing the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (Adopted on 5 November 1993, entered into force on 8 December 1994) 33 ILM 1067.\n For instance, the European Court of Justice (ECJ), the WTO Appellate Body and the COMESA Court of Justice.\n For instance, electoral rights of citizens are protected under art 25 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). See: ICCPR (adopted 16 December 1966, entered into force 23 March 1976) 999 UNTS 171, art 25; ‘General Comment No. 25: The Right to Participate in Public Affairs, Voting Rights and the Right of Equal Access to Public Service’ (art 25) (1996) CCPR/C/21/Rev.1/Add.7.\n Nicaragua (n 1) para 259. The ICJ previously mentioned: '[h]owever, the assertion of a commitment raises the question of the possibility of a State binding itself by agreement in relation to a question of domestic policy, such as that relating to the holding of free elections on its territory. The Court cannot discover, within the range of subjects open to international agreement, any obstacle or provision to hinder a State from making a commitment of this kind.'\nThibault Moulin\nObviously, this is extremely problematic. Let us imagine, for instance, that the Russians did not carry out a hack-and-leak operation against the DNC, but blackmailed the US President into resigning or directly tampered with the election results. Alternatively, let us imagine that ‘State A’ and ‘State B’ are both competing to sell jet-fighters to ‘State C’. State A decides to infect the electronic systems of the jet-fighters manufactured by State B, in order to cause failures, damage their reputation, end their production and —at the end of the day—win the bid and eliminate a competitor. If these areas are not within the domaine réservé anymore, then even those extreme forms of meddling in the political or economic affairs of another state would not qualify as prohibited interventions.\nAnother problem with the concept of domaine réservé is that it fails to regulate those cyber operations exclusively directed against private actors, even if they are vital to the social[33] and cultural system of a state.[34] For instance, the cyberattacks against Sony Pictures Entertainment (SPE) in 2014 revealed the attempts of foreign governments to meddle with values that are essential to liberal democracies, such as freedom of expression. As a matter of fact, 'the real motive of the operation appears to have been an attempt to prevent the film's global distribution as well as an attempt to deter SPE and other studios from insulting the North Korean regime'.[35] It must be said that this attempt was partially successful, as SPE had to cancel the film's release.[36] This decision was criticised by President Obama himself, who declared:\n[w]e cannot have a society where some dictator someplace can start imposing censorship here in the United States ... Imagine if producers and distributors and others start engaging in self-censorship because they don't want to offend the sensibilities of someone who's sensibilities probably need to be offended.[37]\nYet, and by virtue of the lex lata, the fact that such attacks were exclusively targeting a private company excludes the possibility to describe them in terms of prohibited interventions.[38] And indeed, the US government opted for an\n\nReviving the Principle of Non-Intervention in Cyberspace 433\nalternative term: ‘an act of cyber-vandalism’. Let us imagine that the goal of North Korea was to prompt the adoption of a new law in the USA, which would increase movie censorship. Alternatively, let us imagine that the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) launches a series of attacks against the movie industry in France, to protest the upcoming release of a similar comedy depicting the North Korean regime. They paralyse the movie industry, and studios experience significant economic losses. The goal is to put such pressure on the Minister of Culture that he is forced to refuse to grant the movie a ‘visa d’exploitation’ (ie the authorisation to broadcast a film). If one admits that restrictions to the freedom of expression are still part of the domaine réservé—which is arguably not the case, as human rights conventions usually regulate this area—these attacks are more likely to qualify as interventions because the private actor was only targeted to obtain something from the state. In fact, attacks against the movie industry or newspapers are on the rise, and the resort to ‘criminal hackers’ might just ‘provide a cheap and easy way of censoring the press’. To alleviate this risk, I suggest replacement of the old-fashioned concept of domaine réservé with the newer domaine privilégié.\n## B. The concept of domaine privilégié\nThe objections raised against the concept of domaine réservé are the following: it has been stripped of most of its content and it is maladjusted to the new contribution of non-state actors to the exercise of fundamental freedoms. Consequently, a domaine réservé—based principle of non-interventions fails to protect the free choice and the stability of a political, economic, social or cultural system from foreign attacks. This is where the domaine privilégié comes in, as it appears necessary to opt for a concept with clear-cut contours, which remains unaffected by the development of international law, and protects the fundamental interests of a state and its population.

The protected interests typically include state security and public safety—ie against terrorism, espionage, murder of government officials, hostage-taking—as well as economic and social stability—ie against counterfeiting of currency and various offences, such as 'falsification of official documents, perjury before consular officials, and conspiracy to violate immigration or customs laws'. It is worth noting, thus, that 'the protective principle can be invoked with respect to a far broader range of acts than the rights to self-defence'.\nIn addition, Article 25 of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (DARS) acknowledges the existence of a ground for precluding wrongfulness called 'necessity'. Necessity may be invoked when an otherwise illegal measure 'is the only way for the State to safeguard an essential interest against a grave and imminent peril'. Yet, the International Law Commission (ILC) made clear that 'essential interests' were not restricted to cases where the 'existence' of the state was in danger, highlighting that necessity had also been invoked to prevent 'the extermination of a fur seal\nare not entitled to dispose of freely in the exercise of their sovereignty.'

The early roots of this doctrine can be found in Hobbes’s writings, and it was theorised by authors such as Wolff and Vattel. Wolff considered that nations had a ‘duty of self-preservation’. Hence, ‘every nation ha[d] the right to those means by which it can, as far as possible, avert the peril of destruction and avoid those things which can bring destruction upon it’. Vattel defined certain ‘inalienable rights’ of nations, those required by ‘necessity’ or for its ‘preservation’—and their satisfaction usually justified the use of force. Years later, Gidel thought that states had ‘fundamental’ or ‘inherent’ rights, which were ‘absolute, inviolable and unalienable’, and included ‘preservation, independence, equality, respect, international trade’. Self-preservation actually gained a negative reputation, as it was often ‘the criterion used to justify the rights of states to have recourse to arms’ and ‘for the violation of the rights of other subjects’. Yet, literature of the post-war era reveals an alternative reading of self-preservation, which is more respectful of the rights of other states. For instance, Alfaro highlighted that ‘[s]elf-preservation rests upon the reciprocal\nsupplies of petroleum products, with the resultant dangers for the country’s existence, could therefore seriously affect the public security …’: Campus Oil Limited and others v Minister for Industry and Energy and others (Judgment) [1984] ECR 1984-02727, para 34; E Brosset, ‘Le protectionnisme et le motif de protection de la santé en droit de l’Union européenne’ (Hal, 2014) <https: 942752=\"\" docid=\"\" file=\"\" file/index=\"\" file@unione.europei_enne2.pdf=\"\" docid/942752=\"\" filename=\"\" hal.archives-ouvertes.fr=\"\"> accessed 5 May 2020.\n T Hobbes, Leviathan (1651), pt II, ch XVIII, para 6.

Hence, a nation had allegedly ‘the right of procuring provisions by force’, when a neighbour refused to sell its oversupply, ‘the right of innocent use’ of ‘inexhaustible’ resources, such as water and the sea, as well as the right to ‘force a passage when it [was] unjustly refused’, provided that there was ‘a real necessity [that] oblige[d] you to enter into the territory of others’. It then had the right to make use, ‘either by free consent or by force’, of ‘the ships, waggons, horses, or even the personal labour of foreigners’, and provided that it a ‘pressing want’ and pay ‘a compensation’ for them. Vattel also underlined this ‘right’ for ‘a nation of men’, to ‘procure women, who are absolutely necessary to its preservation’, and to use force if needed, and the right of foreigners to ‘mak[e] a settlement in the first country where they find land enough for themselves, without depriving the inhabitants of what is sufficient for them’.

Yet, in contrast with necessity or the early doctrine of self-preservation, it does not provide justification for breaching the rights of other states, but results in a duty of abstention: states must refrain from meddling with the domaine privilégié of other states. This domaine privilégié includes not only the elements necessary for the very survival of a state but also those that are essential for its independence, autonomy and stability.\nFirst, it protects the political organisation of the state, including the forms of government, the rule of law, personal, collective and political freedoms, as well as the electoral process in full (primary, local and general elections, referenda, etc). Under this new framework, the hack-and-leak operation that targeted the DNC would meddle with the American electoral process and, therefore, with the US domaine privilégié. It would also be affected in the event of cyber operations directed at the movie industry or press organs—like the SPE scenarios—as they seek to restrict the exercise of fundamental freedoms.\nSecondly, it encompasses internal and external security. For instance, the 2015 data breach at the US Office of Personnel Management (OPM) compromised the security of the USA, as it could 'reveal the identities of CIA [Central Intelligence Agency] operatives serving under diplomatic cover'.69 In this case, the domaine privilégié of the USA was obviously affected.\nThirdly, it incorporates major economic interests, ie 'interests so essential that a breach of them threatens the economic ... stability' of the state.70 Key and energy industries, major employers, transports, banking transactions and telecommunications may qualify as such. For instance, and considering that the petrochemical sector 'is a core part of the Saudi economy',71 the cyberattacks against oil companies in Saudi Arabia may affect its domaine privilégié. The same would be true for the 2017 NotPetya attacks, which were aimed at disrupting Ukraine's financial system.72 Insofar as they may provoke the downfall\n\nThibault Moulin\nof the aviation industry in 'State B', the cyberattacks induced by 'State A' in the fictitious example above would also impair the former's domaine privilégié.\nFourthly, it embraces public services, including health and social systems. Hence, state-sponsored attacks against hospitals would obviously affect the domaine privilégié. For instance, in March 2020, the Brno University Hospital had to turn away patients 'suffering serious conditions', and 'urgent surgeries' were postponed following a cyberattack, which shutdown all computers.73 In such situations, the impact on the domaine privilégié is obvious.\nFifthly, the domaine privilégié may extend to the preservation of a state's environment. For example, the 2017 NotPetya attacks also broke the monitoring systems of the nuclear power plant in Chernobyl, and they could have led to long-lasting damage to Ukraine's environment.74\nForeign meddling with this domaine privilégié would be prohibited, unless adopted within the legal framework of countermeasures.75 If the proposed concept of domaine privilégié is clearly de lege ferenda,76 it results from state practice that some governments might actually be sympathetic, for example, to the protection of main economic interests through the principle of non-intervention.77\nworld/national-security/russian-military-was-behind-notpetya-cyberattack-in-ukraine-cia-concludes/2018/01/12/048d8506-f7ca-11e7-b34a-b85626af34ef_story.html&gt; accessed 9 May 2020.\n\nReviving the Principle of Non-Intervention in Cyberspace 439\n# 4. A reconceptualisation of coercion\nIn this section, I will first explain the traditional definition of the concept of coercion, and why it is unsatisfactory in the digital era (Subsection 4A). I then put forward my own reappraisal of the concept of coercion (Subsection 4B).\n## A. The traditional definition of coercion\nCoercion must be equated with the implementation of ‘coercive measures’ or ‘coercive methods’ and must be distinguished from the mere influence or persuasion. In fact, Vattel described interference as an ‘attempt to put a constraint on [the] deliberations’ of another state, whereas Kant put down that ‘[n]o State shall by force interfere with the constitution or government of another State’. The Montevideo Convention on the Rights and Duties of States of 1933 established a duty of non-recognition of situations ‘obtained by force whether this consist[ed] in the employment of arms, in threatening diplomatic representations, or in any other effective coercive measures’. The Charter of the Organization of American States (OAS) prevented states from ‘us[ing] or encouraging[ing] the use of coercive measures of an economic or political character in order to force the sovereign will of another state and obtain from it advantages of any kind’. It also underlined that ‘[n]o territorial acquisitions or special advantages obtained either by force or by other means of coercion shall be recognized’. In the Nicaragua case, the ICJ used the term ‘methods of coercion’. Another question that arises is whether intention is necessary. An analysis of the ICJ case law confirms that intention must be taken into account.\nAssemblée Nationale (France), ‘Première Séance Du Lundi 13 Avril 2015’ (13 April 2015) <www.assemblee-nationale.fr 14=\"\" 14-cri=\"\" 2014-2015=\"\" 20150212.asp#p511027=\"\"> accessed 13 February 2020.

As the Court noted in the Nicaragua case:\n... in international law, if one State, with a view to the coercion of another State, supports and assists armed bands in that State whose purpose is to overthrow the government of that State, that amounts to an intervention by the one State in the internal affairs of the other, whether or not the political objective of the State giving such support and assistance is equally far-reaching.\nIn fact, the Court did not find it necessary ‘to seek to establish whether the intention of the United States to secure a change of governmental policies in Nicaragua went so far as to be equated with an endeavour to overthrow the Nicaraguan Government’. This criterion was not challenged by the judgment pertaining to the Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo. It is true that the Court found that non-intervention was violated ‘even if the objectives of Uganda were not to overthrow President Kabila’, and were intended ‘to securing towns and airports for reason of its perceived security needs, and in support of the parallel activity of those engaged in civil war’. Yet, this position may be explained by the fact that a prohibited use of force was also found. In its traditional sense, coercion thus occurs when a state deploys those means of pressure against another state, which are of a sufficiently serious nature to, and with the intention to, compel the latter to act in a certain way—or to refrain from acting in a certain way—and against its own will. Coercion is not a result-\nS Watts, ‘Low-intensity Cyber Operations and the Principle of Non-intervention’ in JD Ohlin, K Govern and C Finkelstein (eds), *Cyber War: Law and Ethics for Virtual Conflicts* (OUP 2015) 268.\n Nicaragua (n 1) para 241. ‘With a view to the coercion’ was translated in the French version into ‘exercer une pression’ (ie ‘put pressure’).\n ibid. Yet, it was ‘clearly established’ that ‘the United States intended, by its support of the contras, to coerce the Government of Nicaragua’, and ‘that the intention of the contras themselves was to overthrow the present Government of Nicaragua’.\n Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo (n 16).\n ibid, para 163.\n ibid, paras 164 and 165.\n ‘Coercion in inter-State relations involves the government of one State compelling the government of another State to think or act in a certain way by applying various kinds of pressure, threats, intimidation or the use of force’: C Joyner, ‘Coercion’ in R Wolfrum et al (eds), *Max Planck Encyclopaedia of Public International Law* (OUP, online edition, 2006) para 1. ‘Coercion’ is defined by the Black’s Law Dictionary as the ‘compulsion of a free agent by physical, moral, or economic force or threat of physical force’: definition of ‘coercion’, *Black’s Law Dictionary* (10th edn, 2014). The French translation—‘contrainte’—confirms this meaning and may be defined as follows: ‘[a]ction de contraindre, de forcer quelqu’un à agir contre sa volonté; pression morale ou physique, violence exercée sur lui.’ See: Definition of ‘contrainte’ (*Larousse*) &lt;www.larousse.fr/dictionnaires/francais/contrainte/18670#pWqM8QLtC0uMc51R.99&gt; accessed 26 March 2020. See also: P Daillier, M Forteau and A\nReviving the Principle of Non-Intervention in Cyberspace 441\nbased approach, and whether the use of coercive measures was successful or not is of no significance. For instance, the ICJ concluded in the Nicaragua case that the principle of non-intervention was breached by the USA even if the attempt at securing political change failed.\nThis understanding of coercion sets a high threshold and most cyber operations do not pass this test. If a state was demanding another one to declare the wrong candidate a winner of the elections, or to declare the favourite candidate ineligible on false grounds, under the threat of launching a debilitating wave of cyberattacks, then the criterion of coercion would be met. Yet, it constitutes a textbook case which will rarely (if ever) happen in practice. In practice, democracy, freedom of expression or the proper functioning of infrastructures (among others) are hindered without a need for ‘compelling’ a state through the deployment of ‘coercive methods’. If Russia’s objective was to help Trump in the case of the DNC, voters or the government were not ‘coerced’ stricto sensu. The former were given stolen information and fake news to persuade them to vote for Donald Trump—or ‘not vote at all’. Then, state-sponsored attacks often take the form of ‘cyber-vandalism’ and would not pass the coercion test either. Let us take two actual examples of attacks against press organs. In April 2015, the French television network TV5Monde was the victim of a cyberattack directed by the so-called ‘CyberCaliphate’, who claimed to belong to the Islamic State. The distribution of programmes was interrupted for hours. Two months later, investigations revealed that the attack was more likely sponsored by Moscow and may constitute nothing more than an act of retaliation in reaction to the French and European measures adopted against\nPellet, Droit International Public (LGDJ 2009) 1025–26; Government (the Netherlands) (n 11).\n Nicaragua (n 1) para 292(3).\n The USA, through the voice of Brian Egan, acknowledged that non-intervention was ‘generally viewed as a relatively narrow rule of customary international law …’.

In a nutshell, it was probably an act of revenge, which did not seek to coerce TV5Monde into doing (or not doing) something. A more recent case is the December 2018 interruption of the distribution of several American newspapers—including The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal—by a cyberattack. The malware used had similarities with Ryuk, which is a ransomware used by North Koreans. Yet, money may not have been the real motive of the attack as, according to some commentators, ‘the intention of the attack was to disable infrastructure, more specifically servers, as opposed to looking to steal information’. It is thus likely that the operation was merely intended to affect the proper functioning of those press organs, rather than obtain any financial benefit. If the motivations behind NotPetya were not entirely made clear, the attacks against the Saudi petrochemical sector were most likely an act of retaliation by Iran.

This may appear, from a certain perspective, as highly unsatisfactory, and it reveals that the concept of ‘coercion’ is in need of a reappraisal, to fit the new peculiarities of cyberattacks.\n## B. The reappraisal of coercion\nAs mentioned above, ‘coercion’ historically occurs ‘when a State deploys those means of pressure against another State, that are of a sufficiently serious nature to, and with the intention to, compel the latter to act in a certain way – or to refrain from acting in a certain way – and against its own will’. Yet, this definition is unsatisfactory in the cyber realm and fails to grasp new types of highly disruptive cyberattacks. Any reappraisal of the coercion is a risky exercise, though, and we must beware of excessively watering down this concept, at the risk of hindering basic interstate relations.\nIn particular, the distinction between plain ‘influence’ and constraint must be maintained. It is likely that states will use the information they obtained through cyberespionage operations to influence the negotiation strategies and decision-making of other states, in line with their own interests. It is also likely that states that suffered cyberattacks or acts of cyberespionage will adapt their internal and external policies, either for the purpose of repairing the damage or for preventing further strikes.

Yet, if we equate ‘coercion’ with ‘attempts at influence’ or with ‘prompting a reaction from another State’, any negotiation process or process that puts a foreign state in a situation where a change of position is required would qualify as prohibited interventions. Since influence seems to be a normal course of international relations, there is a risk that most interstate interactions would be unlawful. This is true both of the digital and physical domains. As once underlined by Switzerland, there is—and I think there must be—a ‘limit between the lawful influence and the unlawful constraint’.\nIt was previously argued that two elements must usually be taken into consideration to make sure that coercion occurred: (i) the resort to means of a sufficiently serious nature; and (ii) the intention of the author. In cyberspace, however, it is usually an analysis of the method used (a malware) that helps cybersecurity experts to determine the prima facie intention of the author.

State A makes a $85 million offer, whereas State B makes a $83 million offer. State A finally wins the contract, after making another offer: $82 million. State A was indeed obliged—due to the lower price proposed by State B—to change its position. Then, let us imagine that the companies based in ‘State D’ manufacture cars and sell them in large quantities abroad. A few years later, companies in ‘State E’ start manufacturing cars to a lower price, and the car industry collapses in State D, prompting the latter in renewing its economic or tax policies. State D indeed had—due to the economic emergence of State E—to review its policies. Let us take a third and last example. State F is a developing country that depends on foreign aid to fund the police. Following a wave of protest, the police in State F fires teargas and rubber bullets on demonstrators. State G—which is a donor—is shocked and decides to halt some aid. To remedy this situation, State F decides to cut education funding. In fact, State G prompted State F into changing its policies. If we equate ‘coercion’ with ‘influence’, these classical situations might result in prohibited interventions—and generate countermeasures in return.

They deprive actors of control and render them powerless instead. With election meddling, citizens are deprived of the possibility of expressing themselves democratically. For instance, the goal of the hack-and-leak operation that targeted the DNC was to reshape the public opinion and ‘represent[ed] the most recent expression of Moscow’s longstanding desire to undermine the US-led liberal democratic order’. Attacks directed at the media industry deprive organs of the possibility to express themselves and deprive citizens of the right to information. NotPetya attacks deprived Ukraine of the possibility to control financial transactions and the radioactivity level at the Chernobyl plant. It is thus necessary, for a reappraisal of coercion, to take those particularities into account. In a digital context, coercion may then be conceptualised as ‘a deprivation of control (1), resulting from the deliberate action of another State, as evidenced prima facie by the characteristics of the malware used (2)’. In my opinion, neither the ability of the targeted actor to prevent the attacks nor its\n Some definitions move in that direction. For instance, the Australian government suggests: ‘[a] prohibited intervention is one that interferes by coercive means (in the sense that they effectively deprive another state of the ability to control, decide upon or govern matters of an inherently sovereign nature) …’. See: Government (Australia) (n 11). I first read it in Harriet Moynihan’s paper, where this definition is discussed: H Moynihan, ‘The Application of International Law to State Cyberattacks’ (Chatham House, 2019) 40–43 <www.chathamhouse.org default=\"\" files=\"\" files/publications=\"\" research=\"\" sites=\"\" research/2019-11-29-intl-law-cyberattacks.pdf=\"\"> accessed 6 February 2020. Robert Jennings and Arthur Watts also suggested: ‘to constitute intervention, the interference must be forcible or dictatorial, or otherwise coercive, in effect depriving the state intervened against of control over the matter in question’. See: Jennings and Watts (n 16) 432.\n Tampering with the electoral results has been described as prohibited interventions by some states, including Australia, Switzerland, the UK and the USA. See: Caflisch (n 11) 105; Attorney General’s Office and Jeremy Wright (UK) (n 8); Egan, ‘Remarks on International Law and Stability in Cyberspace’ (n 11); Government (Australia) (n 11). Describing ballot stuffing in terms of prohibited intervention is however not a new idea. In the 1980s, the US Congress highlighted that ‘[u]nilateral intervention in the internal affairs of other nations is antithetical to democracy. It contravenes international treaties and norms that are vital to the long-term peace and security of all nations in the Hemisphere. Intervention violates the right of self-determination which is the underpinning of every democracy.’ See: United States Congress House Committee on Appropriations Subcommittee on Foreign Operations and Related Agencies Appropriations, Foreign Assistance and Related Programs Appropriations for 1985: Hearings Before a Subcommittee of the Committee on Appropriations, House of Representatives, Ninety-Eighth Congress, Second Session (US Government Printing Office 1984) 662. Experts now suggest that doxfare might be at odd with self-determination, but clearly disagree as to whether it also constitutes a prohibited intervention.

It means that a prohibited intervention occurs as soon as these two conditions are met, even if the victim failed to equip itself with state-of-the-art protections, or reacted too late—for instance, due to technical or bureaucratic reasons. In the case of NotPetya, hackers exploited the vulnerabilities of older versions of Windows, for which corrective patches were nonetheless available. In the case of the OPM, 'persistent deficiencies' in the IT security programme had been reported before the data breach and were probably not fixed when it happened. Yet, these deficiencies do not alter the seriousness of the attacks: a deliberate deprivation of control still occurs.\nIt is finally appropriate to touch on the issue of economic cyberespionage. Under the framework put forward in this article, it is clear that only the most severe forms of intellectual property theft (if there are any) would qualify as prohibited interventions—those prone to threatening the economic stability of a state. If this phenomenon is indeed problematic and calls—in my opinion—for legal answers, tailor-made rules are required. In that sense, the Paris Call is interesting, as signatories pledged to '[p]revent ICT-enabled theft of intellectual property, including trade secrets or other confidential business information, with the intent of providing competitive advantages to companies or commercial sector'.\n# 5. Conclusion\nIn this article, I championed the applicability of non-intervention in cyberspace. In my view, such applicability is welcomed by the international community and does not raise theoretical questions about the nature of sovereignty or the militarisation of cyberspace. However, I expressed fears that this principle becomes obsolete if we keep equating 'matters in which each State is permitted, by the principle of State sovereignty, to decide freely' with the notion of domaine réservé. I thus recommended that, for the purpose of non-intervention, we ought to adopt the notion of state domaine privilégié. The latter encompasses the political organisation of a state, its internal and external security, major economic interests and public services (including the health and social systems), as well as the preservation of a state's environment. Then, I turned to the concept of coercion, arguing in favour of a 'balanced' reinterpretation of coercion—ie a\n 'What Is Petya and NotPetya Ransomware' (McAfee) <www.mcafee.com enterprise=\"\" fr-fr=\"\" security-awareness=\"\" ransomware=\"\" petya.html=\"\"> accessed 12 May 2020.\n OPM (the USA), 'Semi-Annual Report to Congress' (2015) <www.opm.gov for=\"\" reports-publications=\"\" semi-annual-reports=\"\" sar52.pdf=\"\" www.opm.gov=\"\"> accessed 12 May 2020; D Auerbach, 'The OPM Breach Is a Catastrophe' Slate (16 June 2015) <https: 06=\"\" 2015=\"\" slate.com=\"\" opm-hack-its-a-catastrophe-heres-how-the-government-can-stop-the-next-one.html=\"\" technology=\"\"> accessed 12 May 2020.\n 'Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace' (n 8).\n Nicaragua (n 1) para 205.</https:></www.opm.gov></www.opm.gov>\nReviving the Principle of Non-Intervention in Cyberspace 447\nreconceptualisation that takes into account situations where states or non-state actors are deprived of control, but does not go as far as equating coercion with influence. This would indeed totally hinder international relations. In the end, it may be argued that a prohibited intervention occurs whenever a state (or a non-state actor located in that state) is deprived of control over matters within the domaine privilégié, due to the deliberate action of another state (as evidenced prima facie by the characteristics of the malware used). Yet, any cyber activity emanating from a state that prompts a given reaction in another state should not automatically be viewed as a prohibited intervention. After all—and as well illustrated by Denmark—‘[a]s hacker groups continuously perfect their technical skills and capabilities, state institutions will be forced to heighten their security levels and are thus engaged in a constant cyber-race.’\n Centre for Cybersecurity (Denmark), ‘The Cyber Threat Against Denmark’ (2016) 4 <https: cfcs=\"\" cfcsdocuments=\"\" cfcsdocuments=\"\" threat%20assessment%20-%20the%20cyber%20threat%20against%20denmark.pdf=\"\" fe-ddis.dk=\"\"> accessed 29 February 2020.</https:>\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jcsl/article/25/3/423/5879500 by Eastman Dental Institute user on 03 July 2025"

In contrast, the relevance of the non-intervention principle is accepted by states and raises less questions about the ‘territoriality’ or the ‘militarization’ of cyberspace. At first sight, it thus appears as a convenient source for the regulation of cyberthreats. However, the *Nicaragua* case also established a stringent test for a foreign interference to qualify as an unlawful intervention. First, it must bear ‘on matters in which each State is permitted, by the principle of State sovereignty to decide freely’ (ie the ‘domaine réservé’). Then, it must involve ‘methods of coercion in regard to such choices’. I contend that both criteria are maladjusted to address cyberthreats and must be reconceptualised. In fact, the *domaine réservé* describes domains where states are free from international rules. However, few domains, including electoral processes or main economic orientations, are totally isolated from international law. I thus argue that it must be reconceptualised into the so-called ‘domaine privilégié’. It consists of a domain with clear-cut contours, unaffected by the developments of international law, which encompasses the fundamental interests of a state and its population. Then, coercion describes situations where a state is compelled to act, or to refrain from acting, in a certain fashion.

In fact, he considered that '[t]o ignore this doctrine is to undermine international order and to promote violence and bloodshed which may prove catastrophic in the end'. More than three decades later, international lawyers' attempts at regulating emerging technologies reveal that the 'principle' of non-intervention might be relevant in situations where there is no risk of 'bloodshed', in a world that lacks flesh and bones: cyberspace. In particular, there has been a renewed interest in this principle since the hack-and-leak operation that targeted the Democratic National Committee (DNC) in 2016 and the alleged interference of Russia in the US elections. If some commentators suggested that Moscow had 'cross[ed] a line', most experts nevertheless came to the conclusion that the so-called 'hack-and-leak' operations were not coercive, and did not constitute a prohibited intervention. The discomfort of the US government with describing this operation as a prohibited intervention was also clear.\nAs a matter of fact,\n1 Separate Opinion of President Nagendra Singh in Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v USA) (Judgment)  ICJ Rep 14, 156.\n2 ibid.

First, ‘[a] prohibited intervention must … be one bearing on matters in which each State is permitted, by the principle of State sovereignty, to decide freely’.⁶ This concept is also known as the ‘domaine réservé’ (reserved domain) of the state. Secondly, a prohibited intervention must use ‘methods of coercion in regard to such choices, which must remain free ones’.⁷ It appears that under this stringent test, most cyber operations and attempts at influence will never qualify as prohibited interventions. According to most experts and as suggested above, the main reason is that ‘methods of coercion’ are lacking. I nevertheless argue that this is only part of the problem: in fact, both features are maladjusted to address the characteristics of cyberthreats. My main point, then, is that they must be reconceptualised, and that a new definition of non-intervention in the cyberspace context must be achieved. If we fail to do so, the principle of non-intervention will fall into disuse with regard to cyberthreats. I thus demonstrate that the old-fashioned concept of domaine réservé must be reconceptualised into what I call the ‘domaine privilégié’\nResponse to Russian Malicious Cyber Activity and Harassment’ (29 December 2016) <https: 12=\"\" 2016=\"\" 29=\"\" document-president-actions-response-russian-malicious-cyber-activity=\"\" the-press-office=\"\" obamawhitehouse.archives.gov=\"\"> accessed 3 October 2019.

France was perhaps the sole exception, as French Minister of Foreign Affairs Ayrault declared at the Parliament that any foreign interference in the presidential campaign of 2017 would constitute ‘a breach of the principle of non-intervention’ that could justify ‘retaliatory measures’. He added: ‘no foreign power is allowed to influence Frenchmen’s choice; no foreign power is allowed to choose the next President of the Republic’.

I also argue in favour of a balanced reinterpretation of the concept of coercion, in order to encompass serious forms of foreign meddling, which deprive actors of control and render them powerless. In the end, the proposed definition is that a prohibited intervention occurs whenever a state (or a non-state actor located in that state) is deprived of control over matters within the domaine privilégié, due to the deliberate action of another state (as evidenced prima facie by the characteristics of the malware used).\nAgainst this background, this article is structured as follows. In the next section, I explain that the principle of non-intervention is clearly applicable in cyberspace. I underline, in particular, that its application to cyberthreats is less controversial than other rules, namely sovereignty or the prohibition to use force—whose implementation in a 'digital' space instead of a 'physical' space remains disputed (Section 2). In the third section, I analyse what is domaine réservé and the reason why this concept is no longer adequate to address cyber activities. In particular, I raise doubts about the current integration of political processes and economic orientations within the domaine réservé, and I contend that it fails to protect those private actors that are vital to the social and cultural system of a state (such as press bodies). I then explain why the notion of domaine réservé should be replaced by the notion of domaine privilégié, what it means and how it would apply to cyberspace (Section 3). In the fourth section, I dwell on the concept of coercion and explain what it means. I underline that the traditional understanding of coercion fails to grasp situations where the state is deprived of its control, and I support a balanced reinterpretation of this concept (Section 4). Some conclusions are offered in the last section (Section 5).\n## 2.

It thus offers a well-established and valuable source of regulation in the digital sphere. Then, and contrary to sovereignty and the use of force, the application of non-intervention does not raise the thorny issue of the 'territoriality' of cyberspace. The difficulties in applying these concepts partly reside in the fact that they were conceived to apply in a physical space,¹³ in order to prevent trespass onto one's territory or the use of weapons by a state against the territory or the troops of another state.

Therefore, a state-sponsored activity can breach the principle of non-intervention, even in the absence of ground, air or naval operations on foreign territory.¹⁶ It is significant, in that sense, that the ICJ underlined that ‘[b]etween independent States, respect for territorial sovereignty is an essential foundation of international relations … and international law requires political integrity\n¹⁵ Nicaragua (n 1) para 205.\n¹⁶ It may be noted that some authors resort to a subtle distinction between ‘non-interference’ and ‘non-intervention’. For instance, Niki Aloupi supports a ‘distinction between non-intervention (territorial integrity) and non-interference (independence and autonomy)’, which is ‘theoretically clear’. See: N Aloupi, ‘The Right to Non-intervention and Non-interference’ (2015) 4(3) Cambridge Journal of International and Comparative Law 566, 572. According to Karine Bannelier and Théodore Christakis, non-intervention ‘refers to the protection of the territory of the State, of its dominium, and that its violation would therefore involve the carrying out of material operations in foreign territory’. In contrast, non-interference ‘would refer to interference, without the authorization of the State, in the sphere of the exercise of its national sovereign powers and would, therefore, affect the imperium of the State’. See: K Bannelier and T Christakis, Cyber-Attacks, Prevention-Reactions: The Role of States and Private Actors (Les Cahiers de la Revue Défense Nationale 2017) 43. See also: P-M Dupuy and Y Kerbrat, Droit International Public (Dalloz 2014), paras 117–19. Yet, and as noted by Michael Wood, ‘in most contexts, the two terms seem to be used interchangeably’. See: M Wood, ‘Non-intervention (Non-interference in Domestic Affairs)’ (Encyclopedia Princetoniensis) <https: 551=\"\" pesd.princeton.edu=\"\" node=\"\"> accessed 15 July 2020. According to some authors, the difference between an interference and an intervention lies elsewhere, in the fact that the sole intervention is coercive and consequently, unlawful. See: R Jennings and A Watts, Oppenheim’s International Law-Vol I: Peace (9th edn, OUP 2008) 432; C Henderson, The Use of Force and International Law (CUP 2018) 51; M Schmitt (ed), Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations (CUP 2017) 313. It may be noted that declarations and case law are of little help to cut a clear distinction between ‘non-intervention’ and ‘non-interference’. The blurring probably culminated in Declaration 2625, which is supposed to contain ‘principles of international law’. It indeed mentioned that ‘[n]o State or group of States has the right to intervene, directly or indirectly, for any reason whatever, in the internal or external affairs of any other State. Consequently, armed intervention and all other forms of interference or attempted threats against the personality of the State or against its political, economic and cultural elements, are in violation of international law.’ See: UNGA Res 2625. In 1986, the ICJ found that ‘[t]he principle of non-intervention involves the right of every sovereign State to conduct its affairs without outside interference’. See: Nicaragua (n 1) para 202. In 2005, the ICJ ruled that ‘Uganda had violated the sovereignty and also the territorial integrity of the DRC. Uganda’s actions equally constituted an interference in the internal affairs of the DRC … The unlawful military intervention by Uganda was of such a magnitude and duration that the Court consider[ed] it to be a grave violation’ of UN Charter’s art 2(4).

For the sake of clarity, I will use the term 'meddling' to describe 'the act of trying to change or have an influence on things that are not your responsibility', without a legal connotation. In contrast, I will use the term 'intervention' to describe those coercive—and unlawful—activities directed against the internal or external affairs of other states.\n# 3. A reconceptualisation of the domaine réservé\nIn this section, I will first explain the concept of domaine réservé, and why this old-fashioned concept is unsatisfactory in the digital era (Subsection 3A). To alleviate this problem, I argue in favour of a reconceptualisation of the concept into a domaine privilégié (Subsection 3B).\n# A. The concept of domaine réservé\nThe exact wording used by the ICJ in the Nicaragua case to address the first component of a prohibited intervention was the following:\n... the principle forbids all States or groups of States to intervene directly or indirectly in internal or external affairs of other States. A prohibited intervention must accordingly be one bearing on matters in which each State is permitted, by the principle of State sovereignty, to decide freely. One of these is the choice of a political, economic, social and cultural system, and the formulation of foreign policy.\nThis condition is often reconciled with the notion of state domaine réservé, which 'describes areas where States are free from international obligations and regulation'.\nThe challenge with the domaine réservé resides in its shifting contours. In fact, the Permanent Court of International Justice (PCIJ) underlined that '[t]he question whether a certain matter is or is not solely within the jurisdiction of a State [ie if it is part of the domaine réservé] is an essentially relative question; it depends on the development of international relations'. However, few domains are now totally\n17 Nicaragua (n 1) para 202.\n18 Definition of 'meddling' (Cambridge Dictionary) <https: anglais=\"\" dictionary.cambridge.org=\"\" media=\"\" fr=\"\" meddling=\"\"> accessed 22 March 2020.\n19 Nicaragua (n 1) para 205.\n20 K Ziegler, 'Domaine Réservé' in Max Planck Encyclopaedia of Public International Law (2013) para 1.\n21 Nationality Decrees Issued in Tunis and Morocco on Nov. 8th, 1921 (Advisory Opinion)  PCIJ Rep Series B No 4, 24.</https:>\nReviving the Principle of Non-Intervention in Cyberspace 431\nisolated from international law.²² For instance, states are increasingly constrained in their ability to make free economic decisions.²³ Free-trade agreements—the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT),²⁴ General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS),²⁵ European Economic Area (EEA),²⁶ North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA),²⁷ ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA)²⁸ and Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA),²⁹ to name just a few—have prospered, and judicial mechanisms have even been created to enforce some of them.³⁰ Thus, in the current state of international law, most economic questions pulled out of the domaine réservé. But that's not all. States entered into international agreements in the area of electoral process too.³¹ From a certain perspective, one might conclude that it is not within the domaine réservé anymore. After all, the ICJ made clear that '[a] State, which is free to decide upon the principle and methods of popular consultation within its domestic order, is sovereign for the purpose of accepting a limitation of its sovereignty in this field'.³²\n²² P Kunig, ‘Intervention, Prohibition of’ in R Wolfrum et al (eds), Max Planck Encyclopaedia of Public International Law (OUP, online edition, 2008) para 3; J Verhoeven, ‘Non-intervention: \"Affaires intérieures\" ou \"Vie privée\"?’ in Le droit international au service de la paix, de la justice et du développement: mélanges Michel Virally (Pedone 1991) 497; Ziegler (n 20) para 3.\n²³ See: D Hollis, ‘The Influence of War; the War for Influence’ (2018) 32 Temple International &amp; Comparative Law Journal 31, 40; I Navarette, ‘L’Espionnage en Temps de Paix en Droit International Public’ (2015) 53 Canadian Yearbook of International Law 1, 30.\n²⁴ General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Adopted on 30 October 1947, entered into force on 1 January 1948) 55 UNTS 194.\n²⁵ General Agreement on Trade in Services (1869 UNTS 183) Annex 1B of the Marrakech Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization (Adopted on 15 April 1994, entered into force on 1 January 1995).\n²⁶ European Economic Area Agreement (Adopted on 2 May 1992, entered into force on 1 January 1994).\n²⁷ North American Free Trade Agreement (Adopted on 17 December 1992, entered into force on 1 January 1994) 32 ILM 289.\n²⁸ ASEAN Free Trade Area Agreement (Adopted on 28 January 1992, entered into force 1 January 2003).\n²⁹ Treaty Establishing the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (Adopted on 5 November 1993, entered into force on 8 December 1994) 33 ILM 1067.\n³⁰ For instance, the European Court of Justice (ECJ), the WTO Appellate Body and the COMESA Court of Justice.\n³¹ For instance, electoral rights of citizens are protected under art 25 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR).

The ICJ previously mentioned: '[h]owever, the assertion of a commitment raises the question of the possibility of a State binding itself by agreement in relation to a question of domestic policy, such as that relating to the holding of free elections on its territory. The Court cannot discover, within the range of subjects open to international agreement, any obstacle or provision to hinder a State from making a commitment of this kind.'\nThibault Moulin\nObviously, this is extremely problematic. Let us imagine, for instance, that the Russians did not carry out a hack-and-leak operation against the DNC, but blackmailed the US President into resigning or directly tampered with the election results. Alternatively, let us imagine that ‘State A’ and ‘State B’ are both competing to sell jet-fighters to ‘State C’. State A decides to infect the electronic systems of the jet-fighters manufactured by State B, in order to cause failures, damage their reputation, end their production and —at the end of the day—win the bid and eliminate a competitor. If these areas are not within the domaine réservé anymore, then even those extreme forms of meddling in the political or economic affairs of another state would not qualify as prohibited interventions.\nAnother problem with the concept of domaine réservé is that it fails to regulate those cyber operations exclusively directed against private actors, even if they are vital to the social and cultural system of a state. For instance, the cyberattacks against Sony Pictures Entertainment (SPE) in 2014 revealed the attempts of foreign governments to meddle with values that are essential to liberal democracies, such as freedom of expression. As a matter of fact, 'the real motive of the operation appears to have been an attempt to prevent the film's global distribution as well as an attempt to deter SPE and other studios from insulting the North Korean regime'. It must be said that this attempt was partially successful, as SPE had to cancel the film's release. This decision was criticised by President Obama himself, who declared:\n[w]e cannot have a society where some dictator someplace can start imposing censorship here in the United States ... Imagine if producers and distributors and others start engaging in self-censorship because they don't want to offend the sensibilities of someone who's sensibilities probably need to be offended.\nYet, and by virtue of the lex lata, the fact that such attacks were exclusively targeting a private company excludes the possibility to describe them in terms of prohibited interventions. And indeed, the US government opted for an\n33 A 'social system' may be defined as 'the patterned series of interrelationships existing between individuals, groups, and institutions and forming a coherent whole'.

Alternatively, let us imagine that the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) launches a series of attacks against the movie industry in France, to protest the upcoming release of a similar comedy depicting the North Korean regime. They paralyse the movie industry, and studios experience significant economic losses. The goal is to put such pressure on the Minister of Culture that he is forced to refuse to grant the movie a ‘visa d’exploitation’ (ie the authorisation to broadcast a film).⁴⁰ If one admits that restrictions to the freedom of expression are still part of the domaine réservé—which is arguably not the case, as human rights conventions usually regulate this area⁴¹—these attacks are more likely to qualify as interventions because the private actor was only targeted to obtain something from the state. In fact, attacks against the movie industry or newspapers are on the rise, and the resort to ‘criminal hackers’ might just ‘provide a cheap and easy way of censoring the press’.⁴² To alleviate this risk, I suggest replacement of the old-fashioned concept of domaine réservé with the newer domaine privilégié.\n## B. The concept of domaine privilégié\nThe objections raised against the concept of domaine réservé are the following: it has been stripped of most of its content and it is maladjusted to the new contribution of non-state actors to the exercise of fundamental freedoms. Consequently, a domaine réservé—based principle of non-interventions fails to protect the free choice and the stability of a political, economic, social or cultural system from foreign attacks. This is where the domaine privilégié comes in, as it appears necessary to opt for a concept with clear-cut contours, which remains unaffected by the development of international law, and protects the fundamental interests of a state and its population.⁴³ In fact, this concept of\nany attempt to coerce the US government to take a particular course of action’: N Tsagourias, ‘Electoral Cyber Interference, Self-determination and the Principle of Non-intervention in Cyberspace’ (2019) 8 <www.ssrn.com 2020=\"\" abstract=\"3438567\"> accessed 6 February 2020.\n³⁹ D Chiacu and S Holland, ‘Obama Says Sony Hack Not an Act of War’ Reuters (22 December 2014) <www.reuters.com 2020=\"\" article=\"\" obama-says-sony-hack-not-an-act-of-war-iduskbn0jx1mh20141222=\"\" us-sony-cybersecurity-usa=\"\"> accessed 1 May 2020.\n⁴⁰ Code du cinéma et de l’image animée, art L 211-1.\n⁴¹ Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (ECHR) (adopted 4 November 1950, entered into force 3 September 1953) 213 UNTS 22, art 10§2; ICCPR, art 19.\n⁴² M Nichols and L Charbonneau, ‘Cyber Attacks Against Media on the Rise, Rights Group Says’ Reuters (15 February 2013) <www.reuters.com 2020=\"\" article=\"\" net-us-media-cyberattacks=\"\" cyber-attacks-against-media-on-the-rise-rights-group-says-idusbre91d1ln20130214=\"\"> accessed 25 February 2020.\n⁴³ As once underlined by Antonios Tzanakopoulos: ‘[t]hings would be different if it could be shown that states possess a certain bundle of inherent rights which they</www.reuters.com></www.reuters.com></www.ssrn.com>\nThibault Moulin\n'fundamental', 'vital' or 'essential' interests materialises in certain areas of international law and may help theorising the domaine privilégié.⁴⁴\nBy virtue of the protective principle, states may establish jurisdiction over certain crimes that affect their vital interests,⁴⁵ irrespective of the place where they occurred, the citizenship of the author or where he/she lives.⁴⁶ The protected interests typically include state security and public safety—ie against terrorism, espionage, murder of government officials, hostage-taking—as well as economic and social stability—ie against counterfeiting of currency and various offences, such as 'falsification of official documents, perjury before consular officials, and conspiracy to violate immigration or customs laws'.⁴⁷ It is worth noting, thus, that 'the protective principle can be invoked with respect to a far broader range of acts than the rights to self-defence'.⁴⁸\nIn addition, Article 25 of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (DARS) acknowledges the existence of a ground for precluding wrongfulness called 'necessity'.

An interruption of</www.echr.coe.int>\nThibault Moulin\nAgo took pains, though, to distinguish necessity from the naturalist doctrine of the ‘Fundamental Rights of States’. The early roots of this doctrine can be found in Hobbes’s writings,⁶¹ and it was theorised by authors such as Wolff and Vattel. Wolff considered that nations had a ‘duty of self-preservation’.⁶² Hence, ‘every nation ha[d] the right to those means by which it can, as far as possible, avert the peril of destruction and avoid those things which can bring destruction upon it’.⁶³ Vattel defined certain ‘inalienable rights’ of nations, those required by ‘necessity’ or for its ‘preservation’—and their satisfaction usually justified the use of force.⁶⁴ Years later, Gidel thought that states had ‘fundamental’ or ‘inherent’ rights, which were ‘absolute, inviolable and unalienable’, and included ‘preservation, independence, equality, respect, international trade’.⁶⁵ Self-preservation actually gained a negative reputation,⁶⁶ as it was often ‘the criterion used to justify the rights of states to have recourse to arms’ and ‘for the violation of the rights of other subjects’.⁶⁷ Yet, literature of the post-war era reveals an alternative reading of self-preservation, which is more respectful of the rights of other states. For instance, Alfaro highlighted that ‘[s]elf-preservation rests upon the reciprocal\nsupplies of petroleum products, with the resultant dangers for the country’s existence, could therefore seriously affect the public security …’: Campus Oil Limited and others v Minister for Industry and Energy and others (Judgment)  ECR 1984-02727, para 34; E Brosset, ‘Le protectionnisme et le motif de protection de la santé en droit de l’Union européenne’ (Hal, 2014) <https: 942752=\"\" docid=\"\" file=\"\" file/index=\"\" file@unione.europei_enne2.pdf=\"\" docid/942752=\"\" filename=\"\" hal.archives-ouvertes.fr=\"\"> accessed 5 May 2020.\n⁶¹ T Hobbes, Leviathan (1651), pt II, ch XVIII, para 6.

Hence, a nation had allegedly ‘the right of procuring provisions by force’, when a neighbour refused to sell its oversupply, ‘the right of innocent use’ of ‘inexhaustible’ resources, such as water and the sea, as well as the right to ‘force a passage when it [was] unjustly refused’, provided that there was ‘a real necessity [that] oblige[d] you to enter into the territory of others’. It then had the right to make use, ‘either by free consent or by force’, of ‘the ships, waggons, horses, or even the personal labour of foreigners’, and provided that it a ‘pressing want’ and pay ‘a compensation’ for them. Vattel also underlined this ‘right’ for ‘a nation of men’, to ‘procure women, who are absolutely necessary to its preservation’, and to use force if needed, and the right of foreigners to ‘mak[e] a settlement in the first country where they find land enough for themselves, without depriving the inhabitants of what is sufficient for them’.

Yet, in contrast with necessity or the early doctrine of self-preservation, it does not provide justification for breaching the rights of other states, but results in a duty of abstention: states must refrain from meddling with the domaine privilégié of other states. This domaine privilégié includes not only the elements necessary for the very survival of a state but also those that are essential for its independence, autonomy and stability.\nFirst, it protects the political organisation of the state, including the forms of government, the rule of law, personal, collective and political freedoms, as well as the electoral process in full (primary, local and general elections, referenda, etc). Under this new framework, the hack-and-leak operation that targeted the DNC would meddle with the American electoral process and, therefore, with the US domaine privilégié. It would also be affected in the event of cyber operations directed at the movie industry or press organs—like the SPE scenarios—as they seek to restrict the exercise of fundamental freedoms.\nSecondly, it encompasses internal and external security. For instance, the 2015 data breach at the US Office of Personnel Management (OPM) compromised the security of the USA, as it could 'reveal the identities of CIA [Central Intelligence Agency] operatives serving under diplomatic cover'.69 In this case, the domaine privilégié of the USA was obviously affected.\nThirdly, it incorporates major economic interests, ie 'interests so essential that a breach of them threatens the economic ... stability' of the state.70 Key and energy industries, major employers, transports, banking transactions and telecommunications may qualify as such. For instance, and considering that the petrochemical sector 'is a core part of the Saudi economy',71 the cyberattacks against oil companies in Saudi Arabia may affect its domaine privilégié. The same would be true for the 2017 NotPetya attacks, which were aimed at disrupting Ukraine's financial system.72 Insofar as they may provoke the downfall\n68 R Alfaro, 'The Rights and Duties of States' (1959) 97 Recueil des Cours 91, 112.\n69 E Nakashima, 'Hacks of OPM Databases Compromised 22.1 Million People, Federal Authorities Say' The Washington Post (9 July 2015) <www.washingtonpost.com 4=\"\" 4=\"\" 56.=\"\" [?utm_term=.b890029da58b=\"\" [?num_term=.b890029da58b=\"\" [?www.bis.cz=\"\" ]=\"\" accessed=\"\" and=\"\" are=\"\" as=\"\" atacks=\"\" be=\"\" been=\"\" by=\"\" c=\"\" c.=\"\" c.4=\"\" c.5=\"\" c.6=\"\" c.7=\"\" c.8=\"\" c.9=\"\" c.10=\"\" c.11=\"\" c.12=\"\" c.15=\"\" c.16.4=\"\" c.17=\"\" c.18.=\"\" c.2=\"\" c.3=\"\" c.4=\"\" c.5=\"\" c.6.=\"\" c.7=\"\" c.8.=\"\" c.9=\"\" c.100.=\"\" c.11=\"\" c.120.=\"\" c.13=\"\" c.14=\"\" c.15=\"\" c.16=\"\" c.17=\"\" c.18.=\"\" a=\"\" a.=\"\" a/cn.4=\"\" a/cp.10=\"\" a/p.10=\"\" a/=\"\" a/15=\"\" a/17=\"\" a/18=\"\" a/2015=\"\" a/2018=\"\" a/2018.=\"\" a/2020.=\"\" a/2020.=\"\" a/2020.=\"\" a/2020.=\"\" a/2020.=\"\" a/2020.=\"\" a/2020.=\"\" a/2020.=\"\" according=\"\" ac=\"\" acc.=\"\" against=\"\" a}=\"\" a}}=\"\" b=\"\" b.=\"\" b.10=\"\" b.11=\"\" b.12=\"\" b.15=\"\" b.17=\"\" b.18=\"\" b.2=\"\" b.3=\"\" b.4=\"\" b.5=\"\" b.6.=\"\" b.7=\"\" b.8=\"\" b.9=\"\" b.100=\"\" b.11=\"\" b.1200.=\"\" b.1200.=\"\" b.1200.=\"\" b.1200.=\"\" b.1200.=\"\" b.1200.\nThibault Moulin\nof the aviation industry in 'State B', the cyberattacks induced by 'State A' in the fictitious example above would also impair the former's domaine privilégié.\nFourthly, it embraces public services, including health and social systems. Hence, state-sponsored attacks against hospitals would obviously affect the domaine privilégié. For instance, in March 2020, the Brno University Hospital had to turn away patients 'suffering serious conditions', and 'urgent surgeries' were postponed following a cyberattack, which shutdown all computers.73 In such situations, the impact on the domaine privilégié is obvious.\nFifthly, the domaine privilégié may extend to the preservation of a state's environment. For example, the 2017 NotPetya attacks also broke the monitoring systems of the nuclear power plant in Chernobyl, and they could have led to long-lasting damage to Ukraine's environment.74\nForeign meddling with this domaine privilégié would be prohibited, unless adopted within the legal framework of countermeasures.75 If the proposed concept of domaine privilégié is clearly de lege ferenda,76 it results from state practice that some governments might actually be sympathetic, for example, to the protection of main economic interests through the principle of non-intervention.77\nworld/national-security/russian-military-was-behind-notpetya-cyberattack-in-ukraine-cia-concludes/2018/01/12/048d8506-f7ca-11e7-b34a-b85626af34ef_story.html&gt; accessed 9 May 2020.\n73 M Burgess, 'Hackers Are Targeting Hospitals Crippled by Coronavirus' WIRED (22 March 2020) <www.wired.co.uk article=\"\" coronavirus-hackers-cybercrime-phishing=\"\"> accessed 11 May 2020.\n74 A Griffin, \"Petya\" Cyber-attack: Chernobyl's Radiation Monitoring System Hit by Worldwide Hack' The Independent (27 June 2017) <www.independent.co.uk ber-latest-a7810941.html=\"\" europe=\"\" gerr=\"\" news=\"\" world=\"\" world'europe=\"\" www.independent.co.uk=\"\"> accessed 6 May 2020.\n75 'Countermeasures are unilateral measures adopted by a State (the \"injured State\") in response to the breach of its rights by the wrongful act of another State (the \"wrongdoing\" or \"target\" State) that affect the rights of the target State and are aimed at inducing it to provide cessation or reparations to the injured State.'

A reconceptualisation of coercion\nIn this section, I will first explain the traditional definition of the concept of coercion, and why it is unsatisfactory in the digital era (Subsection 4A). I then put forward my own reappraisal of the concept of coercion (Subsection 4B).\n## A. The traditional definition of coercion\nCoercion must be equated with the implementation of ‘coercive measures’ or ‘coercive methods’ and must be distinguished from the mere influence or persuasion.⁷⁸ In fact, Vattel described interference as an ‘attempt to put a constraint on [the] deliberations’ of another state,⁷⁹ whereas Kant put down that ‘[n]o State shall by force interfere with the constitution or government of another State’.⁸⁰ The Montevideo Convention on the Rights and Duties of States of 1933 established a duty of non-recognition of situations ‘obtained by force whether this consist[ed] in the employment of arms, in threatening diplomatic representations, or in any other effective coercive measures’.⁸¹ The Charter of the Organization of American States (OAS) prevented states from ‘us[ing] or encouraging[ing] the use of coercive measures of an economic or political character in order to force the sovereign will of another state and obtain from it advantages of any kind’.⁸² It also underlined that ‘[n]o territorial acquisitions or special advantages obtained either by force or by other means of coercion shall be recognized’.⁸³ In the Nicaragua case, the ICJ used the term ‘methods of coercion’.⁸⁴ Another question that arises is whether intention is necessary. An analysis of the ICJ case law confirms that intention must be taken into account.⁸⁵\nAssemblée Nationale (France), ‘Première Séance Du Lundi 13 Avril 2015’ (13 April 2015) <www.assemblee-nationale.fr 14=\"\" 14-cri=\"\" 2014-2015=\"\" 20150212.asp#p511027=\"\"> accessed 13 February 2020.

For a contrary view, see:</http:></www.assemblee-nationale.fr></www.assemblee-nationale.fr>\nThibault Moulin\nHowever, the sole intention to secure change or to put pressure—in contrast with, for instance, the intention to overthrow a government—is sufficient. As the Court noted in the Nicaragua case:\n... in international law, if one State, with a view to the coercion of another State, supports and assists armed bands in that State whose purpose is to overthrow the government of that State, that amounts to an intervention by the one State in the internal affairs of the other, whether or not the political objective of the State giving such support and assistance is equally far-reaching.⁸⁶\nIn fact, the Court did not find it necessary ‘to seek to establish whether the intention of the United States to secure a change of governmental policies in Nicaragua went so far as to be equated with an endeavour to overthrow the Nicaraguan Government’.⁸⁷ This criterion was not challenged by the judgment pertaining to the Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo.⁸⁸ It is true that the Court found that non-intervention was violated ‘even if the objectives of Uganda were not to overthrow President Kabila’, and were intended ‘to securing towns and airports for reason of its perceived security needs, and in support of the parallel activity of those engaged in civil war’.⁸⁹ Yet, this position may be explained by the fact that a prohibited use of force was also found.⁹⁰ In its traditional sense, coercion thus occurs when a state deploys those means of pressure against another state, which are of a sufficiently serious nature to, and with the intention to, compel the latter to act in a certain way—or to refrain from acting in a certain way—and against its own will.⁹¹ Coercion is not a result-\nS Watts, ‘Low-intensity Cyber Operations and the Principle of Non-intervention’ in JD Ohlin, K Govern and C Finkelstein (eds), *Cyber War: Law and Ethics for Virtual Conflicts* (OUP 2015) 268.\n⁸⁶ Nicaragua (n 1) para 241. ‘With a view to the coercion’ was translated in the French version into ‘exercer une pression’ (ie ‘put pressure’).\n⁸⁷ ibid. Yet, it was ‘clearly established’ that ‘the United States intended, by its support of the contras, to coerce the Government of Nicaragua’, and ‘that the intention of the contras themselves was to overthrow the present Government of Nicaragua’.\n⁸⁸ Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo (n 16).\n⁸⁹ ibid, para 163.\n⁹⁰ ibid, paras 164 and 165.\n⁹¹ ‘Coercion in inter-State relations involves the government of one State compelling the government of another State to think or act in a certain way by applying various kinds of pressure, threats, intimidation or the use of force’: C Joyner, ‘Coercion’ in R Wolfrum et al (eds), *Max Planck Encyclopaedia of Public International Law* (OUP, online edition, 2006) para 1. ‘Coercion’ is defined by the Black’s Law Dictionary as the ‘compulsion of a free agent by physical, moral, or economic force or threat of physical force’: definition of ‘coercion’, *Black’s Law Dictionary* (10th edn, 2014). The French translation—‘contrainte’—confirms this meaning and may be defined as follows: ‘[a]ction de contraindre, de forcer quelqu’un à agir contre sa volonté; pression morale ou physique, violence exercée sur lui.’ See: Definition of ‘contrainte’ (*Larousse*) &lt;www.larousse.fr/dictionnaires/francais/contrainte/18670#pWqM8QLtC0uMc51R.99&gt; accessed 26 March 2020.

For instance, the ICJ concluded in the Nicaragua case that the principle of non-intervention was breached by the USA even if the attempt at securing political change failed.⁹²\nThis understanding of coercion sets a high threshold and most cyber operations do not pass this test.⁹³ If a state was demanding another one to declare the wrong candidate a winner of the elections, or to declare the favourite candidate ineligible on false grounds, under the threat of launching a debilitating wave of cyberattacks, then the criterion of coercion would be met. Yet, it constitutes a textbook case which will rarely (if ever) happen in practice. In practice, democracy, freedom of expression or the proper functioning of infrastructures (among others) are hindered without a need for ‘compelling’ a state through the deployment of ‘coercive methods’. If Russia’s objective was to help Trump in the case of the DNC,⁹⁴ voters or the government were not ‘coerced’ stricto sensu. The former were given stolen information and fake news to persuade them to vote for Donald Trump—or ‘not vote at all’.⁹⁵ Then, state-sponsored attacks often take the form of ‘cyber-vandalism’ and would not pass the coercion test either. Let us take two actual examples of attacks against press organs. In April 2015, the French television network TV5Monde was the victim of a cyberattack directed by the so-called ‘CyberCaliphate’, who claimed to belong to the Islamic State.⁹⁶ The distribution of programmes was interrupted for hours.⁹⁷ Two months later, investigations revealed that the attack was more likely sponsored by Moscow and may constitute nothing more than an act of retaliation in reaction to the French and European measures adopted against\nPellet, Droit International Public (LGDJ 2009) 1025–26; Government (the Netherlands) (n 11).\n⁹² Nicaragua (n 1) para 292(3).\n⁹³ The USA, through the voice of Brian Egan, acknowledged that non-intervention was ‘generally viewed as a relatively narrow rule of customary international law …’.

This may appear, from a certain perspective, as highly unsatisfactory, and it reveals that the concept of ‘coercion’ is in need of a reappraisal, to fit the new peculiarities of cyberattacks.¹⁰⁵\n## B. The reappraisal of coercion\nAs mentioned above, ‘coercion’ historically occurs ‘when a State deploys those means of pressure against another State, that are of a sufficiently serious nature to, and with the intention to, compel the latter to act in a certain way – or to refrain from acting in a certain way – and against its own will’. Yet, this definition is unsatisfactory in the cyber realm and fails to grasp new types of highly disruptive cyberattacks.¹⁰⁶ Any reappraisal of the coercion is a risky exercise, though, and we must beware of excessively watering down this concept, at the risk of hindering basic interstate relations.\nIn particular, the distinction between plain ‘influence’ and constraint must be maintained.¹⁰⁷ It is likely that states will use the information they obtained through cyberespionage operations to influence the negotiation strategies and decision-making of other states, in line with their own interests.¹⁰⁸ It is also likely that states that suffered cyberattacks or acts of cyberespionage will adapt their internal and external policies, either for the purpose of repairing the damage or for preventing further strikes. For instance, after the revelations on mass surveillance of the National Security Agency (NSA), Germany did not want to depend on US technologies anymore and decided to create a new agency to\n¹⁰⁵ The principle of due diligence might however be relevant to address those situations.

State A makes a $85 million offer, whereas State B makes a $83 million offer. State A finally wins the contract, after making another offer: $82 million. State A was indeed obliged—due to the lower price proposed by State B—to change its position. Then, let us imagine that the companies based in ‘State D’ manufacture cars and sell them in large quantities abroad. A few years later, companies in ‘State E’ start manufacturing cars to a lower price, and the car industry collapses in State D, prompting the latter in renewing its economic or tax policies. State D indeed had—due to the economic emergence of State E—to review its policies. Let us take a third and last example. State F is a developing country that depends on foreign aid to fund the police. Following a wave of protest, the police in State F fires teargas and rubber bullets on demonstrators. State G—which is a donor—is shocked and decides to halt some aid. To remedy this situation, State F decides to cut education funding. In fact, State G prompted State F into changing its policies. If we equate ‘coercion’ with ‘influence’, these classical situations might result in prohibited interventions—and generate countermeasures in return.

They deprive actors of control and render them powerless instead.¹¹³ With election meddling, citizens are deprived of the possibility of expressing themselves democratically.¹¹⁴ For instance, the goal of the hack-and-leak operation that targeted the DNC was to reshape the public opinion and ‘represent[ed] the most recent expression of Moscow’s longstanding desire to undermine the US-led liberal democratic order’.¹¹⁵ Attacks directed at the media industry deprive organs of the possibility to express themselves and deprive citizens of the right to information. NotPetya attacks deprived Ukraine of the possibility to control financial transactions and the radioactivity level at the Chernobyl plant. It is thus necessary, for a reappraisal of coercion, to take those particularities into account. In a digital context, coercion may then be conceptualised as ‘a deprivation of control (1), resulting from the deliberate action of another State, as evidenced prima facie by the characteristics of the malware used (2)’.

For instance, the Australian government suggests: ‘[a] prohibited intervention is one that interferes by coercive means (in the sense that they effectively deprive another state of the ability to control, decide upon or govern matters of an inherently sovereign nature) …’. See: Government (Australia) (n 11). I first read it in Harriet Moynihan’s paper, where this definition is discussed: H Moynihan, ‘The Application of International Law to State Cyberattacks’ (Chatham House, 2019) 40–43 <www.chathamhouse.org default=\"\" files=\"\" files/publications=\"\" research=\"\" sites=\"\" research/2019-11-29-intl-law-cyberattacks.pdf=\"\"> accessed 6 February 2020. Robert Jennings and Arthur Watts also suggested: ‘to constitute intervention, the interference must be forcible or dictatorial, or otherwise coercive, in effect depriving the state intervened against of control over the matter in question’. See: Jennings and Watts (n 16) 432.\n¹¹⁴ Tampering with the electoral results has been described as prohibited interventions by some states, including Australia, Switzerland, the UK and the USA. See: Caflisch (n 11) 105; Attorney General’s Office and Jeremy Wright (UK) (n 8); Egan, ‘Remarks on International Law and Stability in Cyberspace’ (n 11); Government (Australia) (n 11). Describing ballot stuffing in terms of prohibited intervention is however not a new idea. In the 1980s, the US Congress highlighted that ‘[u]nilateral intervention in the internal affairs of other nations is antithetical to democracy. It contravenes international treaties and norms that are vital to the long-term peace and security of all nations in the Hemisphere. Intervention violates the right of self-determination which is the underpinning of every democracy.’ See: United States Congress House Committee on Appropriations Subcommittee on Foreign Operations and Related Agencies Appropriations, Foreign Assistance and Related Programs Appropriations for 1985: Hearings Before a Subcommittee of the Committee on Appropriations, House of Representatives, Ninety-Eighth Congress, Second Session (US Government Printing Office 1984) 662. Experts now suggest that doxfare might be at odd with self-determination, but clearly disagree as to whether it also constitutes a prohibited intervention.

It means that a prohibited intervention occurs as soon as these two conditions are met, even if the victim failed to equip itself with state-of-the-art protections, or reacted too late—for instance, due to technical or bureaucratic reasons. In the case of NotPetya, hackers exploited the vulnerabilities of older versions of Windows, for which corrective patches were nonetheless available.¹¹⁶ In the case of the OPM, 'persistent deficiencies' in the IT security programme had been reported before the data breach and were probably not fixed when it happened.¹¹⁷ Yet, these deficiencies do not alter the seriousness of the attacks: a deliberate deprivation of control still occurs.\nIt is finally appropriate to touch on the issue of economic cyberespionage. Under the framework put forward in this article, it is clear that only the most severe forms of intellectual property theft (if there are any) would qualify as prohibited interventions—those prone to threatening the economic stability of a state. If this phenomenon is indeed problematic and calls—in my opinion—for legal answers, tailor-made rules are required. In that sense, the Paris Call is interesting, as signatories pledged to '[p]revent ICT-enabled theft of intellectual property, including trade secrets or other confidential business information, with the intent of providing competitive advantages to companies or commercial sector'.¹¹⁸\n# 5. Conclusion\nIn this article, I championed the applicability of non-intervention in cyberspace. In my view, such applicability is welcomed by the international community and does not raise theoretical questions about the nature of sovereignty or the militarisation of cyberspace. However, I expressed fears that this principle becomes obsolete if we keep equating 'matters in which each State is permitted, by the principle of State sovereignty, to decide freely'¹¹⁹ with the notion of domaine réservé. I thus recommended that, for the purpose of non-intervention, we ought to adopt the notion of state domaine privilégié. The latter encompasses the political organisation of a state, its internal and external security, major economic interests and public services (including the health and social systems), as well as the preservation of a state's environment. Then, I turned to the concept of coercion, arguing in favour of a 'balanced' reinterpretation of coercion—ie a\n¹¹⁶ 'What Is Petya and NotPetya Ransomware' (McAfee) <www.mcafee.com enterprise=\"\" fr-fr=\"\" security-awareness=\"\" ransomware=\"\" petya.html=\"\"> accessed 12 May 2020.\n¹¹⁷ OPM (the USA), 'Semi-Annual Report to Congress' (2015) <www.opm.gov for=\"\" reports-publications=\"\" semi-annual-reports=\"\" sar52.pdf=\"\" www.opm.gov=\"\"> accessed 12 May 2020; D Auerbach, 'The OPM Breach Is a Catastrophe' Slate (16 June 2015) <https: 06=\"\" 2015=\"\" slate.com=\"\" opm-hack-its-a-catastrophe-heres-how-the-government-can-stop-the-next-one.html=\"\" technology=\"\"> accessed 12 May 2020.\n¹¹⁸ 'Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace' (n 8).\n¹¹⁹ Nicaragua (n 1) para 205.</https:></www.opm.gov></www.opm.gov>\nReviving the Principle of Non-Intervention in Cyberspace 447\nreconceptualisation that takes into account situations where states or non-state actors are deprived of control, but does not go as far as equating coercion with influence. This would indeed totally hinder international relations. In the end, it may be argued that a prohibited intervention occurs whenever a state (or a non-state actor located in that state) is deprived of control over matters within the domaine privilégié, due to the deliberate action of another state (as evidenced prima facie by the characteristics of the malware used). Yet, any cyber activity emanating from a state that prompts a given reaction in another state should not automatically be viewed as a prohibited intervention. After all—and as well illustrated by Denmark—‘[a]s hacker groups continuously perfect their technical skills and capabilities, state institutions will be forced to heighten their security levels and are thus engaged in a constant cyber-race.’¹²⁰\n¹²⁰ Centre for Cybersecurity (Denmark), ‘The Cyber Threat Against Denmark’ (2016) 4 <https: cfcs=\"\" cfcsdocuments=\"\" cfcsdocuments=\"\" threat%20assessment%20-%20the%20cyber%20threat%20against%20denmark.pdf=\"\" fe-ddis.dk=\"\"> accessed 29 February 2020.</https:>\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jcsl/article/25/3/423/5879500 by Eastman Dental Institute user on 03 July 2025"

In contrast, the relevance of the non-intervention principle is accepted by states and raises less questions about the ‘territoriality’ or the ‘militarization’ of cyberspace. At first sight, it thus appears as a convenient source for the regulation of cyberthreats. However, the *Nicaragua* case also established a stringent test for a foreign interference to qualify as an unlawful intervention. First, it must bear ‘on matters in which each State is permitted, by the principle of State sovereignty to decide freely’ (ie the ‘domaine réservé’). Then, it must involve ‘methods of coercion in regard to such choices’. I contend that both criteria are maladjusted to address cyberthreats and must be reconceptualised. In fact, the *domaine réservé* describes domains where states are free from international rules. However, few domains, including electoral processes or main economic orientations, are totally isolated from international law. I thus argue that it must be reconceptualised into the so-called ‘domaine privilégié’. It consists of a domain with clear-cut contours, unaffected by the developments of international law, which encompasses the fundamental interests of a state and its population. Then, coercion describes situations where a state is compelled to act, or to refrain from acting, in a certain fashion. This traditional approach is also problematic, and I argue that coercion must be understood in terms of deprivation of control.\n## 1. Introduction In his separate opinion attached to the *Nicaragua* case, ICJ President Nagendra Singh felt that he could not ‘conclude this opinion without emphasizing the key * Dr Thibault Moulin is a Teaching and Research Assistant at the Université Grenoble-Alpes, France. I am indebted to Professor Nicholas Tsagourias and the anonymous reviewers for their comments on an earlier draft. E-mail: thibault.moulin@univ-grenoble-alpes.fr Thibault Moulin importance of the doctrine of non-intervention in the affairs of States which is so vital for the peace and progress of the international community'. In fact, he considered that '[t]o ignore this doctrine is to undermine international order and to promote violence and bloodshed which may prove catastrophic in the end'. More than three decades later, international lawyers' attempts at regulating emerging technologies reveal that the 'principle' of non-intervention might be relevant in situations where there is no risk of 'bloodshed', in a world that lacks flesh and bones: cyberspace. In particular, there has been a renewed interest in this principle since the hack-and-leak operation that targeted the Democratic National Committee (DNC) in 2016 and the alleged interference of Russia in the US elections. If some commentators suggested that Moscow had 'cross[ed] a line', most experts nevertheless came to the conclusion that the so-called 'hack-and-leak' operations were not coercive, and did not constitute a prohibited intervention. The discomfort of the US government with describing this operation as a prohibited intervention was also clear.\nAs a matter of fact, Reviving the Principle of Non-Intervention in Cyberspace 425 the ICJ established a 2-fold test to determine the existence (or not) of a prohibited intervention. First, ‘[a] prohibited intervention must … be one bearing on matters in which each State is permitted, by the principle of State sovereignty, to decide freely’.⁶ This concept is also known as the ‘domaine réservé’ (reserved domain) of the state. Secondly, a prohibited intervention must use ‘methods of coercion in regard to such choices, which must remain free ones’.⁷ It appears that under this stringent test, most cyber operations and attempts at influence will never qualify as prohibited interventions. According to most experts and as suggested above, the main reason is that ‘methods of coercion’ are lacking. I nevertheless argue that this is only part of the problem: in fact, both features are maladjusted to address the characteristics of cyberthreats. My main point, then, is that they must be reconceptualised, and that a new definition of non-intervention in the cyberspace context must be achieved. If we fail to do so, the principle of non-intervention will fall into disuse with regard to cyberthreats. I thus demonstrate that the old-fashioned concept of domaine réservé must be reconceptualised into what I call the ‘domaine privilégié’ Response to Russian Malicious Cyber Activity and Harassment’ (29 December 2016) <https: 12=\"\"2016=\"\"29=\"\"document-president-actions-response-russian-malicious-cyber-activity=\"\"the-press-office=\"\"obamawhitehouse.archives.gov=\"\"> accessed 3 October 2019. Yet, as underlined by Ryan Goodman, ‘[a]ll official statements by the Obama administration appear to include a studied avoidance of whether the Russian actions do or do not violate international law … It is safe to assume the specific word choice in the President’s statement is highly deliberate.’ See: R Goodman, ‘International Law and the US Response to Russian Election Interference’ (Just Security, 2017) <www.just security.org 35999=\"\"international-law-response-russian-election-interference=\"\"></www.just></https:> accessed 25 November 2019. The same thing could be said for Sweden, when the government declared in 2017 that ‘IT attacks could … improperly influence the outcome of democratic elections’. See: Prime Minister’s Office (Sweden), ‘National Security Strategy’ (2017) 18 <www.government.se 4aa5de=\"\"contentassets=\"\"0e04164d7eed462aa511ab03c890372e=\"\"national-security-strategy.pdf=\"\"> accessed 26 March 2020. Denmark also called ‘hack-and-leak-operation[s]’ an ‘ambition to influence internal affairs in other countries’, but did not go as far as describing these activities as prohibited interventions.

France was perhaps the sole exception, as French Minister of Foreign Affairs Ayrault declared at the Parliament that any foreign interference in the presidential campaign of 2017 would constitute ‘a breach of the principle of non-intervention’ that could justify ‘retaliatory measures’. He added: ‘no foreign power is allowed to influence Frenchmen’s choice; no foreign power is allowed to choose the next President of the Republic’.

I also argue in favour of a balanced reinterpretation of the concept of coercion, in order to encompass serious forms of foreign meddling, which deprive actors of control and render them powerless. In the end, the proposed definition is that a prohibited intervention occurs whenever a state (or a non-state actor located in that state) is deprived of control over matters within the domaine privilégié, due to the deliberate action of another state (as evidenced prima facie by the characteristics of the malware used).\nAgainst this background, this article is structured as follows. In the next section, I explain that the principle of non-intervention is clearly applicable in cyberspace. I underline, in particular, that its application to cyberthreats is less controversial than other rules, namely sovereignty or the prohibition to use force—whose implementation in a 'digital' space instead of a 'physical' space remains disputed (Section 2). In the third section, I analyse what is domaine réservé and the reason why this concept is no longer adequate to address cyber activities. In particular, I raise doubts about the current integration of political processes and economic orientations within the domaine réservé, and I contend that it fails to protect those private actors that are vital to the social and cultural system of a state (such as press bodies). I then explain why the notion of domaine réservé should be replaced by the notion of domaine privilégié, what it means and how it would apply to cyberspace (Section 3). In the fourth section, I dwell on the concept of coercion and explain what it means. I underline that the traditional understanding of coercion fails to grasp situations where the state is deprived of its control, and I support a balanced reinterpretation of this concept (Section 4). Some conclusions are offered in the last section (Section 5).\n## 2.

It thus offers a well-established and valuable source of regulation in the digital sphere. Then, and contrary to sovereignty and the use of force, the application of non-intervention does not raise the thorny issue of the 'territoriality' of cyberspace. The difficulties in applying these concepts partly reside in the fact that they were conceived to apply in a physical space,¹³ in order to prevent trespass onto one's territory or the use of weapons by a state against the territory or the troops of another state. Yet, there is 'deep uncertainty about the treatment of cyberspace as just another physical space, like land, air, or sea - over which States may exercise sovereignty or control'.¹⁴ In contrast, with non- Information Space Activities Concept' (2000) <http: en=\"\"equity=\"\"publications=\"\"eng.mil.ru=\"\"more.htm?id=\"10845074@cmsArticle\"> accessed 24 February 2020.

Therefore, a state-sponsored activity can breach the principle of non-intervention, even in the absence of ground, air or naval operations on foreign territory.¹⁶ It is significant, in that sense, that the ICJ underlined that ‘[b]etween independent States, respect for territorial sovereignty is an essential foundation of international relations … and international law requires political integrity ¹⁵ Nicaragua (n 1) para 205.\n¹⁶ It may be noted that some authors resort to a subtle distinction between ‘non-interference’ and ‘non-intervention’. For instance, Niki Aloupi supports a ‘distinction between non-intervention (territorial integrity) and non-interference (independence and autonomy)’, which is ‘theoretically clear’. See: N Aloupi, ‘The Right to Non-intervention and Non-interference’ (2015) 4(3) Cambridge Journal of International and Comparative Law 566, 572. According to Karine Bannelier and Théodore Christakis, non-intervention ‘refers to the protection of the territory of the State, of its dominium, and that its violation would therefore involve the carrying out of material operations in foreign territory’. In contrast, non-interference ‘would refer to interference, without the authorization of the State, in the sphere of the exercise of its national sovereign powers and would, therefore, affect the imperium of the State’. See: K Bannelier and T Christakis, Cyber-Attacks, Prevention-Reactions: The Role of States and Private Actors (Les Cahiers de la Revue Défense Nationale 2017) 43. See also: P-M Dupuy and Y Kerbrat, Droit International Public, paras 117–19. Yet, and as noted by Michael Wood, ‘in most contexts, the two terms seem to be used interchangeably’. See: M Wood, ‘Non-intervention (Non-interference in Domestic Affairs)’ (Encyclopedia Princetoniensis) <https: 551=\"\"pesd.princeton.edu=\"\"node=\"\"> accessed 15 July 2020. According to some authors, the difference between an interference and an intervention lies elsewhere, in the fact that the sole intervention is coercive and consequently, unlawful. See: R Jennings and A Watts, Oppenheim’s International Law-Vol I: Peace (9th edn, OUP 2008) 432; C Henderson, The Use of Force and International Law 51; M Schmitt (ed), Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations 313. It may be noted that declarations and case law are of little help to cut a clear distinction between ‘non-intervention’ and ‘non-interference’. The blurring probably culminated in Declaration 2625, which is supposed to contain ‘principles of international law’. It indeed mentioned that ‘[n]o State or group of States has the right to intervene, directly or indirectly, for any reason whatever, in the internal or external affairs of any other State. Consequently, armed intervention and all other forms of interference or attempted threats against the personality of the State or against its political, economic and cultural elements, are in violation of international law.’ See: UNGA Res 2625. In 1986, the ICJ found that ‘[t]he principle of non-intervention involves the right of every sovereign State to conduct its affairs without outside interference’. See: Nicaragua (n 1) para 202. In 2005, the ICJ ruled that ‘Uganda had violated the sovereignty and also the territorial integrity of the DRC. Uganda’s actions equally constituted an interference in the internal affairs of the DRC … The unlawful military intervention by Uganda was of such a magnitude and duration that the Court consider[ed] it to be a grave violation’ of UN Charter’s art 2(4).

For the sake of clarity, I will use the term 'meddling' to describe 'the act of trying to change or have an influence on things that are not your responsibility', without a legal connotation. In contrast, I will use the term 'intervention' to describe those coercive—and unlawful—activities directed against the internal or external affairs of other states.\n# 3. A reconceptualisation of the domaine réservé In this section, I will first explain the concept of domaine réservé, and why this old-fashioned concept is unsatisfactory in the digital era (Subsection 3A). To alleviate this problem, I argue in favour of a reconceptualisation of the concept into a domaine privilégié (Subsection 3B).\n# A. The concept of domaine réservé The exact wording used by the ICJ in the Nicaragua case to address the first component of a prohibited intervention was the following:... the principle forbids all States or groups of States to intervene directly or indirectly in internal or external affairs of other States. A prohibited intervention must accordingly be one bearing on matters in which each State is permitted, by the principle of State sovereignty, to decide freely. One of these is the choice of a political, economic, social and cultural system, and the formulation of foreign policy.[19] This condition is often reconciled with the notion of state domaine réservé, which 'describes areas where States are free from international obligations and regulation'.[20] The challenge with the domaine réservé resides in its shifting contours. In fact, the Permanent Court of International Justice (PCIJ) underlined that '[t]he question whether a certain matter is or is not solely within the jurisdiction of a State [ie if it is part of the domaine réservé] is an essentially relative question; it depends on the development of international relations'.[21] However, few domains are now totally Reviving the Principle of Non-Intervention in Cyberspace 431 isolated from international law.²² For instance, states are increasingly constrained in their ability to make free economic decisions.²³ Free-trade agreements—the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT),²⁴ General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS),²⁵ European Economic Area (EEA),²⁶ North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA),²⁷ ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA)²⁸ and Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA),²⁹ to name just a few—have prospered, and judicial mechanisms have even been created to enforce some of them.³⁰ Thus, in the current state of international law, most economic questions pulled out of the domaine réservé. But that's not all. States entered into international agreements in the area of electoral process too.³¹ From a certain perspective, one might conclude that it is not within the domaine réservé anymore. After all, the ICJ made clear that '[a] State, which is free to decide upon the principle and methods of popular consultation within its domestic order, is sovereign for the purpose of accepting a limitation of its sovereignty in this field'.³² ²² P Kunig, ‘Intervention, Prohibition of’ in R Wolfrum et al (eds), Max Planck Encyclopaedia of Public International Law (OUP, online edition, 2008) para 3; J Verhoeven, ‘Non-intervention:\"Affaires intérieures\"ou\"Vie privée\"?’ in Le droit international au service de la paix, de la justice et du développement: mélanges Michel Virally 497; Ziegler (n 20) para 3.\n²³ See: D Hollis, ‘The Influence of War; the War for Influence’ (2018) 32 Temple International &amp; Comparative Law Journal 31, 40; I Navarette, ‘L’Espionnage en Temps de Paix en Droit International Public’ (2015) 53 Canadian Yearbook of International Law 1, 30.\n²⁴ General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Adopted on 30 October 1947, entered into force on 1 January 1948) 55 UNTS 194.\n²⁵ General Agreement on Trade in Services (1869 UNTS 183) Annex 1B of the Marrakech Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization (Adopted on 15 April 1994, entered into force on 1 January 1995).\n²⁶ European Economic Area Agreement (Adopted on 2 May 1992, entered into force on 1 January 1994).\n²⁷ North American Free Trade Agreement (Adopted on 17 December 1992, entered into force on 1 January 1994) 32 ILM 289.\n²⁸ ASEAN Free Trade Area Agreement (Adopted on 28 January 1992, entered into force 1 January 2003).\n²⁹ Treaty Establishing the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (Adopted on 5 November 1993, entered into force on 8 December 1994) 33 ILM 1067.\n³⁰ For instance, the European Court of Justice (ECJ), the WTO Appellate Body and the COMESA Court of Justice.\n³¹ For instance, electoral rights of citizens are protected under art 25 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). See: ICCPR (adopted 16 December 1966, entered into force 23 March 1976) 999 UNTS 171, art 25; ‘General Comment No. 25: The Right to Participate in Public Affairs, Voting Rights and the Right of Equal Access to Public Service’ (art 25) (1996) CCPR/C/21/Rev.1/Add.7.\n³² Nicaragua (n 1) para 259. The ICJ previously mentioned: '[h]owever, the assertion of a commitment raises the question of the possibility of a State binding itself by agreement in relation to a question of domestic policy, such as that relating to the holding of free elections on its territory. The Court cannot discover, within the range of subjects open to international agreement, any obstacle or provision to hinder a State from making a commitment of this kind.'\nThibault Moulin Obviously, this is extremely problematic. Let us imagine, for instance, that the Russians did not carry out a hack-and-leak operation against the DNC, but blackmailed the US President into resigning or directly tampered with the election results. Alternatively, let us imagine that ‘State A’ and ‘State B’ are both competing to sell jet-fighters to ‘State C’. State A decides to infect the electronic systems of the jet-fighters manufactured by State B, in order to cause failures, damage their reputation, end their production and —at the end of the day—win the bid and eliminate a competitor. If these areas are not within the domaine réservé anymore, then even those extreme forms of meddling in the political or economic affairs of another state would not qualify as prohibited interventions.\nAnother problem with the concept of domaine réservé is that it fails to regulate those cyber operations exclusively directed against private actors, even if they are vital to the social[33] and cultural system of a state.[34] For instance, the cyberattacks against Sony Pictures Entertainment (SPE) in 2014 revealed the attempts of foreign governments to meddle with values that are essential to liberal democracies, such as freedom of expression. As a matter of fact, 'the real motive of the operation appears to have been an attempt to prevent the film's global distribution as well as an attempt to deter SPE and other studios from insulting the North Korean regime'.[35] It must be said that this attempt was partially successful, as SPE had to cancel the film's release.[36] This decision was criticised by President Obama himself, who declared: [w]e cannot have a society where some dictator someplace can start imposing censorship here in the United States... Imagine if producers and distributors and others start engaging in self-censorship because they don't want to offend the sensibilities of someone who's sensibilities probably need to be offended.[37] Yet, and by virtue of the lex lata, the fact that such attacks were exclusively targeting a private company excludes the possibility to describe them in terms of prohibited interventions.[38] And indeed, the US government opted for an Reviving the Principle of Non-Intervention in Cyberspace 433 alternative term: ‘an act of cyber-vandalism’.³⁹ Let us imagine that the goal of North Korea was to prompt the adoption of a new law in the USA, which would increase movie censorship. Alternatively, let us imagine that the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) launches a series of attacks against the movie industry in France, to protest the upcoming release of a similar comedy depicting the North Korean regime. They paralyse the movie industry, and studios experience significant economic losses. The goal is to put such pressure on the Minister of Culture that he is forced to refuse to grant the movie a ‘visa d’exploitation’ (ie the authorisation to broadcast a film).⁴⁰ If one admits that restrictions to the freedom of expression are still part of the domaine réservé—which is arguably not the case, as human rights conventions usually regulate this area⁴¹—these attacks are more likely to qualify as interventions because the private actor was only targeted to obtain something from the state. In fact, attacks against the movie industry or newspapers are on the rise, and the resort to ‘criminal hackers’ might just ‘provide a cheap and easy way of censoring the press’.⁴² To alleviate this risk, I suggest replacement of the old-fashioned concept of domaine réservé with the newer domaine privilégié.\n## B. The concept of domaine privilégié The objections raised against the concept of domaine réservé are the following: it has been stripped of most of its content and it is maladjusted to the new contribution of non-state actors to the exercise of fundamental freedoms. Consequently, a domaine réservé—based principle of non-interventions fails to protect the free choice and the stability of a political, economic, social or cultural system from foreign attacks. This is where the domaine privilégié comes in, as it appears necessary to opt for a concept with clear-cut contours, which remains unaffected by the development of international law, and protects the fundamental interests of a state and its population.⁴³ In fact, this concept of any attempt to coerce the US government to take a particular course of action’: N Tsagourias, ‘Electoral Cyber Interference, Self-determination and the Principle of Non-intervention in Cyberspace’ (2019) 8 <www.ssrn.com 2020=\"\"abstract=\"3438567\"> accessed 6 February 2020.\n³⁹ D Chiacu and S Holland, ‘Obama Says Sony Hack Not an Act of War’ Reuters (22 December 2014) <www.reuters.com 2020=\"\"article=\"\"obama-says-sony-hack-not-an-act-of-war-iduskbn0jx1mh20141222=\"\"us-sony-cybersecurity-usa=\"\"> accessed 1 May 2020.\n⁴⁰ Code du cinéma et de l’image animée, art L 211-1.\n⁴¹ Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (ECHR) (adopted 4 November 1950, entered into force 3 September 1953) 213 UNTS 22, art 10§2; ICCPR, art 19.\n⁴² M Nichols and L Charbonneau, ‘Cyber Attacks Against Media on the Rise, Rights Group Says’ Reuters (15 February 2013) <www.reuters.com 2020=\"\"article=\"\"net-us-media-cyberattacks=\"\"cyber-attacks-against-media-on-the-rise-rights-group-says-idusbre91d1ln20130214=\"\"> accessed 25 February 2020.\n⁴³ As once underlined by Antonios Tzanakopoulos: ‘[t]hings would be different if it could be shown that states possess a certain bundle of inherent rights which they</www.reuters.com></www.reuters.com></www.ssrn.com> Thibault Moulin 'fundamental', 'vital' or 'essential' interests materialises in certain areas of international law and may help theorising the domaine privilégié.⁴⁴ By virtue of the protective principle, states may establish jurisdiction over certain crimes that affect their vital interests,⁴⁵ irrespective of the place where they occurred, the citizenship of the author or where he/she lives.⁴⁶ The protected interests typically include state security and public safety—ie against terrorism, espionage, murder of government officials, hostage-taking—as well as economic and social stability—ie against counterfeiting of currency and various offences, such as 'falsification of official documents, perjury before consular officials, and conspiracy to violate immigration or customs laws'.⁴⁷ It is worth noting, thus, that 'the protective principle can be invoked with respect to a far broader range of acts than the rights to self-defence'.⁴⁸ In addition, Article 25 of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (DARS) acknowledges the existence of a ground for precluding wrongfulness called 'necessity'. Necessity may be invoked when an otherwise illegal measure 'is the only way for the State to safeguard an essential interest against a grave and imminent peril'.⁴⁹ Yet, the International Law Commission (ILC) made clear that 'essential interests' were not restricted to cases where the 'existence' of the state was in danger,⁵⁰ highlighting that necessity had also been invoked to prevent 'the extermination of a fur seal are not entitled to dispose of freely in the exercise of their sovereignty.'

The early roots of this doctrine can be found in Hobbes’s writings,⁶¹ and it was theorised by authors such as Wolff and Vattel. Wolff considered that nations had a ‘duty of self-preservation’.⁶² Hence, ‘every nation ha[d] the right to those means by which it can, as far as possible, avert the peril of destruction and avoid those things which can bring destruction upon it’.⁶³ Vattel defined certain ‘inalienable rights’ of nations, those required by ‘necessity’ or for its ‘preservation’—and their satisfaction usually justified the use of force.⁶⁴ Years later, Gidel thought that states had ‘fundamental’ or ‘inherent’ rights, which were ‘absolute, inviolable and unalienable’, and included ‘preservation, independence, equality, respect, international trade’.⁶⁵ Self-preservation actually gained a negative reputation,⁶⁶ as it was often ‘the criterion used to justify the rights of states to have recourse to arms’ and ‘for the violation of the rights of other subjects’.⁶⁷ Yet, literature of the post-war era reveals an alternative reading of self-preservation, which is more respectful of the rights of other states. For instance, Alfaro highlighted that ‘[s]elf-preservation rests upon the reciprocal supplies of petroleum products, with the resultant dangers for the country’s existence, could therefore seriously affect the public security …’: Campus Oil Limited and others v Minister for Industry and Energy and others (Judgment) [1984] ECR 1984-02727, para 34; E Brosset, ‘Le protectionnisme et le motif de protection de la santé en droit de l’Union européenne’ <https: 942752=\"\"docid=\"\"file=\"\"file/index=\"\"file@unione.europei_enne2.pdf=\"\"docid/942752=\"\"filename=\"\"hal.archives-ouvertes.fr=\"\"> accessed 5 May 2020.\n⁶¹ T Hobbes, Leviathan (1651), pt II, ch XVIII, para 6.

Hence, a nation had allegedly ‘the right of procuring provisions by force’, when a neighbour refused to sell its oversupply, ‘the right of innocent use’ of ‘inexhaustible’ resources, such as water and the sea, as well as the right to ‘force a passage when it [was] unjustly refused’, provided that there was ‘a real necessity [that] oblige[d] you to enter into the territory of others’. It then had the right to make use, ‘either by free consent or by force’, of ‘the ships, waggons, horses, or even the personal labour of foreigners’, and provided that it a ‘pressing want’ and pay ‘a compensation’ for them. Vattel also underlined this ‘right’ for ‘a nation of men’, to ‘procure women, who are absolutely necessary to its preservation’, and to use force if needed, and the right of foreigners to ‘mak[e] a settlement in the first country where they find land enough for themselves, without depriving the inhabitants of what is sufficient for them’. The edition used for this article is the following: E de Vattel, The Law of Nations (Liberty Fund 2008).\n⁶⁵ G Gidel, Droit et Devoirs des Nations (1925) 10 Recueil des Cours 537, 541, 542.\n⁶⁶ Cassela (n 59) 184.\n⁶⁷ M Kohen, ‘The Notion of State Survival in International Law’ in LB de Chazournes and P Sands (eds), International Law, the International Court of Justice and Nuclear Weapons 300.</https:> Reviving the Principle of Non-Intervention in Cyberspace 437 duty of every State not to injure, impair or destroy the integrity of any State nor to violate any of its legal rights'.68 Hence, I argue that non-intervention, too, should protect the fundamental interests of a state, rather than being limited to the domaine réservé. Yet, in contrast with necessity or the early doctrine of self-preservation, it does not provide justification for breaching the rights of other states, but results in a duty of abstention: states must refrain from meddling with the domaine privilégié of other states. This domaine privilégié includes not only the elements necessary for the very survival of a state but also those that are essential for its independence, autonomy and stability.\nFirst, it protects the political organisation of the state, including the forms of government, the rule of law, personal, collective and political freedoms, as well as the electoral process in full (primary, local and general elections, referenda, etc). Under this new framework, the hack-and-leak operation that targeted the DNC would meddle with the American electoral process and, therefore, with the US domaine privilégié. It would also be affected in the event of cyber operations directed at the movie industry or press organs—like the SPE scenarios—as they seek to restrict the exercise of fundamental freedoms.\nSecondly, it encompasses internal and external security. For instance, the 2015 data breach at the US Office of Personnel Management (OPM) compromised the security of the USA, as it could 'reveal the identities of CIA [Central Intelligence Agency] operatives serving under diplomatic cover'.69 In this case, the domaine privilégié of the USA was obviously affected.\nThirdly, it incorporates major economic interests, ie 'interests so essential that a breach of them threatens the economic... stability' of the state.70 Key and energy industries, major employers, transports, banking transactions and telecommunications may qualify as such. For instance, and considering that the petrochemical sector 'is a core part of the Saudi economy',71 the cyberattacks against oil companies in Saudi Arabia may affect its domaine privilégié. The same would be true for the 2017 NotPetya attacks, which were aimed at disrupting Ukraine's financial system.72 Insofar as they may provoke the downfall Thibault Moulin of the aviation industry in 'State B', the cyberattacks induced by 'State A' in the fictitious example above would also impair the former's domaine privilégié.\nFourthly, it embraces public services, including health and social systems. Hence, state-sponsored attacks against hospitals would obviously affect the domaine privilégié. For instance, in March 2020, the Brno University Hospital had to turn away patients 'suffering serious conditions', and 'urgent surgeries' were postponed following a cyberattack, which shutdown all computers.73 In such situations, the impact on the domaine privilégié is obvious.\nFifthly, the domaine privilégié may extend to the preservation of a state's environment. For example, the 2017 NotPetya attacks also broke the monitoring systems of the nuclear power plant in Chernobyl, and they could have led to long-lasting damage to Ukraine's environment.74 Foreign meddling with this domaine privilégié would be prohibited, unless adopted within the legal framework of countermeasures.75 If the proposed concept of domaine privilégié is clearly de lege ferenda,76 it results from state practice that some governments might actually be sympathetic, for example, to the protection of main economic interests through the principle of non-intervention.77 world/national-security/russian-military-was-behind-notpetya-cyberattack-in-ukraine-cia-concludes/2018/01/12/048d8506-f7ca-11e7-b34a-b85626af34ef_story.html&gt; accessed 9 May 2020.\n\nReviving the Principle of Non-Intervention in Cyberspace 439 # 4. A reconceptualisation of coercion In this section, I will first explain the traditional definition of the concept of coercion, and why it is unsatisfactory in the digital era (Subsection 4A). I then put forward my own reappraisal of the concept of coercion (Subsection 4B).\n## A. The traditional definition of coercion Coercion must be equated with the implementation of ‘coercive measures’ or ‘coercive methods’ and must be distinguished from the mere influence or persuasion.⁷⁸ In fact, Vattel described interference as an ‘attempt to put a constraint on [the] deliberations’ of another state,⁷⁹ whereas Kant put down that ‘[n]o State shall by force interfere with the constitution or government of another State’.⁸⁰ The Montevideo Convention on the Rights and Duties of States of 1933 established a duty of non-recognition of situations ‘obtained by force whether this consist[ed] in the employment of arms, in threatening diplomatic representations, or in any other effective coercive measures’.⁸¹ The Charter of the Organization of American States (OAS) prevented states from ‘us[ing] or encouraging[ing] the use of coercive measures of an economic or political character in order to force the sovereign will of another state and obtain from it advantages of any kind’.⁸² It also underlined that ‘[n]o territorial acquisitions or special advantages obtained either by force or by other means of coercion shall be recognized’.⁸³ In the Nicaragua case, the ICJ used the term ‘methods of coercion’.⁸⁴ Another question that arises is whether intention is necessary. An analysis of the ICJ case law confirms that intention must be taken into account.⁸⁵ Assemblée Nationale (France), ‘Première Séance Du Lundi 13 Avril 2015’ (13 April 2015) <www.assemblee-nationale.fr 14=\"\"14-cri=\"\"2014-2015=\"\"20150212.asp#p511027=\"\"> accessed 13 February 2020.

For a contrary view, see:</http:></www.assemblee-nationale.fr></www.assemblee-nationale.fr> Thibault Moulin However, the sole intention to secure change or to put pressure—in contrast with, for instance, the intention to overthrow a government—is sufficient. As the Court noted in the Nicaragua case:... in international law, if one State, with a view to the coercion of another State, supports and assists armed bands in that State whose purpose is to overthrow the government of that State, that amounts to an intervention by the one State in the internal affairs of the other, whether or not the political objective of the State giving such support and assistance is equally far-reaching.⁸⁶ In fact, the Court did not find it necessary ‘to seek to establish whether the intention of the United States to secure a change of governmental policies in Nicaragua went so far as to be equated with an endeavour to overthrow the Nicaraguan Government’.⁸⁷ This criterion was not challenged by the judgment pertaining to the Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo.⁸⁸ It is true that the Court found that non-intervention was violated ‘even if the objectives of Uganda were not to overthrow President Kabila’, and were intended ‘to securing towns and airports for reason of its perceived security needs, and in support of the parallel activity of those engaged in civil war’.⁸⁹ Yet, this position may be explained by the fact that a prohibited use of force was also found.⁹⁰ In its traditional sense, coercion thus occurs when a state deploys those means of pressure against another state, which are of a sufficiently serious nature to, and with the intention to, compel the latter to act in a certain way—or to refrain from acting in a certain way—and against its own will.⁹¹ Coercion is not a result- S Watts, ‘Low-intensity Cyber Operations and the Principle of Non-intervention’ in JD Ohlin, K Govern and C Finkelstein (eds), *Cyber War: Law and Ethics for Virtual Conflicts* 268.\n⁸⁶ Nicaragua (n 1) para 241. ‘With a view to the coercion’ was translated in the French version into ‘exercer une pression’ (ie ‘put pressure’).\n⁸⁷ ibid.

For instance, the ICJ concluded in the Nicaragua case that the principle of non-intervention was breached by the USA even if the attempt at securing political change failed.⁹² This understanding of coercion sets a high threshold and most cyber operations do not pass this test.⁹³ If a state was demanding another one to declare the wrong candidate a winner of the elections, or to declare the favourite candidate ineligible on false grounds, under the threat of launching a debilitating wave of cyberattacks, then the criterion of coercion would be met. Yet, it constitutes a textbook case which will rarely (if ever) happen in practice. In practice, democracy, freedom of expression or the proper functioning of infrastructures (among others) are hindered without a need for ‘compelling’ a state through the deployment of ‘coercive methods’. If Russia’s objective was to help Trump in the case of the DNC,⁹⁴ voters or the government were not ‘coerced’ stricto sensu. The former were given stolen information and fake news to persuade them to vote for Donald Trump—or ‘not vote at all’.⁹⁵ Then, state-sponsored attacks often take the form of ‘cyber-vandalism’ and would not pass the coercion test either. Let us take two actual examples of attacks against press organs. In April 2015, the French television network TV5Monde was the victim of a cyberattack directed by the so-called ‘CyberCaliphate’, who claimed to belong to the Islamic State.⁹⁶ The distribution of programmes was interrupted for hours.⁹⁷ Two months later, investigations revealed that the attack was more likely sponsored by Moscow and may constitute nothing more than an act of retaliation in reaction to the French and European measures adopted against Pellet, Droit International Public 1025–26; Government (the Netherlands) (n 11).\n⁹² Nicaragua (n 1) para 292(3).\n⁹³ The USA, through the voice of Brian Egan, acknowledged that non-intervention was ‘generally viewed as a relatively narrow rule of customary international law …’.

This may appear, from a certain perspective, as highly unsatisfactory, and it reveals that the concept of ‘coercion’ is in need of a reappraisal, to fit the new peculiarities of cyberattacks.¹⁰⁵ ## B. The reappraisal of coercion As mentioned above, ‘coercion’ historically occurs ‘when a State deploys those means of pressure against another State, that are of a sufficiently serious nature to, and with the intention to, compel the latter to act in a certain way – or to refrain from acting in a certain way – and against its own will’. Yet, this definition is unsatisfactory in the cyber realm and fails to grasp new types of highly disruptive cyberattacks.¹⁰⁶ Any reappraisal of the coercion is a risky exercise, though, and we must beware of excessively watering down this concept, at the risk of hindering basic interstate relations.\nIn particular, the distinction between plain ‘influence’ and constraint must be maintained.¹⁰⁷ It is likely that states will use the information they obtained through cyberespionage operations to influence the negotiation strategies and decision-making of other states, in line with their own interests.¹⁰⁸ It is also likely that states that suffered cyberattacks or acts of cyberespionage will adapt their internal and external policies, either for the purpose of repairing the damage or for preventing further strikes. For instance, after the revelations on mass surveillance of the National Security Agency (NSA), Germany did not want to depend on US technologies anymore and decided to create a new agency to ¹⁰⁵ The principle of due diligence might however be relevant to address those situations.

This is true both of the digital and physical domains.¹¹¹ As once underlined by Switzerland, there is—and I think there must be—a ‘limit between the lawful influence and the unlawful constraint’.¹¹² It was previously argued that two elements must usually be taken into consideration to make sure that coercion occurred: (i) the resort to means of a sufficiently serious nature; and (ii) the intention of the author. In cyberspace, however, it is usually an analysis of the method used (a malware) that helps cybersecurity experts to determine the prima facie intention of the author. Then, and as previously underlined, most cyber operations do not aim at ¹⁰⁹ A Shalal, ‘Germany, Seeking Independence from U.S., Pushes Cyber Security Research’ Reuters (29 August 2018) <www.reuters.com 9=\"\"article=\"\"germany-seeking-independence-from-u-s-pushes-cyber-security-research-idUSKCN1LE1FX=\"\"us-germany-cyber=\"\"> accessed 9 May 2020.\n¹¹⁰ For contradictory views, see: C Lotrione, ‘Countering State-Sponsored Cyber Economic Espionage under International Law’ (2014–2015) 40 North Carolina Journal of International Law and Commercial Regulation 443, 502; C Parajon-Skinner, ‘An International Law Response to Economic Cyber Espionage’ (2014) 46(4) Connecticut Law Review 1105, 1189–90; Schmitt (n 16) 320.\n¹¹¹ Let us imagine that ‘State A’ and ‘State B’ are both competing for selling jet-fighters to ‘State C’. State A makes a $85 million offer, whereas State B makes a $83 million offer. State A finally wins the contract, after making another offer: $82 million. State A was indeed obliged—due to the lower price proposed by State B—to change its position. Then, let us imagine that the companies based in ‘State D’ manufacture cars and sell them in large quantities abroad. A few years later, companies in ‘State E’ start manufacturing cars to a lower price, and the car industry collapses in State D, prompting the latter in renewing its economic or tax policies. State D indeed had—due to the economic emergence of State E—to review its policies. Let us take a third and last example. State F is a developing country that depends on foreign aid to fund the police. Following a wave of protest, the police in State F fires teargas and rubber bullets on demonstrators. State G—which is a donor—is shocked and decides to halt some aid. To remedy this situation, State F decides to cut education funding. In fact, State G prompted State F into changing its policies. If we equate ‘coercion’ with ‘influence’, these classical situations might result in prohibited interventions—and generate countermeasures in return.

They deprive actors of control and render them powerless instead.¹¹³ With election meddling, citizens are deprived of the possibility of expressing themselves democratically.¹¹⁴ For instance, the goal of the hack-and-leak operation that targeted the DNC was to reshape the public opinion and ‘represent[ed] the most recent expression of Moscow’s longstanding desire to undermine the US-led liberal democratic order’.¹¹⁵ Attacks directed at the media industry deprive organs of the possibility to express themselves and deprive citizens of the right to information. NotPetya attacks deprived Ukraine of the possibility to control financial transactions and the radioactivity level at the Chernobyl plant. It is thus necessary, for a reappraisal of coercion, to take those particularities into account. In a digital context, coercion may then be conceptualised as ‘a deprivation of control (1), resulting from the deliberate action of another State, as evidenced prima facie by the characteristics of the malware used (2)’. In my opinion, neither the ability of the targeted actor to prevent the attacks nor its ¹¹³ Some definitions move in that direction. For instance, the Australian government suggests: ‘[a] prohibited intervention is one that interferes by coercive means (in the sense that they effectively deprive another state of the ability to control, decide upon or govern matters of an inherently sovereign nature) …’. See: Government (Australia) (n 11). I first read it in Harriet Moynihan’s paper, where this definition is discussed: H Moynihan, ‘The Application of International Law to State Cyberattacks’ (Chatham House, 2019) 40–43 <www.chathamhouse.org default=\"\"files=\"\"files/publications=\"\"research=\"\"sites=\"\"research/2019-11-29-intl-law-cyberattacks.pdf=\"\"> accessed 6 February 2020. Robert Jennings and Arthur Watts also suggested: ‘to constitute intervention, the interference must be forcible or dictatorial, or otherwise coercive, in effect depriving the state intervened against of control over the matter in question’. See: Jennings and Watts (n 16) 432.\n¹¹⁴ Tampering with the electoral results has been described as prohibited interventions by some states, including Australia, Switzerland, the UK and the USA. See: Caflisch (n 11) 105; Attorney General’s Office and Jeremy Wright (UK) (n 8); Egan, ‘Remarks on International Law and Stability in Cyberspace’ (n 11); Government (Australia) (n 11). Describing ballot stuffing in terms of prohibited intervention is however not a new idea. In the 1980s, the US Congress highlighted that ‘[u]nilateral intervention in the internal affairs of other nations is antithetical to democracy. It contravenes international treaties and norms that are vital to the long-term peace and security of all nations in the Hemisphere. Intervention violates the right of self-determination which is the underpinning of every democracy.’ See: United States Congress House Committee on Appropriations Subcommittee on Foreign Operations and Related Agencies Appropriations, Foreign Assistance and Related Programs Appropriations for 1985: Hearings Before a Subcommittee of the Committee on Appropriations, House of Representatives, Ninety-Eighth Congress, Second Session (US Government Printing Office 1984) 662. Experts now suggest that doxfare might be at odd with self-determination, but clearly disagree as to whether it also constitutes a prohibited intervention. See: JD Ohlin, ‘Election Interference: The Real Harm and the Only Solution’ (2018) Cornell Law School Research Paper No 18-50, 8, 26 <http: 14=\"\"2020;=\"\"abstract=\"3276940\"sbstract=\"3276940\"ssrn.com=\"\"> accessed 14 December 2020; Tsagourias (n 38) 14, 15.\n¹¹⁵ Directorate of National Intelligence (the USA), ‘Background to “Assessing Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent US Elections”: The Analytic Process and Cyber Incident Attribution’ (6 January 2017) ii <www.dni.gov 01.pdf=\"\"documents=\"\"files=\"\"ICA_2017_0=\"\"> accessed 26 March 2020.</www.dni.gov></http:></www.chathamhouse.org> Thibault Moulin ability to fight them should be taken into consideration. It means that a prohibited intervention occurs as soon as these two conditions are met, even if the victim failed to equip itself with state-of-the-art protections, or reacted too late—for instance, due to technical or bureaucratic reasons. In the case of NotPetya, hackers exploited the vulnerabilities of older versions of Windows, for which corrective patches were nonetheless available.¹¹⁶ In the case of the OPM, 'persistent deficiencies' in the IT security programme had been reported before the data breach and were probably not fixed when it happened.¹¹⁷ Yet, these deficiencies do not alter the seriousness of the attacks: a deliberate deprivation of control still occurs.\nIt is finally appropriate to touch on the issue of economic cyberespionage. Under the framework put forward in this article, it is clear that only the most severe forms of intellectual property theft (if there are any) would qualify as prohibited interventions—those prone to threatening the economic stability of a state. If this phenomenon is indeed problematic and calls—in my opinion—for legal answers, tailor-made rules are required. In that sense, the Paris Call is interesting, as signatories pledged to '[p]revent ICT-enabled theft of intellectual property, including trade secrets or other confidential business information, with the intent of providing competitive advantages to companies or commercial sector'.¹¹⁸ # 5. Conclusion In this article, I championed the applicability of non-intervention in cyberspace. In my view, such applicability is welcomed by the international community and does not raise theoretical questions about the nature of sovereignty or the militarisation of cyberspace. However, I expressed fears that this principle becomes obsolete if we keep equating 'matters in which each State is permitted, by the principle of State sovereignty, to decide freely'¹¹⁹ with the notion of domaine réservé. I thus recommended that, for the purpose of non-intervention, we ought to adopt the notion of state domaine privilégié. The latter encompasses the political organisation of a state, its internal and external security, major economic interests and public services (including the health and social systems), as well as the preservation of a state's environment. Then, I turned to the concept of coercion, arguing in favour of a 'balanced' reinterpretation of coercion—ie a ¹¹⁶ 'What Is Petya and NotPetya Ransomware' (McAfee) <www.mcafee.com enterprise=\"\"fr-fr=\"\"security-awareness=\"\"ransomware=\"\"petya.html=\"\"> accessed 12 May 2020.\n¹¹⁷ OPM (the USA), 'Semi-Annual Report to Congress' (2015) <www.opm.gov for=\"\"reports-publications=\"\"semi-annual-reports=\"\"sar52.pdf=\"\"www.opm.gov=\"\"> accessed 12 May 2020; D Auerbach, 'The OPM Breach Is a Catastrophe' Slate (16 June 2015) <https: 06=\"\"2015=\"\"slate.com=\"\"opm-hack-its-a-catastrophe-heres-how-the-government-can-stop-the-next-one.html=\"\"technology=\"\"> accessed 12 May 2020.\n¹¹⁸ 'Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace' (n 8).\n¹¹⁹ Nicaragua (n 1) para 205.</https:></www.opm.gov></www.opm.gov> Reviving the Principle of Non-Intervention in Cyberspace 447 reconceptualisation that takes into account situations where states or non-state actors are deprived of control, but does not go as far as equating coercion with influence. This would indeed totally hinder international relations. In the end, it may be argued that a prohibited intervention occurs whenever a state (or a non-state actor located in that state) is deprived of control over matters within the domaine privilégié, due to the deliberate action of another state (as evidenced prima facie by the characteristics of the malware used). Yet, any cyber activity emanating from a state that prompts a given reaction in another state should not automatically be viewed as a prohibited intervention. After all—and as well illustrated by Denmark—‘[a]s hacker groups continuously perfect their technical skills and capabilities, state institutions will be forced to heighten their security levels and are thus engaged in a constant cyber-race.’¹²⁰ ¹²⁰ Centre for Cybersecurity (Denmark), ‘The Cyber Threat Against Denmark’ (2016) 4 <https: cfcs=\"\"cfcsdocuments=\"\"cfcsdocuments=\"\"threat%20assessment%20-%20the%20cyber%20threat%20against%20denmark.pdf=\"\"fe-ddis.dk=\"\"> accessed 29 February 2020.</https:> Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jcsl/article/25/3/423/5879500 by Eastman Dental Institute user on 03 July 2025"

    "abstract": "The applicability of existing rules of international law (namely sovereignty or the prohibition to use force) is currently challenged in cyberspace. In contrast, the relevance of the non-intervention principle is accepted by states and raises less questions about the ‘territoriality’ or the ‘militarization’ of cyberspace. At first sight, it thus appears as a convenient source for the regulation of cyberthreats. However, the Nicaragua case also established a stringent test for a foreign interference to qualify as an unlawful intervention. First, it must bear ‘on matters in which each State is permitted, by the principle of State sovereignty to decide freely’ (ie the ‘domaine réservé’). Then, it must involve ‘methods of coercion in regard to such choices’. I contend that both criteria are maladjusted to address cyberthreats and must be reconceptualised. In fact, the domaine réservé describes domains where states are free from international rules. However, few domains, including electoral processes or main economic orientations, are totally isolated from international law. I thus argue that it must be reconceptualised into the so-called ‘domaine privilégié’. It consists of a domain with clear-cut contours, unaffected by the developments of international law, which encompasses the fundamental interests of a state and its population. Then, coercion describes situations where a state is compelled to act, or to refrain from acting, in a certain fashion. This traditional approach is also problematic, and I argue that coercion must be understood in terms of deprivation of control.",
