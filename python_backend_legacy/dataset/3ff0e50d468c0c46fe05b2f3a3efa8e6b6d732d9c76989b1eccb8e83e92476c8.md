Over the past few years, however, perpetrators and defenders have publicly acknowledged their involvement in OCOs. How common is this strategic choice among states? What are its characteristics? In this research note I show that this is not a binary choice, and that there is variance in the strategies available to either side. I then examine what state behavior patterns can be identified by using compiled data of OCOs between 1996 and 2019. I show that this phenomenon of giving up secrecy is occurring and point out on states' characteristics and probabilities of choosing each strategy. Initial findings show significant use of public strategies by perpetrators (20 percent) and more so by defenders (50 percent), and that democracies tend toward public credit claiming and attribution, while less democratic countries tend toward public denial. As governments increasingly engage in OCOs, the implications of this research note are of interest to scholars and practitioners alike.\n## Resumen\nDe manera histórica, se ha considerado a las operaciones cibernéticas ofensivas (OCO) como una práctica que los Estados podrían llevar a cabo de manera encubierta, lejos del ojo público, y en la que tanto los perpetradores como los defensores tendrían incentivos para permanecer en silencio. Sin embargo, durante los últimos años han existido tanto perpetradores como defensores que han reconocido públicamente su participación en OCO. ¿Cómo de común es esta elección estratégica entre los Estados? ¿Cuáles son sus características? Demostramos que esta no es una elección binaria, y que existen variaciones en materia de las estrategias disponibles para ambas partes. A continuación, examinamos, mediante el uso de datos recopilados de OCO que tuvieron lugar entre 1996 y 2019, qué patrones de comportamiento por parte de los Estados se pueden identificar. Demostramos que este fenómeno, consistente en renunciar al carácter secreto de las OCO, está teniendo lugar y señalamos tanto las características como las probabilidades de los Estados de elegir cada estrategia. Los hallazgos iniciales muestran un uso significativo de estrategias de carácter público por parte de los perpetradores (20 percent) que es aún mayor por parte de los defensores (50 percent). Los hallazgos iniciales también demuestran que las democracias tienden a autoinculparse de manera pública y a atribuirse a sí mismas la autoría de las OCO, mientras que los países menos democráticos tienden a la negación pública. Debido a que los gobiernos se involucran cada vez más en las OCO, las implicaciones de esta nota de investigación resultan de interés tanto para académicos como para profesionales.\nBaram, Gil (2023) Public Secrets: The Dynamics of Publicity and Secrecy in Offensive Cyber Operations.

Cependant, ces dernières années, tant les responsables que les victimes ont reconnu publiquement leur implication dans des COO. Ce choix stratégique est-il commun chez les États? Quelles en sont les caractéristiques? Je montre qu'il ne s'agit pas d'un choix binaire et qu'il existe différentes stratégies possibles de chaque côté. Ensuite, je m'intéresse aux schémas comportementaux des États que l'on peut identifier à l'aide de données compilées sur des COO entre 1996 et 2019. Je montre qu'abandonner le secret est un phénomène qui existe tout en indiquant les caractéristiques des États et leurs probabilités de choisir chaque stratégie. Les premiers résultats révèlent une utilisation importante des stratégies publiques par les auteurs (20 percent), et encore plus importante par les victimes (50 percent). Ils indiquent aussi que les démocraties favorisent la réclamation et l'attribution publiques de la responsabilité, tandis que les pays moins démocratiques ont tendance à nier publiquement. Comme les gouvernements prennent de plus en plus part à des COO, les implications de cette note de recherche peuvent intéresser autant les chercheurs que les professionnels.\nKeywords: covert actions, cyberattacks, offensive cyber operations\nPalabras clave: acciones encubiertas, ciberataques, operaciones cibernéticas ofensivas\nMots clés: actions secrètes, cyberattaques, cyberopérations offensives\n# Introduction\nIn July 2020, in a rare public statement of that sort, US President Donald Trump took credit for an offensive cyber operation (OCO) against Russia's Internet Research Agency in St. Petersburg 2 years earlier. This was the first time an American president took credit for an OCO against another nation (Sanger 2020). Is this case of publicly claiming credit for an OCO an exception?\nScholarship suggests that perpetrators and defenders have incentives to keep their OCOs covert and that they might benefit from the advantages of deception (Gartzke and Lindsay 2015; Brantly 2016; Rovner 2021). Yet, the cases where they do decide to go public justify a deeper examination as OCOs are being publicly revealed, discussed, and acknowledged by perpetrators and defenders alike in the past years.\nIn this research note, I show that the decision governments face is not a binary political choice between concealing or revealing the OCO that they were involved in. Rather there is variance in the available strategies,\n1 I use the term offensive cyber operations as it includes espionage and information theft, as well as cyber-enabled information operations, that did not cause physical damage (also known as computer network exploitation [CNE] and computer network influence [CN1] in the technical language).\nranging from complete silence to credit claiming for the perpetrator and from complete silence to public attribution for the defender. In this systematic analysis of both sides, I use data to show that this variance exists and how selected characteristics of the defender and perpetrator and of the OCOs themselves correlate with decision to conceal or disclose the operation.\nThis paper proceeds as follows. The first part discusses the role of secrecy and publicity in OCOs and the evolving relationship between the two. It points out on the possible strategies of each side and the variance within them. The second presents the variance in the strategies according to the data and the results of the multinomial regressions examining the variables affecting the chances of both the perpetrator and the defender to choose public strategy over secrecy. The final part discusses the initial findings and their contribution to the understanding of the role of secrecy in OCOs within the broader disciplines of international relations and canvasses future application and research avenues.\nThe nature of OCOs is such that they cannot be fully observed, since an unknown number of them are not revealed. These are the so-called unknown-unknowns, or non-observation cyberattacks and intrusions (Egloff 2020a). These are OCOs assumed to have taken place but not reported and therefore not recorded in the open data sources we used. All cyber-related research trying\nGIL BARAM\nto empirically examine OCOs encounters a form of this problem. For the purposes of this paper, only OCOs that have been publicly revealed and for which there exist sufficient data to code were included (see Online Appendix 1 for details).\n## Secrecy and Publicity in Offensive Cyber Operations\nHistorically, OCOs were considered inherently secret: as General Michael Hayden, former director of the National Security Agency (NSA) and Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), highlighted the degree of secrecy surrounding OCOs: “Even the phrase ‘offensive cyber operations’ was classified. Not what it might mean, or what the targets might be, or what technologies would be involved—merely the phrase itself” (Lin and Zegart 2019, 5).\nThe covertness of OCOs is two-fold, pertaining to both action and actor. First, the OCOs themselves can be kept covert. Unlike kinetic means, some of the technological characteristics of OCOs enable perpetrators to obscure the way in which they were carried out and conceal them from both the defender and the public at large. The second aspect regards the perpetrators, who can conceal their identity and maintain covertness.²\nRecent research discussed the importance of deception in the cyber domain and the challenges it creates for states to distinguish between espionage activities in cyberspace and OCOs (Gartzke and Lindsay 2015; Brantly 2016). Furthermore, it suggests that actors can gain unprecedented strategic advantages in conflict short of war by leveraging the scale, speed, and anonymity of cyberspace (Kello 2017; Buchanan 2020; Maschmeyer 2022).\nOther scholars offer to characterize OCOs as an intelligence contest, with the aim of gaining an advantage in information acquisition. In this context, successful execution of OCOs necessitates limiting the other side’s access to information. National intelligence services are keenly aware of their own susceptibility to espionage and consequently engage in counterintelligence practices to safeguard their digital information (see Chesney and Smeets 2020; Rovner 2021).\nVarious explanations pointed out on the benefits of the use of covert action, ranging from preventing escalation to the ability to signal in secret. These lead to the expectation that countries might prefer to maintain ambiguity or secrecy rather than making a public responses (Lindsay 2015; Carson 2016; Green and Long 2020; Haas and Yarhi-Milo 2021). In addition, secrecy enables leaders to minimize domestic political repercussions, such as facing public backlash for provoking a crisis that may result in an undesirable escalation or for stepping back from a crisis to avoid one (Fearon 1994; Kurizaki 2007).\nAn option of partial concealment exists when full concealment is not possible, such as when an OCO has been revealed by the perpetrator or a third party (Romanosky and Boudreaux 2020), or when the damage caused cannot be concealed. In this case, the defender does not want to admit that an attack has taken place but must acknowledge visible damage, and therefore attributes it to a technical malfunction. Examining this option empirically is difficult, since the defender does not reveal that an attack did in fact occur (Baram and Sommer 2019).\nThere are also some public options for both the perpetrator and the defender. A standing element of covert action is plausible deniability, which can offer the perpetrator an advantage especially when the covert action is a cyberattack. Deniability allows countries to act in the “gray area” without exacerbating the conflict, although it is often clear to domestic and international audiences that covert action has been taken (Cormac and Aldrich 2018; Aldrich and Moran 2019; Poznansky 2020).\nEven when the perpetrator publicly denies involvement, it may or may not have actually carried out the attack attributed to it. Therefore, the key question is if public denial is not perceived as credible, why should states choose this option? This question is further complicated when it comes to OCOs, an arena even more secretive than traditional covert warfare. Therefore, switching to the public option—even if it is a denial and not a public credit claiming—requires an explanation, and literature identifies several (Poznansky 2020). This study identifies the option of public denial as one of the public strategies available to the perpetrator, and examines the possible circumstances in which this strategy might be chosen.\nAnother important aspect of OCOs is attribution, recognized as one of the most difficult problems in the cyber world (Gartzke 2013; Kello 2013; Liff 2013; Rid and Buchanan 2015; Eichensehr 2020; Steffens 2020). Attribution is defined as “determining the identity or location of the perpetrator” (Wheeler and Larsen 2003, 1). The\n² It is important to distinguish between clandestine and covert operations in this context. A covert operation is one that is conducted without the local population and enemy forces being aware of its existence. Clandestine operations are secret operations that are carried out in a manner that conceals the identity of the operator. In Lindsay’s view (Lindsay 2015), the “perfect” covert action would hide both the harm and the person who committed it.\nThe Dynamics of Publicity and Secrecy in Offensive Cyber Operations\nTable 1. Perpetrator and defender's strategies\n|   | Option #1 | Option #2 | Option #3 | Option #4  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  Perpetrator strategy | Full concealment | Public denial | Public credit claiming |   |\n|  Defender strategy | Full concealment | Partial concealment | Publicizing without attribution | Publicizing with public attribution  |\nattribution process involves different aspects, including technical, political, legal, strategic and other components (Lin 2016). There are various techniques for carrying out a process of attributing an OCO, and it often requires a considerable investment of different kinds of resources (Broeders, De Busser, and Pawlak 2020).\nIn the past few years, it seems that state-sponsored OCOs are being publicly attributed to specific state actors and this trend is being discussed theoretically (Egloff 2020b, 2020a). Although this significant development helps position public attribution as a research issue in itself, most studies in the field do not deal with the dynamics between the perpetrator and defender (for exceptions, see Edwards et al. 2017; Schulzke 2018; Baram 2023). It is important to mention that defenders could decide to reveal the fact that they have suffered a cyberattack or intrusion without attributing it to a specific perpetrator.\nRecent discussion regarding voluntary attribution by cyber perpetrators, also described as public credit claiming, maintained that although secrecy is an essential feature of OCOs, some actors choose to publicly claim credit for OCOs they have committed; specifically, this phenomenon is examined among non-state actors (Poznansky and Perkoski 2018).\nThe way in which states perceive and understand risk and uncertainty in cyberspace varies significantly, resulting in a less-than-ideal status quo that contributes to heightened levels of risk and uncertainty (Brantly 2021, 2). When either sides need to decide whether to go public or not, there is a degree of uncertainty: the aggressor is not sure how well its operation has gone. The defender is not quite sure (1) if it has encountered a cyberattack or a technical glitch and (2) how far it has been compromised. These are \"hidden\" possibilities, and therefore hard to study but still worth mentioning.\nBased on this literature, I categorize the following strategies: the perpetrator can chose from (1) full concealment; (2) public denial; and (3) public credit claiming. The defender can chose from (1) full concealment; (2) partial concealment—disclosing damage but denying that it was caused by a deliberate attack (claiming technical malfunctions, system glitches etc.); (3) publicizing the\nOCO without attribution—publicly disclosing that an OCO took place but refraining from publicly identifying the perpetrator; and (4) publicizing the OCO with public attribution—both publicly disclosing that an OCO occurred and publicly attributing it to a specific perpetrator. Table 1 summarizes these strategies. $^3$\nAlthough exposing the OCO and attributing it to a perpetrator might damage the defender's image, this also seems to carry certain benefits as well. As the primary objective of this study was to examine the relationship between states' characteristics and their chosen strategies during cyber conflict, several additional variables are required to be taken into account that are associated with the OCOs themselves: the target that was attacked, the method used, whether a third party was involved, and the severity of the damage caused.\n## Empirical Analysis\nThis section is divided into three parts. First, I discuss the perpetrator and the defender identity and the main countries involved in cyber conflict according to the data. Second, I show variance in the dependent variables, perpetrator strategy and defender strategy, and discuss its meaning and significance. Third, I examine the independent variables—selected factors that might affect perpetrators and defenders' chances for choosing publicity over secrecy.\nMultinomial logistic regression analyses were conducted in order to compare all possible strategies of the perpetrator and the defender, on the assumption that decision-makers consider all available options before choosing, at least at the beginning of the process.\n3 This variance is wider than only these strategies. Some examples can include sharing information on the attack among elites or with allies, but not with the public; the timing of publicity might change and affect the perpetrator calculations. See Brown and Fazal (2021) on non-denial denials and other kind of \"hidden\" strategies. In addition, it is important to mention the OCOs that would not be detected by the defenders and that the attacker would not report on. As a result, they will not appear in the data.\nGIL BARAM\n5\nFigure 1. The identity of the perpetrators and the number of OCOs they carried out 1996–2019.\nFigure 2. The identity of the defenders and the number of OCOs they experienced in 1996–2019.\n# Actors Identity\nPerpetrators identity—figure 1 shows the main attacking countries and the number of OCOs they carried out in the years 1996–2019. The countries that carried out the most OCOs were China (157), Russia (127), Iran (60), North Korea (34), and the United States (32). Non-democratic countries are at the top of the list, but democratic countries—including the United States, Israel, and South Korea—have also carried out OCOs on a significant scale. All the attackers were states, except for cases where the identity of the attacker was unknown (22 cases—4.7 percent of all attacks).\nDefenders identity—figure 2 shows the sixteen most attacked countries and the number of OCOs they experienced in the years 1996–2019. The main defenders were the United States (140), South Korea (26), Ukraine (23), Japan (21), and India (18). Democratic countries seem to be at the top of the list, but non-democratic countries, such as Iran and China, have also experienced many cyberattacks and intrusions as well.⁴\n# Perpetrator Strategies\nThe perpetrator can choose between three possible strategies: maintaining silence, public denial, or claiming credit. Figure 3 illustrates the variance in strategy chosen by attacking countries. In most cases—374, or 78.6 percent—the perpetrators maintained silence. Public denial was chosen in seventy-one cases (15 percent), and\n4 These data show the prominence of the United States in the context of OCOs, as well as the over-reporting of English resources. This is a known issue in the datasets that this paper is based on and they acknowledge this issue (see Online Appendix 1 for the data compilation procedures). In spite of this, this was the best available data at the time of the analysis, and the results should be interpreted accordingly.\nThe Dynamics of Publicity and Secrecy in Offensive Cyber Operations\nFigure 3. Perpetrator strategies.\nin thirty-one cases (6.5 percent) the perpetrators claimed full credit for the attack.\nWhile maintaining silence is the most prevalent strategy, attacking states chose a public strategy in more than 20 percent of cases. Although trailing far behind the most common choice of silence, at one in five OCOs, the prevalence of public strategies is not negligible.\nNow that the variance in perpetrators' strategies has been established, we can turn to test which independent variables affect each kind of strategy. The model described below includes the variables of the regime type, GDP per capita, and the percentage of military force out of the total labor force in the country. The other variables describe the characteristics of the OCO (see Online Appendixes 2 and 3).\n# The Perpetrator—Results of the Multinomial Regression\nOnce we established the variance in attackers' strategies—which includes a meaningful share of public actions—we now turn to test which independent variables affect each kind of strategy. In each model, a comparison is made between the chances that the perpetrator chooses any of the public strategies versus the chance that it would choose to maintain ambiguity.\nThe results in table 2 show that the following variables—regime type, $^{5}$  GDP per capita, method of the attack, and third-party involvement—have an effect on the chances that the perpetrator would choose to claim\n5 On the relationship between regime type and initiating cyber conflict, see Hunter et al. (2022).\ncredit for an attack or publicly deny it over choosing silence. For robustness, I used several model specifications (see Online Appendix 4).\nRegime type—among countries with a democratic regime, the chances of publicly claiming credit for an attack rather than maintaining silence are 11.8 times higher than countries that are nondemocracies.\nCountries with anocratic regimes are four times more likely to publicly deny their involvement in the attack than maintain silence compared to countries that are not anocracies.\nGDP per capita—perpetrators with a high GDP per capita ( $&gt;$ 8,000) are 2.8 times less likely to choose public denial over silence than countries with a lower GDP ( $p = 0.04$ ), and even less likely to choose public credit claiming, at 3.9 times less than countries with a lower GDP.\nThis finding warrants a note, as it is not consistent with the results of the other multinomial regressions that followed that show clearly that high GDP countries are in fact more likely to self-attribute and claim credit. This discrepancy is possibly the result of countries where there is a disparity between regime type and GDP and which manifests differently in each regression. This particular result for the GDP variable is an isolated occurrence that does not affect the overall findings (see Online Appendix 4).\nMethod of the attack—in cases where the attack method is considered sophisticated, chances of the perpetrator publicly claiming credit rather than maintaining silence are 7.8 times lower than in cases of less sophisticated attacks. It appears that perpetrators employing sophisticated methods would tend to maintain silence.\nGIL BARAM\n7\nTable 2.

Standard errors are given in parentheses.\n* p &lt; 0.05, ** p &lt; 0.01, Pearson &lt; 0.0001.\nThird-party involvement—when a third party is involved in the OCO, perpetrators are six times more likely to choose public denial than in cases that do not involve a third party.\nWe can see, therefore, that a country's level of democracy has an impact on its choice of strategy. Democracies generally tend to publicly claim credit, while less democratic states tend to choose public denial. When the method of the attack is sophisticated, the chance that the perpetrator exposes the attack and claim credit for it is very low compared to the chance that it maintains silence. When a third party is involved in executing the OCO, the chances of the perpetrator choosing public denial increase greatly (six times more).\n## Defender Strategies\nAfter detecting an OCO, the defender has four possible strategies: full concealment; partial concealment; revealing the attack without attribution; and revealing the attack with public attribution. As seen in figure 4, there is greater variance here than for the perpetrator. In 222 cases (46.6 percent), the defender chose to maintain silence and made no public reference to the attack. However, in 238 cases (50 percent), defenders chose a public strategy that revealed the attack; among them, 108 cases (22.7 percent) were revealed without attribution and 103 (27.3 percent) with public attribution. Of the three public options, partial concealment was the least chosen strategy, taken in only 16 cases (3.4 percent).\nThe Dynamics of Publicity and Secrecy in Offensive Cyber Operations\nTable 3.

Standard errors are given in parentheses.\n* p &lt; 0.05, ** p &lt; 0.01.\nIf so, then, the data show that maintaining silence is not always the common strategy for defenders. With exactly one-half of the cases showing that defenders chose one of the public strategies, it seems that at least as often as not, defenders have an interest in going public.\n## The Defender—Results of the Multinomial Regression\nThe results show in table 3 that the following variables—regime type, GDP per capita, method of the attack, its severity and third-party involvement—impact the chances of the defender choosing a public strategy, whether with or without attribution, rather than choosing silence.\nRegime type—countries with a democratic regime were 6.2 times more likely to both publicly reveal the attack and publicly attribute it to a specific perpetrator than nondemocracies.\nCountries categorized as anocracies were 4.9 times more likely to choose to publicly reveal both the attack and the perpetrator over maintain silence than countries with a different regime type.\nGDP per capita—defenders with a high GDP per capita (&gt;$8,000) were 3.5 times more likely to choose to publicly reveal both the attack and the perpetrator than countries with a lower GDP per capita, and 7 times more likely to reveal the attack without attributing it than countries with lower GDP per capita.\nMethod of the attack—countries attacked by more sophisticated methods were 7 times less likely to publicly reveal both the attack and the perpetrator than countries attacked by less sophisticated methods.\nSeverity—countries that suffered severe attacks causing a considerable degree of damage had a 3.2 higher chance of choosing to publicly reveal both the attack and the perpetrator over choosing silence compared to\nGIL BARAM\n9\nFigure 4. Defender strategies.\ncountries that suffered lower severity attacks (p = 0.006). Chances of them choosing partial concealment were even higher—7.3 times more likely than countries that suffered attacks with lower severity.\nThird-party involvement—when a third party was involved in the attack, the chances of the defender choosing to publicly reveal both the attack and the perpetrator over maintaining silence are 3.4 times higher than in cases not involving a third party.\n## Discussion and Conclusions\nSecrecy is a crucial aspect of OCOs. The use of covert cyber operations allows governments and militaries to achieve their objectives without having to resort to more overt forms of aggression or conflict. However, the secrecy surrounding these operations can also create challenges. For example, it may be difficult for the public to hold government or military actors accountable for their actions in cyberspace if the details of these operations are not transparent.\nThis research note points out the variance in state strategies when deciding how to react after an OCO has taken place and also points out some initial explanations. The main innovation of the study is in demonstrating that countries have an interest in choosing public strategies on OCOs, even though these may often be concealed. In certain cases, the defenders have an interest in exposing the OCOs and sometimes even exposing the perpetrator. Perpetrators sometimes refrain from complete silence and make some form of public comment—denial or credit claiming.\nThe research offers a systematic analysis of the range of strategies and the chances of choosing each. Using variables to quantify and qualify the characteristics of countries (e.g., regime type, economic and military power) and the OCOs (e.g., method, target, third-party involvement)\nhistorically involved in cyber conflict over the past two and a half decades allowed an intersectional analysis of which strategies were chosen by whom, and offered initial insights regarding under what conditions.\nThe findings show that the perpetrator's strategy has clear characteristics. While maintaining silence is the preferred strategy, in about one-fifth of the cases the perpetrator prefers to relinquish secrecy by publicly claiming credit or at least publicly denying. The frequency of public strategies is not negligible, and although they do not exceed the frequency of silence, it appears that the perpetrator is often interested in publicly addressing the attacks it has committed.\nWhen the perpetrator was a democracy, there was eleven to twelve times higher chance that it will choose to expose the OCO it has committed and claim credit to itself and not maintain silence. When the perpetrator was not a democracy, there was a four times higher chance that it will choose public denial and not maintain silence.\nIn the strategies of the defender, there is greater variance: in almost half of the cases (46.6 percent), the defender chose to remain silent and not address the OCO publicly. However, in the second half of the cases, it chose public strategies. Publicity is expressed in two ways: exposing the OCO without attribution to a particular perpetrator and exposing it with public attribution. A partial concealment strategy has only come up in less than 4 percent of cases. From the data, it can be seen that in many cases the defender chose to relinquish secrecy and reveal the fact that it was attacked. When the defender was a democracy, there is a five to six times higher chance that it will choose to expose the OCO and the perpetrator. In addition, when it had a high GDP, it is 3.5–4 times more likely to choose to expose the OCO and the perpetrator.\nIn terms of variables related to the OCO itself, it appears that the target type and the involvement of a third party had a significant impact on the likelihood of the\nThe Dynamics of Publicity and Secrecy in Offensive Cyber Operations\nperpetrator and the defender choosing public strategies. When a third party was involved in carrying out the OCO and when the targets were nonmilitary, the chances increased that countries would choose a public strategy.\nWhen it comes to public strategies, perpetrators with a low level of democracy had a higher chance of choosing public denial or silence, and those with a higher degree of democracy are more likely to self-attribute, that is, claim credit for the OCO. Defenders with a high level of democracy tend to expose the OCO more than nondemocracies.\nWhen it comes to the severity of the OCO, the results were significant for two of the three strategies available to the defender: partial concealment and fully exposing the OCOs with public attribution. Regarding the intermediate strategy of exposing the attack without attribution, the results obtained were not significant. Here, we must bear in mind that extensive damage is often visible and cannot easily be concealed, thereby forcing defenders to take some form of public strategy. But why these specific two of the three options? A possible explanation is that a defender will choose full exposure and public attribution when it can identify the perpetrator with high degree of certainty, and partial concealment, that is, claiming malfunction, when it cannot attribute the attack or does not want to. Therefore, it appears that in cases of obvious damage that cannot be concealed, the intermediate strategy of exposing the attack without exposing the perpetrator carries no significant advantages. Furthermore, when the OCO was carried out by using a more sophisticated method, both perpetrators and defenders had higher chances to remain silent.\nThis study provides initial insights regarding the importance of political characteristics of the countries on either side of OCOs, and in identifying previously unexplored patterns of political action. Moving forward, future research should consider several conditioning variables.\nFirst, how good are the defender's retaliatory options? If they can retaliate, are defenders more likely to publicize, whereas if they cannot retaliate, are they more likely to remain silent? Relatedly, the decision to publicize is conditioned by whether the public would know that something had happened. For example, the UK government could hardly deny that WannaCry (2017) had happened within the United Kingdom, given that most of the National Health System was affected.6\nSecond, is the decision to publicize conditioned by whether the OCO is exploited for kinetic targets or con\n6 On the public preferences regarding retaliation in and outside cyberspace, see Shandler, Gross, and Canetti (2021).\nfined wholly within cyberspace? Consider Israel's \"Operation Orchard\" (2007), in which Syrian air defenses were reportedly cyberattacked in order to buy time for a kinetic air raid.\nThird, when it comes to regime type distinction, future research should consider several issues: Is it that democracies are some of the most advanced cyber powers, such as the United States, Israel, the United Kingdom, that are driving the results? Alternatively, perhaps democracies are particularly assertive overseas, so the results are effectively showing their wider foreign policy.\n## Supplementary Information\nSupplementary information is available at the Journal of Global Security Studies\n## Acknowledgments\nThe author would like to thank Prof. Isaac Ben Israel, Prof. Udi Sommer and Prof. Yotam Margalit for their insightful comments on an earlier version of this project, and to Eden Poch, Dana Litman, Adi Lotan and Noya Peer for the excellent research assistance.

Over the past few years, however, perpetrators and defenders have publicly acknowledged their involvement in OCOs. How common is this strategic choice among states? What are its characteristics? In this research note I show that this is not a binary choice, and that there is variance in the strategies available to either side. I then examine what state behavior patterns can be identified by using compiled data of OCOs between 1996 and 2019. I show that this phenomenon of giving up secrecy is occurring and point out on states' characteristics and probabilities of choosing each strategy. Initial findings show significant use of public strategies by perpetrators (20 percent) and more so by defenders (50 percent), and that democracies tend toward public credit claiming and attribution, while less democratic countries tend toward public denial. As governments increasingly engage in OCOs, the implications of this research note are of interest to scholars and practitioners alike.\n## Resumen De manera histórica, se ha considerado a las operaciones cibernéticas ofensivas (OCO) como una práctica que los Estados podrían llevar a cabo de manera encubierta, lejos del ojo público, y en la que tanto los perpetradores como los defensores tendrían incentivos para permanecer en silencio. Sin embargo, durante los últimos años han existido tanto perpetradores como defensores que han reconocido públicamente su participación en OCO. ¿Cómo de común es esta elección estratégica entre los Estados? ¿Cuáles son sus características? Demostramos que esta no es una elección binaria, y que existen variaciones en materia de las estrategias disponibles para ambas partes. A continuación, examinamos, mediante el uso de datos recopilados de OCO que tuvieron lugar entre 1996 y 2019, qué patrones de comportamiento por parte de los Estados se pueden identificar. Demostramos que este fenómeno, consistente en renunciar al carácter secreto de las OCO, está teniendo lugar y señalamos tanto las características como las probabilidades de los Estados de elegir cada estrategia. Los hallazgos iniciales muestran un uso significativo de estrategias de carácter público por parte de los perpetradores (20 percent) que es aún mayor por parte de los defensores (50 percent). Los hallazgos iniciales también demuestran que las democracias tienden a autoinculparse de manera pública y a atribuirse a sí mismas la autoría de las OCO, mientras que los países menos democráticos tienden a la negación pública. Debido a que los gobiernos se involucran cada vez más en las OCO, las implicaciones de esta nota de investigación resultan de interés tanto para académicos como para profesionales.\nBaram, Gil (2023) Public Secrets: The Dynamics of Publicity and Secrecy in Offensive Cyber Operations.

Cependant, ces dernières années, tant les responsables que les victimes ont reconnu publiquement leur implication dans des COO. Ce choix stratégique est-il commun chez les États? Quelles en sont les caractéristiques? Je montre qu'il ne s'agit pas d'un choix binaire et qu'il existe différentes stratégies possibles de chaque côté. Ensuite, je m'intéresse aux schémas comportementaux des États que l'on peut identifier à l'aide de données compilées sur des COO entre 1996 et 2019. Je montre qu'abandonner le secret est un phénomène qui existe tout en indiquant les caractéristiques des États et leurs probabilités de choisir chaque stratégie. Les premiers résultats révèlent une utilisation importante des stratégies publiques par les auteurs (20 percent), et encore plus importante par les victimes (50 percent). Ils indiquent aussi que les démocraties favorisent la réclamation et l'attribution publiques de la responsabilité, tandis que les pays moins démocratiques ont tendance à nier publiquement. Comme les gouvernements prennent de plus en plus part à des COO, les implications de cette note de recherche peuvent intéresser autant les chercheurs que les professionnels.\nKeywords: covert actions, cyberattacks, offensive cyber operations Palabras clave: acciones encubiertas, ciberataques, operaciones cibernéticas ofensivas Mots clés: actions secrètes, cyberattaques, cyberopérations offensives # Introduction In July 2020, in a rare public statement of that sort, US President Donald Trump took credit for an offensive cyber operation (OCO) against Russia's Internet Research Agency in St. Petersburg 2 years earlier. This was the first time an American president took credit for an OCO against another nation. Is this case of publicly claiming credit for an OCO an exception?\nScholarship suggests that perpetrators and defenders have incentives to keep their OCOs covert and that they might benefit from the advantages of deception. Yet, the cases where they do decide to go public justify a deeper examination as OCOs are being publicly revealed, discussed, and acknowledged by perpetrators and defenders alike in the past years.\nIn this research note, I show that the decision governments face is not a binary political choice between concealing or revealing the OCO that they were involved in. Rather there is variance in the available strategies,\n\nranging from complete silence to credit claiming for the perpetrator and from complete silence to public attribution for the defender. In this systematic analysis of both sides, I use data to show that this variance exists and how selected characteristics of the defender and perpetrator and of the OCOs themselves correlate with decision to conceal or disclose the operation.\nThis paper proceeds as follows. The first part discusses the role of secrecy and publicity in OCOs and the evolving relationship between the two. It points out on the possible strategies of each side and the variance within them. The second presents the variance in the strategies according to the data and the results of the multinomial regressions examining the variables affecting the chances of both the perpetrator and the defender to choose public strategy over secrecy. The final part discusses the initial findings and their contribution to the understanding of the role of secrecy in OCOs within the broader disciplines of international relations and canvasses future application and research avenues.\nThe nature of OCOs is such that they cannot be fully observed, since an unknown number of them are not revealed. These are the so-called unknown-unknowns, or non-observation cyberattacks and intrusions . These are OCOs assumed to have taken place but not reported and therefore not recorded in the open data sources we used. All cyber-related research trying\nGIL BARAM\nto empirically examine OCOs encounters a form of this problem. For the purposes of this paper, only OCOs that have been publicly revealed and for which there exist sufficient data to code were included (see Online Appendix 1 for details).\n## Secrecy and Publicity in Offensive Cyber Operations\nHistorically, OCOs were considered inherently secret: as General Michael Hayden, former director of the National Security Agency (NSA) and Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), highlighted the degree of secrecy surrounding OCOs: “Even the phrase ‘offensive cyber operations’ was classified. Not what it might mean, or what the targets might be, or what technologies would be involved—merely the phrase itself” .\nThe covertness of OCOs is two-fold, pertaining to both action and actor. First, the OCOs themselves can be kept covert. Unlike kinetic means, some of the technological characteristics of OCOs enable perpetrators to obscure the way in which they were carried out and conceal them from both the defender and the public at large. The second aspect regards the perpetrators, who can conceal their identity and maintain covertness.²\nRecent research discussed the importance of deception in the cyber domain and the challenges it creates for states to distinguish between espionage activities in cyberspace and OCOs . Furthermore, it suggests that actors can gain unprecedented strategic advantages in conflict short of war by leveraging the scale, speed, and anonymity of cyberspace .\nOther scholars offer to characterize OCOs as an intelligence contest, with the aim of gaining an advantage in information acquisition. In this context, successful execution of OCOs necessitates limiting the other side’s access to information. National intelligence services are keenly aware of their own susceptibility to espionage and consequently engage in counterintelligence practices to safeguard their digital information (see Chesney and Smeets 2020; Rovner 2021).\nVarious explanations pointed out on the benefits of the use of covert action, ranging from preventing escalation to the ability to signal in secret. These lead to the expectation that countries might prefer to maintain ambiguity or secrecy rather than making a public responses . In addition, secrecy enables leaders to minimize domestic political repercussions, such as facing public backlash for provoking a crisis that may result in an undesirable escalation or for stepping back from a crisis to avoid one .\nAn option of partial concealment exists when full concealment is not possible, such as when an OCO has been revealed by the perpetrator or a third party , or when the damage caused cannot be concealed. In this case, the defender does not want to admit that an attack has taken place but must acknowledge visible damage, and therefore attributes it to a technical malfunction. Examining this option empirically is difficult, since the defender does not reveal that an attack did in fact occur .\nThere are also some public options for both the perpetrator and the defender. A standing element of covert action is plausible deniability, which can offer the perpetrator an advantage especially when the covert action is a cyberattack. Deniability allows countries to act in the “gray area” without exacerbating the conflict, although it is often clear to domestic and international audiences that covert action has been taken .\nEven when the perpetrator publicly denies involvement, it may or may not have actually carried out the attack attributed to it. Therefore, the key question is if public denial is not perceived as credible, why should states choose this option? This question is further complicated when it comes to OCOs, an arena even more secretive than traditional covert warfare. Therefore, switching to the public option—even if it is a denial and not a public credit claiming—requires an explanation, and literature identifies several . This study identifies the option of public denial as one of the public strategies available to the perpetrator, and examines the possible circumstances in which this strategy might be chosen.\nAnother important aspect of OCOs is attribution, recognized as one of the most difficult problems in the cyber world . Attribution is defined as “determining the identity or location of the perpetrator” . The\n² It is important to distinguish between clandestine and covert operations in this context. A covert operation is one that is conducted without the local population and enemy forces being aware of its existence. Clandestine operations are secret operations that are carried out in a manner that conceals the identity of the operator. In Lindsay’s view , the “perfect” covert action would hide both the harm and the person who committed it.\nThe Dynamics of Publicity and Secrecy in Offensive Cyber Operations\nTable 1. Perpetrator and defender's strategies\n|   | Option #1 | Option #2 | Option #3 | Option #4  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  Perpetrator strategy | Full concealment | Public denial | Public credit claiming |   |\n|  Defender strategy | Full concealment | Partial concealment | Publicizing without attribution | Publicizing with public attribution  |\nattribution process involves different aspects, including technical, political, legal, strategic and other components . There are various techniques for carrying out a process of attributing an OCO, and it often requires a considerable investment of different kinds of resources (Broeders, De Busser, and Pawlak 2020).\nIn the past few years, it seems that state-sponsored OCOs are being publicly attributed to specific state actors and this trend is being discussed theoretically . Although this significant development helps position public attribution as a research issue in itself, most studies in the field do not deal with the dynamics between the perpetrator and defender (for exceptions, see Edwards et al. 2017; Schulzke 2018; Baram 2023). It is important to mention that defenders could decide to reveal the fact that they have suffered a cyberattack or intrusion without attributing it to a specific perpetrator.\nRecent discussion regarding voluntary attribution by cyber perpetrators, also described as public credit claiming, maintained that although secrecy is an essential feature of OCOs, some actors choose to publicly claim credit for OCOs they have committed; specifically, this phenomenon is examined among non-state actors .\nThe way in which states perceive and understand risk and uncertainty in cyberspace varies significantly, resulting in a less-than-ideal status quo that contributes to heightened levels of risk and uncertainty . When either sides need to decide whether to go public or not, there is a degree of uncertainty: the aggressor is not sure how well its operation has gone. The defender is not quite sure (1) if it has encountered a cyberattack or a technical glitch and (2) how far it has been compromised. These are \"hidden\" possibilities, and therefore hard to study but still worth mentioning.\nBased on this literature, I categorize the following strategies: the perpetrator can chose from (1) full concealment; (2) public denial; and (3) public credit claiming. The defender can chose from (1) full concealment; (2) partial concealment—disclosing damage but denying that it was caused by a deliberate attack (claiming technical malfunctions, system glitches etc.); (3) publicizing the\nOCO without attribution—publicly disclosing that an OCO took place but refraining from publicly identifying the perpetrator; and (4) publicizing the OCO with public attribution—both publicly disclosing that an OCO occurred and publicly attributing it to a specific perpetrator. Table 1 summarizes these strategies. $^3$\nAlthough exposing the OCO and attributing it to a perpetrator might damage the defender's image, this also seems to carry certain benefits as well. As the primary objective of this study was to examine the relationship between states' characteristics and their chosen strategies during cyber conflict, several additional variables are required to be taken into account that are associated with the OCOs themselves: the target that was attacked, the method used, whether a third party was involved, and the severity of the damage caused.\n## Empirical Analysis\nThis section is divided into three parts. First, I discuss the perpetrator and the defender identity and the main countries involved in cyber conflict according to the data. Second, I show variance in the dependent variables, perpetrator strategy and defender strategy, and discuss its meaning and significance. Third, I examine the independent variables—selected factors that might affect perpetrators and defenders' chances for choosing publicity over secrecy.\nMultinomial logistic regression analyses were conducted in order to compare all possible strategies of the perpetrator and the defender, on the assumption that decision-makers consider all available options before choosing, at least at the beginning of the process.\n\nGIL BARAM\n\nFigure 2. The identity of the defenders and the number of OCOs they experienced in 1996–2019.\n# Actors Identity\nPerpetrators identity—figure 1 shows the main attacking countries and the number of OCOs they carried out in the years 1996–2019. The countries that carried out the most OCOs were China (157), Russia (127), Iran (60), North Korea (34), and the United States (32). Non-democratic countries are at the top of the list, but democratic countries—including the United States, Israel, and South Korea—have also carried out OCOs on a significant scale. All the attackers were states, except for cases where the identity of the attacker was unknown (22 cases—4.7 percent of all attacks).\nDefenders identity—figure 2 shows the sixteen most attacked countries and the number of OCOs they experienced in the years 1996–2019. The main defenders were the United States (140), South Korea (26), Ukraine (23), Japan (21), and India (18). Democratic countries seem to be at the top of the list, but non-democratic countries, such as Iran and China, have also experienced many cyberattacks and intrusions as well.⁴\n# Perpetrator Strategies\nThe perpetrator can choose between three possible strategies: maintaining silence, public denial, or claiming credit. Figure 3 illustrates the variance in strategy chosen by attacking countries. In most cases—374, or 78.6 percent—the perpetrators maintained silence. Public denial was chosen in seventy-one cases (15 percent), and\n\nThe Dynamics of Publicity and Secrecy in Offensive Cyber Operations\nFigure 3. Perpetrator strategies.\nin thirty-one cases (6.5 percent) the perpetrators claimed full credit for the attack.\nWhile maintaining silence is the most prevalent strategy, attacking states chose a public strategy in more than 20 percent of cases. Although trailing far behind the most common choice of silence, at one in five OCOs, the prevalence of public strategies is not negligible.\nNow that the variance in perpetrators' strategies has been established, we can turn to test which independent variables affect each kind of strategy. The model described below includes the variables of the regime type, GDP per capita, and the percentage of military force out of the total labor force in the country. The other variables describe the characteristics of the OCO (see Online Appendixes 2 and 3).\n# The Perpetrator—Results of the Multinomial Regression\nOnce we established the variance in attackers' strategies—which includes a meaningful share of public actions—we now turn to test which independent variables affect each kind of strategy. In each model, a comparison is made between the chances that the perpetrator chooses any of the public strategies versus the chance that it would choose to maintain ambiguity.\nThe results in table 2 show that the following variables—regime type, $^{5}$  GDP per capita, method of the attack, and third-party involvement—have an effect on the chances that the perpetrator would choose to claim\n\ncredit for an attack or publicly deny it over choosing silence. For robustness, I used several model specifications (see Online Appendix 4).\nRegime type—among countries with a democratic regime, the chances of publicly claiming credit for an attack rather than maintaining silence are 11.8 times higher than countries that are nondemocracies.\nCountries with anocratic regimes are four times more likely to publicly deny their involvement in the attack than maintain silence compared to countries that are not anocracies.\nGDP per capita—perpetrators with a high GDP per capita ( $&gt;$ 8,000) are 2.8 times less likely to choose public denial over silence than countries with a lower GDP ( $p = 0.04$ ), and even less likely to choose public credit claiming, at 3.9 times less than countries with a lower GDP.\nThis finding warrants a note, as it is not consistent with the results of the other multinomial regressions that followed that show clearly that high GDP countries are in fact more likely to self-attribute and claim credit. This discrepancy is possibly the result of countries where there is a disparity between regime type and GDP and which manifests differently in each regression. This particular result for the GDP variable is an isolated occurrence that does not affect the overall findings (see Online Appendix 4).\nMethod of the attack—in cases where the attack method is considered sophisticated, chances of the perpetrator publicly claiming credit rather than maintaining silence are 7.8 times lower than in cases of less sophisticated attacks. It appears that perpetrators employing sophisticated methods would tend to maintain silence.\nGIL BARAM\n\n|   | Chances of choosing public denial over silence | Chances of choosing public credit claiming over silence  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  Regime type (democracy) | 0.32 | 11.89**  |\n|   | (0.9) | (0.79)  |\n|  Regime type (anocracy) | 4.13* | 3.12  |\n|   | (0.8) | (1.07)  |\n|  GDP per capita | 0.35* | 0.25*  |\n|   | (0.6) | (0.81)  |\n|  Armed forces personnel (percent) | 0.43 | 1.46  |\n|   | (0.53) | (0.66)  |\n|  Method | 1.77 | 0.12**  |\n|   | (0.6) | (0.62)  |\n|  Severity | 1.29 | 0.54  |\n|   | (0.49) | (1.12)  |\n|  Target type (government) | 0.99 | 0.58  |\n|   | (0.44) | (0.69)  |\n|  Target type (military) | 0.54 | 0.43  |\n|   | (0.53) | (0.79)  |\n|  Third-party involvement | 6.15** | 0.93  |\n|   | (0.63) | (1.18)  |\n|  Discovery time (1 day to 6 months) | 1.66 | 0.69  |\n|   | (0.63) | (0.87)  |\n|  Discovery time (6 months to 1 year) | 0.54 | 0.24  |\n|   | (0.87) | (1.35)  |\n|  Discovery time (1–3 years) | 0.42 | 0.18  |\n|   | (0.85) | (1.33)  |\n|  Discovery time (more than 3 years) | 2.31 | 0.3  |\n|   | (0.75) | (1.33)  |\n|   | x² | df  |\n|   | 77.540 | 26  |\n|   |  | p  |\n|   |  | 0.0001  |\n|  Pseudo-R² |  | 90.2  |\n|  N |  | 317  |\nNotes: The results are presented using odds ratios. Standard errors are given in parentheses.\n* p &lt; 0.05, ** p &lt; 0.01, Pearson &lt; 0.0001.\nThird-party involvement—when a third party is involved in the OCO, perpetrators are six times more likely to choose public denial than in cases that do not involve a third party.\nWe can see, therefore, that a country's level of democracy has an impact on its choice of strategy. Democracies generally tend to publicly claim credit, while less democratic states tend to choose public denial. When the method of the attack is sophisticated, the chance that the perpetrator exposes the attack and claim credit for it is very low compared to the chance that it maintains silence. When a third party is involved in executing the OCO, the chances of the perpetrator choosing public denial increase greatly (six times more).\n## Defender Strategies\nAfter detecting an OCO, the defender has four possible strategies: full concealment; partial concealment; revealing the attack without attribution; and revealing the attack with public attribution. As seen in figure 4, there is greater variance here than for the perpetrator. In 222 cases (46.6 percent), the defender chose to maintain silence and made no public reference to the attack. However, in 238 cases (50 percent), defenders chose a public strategy that revealed the attack; among them, 108 cases (22.7 percent) were revealed without attribution and 103 (27.3 percent) with public attribution. Of the three public options, partial concealment was the least chosen strategy, taken in only 16 cases (3.4 percent).\nThe Dynamics of Publicity and Secrecy in Offensive Cyber Operations\nTable 3.

Standard errors are given in parentheses.\n* p &lt; 0.05, ** p &lt; 0.01.\nIf so, then, the data show that maintaining silence is not always the common strategy for defenders. With exactly one-half of the cases showing that defenders chose one of the public strategies, it seems that at least as often as not, defenders have an interest in going public.\n## The Defender—Results of the Multinomial Regression\nThe results show in table 3 that the following variables—regime type, GDP per capita, method of the attack, its severity and third-party involvement—impact the chances of the defender choosing a public strategy, whether with or without attribution, rather than choosing silence.\nRegime type—countries with a democratic regime were 6.2 times more likely to both publicly reveal the attack and publicly attribute it to a specific perpetrator than nondemocracies.\nCountries categorized as anocracies were 4.9 times more likely to choose to publicly reveal both the attack and the perpetrator over maintain silence than countries with a different regime type.\nGDP per capita—defenders with a high GDP per capita (&gt;$8,000) were 3.5 times more likely to choose to publicly reveal both the attack and the perpetrator than countries with a lower GDP per capita, and 7 times more likely to reveal the attack without attributing it than countries with lower GDP per capita.\nMethod of the attack—countries attacked by more sophisticated methods were 7 times less likely to publicly reveal both the attack and the perpetrator than countries attacked by less sophisticated methods.\nSeverity—countries that suffered severe attacks causing a considerable degree of damage had a 3.2 higher chance of choosing to publicly reveal both the attack and the perpetrator over choosing silence compared to\nGIL BARAM\n\ncountries that suffered lower severity attacks (p = 0.006). Chances of them choosing partial concealment were even higher—7.3 times more likely than countries that suffered attacks with lower severity.\nThird-party involvement—when a third party was involved in the attack, the chances of the defender choosing to publicly reveal both the attack and the perpetrator over maintaining silence are 3.4 times higher than in cases not involving a third party.\n## Discussion and Conclusions Secrecy is a crucial aspect of OCOs. The use of covert cyber operations allows governments and militaries to achieve their objectives without having to resort to more overt forms of aggression or conflict. However, the secrecy surrounding these operations can also create challenges. For example, it may be difficult for the public to hold government or military actors accountable for their actions in cyberspace if the details of these operations are not transparent.\nThis research note points out the variance in state strategies when deciding how to react after an OCO has taken place and also points out some initial explanations. The main innovation of the study is in demonstrating that countries have an interest in choosing public strategies on OCOs, even though these may often be concealed. In certain cases, the defenders have an interest in exposing the OCOs and sometimes even exposing the perpetrator. Perpetrators sometimes refrain from complete silence and make some form of public comment—denial or credit claiming.\nThe research offers a systematic analysis of the range of strategies and the chances of choosing each. Using variables to quantify and qualify the characteristics of countries (e.g., regime type, economic and military power) and the OCOs (e.g., method, target, third-party involvement) historically involved in cyber conflict over the past two and a half decades allowed an intersectional analysis of which strategies were chosen by whom, and offered initial insights regarding under what conditions.\nThe findings show that the perpetrator's strategy has clear characteristics. While maintaining silence is the preferred strategy, in about one-fifth of the cases the perpetrator prefers to relinquish secrecy by publicly claiming credit or at least publicly denying. The frequency of public strategies is not negligible, and although they do not exceed the frequency of silence, it appears that the perpetrator is often interested in publicly addressing the attacks it has committed.\nWhen the perpetrator was a democracy, there was eleven to twelve times higher chance that it will choose to expose the OCO it has committed and claim credit to itself and not maintain silence. When the perpetrator was not a democracy, there was a four times higher chance that it will choose public denial and not maintain silence.\nIn the strategies of the defender, there is greater variance: in almost half of the cases (46.6 percent), the defender chose to remain silent and not address the OCO publicly. However, in the second half of the cases, it chose public strategies. Publicity is expressed in two ways: exposing the OCO without attribution to a particular perpetrator and exposing it with public attribution. A partial concealment strategy has only come up in less than 4 percent of cases. From the data, it can be seen that in many cases the defender chose to relinquish secrecy and reveal the fact that it was attacked. When the defender was a democracy, there is a five to six times higher chance that it will choose to expose the OCO and the perpetrator. In addition, when it had a high GDP, it is 3.5–4 times more likely to choose to expose the OCO and the perpetrator.\nIn terms of variables related to the OCO itself, it appears that the target type and the involvement of a third party had a significant impact on the likelihood of the The Dynamics of Publicity and Secrecy in Offensive Cyber Operations perpetrator and the defender choosing public strategies. When a third party was involved in carrying out the OCO and when the targets were nonmilitary, the chances increased that countries would choose a public strategy.\nWhen it comes to public strategies, perpetrators with a low level of democracy had a higher chance of choosing public denial or silence, and those with a higher degree of democracy are more likely to self-attribute, that is, claim credit for the OCO. Defenders with a high level of democracy tend to expose the OCO more than nondemocracies.\nWhen it comes to the severity of the OCO, the results were significant for two of the three strategies available to the defender: partial concealment and fully exposing the OCOs with public attribution. Regarding the intermediate strategy of exposing the attack without attribution, the results obtained were not significant. Here, we must bear in mind that extensive damage is often visible and cannot easily be concealed, thereby forcing defenders to take some form of public strategy. But why these specific two of the three options? A possible explanation is that a defender will choose full exposure and public attribution when it can identify the perpetrator with high degree of certainty, and partial concealment, that is, claiming malfunction, when it cannot attribute the attack or does not want to. Therefore, it appears that in cases of obvious damage that cannot be concealed, the intermediate strategy of exposing the attack without exposing the perpetrator carries no significant advantages. Furthermore, when the OCO was carried out by using a more sophisticated method, both perpetrators and defenders had higher chances to remain silent.\nThis study provides initial insights regarding the importance of political characteristics of the countries on either side of OCOs, and in identifying previously unexplored patterns of political action. Moving forward, future research should consider several conditioning variables.\nFirst, how good are the defender's retaliatory options? If they can retaliate, are defenders more likely to publicize, whereas if they cannot retaliate, are they more likely to remain silent? Relatedly, the decision to publicize is conditioned by whether the public would know that something had happened. For example, the UK government could hardly deny that WannaCry (2017) had happened within the United Kingdom, given that most of the National Health System was affected.6 Second, is the decision to publicize conditioned by whether the OCO is exploited for kinetic targets or con fined wholly within cyberspace? Consider Israel's\"Operation Orchard\"(2007), in which Syrian air defenses were reportedly cyberattacked in order to buy time for a kinetic air raid.\nThird, when it comes to regime type distinction, future research should consider several issues: Is it that democracies are some of the most advanced cyber powers, such as the United States, Israel, the United Kingdom, that are driving the results? Alternatively, perhaps democracies are particularly assertive overseas, so the results are effectively showing their wider foreign policy.\n## Supplementary Information Supplementary information is available at the Journal of Global Security Studies ## Acknowledgments The author would like to thank Prof. Isaac Ben Israel, Prof. Udi Sommer and Prof. Yotam Margalit for their insightful comments on an earlier version of this project, and to Eden Poch, Dana Litman, Adi Lotan and Noya Peer for the excellent research assistance.

The use of covert cyber operations allows governments and militaries to achieve their objectives without having to resort to more overt forms of aggression or conflict. However, the secrecy surrounding these operations can also create challenges. For example, it may be difficult for the public to hold government or military actors accountable for their actions in cyberspace if the details of these operations are not transparent."

Cependant, ces dernières années, tant les responsables que les victimes ont reconnu publiquement leur implication dans des COO. Ce choix stratégique est-il commun chez les États? Quelles en sont les caractéristiques? Je montre qu'il ne s'agit pas d'un choix binaire et qu'il existe différentes stratégies possibles de chaque côté. Ensuite, je m'intéresse aux schémas comportementaux des États que l'on peut identifier à l'aide de données compilées sur des COO entre 1996 et 2019. Je montre qu'abandonner le secret est un phénomène qui existe tout en indiquant les caractéristiques des États et leurs probabilités de choisir chaque stratégie. Les premiers résultats révèlent une utilisation importante des stratégies publiques par les auteurs (20 percent), et encore plus importante par les victimes (50 percent). Ils indiquent aussi que les démocraties favorisent la réclamation et l'attribution publiques de la responsabilité, tandis que les pays moins démocratiques ont tendance à nier publiquement. Comme les gouvernements prennent de plus en plus part à des COO, les implications de cette note de recherche peuvent intéresser autant les chercheurs que les professionnels.\nKeywords: covert actions, cyberattacks, offensive cyber operations Palabras clave: acciones encubiertas, ciberataques, operaciones cibernéticas ofensivas Mots clés: actions secrètes, cyberattaques, cyberopérations offensives # Introduction In July 2020, in a rare public statement of that sort, US President Donald Trump took credit for an offensive cyber operation (OCO) against Russia's Internet Research Agency in St. Petersburg 2 years earlier. This was the first time an American president took credit for an OCO against another nation. Is this case of publicly claiming credit for an OCO an exception?\nScholarship suggests that perpetrators and defenders have incentives to keep their OCOs covert and that they might benefit from the advantages of deception. Yet, the cases where they do decide to go public justify a deeper examination as OCOs are being publicly revealed, discussed, and acknowledged by perpetrators and defenders alike in the past years.\nIn this research note, I show that the decision governments face is not a binary political choice between concealing or revealing the OCO that they were involved in. Rather there is variance in the available strategies,\nranging from complete silence to credit claiming for the perpetrator and from complete silence to public attribution for the defender. In this systematic analysis of both sides, I use data to show that this variance exists and how selected characteristics of the defender and perpetrator and of the OCOs themselves correlate with decision to conceal or disclose the operation.\nThis paper proceeds as follows. The first part discusses the role of secrecy and publicity in OCOs and the evolving relationship between the two. It points out on the possible strategies of each side and the variance within them. The second presents the variance in the strategies according to the data and the results of the multinomial regressions examining the variables affecting the chances of both the perpetrator and the defender to choose public strategy over secrecy. The final part discusses the initial findings and their contribution to the understanding of the role of secrecy in OCOs within the broader disciplines of international relations and canvasses future application and research avenues.\nThe nature of OCOs is such that they cannot be fully observed, since an unknown number of them are not revealed. These are the so-called unknown-unknowns, or non-observation cyberattacks and intrusions . These are OCOs assumed to have taken place but not reported and therefore not recorded in the open data sources we used. All cyber-related research trying\nGIL BARAM\nto empirically examine OCOs encounters a form of this problem. For the purposes of this paper, only OCOs that have been publicly revealed and for which there exist sufficient data to code were included (see Online Appendix 1 for details).",
    "## Secrecy and Publicity in Offensive Cyber Operations": "Historically, OCOs were considered inherently secret: as General Michael Hayden, former director of the National Security Agency (NSA) and Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), highlighted the degree of secrecy surrounding OCOs: “Even the phrase ‘offensive cyber operations’ was classified. Not what it might mean, or what the targets might be, or what technologies would be involved—merely the phrase itself” .\nThe covertness of OCOs is two-fold, pertaining to both action and actor. First, the OCOs themselves can be kept covert. Unlike kinetic means, some of the technological characteristics of OCOs enable perpetrators to obscure the way in which they were carried out and conceal them from both the defender and the public at large. The second aspect regards the perpetrators, who can conceal their identity and maintain covertness.²\nRecent research discussed the importance of deception in the cyber domain and the challenges it creates for states to distinguish between espionage activities in cyberspace and OCOs . Furthermore, it suggests that actors can gain unprecedented strategic advantages in conflict short of war by leveraging the scale, speed, and anonymity of cyberspace .\nOther scholars offer to characterize OCOs as an intelligence contest, with the aim of gaining an advantage in information acquisition. In this context, successful execution of OCOs necessitates limiting the other side’s access to information. National intelligence services are keenly aware of their own susceptibility to espionage and consequently engage in counterintelligence practices to safeguard their digital information (see Chesney and Smeets 2020; Rovner 2021).\nVarious explanations pointed out on the benefits of the use of covert action, ranging from preventing escalation to the ability to signal in secret. These lead to the expectation that countries might prefer to maintain ambiguity or secrecy rather than making a public responses . In addition, secrecy enables leaders to minimize domestic political repercussions, such as facing public backlash for provoking a crisis that may result in an undesirable escalation or for stepping back from a crisis to avoid one .\nAn option of partial concealment exists when full concealment is not possible, such as when an OCO has been revealed by the perpetrator or a third party , or when the damage caused cannot be concealed. In this case, the defender does not want to admit that an attack has taken place but must acknowledge visible damage, and therefore attributes it to a technical malfunction. Examining this option empirically is difficult, since the defender does not reveal that an attack did in fact occur .\nThere are also some public options for both the perpetrator and the defender. A standing element of covert action is plausible deniability, which can offer the perpetrator an advantage especially when the covert action is a cyberattack. Deniability allows countries to act in the “gray area” without exacerbating the conflict, although it is often clear to domestic and international audiences that covert action has been taken .\nEven when the perpetrator publicly denies involvement, it may or may not have actually carried out the attack attributed to it. Therefore, the key question is if public denial is not perceived as credible, why should states choose this option? This question is further complicated when it comes to OCOs, an arena even more secretive than traditional covert warfare. Therefore, switching to the public option—even if it is a denial and not a public credit claiming—requires an explanation, and literature identifies several . This study identifies the option of public denial as one of the public strategies available to the perpetrator, and examines the possible circumstances in which this strategy might be chosen.\nAnother important aspect of OCOs is attribution, recognized as one of the most difficult problems in the cyber world . Attribution is defined as “determining the identity or location of the perpetrator” . The\n² It is important to distinguish between clandestine and covert operations in this context. A covert operation is one that is conducted without the local population and enemy forces being aware of its existence. Clandestine operations are secret operations that are carried out in a manner that conceals the identity of the operator. In Lindsay’s view , the “perfect” covert action would hide both the harm and the person who committed it.\nThe Dynamics of Publicity and Secrecy in Offensive Cyber Operations\nTable 1. Perpetrator and defender's strategies\n|   | Option #1 | Option #2 | Option #3 | Option #4  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  Perpetrator strategy | Full concealment | Public denial | Public credit claiming |   |\n|  Defender strategy | Full concealment | Partial concealment | Publicizing without attribution | Publicizing with public attribution  |\nattribution process involves different aspects, including technical, political, legal, strategic and other components . There are various techniques for carrying out a process of attributing an OCO, and it often requires a considerable investment of different kinds of resources (Broeders, De Busser, and Pawlak 2020).\nIn the past few years, it seems that state-sponsored OCOs are being publicly attributed to specific state actors and this trend is being discussed theoretically . Although this significant development helps position public attribution as a research issue in itself, most studies in the field do not deal with the dynamics between the perpetrator and defender (for exceptions, see Edwards et al. 2017; Schulzke 2018; Baram 2023). It is important to mention that defenders could decide to reveal the fact that they have suffered a cyberattack or intrusion without attributing it to a specific perpetrator.\nRecent discussion regarding voluntary attribution by cyber perpetrators, also described as public credit claiming, maintained that although secrecy is an essential feature of OCOs, some actors choose to publicly claim credit for OCOs they have committed; specifically, this phenomenon is examined among non-state actors .\nThe way in which states perceive and understand risk and uncertainty in cyberspace varies significantly, resulting in a less-than-ideal status quo that contributes to heightened levels of risk and uncertainty . When either sides need to decide whether to go public or not, there is a degree of uncertainty: the aggressor is not sure how well its operation has gone. The defender is not quite sure (1) if it has encountered a cyberattack or a technical glitch and (2) how far it has been compromised. These are \"hidden\" possibilities, and therefore hard to study but still worth mentioning.\nBased on this literature, I categorize the following strategies: the perpetrator can chose from (1) full concealment; (2) public denial; and (3) public credit claiming. The defender can chose from (1) full concealment; (2) partial concealment—disclosing damage but denying that it was caused by a deliberate attack (claiming technical malfunctions, system glitches etc.); (3) publicizing the\nOCO without attribution—publicly disclosing that an OCO took place but refraining from publicly identifying the perpetrator; and (4) publicizing the OCO with public attribution—both publicly disclosing that an OCO occurred and publicly attributing it to a specific perpetrator. Table 1 summarizes these strategies. $^3$\nAlthough exposing the OCO and attributing it to a perpetrator might damage the defender's image, this also seems to carry certain benefits as well. As the primary objective of this study was to examine the relationship between states' characteristics and their chosen strategies during cyber conflict, several additional variables are required to be taken into account that are associated with the OCOs themselves: the target that was attacked, the method used, whether a third party was involved, and the severity of the damage caused.",
    "## Empirical Analysis": "This section is divided into three parts. First, I discuss the perpetrator and the defender identity and the main countries involved in cyber conflict according to the data. Second, I show variance in the dependent variables, perpetrator strategy and defender strategy, and discuss its meaning and significance. Third, I examine the independent variables—selected factors that might affect perpetrators and defenders' chances for choosing publicity over secrecy.\nMultinomial logistic regression analyses were conducted in order to compare all possible strategies of the perpetrator and the defender, on the assumption that decision-makers consider all available options before choosing, at least at the beginning of the process.\nGIL BARAM\nFigure 2. The identity of the defenders and the number of OCOs they experienced in 1996–2019.\n# Actors Identity\nPerpetrators identity—figure 1 shows the main attacking countries and the number of OCOs they carried out in the years 1996–2019. The countries that carried out the most OCOs were China (157), Russia (127), Iran (60), North Korea (34), and the United States (32). Non-democratic countries are at the top of the list, but democratic countries—including the United States, Israel, and South Korea—have also carried out OCOs on a significant scale. All the attackers were states, except for cases where the identity of the attacker was unknown (22 cases—4.7 percent of all attacks).\nDefenders identity—figure 2 shows the sixteen most attacked countries and the number of OCOs they experienced in the years 1996–2019. The main defenders were the United States (140), South Korea (26), Ukraine (23), Japan (21), and India (18). Democratic countries seem to be at the top of the list, but non-democratic countries, such as Iran and China, have also experienced many cyberattacks and intrusions as well.⁴\n# Perpetrator Strategies\nThe perpetrator can choose between three possible strategies: maintaining silence, public denial, or claiming credit. Figure 3 illustrates the variance in strategy chosen by attacking countries. In most cases—374, or 78.6 percent—the perpetrators maintained silence. Public denial was chosen in seventy-one cases (15 percent), and\nThe Dynamics of Publicity and Secrecy in Offensive Cyber Operations\nFigure 3. Perpetrator strategies.\nin thirty-one cases (6.5 percent) the perpetrators claimed full credit for the attack.\nWhile maintaining silence is the most prevalent strategy, attacking states chose a public strategy in more than 20 percent of cases. Although trailing far behind the most common choice of silence, at one in five OCOs, the prevalence of public strategies is not negligible.\nNow that the variance in perpetrators' strategies has been established, we can turn to test which independent variables affect each kind of strategy. The model described below includes the variables of the regime type, GDP per capita, and the percentage of military force out of the total labor force in the country. The other variables describe the characteristics of the OCO (see Online Appendixes 2 and 3).\n# The Perpetrator—Results of the Multinomial Regression\nOnce we established the variance in attackers' strategies—which includes a meaningful share of public actions—we now turn to test which independent variables affect each kind of strategy. In each model, a comparison is made between the chances that the perpetrator chooses any of the public strategies versus the chance that it would choose to maintain ambiguity.\nThe results in table 2 show that the following variables—regime type, $^{5}$  GDP per capita, method of the attack, and third-party involvement—have an effect on the chances that the perpetrator would choose to claim\ncredit for an attack or publicly deny it over choosing silence. For robustness, I used several model specifications (see Online Appendix 4).\nRegime type—among countries with a democratic regime, the chances of publicly claiming credit for an attack rather than maintaining silence are 11.8 times higher than countries that are nondemocracies.\nCountries with anocratic regimes are four times more likely to publicly deny their involvement in the attack than maintain silence compared to countries that are not anocracies.\nGDP per capita—perpetrators with a high GDP per capita ( $&gt;$ 8,000) are 2.8 times less likely to choose public denial over silence than countries with a lower GDP ( $p = 0.04$ ), and even less likely to choose public credit claiming, at 3.9 times less than countries with a lower GDP.\nThis finding warrants a note, as it is not consistent with the results of the other multinomial regressions that followed that show clearly that high GDP countries are in fact more likely to self-attribute and claim credit. This discrepancy is possibly the result of countries where there is a disparity between regime type and GDP and which manifests differently in each regression. This particular result for the GDP variable is an isolated occurrence that does not affect the overall findings (see Online Appendix 4).\nMethod of the attack—in cases where the attack method is considered sophisticated, chances of the perpetrator publicly claiming credit rather than maintaining silence are 7.8 times lower than in cases of less sophisticated attacks. It appears that perpetrators employing sophisticated methods would tend to maintain silence.\nGIL BARAM\n|   | Chances of choosing public denial over silence | Chances of choosing public credit claiming over silence  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  Regime type (democracy) | 0.32 | 11.89**  |\n|   | (0.9) | (0.79)  |\n|  Regime type (anocracy) | 4.13* | 3.12  |\n|   | (0.8) | (1.07)  |\n|  GDP per capita | 0.35* | 0.25*  |\n|   | (0.6) | (0.81)  |\n|  Armed forces personnel (percent) | 0.43 | 1.46  |\n|   | (0.53) | (0.66)  |\n|  Method | 1.77 | 0.12**  |\n|   | (0.6) | (0.62)  |\n|  Severity | 1.29 | 0.54  |\n|   | (0.49) | (1.12)  |\n|  Target type (government) | 0.99 | 0.58  |\n|   | (0.44) | (0.69)  |\n|  Target type (military) | 0.54 | 0.43  |\n|   | (0.53) | (0.79)  |\n|  Third-party involvement | 6.15** | 0.93  |\n|   | (0.63) | (1.18)  |\n|  Discovery time (1 day to 6 months) | 1.66 | 0.69  |\n|   | (0.63) | (0.87)  |\n|  Discovery time (6 months to 1 year) | 0.54 | 0.24  |\n|   | (0.87) | (1.35)  |\n|  Discovery time (1–3 years) | 0.42 | 0.18  |\n|   | (0.85) | (1.33)  |\n|  Discovery time (more than 3 years) | 2.31 | 0.3  |\n|   | (0.75) | (1.33)  |\n|   | x² | df  |\n|   | 77.540 | 26  |\n|   |  | p  |\n|   |  | 0.0001  |\n|  Pseudo-R² |  | 90.2  |\n|  N |  | 317  |\nNotes: The results are presented using odds ratios. Standard errors are given in parentheses.\n* p &lt; 0.05, ** p &lt; 0.01, Pearson &lt; 0.0001.\nThird-party involvement—when a third party is involved in the OCO, perpetrators are six times more likely to choose public denial than in cases that do not involve a third party.\nWe can see, therefore, that a country's level of democracy has an impact on its choice of strategy. Democracies generally tend to publicly claim credit, while less democratic states tend to choose public denial. When the method of the attack is sophisticated, the chance that the perpetrator exposes the attack and claim credit for it is very low compared to the chance that it maintains silence. When a third party is involved in executing the OCO, the chances of the perpetrator choosing public denial increase greatly (six times more).",
    "## Defender Strategies": "After detecting an OCO, the defender has four possible strategies: full concealment; partial concealment; revealing the attack without attribution; and revealing the attack with public attribution. As seen in figure 4, there is greater variance here than for the perpetrator. In 222 cases (46.6 percent), the defender chose to maintain silence and made no public reference to the attack. However, in 238 cases (50 percent), defenders chose a public strategy that revealed the attack; among them, 108 cases (22.7 percent) were revealed without attribution and 103 (27.3 percent) with public attribution. Of the three public options, partial concealment was the least chosen strategy, taken in only 16 cases (3.4 percent).\nThe Dynamics of Publicity and Secrecy in Offensive Cyber Operations\nTable 3.

With exactly one-half of the cases showing that defenders chose one of the public strategies, it seems that at least as often as not, defenders have an interest in going public.",
    "## The Defender—Results of the Multinomial Regression": "The results show in table 3 that the following variables—regime type, GDP per capita, method of the attack, its severity and third-party involvement—impact the chances of the defender choosing a public strategy, whether with or without attribution, rather than choosing silence.\nRegime type—countries with a democratic regime were 6.2 times more likely to both publicly reveal the attack and publicly attribute it to a specific perpetrator than nondemocracies.\nCountries categorized as anocracies were 4.9 times more likely to choose to publicly reveal both the attack and the perpetrator over maintain silence than countries with a different regime type.\nGDP per capita—defenders with a high GDP per capita (&gt;$8,000) were 3.5 times more likely to choose to publicly reveal both the attack and the perpetrator than countries with a lower GDP per capita, and 7 times more likely to reveal the attack without attributing it than countries with lower GDP per capita.\nMethod of the attack—countries attacked by more sophisticated methods were 7 times less likely to publicly reveal both the attack and the perpetrator than countries attacked by less sophisticated methods.\nSeverity—countries that suffered severe attacks causing a considerable degree of damage had a 3.2 higher chance of choosing to publicly reveal both the attack and the perpetrator over choosing silence compared to\nGIL BARAM\ncountries that suffered lower severity attacks (p = 0.006). Chances of them choosing partial concealment were even higher—7.3 times more likely than countries that suffered attacks with lower severity.\nThird-party involvement—when a third party was involved in the attack, the chances of the defender choosing to publicly reveal both the attack and the perpetrator over maintaining silence are 3.4 times higher than in cases not involving a third party.",
    "## Discussion and Conclusions Secrecy is a crucial aspect of OCOs. The use of covert cyber operations allows governments and militaries to achieve their objectives without having to resort to more overt forms of aggression or conflict. However, the secrecy surrounding these operations can also create challenges. For example, it may be difficult for the public to hold government or military actors accountable for their actions in cyberspace if the details of these operations are not transparent.": "This research note points out the variance in state strategies when deciding how to react after an OCO has taken place and also points out some initial explanations. The main innovation of the study is in demonstrating that countries have an interest in choosing public strategies on OCOs, even though these may often be concealed. In certain cases, the defenders have an interest in exposing the OCOs and sometimes even exposing the perpetrator. Perpetrators sometimes refrain from complete silence and make some form of public comment—denial or credit claiming.\nThe research offers a systematic analysis of the range of strategies and the chances of choosing each. Using variables to quantify and qualify the characteristics of countries (e.g., regime type, economic and military power) and the OCOs (e.g., method, target, third-party involvement) historically involved in cyber conflict over the past two and a half decades allowed an intersectional analysis of which strategies were chosen by whom, and offered initial insights regarding under what conditions.\nThe findings show that the perpetrator's strategy has clear characteristics. While maintaining silence is the preferred strategy, in about one-fifth of the cases the perpetrator prefers to relinquish secrecy by publicly claiming credit or at least publicly denying. The frequency of public strategies is not negligible, and although they do not exceed the frequency of silence, it appears that the perpetrator is often interested in publicly addressing the attacks it has committed.\nWhen the perpetrator was a democracy, there was eleven to twelve times higher chance that it will choose to expose the OCO it has committed and claim credit to itself and not maintain silence. When the perpetrator was not a democracy, there was a four times higher chance that it will choose public denial and not maintain silence.\nIn the strategies of the defender, there is greater variance: in almost half of the cases (46.6 percent), the defender chose to remain silent and not address the OCO publicly. However, in the second half of the cases, it chose public strategies. Publicity is expressed in two ways: exposing the OCO without attribution to a particular perpetrator and exposing it with public attribution. A partial concealment strategy has only come up in less than 4 percent of cases. From the data, it can be seen that in many cases the defender chose to relinquish secrecy and reveal the fact that it was attacked. When the defender was a democracy, there is a five to six times higher chance that it will choose to expose the OCO and the perpetrator. In addition, when it had a high GDP, it is 3.5–4 times more likely to choose to expose the OCO and the perpetrator.\nIn terms of variables related to the OCO itself, it appears that the target type and the involvement of a third party had a significant impact on the likelihood of the The Dynamics of Publicity and Secrecy in Offensive Cyber Operations perpetrator and the defender choosing public strategies. When a third party was involved in carrying out the OCO and when the targets were nonmilitary, the chances increased that countries would choose a public strategy.\nWhen it comes to public strategies, perpetrators with a low level of democracy had a higher chance of choosing public denial or silence, and those with a higher degree of democracy are more likely to self-attribute, that is, claim credit for the OCO. Defenders with a high level of democracy tend to expose the OCO more than nondemocracies.\nWhen it comes to the severity of the OCO, the results were significant for two of the three strategies available to the defender: partial concealment and fully exposing the OCOs with public attribution. Regarding the intermediate strategy of exposing the attack without attribution, the results obtained were not significant. Here, we must bear in mind that extensive damage is often visible and cannot easily be concealed, thereby forcing defenders to take some form of public strategy. But why these specific two of the three options? A possible explanation is that a defender will choose full exposure and public attribution when it can identify the perpetrator with high degree of certainty, and partial concealment, that is, claiming malfunction, when it cannot attribute the attack or does not want to. Therefore, it appears that in cases of obvious damage that cannot be concealed, the intermediate strategy of exposing the attack without exposing the perpetrator carries no significant advantages. Furthermore, when the OCO was carried out by using a more sophisticated method, both perpetrators and defenders had higher chances to remain silent.\nThis study provides initial insights regarding the importance of political characteristics of the countries on either side of OCOs, and in identifying previously unexplored patterns of political action. Moving forward, future research should consider several conditioning variables.\nFirst, how good are the defender's retaliatory options? If they can retaliate, are defenders more likely to publicize, whereas if they cannot retaliate, are they more likely to remain silent? Relatedly, the decision to publicize is conditioned by whether the public would know that something had happened. For example, the UK government could hardly deny that WannaCry (2017) had happened within the United Kingdom, given that most of the National Health System was affected.6 Second, is the decision to publicize conditioned by whether the OCO is exploited for kinetic targets or con fined wholly within cyberspace? Consider Israel's\"Operation Orchard\"(2007), in which Syrian air defenses were reportedly cyberattacked in order to buy time for a kinetic air raid.\nThird, when it comes to regime type distinction, future research should consider several issues: Is it that democracies are some of the most advanced cyber powers, such as the United States, Israel, the United Kingdom, that are driving the results? Alternatively, perhaps democracies are particularly assertive overseas, so the results are effectively showing their wider foreign policy.",

Over the past few years, however, perpetrators and defenders have publicly acknowledged their involvement in OCOs. How common is this strategic choice among states? What are its characteristics? In this research note I show that this is not a binary choice, and that there is variance in the strategies available to either side. I then examine what state behavior patterns can be identified by using compiled data of OCOs between 1996 and 2019. I show that this phenomenon of giving up secrecy is occurring and point out on states' characteristics and probabilities of choosing each strategy. Initial findings show significant use of public strategies by perpetrators (20 percent) and more so by defenders (50 percent), and that democracies tend toward public credit claiming and attribution, while less democratic countries tend toward public denial. As governments increasingly engage in OCOs, the implications of this research note are of interest to scholars and practitioners alike.\n## Resumen De manera histórica, se ha considerado a las operaciones cibernéticas ofensivas (OCO) como una práctica que los Estados podrían llevar a cabo de manera encubierta, lejos del ojo público, y en la que tanto los perpetradores como los defensores tendrían incentivos para permanecer en silencio. Sin embargo, durante los últimos años han existido tanto perpetradores como defensores que han reconocido públicamente su participación en OCO. ¿Cómo de común es esta elección estratégica entre los Estados? ¿Cuáles son sus características? Demostramos que esta no es una elección binaria, y que existen variaciones en materia de las estrategias disponibles para ambas partes. A continuación, examinamos, mediante el uso de datos recopilados de OCO que tuvieron lugar entre 1996 y 2019, qué patrones de comportamiento por parte de los Estados se pueden identificar. Demostramos que este fenómeno, consistente en renunciar al carácter secreto de las OCO, está teniendo lugar y señalamos tanto las características como las probabilidades de los Estados de elegir cada estrategia. Los hallazgos iniciales muestran un uso significativo de estrategias de carácter público por parte de los perpetradores (20 percent) que es aún mayor por parte de los defensores (50 percent). Los hallazgos iniciales también demuestran que las democracias tienden a autoinculparse de manera pública y a atribuirse a sí mismas la autoría de las OCO, mientras que los países menos democráticos tienden a la negación pública. Debido a que los gobiernos se involucran cada vez más en las OCO, las implicaciones de esta nota de investigación resultan de interés tanto para académicos como para profesionales.\nBaram, Gil (2023) Public Secrets: The Dynamics of Publicity and Secrecy in Offensive Cyber Operations.

Cependant, ces dernières années, tant les responsables que les victimes ont reconnu publiquement leur implication dans des COO. Ce choix stratégique est-il commun chez les États?

Ensuite, je m'intéresse aux schémas comportementaux des États que l'on peut identifier à l'aide de données compilées sur des COO entre 1996 et 2019. Je montre qu'abandonner le secret est un phénomène qui existe tout en indiquant les caractéristiques des États et leurs probabilités de choisir chaque stratégie. Les premiers résultats révèlent une utilisation importante des stratégies publiques par les auteurs (20 percent), et encore plus importante par les victimes (50 percent).

This was the first time an American president took credit for an OCO against another nation. Is this case of publicly claiming credit for an OCO an exception?\nScholarship suggests that perpetrators and defenders have incentives to keep their OCOs covert and that they might benefit from the advantages of deception. Yet, the cases where they do decide to go public justify a deeper examination as OCOs are being publicly revealed, discussed, and acknowledged by perpetrators and defenders alike in the past years.\nIn this research note, I show that the decision governments face is not a binary political choice between concealing or revealing the OCO that they were involved in. Rather there is variance in the available strategies,\n\nranging from complete silence to credit claiming for the perpetrator and from complete silence to public attribution for the defender. In this systematic analysis of both sides, I use data to show that this variance exists and how selected characteristics of the defender and perpetrator and of the OCOs themselves correlate with decision to conceal or disclose the operation.\nThis paper proceeds as follows. The first part discusses the role of secrecy and publicity in OCOs and the evolving relationship between the two. It points out on the possible strategies of each side and the variance within them. The second presents the variance in the strategies according to the data and the results of the multinomial regressions examining the variables affecting the chances of both the perpetrator and the defender to choose public strategy over secrecy. The final part discusses the initial findings and their contribution to the understanding of the role of secrecy in OCOs within the broader disciplines of international relations and canvasses future application and research avenues.\nThe nature of OCOs is such that they cannot be fully observed, since an unknown number of them are not revealed. These are the so-called unknown-unknowns, or non-observation cyberattacks and intrusions . These are OCOs assumed to have taken place but not reported and therefore not recorded in the open data sources we used. All cyber-related research trying\nGIL BARAM\nto empirically examine OCOs encounters a form of this problem. For the purposes of this paper, only OCOs that have been publicly revealed and for which there exist sufficient data to code were included (see Online Appendix 1 for details).\n## Secrecy and Publicity in Offensive Cyber Operations\nHistorically, OCOs were considered inherently secret: as General Michael Hayden, former director of the National Security Agency (NSA) and Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), highlighted the degree of secrecy surrounding OCOs: “Even the phrase ‘offensive cyber operations’ was classified. Not what it might mean, or what the targets might be, or what technologies would be involved—merely the phrase itself” .\nThe covertness of OCOs is two-fold, pertaining to both action and actor. First, the OCOs themselves can be kept covert. Unlike kinetic means, some of the technological characteristics of OCOs enable perpetrators to obscure the way in which they were carried out and conceal them from both the defender and the public at large. The second aspect regards the perpetrators, who can conceal their identity and maintain covertness.²\nRecent research discussed the importance of deception in the cyber domain and the challenges it creates for states to distinguish between espionage activities in cyberspace and OCOs . Furthermore, it suggests that actors can gain unprecedented strategic advantages in conflict short of war by leveraging the scale, speed, and anonymity of cyberspace .\nOther scholars offer to characterize OCOs as an intelligence contest, with the aim of gaining an advantage in information acquisition. In this context, successful execution of OCOs necessitates limiting the other side’s access to information. National intelligence services are keenly aware of their own susceptibility to espionage and consequently engage in counterintelligence practices to safeguard their digital information (see Chesney and Smeets 2020; Rovner 2021).\nVarious explanations pointed out on the benefits of the use of covert action, ranging from preventing escalation to the ability to signal in secret. These lead to the expectation that countries might prefer to maintain ambiguity or secrecy rather than making a public responses . In addition, secrecy enables leaders to minimize domestic political repercussions, such as facing public backlash for provoking a crisis that may result in an undesirable escalation or for stepping back from a crisis to avoid one .\nAn option of partial concealment exists when full concealment is not possible, such as when an OCO has been revealed by the perpetrator or a third party , or when the damage caused cannot be concealed. In this case, the defender does not want to admit that an attack has taken place but must acknowledge visible damage, and therefore attributes it to a technical malfunction. Examining this option empirically is difficult, since the defender does not reveal that an attack did in fact occur .\nThere are also some public options for both the perpetrator and the defender. A standing element of covert action is plausible deniability, which can offer the perpetrator an advantage especially when the covert action is a cyberattack. Deniability allows countries to act in the “gray area” without exacerbating the conflict, although it is often clear to domestic and international audiences that covert action has been taken .\nEven when the perpetrator publicly denies involvement, it may or may not have actually carried out the attack attributed to it. Therefore, the key question is if public denial is not perceived as credible, why should states choose this option? This question is further complicated when it comes to OCOs, an arena even more secretive than traditional covert warfare. Therefore, switching to the public option—even if it is a denial and not a public credit claiming—requires an explanation, and literature identifies several . This study identifies the option of public denial as one of the public strategies available to the perpetrator, and examines the possible circumstances in which this strategy might be chosen.\nAnother important aspect of OCOs is attribution, recognized as one of the most difficult problems in the cyber world . Attribution is defined as “determining the identity or location of the perpetrator” . The\n² It is important to distinguish between clandestine and covert operations in this context. A covert operation is one that is conducted without the local population and enemy forces being aware of its existence. Clandestine operations are secret operations that are carried out in a manner that conceals the identity of the operator. In Lindsay’s view , the “perfect” covert action would hide both the harm and the person who committed it.\nThe Dynamics of Publicity and Secrecy in Offensive Cyber Operations\nTable 1. Perpetrator and defender's strategies\n|   | Option #1 | Option #2 | Option #3 | Option #4  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  Perpetrator strategy | Full concealment | Public denial | Public credit claiming |   |\n|  Defender strategy | Full concealment | Partial concealment | Publicizing without attribution | Publicizing with public attribution  |\nattribution process involves different aspects, including technical, political, legal, strategic and other components . There are various techniques for carrying out a process of attributing an OCO, and it often requires a considerable investment of different kinds of resources (Broeders, De Busser, and Pawlak 2020).\nIn the past few years, it seems that state-sponsored OCOs are being publicly attributed to specific state actors and this trend is being discussed theoretically . Although this significant development helps position public attribution as a research issue in itself, most studies in the field do not deal with the dynamics between the perpetrator and defender (for exceptions, see Edwards et al. 2017; Schulzke 2018; Baram 2023). It is important to mention that defenders could decide to reveal the fact that they have suffered a cyberattack or intrusion without attributing it to a specific perpetrator.\nRecent discussion regarding voluntary attribution by cyber perpetrators, also described as public credit claiming, maintained that although secrecy is an essential feature of OCOs, some actors choose to publicly claim credit for OCOs they have committed; specifically, this phenomenon is examined among non-state actors .\nThe way in which states perceive and understand risk and uncertainty in cyberspace varies significantly, resulting in a less-than-ideal status quo that contributes to heightened levels of risk and uncertainty . When either sides need to decide whether to go public or not, there is a degree of uncertainty: the aggressor is not sure how well its operation has gone. The defender is not quite sure (1) if it has encountered a cyberattack or a technical glitch and (2) how far it has been compromised. These are \"hidden\" possibilities, and therefore hard to study but still worth mentioning.\nBased on this literature, I categorize the following strategies: the perpetrator can chose from (1) full concealment; (2) public denial; and (3) public credit claiming. The defender can chose from (1) full concealment; (2) partial concealment—disclosing damage but denying that it was caused by a deliberate attack (claiming technical malfunctions, system glitches etc.); (3) publicizing the\nOCO without attribution—publicly disclosing that an OCO took place but refraining from publicly identifying the perpetrator; and (4) publicizing the OCO with public attribution—both publicly disclosing that an OCO occurred and publicly attributing it to a specific perpetrator. Table 1 summarizes these strategies. $^3$\nAlthough exposing the OCO and attributing it to a perpetrator might damage the defender's image, this also seems to carry certain benefits as well. As the primary objective of this study was to examine the relationship between states' characteristics and their chosen strategies during cyber conflict, several additional variables are required to be taken into account that are associated with the OCOs themselves: the target that was attacked, the method used, whether a third party was involved, and the severity of the damage caused.\n## Empirical Analysis\nThis section is divided into three parts. First, I discuss the perpetrator and the defender identity and the main countries involved in cyber conflict according to the data. Second, I show variance in the dependent variables, perpetrator strategy and defender strategy, and discuss its meaning and significance. Third, I examine the independent variables—selected factors that might affect perpetrators and defenders' chances for choosing publicity over secrecy.\nMultinomial logistic regression analyses were conducted in order to compare all possible strategies of the perpetrator and the defender, on the assumption that decision-makers consider all available options before choosing, at least at the beginning of the process.\n\nGIL BARAM\n\nFigure 2. The identity of the defenders and the number of OCOs they experienced in 1996–2019.\n# Actors Identity\nPerpetrators identity—figure 1 shows the main attacking countries and the number of OCOs they carried out in the years 1996–2019. The countries that carried out the most OCOs were China (157), Russia (127), Iran (60), North Korea (34), and the United States (32). Non-democratic countries are at the top of the list, but democratic countries—including the United States, Israel, and South Korea—have also carried out OCOs on a significant scale. All the attackers were states, except for cases where the identity of the attacker was unknown (22 cases—4.7 percent of all attacks).\nDefenders identity—figure 2 shows the sixteen most attacked countries and the number of OCOs they experienced in the years 1996–2019. The main defenders were the United States (140), South Korea (26), Ukraine (23), Japan (21), and India (18). Democratic countries seem to be at the top of the list, but non-democratic countries, such as Iran and China, have also experienced many cyberattacks and intrusions as well.⁴\n# Perpetrator Strategies\nThe perpetrator can choose between three possible strategies: maintaining silence, public denial, or claiming credit. Figure 3 illustrates the variance in strategy chosen by attacking countries. In most cases—374, or 78.6 percent—the perpetrators maintained silence. Public denial was chosen in seventy-one cases (15 percent), and\n\nThe Dynamics of Publicity and Secrecy in Offensive Cyber Operations\nFigure 3. Perpetrator strategies.\nin thirty-one cases (6.5 percent) the perpetrators claimed full credit for the attack.\nWhile maintaining silence is the most prevalent strategy, attacking states chose a public strategy in more than 20 percent of cases. Although trailing far behind the most common choice of silence, at one in five OCOs, the prevalence of public strategies is not negligible.\nNow that the variance in perpetrators' strategies has been established, we can turn to test which independent variables affect each kind of strategy. The model described below includes the variables of the regime type, GDP per capita, and the percentage of military force out of the total labor force in the country. The other variables describe the characteristics of the OCO (see Online Appendixes 2 and 3).\n# The Perpetrator—Results of the Multinomial Regression\nOnce we established the variance in attackers' strategies—which includes a meaningful share of public actions—we now turn to test which independent variables affect each kind of strategy. In each model, a comparison is made between the chances that the perpetrator chooses any of the public strategies versus the chance that it would choose to maintain ambiguity.\nThe results in table 2 show that the following variables—regime type, $^{5}$  GDP per capita, method of the attack, and third-party involvement—have an effect on the chances that the perpetrator would choose to claim\n\ncredit for an attack or publicly deny it over choosing silence. For robustness, I used several model specifications (see Online Appendix 4).\nRegime type—among countries with a democratic regime, the chances of publicly claiming credit for an attack rather than maintaining silence are 11.8 times higher than countries that are nondemocracies.\nCountries with anocratic regimes are four times more likely to publicly deny their involvement in the attack than maintain silence compared to countries that are not anocracies.\nGDP per capita—perpetrators with a high GDP per capita ( $&gt;$ 8,000) are 2.8 times less likely to choose public denial over silence than countries with a lower GDP ( $p = 0.04$ ), and even less likely to choose public credit claiming, at 3.9 times less than countries with a lower GDP.\nThis finding warrants a note, as it is not consistent with the results of the other multinomial regressions that followed that show clearly that high GDP countries are in fact more likely to self-attribute and claim credit. This discrepancy is possibly the result of countries where there is a disparity between regime type and GDP and which manifests differently in each regression. This particular result for the GDP variable is an isolated occurrence that does not affect the overall findings (see Online Appendix 4).\nMethod of the attack—in cases where the attack method is considered sophisticated, chances of the perpetrator publicly claiming credit rather than maintaining silence are 7.8 times lower than in cases of less sophisticated attacks. It appears that perpetrators employing sophisticated methods would tend to maintain silence.\nGIL BARAM\n\n|   | Chances of choosing public denial over silence | Chances of choosing public credit claiming over silence  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  Regime type (democracy) | 0.32 | 11.89**  |\n|   | (0.9) | (0.79)  |\n|  Regime type (anocracy) | 4.13* | 3.12  |\n|   | (0.8) | (1.07)  |\n|  GDP per capita | 0.35* | 0.25*  |\n|   | (0.6) | (0.81)  |\n|  Armed forces personnel (percent) | 0.43 | 1.46  |\n|   | (0.53) | (0.66)  |\n|  Method | 1.77 | 0.12**  |\n|   | (0.6) | (0.62)  |\n|  Severity | 1.29 | 0.54  |\n|   | (0.49) | (1.12)  |\n|  Target type (government) | 0.99 | 0.58  |\n|   | (0.44) | (0.69)  |\n|  Target type (military) | 0.54 | 0.43  |\n|   | (0.53) | (0.79)  |\n|  Third-party involvement | 6.15** | 0.93  |\n|   | (0.63) | (1.18)  |\n|  Discovery time (1 day to 6 months) | 1.66 | 0.69  |\n|   | (0.63) | (0.87)  |\n|  Discovery time (6 months to 1 year) | 0.54 | 0.24  |\n|   | (0.87) | (1.35)  |\n|  Discovery time (1–3 years) | 0.42 | 0.18  |\n|   | (0.85) | (1.33)  |\n|  Discovery time (more than 3 years) | 2.31 | 0.3  |\n|   | (0.75) | (1.33)  |\n|   | x² | df  |\n|   | 77.540 | 26  |\n|   |  | p  |\n|   |  | 0.0001  |\n|  Pseudo-R² |  | 90.2  |\n|  N |  | 317  |\nNotes: The results are presented using odds ratios.

Democracies generally tend to publicly claim credit, while less democratic states tend to choose public denial. When the method of the attack is sophisticated, the chance that the perpetrator exposes the attack and claim credit for it is very low compared to the chance that it maintains silence. When a third party is involved in executing the OCO, the chances of the perpetrator choosing public denial increase greatly (six times more).\n## Defender Strategies\nAfter detecting an OCO, the defender has four possible strategies: full concealment; partial concealment; revealing the attack without attribution; and revealing the attack with public attribution. As seen in figure 4, there is greater variance here than for the perpetrator. In 222 cases (46.6 percent), the defender chose to maintain silence and made no public reference to the attack. However, in 238 cases (50 percent), defenders chose a public strategy that revealed the attack; among them, 108 cases (22.7 percent) were revealed without attribution and 103 (27.3 percent) with public attribution. Of the three public options, partial concealment was the least chosen strategy, taken in only 16 cases (3.4 percent).\nThe Dynamics of Publicity and Secrecy in Offensive Cyber Operations\nTable 3.

With exactly one-half of the cases showing that defenders chose one of the public strategies, it seems that at least as often as not, defenders have an interest in going public.\n## The Defender—Results of the Multinomial Regression\nThe results show in table 3 that the following variables—regime type, GDP per capita, method of the attack, its severity and third-party involvement—impact the chances of the defender choosing a public strategy, whether with or without attribution, rather than choosing silence.\nRegime type—countries with a democratic regime were 6.2 times more likely to both publicly reveal the attack and publicly attribute it to a specific perpetrator than nondemocracies.\nCountries categorized as anocracies were 4.9 times more likely to choose to publicly reveal both the attack and the perpetrator over maintain silence than countries with a different regime type.\nGDP per capita—defenders with a high GDP per capita (&gt;$8,000) were 3.5 times more likely to choose to publicly reveal both the attack and the perpetrator than countries with a lower GDP per capita, and 7 times more likely to reveal the attack without attributing it than countries with lower GDP per capita.\nMethod of the attack—countries attacked by more sophisticated methods were 7 times less likely to publicly reveal both the attack and the perpetrator than countries attacked by less sophisticated methods.\nSeverity—countries that suffered severe attacks causing a considerable degree of damage had a 3.2 higher chance of choosing to publicly reveal both the attack and the perpetrator over choosing silence compared to\nGIL BARAM\n\ncountries that suffered lower severity attacks (p = 0.006). Chances of them choosing partial concealment were even higher—7.3 times more likely than countries that suffered attacks with lower severity.\nThird-party involvement—when a third party was involved in the attack, the chances of the defender choosing to publicly reveal both the attack and the perpetrator over maintaining silence are 3.4 times higher than in cases not involving a third party.\n## Discussion and Conclusions Secrecy is a crucial aspect of OCOs. The use of covert cyber operations allows governments and militaries to achieve their objectives without having to resort to more overt forms of aggression or conflict. However, the secrecy surrounding these operations can also create challenges. For example, it may be difficult for the public to hold government or military actors accountable for their actions in cyberspace if the details of these operations are not transparent.\nThis research note points out the variance in state strategies when deciding how to react after an OCO has taken place and also points out some initial explanations. The main innovation of the study is in demonstrating that countries have an interest in choosing public strategies on OCOs, even though these may often be concealed. In certain cases, the defenders have an interest in exposing the OCOs and sometimes even exposing the perpetrator. Perpetrators sometimes refrain from complete silence and make some form of public comment—denial or credit claiming.\nThe research offers a systematic analysis of the range of strategies and the chances of choosing each. Using variables to quantify and qualify the characteristics of countries (e.g., regime type, economic and military power) and the OCOs (e.g., method, target, third-party involvement) historically involved in cyber conflict over the past two and a half decades allowed an intersectional analysis of which strategies were chosen by whom, and offered initial insights regarding under what conditions.\nThe findings show that the perpetrator's strategy has clear characteristics. While maintaining silence is the preferred strategy, in about one-fifth of the cases the perpetrator prefers to relinquish secrecy by publicly claiming credit or at least publicly denying. The frequency of public strategies is not negligible, and although they do not exceed the frequency of silence, it appears that the perpetrator is often interested in publicly addressing the attacks it has committed.\nWhen the perpetrator was a democracy, there was eleven to twelve times higher chance that it will choose to expose the OCO it has committed and claim credit to itself and not maintain silence. When the perpetrator was not a democracy, there was a four times higher chance that it will choose public denial and not maintain silence.\nIn the strategies of the defender, there is greater variance: in almost half of the cases (46.6 percent), the defender chose to remain silent and not address the OCO publicly. However, in the second half of the cases, it chose public strategies. Publicity is expressed in two ways: exposing the OCO without attribution to a particular perpetrator and exposing it with public attribution. A partial concealment strategy has only come up in less than 4 percent of cases. From the data, it can be seen that in many cases the defender chose to relinquish secrecy and reveal the fact that it was attacked. When the defender was a democracy, there is a five to six times higher chance that it will choose to expose the OCO and the perpetrator. In addition, when it had a high GDP, it is 3.5–4 times more likely to choose to expose the OCO and the perpetrator.\nIn terms of variables related to the OCO itself, it appears that the target type and the involvement of a third party had a significant impact on the likelihood of the The Dynamics of Publicity and Secrecy in Offensive Cyber Operations perpetrator and the defender choosing public strategies. When a third party was involved in carrying out the OCO and when the targets were nonmilitary, the chances increased that countries would choose a public strategy.\nWhen it comes to public strategies, perpetrators with a low level of democracy had a higher chance of choosing public denial or silence, and those with a higher degree of democracy are more likely to self-attribute, that is, claim credit for the OCO. Defenders with a high level of democracy tend to expose the OCO more than nondemocracies.\nWhen it comes to the severity of the OCO, the results were significant for two of the three strategies available to the defender: partial concealment and fully exposing the OCOs with public attribution. Regarding the intermediate strategy of exposing the attack without attribution, the results obtained were not significant. Here, we must bear in mind that extensive damage is often visible and cannot easily be concealed, thereby forcing defenders to take some form of public strategy. But why these specific two of the three options? A possible explanation is that a defender will choose full exposure and public attribution when it can identify the perpetrator with high degree of certainty, and partial concealment, that is, claiming malfunction, when it cannot attribute the attack or does not want to. Therefore, it appears that in cases of obvious damage that cannot be concealed, the intermediate strategy of exposing the attack without exposing the perpetrator carries no significant advantages. Furthermore, when the OCO was carried out by using a more sophisticated method, both perpetrators and defenders had higher chances to remain silent.\nThis study provides initial insights regarding the importance of political characteristics of the countries on either side of OCOs, and in identifying previously unexplored patterns of political action. Moving forward, future research should consider several conditioning variables.\nFirst, how good are the defender's retaliatory options? If they can retaliate, are defenders more likely to publicize, whereas if they cannot retaliate, are they more likely to remain silent? Relatedly, the decision to publicize is conditioned by whether the public would know that something had happened. For example, the UK government could hardly deny that WannaCry (2017) had happened within the United Kingdom, given that most of the National Health System was affected.6 Second, is the decision to publicize conditioned by whether the OCO is exploited for kinetic targets or con fined wholly within cyberspace? Consider Israel's\"Operation Orchard\"(2007), in which Syrian air defenses were reportedly cyberattacked in order to buy time for a kinetic air raid.\nThird, when it comes to regime type distinction, future research should consider several issues: Is it that democracies are some of the most advanced cyber powers, such as the United States, Israel, the United Kingdom, that are driving the results? Alternatively, perhaps democracies are particularly assertive overseas, so the results are effectively showing their wider foreign policy.\n## Supplementary Information Supplementary information is available at the Journal of Global Security Studies ## Acknowledgments The author would like to thank Prof. Isaac Ben Israel, Prof. Udi Sommer and Prof. Yotam Margalit for their insightful comments on an earlier version of this project, and to Eden Poch, Dana Litman, Adi Lotan and Noya Peer for the excellent research assistance.

Over the past few years, however, perpetrators and defenders have publicly acknowledged their involvement in OCOs. How common is this strategic choice among states? What are its characteristics? In this research note I show that this is not a binary choice, and that there is variance in the strategies available to either side. I then examine what state behavior patterns can be identified by using compiled data of OCOs between 1996 and 2019. I show that this phenomenon of giving up secrecy is occurring and point out on states' characteristics and probabilities of choosing each strategy. Initial findings show significant use of public strategies by perpetrators (20 percent) and more so by defenders (50 percent), and that democracies tend toward public credit claiming and attribution, while less democratic countries tend toward public denial. As governments increasingly engage in OCOs, the implications of this research note are of interest to scholars and practitioners alike.\n## Resumen De manera histórica, se ha considerado a las operaciones cibernéticas ofensivas (OCO) como una práctica que los Estados podrían llevar a cabo de manera encubierta, lejos del ojo público, y en la que tanto los perpetradores como los defensores tendrían incentivos para permanecer en silencio. Sin embargo, durante los últimos años han existido tanto perpetradores como defensores que han reconocido públicamente su participación en OCO. ¿Cómo de común es esta elección estratégica entre los Estados? ¿Cuáles son sus características? Demostramos que esta no es una elección binaria, y que existen variaciones en materia de las estrategias disponibles para ambas partes. A continuación, examinamos, mediante el uso de datos recopilados de OCO que tuvieron lugar entre 1996 y 2019, qué patrones de comportamiento por parte de los Estados se pueden identificar. Demostramos que este fenómeno, consistente en renunciar al carácter secreto de las OCO, está teniendo lugar y señalamos tanto las características como las probabilidades de los Estados de elegir cada estrategia. Los hallazgos iniciales muestran un uso significativo de estrategias de carácter público por parte de los perpetradores (20 percent) que es aún mayor por parte de los defensores (50 percent). Los hallazgos iniciales también demuestran que las democracias tienden a autoinculparse de manera pública y a atribuirse a sí mismas la autoría de las OCO, mientras que los países menos democráticos tienden a la negación pública. Debido a que los gobiernos se involucran cada vez más en las OCO, las implicaciones de esta nota de investigación resultan de interés tanto para académicos como para profesionales.\nBaram, Gil (2023) Public Secrets: The Dynamics of Publicity and Secrecy in Offensive Cyber Operations.

Cependant, ces dernières années, tant les responsables que les victimes ont reconnu publiquement leur implication dans des COO. Ce choix stratégique est-il commun chez les États? Quelles en sont les caractéristiques? Je montre qu'il ne s'agit pas d'un choix binaire et qu'il existe différentes stratégies possibles de chaque côté. Ensuite, je m'intéresse aux schémas comportementaux des États que l'on peut identifier à l'aide de données compilées sur des COO entre 1996 et 2019. Je montre qu'abandonner le secret est un phénomène qui existe tout en indiquant les caractéristiques des États et leurs probabilités de choisir chaque stratégie. Les premiers résultats révèlent une utilisation importante des stratégies publiques par les auteurs (20 percent), et encore plus importante par les victimes (50 percent). Ils indiquent aussi que les démocraties favorisent la réclamation et l'attribution publiques de la responsabilité, tandis que les pays moins démocratiques ont tendance à nier publiquement. Comme les gouvernements prennent de plus en plus part à des COO, les implications de cette note de recherche peuvent intéresser autant les chercheurs que les professionnels.\nKeywords: covert actions, cyberattacks, offensive cyber operations Palabras clave: acciones encubiertas, ciberataques, operaciones cibernéticas ofensivas Mots clés: actions secrètes, cyberattaques, cyberopérations offensives # Introduction In July 2020, in a rare public statement of that sort, US President Donald Trump took credit for an offensive cyber operation (OCO) against Russia's Internet Research Agency in St. Petersburg 2 years earlier. This was the first time an American president took credit for an OCO against another nation (Sanger 2020). Is this case of publicly claiming credit for an OCO an exception?\nScholarship suggests that perpetrators and defenders have incentives to keep their OCOs covert and that they might benefit from the advantages of deception (Gartzke and Lindsay 2015; Brantly 2016; Rovner 2021). Yet, the cases where they do decide to go public justify a deeper examination as OCOs are being publicly revealed, discussed, and acknowledged by perpetrators and defenders alike in the past years.\nIn this research note, I show that the decision governments face is not a binary political choice between concealing or revealing the OCO that they were involved in. Rather there is variance in the available strategies,\n\nranging from complete silence to credit claiming for the perpetrator and from complete silence to public attribution for the defender. In this systematic analysis of both sides, I use data to show that this variance exists and how selected characteristics of the defender and perpetrator and of the OCOs themselves correlate with decision to conceal or disclose the operation.\nThis paper proceeds as follows. The first part discusses the role of secrecy and publicity in OCOs and the evolving relationship between the two. It points out on the possible strategies of each side and the variance within them. The second presents the variance in the strategies according to the data and the results of the multinomial regressions examining the variables affecting the chances of both the perpetrator and the defender to choose public strategy over secrecy. The final part discusses the initial findings and their contribution to the understanding of the role of secrecy in OCOs within the broader disciplines of international relations and canvasses future application and research avenues.\nThe nature of OCOs is such that they cannot be fully observed, since an unknown number of them are not revealed. These are the so-called unknown-unknowns, or non-observation cyberattacks and intrusions (Egloff 2020a). These are OCOs assumed to have taken place but not reported and therefore not recorded in the open data sources we used. All cyber-related research trying\nGIL BARAM\nto empirically examine OCOs encounters a form of this problem. For the purposes of this paper, only OCOs that have been publicly revealed and for which there exist sufficient data to code were included (see Online Appendix 1 for details).\n## Secrecy and Publicity in Offensive Cyber Operations\nHistorically, OCOs were considered inherently secret: as General Michael Hayden, former director of the National Security Agency (NSA) and Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), highlighted the degree of secrecy surrounding OCOs: “Even the phrase ‘offensive cyber operations’ was classified. Not what it might mean, or what the targets might be, or what technologies would be involved—merely the phrase itself” (Lin and Zegart 2019, 5).\nThe covertness of OCOs is two-fold, pertaining to both action and actor. First, the OCOs themselves can be kept covert. Unlike kinetic means, some of the technological characteristics of OCOs enable perpetrators to obscure the way in which they were carried out and conceal them from both the defender and the public at large. The second aspect regards the perpetrators, who can conceal their identity and maintain covertness.²\nRecent research discussed the importance of deception in the cyber domain and the challenges it creates for states to distinguish between espionage activities in cyberspace and OCOs (Gartzke and Lindsay 2015; Brantly 2016). Furthermore, it suggests that actors can gain unprecedented strategic advantages in conflict short of war by leveraging the scale, speed, and anonymity of cyberspace (Kello 2017; Buchanan 2020; Maschmeyer 2022).\nOther scholars offer to characterize OCOs as an intelligence contest, with the aim of gaining an advantage in information acquisition. In this context, successful execution of OCOs necessitates limiting the other side’s access to information. National intelligence services are keenly aware of their own susceptibility to espionage and consequently engage in counterintelligence practices to safeguard their digital information (see Chesney and Smeets 2020; Rovner 2021).\nVarious explanations pointed out on the benefits of the use of covert action, ranging from preventing escalation to the ability to signal in secret. These lead to the expectation that countries might prefer to maintain ambiguity or secrecy rather than making a public responses (Lindsay 2015; Carson 2016; Green and Long 2020; Haas and Yarhi-Milo 2021). In addition, secrecy enables leaders to minimize domestic political repercussions, such as facing public backlash for provoking a crisis that may result in an undesirable escalation or for stepping back from a crisis to avoid one (Fearon 1994; Kurizaki 2007).\nAn option of partial concealment exists when full concealment is not possible, such as when an OCO has been revealed by the perpetrator or a third party (Romanosky and Boudreaux 2020), or when the damage caused cannot be concealed. In this case, the defender does not want to admit that an attack has taken place but must acknowledge visible damage, and therefore attributes it to a technical malfunction. Examining this option empirically is difficult, since the defender does not reveal that an attack did in fact occur (Baram and Sommer 2019).\nThere are also some public options for both the perpetrator and the defender. A standing element of covert action is plausible deniability, which can offer the perpetrator an advantage especially when the covert action is a cyberattack. Deniability allows countries to act in the “gray area” without exacerbating the conflict, although it is often clear to domestic and international audiences that covert action has been taken (Cormac and Aldrich 2018; Aldrich and Moran 2019; Poznansky 2020).\nEven when the perpetrator publicly denies involvement, it may or may not have actually carried out the attack attributed to it. Therefore, the key question is if public denial is not perceived as credible, why should states choose this option? This question is further complicated when it comes to OCOs, an arena even more secretive than traditional covert warfare. Therefore, switching to the public option—even if it is a denial and not a public credit claiming—requires an explanation, and literature identifies several (Poznansky 2020). This study identifies the option of public denial as one of the public strategies available to the perpetrator, and examines the possible circumstances in which this strategy might be chosen.\nAnother important aspect of OCOs is attribution, recognized as one of the most difficult problems in the cyber world (Gartzke 2013; Kello 2013; Liff 2013; Rid and Buchanan 2015; Eichensehr 2020; Steffens 2020). Attribution is defined as “determining the identity or location of the perpetrator” (Wheeler and Larsen 2003, 1). The\n² It is important to distinguish between clandestine and covert operations in this context. A covert operation is one that is conducted without the local population and enemy forces being aware of its existence. Clandestine operations are secret operations that are carried out in a manner that conceals the identity of the operator. In Lindsay’s view (Lindsay 2015), the “perfect” covert action would hide both the harm and the person who committed it.\nThe Dynamics of Publicity and Secrecy in Offensive Cyber Operations\nTable 1. Perpetrator and defender's strategies\n|   | Option #1 | Option #2 | Option #3 | Option #4  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  Perpetrator strategy | Full concealment | Public denial | Public credit claiming |   |\n|  Defender strategy | Full concealment | Partial concealment | Publicizing without attribution | Publicizing with public attribution  |\nattribution process involves different aspects, including technical, political, legal, strategic and other components (Lin 2016). There are various techniques for carrying out a process of attributing an OCO, and it often requires a considerable investment of different kinds of resources (Broeders, De Busser, and Pawlak 2020).\nIn the past few years, it seems that state-sponsored OCOs are being publicly attributed to specific state actors and this trend is being discussed theoretically (Egloff 2020b, 2020a). Although this significant development helps position public attribution as a research issue in itself, most studies in the field do not deal with the dynamics between the perpetrator and defender (for exceptions, see Edwards et al. 2017; Schulzke 2018; Baram 2023). It is important to mention that defenders could decide to reveal the fact that they have suffered a cyberattack or intrusion without attributing it to a specific perpetrator.\nRecent discussion regarding voluntary attribution by cyber perpetrators, also described as public credit claiming, maintained that although secrecy is an essential feature of OCOs, some actors choose to publicly claim credit for OCOs they have committed; specifically, this phenomenon is examined among non-state actors (Poznansky and Perkoski 2018).\nThe way in which states perceive and understand risk and uncertainty in cyberspace varies significantly, resulting in a less-than-ideal status quo that contributes to heightened levels of risk and uncertainty (Brantly 2021, 2). When either sides need to decide whether to go public or not, there is a degree of uncertainty: the aggressor is not sure how well its operation has gone. The defender is not quite sure (1) if it has encountered a cyberattack or a technical glitch and (2) how far it has been compromised. These are \"hidden\" possibilities, and therefore hard to study but still worth mentioning.\nBased on this literature, I categorize the following strategies: the perpetrator can chose from (1) full concealment; (2) public denial; and (3) public credit claiming. The defender can chose from (1) full concealment; (2) partial concealment—disclosing damage but denying that it was caused by a deliberate attack (claiming technical malfunctions, system glitches etc.); (3) publicizing the\nOCO without attribution—publicly disclosing that an OCO took place but refraining from publicly identifying the perpetrator; and (4) publicizing the OCO with public attribution—both publicly disclosing that an OCO occurred and publicly attributing it to a specific perpetrator. Table 1 summarizes these strategies. $^3$\nAlthough exposing the OCO and attributing it to a perpetrator might damage the defender's image, this also seems to carry certain benefits as well. As the primary objective of this study was to examine the relationship between states' characteristics and their chosen strategies during cyber conflict, several additional variables are required to be taken into account that are associated with the OCOs themselves: the target that was attacked, the method used, whether a third party was involved, and the severity of the damage caused.\n## Empirical Analysis\nThis section is divided into three parts. First, I discuss the perpetrator and the defender identity and the main countries involved in cyber conflict according to the data. Second, I show variance in the dependent variables, perpetrator strategy and defender strategy, and discuss its meaning and significance. Third, I examine the independent variables—selected factors that might affect perpetrators and defenders' chances for choosing publicity over secrecy.\nMultinomial logistic regression analyses were conducted in order to compare all possible strategies of the perpetrator and the defender, on the assumption that decision-makers consider all available options before choosing, at least at the beginning of the process.\n\nGIL BARAM\n\nFigure 2. The identity of the defenders and the number of OCOs they experienced in 1996–2019.\n# Actors Identity\nPerpetrators identity—figure 1 shows the main attacking countries and the number of OCOs they carried out in the years 1996–2019. The countries that carried out the most OCOs were China (157), Russia (127), Iran (60), North Korea (34), and the United States (32). Non-democratic countries are at the top of the list, but democratic countries—including the United States, Israel, and South Korea—have also carried out OCOs on a significant scale. All the attackers were states, except for cases where the identity of the attacker was unknown (22 cases—4.7 percent of all attacks).\nDefenders identity—figure 2 shows the sixteen most attacked countries and the number of OCOs they experienced in the years 1996–2019. The main defenders were the United States (140), South Korea (26), Ukraine (23), Japan (21), and India (18). Democratic countries seem to be at the top of the list, but non-democratic countries, such as Iran and China, have also experienced many cyberattacks and intrusions as well.⁴\n# Perpetrator Strategies\nThe perpetrator can choose between three possible strategies: maintaining silence, public denial, or claiming credit. Figure 3 illustrates the variance in strategy chosen by attacking countries. In most cases—374, or 78.6 percent—the perpetrators maintained silence. Public denial was chosen in seventy-one cases (15 percent), and\n\nThe Dynamics of Publicity and Secrecy in Offensive Cyber Operations\nFigure 3. Perpetrator strategies.\nin thirty-one cases (6.5 percent) the perpetrators claimed full credit for the attack.\nWhile maintaining silence is the most prevalent strategy, attacking states chose a public strategy in more than 20 percent of cases. Although trailing far behind the most common choice of silence, at one in five OCOs, the prevalence of public strategies is not negligible.\nNow that the variance in perpetrators' strategies has been established, we can turn to test which independent variables affect each kind of strategy. The model described below includes the variables of the regime type, GDP per capita, and the percentage of military force out of the total labor force in the country. The other variables describe the characteristics of the OCO (see Online Appendixes 2 and 3).\n# The Perpetrator—Results of the Multinomial Regression\nOnce we established the variance in attackers' strategies—which includes a meaningful share of public actions—we now turn to test which independent variables affect each kind of strategy. In each model, a comparison is made between the chances that the perpetrator chooses any of the public strategies versus the chance that it would choose to maintain ambiguity.\nThe results in table 2 show that the following variables—regime type, $^{5}$  GDP per capita, method of the attack, and third-party involvement—have an effect on the chances that the perpetrator would choose to claim\n\ncredit for an attack or publicly deny it over choosing silence. For robustness, I used several model specifications (see Online Appendix 4).\nRegime type—among countries with a democratic regime, the chances of publicly claiming credit for an attack rather than maintaining silence are 11.8 times higher than countries that are nondemocracies.\nCountries with anocratic regimes are four times more likely to publicly deny their involvement in the attack than maintain silence compared to countries that are not anocracies.\nGDP per capita—perpetrators with a high GDP per capita ( $&gt;$ 8,000) are 2.8 times less likely to choose public denial over silence than countries with a lower GDP ( $p = 0.04$ ), and even less likely to choose public credit claiming, at 3.9 times less than countries with a lower GDP.\nThis finding warrants a note, as it is not consistent with the results of the other multinomial regressions that followed that show clearly that high GDP countries are in fact more likely to self-attribute and claim credit. This discrepancy is possibly the result of countries where there is a disparity between regime type and GDP and which manifests differently in each regression. This particular result for the GDP variable is an isolated occurrence that does not affect the overall findings (see Online Appendix 4).\nMethod of the attack—in cases where the attack method is considered sophisticated, chances of the perpetrator publicly claiming credit rather than maintaining silence are 7.8 times lower than in cases of less sophisticated attacks. It appears that perpetrators employing sophisticated methods would tend to maintain silence.\nGIL BARAM\n\n|   | Chances of choosing public denial over silence | Chances of choosing public credit claiming over silence  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  Regime type (democracy) | 0.32 | 11.89**  |\n|   | (0.9) | (0.79)  |\n|  Regime type (anocracy) | 4.13* | 3.12  |\n|   | (0.8) | (1.07)  |\n|  GDP per capita | 0.35* | 0.25*  |\n|   | (0.6) | (0.81)  |\n|  Armed forces personnel (percent) | 0.43 | 1.46  |\n|   | (0.53) | (0.66)  |\n|  Method | 1.77 | 0.12**  |\n|   | (0.6) | (0.62)  |\n|  Severity | 1.29 | 0.54  |\n|   | (0.49) | (1.12)  |\n|  Target type (government) | 0.99 | 0.58  |\n|   | (0.44) | (0.69)  |\n|  Target type (military) | 0.54 | 0.43  |\n|   | (0.53) | (0.79)  |\n|  Third-party involvement | 6.15** | 0.93  |\n|   | (0.63) | (1.18)  |\n|  Discovery time (1 day to 6 months) | 1.66 | 0.69  |\n|   | (0.63) | (0.87)  |\n|  Discovery time (6 months to 1 year) | 0.54 | 0.24  |\n|   | (0.87) | (1.35)  |\n|  Discovery time (1–3 years) | 0.42 | 0.18  |\n|   | (0.85) | (1.33)  |\n|  Discovery time (more than 3 years) | 2.31 | 0.3  |\n|   | (0.75) | (1.33)  |\n|   | x² | df  |\n|   | 77.540 | 26  |\n|   |  | p  |\n|   |  | 0.0001  |\n|  Pseudo-R² |  | 90.2  |\n|  N |  | 317  |\nNotes: The results are presented using odds ratios. Standard errors are given in parentheses.\n* p &lt; 0.05, ** p &lt; 0.01, Pearson &lt; 0.0001.\nThird-party involvement—when a third party is involved in the OCO, perpetrators are six times more likely to choose public denial than in cases that do not involve a third party.\nWe can see, therefore, that a country's level of democracy has an impact on its choice of strategy. Democracies generally tend to publicly claim credit, while less democratic states tend to choose public denial. When the method of the attack is sophisticated, the chance that the perpetrator exposes the attack and claim credit for it is very low compared to the chance that it maintains silence. When a third party is involved in executing the OCO, the chances of the perpetrator choosing public denial increase greatly (six times more).\n## Defender Strategies\nAfter detecting an OCO, the defender has four possible strategies: full concealment; partial concealment; revealing the attack without attribution; and revealing the attack with public attribution. As seen in figure 4, there is greater variance here than for the perpetrator. In 222 cases (46.6 percent), the defender chose to maintain silence and made no public reference to the attack. However, in 238 cases (50 percent), defenders chose a public strategy that revealed the attack; among them, 108 cases (22.7 percent) were revealed without attribution and 103 (27.3 percent) with public attribution. Of the three public options, partial concealment was the least chosen strategy, taken in only 16 cases (3.4 percent).\nThe Dynamics of Publicity and Secrecy in Offensive Cyber Operations\nTable 3.

Standard errors are given in parentheses.\n* p &lt; 0.05, ** p &lt; 0.01.\nIf so, then, the data show that maintaining silence is not always the common strategy for defenders. With exactly one-half of the cases showing that defenders chose one of the public strategies, it seems that at least as often as not, defenders have an interest in going public.\n## The Defender—Results of the Multinomial Regression\nThe results show in table 3 that the following variables—regime type, GDP per capita, method of the attack, its severity and third-party involvement—impact the chances of the defender choosing a public strategy, whether with or without attribution, rather than choosing silence.\nRegime type—countries with a democratic regime were 6.2 times more likely to both publicly reveal the attack and publicly attribute it to a specific perpetrator than nondemocracies.\nCountries categorized as anocracies were 4.9 times more likely to choose to publicly reveal both the attack and the perpetrator over maintain silence than countries with a different regime type.\nGDP per capita—defenders with a high GDP per capita (&gt;$8,000) were 3.5 times more likely to choose to publicly reveal both the attack and the perpetrator than countries with a lower GDP per capita, and 7 times more likely to reveal the attack without attributing it than countries with lower GDP per capita.\nMethod of the attack—countries attacked by more sophisticated methods were 7 times less likely to publicly reveal both the attack and the perpetrator than countries attacked by less sophisticated methods.\nSeverity—countries that suffered severe attacks causing a considerable degree of damage had a 3.2 higher chance of choosing to publicly reveal both the attack and the perpetrator over choosing silence compared to\nGIL BARAM\n\ncountries that suffered lower severity attacks (p = 0.006). Chances of them choosing partial concealment were even higher—7.3 times more likely than countries that suffered attacks with lower severity.\nThird-party involvement—when a third party was involved in the attack, the chances of the defender choosing to publicly reveal both the attack and the perpetrator over maintaining silence are 3.4 times higher than in cases not involving a third party.\n## Discussion and Conclusions Secrecy is a crucial aspect of OCOs. The use of covert cyber operations allows governments and militaries to achieve their objectives without having to resort to more overt forms of aggression or conflict. However, the secrecy surrounding these operations can also create challenges. For example, it may be difficult for the public to hold government or military actors accountable for their actions in cyberspace if the details of these operations are not transparent.\nThis research note points out the variance in state strategies when deciding how to react after an OCO has taken place and also points out some initial explanations. The main innovation of the study is in demonstrating that countries have an interest in choosing public strategies on OCOs, even though these may often be concealed. In certain cases, the defenders have an interest in exposing the OCOs and sometimes even exposing the perpetrator. Perpetrators sometimes refrain from complete silence and make some form of public comment—denial or credit claiming.\nThe research offers a systematic analysis of the range of strategies and the chances of choosing each. Using variables to quantify and qualify the characteristics of countries (e.g., regime type, economic and military power) and the OCOs (e.g., method, target, third-party involvement) historically involved in cyber conflict over the past two and a half decades allowed an intersectional analysis of which strategies were chosen by whom, and offered initial insights regarding under what conditions.\nThe findings show that the perpetrator's strategy has clear characteristics. While maintaining silence is the preferred strategy, in about one-fifth of the cases the perpetrator prefers to relinquish secrecy by publicly claiming credit or at least publicly denying. The frequency of public strategies is not negligible, and although they do not exceed the frequency of silence, it appears that the perpetrator is often interested in publicly addressing the attacks it has committed.\nWhen the perpetrator was a democracy, there was eleven to twelve times higher chance that it will choose to expose the OCO it has committed and claim credit to itself and not maintain silence. When the perpetrator was not a democracy, there was a four times higher chance that it will choose public denial and not maintain silence.\nIn the strategies of the defender, there is greater variance: in almost half of the cases (46.6 percent), the defender chose to remain silent and not address the OCO publicly. However, in the second half of the cases, it chose public strategies. Publicity is expressed in two ways: exposing the OCO without attribution to a particular perpetrator and exposing it with public attribution. A partial concealment strategy has only come up in less than 4 percent of cases. From the data, it can be seen that in many cases the defender chose to relinquish secrecy and reveal the fact that it was attacked. When the defender was a democracy, there is a five to six times higher chance that it will choose to expose the OCO and the perpetrator. In addition, when it had a high GDP, it is 3.5–4 times more likely to choose to expose the OCO and the perpetrator.\nIn terms of variables related to the OCO itself, it appears that the target type and the involvement of a third party had a significant impact on the likelihood of the The Dynamics of Publicity and Secrecy in Offensive Cyber Operations perpetrator and the defender choosing public strategies. When a third party was involved in carrying out the OCO and when the targets were nonmilitary, the chances increased that countries would choose a public strategy.\nWhen it comes to public strategies, perpetrators with a low level of democracy had a higher chance of choosing public denial or silence, and those with a higher degree of democracy are more likely to self-attribute, that is, claim credit for the OCO. Defenders with a high level of democracy tend to expose the OCO more than nondemocracies.\nWhen it comes to the severity of the OCO, the results were significant for two of the three strategies available to the defender: partial concealment and fully exposing the OCOs with public attribution. Regarding the intermediate strategy of exposing the attack without attribution, the results obtained were not significant. Here, we must bear in mind that extensive damage is often visible and cannot easily be concealed, thereby forcing defenders to take some form of public strategy. But why these specific two of the three options? A possible explanation is that a defender will choose full exposure and public attribution when it can identify the perpetrator with high degree of certainty, and partial concealment, that is, claiming malfunction, when it cannot attribute the attack or does not want to. Therefore, it appears that in cases of obvious damage that cannot be concealed, the intermediate strategy of exposing the attack without exposing the perpetrator carries no significant advantages. Furthermore, when the OCO was carried out by using a more sophisticated method, both perpetrators and defenders had higher chances to remain silent.\nThis study provides initial insights regarding the importance of political characteristics of the countries on either side of OCOs, and in identifying previously unexplored patterns of political action. Moving forward, future research should consider several conditioning variables.\nFirst, how good are the defender's retaliatory options? If they can retaliate, are defenders more likely to publicize, whereas if they cannot retaliate, are they more likely to remain silent? Relatedly, the decision to publicize is conditioned by whether the public would know that something had happened. For example, the UK government could hardly deny that WannaCry (2017) had happened within the United Kingdom, given that most of the National Health System was affected.6 Second, is the decision to publicize conditioned by whether the OCO is exploited for kinetic targets or con fined wholly within cyberspace? Consider Israel's\"Operation Orchard\"(2007), in which Syrian air defenses were reportedly cyberattacked in order to buy time for a kinetic air raid.\nThird, when it comes to regime type distinction, future research should consider several issues: Is it that democracies are some of the most advanced cyber powers, such as the United States, Israel, the United Kingdom, that are driving the results? Alternatively, perhaps democracies are particularly assertive overseas, so the results are effectively showing their wider foreign policy.\n## Supplementary Information Supplementary information is available at the Journal of Global Security Studies ## Acknowledgments The author would like to thank Prof. Isaac Ben Israel, Prof. Udi Sommer and Prof. Yotam Margalit for their insightful comments on an earlier version of this project, and to Eden Poch, Dana Litman, Adi Lotan and Noya Peer for the excellent research assistance.

Over the past few years, however, perpetrators and defenders have publicly acknowledged their involvement in OCOs. How common is this strategic choice among states? What are its characteristics? In this research note I show that this is not a binary choice, and that there is variance in the strategies available to either side. I then examine what state behavior patterns can be identified by using compiled data of OCOs between 1996 and 2019. I show that this phenomenon of giving up secrecy is occurring and point out on states' characteristics and probabilities of choosing each strategy. Initial findings show significant use of public strategies by perpetrators (20 percent) and more so by defenders (50 percent), and that democracies tend toward public credit claiming and attribution, while less democratic countries tend toward public denial. As governments increasingly engage in OCOs, the implications of this research note are of interest to scholars and practitioners alike.\n## Resumen\nDe manera histórica, se ha considerado a las operaciones cibernéticas ofensivas (OCO) como una práctica que los Estados podrían llevar a cabo de manera encubierta, lejos del ojo público, y en la que tanto los perpetradores como los defensores tendrían incentivos para permanecer en silencio. Sin embargo, durante los últimos años han existido tanto perpetradores como defensores que han reconocido públicamente su participación en OCO. ¿Cómo de común es esta elección estratégica entre los Estados? ¿Cuáles son sus características? Demostramos que esta no es una elección binaria, y que existen variaciones en materia de las estrategias disponibles para ambas partes. A continuación, examinamos, mediante el uso de datos recopilados de OCO que tuvieron lugar entre 1996 y 2019, qué patrones de comportamiento por parte de los Estados se pueden identificar. Demostramos que este fenómeno, consistente en renunciar al carácter secreto de las OCO, está teniendo lugar y señalamos tanto las características como las probabilidades de los Estados de elegir cada estrategia. Los hallazgos iniciales muestran un uso significativo de estrategias de carácter público por parte de los perpetradores (20 percent) que es aún mayor por parte de los defensores (50 percent). Los hallazgos iniciales también demuestran que las democracias tienden a autoinculparse de manera pública y a atribuirse a sí mismas la autoría de las OCO, mientras que los países menos democráticos tienden a la negación pública. Debido a que los gobiernos se involucran cada vez más en las OCO, las implicaciones de esta nota de investigación resultan de interés tanto para académicos como para profesionales.\nBaram, Gil (2023) Public Secrets: The Dynamics of Publicity and Secrecy in Offensive Cyber Operations.

Cependant, ces dernières années, tant les responsables que les victimes ont reconnu publiquement leur implication dans des COO. Ce choix stratégique est-il commun chez les États? Quelles en sont les caractéristiques? Je montre qu'il ne s'agit pas d'un choix binaire et qu'il existe différentes stratégies possibles de chaque côté. Ensuite, je m'intéresse aux schémas comportementaux des États que l'on peut identifier à l'aide de données compilées sur des COO entre 1996 et 2019. Je montre qu'abandonner le secret est un phénomène qui existe tout en indiquant les caractéristiques des États et leurs probabilités de choisir chaque stratégie. Les premiers résultats révèlent une utilisation importante des stratégies publiques par les auteurs (20 percent), et encore plus importante par les victimes (50 percent). Ils indiquent aussi que les démocraties favorisent la réclamation et l'attribution publiques de la responsabilité, tandis que les pays moins démocratiques ont tendance à nier publiquement. Comme les gouvernements prennent de plus en plus part à des COO, les implications de cette note de recherche peuvent intéresser autant les chercheurs que les professionnels.\nKeywords: covert actions, cyberattacks, offensive cyber operations\nPalabras clave: acciones encubiertas, ciberataques, operaciones cibernéticas ofensivas\nMots clés: actions secrètes, cyberattaques, cyberopérations offensives\n# Introduction\nIn July 2020, in a rare public statement of that sort, US President Donald Trump took credit for an offensive cyber operation (OCO) against Russia's Internet Research Agency in St. Petersburg 2 years earlier. This was the first time an American president took credit for an OCO against another nation (Sanger 2020). Is this case of publicly claiming credit for an OCO an exception?\nScholarship suggests that perpetrators and defenders have incentives to keep their OCOs covert and that they might benefit from the advantages of deception (Gartzke and Lindsay 2015; Brantly 2016; Rovner 2021). Yet, the cases where they do decide to go public justify a deeper examination as OCOs are being publicly revealed, discussed, and acknowledged by perpetrators and defenders alike in the past years.\nIn this research note, I show that the decision governments face is not a binary political choice between concealing or revealing the OCO that they were involved in. Rather there is variance in the available strategies,\n1 I use the term offensive cyber operations as it includes espionage and information theft, as well as cyber-enabled information operations, that did not cause physical damage (also known as computer network exploitation [CNE] and computer network influence [CN1] in the technical language).\nranging from complete silence to credit claiming for the perpetrator and from complete silence to public attribution for the defender. In this systematic analysis of both sides, I use data to show that this variance exists and how selected characteristics of the defender and perpetrator and of the OCOs themselves correlate with decision to conceal or disclose the operation.\nThis paper proceeds as follows. The first part discusses the role of secrecy and publicity in OCOs and the evolving relationship between the two. It points out on the possible strategies of each side and the variance within them. The second presents the variance in the strategies according to the data and the results of the multinomial regressions examining the variables affecting the chances of both the perpetrator and the defender to choose public strategy over secrecy. The final part discusses the initial findings and their contribution to the understanding of the role of secrecy in OCOs within the broader disciplines of international relations and canvasses future application and research avenues.\nThe nature of OCOs is such that they cannot be fully observed, since an unknown number of them are not revealed. These are the so-called unknown-unknowns, or non-observation cyberattacks and intrusions (Egloff 2020a). These are OCOs assumed to have taken place but not reported and therefore not recorded in the open data sources we used. All cyber-related research trying\nGIL BARAM\nto empirically examine OCOs encounters a form of this problem. For the purposes of this paper, only OCOs that have been publicly revealed and for which there exist sufficient data to code were included (see Online Appendix 1 for details).\n## Secrecy and Publicity in Offensive Cyber Operations\nHistorically, OCOs were considered inherently secret: as General Michael Hayden, former director of the National Security Agency (NSA) and Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), highlighted the degree of secrecy surrounding OCOs: “Even the phrase ‘offensive cyber operations’ was classified. Not what it might mean, or what the targets might be, or what technologies would be involved—merely the phrase itself” (Lin and Zegart 2019, 5).\nThe covertness of OCOs is two-fold, pertaining to both action and actor. First, the OCOs themselves can be kept covert. Unlike kinetic means, some of the technological characteristics of OCOs enable perpetrators to obscure the way in which they were carried out and conceal them from both the defender and the public at large. The second aspect regards the perpetrators, who can conceal their identity and maintain covertness.²\nRecent research discussed the importance of deception in the cyber domain and the challenges it creates for states to distinguish between espionage activities in cyberspace and OCOs (Gartzke and Lindsay 2015; Brantly 2016). Furthermore, it suggests that actors can gain unprecedented strategic advantages in conflict short of war by leveraging the scale, speed, and anonymity of cyberspace (Kello 2017; Buchanan 2020; Maschmeyer 2022).\nOther scholars offer to characterize OCOs as an intelligence contest, with the aim of gaining an advantage in information acquisition. In this context, successful execution of OCOs necessitates limiting the other side’s access to information. National intelligence services are keenly aware of their own susceptibility to espionage and consequently engage in counterintelligence practices to safeguard their digital information (see Chesney and Smeets 2020; Rovner 2021).\nVarious explanations pointed out on the benefits of the use of covert action, ranging from preventing escalation to the ability to signal in secret. These lead to the expectation that countries might prefer to maintain ambiguity or secrecy rather than making a public responses (Lindsay 2015; Carson 2016; Green and Long 2020; Haas and Yarhi-Milo 2021). In addition, secrecy enables leaders to minimize domestic political repercussions, such as facing public backlash for provoking a crisis that may result in an undesirable escalation or for stepping back from a crisis to avoid one (Fearon 1994; Kurizaki 2007).\nAn option of partial concealment exists when full concealment is not possible, such as when an OCO has been revealed by the perpetrator or a third party (Romanosky and Boudreaux 2020), or when the damage caused cannot be concealed. In this case, the defender does not want to admit that an attack has taken place but must acknowledge visible damage, and therefore attributes it to a technical malfunction. Examining this option empirically is difficult, since the defender does not reveal that an attack did in fact occur (Baram and Sommer 2019).\nThere are also some public options for both the perpetrator and the defender. A standing element of covert action is plausible deniability, which can offer the perpetrator an advantage especially when the covert action is a cyberattack. Deniability allows countries to act in the “gray area” without exacerbating the conflict, although it is often clear to domestic and international audiences that covert action has been taken (Cormac and Aldrich 2018; Aldrich and Moran 2019; Poznansky 2020).\nEven when the perpetrator publicly denies involvement, it may or may not have actually carried out the attack attributed to it. Therefore, the key question is if public denial is not perceived as credible, why should states choose this option? This question is further complicated when it comes to OCOs, an arena even more secretive than traditional covert warfare. Therefore, switching to the public option—even if it is a denial and not a public credit claiming—requires an explanation, and literature identifies several (Poznansky 2020). This study identifies the option of public denial as one of the public strategies available to the perpetrator, and examines the possible circumstances in which this strategy might be chosen.\nAnother important aspect of OCOs is attribution, recognized as one of the most difficult problems in the cyber world (Gartzke 2013; Kello 2013; Liff 2013; Rid and Buchanan 2015; Eichensehr 2020; Steffens 2020). Attribution is defined as “determining the identity or location of the perpetrator” (Wheeler and Larsen 2003, 1). The\n² It is important to distinguish between clandestine and covert operations in this context. A covert operation is one that is conducted without the local population and enemy forces being aware of its existence. Clandestine operations are secret operations that are carried out in a manner that conceals the identity of the operator. In Lindsay’s view (Lindsay 2015), the “perfect” covert action would hide both the harm and the person who committed it.\nThe Dynamics of Publicity and Secrecy in Offensive Cyber Operations\nTable 1. Perpetrator and defender's strategies\n|   | Option #1 | Option #2 | Option #3 | Option #4  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  Perpetrator strategy | Full concealment | Public denial | Public credit claiming |   |\n|  Defender strategy | Full concealment | Partial concealment | Publicizing without attribution | Publicizing with public attribution  |\nattribution process involves different aspects, including technical, political, legal, strategic and other components (Lin 2016). There are various techniques for carrying out a process of attributing an OCO, and it often requires a considerable investment of different kinds of resources (Broeders, De Busser, and Pawlak 2020).\nIn the past few years, it seems that state-sponsored OCOs are being publicly attributed to specific state actors and this trend is being discussed theoretically (Egloff 2020b, 2020a). Although this significant development helps position public attribution as a research issue in itself, most studies in the field do not deal with the dynamics between the perpetrator and defender (for exceptions, see Edwards et al. 2017; Schulzke 2018; Baram 2023). It is important to mention that defenders could decide to reveal the fact that they have suffered a cyberattack or intrusion without attributing it to a specific perpetrator.\nRecent discussion regarding voluntary attribution by cyber perpetrators, also described as public credit claiming, maintained that although secrecy is an essential feature of OCOs, some actors choose to publicly claim credit for OCOs they have committed; specifically, this phenomenon is examined among non-state actors (Poznansky and Perkoski 2018).\nThe way in which states perceive and understand risk and uncertainty in cyberspace varies significantly, resulting in a less-than-ideal status quo that contributes to heightened levels of risk and uncertainty (Brantly 2021, 2). When either sides need to decide whether to go public or not, there is a degree of uncertainty: the aggressor is not sure how well its operation has gone. The defender is not quite sure (1) if it has encountered a cyberattack or a technical glitch and (2) how far it has been compromised. These are \"hidden\" possibilities, and therefore hard to study but still worth mentioning.\nBased on this literature, I categorize the following strategies: the perpetrator can chose from (1) full concealment; (2) public denial; and (3) public credit claiming. The defender can chose from (1) full concealment; (2) partial concealment—disclosing damage but denying that it was caused by a deliberate attack (claiming technical malfunctions, system glitches etc.); (3) publicizing the\nOCO without attribution—publicly disclosing that an OCO took place but refraining from publicly identifying the perpetrator; and (4) publicizing the OCO with public attribution—both publicly disclosing that an OCO occurred and publicly attributing it to a specific perpetrator. Table 1 summarizes these strategies. $^3$\nAlthough exposing the OCO and attributing it to a perpetrator might damage the defender's image, this also seems to carry certain benefits as well. As the primary objective of this study was to examine the relationship between states' characteristics and their chosen strategies during cyber conflict, several additional variables are required to be taken into account that are associated with the OCOs themselves: the target that was attacked, the method used, whether a third party was involved, and the severity of the damage caused.\n## Empirical Analysis\nThis section is divided into three parts. First, I discuss the perpetrator and the defender identity and the main countries involved in cyber conflict according to the data. Second, I show variance in the dependent variables, perpetrator strategy and defender strategy, and discuss its meaning and significance. Third, I examine the independent variables—selected factors that might affect perpetrators and defenders' chances for choosing publicity over secrecy.\nMultinomial logistic regression analyses were conducted in order to compare all possible strategies of the perpetrator and the defender, on the assumption that decision-makers consider all available options before choosing, at least at the beginning of the process.\n3 This variance is wider than only these strategies. Some examples can include sharing information on the attack among elites or with allies, but not with the public; the timing of publicity might change and affect the perpetrator calculations. See Brown and Fazal (2021) on non-denial denials and other kind of \"hidden\" strategies. In addition, it is important to mention the OCOs that would not be detected by the defenders and that the attacker would not report on. As a result, they will not appear in the data.\nGIL BARAM\n5\nFigure 1. The identity of the perpetrators and the number of OCOs they carried out 1996–2019.\nFigure 2. The identity of the defenders and the number of OCOs they experienced in 1996–2019.\n# Actors Identity\nPerpetrators identity—figure 1 shows the main attacking countries and the number of OCOs they carried out in the years 1996–2019. The countries that carried out the most OCOs were China (157), Russia (127), Iran (60), North Korea (34), and the United States (32). Non-democratic countries are at the top of the list, but democratic countries—including the United States, Israel, and South Korea—have also carried out OCOs on a significant scale. All the attackers were states, except for cases where the identity of the attacker was unknown (22 cases—4.7 percent of all attacks).\nDefenders identity—figure 2 shows the sixteen most attacked countries and the number of OCOs they experienced in the years 1996–2019. The main defenders were the United States (140), South Korea (26), Ukraine (23), Japan (21), and India (18). Democratic countries seem to be at the top of the list, but non-democratic countries, such as Iran and China, have also experienced many cyberattacks and intrusions as well.⁴\n# Perpetrator Strategies\nThe perpetrator can choose between three possible strategies: maintaining silence, public denial, or claiming credit. Figure 3 illustrates the variance in strategy chosen by attacking countries. In most cases—374, or 78.6 percent—the perpetrators maintained silence. Public denial was chosen in seventy-one cases (15 percent), and\n4 These data show the prominence of the United States in the context of OCOs, as well as the over-reporting of English resources. This is a known issue in the datasets that this paper is based on and they acknowledge this issue (see Online Appendix 1 for the data compilation procedures). In spite of this, this was the best available data at the time of the analysis, and the results should be interpreted accordingly.\nThe Dynamics of Publicity and Secrecy in Offensive Cyber Operations\nFigure 3. Perpetrator strategies.\nin thirty-one cases (6.5 percent) the perpetrators claimed full credit for the attack.\nWhile maintaining silence is the most prevalent strategy, attacking states chose a public strategy in more than 20 percent of cases. Although trailing far behind the most common choice of silence, at one in five OCOs, the prevalence of public strategies is not negligible.\nNow that the variance in perpetrators' strategies has been established, we can turn to test which independent variables affect each kind of strategy. The model described below includes the variables of the regime type, GDP per capita, and the percentage of military force out of the total labor force in the country. The other variables describe the characteristics of the OCO (see Online Appendixes 2 and 3).\n# The Perpetrator—Results of the Multinomial Regression\nOnce we established the variance in attackers' strategies—which includes a meaningful share of public actions—we now turn to test which independent variables affect each kind of strategy. In each model, a comparison is made between the chances that the perpetrator chooses any of the public strategies versus the chance that it would choose to maintain ambiguity.\nThe results in table 2 show that the following variables—regime type, $^{5}$  GDP per capita, method of the attack, and third-party involvement—have an effect on the chances that the perpetrator would choose to claim\n5 On the relationship between regime type and initiating cyber conflict, see Hunter et al. (2022).\ncredit for an attack or publicly deny it over choosing silence. For robustness, I used several model specifications (see Online Appendix 4).\nRegime type—among countries with a democratic regime, the chances of publicly claiming credit for an attack rather than maintaining silence are 11.8 times higher than countries that are nondemocracies.\nCountries with anocratic regimes are four times more likely to publicly deny their involvement in the attack than maintain silence compared to countries that are not anocracies.\nGDP per capita—perpetrators with a high GDP per capita ( $&gt;$ 8,000) are 2.8 times less likely to choose public denial over silence than countries with a lower GDP ( $p = 0.04$ ), and even less likely to choose public credit claiming, at 3.9 times less than countries with a lower GDP.\nThis finding warrants a note, as it is not consistent with the results of the other multinomial regressions that followed that show clearly that high GDP countries are in fact more likely to self-attribute and claim credit. This discrepancy is possibly the result of countries where there is a disparity between regime type and GDP and which manifests differently in each regression. This particular result for the GDP variable is an isolated occurrence that does not affect the overall findings (see Online Appendix 4).\nMethod of the attack—in cases where the attack method is considered sophisticated, chances of the perpetrator publicly claiming credit rather than maintaining silence are 7.8 times lower than in cases of less sophisticated attacks. It appears that perpetrators employing sophisticated methods would tend to maintain silence.\nGIL BARAM\n7\nTable 2.

Standard errors are given in parentheses.\n* p &lt; 0.05, ** p &lt; 0.01, Pearson &lt; 0.0001.\nThird-party involvement—when a third party is involved in the OCO, perpetrators are six times more likely to choose public denial than in cases that do not involve a third party.\nWe can see, therefore, that a country's level of democracy has an impact on its choice of strategy. Democracies generally tend to publicly claim credit, while less democratic states tend to choose public denial. When the method of the attack is sophisticated, the chance that the perpetrator exposes the attack and claim credit for it is very low compared to the chance that it maintains silence. When a third party is involved in executing the OCO, the chances of the perpetrator choosing public denial increase greatly (six times more).\n## Defender Strategies\nAfter detecting an OCO, the defender has four possible strategies: full concealment; partial concealment; revealing the attack without attribution; and revealing the attack with public attribution. As seen in figure 4, there is greater variance here than for the perpetrator. In 222 cases (46.6 percent), the defender chose to maintain silence and made no public reference to the attack. However, in 238 cases (50 percent), defenders chose a public strategy that revealed the attack; among them, 108 cases (22.7 percent) were revealed without attribution and 103 (27.3 percent) with public attribution. Of the three public options, partial concealment was the least chosen strategy, taken in only 16 cases (3.4 percent).\nThe Dynamics of Publicity and Secrecy in Offensive Cyber Operations\nTable 3.

Standard errors are given in parentheses.\n* p &lt; 0.05, ** p &lt; 0.01.\nIf so, then, the data show that maintaining silence is not always the common strategy for defenders. With exactly one-half of the cases showing that defenders chose one of the public strategies, it seems that at least as often as not, defenders have an interest in going public.\n## The Defender—Results of the Multinomial Regression\nThe results show in table 3 that the following variables—regime type, GDP per capita, method of the attack, its severity and third-party involvement—impact the chances of the defender choosing a public strategy, whether with or without attribution, rather than choosing silence.\nRegime type—countries with a democratic regime were 6.2 times more likely to both publicly reveal the attack and publicly attribute it to a specific perpetrator than nondemocracies.\nCountries categorized as anocracies were 4.9 times more likely to choose to publicly reveal both the attack and the perpetrator over maintain silence than countries with a different regime type.\nGDP per capita—defenders with a high GDP per capita (&gt;$8,000) were 3.5 times more likely to choose to publicly reveal both the attack and the perpetrator than countries with a lower GDP per capita, and 7 times more likely to reveal the attack without attributing it than countries with lower GDP per capita.\nMethod of the attack—countries attacked by more sophisticated methods were 7 times less likely to publicly reveal both the attack and the perpetrator than countries attacked by less sophisticated methods.\nSeverity—countries that suffered severe attacks causing a considerable degree of damage had a 3.2 higher chance of choosing to publicly reveal both the attack and the perpetrator over choosing silence compared to\nGIL BARAM\n9\nFigure 4. Defender strategies.\ncountries that suffered lower severity attacks (p = 0.006). Chances of them choosing partial concealment were even higher—7.3 times more likely than countries that suffered attacks with lower severity.\nThird-party involvement—when a third party was involved in the attack, the chances of the defender choosing to publicly reveal both the attack and the perpetrator over maintaining silence are 3.4 times higher than in cases not involving a third party.\n## Discussion and Conclusions\nSecrecy is a crucial aspect of OCOs. The use of covert cyber operations allows governments and militaries to achieve their objectives without having to resort to more overt forms of aggression or conflict. However, the secrecy surrounding these operations can also create challenges. For example, it may be difficult for the public to hold government or military actors accountable for their actions in cyberspace if the details of these operations are not transparent.\nThis research note points out the variance in state strategies when deciding how to react after an OCO has taken place and also points out some initial explanations. The main innovation of the study is in demonstrating that countries have an interest in choosing public strategies on OCOs, even though these may often be concealed. In certain cases, the defenders have an interest in exposing the OCOs and sometimes even exposing the perpetrator. Perpetrators sometimes refrain from complete silence and make some form of public comment—denial or credit claiming.\nThe research offers a systematic analysis of the range of strategies and the chances of choosing each. Using variables to quantify and qualify the characteristics of countries (e.g., regime type, economic and military power) and the OCOs (e.g., method, target, third-party involvement)\nhistorically involved in cyber conflict over the past two and a half decades allowed an intersectional analysis of which strategies were chosen by whom, and offered initial insights regarding under what conditions.\nThe findings show that the perpetrator's strategy has clear characteristics. While maintaining silence is the preferred strategy, in about one-fifth of the cases the perpetrator prefers to relinquish secrecy by publicly claiming credit or at least publicly denying. The frequency of public strategies is not negligible, and although they do not exceed the frequency of silence, it appears that the perpetrator is often interested in publicly addressing the attacks it has committed.\nWhen the perpetrator was a democracy, there was eleven to twelve times higher chance that it will choose to expose the OCO it has committed and claim credit to itself and not maintain silence. When the perpetrator was not a democracy, there was a four times higher chance that it will choose public denial and not maintain silence.\nIn the strategies of the defender, there is greater variance: in almost half of the cases (46.6 percent), the defender chose to remain silent and not address the OCO publicly. However, in the second half of the cases, it chose public strategies. Publicity is expressed in two ways: exposing the OCO without attribution to a particular perpetrator and exposing it with public attribution. A partial concealment strategy has only come up in less than 4 percent of cases. From the data, it can be seen that in many cases the defender chose to relinquish secrecy and reveal the fact that it was attacked. When the defender was a democracy, there is a five to six times higher chance that it will choose to expose the OCO and the perpetrator. In addition, when it had a high GDP, it is 3.5–4 times more likely to choose to expose the OCO and the perpetrator.\nIn terms of variables related to the OCO itself, it appears that the target type and the involvement of a third party had a significant impact on the likelihood of the\nThe Dynamics of Publicity and Secrecy in Offensive Cyber Operations\nperpetrator and the defender choosing public strategies. When a third party was involved in carrying out the OCO and when the targets were nonmilitary, the chances increased that countries would choose a public strategy.\nWhen it comes to public strategies, perpetrators with a low level of democracy had a higher chance of choosing public denial or silence, and those with a higher degree of democracy are more likely to self-attribute, that is, claim credit for the OCO. Defenders with a high level of democracy tend to expose the OCO more than nondemocracies.\nWhen it comes to the severity of the OCO, the results were significant for two of the three strategies available to the defender: partial concealment and fully exposing the OCOs with public attribution. Regarding the intermediate strategy of exposing the attack without attribution, the results obtained were not significant. Here, we must bear in mind that extensive damage is often visible and cannot easily be concealed, thereby forcing defenders to take some form of public strategy. But why these specific two of the three options? A possible explanation is that a defender will choose full exposure and public attribution when it can identify the perpetrator with high degree of certainty, and partial concealment, that is, claiming malfunction, when it cannot attribute the attack or does not want to. Therefore, it appears that in cases of obvious damage that cannot be concealed, the intermediate strategy of exposing the attack without exposing the perpetrator carries no significant advantages. Furthermore, when the OCO was carried out by using a more sophisticated method, both perpetrators and defenders had higher chances to remain silent.\nThis study provides initial insights regarding the importance of political characteristics of the countries on either side of OCOs, and in identifying previously unexplored patterns of political action. Moving forward, future research should consider several conditioning variables.\nFirst, how good are the defender's retaliatory options? If they can retaliate, are defenders more likely to publicize, whereas if they cannot retaliate, are they more likely to remain silent? Relatedly, the decision to publicize is conditioned by whether the public would know that something had happened.

Over the past few years, however, perpetrators and defenders have publicly acknowledged their involvement in OCOs. How common is this strategic choice among states? What are its characteristics? In this research note I show that this is not a binary choice, and that there is variance in the strategies available to either side. I then examine what state behavior patterns can be identified by using compiled data of OCOs between 1996 and 2019. I show that this phenomenon of giving up secrecy is occurring and point out on states' characteristics and probabilities of choosing each strategy. Initial findings show significant use of public strategies by perpetrators (20 percent) and more so by defenders (50 percent), and that democracies tend toward public credit claiming and attribution, while less democratic countries tend toward public denial. As governments increasingly engage in OCOs, the implications of this research note are of interest to scholars and practitioners alike.\n## Resumen De manera histórica, se ha considerado a las operaciones cibernéticas ofensivas (OCO) como una práctica que los Estados podrían llevar a cabo de manera encubierta, lejos del ojo público, y en la que tanto los perpetradores como los defensores tendrían incentivos para permanecer en silencio. Sin embargo, durante los últimos años han existido tanto perpetradores como defensores que han reconocido públicamente su participación en OCO. ¿Cómo de común es esta elección estratégica entre los Estados? ¿Cuáles son sus características? Demostramos que esta no es una elección binaria, y que existen variaciones en materia de las estrategias disponibles para ambas partes. A continuación, examinamos, mediante el uso de datos recopilados de OCO que tuvieron lugar entre 1996 y 2019, qué patrones de comportamiento por parte de los Estados se pueden identificar. Demostramos que este fenómeno, consistente en renunciar al carácter secreto de las OCO, está teniendo lugar y señalamos tanto las características como las probabilidades de los Estados de elegir cada estrategia. Los hallazgos iniciales muestran un uso significativo de estrategias de carácter público por parte de los perpetradores (20 percent) que es aún mayor por parte de los defensores (50 percent). Los hallazgos iniciales también demuestran que las democracias tienden a autoinculparse de manera pública y a atribuirse a sí mismas la autoría de las OCO, mientras que los países menos democráticos tienden a la negación pública. Debido a que los gobiernos se involucran cada vez más en las OCO, las implicaciones de esta nota de investigación resultan de interés tanto para académicos como para profesionales.\nBaram, Gil (2023) Public Secrets: The Dynamics of Publicity and Secrecy in Offensive Cyber Operations.

Cependant, ces dernières années, tant les responsables que les victimes ont reconnu publiquement leur implication dans des COO. Ce choix stratégique est-il commun chez les États? Quelles en sont les caractéristiques? Je montre qu'il ne s'agit pas d'un choix binaire et qu'il existe différentes stratégies possibles de chaque côté. Ensuite, je m'intéresse aux schémas comportementaux des États que l'on peut identifier à l'aide de données compilées sur des COO entre 1996 et 2019. Je montre qu'abandonner le secret est un phénomène qui existe tout en indiquant les caractéristiques des États et leurs probabilités de choisir chaque stratégie. Les premiers résultats révèlent une utilisation importante des stratégies publiques par les auteurs (20 percent), et encore plus importante par les victimes (50 percent). Ils indiquent aussi que les démocraties favorisent la réclamation et l'attribution publiques de la responsabilité, tandis que les pays moins démocratiques ont tendance à nier publiquement. Comme les gouvernements prennent de plus en plus part à des COO, les implications de cette note de recherche peuvent intéresser autant les chercheurs que les professionnels.\nKeywords: covert actions, cyberattacks, offensive cyber operations Palabras clave: acciones encubiertas, ciberataques, operaciones cibernéticas ofensivas Mots clés: actions secrètes, cyberattaques, cyberopérations offensives # Introduction In July 2020, in a rare public statement of that sort, US President Donald Trump took credit for an offensive cyber operation (OCO) against Russia's Internet Research Agency in St. Petersburg 2 years earlier. This was the first time an American president took credit for an OCO against another nation. Is this case of publicly claiming credit for an OCO an exception?\nScholarship suggests that perpetrators and defenders have incentives to keep their OCOs covert and that they might benefit from the advantages of deception. Yet, the cases where they do decide to go public justify a deeper examination as OCOs are being publicly revealed, discussed, and acknowledged by perpetrators and defenders alike in the past years.\nIn this research note, I show that the decision governments face is not a binary political choice between concealing or revealing the OCO that they were involved in. Rather there is variance in the available strategies,\n\nranging from complete silence to credit claiming for the perpetrator and from complete silence to public attribution for the defender. In this systematic analysis of both sides, I use data to show that this variance exists and how selected characteristics of the defender and perpetrator and of the OCOs themselves correlate with decision to conceal or disclose the operation.\nThis paper proceeds as follows. The first part discusses the role of secrecy and publicity in OCOs and the evolving relationship between the two. It points out on the possible strategies of each side and the variance within them. The second presents the variance in the strategies according to the data and the results of the multinomial regressions examining the variables affecting the chances of both the perpetrator and the defender to choose public strategy over secrecy. The final part discusses the initial findings and their contribution to the understanding of the role of secrecy in OCOs within the broader disciplines of international relations and canvasses future application and research avenues.\nThe nature of OCOs is such that they cannot be fully observed, since an unknown number of them are not revealed. These are the so-called unknown-unknowns, or non-observation cyberattacks and intrusions . These are OCOs assumed to have taken place but not reported and therefore not recorded in the open data sources we used. All cyber-related research trying\nGIL BARAM\nto empirically examine OCOs encounters a form of this problem. For the purposes of this paper, only OCOs that have been publicly revealed and for which there exist sufficient data to code were included (see Online Appendix 1 for details).\n## Secrecy and Publicity in Offensive Cyber Operations\nHistorically, OCOs were considered inherently secret: as General Michael Hayden, former director of the National Security Agency (NSA) and Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), highlighted the degree of secrecy surrounding OCOs: “Even the phrase ‘offensive cyber operations’ was classified. Not what it might mean, or what the targets might be, or what technologies would be involved—merely the phrase itself” .\nThe covertness of OCOs is two-fold, pertaining to both action and actor. First, the OCOs themselves can be kept covert. Unlike kinetic means, some of the technological characteristics of OCOs enable perpetrators to obscure the way in which they were carried out and conceal them from both the defender and the public at large. The second aspect regards the perpetrators, who can conceal their identity and maintain covertness.²\nRecent research discussed the importance of deception in the cyber domain and the challenges it creates for states to distinguish between espionage activities in cyberspace and OCOs . Furthermore, it suggests that actors can gain unprecedented strategic advantages in conflict short of war by leveraging the scale, speed, and anonymity of cyberspace .\nOther scholars offer to characterize OCOs as an intelligence contest, with the aim of gaining an advantage in information acquisition. In this context, successful execution of OCOs necessitates limiting the other side’s access to information. National intelligence services are keenly aware of their own susceptibility to espionage and consequently engage in counterintelligence practices to safeguard their digital information (see Chesney and Smeets 2020; Rovner 2021).\nVarious explanations pointed out on the benefits of the use of covert action, ranging from preventing escalation to the ability to signal in secret. These lead to the expectation that countries might prefer to maintain ambiguity or secrecy rather than making a public responses . In addition, secrecy enables leaders to minimize domestic political repercussions, such as facing public backlash for provoking a crisis that may result in an undesirable escalation or for stepping back from a crisis to avoid one .\nAn option of partial concealment exists when full concealment is not possible, such as when an OCO has been revealed by the perpetrator or a third party , or when the damage caused cannot be concealed. In this case, the defender does not want to admit that an attack has taken place but must acknowledge visible damage, and therefore attributes it to a technical malfunction. Examining this option empirically is difficult, since the defender does not reveal that an attack did in fact occur .\nThere are also some public options for both the perpetrator and the defender. A standing element of covert action is plausible deniability, which can offer the perpetrator an advantage especially when the covert action is a cyberattack. Deniability allows countries to act in the “gray area” without exacerbating the conflict, although it is often clear to domestic and international audiences that covert action has been taken .\nEven when the perpetrator publicly denies involvement, it may or may not have actually carried out the attack attributed to it. Therefore, the key question is if public denial is not perceived as credible, why should states choose this option? This question is further complicated when it comes to OCOs, an arena even more secretive than traditional covert warfare. Therefore, switching to the public option—even if it is a denial and not a public credit claiming—requires an explanation, and literature identifies several . This study identifies the option of public denial as one of the public strategies available to the perpetrator, and examines the possible circumstances in which this strategy might be chosen.\nAnother important aspect of OCOs is attribution, recognized as one of the most difficult problems in the cyber world . Attribution is defined as “determining the identity or location of the perpetrator” . The\n² It is important to distinguish between clandestine and covert operations in this context. A covert operation is one that is conducted without the local population and enemy forces being aware of its existence. Clandestine operations are secret operations that are carried out in a manner that conceals the identity of the operator. In Lindsay’s view , the “perfect” covert action would hide both the harm and the person who committed it.\nThe Dynamics of Publicity and Secrecy in Offensive Cyber Operations\nTable 1. Perpetrator and defender's strategies\n|   | Option #1 | Option #2 | Option #3 | Option #4  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  Perpetrator strategy | Full concealment | Public denial | Public credit claiming |   |\n|  Defender strategy | Full concealment | Partial concealment | Publicizing without attribution | Publicizing with public attribution  |\nattribution process involves different aspects, including technical, political, legal, strategic and other components . There are various techniques for carrying out a process of attributing an OCO, and it often requires a considerable investment of different kinds of resources (Broeders, De Busser, and Pawlak 2020).\nIn the past few years, it seems that state-sponsored OCOs are being publicly attributed to specific state actors and this trend is being discussed theoretically . Although this significant development helps position public attribution as a research issue in itself, most studies in the field do not deal with the dynamics between the perpetrator and defender (for exceptions, see Edwards et al. 2017; Schulzke 2018; Baram 2023). It is important to mention that defenders could decide to reveal the fact that they have suffered a cyberattack or intrusion without attributing it to a specific perpetrator.\nRecent discussion regarding voluntary attribution by cyber perpetrators, also described as public credit claiming, maintained that although secrecy is an essential feature of OCOs, some actors choose to publicly claim credit for OCOs they have committed; specifically, this phenomenon is examined among non-state actors .\nThe way in which states perceive and understand risk and uncertainty in cyberspace varies significantly, resulting in a less-than-ideal status quo that contributes to heightened levels of risk and uncertainty . When either sides need to decide whether to go public or not, there is a degree of uncertainty: the aggressor is not sure how well its operation has gone. The defender is not quite sure (1) if it has encountered a cyberattack or a technical glitch and (2) how far it has been compromised. These are \"hidden\" possibilities, and therefore hard to study but still worth mentioning.\nBased on this literature, I categorize the following strategies: the perpetrator can chose from (1) full concealment; (2) public denial; and (3) public credit claiming. The defender can chose from (1) full concealment; (2) partial concealment—disclosing damage but denying that it was caused by a deliberate attack (claiming technical malfunctions, system glitches etc.); (3) publicizing the\nOCO without attribution—publicly disclosing that an OCO took place but refraining from publicly identifying the perpetrator; and (4) publicizing the OCO with public attribution—both publicly disclosing that an OCO occurred and publicly attributing it to a specific perpetrator. Table 1 summarizes these strategies. $^3$\nAlthough exposing the OCO and attributing it to a perpetrator might damage the defender's image, this also seems to carry certain benefits as well. As the primary objective of this study was to examine the relationship between states' characteristics and their chosen strategies during cyber conflict, several additional variables are required to be taken into account that are associated with the OCOs themselves: the target that was attacked, the method used, whether a third party was involved, and the severity of the damage caused.\n## Empirical Analysis\nThis section is divided into three parts. First, I discuss the perpetrator and the defender identity and the main countries involved in cyber conflict according to the data. Second, I show variance in the dependent variables, perpetrator strategy and defender strategy, and discuss its meaning and significance. Third, I examine the independent variables—selected factors that might affect perpetrators and defenders' chances for choosing publicity over secrecy.\nMultinomial logistic regression analyses were conducted in order to compare all possible strategies of the perpetrator and the defender, on the assumption that decision-makers consider all available options before choosing, at least at the beginning of the process.\n\nGIL BARAM\n\nFigure 2. The identity of the defenders and the number of OCOs they experienced in 1996–2019.\n# Actors Identity\nPerpetrators identity—figure 1 shows the main attacking countries and the number of OCOs they carried out in the years 1996–2019. The countries that carried out the most OCOs were China (157), Russia (127), Iran (60), North Korea (34), and the United States (32). Non-democratic countries are at the top of the list, but democratic countries—including the United States, Israel, and South Korea—have also carried out OCOs on a significant scale. All the attackers were states, except for cases where the identity of the attacker was unknown (22 cases—4.7 percent of all attacks).\nDefenders identity—figure 2 shows the sixteen most attacked countries and the number of OCOs they experienced in the years 1996–2019. The main defenders were the United States (140), South Korea (26), Ukraine (23), Japan (21), and India (18). Democratic countries seem to be at the top of the list, but non-democratic countries, such as Iran and China, have also experienced many cyberattacks and intrusions as well.⁴\n# Perpetrator Strategies\nThe perpetrator can choose between three possible strategies: maintaining silence, public denial, or claiming credit. Figure 3 illustrates the variance in strategy chosen by attacking countries. In most cases—374, or 78.6 percent—the perpetrators maintained silence. Public denial was chosen in seventy-one cases (15 percent), and\n\nThe Dynamics of Publicity and Secrecy in Offensive Cyber Operations\nFigure 3. Perpetrator strategies.\nin thirty-one cases (6.5 percent) the perpetrators claimed full credit for the attack.\nWhile maintaining silence is the most prevalent strategy, attacking states chose a public strategy in more than 20 percent of cases. Although trailing far behind the most common choice of silence, at one in five OCOs, the prevalence of public strategies is not negligible.\nNow that the variance in perpetrators' strategies has been established, we can turn to test which independent variables affect each kind of strategy. The model described below includes the variables of the regime type, GDP per capita, and the percentage of military force out of the total labor force in the country. The other variables describe the characteristics of the OCO (see Online Appendixes 2 and 3).\n# The Perpetrator—Results of the Multinomial Regression\nOnce we established the variance in attackers' strategies—which includes a meaningful share of public actions—we now turn to test which independent variables affect each kind of strategy. In each model, a comparison is made between the chances that the perpetrator chooses any of the public strategies versus the chance that it would choose to maintain ambiguity.\nThe results in table 2 show that the following variables—regime type, $^{5}$  GDP per capita, method of the attack, and third-party involvement—have an effect on the chances that the perpetrator would choose to claim\n\ncredit for an attack or publicly deny it over choosing silence. For robustness, I used several model specifications (see Online Appendix 4).\nRegime type—among countries with a democratic regime, the chances of publicly claiming credit for an attack rather than maintaining silence are 11.8 times higher than countries that are nondemocracies.\nCountries with anocratic regimes are four times more likely to publicly deny their involvement in the attack than maintain silence compared to countries that are not anocracies.\nGDP per capita—perpetrators with a high GDP per capita ( $&gt;$ 8,000) are 2.8 times less likely to choose public denial over silence than countries with a lower GDP ( $p = 0.04$ ), and even less likely to choose public credit claiming, at 3.9 times less than countries with a lower GDP.\nThis finding warrants a note, as it is not consistent with the results of the other multinomial regressions that followed that show clearly that high GDP countries are in fact more likely to self-attribute and claim credit. This discrepancy is possibly the result of countries where there is a disparity between regime type and GDP and which manifests differently in each regression. This particular result for the GDP variable is an isolated occurrence that does not affect the overall findings (see Online Appendix 4).\nMethod of the attack—in cases where the attack method is considered sophisticated, chances of the perpetrator publicly claiming credit rather than maintaining silence are 7.8 times lower than in cases of less sophisticated attacks. It appears that perpetrators employing sophisticated methods would tend to maintain silence.\nGIL BARAM\n\n|   | Chances of choosing public denial over silence | Chances of choosing public credit claiming over silence  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  Regime type (democracy) | 0.32 | 11.89**  |\n|   | (0.9) | (0.79)  |\n|  Regime type (anocracy) | 4.13* | 3.12  |\n|   | (0.8) | (1.07)  |\n|  GDP per capita | 0.35* | 0.25*  |\n|   | (0.6) | (0.81)  |\n|  Armed forces personnel (percent) | 0.43 | 1.46  |\n|   | (0.53) | (0.66)  |\n|  Method | 1.77 | 0.12**  |\n|   | (0.6) | (0.62)  |\n|  Severity | 1.29 | 0.54  |\n|   | (0.49) | (1.12)  |\n|  Target type (government) | 0.99 | 0.58  |\n|   | (0.44) | (0.69)  |\n|  Target type (military) | 0.54 | 0.43  |\n|   | (0.53) | (0.79)  |\n|  Third-party involvement | 6.15** | 0.93  |\n|   | (0.63) | (1.18)  |\n|  Discovery time (1 day to 6 months) | 1.66 | 0.69  |\n|   | (0.63) | (0.87)  |\n|  Discovery time (6 months to 1 year) | 0.54 | 0.24  |\n|   | (0.87) | (1.35)  |\n|  Discovery time (1–3 years) | 0.42 | 0.18  |\n|   | (0.85) | (1.33)  |\n|  Discovery time (more than 3 years) | 2.31 | 0.3  |\n|   | (0.75) | (1.33)  |\n|   | x² | df  |\n|   | 77.540 | 26  |\n|   |  | p  |\n|   |  | 0.0001  |\n|  Pseudo-R² |  | 90.2  |\n|  N |  | 317  |\nNotes: The results are presented using odds ratios. Standard errors are given in parentheses.\n* p &lt; 0.05, ** p &lt; 0.01, Pearson &lt; 0.0001.\nThird-party involvement—when a third party is involved in the OCO, perpetrators are six times more likely to choose public denial than in cases that do not involve a third party.\nWe can see, therefore, that a country's level of democracy has an impact on its choice of strategy. Democracies generally tend to publicly claim credit, while less democratic states tend to choose public denial. When the method of the attack is sophisticated, the chance that the perpetrator exposes the attack and claim credit for it is very low compared to the chance that it maintains silence. When a third party is involved in executing the OCO, the chances of the perpetrator choosing public denial increase greatly (six times more).\n## Defender Strategies\nAfter detecting an OCO, the defender has four possible strategies: full concealment; partial concealment; revealing the attack without attribution; and revealing the attack with public attribution. As seen in figure 4, there is greater variance here than for the perpetrator. In 222 cases (46.6 percent), the defender chose to maintain silence and made no public reference to the attack. However, in 238 cases (50 percent), defenders chose a public strategy that revealed the attack; among them, 108 cases (22.7 percent) were revealed without attribution and 103 (27.3 percent) with public attribution. Of the three public options, partial concealment was the least chosen strategy, taken in only 16 cases (3.4 percent).\nThe Dynamics of Publicity and Secrecy in Offensive Cyber Operations\nTable 3.

With exactly one-half of the cases showing that defenders chose one of the public strategies, it seems that at least as often as not, defenders have an interest in going public.\n## The Defender—Results of the Multinomial Regression\nThe results show in table 3 that the following variables—regime type, GDP per capita, method of the attack, its severity and third-party involvement—impact the chances of the defender choosing a public strategy, whether with or without attribution, rather than choosing silence.\nRegime type—countries with a democratic regime were 6.2 times more likely to both publicly reveal the attack and publicly attribute it to a specific perpetrator than nondemocracies.\nCountries categorized as anocracies were 4.9 times more likely to choose to publicly reveal both the attack and the perpetrator over maintain silence than countries with a different regime type.\nGDP per capita—defenders with a high GDP per capita (&gt;$8,000) were 3.5 times more likely to choose to publicly reveal both the attack and the perpetrator than countries with a lower GDP per capita, and 7 times more likely to reveal the attack without attributing it than countries with lower GDP per capita.\nMethod of the attack—countries attacked by more sophisticated methods were 7 times less likely to publicly reveal both the attack and the perpetrator than countries attacked by less sophisticated methods.\nSeverity—countries that suffered severe attacks causing a considerable degree of damage had a 3.2 higher chance of choosing to publicly reveal both the attack and the perpetrator over choosing silence compared to\nGIL BARAM\n\ncountries that suffered lower severity attacks (p = 0.006). Chances of them choosing partial concealment were even higher—7.3 times more likely than countries that suffered attacks with lower severity.\nThird-party involvement—when a third party was involved in the attack, the chances of the defender choosing to publicly reveal both the attack and the perpetrator over maintaining silence are 3.4 times higher than in cases not involving a third party.\n## Discussion and Conclusions Secrecy is a crucial aspect of OCOs. The use of covert cyber operations allows governments and militaries to achieve their objectives without having to resort to more overt forms of aggression or conflict. However, the secrecy surrounding these operations can also create challenges. For example, it may be difficult for the public to hold government or military actors accountable for their actions in cyberspace if the details of these operations are not transparent.\nThis research note points out the variance in state strategies when deciding how to react after an OCO has taken place and also points out some initial explanations. The main innovation of the study is in demonstrating that countries have an interest in choosing public strategies on OCOs, even though these may often be concealed. In certain cases, the defenders have an interest in exposing the OCOs and sometimes even exposing the perpetrator. Perpetrators sometimes refrain from complete silence and make some form of public comment—denial or credit claiming.\nThe research offers a systematic analysis of the range of strategies and the chances of choosing each. Using variables to quantify and qualify the characteristics of countries (e.g., regime type, economic and military power) and the OCOs (e.g., method, target, third-party involvement) historically involved in cyber conflict over the past two and a half decades allowed an intersectional analysis of which strategies were chosen by whom, and offered initial insights regarding under what conditions.\nThe findings show that the perpetrator's strategy has clear characteristics. While maintaining silence is the preferred strategy, in about one-fifth of the cases the perpetrator prefers to relinquish secrecy by publicly claiming credit or at least publicly denying. The frequency of public strategies is not negligible, and although they do not exceed the frequency of silence, it appears that the perpetrator is often interested in publicly addressing the attacks it has committed.\nWhen the perpetrator was a democracy, there was eleven to twelve times higher chance that it will choose to expose the OCO it has committed and claim credit to itself and not maintain silence. When the perpetrator was not a democracy, there was a four times higher chance that it will choose public denial and not maintain silence.\nIn the strategies of the defender, there is greater variance: in almost half of the cases (46.6 percent), the defender chose to remain silent and not address the OCO publicly. However, in the second half of the cases, it chose public strategies. Publicity is expressed in two ways: exposing the OCO without attribution to a particular perpetrator and exposing it with public attribution. A partial concealment strategy has only come up in less than 4 percent of cases. From the data, it can be seen that in many cases the defender chose to relinquish secrecy and reveal the fact that it was attacked. When the defender was a democracy, there is a five to six times higher chance that it will choose to expose the OCO and the perpetrator. In addition, when it had a high GDP, it is 3.5–4 times more likely to choose to expose the OCO and the perpetrator.\nIn terms of variables related to the OCO itself, it appears that the target type and the involvement of a third party had a significant impact on the likelihood of the The Dynamics of Publicity and Secrecy in Offensive Cyber Operations perpetrator and the defender choosing public strategies. When a third party was involved in carrying out the OCO and when the targets were nonmilitary, the chances increased that countries would choose a public strategy.\nWhen it comes to public strategies, perpetrators with a low level of democracy had a higher chance of choosing public denial or silence, and those with a higher degree of democracy are more likely to self-attribute, that is, claim credit for the OCO. Defenders with a high level of democracy tend to expose the OCO more than nondemocracies.\nWhen it comes to the severity of the OCO, the results were significant for two of the three strategies available to the defender: partial concealment and fully exposing the OCOs with public attribution. Regarding the intermediate strategy of exposing the attack without attribution, the results obtained were not significant. Here, we must bear in mind that extensive damage is often visible and cannot easily be concealed, thereby forcing defenders to take some form of public strategy. But why these specific two of the three options? A possible explanation is that a defender will choose full exposure and public attribution when it can identify the perpetrator with high degree of certainty, and partial concealment, that is, claiming malfunction, when it cannot attribute the attack or does not want to. Therefore, it appears that in cases of obvious damage that cannot be concealed, the intermediate strategy of exposing the attack without exposing the perpetrator carries no significant advantages. Furthermore, when the OCO was carried out by using a more sophisticated method, both perpetrators and defenders had higher chances to remain silent.\nThis study provides initial insights regarding the importance of political characteristics of the countries on either side of OCOs, and in identifying previously unexplored patterns of political action. Moving forward, future research should consider several conditioning variables.\nFirst, how good are the defender's retaliatory options? If they can retaliate, are defenders more likely to publicize, whereas if they cannot retaliate, are they more likely to remain silent? Relatedly, the decision to publicize is conditioned by whether the public would know that something had happened. For example, the UK government could hardly deny that WannaCry (2017) had happened within the United Kingdom, given that most of the National Health System was affected.6 Second, is the decision to publicize conditioned by whether the OCO is exploited for kinetic targets or con fined wholly within cyberspace? Consider Israel's\"Operation Orchard\"(2007), in which Syrian air defenses were reportedly cyberattacked in order to buy time for a kinetic air raid.\nThird, when it comes to regime type distinction, future research should consider several issues: Is it that democracies are some of the most advanced cyber powers, such as the United States, Israel, the United Kingdom, that are driving the results? Alternatively, perhaps democracies are particularly assertive overseas, so the results are effectively showing their wider foreign policy.\n## Supplementary Information Supplementary information is available at the Journal of Global Security Studies ## Acknowledgments The author would like to thank Prof. Isaac Ben Israel, Prof. Udi Sommer and Prof. Yotam Margalit for their insightful comments on an earlier version of this project, and to Eden Poch, Dana Litman, Adi Lotan and Noya Peer for the excellent research assistance.

A continuación, examinamos, mediante el uso de datos recopilados de OCO que tuvieron lugar entre 1996 y 2019, qué patrones de comportamiento por parte de los Estados se pueden identificar. Demostramos que este fenómeno, consistente en renunciar al carácter secreto de las OCO, está teniendo lugar y señalamos tanto las características como las probabilidades de los Estados de elegir cada estrategia. Los hallazgos iniciales muestran un uso significativo de estrategias de carácter público por parte de los perpetradores (20 percent) que es aún mayor por parte de los defensores (50 percent). Los hallazgos iniciales también demuestran que las democracias tienden a autoinculparse de manera pública y a atribuirse a sí mismas la autoría de las OCO, mientras que los países menos democráticos tienden a la negación pública. Debido a que los gobiernos se involucran cada vez más en las OCO, las implicaciones de esta nota de investigación resultan de interés tanto para académicos como para profesionales.\n\nBaram, Gil (2023) Public Secrets: The Dynamics of Publicity and Secrecy in Offensive Cyber Operations.

    "The Dynamics of Publicity and Secrecy in Offensive Cyber Operations\n\n# Résumé\n\nHistoriquement, on considère les cyberopérations offensives (COO) comme des actions que les États peuvent mener secrètement, à l'abri des regards extérieurs, les responsables et les victimes ayant tous deux intérêt à garder le silence. Cependant, ces dernières années, tant les responsables que les victimes ont reconnu publiquement leur implication dans des COO. Ce choix stratégique est-il commun chez les États? Quelles en sont les caractéristiques? Je montre qu'il ne s'agit pas d'un choix binaire et qu'il existe différentes stratégies possibles de chaque côté. Ensuite, je m'intéresse aux schémas comportementaux des États que l'on peut identifier à l'aide de données compilées sur des COO entre 1996 et 2019. Je montre qu'abandonner le secret est un phénomène qui existe tout en indiquant les caractéristiques des États et leurs probabilités de choisir chaque stratégie. Les premiers résultats révèlent une utilisation importante des stratégies publiques par les auteurs (20 percent), et encore plus importante par les victimes (50 percent). Ils indiquent aussi que les démocraties favorisent la réclamation et l'attribution publiques de la responsabilité, tandis que les pays moins démocratiques ont tendance à nier publiquement. Comme les gouvernements prennent de plus en plus part à des COO, les implications de cette note de recherche peuvent intéresser autant les chercheurs que les professionnels.\n\nKeywords: covert actions, cyberattacks, offensive cyber operations\n\nPalabras clave: acciones encubiertas, ciberataques, operaciones cibernéticas ofensivas\n\nMots clés: actions secrètes, cyberattaques, cyberopérations offensives\n\n# Introduction\n\nIn July 2020, in a rare public statement of that sort, US President Donald Trump took credit for an offensive cyber operation (OCO) against Russia's Internet Research Agency in St. Petersburg 2 years earlier. This was the first time an American president took credit for an OCO against another nation (Sanger 2020). Is this case of publicly claiming credit for an OCO an exception?\n\nScholarship suggests that perpetrators and defenders have incentives to keep their OCOs covert and that they might benefit from the advantages of deception (Gartzke and Lindsay 2015; Brantly 2016; Rovner 2021). Yet, the cases where they do decide to go public justify a deeper examination as OCOs are being publicly revealed, discussed, and acknowledged by perpetrators and defenders alike in the past years.\n\nIn this research note, I show that the decision governments face is not a binary political choice between concealing or revealing the OCO that they were involved in. Rather there is variance in the available strategies,\n\n1 I use the term offensive cyber operations as it includes espionage and information theft, as well as cyber-enabled information operations, that did not cause physical damage (also known as computer network exploitation [CNE] and computer network influence [CN1] in the technical language).\n\nranging from complete silence to credit claiming for the perpetrator and from complete silence to public attribution for the defender. In this systematic analysis of both sides, I use data to show that this variance exists and how selected characteristics of the defender and perpetrator and of the OCOs themselves correlate with decision to conceal or disclose the operation.\n\nThis paper proceeds as follows. The first part discusses the role of secrecy and publicity in OCOs and the evolving relationship between the two. It points out on the possible strategies of each side and the variance within them. The second presents the variance in the strategies according to the data and the results of the multinomial regressions examining the variables affecting the chances of both the perpetrator and the defender to choose public strategy over secrecy. The final part discusses the initial findings and their contribution to the understanding of the role of secrecy in OCOs within the broader disciplines of international relations and canvasses future application and research avenues.\n\nThe nature of OCOs is such that they cannot be fully observed, since an unknown number of them are not revealed. These are the so-called unknown-unknowns, or non-observation cyberattacks and intrusions (Egloff 2020a). These are OCOs assumed to have taken place but not reported and therefore not recorded in the open data sources we used. All cyber-related research trying",
    "GIL BARAM\n\nto empirically examine OCOs encounters a form of this problem. For the purposes of this paper, only OCOs that have been publicly revealed and for which there exist sufficient data to code were included (see Online Appendix 1 for details).\n\n## Secrecy and Publicity in Offensive Cyber Operations\n\nHistorically, OCOs were considered inherently secret: as General Michael Hayden, former director of the National Security Agency (NSA) and Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), highlighted the degree of secrecy surrounding OCOs: “Even the phrase ‘offensive cyber operations’ was classified. Not what it might mean, or what the targets might be, or what technologies would be involved—merely the phrase itself” (Lin and Zegart 2019, 5).\n\nThe covertness of OCOs is two-fold, pertaining to both action and actor. First, the OCOs themselves can be kept covert. Unlike kinetic means, some of the technological characteristics of OCOs enable perpetrators to obscure the way in which they were carried out and conceal them from both the defender and the public at large. The second aspect regards the perpetrators, who can conceal their identity and maintain covertness.²\n\nRecent research discussed the importance of deception in the cyber domain and the challenges it creates for states to distinguish between espionage activities in cyberspace and OCOs (Gartzke and Lindsay 2015; Brantly 2016). Furthermore, it suggests that actors can gain unprecedented strategic advantages in conflict short of war by leveraging the scale, speed, and anonymity of cyberspace (Kello 2017; Buchanan 2020; Maschmeyer 2022).\n\nOther scholars offer to characterize OCOs as an intelligence contest, with the aim of gaining an advantage in information acquisition. In this context, successful execution of OCOs necessitates limiting the other side’s access to information. National intelligence services are keenly aware of their own susceptibility to espionage and consequently engage in counterintelligence practices to safeguard their digital information (see Chesney and Smeets 2020; Rovner 2021).\n\nVarious explanations pointed out on the benefits of the use of covert action, ranging from preventing escalation to the ability to signal in secret. These lead to the expectation that countries might prefer to maintain ambiguity or secrecy rather than making a public responses (Lindsay 2015; Carson 2016; Green and Long 2020; Haas and Yarhi-Milo 2021). In addition, secrecy enables leaders to minimize domestic political repercussions, such as facing public backlash for provoking a crisis that may result in an undesirable escalation or for stepping back from a crisis to avoid one (Fearon 1994; Kurizaki 2007).\n\nAn option of partial concealment exists when full concealment is not possible, such as when an OCO has been revealed by the perpetrator or a third party (Romanosky and Boudreaux 2020), or when the damage caused cannot be concealed. In this case, the defender does not want to admit that an attack has taken place but must acknowledge visible damage, and therefore attributes it to a technical malfunction. Examining this option empirically is difficult, since the defender does not reveal that an attack did in fact occur (Baram and Sommer 2019).\n\nThere are also some public options for both the perpetrator and the defender. A standing element of covert action is plausible deniability, which can offer the perpetrator an advantage especially when the covert action is a cyberattack. Deniability allows countries to act in the “gray area” without exacerbating the conflict, although it is often clear to domestic and international audiences that covert action has been taken (Cormac and Aldrich 2018; Aldrich and Moran 2019; Poznansky 2020).\n\nEven when the perpetrator publicly denies involvement, it may or may not have actually carried out the attack attributed to it. Therefore, the key question is if public denial is not perceived as credible, why should states choose this option? This question is further complicated when it comes to OCOs, an arena even more secretive than traditional covert warfare. Therefore, switching to the public option—even if it is a denial and not a public credit claiming—requires an explanation, and literature identifies several (Poznansky 2020). This study identifies the option of public denial as one of the public strategies available to the perpetrator, and examines the possible circumstances in which this strategy might be chosen.\n\nAnother important aspect of OCOs is attribution, recognized as one of the most difficult problems in the cyber world (Gartzke 2013; Kello 2013; Liff 2013; Rid and Buchanan 2015; Eichensehr 2020; Steffens 2020). Attribution is defined as “determining the identity or location of the perpetrator” (Wheeler and Larsen 2003, 1). The\n\n² It is important to distinguish between clandestine and covert operations in this context. A covert operation is one that is conducted without the local population and enemy forces being aware of its existence. Clandestine operations are secret operations that are carried out in a manner that conceals the identity of the operator. In Lindsay’s view (Lindsay 2015), the “perfect” covert action would hide both the harm and the person who committed it.",
    "The Dynamics of Publicity and Secrecy in Offensive Cyber Operations\n\nTable 1. Perpetrator and defender's strategies\n\n|   | Option #1 | Option #2 | Option #3 | Option #4  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  Perpetrator strategy | Full concealment | Public denial | Public credit claiming |   |\n|  Defender strategy | Full concealment | Partial concealment | Publicizing without attribution | Publicizing with public attribution  |\n\nattribution process involves different aspects, including technical, political, legal, strategic and other components (Lin 2016). There are various techniques for carrying out a process of attributing an OCO, and it often requires a considerable investment of different kinds of resources (Broeders, De Busser, and Pawlak 2020).\n\nIn the past few years, it seems that state-sponsored OCOs are being publicly attributed to specific state actors and this trend is being discussed theoretically (Egloff 2020b, 2020a). Although this significant development helps position public attribution as a research issue in itself, most studies in the field do not deal with the dynamics between the perpetrator and defender (for exceptions, see Edwards et al. 2017; Schulzke 2018; Baram 2023). It is important to mention that defenders could decide to reveal the fact that they have suffered a cyberattack or intrusion without attributing it to a specific perpetrator.\n\nRecent discussion regarding voluntary attribution by cyber perpetrators, also described as public credit claiming, maintained that although secrecy is an essential feature of OCOs, some actors choose to publicly claim credit for OCOs they have committed; specifically, this phenomenon is examined among non-state actors (Poznansky and Perkoski 2018).\n\nThe way in which states perceive and understand risk and uncertainty in cyberspace varies significantly, resulting in a less-than-ideal status quo that contributes to heightened levels of risk and uncertainty (Brantly 2021, 2). When either sides need to decide whether to go public or not, there is a degree of uncertainty: the aggressor is not sure how well its operation has gone. The defender is not quite sure (1) if it has encountered a cyberattack or a technical glitch and (2) how far it has been compromised. These are \"hidden\" possibilities, and therefore hard to study but still worth mentioning.\n\nBased on this literature, I categorize the following strategies: the perpetrator can chose from (1) full concealment; (2) public denial; and (3) public credit claiming. The defender can chose from (1) full concealment; (2) partial concealment—disclosing damage but denying that it was caused by a deliberate attack (claiming technical malfunctions, system glitches etc.); (3) publicizing the\n\nOCO without attribution—publicly disclosing that an OCO took place but refraining from publicly identifying the perpetrator; and (4) publicizing the OCO with public attribution—both publicly disclosing that an OCO occurred and publicly attributing it to a specific perpetrator. Table 1 summarizes these strategies. $^3$\n\nAlthough exposing the OCO and attributing it to a perpetrator might damage the defender's image, this also seems to carry certain benefits as well. As the primary objective of this study was to examine the relationship between states' characteristics and their chosen strategies during cyber conflict, several additional variables are required to be taken into account that are associated with the OCOs themselves: the target that was attacked, the method used, whether a third party was involved, and the severity of the damage caused.\n\n## Empirical Analysis\n\nThis section is divided into three parts. First, I discuss the perpetrator and the defender identity and the main countries involved in cyber conflict according to the data. Second, I show variance in the dependent variables, perpetrator strategy and defender strategy, and discuss its meaning and significance. Third, I examine the independent variables—selected factors that might affect perpetrators and defenders' chances for choosing publicity over secrecy.\n\nMultinomial logistic regression analyses were conducted in order to compare all possible strategies of the perpetrator and the defender, on the assumption that decision-makers consider all available options before choosing, at least at the beginning of the process.\n\n3 This variance is wider than only these strategies. Some examples can include sharing information on the attack among elites or with allies, but not with the public; the timing of publicity might change and affect the perpetrator calculations. See Brown and Fazal (2021) on non-denial denials and other kind of \"hidden\" strategies. In addition, it is important to mention the OCOs that would not be detected by the defenders and that the attacker would not report on. As a result, they will not appear in the data.",

The identity of the defenders and the number of OCOs they experienced in 1996–2019.\n\n# Actors Identity\n\nPerpetrators identity—figure 1 shows the main attacking countries and the number of OCOs they carried out in the years 1996–2019. The countries that carried out the most OCOs were China (157), Russia (127), Iran (60), North Korea (34), and the United States (32). Non-democratic countries are at the top of the list, but democratic countries—including the United States, Israel, and South Korea—have also carried out OCOs on a significant scale. All the attackers were states, except for cases where the identity of the attacker was unknown (22 cases—4.7 percent of all attacks).\n\nDefenders identity—figure 2 shows the sixteen most attacked countries and the number of OCOs they experienced in the years 1996–2019. The main defenders were the United States (140), South Korea (26), Ukraine (23), Japan (21), and India (18). Democratic countries seem to be at the top of the list, but non-democratic countries, such as Iran and China, have also experienced many cyberattacks and intrusions as well.⁴\n\n# Perpetrator Strategies\n\nThe perpetrator can choose between three possible strategies: maintaining silence, public denial, or claiming credit. Figure 3 illustrates the variance in strategy chosen by attacking countries. In most cases—374, or 78.6 percent—the perpetrators maintained silence. Public denial was chosen in seventy-one cases (15 percent), and\n\n4 These data show the prominence of the United States in the context of OCOs, as well as the over-reporting of English resources. This is a known issue in the datasets that this paper is based on and they acknowledge this issue (see Online Appendix 1 for the data compilation procedures). In spite of this, this was the best available data at the time of the analysis, and the results should be interpreted accordingly.",
    "The Dynamics of Publicity and Secrecy in Offensive Cyber Operations\n\n![img-2.jpeg](img-2.jpeg)\nFigure 3. Perpetrator strategies.\n\nin thirty-one cases (6.5 percent) the perpetrators claimed full credit for the attack.\n\nWhile maintaining silence is the most prevalent strategy, attacking states chose a public strategy in more than 20 percent of cases. Although trailing far behind the most common choice of silence, at one in five OCOs, the prevalence of public strategies is not negligible.\n\nNow that the variance in perpetrators' strategies has been established, we can turn to test which independent variables affect each kind of strategy. The model described below includes the variables of the regime type, GDP per capita, and the percentage of military force out of the total labor force in the country. The other variables describe the characteristics of the OCO (see Online Appendixes 2 and 3).\n\n# The Perpetrator—Results of the Multinomial Regression\n\nOnce we established the variance in attackers' strategies—which includes a meaningful share of public actions—we now turn to test which independent variables affect each kind of strategy. In each model, a comparison is made between the chances that the perpetrator chooses any of the public strategies versus the chance that it would choose to maintain ambiguity.\n\nThe results in table 2 show that the following variables—regime type, $^{5}$  GDP per capita, method of the attack, and third-party involvement—have an effect on the chances that the perpetrator would choose to claim\n\n5 On the relationship between regime type and initiating cyber conflict, see Hunter et al. (2022).\n\ncredit for an attack or publicly deny it over choosing silence. For robustness, I used several model specifications (see Online Appendix 4).\n\nRegime type—among countries with a democratic regime, the chances of publicly claiming credit for an attack rather than maintaining silence are 11.8 times higher than countries that are nondemocracies.\n\nCountries with anocratic regimes are four times more likely to publicly deny their involvement in the attack than maintain silence compared to countries that are not anocracies.\n\nGDP per capita—perpetrators with a high GDP per capita ( $&gt;$ 8,000) are 2.8 times less likely to choose public denial over silence than countries with a lower GDP ( $p = 0.04$ ), and even less likely to choose public credit claiming, at 3.9 times less than countries with a lower GDP.\n\nThis finding warrants a note, as it is not consistent with the results of the other multinomial regressions that followed that show clearly that high GDP countries are in fact more likely to self-attribute and claim credit. This discrepancy is possibly the result of countries where there is a disparity between regime type and GDP and which manifests differently in each regression. This particular result for the GDP variable is an isolated occurrence that does not affect the overall findings (see Online Appendix 4).\n\nMethod of the attack—in cases where the attack method is considered sophisticated, chances of the perpetrator publicly claiming credit rather than maintaining silence are 7.8 times lower than in cases of less sophisticated attacks. It appears that perpetrators employing sophisticated methods would tend to maintain silence.",

Democracies generally tend to publicly claim credit, while less democratic states tend to choose public denial. When the method of the attack is sophisticated, the chance that the perpetrator exposes the attack and claim credit for it is very low compared to the chance that it maintains silence. When a third party is involved in executing the OCO, the chances of the perpetrator choosing public denial increase greatly (six times more).\n\n## Defender Strategies\n\nAfter detecting an OCO, the defender has four possible strategies: full concealment; partial concealment; revealing the attack without attribution; and revealing the attack with public attribution. As seen in figure 4, there is greater variance here than for the perpetrator. In 222 cases (46.6 percent), the defender chose to maintain silence and made no public reference to the attack. However, in 238 cases (50 percent), defenders chose a public strategy that revealed the attack; among them, 108 cases (22.7 percent) were revealed without attribution and 103 (27.3 percent) with public attribution. Of the three public options, partial concealment was the least chosen strategy, taken in only 16 cases (3.4 percent).",

With exactly one-half of the cases showing that defenders chose one of the public strategies, it seems that at least as often as not, defenders have an interest in going public.\n\n## The Defender—Results of the Multinomial Regression\n\nThe results show in table 3 that the following variables—regime type, GDP per capita, method of the attack, its severity and third-party involvement—impact the chances of the defender choosing a public strategy, whether with or without attribution, rather than choosing silence.\n\nRegime type—countries with a democratic regime were 6.2 times more likely to both publicly reveal the attack and publicly attribute it to a specific perpetrator than nondemocracies.\n\nCountries categorized as anocracies were 4.9 times more likely to choose to publicly reveal both the attack and the perpetrator over maintain silence than countries with a different regime type.\n\nGDP per capita—defenders with a high GDP per capita (&gt;$8,000) were 3.5 times more likely to choose to publicly reveal both the attack and the perpetrator than countries with a lower GDP per capita, and 7 times more likely to reveal the attack without attributing it than countries with lower GDP per capita.\n\nMethod of the attack—countries attacked by more sophisticated methods were 7 times less likely to publicly reveal both the attack and the perpetrator than countries attacked by less sophisticated methods.\n\nSeverity—countries that suffered severe attacks causing a considerable degree of damage had a 3.2 higher chance of choosing to publicly reveal both the attack and the perpetrator over choosing silence compared to",

Chances of them choosing partial concealment were even higher—7.3 times more likely than countries that suffered attacks with lower severity.\n\nThird-party involvement—when a third party was involved in the attack, the chances of the defender choosing to publicly reveal both the attack and the perpetrator over maintaining silence are 3.4 times higher than in cases not involving a third party.\n\n## Discussion and Conclusions\n\nSecrecy is a crucial aspect of OCOs. The use of covert cyber operations allows governments and militaries to achieve their objectives without having to resort to more overt forms of aggression or conflict. However, the secrecy surrounding these operations can also create challenges. For example, it may be difficult for the public to hold government or military actors accountable for their actions in cyberspace if the details of these operations are not transparent.\n\nThis research note points out the variance in state strategies when deciding how to react after an OCO has taken place and also points out some initial explanations. The main innovation of the study is in demonstrating that countries have an interest in choosing public strategies on OCOs, even though these may often be concealed. In certain cases, the defenders have an interest in exposing the OCOs and sometimes even exposing the perpetrator. Perpetrators sometimes refrain from complete silence and make some form of public comment—denial or credit claiming.\n\nThe research offers a systematic analysis of the range of strategies and the chances of choosing each. Using variables to quantify and qualify the characteristics of countries (e.g., regime type, economic and military power) and the OCOs (e.g., method, target, third-party involvement)\n\nhistorically involved in cyber conflict over the past two and a half decades allowed an intersectional analysis of which strategies were chosen by whom, and offered initial insights regarding under what conditions.\n\nThe findings show that the perpetrator's strategy has clear characteristics. While maintaining silence is the preferred strategy, in about one-fifth of the cases the perpetrator prefers to relinquish secrecy by publicly claiming credit or at least publicly denying. The frequency of public strategies is not negligible, and although they do not exceed the frequency of silence, it appears that the perpetrator is often interested in publicly addressing the attacks it has committed.\n\nWhen the perpetrator was a democracy, there was eleven to twelve times higher chance that it will choose to expose the OCO it has committed and claim credit to itself and not maintain silence. When the perpetrator was not a democracy, there was a four times higher chance that it will choose public denial and not maintain silence.\n\nIn the strategies of the defender, there is greater variance: in almost half of the cases (46.6 percent), the defender chose to remain silent and not address the OCO publicly. However, in the second half of the cases, it chose public strategies. Publicity is expressed in two ways: exposing the OCO without attribution to a particular perpetrator and exposing it with public attribution. A partial concealment strategy has only come up in less than 4 percent of cases. From the data, it can be seen that in many cases the defender chose to relinquish secrecy and reveal the fact that it was attacked. When the defender was a democracy, there is a five to six times higher chance that it will choose to expose the OCO and the perpetrator. In addition, when it had a high GDP, it is 3.5–4 times more likely to choose to expose the OCO and the perpetrator.\n\nIn terms of variables related to the OCO itself, it appears that the target type and the involvement of a third party had a significant impact on the likelihood of the",
    "The Dynamics of Publicity and Secrecy in Offensive Cyber Operations\n\nperpetrator and the defender choosing public strategies. When a third party was involved in carrying out the OCO and when the targets were nonmilitary, the chances increased that countries would choose a public strategy.\n\nWhen it comes to public strategies, perpetrators with a low level of democracy had a higher chance of choosing public denial or silence, and those with a higher degree of democracy are more likely to self-attribute, that is, claim credit for the OCO. Defenders with a high level of democracy tend to expose the OCO more than nondemocracies.\n\nWhen it comes to the severity of the OCO, the results were significant for two of the three strategies available to the defender: partial concealment and fully exposing the OCOs with public attribution. Regarding the intermediate strategy of exposing the attack without attribution, the results obtained were not significant. Here, we must bear in mind that extensive damage is often visible and cannot easily be concealed, thereby forcing defenders to take some form of public strategy. But why these specific two of the three options? A possible explanation is that a defender will choose full exposure and public attribution when it can identify the perpetrator with high degree of certainty, and partial concealment, that is, claiming malfunction, when it cannot attribute the attack or does not want to. Therefore, it appears that in cases of obvious damage that cannot be concealed, the intermediate strategy of exposing the attack without exposing the perpetrator carries no significant advantages. Furthermore, when the OCO was carried out by using a more sophisticated method, both perpetrators and defenders had higher chances to remain silent.\n\nThis study provides initial insights regarding the importance of political characteristics of the countries on either side of OCOs, and in identifying previously unexplored patterns of political action. Moving forward, future research should consider several conditioning variables.\n\nFirst, how good are the defender's retaliatory options? If they can retaliate, are defenders more likely to publicize, whereas if they cannot retaliate, are they more likely to remain silent? Relatedly, the decision to publicize is conditioned by whether the public would know that something had happened. For example, the UK government could hardly deny that WannaCry (2017) had happened within the United Kingdom, given that most of the National Health System was affected.6\n\nSecond, is the decision to publicize conditioned by whether the OCO is exploited for kinetic targets or con\n\n6 On the public preferences regarding retaliation in and outside cyberspace, see Shandler, Gross, and Canetti (2021).\n\nfined wholly within cyberspace? Consider Israel's \"Operation Orchard\" (2007), in which Syrian air defenses were reportedly cyberattacked in order to buy time for a kinetic air raid.\n\nThird, when it comes to regime type distinction, future research should consider several issues: Is it that democracies are some of the most advanced cyber powers, such as the United States, Israel, the United Kingdom, that are driving the results? Alternatively, perhaps democracies are particularly assertive overseas, so the results are effectively showing their wider foreign policy.\n\n## Supplementary Information\n\nSupplementary information is available at the Journal of Global Security Studies\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nThe author would like to thank Prof. Isaac Ben Israel, Prof. Udi Sommer and Prof. Yotam Margalit for their insightful comments on an earlier version of this project, and to Eden Poch, Dana Litman, Adi Lotan and Noya Peer for the excellent research assistance.

    "abstract": "Historically, offensive cyber operations (OCOs) have been considered a practice that states could carry out covertly, away from the public eye, with both perpetrators and defenders having incentives to remain silent. Over the past few years, however, perpetrators and defenders have publicly acknowledged their involvement in OCOs. How common is this strategic choice among states? What are its characteristics? In this research note I show that this is not a binary choice, and that there is variance in the strategies available to either side. I then examine what state behavior patterns can be identified by using compiled data of OCOs between 1996 and 2019. I show that this phenomenon of giving up secrecy is occurring and point out on states' characteristics and probabilities of choosing each strategy. Initial findings show significant use of public strategies by perpetrators (20 percent) and more so by defenders (50 percent), and that democracies tend toward public credit claiming and attribution, while less democratic countries tend toward public denial. As governments increasingly engage in OCOs, the implications of this research note are of interest to scholars and practitioners alike.",
