Introduction\nTechnology now controls our daily life to an unprecedented level from water supplies, communication, electricity generation and almost every aspect of our western developed culture \"making it increasingly susceptible to computer network attacks and other cyber operations during armed conflicts\" (Harrison Dinniss 2013). Those computer network attacks have already been launched by patriotic hackers. One of the earliest instances of patriotic hacking can be found in the Kosovo war when pro-Serbian (or anti-Western) hackers, such as the so-called Black Hand, conducted cyber-attacks against NATO, UK and US computers with the goal of disrupting their military operations by deleting all data (Geers 2017). But the Black Hand was not the only hacker group that launched cyber-attacks during the Kosovo conflict. Chinese patriotic hackers also conducted cyber-attacks after a U.S. B-2 stealth bomber dropped five precision-guided munitions on the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade (Wu 2007). Because of the hackers' involvement in the conflict, \"[t]he war in Kosovo has intensified as hackers on either side of the conflict try to take over or block Web servers around the world\" (Messmer 1999). The hackers not only launch cyber-attacks on their own initiative, they were also used as \"proxies to mount cyber-attacks by nation states [such as North Korea or Iran] (...) (Dahan 2013). Tim Maurer also makes clear: \"To project cyber power, (...) states rely on hackers that do not wear uniforms and are not part of the intelligence community – cyber mercenaries or, more badly, cyber proxies\" (Maurer 2018). Yet, the United Nations General Assembly Document A/68/98* of 2013, emphasizes that \"States must not use proxies to commit internationally wrongful acts. States should seek to ensure that their territories are not used by non-State actors for unlawful use of ICTs\" (UN General Assembly 2013). Although 15 nation states, including China, the United States, France and Russia agreed on this, cyber proxies are still used. Nation states support proxies rather than sanctioning them. And even more governments have decided that it is better to work with hackers and cyber proxies although their power inevitably grows. China for instance, inevitably made clear that their cyber proxies and patriotic are \"a powerful threat to the Chinese government because they are a large politically active organization capable of subverting Chinese political stability\" (Hang 2014). This clearly shows that the use of cyber proxies introduces risks such as the principal-agent problem: \"The further detached an agent from a principal's control, the higher the risk that the agent carries out an action that the principal did not intend\" (Maurer 2018). Because of that, several questions arise: (1) Why do states (still) use cyber proxies? (2) Are the states aware of the risks of using cyber proxies? (3) Are states responsible for the actions of their cyber proxies under international law? The aim of this article is to answer these questions in order to shed light on the current role of cyber proxies. But before discussing the questions, the first part will present a definition of cyber proxies and give a brief literature overview. Afterwards, the second part will then elaborate why states use cyber proxies. The third part then describes how the power of cyber proxies rise through their state-relationship before a last part will deal with the question of whether states can be held responsible for the actions of cyber proxies under international law.\nJanine Schmoldt\n## 2. Literature review and definitions\nIt is meanwhile a common belief that hackers constitute a new type of actor in International Relations and International Politics. Particularly in political conflicts, there is often talk about accompanying cyber-attacks conducted by hacker groups where it is unclear how their activities link to the state. Erica Borghard and Shawn Lonergan recently illustrate that states “often form relationships with cyber proxies when they lack an independent ability to conduct cyber operations and/or seek plausibly to deny involvement in a cyber operation” (Borghard, Lonergan 2016). Thereby, states, governments and the hackers themselves “mutually benefit from establishing a relationship, although the specific nature of the goods and services being exchanged varies” (Borghard, Lonergan 2016). Governments could get political and material goods provided by cyber proxies. Through cyber proxies, states can “achieve objectives indirectly, thus shielding governments from political stakeholders who may shy away from direct action” (Borghard, Lonergan 2016). Cyber proxies also offer “political benefits to governments who may want to deny their involvement in a particular operation or even domain” (Borghard, Lonergan 2016). Thus, they provide governments with political goods. In terms of material goods, cyber proxies can offer the technical ability to launch cyber-attacks, “including the manpower” (Borghard, Lonergan 2016). Tim Maurer states that “most states’ proxy relationships fall into one of three main types: delegation, orchestration, and sanctioning” (Maurer 2018). While the delegation concept describes “proxies on a tight leash with the state and under the state’s effective control” (Maurer 2018), orchestration means that proxies receive equipment, funding, or other tools “but no specific instructions” (Maurer 2018). A “shared ideological bond” (Maurer 2018) is crucial for the concept of orchestration. Sanctioning “builds on the counterterrorism literature’s concept of passive support” (Maurer 2018). This topic also found its way into international law debates. Michael Schmitt and Liis Vihul as well as the Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operation for instance dealt with questions of attribution in cyberspace and when cyber activities of hackers and cyber proxies may “be attributed to a state as a matter of international law” (Schmitt, Vihul 2014). Yet, this contribution will also use an international law approach in order to analyse the state responsibility for the actions of their cyber proxies. But before addressing the relationship of states and cyber proxies, it is, however, important to understand what is meant by cyber proxies. By tending towards Erica Borghard’s and Shawn Lonergan’s definition, this contribution regards cyber proxies as non-state hackers who conduct cyber-attacks or cyber operations in order to achieve “a political objective on behalf of a patron state” (Borghard, Lonergan 2016). It is also important to point out that cyber proxies “can be either individuals or loosely organized units comprised of patriotic hackers, hacktivists or cyber terrorists” (Borghard, Lonergan 2016). Yet, this contribution will focus on patriotic hackers as cyber proxies since they have a greater impact than hacktivists or cyber terrorists. In contrast to hacktivists, patriotic hackers not only engage in civil disobedience, they also get active in actual armed conflicts. Driven by patriotism, patriotic hackers hack with the aim to defend their homeland or national pride whereas hacktivists are essentially activists who are driven by the defence of a political or social issue that does not touch upon their home country or residence. Having said this, we can now focus on the state-proxy relationship.\n## 3. The benefits states gain from cyber proxies\nMore and more states use cyber proxies because cyber proxies are incredibly useful – they not only enhance the cyber warfare capabilities of the supporting states, they also provide them with a degree of plausible deniability. Cyber proxies are able to avoid attribution as they can launch cyber operations “with little or no attribution” (Applegate 2011). Scott Applegate illustrates that\n“[t]hese types of attacks can be carried out inexpensively, with little or no political ramifications to the nation-state, and give the attacker a distinct asymmetric advantage. If a nationstate can covertly initiate, fund, or guide such attacks, (...) [relying on cyber proxies] they can potentially achieve their political objectives without the burden of attribution or the need to adhere to the Law of Armed Conflict” (Applegate 2011).\nTherewith, cyber proxies protect governments from the legal consequence of conducting cyber-attacks (Applegate 2011). Similarly, they also shift the problem of attribution. The problem is no longer ‘who carried out the attack’ but rather ‘does the state have/had control and command over the cyber proxies’. The cyber-attacks against Estonia illustrate this. Indeed, Russian patriotic hacker Konstantin Goloskokov has claimed responsibility for the cyber operations. However, the attacks “were in part attributable to the Nashi youth activist group, but it is unclear whether the Russian Federation had a hand in the group’s operations” (Schmitt, Vihul 2014). Related to this, Michael Schmitt and Liis Vihul point out that\nJanine Schmoldt\n\"the relatively high levels of support that are required before a state can be held responsible for the activities of non-state groups or individuals, as distinct from their own responsibility for being involved, creates a normative safe zone for them\" (Schmitt, Vihul 2014).\nAlthough cyber proxies provide plausible deniability, not all states want that as the 2001 cyber-attacks against the U.S. illustrate. In 2001, following the collision of a US EP-3 reconnaissance aircraft and a Chinese F-8 PRC fighter cyber-attack were related to the U.S. (Wu 2007). During this event, the Chinese government was \"not concerned with denying its responsibility for cyber-attacks\" (Hang 2014). On the contrary, \"the Chinese government encouraged computer-savvy citizens to deface American websites to express their displeasure\" (Hang 2014). Similarly, in 1999, when Taiwanese President Li Teng-Hui advocated his two-state-theory China again \"launched the Patriotic Hackers and encouraged other hackers to join during the next crisis with Taiwan\" (Hang 2014). Nevertheless, cyber proxies are used to maintain plausible deniability. Next to that, they also enhance the cyber warfare capabilities of states.\nAnother reason why states work with cyber proxies is to increase their cyber warfare capabilities. This \"can ensure its ascent to a future superpower status\" (Hjortdal 2011). Cyber proxies are especially relevant for states \"when they lack the capability (...) to conduct offensive cyber attacks\" (Borghard, Lonergan 2016). North Korea for instance \"is incentivized to work with cyber proxies because it lacks indigenous capabilities to conduct independent offensive operations\" (Borghard, Lonergan 2016). Furthermore, states use cyber proxies in order \"to respond to an external threat (i.e., a state adversary)\" (Borghard, Lonergan 2016) or to an internal one. In many cases, cyber warfare capabilities constitute an external threat. The United States for instance threatens China through their cyber warfare capabilities and therewith, they constitute an external threat for China. Because of that, China uses cyber proxies in order to \"ensure eventual strategic parity with the United States in technological and military prowess\" (Hjortdal 2011). However, states also use cyber proxies \"to co-opt potential threats to the regime, employing domestic groups that my pose a risk to regime stability to operate against adversaries, thus enabling the government to monitor those groups and keep them occupied\" (Borghard, Lonergan 2016). This directly leads to the next reason why states use cyber proxies.\nThrough the support of cyber proxies states have a certain degree of control through which they can direct cyber proxies away from launching cyber-attacks against the state. Cyber proxies such as patriotic hackers constitute an internal threat especially to China. The cyber-attacks against Indonesia illustrate this. In 1998, many ethnic Chinese living in Indonesia were killed and raped. This constitutes a big dilemma to the Chinese government. One the one hand, the Chinese government could not accept the assaults towards the Chinese ethnicity. But on the other hand, their \"long term foreign policy stance has been not to interfere with other countries internal affairs, and not to be meddled in by foreign powers\" (Wu 2007). Wu highlights: \"If not for the Internet, the Chinese government might have been able to turn a deaf ear toward it and hope it gradually died down\" (Wu 2007). However, Chinese patriotic hackers took \"justice into their own hands\" (Wu 2007) and launched cyber-attacks against Indonesia. Already in 1998 after the Indonesian cyber-attacks, patriotic hackers were able to make Indonesia believe that China declared war. During a press conference on 9 August 1998, the Indonesian government made clear:\n\"We hope Chinese people can keep calm. The past events are our internal affairs. Today, Chinese hackers are coming and we are confused. They are interfering in our problems. Chinese government not only interferes with our internal affairs, but also incites hackers to attack our network. We are very disappointed (...). Certainly, it is hard to believe this thirty-hour long persistent online attack was not an organized operation. If not for the absence of the air defense alarm, I would have believed that China had declared war against us\" (Wu 2007).\nAs opposed to Indonesia assumption, the Chinese government was not involved in the cyber-attacks against Indonesia. On the contrary, Chinese patriotic hackers launched the attacks on their own initiative by forming the Chinese Hacker Emergency Conference Centre in order to \"set a course of action against Indonesia\" (Denning 2011, Henderson 2007, Wu 2007). Twenty years ago, patriotic hackers were able to alter China's politics. They forced the Chinese government to react. Wu emphasizes that patriotic hackers have the potential to even \"transform China's political structure\" (Wu 2007). Cyber proxies are \"now far better situated to influence political outcomes, even within the international area\" (Hang 2014). Therewith, they constitute an internal threat to nation states. Cyber proxies are powerful actors, supporting them means that they are directed \"away from operating against the state\" (Hang 2014). Because of that domestic political control, China for instance, supports patriotic hackers: \"The People's Republic of China supports Patriotic Hacker attacks to control Patriotic\n371\nJanine Schmoldt\nHackers through fostering nationalism among hackers” (Hang 2014). Next to China also other states such as North Korea or Iran work with cyber proxies. And “even more authoritarian governments have decided that it is better to work with rather than against Patriotic Hackers” (Hang 2014). Through this support, cyber proxies will become more powerful (Hang 2014) because they also benefit from the states.\n## 4. The benefits cyber proxies gain from states\nIndeed, cyber proxies also benefit from the support they receive from states. Borghard and Lonergan illustrate that “cyber proxies receive asymmetrically greater benefits from governments than the reverse” (Borghard, Lonergan 2016). Through the support of nation states, cyber proxies are able to finance themselves. Furthermore, they can enhance their technical skills through valuable equipment, including soft- and hardware. The fact, that states work with cyber proxies rather than sanction them shows clearly that states somehow also offer legal protection. In exchange for launching cyber-attacks and/or operations, states can provide money or employment. We must be keenly aware of\n“the magnitude of the financial incentive for cyber proxies, both in terms of direct transfers of money to groups from the state, and the indirect, but more lucrative, benefit to groups of being able to continue to conduct illegal activities in cyber space” (Borghard, Lonergan 2016).\nStates can also provide valuable hard- and software “that may be very expensive or over which they may have a monopoly” (Borghard, Lonergan 2016). With this equipment, cyber proxies can exploit and test their capabilities or even develop other malware and viruses. Except equipment, states “can grant cyber proxies access to the full range of the Internet itself – states can remove restrictions, such as unfettered access and increased bandwidth, enabling the platform to function on an advantageous way for proxies” (Borghard, Lonergan 2016). Furthermore, states can also help to train other cyber proxies, they can “transfer technical knowhow” and even “provide information that can be used to exploit existing vulnerabilities” (Borghard, Lonergan 2016). Therewith, cyber proxies and hackers elevate their political role and they get a voice within the political arena. Operation Allied Force illustrates that cyber proxies can force states to react in the way the proxies want them to. Hackers already have the power to direct states and to influence a political outcome. During Operation Allied Force, the NATO air war against Yugoslavia during the Kosovo War in 1999, the Chinese embassy in Belgrade became accidentally the target of a bombing. As a result, Chinese patriotic hackers conducted cyber-attacks against the U.S. Therewith, “[t]he war in Kosovo has intensified as hackers on either side of the conflict try to take over or block Web servers around the world (...)” (Messmer 1999). This “cyber self-defense war” (Wu 2007) was also a factor why “Washington agreed to pay $28 million for property damage, $4.5 million to the families of the killed and injured, and in April 2000 fired one CIA operations officer involved in the targeting” (Lampton 2002). But the NATO campaign also illustrates another fact: Cyber Proxies or patriotic hackers get active in armed conflicts in order to support their homeland. The Russo-Georgian war of 2008 similarly illustrates that patriotic hackers are involved by conducting cyber-attacks against Georgia in order to defend Russia (Tikk, Kaska, Vihul 2010). In the same year, patriotic hackers were involved in Operation Cast Lead and in Operation Pillar of Cloud during the Gaza War between Palestinians and Israel where they stole lists with contact information of soldiers and reservists and warned them in joining the war (Dahan 2013). The Second Lebanon war, the tensions between Israel and Iran as well as the current conflict in Syria also illustrate that patriotic hackers are involved in armed conflicts. This shows clearly that in theory, international conflicts no longer require a state or state sanction. Cyber proxies from different states fight or hack against each other without governmental direction. The hacker war following the collision of the US EP-3 reconnaissance aircraft and a Chinese F-8 PRC fighter as well the cyber-attacks against Indonesia illustrate this. Cyber proxies can also threaten the internal affairs of a state and therewith the stability of states. All in all, the state’s assistance will enhance the proxies technical and “elevate these hackers into a more prominent political role” (Hang 2014). Rather than sanctioning the illegal activities, states “offer safe haven to cyber proxy groups, both in granting physical security within a state’s sovereign territory, as well as legal protections” (Borghard, Lonergan 2016). Almost all cyber proxies operate outside of the domestic (and international) legal rules and are therefore, susceptible to prosecution and jail. By working with cyber proxies, states are aware of the fact that they refrain from enforcing existing law.\n## 5. States, proxies and international law\nStates are aware of the activities of the proxies and tolerate them “in spite of having the capacity to do otherwise” (Maurer 2018). In these situations, the states are “clearly turning a blind eye to the proxies’ offensive actions” (Maurer 2018). This however, leads to the question of whether states can be held responsible for the\n372\nJanine Schmoldt\nactions of the cyber proxies under international law. The International Law Commission’s Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts make clear:\n“The conduct of a person or group of persons shall be considered an act of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct” (International Law Commission 2001, Article 8).\nThus, the actions of cyber proxies are attributable to the state if the hacker is acting under the instruction or direction or control of a State. The degree of control that must be exercised was a key issue for the International Court of Justice (hereafter ICJ) in a Case Concerning the Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States of America). The question was\n“whether or not the relationship of the contras to the United States Government was so much one of dependence on the one side and control on the other that it would be right to equate the contras, for legal purposes, with an organ of the United States Government, or as acting on behalf of that Government” (International Court of Justice 1986, para.109).\nThe Court applied what has later been called the effective control test. A State can only be held responsible for the acts of non-state actors if the State “directed or enforced” (International Court of Justice 1986, para. 115) the non-state actor. The ICJ thus\n“Decides that the United States of America, by training, arming, equipping, financing and supplying the contra forces or otherwise encouraging, supporting and aiding military and paramilitary activities in and against Nicaragua, has acted, against the Republic of Nicaragua, in breach of its obligation under customary international law not to intervene in the affairs of another State” (International Court of Justice 1986, para.3).\nThe Appeals Chamber of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia has also addressed the degree of control over non-state actors by making clear:\n“One should distinguish the situation of individuals acting on behalf of a State without specific instructions, from that of individuals making up an organised and hierarchically structured group, (...) Consequently, for the attribution to a State of acts of these groups it is sufficient to require that the group as a whole be under the overall control of the State” (International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia 1999, para. 120).\nSpecific instructions are not required for the actions of individuals, as opposed to the effective control test, where specific instructions or directions concerning the performance of an action are required in order to attribute the action to a state. The Chamber thus identified another degree of control, namely the overall control test:\n“In order to attribute the acts of a military or paramilitary group to a State, it must be proved that the State wields overall control over the group, not only by equipping and financing the group, but also by coordinating or helping in the general planning of its military activity. Only then can the State be held internationally accountable for any misconduct of the group” (International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia 1999, para. 131).\nIn the case of cyber proxies, it seems clear, that states have effective and/or overall control over the proxies, especially through the relationship of delegation, orchestration, and sanctioning. States can be held responsible for the actions of a cyber proxies under international law if they have effective and/or overall control or more precisely, if the cyber proxy is acting on the instructions, direction, or control of that state.\n## 6. Conclusion\nMore and more states work with cyber proxies due to three facts. First, cyber proxies avoid attribution and provide plausible deniability. Therewith, they protect states from the legal consequence that (illegal) cyber operations may cause. Second, cyber proxies enhance the cyber warfare capabilities of states when they lack offensive cyber capabilities. Third, cyber proxies co-opt threats as states gain a certain degree of control over the hacker through which they can direct cyber proxies away from launching cyber-attacks against the state. On the other hand, cyber proxies receive greater benefits from states which lead to the fact that their power will inevitably grow. By gaining a state’s support, cyber proxies can finance themselves and enhance their technical skills. Therewith, cyber proxies can not only develop new tools they can also train other hackers. Furthermore,\n373\nJanine Schmoldt\nstates offer legal protection with the result, that hackers will not be prosecuted for illegal cyber operations. However, states who work with cyber proxies are responsible for the actions and operations of the proxies, if the proxies are acting on the instructions, directions, or overall and/or effective control of that state. All in all, cyber proxies get “a seat at the table of political change” (Hang 2014). Cyber proxies can already threaten the internal affairs of a state and therewith the stability of states as past cyberwars have shown.",

Related to this, Michael Schmitt and Liis Vihul point out that Janine Schmoldt\"the relatively high levels of support that are required before a state can be held responsible for the activities of non-state groups or individuals, as distinct from their own responsibility for being involved, creates a normative safe zone for them\"(Schmitt, Vihul 2014).\nAlthough cyber proxies provide plausible deniability, not all states want that as the 2001 cyber-attacks against the U.S. illustrate. In 2001, following the collision of a US EP-3 reconnaissance aircraft and a Chinese F-8 PRC fighter cyber-attack were related to the U.S.. During this event, the Chinese government was\"not concerned with denying its responsibility for cyber-attacks\". On the contrary,\"the Chinese government encouraged computer-savvy citizens to deface American websites to express their displeasure\". Similarly, in 1999, when Taiwanese President Li Teng-Hui advocated his two-state-theory China again\"launched the Patriotic Hackers and encouraged other hackers to join during the next crisis with Taiwan\". Nevertheless, cyber proxies are used to maintain plausible deniability. Next to that, they also enhance the cyber warfare capabilities of states.\nAnother reason why states work with cyber proxies is to increase their cyber warfare capabilities. This\"can ensure its ascent to a future superpower status\". Cyber proxies are especially relevant for states\"when they lack the capability (...) to conduct offensive cyber attacks\"(Borghard, Lonergan 2016). North Korea for instance\"is incentivized to work with cyber proxies because it lacks indigenous capabilities to conduct independent offensive operations\"(Borghard, Lonergan 2016). Furthermore, states use cyber proxies in order\"to respond to an external threat (i.e., a state adversary)\"(Borghard, Lonergan 2016) or to an internal one. In many cases, cyber warfare capabilities constitute an external threat. The United States for instance threatens China through their cyber warfare capabilities and therewith, they constitute an external threat for China. Because of that, China uses cyber proxies in order to\"ensure eventual strategic parity with the United States in technological and military prowess\". However, states also use cyber proxies\"to co-opt potential threats to the regime, employing domestic groups that my pose a risk to regime stability to operate against adversaries, thus enabling the government to monitor those groups and keep them occupied\"(Borghard, Lonergan 2016). This directly leads to the next reason why states use cyber proxies.\nThrough the support of cyber proxies states have a certain degree of control through which they can direct cyber proxies away from launching cyber-attacks against the state. Cyber proxies such as patriotic hackers constitute an internal threat especially to China. The cyber-attacks against Indonesia illustrate this. In 1998, many ethnic Chinese living in Indonesia were killed and raped. This constitutes a big dilemma to the Chinese government. One the one hand, the Chinese government could not accept the assaults towards the Chinese ethnicity. But on the other hand, their\"long term foreign policy stance has been not to interfere with other countries internal affairs, and not to be meddled in by foreign powers\". Wu highlights:\"If not for the Internet, the Chinese government might have been able to turn a deaf ear toward it and hope it gradually died down\". However, Chinese patriotic hackers took\"justice into their own hands\"and launched cyber-attacks against Indonesia. Already in 1998 after the Indonesian cyber-attacks, patriotic hackers were able to make Indonesia believe that China declared war. During a press conference on 9 August 1998, the Indonesian government made clear:\"We hope Chinese people can keep calm. The past events are our internal affairs. Today, Chinese hackers are coming and we are confused. They are interfering in our problems. Chinese government not only interferes with our internal affairs, but also incites hackers to attack our network. We are very disappointed (...). Certainly, it is hard to believe this thirty-hour long persistent online attack was not an organized operation. If not for the absence of the air defense alarm, I would have believed that China had declared war against us\".\nAs opposed to Indonesia assumption, the Chinese government was not involved in the cyber-attacks against Indonesia. On the contrary, Chinese patriotic hackers launched the attacks on their own initiative by forming the Chinese Hacker Emergency Conference Centre in order to\"set a course of action against Indonesia\". Twenty years ago, patriotic hackers were able to alter China's politics. They forced the Chinese government to react. Wu emphasizes that patriotic hackers have the potential to even\"transform China's political structure\". Cyber proxies are\"now far better situated to influence political outcomes, even within the international area\". Therewith, they constitute an internal threat to nation states. Cyber proxies are powerful actors, supporting them means that they are directed\"away from operating against the state\". Because of that domestic political control, China for instance, supports patriotic hackers:\"The People's Republic of China supports Patriotic Hacker attacks to control Patriotic Hackers through fostering nationalism among hackers”. Next to China also other states such as North Korea or Iran work with cyber proxies. And “even more authoritarian governments have decided that it is better to work with rather than against Patriotic Hackers”. Through this support, cyber proxies will become more powerful because they also benefit from the states.\n## 4. The benefits cyber proxies gain from states Indeed, cyber proxies also benefit from the support they receive from states. Borghard and Lonergan illustrate that “cyber proxies receive asymmetrically greater benefits from governments than the reverse” (Borghard, Lonergan 2016). Through the support of nation states, cyber proxies are able to finance themselves. Furthermore, they can enhance their technical skills through valuable equipment, including soft- and hardware. The fact, that states work with cyber proxies rather than sanction them shows clearly that states somehow also offer legal protection. In exchange for launching cyber-attacks and/or operations, states can provide money or employment. We must be keenly aware of “the magnitude of the financial incentive for cyber proxies, both in terms of direct transfers of money to groups from the state, and the indirect, but more lucrative, benefit to groups of being able to continue to conduct illegal activities in cyber space” (Borghard, Lonergan 2016).\nStates can also provide valuable hard- and software “that may be very expensive or over which they may have a monopoly” (Borghard, Lonergan 2016). With this equipment, cyber proxies can exploit and test their capabilities or even develop other malware and viruses. Except equipment, states “can grant cyber proxies access to the full range of the Internet itself – states can remove restrictions, such as unfettered access and increased bandwidth, enabling the platform to function on an advantageous way for proxies” (Borghard, Lonergan 2016). Furthermore, states can also help to train other cyber proxies, they can “transfer technical knowhow” and even “provide information that can be used to exploit existing vulnerabilities” (Borghard, Lonergan 2016). Therewith, cyber proxies and hackers elevate their political role and they get a voice within the political arena. Operation Allied Force illustrates that cyber proxies can force states to react in the way the proxies want them to. Hackers already have the power to direct states and to influence a political outcome. During Operation Allied Force, the NATO air war against Yugoslavia during the Kosovo War in 1999, the Chinese embassy in Belgrade became accidentally the target of a bombing. As a result, Chinese patriotic hackers conducted cyber-attacks against the U.S. Therewith, “[t]he war in Kosovo has intensified as hackers on either side of the conflict try to take over or block Web servers around the world (...)”. This “cyber self-defense war” was also a factor why “Washington agreed to pay $28 million for property damage, $4.5 million to the families of the killed and injured, and in April 2000 fired one CIA operations officer involved in the targeting”. But the NATO campaign also illustrates another fact: Cyber Proxies or patriotic hackers get active in armed conflicts in order to support their homeland. The Russo-Georgian war of 2008 similarly illustrates that patriotic hackers are involved by conducting cyber-attacks against Georgia in order to defend Russia (Tikk, Kaska, Vihul 2010). In the same year, patriotic hackers were involved in Operation Cast Lead and in Operation Pillar of Cloud during the Gaza War between Palestinians and Israel where they stole lists with contact information of soldiers and reservists and warned them in joining the war. The Second Lebanon war, the tensions between Israel and Iran as well as the current conflict in Syria also illustrate that patriotic hackers are involved in armed conflicts. This shows clearly that in theory, international conflicts no longer require a state or state sanction. Cyber proxies from different states fight or hack against each other without governmental direction. The hacker war following the collision of the US EP-3 reconnaissance aircraft and a Chinese F-8 PRC fighter as well the cyber-attacks against Indonesia illustrate this. Cyber proxies can also threaten the internal affairs of a state and therewith the stability of states. All in all, the state’s assistance will enhance the proxies technical and “elevate these hackers into a more prominent political role”. Rather than sanctioning the illegal activities, states “offer safe haven to cyber proxy groups, both in granting physical security within a state’s sovereign territory, as well as legal protections” (Borghard, Lonergan 2016). Almost all cyber proxies operate outside of the domestic (and international) legal rules and are therefore, susceptible to prosecution and jail. By working with cyber proxies, states are aware of the fact that they refrain from enforcing existing law.\n## 5. States, proxies and international law States are aware of the activities of the proxies and tolerate them “in spite of having the capacity to do otherwise”. In these situations, the states are “clearly turning a blind eye to the proxies’ offensive actions”. This however, leads to the question of whether states can be held responsible for the actions of the cyber proxies under international law. The International Law Commission’s Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts make clear: “The conduct of a person or group of persons shall be considered an act of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct” (International Law Commission 2001, Article 8).\nThus, the actions of cyber proxies are attributable to the state if the hacker is acting under the instruction or direction or control of a State. The degree of control that must be exercised was a key issue for the International Court of Justice (hereafter ICJ) in a Case Concerning the Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States of America). The question was “whether or not the relationship of the contras to the United States Government was so much one of dependence on the one side and control on the other that it would be right to equate the contras, for legal purposes, with an organ of the United States Government, or as acting on behalf of that Government” (International Court of Justice 1986, para.109).\nThe Court applied what has later been called the effective control test. A State can only be held responsible for the acts of non-state actors if the State “directed or enforced” (International Court of Justice 1986, para. 115) the non-state actor. The ICJ thus “Decides that the United States of America, by training, arming, equipping, financing and supplying the contra forces or otherwise encouraging, supporting and aiding military and paramilitary activities in and against Nicaragua, has acted, against the Republic of Nicaragua, in breach of its obligation under customary international law not to intervene in the affairs of another State” (International Court of Justice 1986, para.3).\nThe Appeals Chamber of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia has also addressed the degree of control over non-state actors by making clear: “One should distinguish the situation of individuals acting on behalf of a State without specific instructions, from that of individuals making up an organised and hierarchically structured group, (...) Consequently, for the attribution to a State of acts of these groups it is sufficient to require that the group as a whole be under the overall control of the State” (International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia 1999, para. 120).\nSpecific instructions are not required for the actions of individuals, as opposed to the effective control test, where specific instructions or directions concerning the performance of an action are required in order to attribute the action to a state. The Chamber thus identified another degree of control, namely the overall control test: “In order to attribute the acts of a military or paramilitary group to a State, it must be proved that the State wields overall control over the group, not only by equipping and financing the group, but also by coordinating or helping in the general planning of its military activity. Only then can the State be held internationally accountable for any misconduct of the group” (International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia 1999, para. 131).\nIn the case of cyber proxies, it seems clear, that states have effective and/or overall control over the proxies, especially through the relationship of delegation, orchestration, and sanctioning. States can be held responsible for the actions of a cyber proxies under international law if they have effective and/or overall control or more precisely, if the cyber proxy is acting on the instructions, direction, or control of that state.\n## 6. Conclusion More and more states work with cyber proxies due to three facts. First, cyber proxies avoid attribution and provide plausible deniability. Therewith, they protect states from the legal consequence that (illegal) cyber operations may cause. Second, cyber proxies enhance the cyber warfare capabilities of states when they lack offensive cyber capabilities. Third, cyber proxies co-opt threats as states gain a certain degree of control over the hacker through which they can direct cyber proxies away from launching cyber-attacks against the state. On the other hand, cyber proxies receive greater benefits from states which lead to the fact that their power will inevitably grow. By gaining a state’s support, cyber proxies can finance themselves and enhance their technical skills. Therewith, cyber proxies can not only develop new tools they can also train other hackers. Furthermore, states offer legal protection with the result, that hackers will not be prosecuted for illegal cyber operations. However, states who work with cyber proxies are responsible for the actions and operations of the proxies, if the proxies are acting on the instructions, directions, or overall and/or effective control of that state. All in all, cyber proxies get “a seat at the table of political change”. Cyber proxies can already threaten the internal affairs of a state and therewith the stability of states as past cyberwars have shown.",

The benefits states gain from cyber proxies More and more states use cyber proxies because cyber proxies are incredibly useful – they not only enhance the cyber warfare capabilities of the supporting states, they also provide them with a degree of plausible deniability. Cyber proxies are able to avoid attribution as they can launch cyber operations “with little or no attribution”. Scott Applegate illustrates that “[t]hese types of attacks can be carried out inexpensively, with little or no political ramifications to the nation-state, and give the attacker a distinct asymmetric advantage.

Introduction Technology now controls our daily life to an unprecedented level from water supplies, communication, electricity generation and almost every aspect of our western developed culture\"making it increasingly susceptible to computer network attacks and other cyber operations during armed conflicts\"(Harrison Dinniss 2013). Those computer network attacks have already been launched by patriotic hackers. One of the earliest instances of patriotic hacking can be found in the Kosovo war when pro-Serbian (or anti-Western) hackers, such as the so-called Black Hand, conducted cyber-attacks against NATO, UK and US computers with the goal of disrupting their military operations by deleting all data. But the Black Hand was not the only hacker group that launched cyber-attacks during the Kosovo conflict. Chinese patriotic hackers also conducted cyber-attacks after a U.S. B-2 stealth bomber dropped five precision-guided munitions on the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade. Because of the hackers' involvement in the conflict,\"[t]he war in Kosovo has intensified as hackers on either side of the conflict try to take over or block Web servers around the world\". The hackers not only launch cyber-attacks on their own initiative, they were also used as\"proxies to mount cyber-attacks by nation states [such as North Korea or Iran] (...). Tim Maurer also makes clear:\"To project cyber power, (...) states rely on hackers that do not wear uniforms and are not part of the intelligence community – cyber mercenaries or, more badly, cyber proxies\". Yet, the United Nations General Assembly Document A/68/98* of 2013, emphasizes that\"States must not use proxies to commit internationally wrongful acts. States should seek to ensure that their territories are not used by non-State actors for unlawful use of ICTs\"(UN General Assembly 2013). Although 15 nation states, including China, the United States, France and Russia agreed on this, cyber proxies are still used. Nation states support proxies rather than sanctioning them. And even more governments have decided that it is better to work with hackers and cyber proxies although their power inevitably grows. China for instance, inevitably made clear that their cyber proxies and patriotic are\"a powerful threat to the Chinese government because they are a large politically active organization capable of subverting Chinese political stability\". This clearly shows that the use of cyber proxies introduces risks such as the principal-agent problem:\"The further detached an agent from a principal's control, the higher the risk that the agent carries out an action that the principal did not intend\". Because of that, several questions arise: (1) Why do states (still) use cyber proxies? (2) Are the states aware of the risks of using cyber proxies? (3) Are states responsible for the actions of their cyber proxies under international law? The aim of this article is to answer these questions in order to shed light on the current role of cyber proxies. But before discussing the questions, the first part will present a definition of cyber proxies and give a brief literature overview. Afterwards, the second part will then elaborate why states use cyber proxies. The third part then describes how the power of cyber proxies rise through their state-relationship before a last part will deal with the question of whether states can be held responsible for the actions of cyber proxies under international law.\nJanine Schmoldt ## 2. Literature review and definitions It is meanwhile a common belief that hackers constitute a new type of actor in International Relations and International Politics. Particularly in political conflicts, there is often talk about accompanying cyber-attacks conducted by hacker groups where it is unclear how their activities link to the state. Erica Borghard and Shawn Lonergan recently illustrate that states “often form relationships with cyber proxies when they lack an independent ability to conduct cyber operations and/or seek plausibly to deny involvement in a cyber operation” (Borghard, Lonergan 2016). Thereby, states, governments and the hackers themselves “mutually benefit from establishing a relationship, although the specific nature of the goods and services being exchanged varies” (Borghard, Lonergan 2016). Governments could get political and material goods provided by cyber proxies. Through cyber proxies, states can “achieve objectives indirectly, thus shielding governments from political stakeholders who may shy away from direct action” (Borghard, Lonergan 2016). Cyber proxies also offer “political benefits to governments who may want to deny their involvement in a particular operation or even domain” (Borghard, Lonergan 2016). Thus, they provide governments with political goods. In terms of material goods, cyber proxies can offer the technical ability to launch cyber-attacks, “including the manpower” (Borghard, Lonergan 2016). Tim Maurer states that “most states’ proxy relationships fall into one of three main types: delegation, orchestration, and sanctioning”. While the delegation concept describes “proxies on a tight leash with the state and under the state’s effective control”, orchestration means that proxies receive equipment, funding, or other tools “but no specific instructions”. A “shared ideological bond” is crucial for the concept of orchestration. Sanctioning “builds on the counterterrorism literature’s concept of passive support”. This topic also found its way into international law debates. Michael Schmitt and Liis Vihul as well as the Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operation for instance dealt with questions of attribution in cyberspace and when cyber activities of hackers and cyber proxies may “be attributed to a state as a matter of international law” (Schmitt, Vihul 2014). Yet, this contribution will also use an international law approach in order to analyse the state responsibility for the actions of their cyber proxies. But before addressing the relationship of states and cyber proxies, it is, however, important to understand what is meant by cyber proxies. By tending towards Erica Borghard’s and Shawn Lonergan’s definition, this contribution regards cyber proxies as non-state hackers who conduct cyber-attacks or cyber operations in order to achieve “a political objective on behalf of a patron state” (Borghard, Lonergan 2016). It is also important to point out that cyber proxies “can be either individuals or loosely organized units comprised of patriotic hackers, hacktivists or cyber terrorists” (Borghard, Lonergan 2016). Yet, this contribution will focus on patriotic hackers as cyber proxies since they have a greater impact than hacktivists or cyber terrorists. In contrast to hacktivists, patriotic hackers not only engage in civil disobedience, they also get active in actual armed conflicts. Driven by patriotism, patriotic hackers hack with the aim to defend their homeland or national pride whereas hacktivists are essentially activists who are driven by the defence of a political or social issue that does not touch upon their home country or residence. Having said this, we can now focus on the state-proxy relationship.\n## 3. The benefits states gain from cyber proxies More and more states use cyber proxies because cyber proxies are incredibly useful – they not only enhance the cyber warfare capabilities of the supporting states, they also provide them with a degree of plausible deniability. Cyber proxies are able to avoid attribution as they can launch cyber operations “with little or no attribution”. Scott Applegate illustrates that “[t]hese types of attacks can be carried out inexpensively, with little or no political ramifications to the nation-state, and give the attacker a distinct asymmetric advantage. If a nationstate can covertly initiate, fund, or guide such attacks, (...) [relying on cyber proxies] they can potentially achieve their political objectives without the burden of attribution or the need to adhere to the Law of Armed Conflict”.\nTherewith, cyber proxies protect governments from the legal consequence of conducting cyber-attacks. Similarly, they also shift the problem of attribution. The problem is no longer ‘who carried out the attack’ but rather ‘does the state have/had control and command over the cyber proxies’. The cyber-attacks against Estonia illustrate this. Indeed, Russian patriotic hacker Konstantin Goloskokov has claimed responsibility for the cyber operations. However, the attacks “were in part attributable to the Nashi youth activist group, but it is unclear whether the Russian Federation had a hand in the group’s operations” (Schmitt, Vihul 2014). Related to this, Michael Schmitt and Liis Vihul point out that Janine Schmoldt\"the relatively high levels of support that are required before a state can be held responsible for the activities of non-state groups or individuals, as distinct from their own responsibility for being involved, creates a normative safe zone for them\"(Schmitt, Vihul 2014).\nAlthough cyber proxies provide plausible deniability, not all states want that as the 2001 cyber-attacks against the U.S. illustrate. In 2001, following the collision of a US EP-3 reconnaissance aircraft and a Chinese F-8 PRC fighter cyber-attack were related to the U.S.. During this event, the Chinese government was\"not concerned with denying its responsibility for cyber-attacks\". On the contrary,\"the Chinese government encouraged computer-savvy citizens to deface American websites to express their displeasure\". Similarly, in 1999, when Taiwanese President Li Teng-Hui advocated his two-state-theory China again\"launched the Patriotic Hackers and encouraged other hackers to join during the next crisis with Taiwan\". Nevertheless, cyber proxies are used to maintain plausible deniability. Next to that, they also enhance the cyber warfare capabilities of states.\nAnother reason why states work with cyber proxies is to increase their cyber warfare capabilities. This\"can ensure its ascent to a future superpower status\". Cyber proxies are especially relevant for states\"when they lack the capability (...) to conduct offensive cyber attacks\"(Borghard, Lonergan 2016). North Korea for instance\"is incentivized to work with cyber proxies because it lacks indigenous capabilities to conduct independent offensive operations\"(Borghard, Lonergan 2016). Furthermore, states use cyber proxies in order\"to respond to an external threat (i.e., a state adversary)\"(Borghard, Lonergan 2016) or to an internal one. In many cases, cyber warfare capabilities constitute an external threat. The United States for instance threatens China through their cyber warfare capabilities and therewith, they constitute an external threat for China. Because of that, China uses cyber proxies in order to\"ensure eventual strategic parity with the United States in technological and military prowess\". However, states also use cyber proxies\"to co-opt potential threats to the regime, employing domestic groups that my pose a risk to regime stability to operate against adversaries, thus enabling the government to monitor those groups and keep them occupied\"(Borghard, Lonergan 2016). This directly leads to the next reason why states use cyber proxies.\nThrough the support of cyber proxies states have a certain degree of control through which they can direct cyber proxies away from launching cyber-attacks against the state. Cyber proxies such as patriotic hackers constitute an internal threat especially to China. The cyber-attacks against Indonesia illustrate this. In 1998, many ethnic Chinese living in Indonesia were killed and raped. This constitutes a big dilemma to the Chinese government. One the one hand, the Chinese government could not accept the assaults towards the Chinese ethnicity. But on the other hand, their\"long term foreign policy stance has been not to interfere with other countries internal affairs, and not to be meddled in by foreign powers\". Wu highlights:\"If not for the Internet, the Chinese government might have been able to turn a deaf ear toward it and hope it gradually died down\". However, Chinese patriotic hackers took\"justice into their own hands\"and launched cyber-attacks against Indonesia. Already in 1998 after the Indonesian cyber-attacks, patriotic hackers were able to make Indonesia believe that China declared war. During a press conference on 9 August 1998, the Indonesian government made clear:\"We hope Chinese people can keep calm. The past events are our internal affairs. Today, Chinese hackers are coming and we are confused. They are interfering in our problems. Chinese government not only interferes with our internal affairs, but also incites hackers to attack our network. We are very disappointed (...). Certainly, it is hard to believe this thirty-hour long persistent online attack was not an organized operation. If not for the absence of the air defense alarm, I would have believed that China had declared war against us\".\nAs opposed to Indonesia assumption, the Chinese government was not involved in the cyber-attacks against Indonesia. On the contrary, Chinese patriotic hackers launched the attacks on their own initiative by forming the Chinese Hacker Emergency Conference Centre in order to\"set a course of action against Indonesia\". Twenty years ago, patriotic hackers were able to alter China's politics. They forced the Chinese government to react. Wu emphasizes that patriotic hackers have the potential to even\"transform China's political structure\". Cyber proxies are\"now far better situated to influence political outcomes, even within the international area\". Therewith, they constitute an internal threat to nation states. Cyber proxies are powerful actors, supporting them means that they are directed\"away from operating against the state\". Because of that domestic political control, China for instance, supports patriotic hackers:\"The People's Republic of China supports Patriotic Hacker attacks to control Patriotic Hackers through fostering nationalism among hackers”. Next to China also other states such as North Korea or Iran work with cyber proxies. And “even more authoritarian governments have decided that it is better to work with rather than against Patriotic Hackers”. Through this support, cyber proxies will become more powerful because they also benefit from the states.\n## 4. The benefits cyber proxies gain from states Indeed, cyber proxies also benefit from the support they receive from states. Borghard and Lonergan illustrate that “cyber proxies receive asymmetrically greater benefits from governments than the reverse” (Borghard, Lonergan 2016). Through the support of nation states, cyber proxies are able to finance themselves. Furthermore, they can enhance their technical skills through valuable equipment, including soft- and hardware. The fact, that states work with cyber proxies rather than sanction them shows clearly that states somehow also offer legal protection. In exchange for launching cyber-attacks and/or operations, states can provide money or employment. We must be keenly aware of “the magnitude of the financial incentive for cyber proxies, both in terms of direct transfers of money to groups from the state, and the indirect, but more lucrative, benefit to groups of being able to continue to conduct illegal activities in cyber space” (Borghard, Lonergan 2016).\nStates can also provide valuable hard- and software “that may be very expensive or over which they may have a monopoly” (Borghard, Lonergan 2016). With this equipment, cyber proxies can exploit and test their capabilities or even develop other malware and viruses. Except equipment, states “can grant cyber proxies access to the full range of the Internet itself – states can remove restrictions, such as unfettered access and increased bandwidth, enabling the platform to function on an advantageous way for proxies” (Borghard, Lonergan 2016). Furthermore, states can also help to train other cyber proxies, they can “transfer technical knowhow” and even “provide information that can be used to exploit existing vulnerabilities” (Borghard, Lonergan 2016). Therewith, cyber proxies and hackers elevate their political role and they get a voice within the political arena. Operation Allied Force illustrates that cyber proxies can force states to react in the way the proxies want them to. Hackers already have the power to direct states and to influence a political outcome. During Operation Allied Force, the NATO air war against Yugoslavia during the Kosovo War in 1999, the Chinese embassy in Belgrade became accidentally the target of a bombing. As a result, Chinese patriotic hackers conducted cyber-attacks against the U.S. Therewith, “[t]he war in Kosovo has intensified as hackers on either side of the conflict try to take over or block Web servers around the world (...)”. This “cyber self-defense war” was also a factor why “Washington agreed to pay $28 million for property damage, $4.5 million to the families of the killed and injured, and in April 2000 fired one CIA operations officer involved in the targeting”. But the NATO campaign also illustrates another fact: Cyber Proxies or patriotic hackers get active in armed conflicts in order to support their homeland. The Russo-Georgian war of 2008 similarly illustrates that patriotic hackers are involved by conducting cyber-attacks against Georgia in order to defend Russia (Tikk, Kaska, Vihul 2010). In the same year, patriotic hackers were involved in Operation Cast Lead and in Operation Pillar of Cloud during the Gaza War between Palestinians and Israel where they stole lists with contact information of soldiers and reservists and warned them in joining the war. The Second Lebanon war, the tensions between Israel and Iran as well as the current conflict in Syria also illustrate that patriotic hackers are involved in armed conflicts. This shows clearly that in theory, international conflicts no longer require a state or state sanction. Cyber proxies from different states fight or hack against each other without governmental direction. The hacker war following the collision of the US EP-3 reconnaissance aircraft and a Chinese F-8 PRC fighter as well the cyber-attacks against Indonesia illustrate this. Cyber proxies can also threaten the internal affairs of a state and therewith the stability of states. All in all, the state’s assistance will enhance the proxies technical and “elevate these hackers into a more prominent political role”. Rather than sanctioning the illegal activities, states “offer safe haven to cyber proxy groups, both in granting physical security within a state’s sovereign territory, as well as legal protections” (Borghard, Lonergan 2016). Almost all cyber proxies operate outside of the domestic (and international) legal rules and are therefore, susceptible to prosecution and jail. By working with cyber proxies, states are aware of the fact that they refrain from enforcing existing law.\n## 5. States, proxies and international law States are aware of the activities of the proxies and tolerate them “in spite of having the capacity to do otherwise”. In these situations, the states are “clearly turning a blind eye to the proxies’ offensive actions”. This however, leads to the question of whether states can be held responsible for the actions of the cyber proxies under international law. The International Law Commission’s Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts make clear: “The conduct of a person or group of persons shall be considered an act of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct” (International Law Commission 2001, Article 8).\nThus, the actions of cyber proxies are attributable to the state if the hacker is acting under the instruction or direction or control of a State. The degree of control that must be exercised was a key issue for the International Court of Justice (hereafter ICJ) in a Case Concerning the Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States of America). The question was “whether or not the relationship of the contras to the United States Government was so much one of dependence on the one side and control on the other that it would be right to equate the contras, for legal purposes, with an organ of the United States Government, or as acting on behalf of that Government” (International Court of Justice 1986, para.109).\nThe Court applied what has later been called the effective control test. A State can only be held responsible for the acts of non-state actors if the State “directed or enforced” (International Court of Justice 1986, para. 115) the non-state actor. The ICJ thus “Decides that the United States of America, by training, arming, equipping, financing and supplying the contra forces or otherwise encouraging, supporting and aiding military and paramilitary activities in and against Nicaragua, has acted, against the Republic of Nicaragua, in breach of its obligation under customary international law not to intervene in the affairs of another State” (International Court of Justice 1986, para.3).\nThe Appeals Chamber of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia has also addressed the degree of control over non-state actors by making clear: “One should distinguish the situation of individuals acting on behalf of a State without specific instructions, from that of individuals making up an organised and hierarchically structured group, (...) Consequently, for the attribution to a State of acts of these groups it is sufficient to require that the group as a whole be under the overall control of the State” (International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia 1999, para. 120).\nSpecific instructions are not required for the actions of individuals, as opposed to the effective control test, where specific instructions or directions concerning the performance of an action are required in order to attribute the action to a state. The Chamber thus identified another degree of control, namely the overall control test: “In order to attribute the acts of a military or paramilitary group to a State, it must be proved that the State wields overall control over the group, not only by equipping and financing the group, but also by coordinating or helping in the general planning of its military activity. Only then can the State be held internationally accountable for any misconduct of the group” (International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia 1999, para. 131).\nIn the case of cyber proxies, it seems clear, that states have effective and/or overall control over the proxies, especially through the relationship of delegation, orchestration, and sanctioning. States can be held responsible for the actions of a cyber proxies under international law if they have effective and/or overall control or more precisely, if the cyber proxy is acting on the instructions, direction, or control of that state.\n## 6. Conclusion More and more states work with cyber proxies due to three facts. First, cyber proxies avoid attribution and provide plausible deniability. Therewith, they protect states from the legal consequence that (illegal) cyber operations may cause. Second, cyber proxies enhance the cyber warfare capabilities of states when they lack offensive cyber capabilities. Third, cyber proxies co-opt threats as states gain a certain degree of control over the hacker through which they can direct cyber proxies away from launching cyber-attacks against the state. On the other hand, cyber proxies receive greater benefits from states which lead to the fact that their power will inevitably grow. By gaining a state’s support, cyber proxies can finance themselves and enhance their technical skills. Therewith, cyber proxies can not only develop new tools they can also train other hackers. Furthermore, states offer legal protection with the result, that hackers will not be prosecuted for illegal cyber operations. However, states who work with cyber proxies are responsible for the actions and operations of the proxies, if the proxies are acting on the instructions, directions, or overall and/or effective control of that state. All in all, cyber proxies get “a seat at the table of political change”. Cyber proxies can already threaten the internal affairs of a state and therewith the stability of states as past cyberwars have shown.",

Thus, even more governments have decided that it is better to work with rather than against cyber proxies. But this also leads to the question of whether states can be held responsible under international law for the actions of the cyber proxies and hackers.\nKeywords: cyber proxies, cyberwarfare, patriotic hackers, international law\n# 1. Introduction\nTechnology now controls our daily life to an unprecedented level from water supplies, communication, electricity generation and almost every aspect of our western developed culture \"making it increasingly susceptible to computer network attacks and other cyber operations during armed conflicts\" (Harrison Dinniss 2013). Those computer network attacks have already been launched by patriotic hackers. One of the earliest instances of patriotic hacking can be found in the Kosovo war when pro-Serbian (or anti-Western) hackers, such as the so-called Black Hand, conducted cyber-attacks against NATO, UK and US computers with the goal of disrupting their military operations by deleting all data (Geers 2017). But the Black Hand was not the only hacker group that launched cyber-attacks during the Kosovo conflict. Chinese patriotic hackers also conducted cyber-attacks after a U.S. B-2 stealth bomber dropped five precision-guided munitions on the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade (Wu 2007). Because of the hackers' involvement in the conflict, \"[t]he war in Kosovo has intensified as hackers on either side of the conflict try to take over or block Web servers around the world\" (Messmer 1999). The hackers not only launch cyber-attacks on their own initiative, they were also used as \"proxies to mount cyber-attacks by nation states [such as North Korea or Iran] (...) (Dahan 2013). Tim Maurer also makes clear: \"To project cyber power, (...) states rely on hackers that do not wear uniforms and are not part of the intelligence community – cyber mercenaries or, more badly, cyber proxies\" (Maurer 2018). Yet, the United Nations General Assembly Document A/68/98* of 2013, emphasizes that \"States must not use proxies to commit internationally wrongful acts. States should seek to ensure that their territories are not used by non-State actors for unlawful use of ICTs\" (UN General Assembly 2013). Although 15 nation states, including China, the United States, France and Russia agreed on this, cyber proxies are still used. Nation states support proxies rather than sanctioning them. And even more governments have decided that it is better to work with hackers and cyber proxies although their power inevitably grows. China for instance, inevitably made clear that their cyber proxies and patriotic are \"a powerful threat to the Chinese government because they are a large politically active organization capable of subverting Chinese political stability\" (Hang 2014). This clearly shows that the use of cyber proxies introduces risks such as the principal-agent problem: \"The further detached an agent from a principal's control, the higher the risk that the agent carries out an action that the principal did not intend\" (Maurer 2018). Because of that, several questions arise: (1) Why do states (still) use cyber proxies? (2) Are the states aware of the risks of using cyber proxies? (3) Are states responsible for the actions of their cyber proxies under international law? The aim of this article is to answer these questions in order to shed light on the current role of cyber proxies. But before discussing the questions, the first part will present a definition of cyber proxies and give a brief literature overview. Afterwards, the second part will then elaborate why states use cyber proxies. The third part then describes how the power of cyber proxies rise through their state-relationship before a last part will deal with the question of whether states can be held responsible for the actions of cyber proxies under international law.\nJanine Schmoldt\n## 2. Literature review and definitions\nIt is meanwhile a common belief that hackers constitute a new type of actor in International Relations and International Politics. Particularly in political conflicts, there is often talk about accompanying cyber-attacks conducted by hacker groups where it is unclear how their activities link to the state. Erica Borghard and Shawn Lonergan recently illustrate that states “often form relationships with cyber proxies when they lack an independent ability to conduct cyber operations and/or seek plausibly to deny involvement in a cyber operation” (Borghard, Lonergan 2016). Thereby, states, governments and the hackers themselves “mutually benefit from establishing a relationship, although the specific nature of the goods and services being exchanged varies” (Borghard, Lonergan 2016). Governments could get political and material goods provided by cyber proxies. Through cyber proxies, states can “achieve objectives indirectly, thus shielding governments from political stakeholders who may shy away from direct action” (Borghard, Lonergan 2016). Cyber proxies also offer “political benefits to governments who may want to deny their involvement in a particular operation or even domain” (Borghard, Lonergan 2016). Thus, they provide governments with political goods. In terms of material goods, cyber proxies can offer the technical ability to launch cyber-attacks, “including the manpower” (Borghard, Lonergan 2016). Tim Maurer states that “most states’ proxy relationships fall into one of three main types: delegation, orchestration, and sanctioning” (Maurer 2018). While the delegation concept describes “proxies on a tight leash with the state and under the state’s effective control” (Maurer 2018), orchestration means that proxies receive equipment, funding, or other tools “but no specific instructions” (Maurer 2018). A “shared ideological bond” (Maurer 2018) is crucial for the concept of orchestration. Sanctioning “builds on the counterterrorism literature’s concept of passive support” (Maurer 2018). This topic also found its way into international law debates. Michael Schmitt and Liis Vihul as well as the Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operation for instance dealt with questions of attribution in cyberspace and when cyber activities of hackers and cyber proxies may “be attributed to a state as a matter of international law” (Schmitt, Vihul 2014). Yet, this contribution will also use an international law approach in order to analyse the state responsibility for the actions of their cyber proxies. But before addressing the relationship of states and cyber proxies, it is, however, important to understand what is meant by cyber proxies. By tending towards Erica Borghard’s and Shawn Lonergan’s definition, this contribution regards cyber proxies as non-state hackers who conduct cyber-attacks or cyber operations in order to achieve “a political objective on behalf of a patron state” (Borghard, Lonergan 2016). It is also important to point out that cyber proxies “can be either individuals or loosely organized units comprised of patriotic hackers, hacktivists or cyber terrorists” (Borghard, Lonergan 2016). Yet, this contribution will focus on patriotic hackers as cyber proxies since they have a greater impact than hacktivists or cyber terrorists. In contrast to hacktivists, patriotic hackers not only engage in civil disobedience, they also get active in actual armed conflicts. Driven by patriotism, patriotic hackers hack with the aim to defend their homeland or national pride whereas hacktivists are essentially activists who are driven by the defence of a political or social issue that does not touch upon their home country or residence. Having said this, we can now focus on the state-proxy relationship.\n## 3. The benefits states gain from cyber proxies\nMore and more states use cyber proxies because cyber proxies are incredibly useful – they not only enhance the cyber warfare capabilities of the supporting states, they also provide them with a degree of plausible deniability. Cyber proxies are able to avoid attribution as they can launch cyber operations “with little or no attribution” (Applegate 2011). Scott Applegate illustrates that\n“[t]hese types of attacks can be carried out inexpensively, with little or no political ramifications to the nation-state, and give the attacker a distinct asymmetric advantage. If a nationstate can covertly initiate, fund, or guide such attacks, (...) [relying on cyber proxies] they can potentially achieve their political objectives without the burden of attribution or the need to adhere to the Law of Armed Conflict” (Applegate 2011).\nTherewith, cyber proxies protect governments from the legal consequence of conducting cyber-attacks (Applegate 2011). Similarly, they also shift the problem of attribution. The problem is no longer ‘who carried out the attack’ but rather ‘does the state have/had control and command over the cyber proxies’. The cyber-attacks against Estonia illustrate this. Indeed, Russian patriotic hacker Konstantin Goloskokov has claimed responsibility for the cyber operations. However, the attacks “were in part attributable to the Nashi youth activist group, but it is unclear whether the Russian Federation had a hand in the group’s operations” (Schmitt, Vihul 2014). Related to this, Michael Schmitt and Liis Vihul point out that\nJanine Schmoldt\n\"the relatively high levels of support that are required before a state can be held responsible for the activities of non-state groups or individuals, as distinct from their own responsibility for being involved, creates a normative safe zone for them\" (Schmitt, Vihul 2014).\nAlthough cyber proxies provide plausible deniability, not all states want that as the 2001 cyber-attacks against the U.S. illustrate. In 2001, following the collision of a US EP-3 reconnaissance aircraft and a Chinese F-8 PRC fighter cyber-attack were related to the U.S. (Wu 2007). During this event, the Chinese government was \"not concerned with denying its responsibility for cyber-attacks\" (Hang 2014). On the contrary, \"the Chinese government encouraged computer-savvy citizens to deface American websites to express their displeasure\" (Hang 2014). Similarly, in 1999, when Taiwanese President Li Teng-Hui advocated his two-state-theory China again \"launched the Patriotic Hackers and encouraged other hackers to join during the next crisis with Taiwan\" (Hang 2014). Nevertheless, cyber proxies are used to maintain plausible deniability. Next to that, they also enhance the cyber warfare capabilities of states.\nAnother reason why states work with cyber proxies is to increase their cyber warfare capabilities. This \"can ensure its ascent to a future superpower status\" (Hjortdal 2011). Cyber proxies are especially relevant for states \"when they lack the capability (...) to conduct offensive cyber attacks\" (Borghard, Lonergan 2016). North Korea for instance \"is incentivized to work with cyber proxies because it lacks indigenous capabilities to conduct independent offensive operations\" (Borghard, Lonergan 2016). Furthermore, states use cyber proxies in order \"to respond to an external threat (i.e., a state adversary)\" (Borghard, Lonergan 2016) or to an internal one. In many cases, cyber warfare capabilities constitute an external threat. The United States for instance threatens China through their cyber warfare capabilities and therewith, they constitute an external threat for China. Because of that, China uses cyber proxies in order to \"ensure eventual strategic parity with the United States in technological and military prowess\" (Hjortdal 2011). However, states also use cyber proxies \"to co-opt potential threats to the regime, employing domestic groups that my pose a risk to regime stability to operate against adversaries, thus enabling the government to monitor those groups and keep them occupied\" (Borghard, Lonergan 2016). This directly leads to the next reason why states use cyber proxies.\nThrough the support of cyber proxies states have a certain degree of control through which they can direct cyber proxies away from launching cyber-attacks against the state. Cyber proxies such as patriotic hackers constitute an internal threat especially to China. The cyber-attacks against Indonesia illustrate this. In 1998, many ethnic Chinese living in Indonesia were killed and raped. This constitutes a big dilemma to the Chinese government. One the one hand, the Chinese government could not accept the assaults towards the Chinese ethnicity. But on the other hand, their \"long term foreign policy stance has been not to interfere with other countries internal affairs, and not to be meddled in by foreign powers\" (Wu 2007). Wu highlights: \"If not for the Internet, the Chinese government might have been able to turn a deaf ear toward it and hope it gradually died down\" (Wu 2007). However, Chinese patriotic hackers took \"justice into their own hands\" (Wu 2007) and launched cyber-attacks against Indonesia. Already in 1998 after the Indonesian cyber-attacks, patriotic hackers were able to make Indonesia believe that China declared war. During a press conference on 9 August 1998, the Indonesian government made clear:\n\"We hope Chinese people can keep calm. The past events are our internal affairs. Today, Chinese hackers are coming and we are confused. They are interfering in our problems. Chinese government not only interferes with our internal affairs, but also incites hackers to attack our network. We are very disappointed (...). Certainly, it is hard to believe this thirty-hour long persistent online attack was not an organized operation. If not for the absence of the air defense alarm, I would have believed that China had declared war against us\" (Wu 2007).\nAs opposed to Indonesia assumption, the Chinese government was not involved in the cyber-attacks against Indonesia. On the contrary, Chinese patriotic hackers launched the attacks on their own initiative by forming the Chinese Hacker Emergency Conference Centre in order to \"set a course of action against Indonesia\" (Denning 2011, Henderson 2007, Wu 2007). Twenty years ago, patriotic hackers were able to alter China's politics. They forced the Chinese government to react. Wu emphasizes that patriotic hackers have the potential to even \"transform China's political structure\" (Wu 2007). Cyber proxies are \"now far better situated to influence political outcomes, even within the international area\" (Hang 2014). Therewith, they constitute an internal threat to nation states. Cyber proxies are powerful actors, supporting them means that they are directed \"away from operating against the state\" (Hang 2014). Because of that domestic political control, China for instance, supports patriotic hackers: \"The People's Republic of China supports Patriotic Hacker attacks to control Patriotic\n371\nJanine Schmoldt\nHackers through fostering nationalism among hackers” (Hang 2014). Next to China also other states such as North Korea or Iran work with cyber proxies. And “even more authoritarian governments have decided that it is better to work with rather than against Patriotic Hackers” (Hang 2014). Through this support, cyber proxies will become more powerful (Hang 2014) because they also benefit from the states.\n## 4. The benefits cyber proxies gain from states\nIndeed, cyber proxies also benefit from the support they receive from states. Borghard and Lonergan illustrate that “cyber proxies receive asymmetrically greater benefits from governments than the reverse” (Borghard, Lonergan 2016). Through the support of nation states, cyber proxies are able to finance themselves. Furthermore, they can enhance their technical skills through valuable equipment, including soft- and hardware. The fact, that states work with cyber proxies rather than sanction them shows clearly that states somehow also offer legal protection. In exchange for launching cyber-attacks and/or operations, states can provide money or employment. We must be keenly aware of\n“the magnitude of the financial incentive for cyber proxies, both in terms of direct transfers of money to groups from the state, and the indirect, but more lucrative, benefit to groups of being able to continue to conduct illegal activities in cyber space” (Borghard, Lonergan 2016).\nStates can also provide valuable hard- and software “that may be very expensive or over which they may have a monopoly” (Borghard, Lonergan 2016). With this equipment, cyber proxies can exploit and test their capabilities or even develop other malware and viruses. Except equipment, states “can grant cyber proxies access to the full range of the Internet itself – states can remove restrictions, such as unfettered access and increased bandwidth, enabling the platform to function on an advantageous way for proxies” (Borghard, Lonergan 2016). Furthermore, states can also help to train other cyber proxies, they can “transfer technical knowhow” and even “provide information that can be used to exploit existing vulnerabilities” (Borghard, Lonergan 2016). Therewith, cyber proxies and hackers elevate their political role and they get a voice within the political arena. Operation Allied Force illustrates that cyber proxies can force states to react in the way the proxies want them to. Hackers already have the power to direct states and to influence a political outcome. During Operation Allied Force, the NATO air war against Yugoslavia during the Kosovo War in 1999, the Chinese embassy in Belgrade became accidentally the target of a bombing. As a result, Chinese patriotic hackers conducted cyber-attacks against the U.S. Therewith, “[t]he war in Kosovo has intensified as hackers on either side of the conflict try to take over or block Web servers around the world (...)” (Messmer 1999). This “cyber self-defense war” (Wu 2007) was also a factor why “Washington agreed to pay $28 million for property damage, $4.5 million to the families of the killed and injured, and in April 2000 fired one CIA operations officer involved in the targeting” (Lampton 2002). But the NATO campaign also illustrates another fact: Cyber Proxies or patriotic hackers get active in armed conflicts in order to support their homeland. The Russo-Georgian war of 2008 similarly illustrates that patriotic hackers are involved by conducting cyber-attacks against Georgia in order to defend Russia (Tikk, Kaska, Vihul 2010). In the same year, patriotic hackers were involved in Operation Cast Lead and in Operation Pillar of Cloud during the Gaza War between Palestinians and Israel where they stole lists with contact information of soldiers and reservists and warned them in joining the war (Dahan 2013). The Second Lebanon war, the tensions between Israel and Iran as well as the current conflict in Syria also illustrate that patriotic hackers are involved in armed conflicts. This shows clearly that in theory, international conflicts no longer require a state or state sanction. Cyber proxies from different states fight or hack against each other without governmental direction. The hacker war following the collision of the US EP-3 reconnaissance aircraft and a Chinese F-8 PRC fighter as well the cyber-attacks against Indonesia illustrate this. Cyber proxies can also threaten the internal affairs of a state and therewith the stability of states. All in all, the state’s assistance will enhance the proxies technical and “elevate these hackers into a more prominent political role” (Hang 2014). Rather than sanctioning the illegal activities, states “offer safe haven to cyber proxy groups, both in granting physical security within a state’s sovereign territory, as well as legal protections” (Borghard, Lonergan 2016). Almost all cyber proxies operate outside of the domestic (and international) legal rules and are therefore, susceptible to prosecution and jail. By working with cyber proxies, states are aware of the fact that they refrain from enforcing existing law.\n## 5. States, proxies and international law\nStates are aware of the activities of the proxies and tolerate them “in spite of having the capacity to do otherwise” (Maurer 2018). In these situations, the states are “clearly turning a blind eye to the proxies’ offensive actions” (Maurer 2018). This however, leads to the question of whether states can be held responsible for the\n372\nJanine Schmoldt\nactions of the cyber proxies under international law. The International Law Commission’s Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts make clear:\n“The conduct of a person or group of persons shall be considered an act of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct” (International Law Commission 2001, Article 8).\nThus, the actions of cyber proxies are attributable to the state if the hacker is acting under the instruction or direction or control of a State. The degree of control that must be exercised was a key issue for the International Court of Justice (hereafter ICJ) in a Case Concerning the Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States of America). The question was\n“whether or not the relationship of the contras to the United States Government was so much one of dependence on the one side and control on the other that it would be right to equate the contras, for legal purposes, with an organ of the United States Government, or as acting on behalf of that Government” (International Court of Justice 1986, para.109).\nThe Court applied what has later been called the effective control test. A State can only be held responsible for the acts of non-state actors if the State “directed or enforced” (International Court of Justice 1986, para. 115) the non-state actor. The ICJ thus\n“Decides that the United States of America, by training, arming, equipping, financing and supplying the contra forces or otherwise encouraging, supporting and aiding military and paramilitary activities in and against Nicaragua, has acted, against the Republic of Nicaragua, in breach of its obligation under customary international law not to intervene in the affairs of another State” (International Court of Justice 1986, para.3).\nThe Appeals Chamber of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia has also addressed the degree of control over non-state actors by making clear:\n“One should distinguish the situation of individuals acting on behalf of a State without specific instructions, from that of individuals making up an organised and hierarchically structured group, (...) Consequently, for the attribution to a State of acts of these groups it is sufficient to require that the group as a whole be under the overall control of the State” (International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia 1999, para. 120).\nSpecific instructions are not required for the actions of individuals, as opposed to the effective control test, where specific instructions or directions concerning the performance of an action are required in order to attribute the action to a state. The Chamber thus identified another degree of control, namely the overall control test:\n“In order to attribute the acts of a military or paramilitary group to a State, it must be proved that the State wields overall control over the group, not only by equipping and financing the group, but also by coordinating or helping in the general planning of its military activity. Only then can the State be held internationally accountable for any misconduct of the group” (International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia 1999, para. 131).\nIn the case of cyber proxies, it seems clear, that states have effective and/or overall control over the proxies, especially through the relationship of delegation, orchestration, and sanctioning. States can be held responsible for the actions of a cyber proxies under international law if they have effective and/or overall control or more precisely, if the cyber proxy is acting on the instructions, direction, or control of that state.\n## 6. Conclusion\nMore and more states work with cyber proxies due to three facts. First, cyber proxies avoid attribution and provide plausible deniability. Therewith, they protect states from the legal consequence that (illegal) cyber operations may cause. Second, cyber proxies enhance the cyber warfare capabilities of states when they lack offensive cyber capabilities. Third, cyber proxies co-opt threats as states gain a certain degree of control over the hacker through which they can direct cyber proxies away from launching cyber-attacks against the state. On the other hand, cyber proxies receive greater benefits from states which lead to the fact that their power will inevitably grow. By gaining a state’s support, cyber proxies can finance themselves and enhance their technical skills. Therewith, cyber proxies can not only develop new tools they can also train other hackers. Furthermore,\n373\nJanine Schmoldt\nstates offer legal protection with the result, that hackers will not be prosecuted for illegal cyber operations. However, states who work with cyber proxies are responsible for the actions and operations of the proxies, if the proxies are acting on the instructions, directions, or overall and/or effective control of that state. All in all, cyber proxies get “a seat at the table of political change” (Hang 2014). Cyber proxies can already threaten the internal affairs of a state and therewith the stability of states as past cyberwars have shown."

The cyber-attacks against Estonia illustrate this. Indeed, Russian patriotic hacker Konstantin Goloskokov has claimed responsibility for the cyber operations. However, the attacks “were in part attributable to the Nashi youth activist group, but it is unclear whether the Russian Federation had a hand in the group’s operations” (Schmitt, Vihul 2014). Related to this, Michael Schmitt and Liis Vihul point out that\nJanine Schmoldt\n\"the relatively high levels of support that are required before a state can be held responsible for the activities of non-state groups or individuals, as distinct from their own responsibility for being involved, creates a normative safe zone for them\" (Schmitt, Vihul 2014).\nAlthough cyber proxies provide plausible deniability, not all states want that as the 2001 cyber-attacks against the U.S. illustrate. In 2001, following the collision of a US EP-3 reconnaissance aircraft and a Chinese F-8 PRC fighter cyber-attack were related to the U.S. (Wu 2007). During this event, the Chinese government was \"not concerned with denying its responsibility for cyber-attacks\" (Hang 2014). On the contrary, \"the Chinese government encouraged computer-savvy citizens to deface American websites to express their displeasure\" (Hang 2014). Similarly, in 1999, when Taiwanese President Li Teng-Hui advocated his two-state-theory China again \"launched the Patriotic Hackers and encouraged other hackers to join during the next crisis with Taiwan\" (Hang 2014). Nevertheless, cyber proxies are used to maintain plausible deniability. Next to that, they also enhance the cyber warfare capabilities of states.\nAnother reason why states work with cyber proxies is to increase their cyber warfare capabilities. This \"can ensure its ascent to a future superpower status\" (Hjortdal 2011). Cyber proxies are especially relevant for states \"when they lack the capability (...) to conduct offensive cyber attacks\" (Borghard, Lonergan 2016). North Korea for instance \"is incentivized to work with cyber proxies because it lacks indigenous capabilities to conduct independent offensive operations\" (Borghard, Lonergan 2016). Furthermore, states use cyber proxies in order \"to respond to an external threat (i.e., a state adversary)\" (Borghard, Lonergan 2016) or to an internal one. In many cases, cyber warfare capabilities constitute an external threat. The United States for instance threatens China through their cyber warfare capabilities and therewith, they constitute an external threat for China. Because of that, China uses cyber proxies in order to \"ensure eventual strategic parity with the United States in technological and military prowess\" (Hjortdal 2011). However, states also use cyber proxies \"to co-opt potential threats to the regime, employing domestic groups that my pose a risk to regime stability to operate against adversaries, thus enabling the government to monitor those groups and keep them occupied\" (Borghard, Lonergan 2016). This directly leads to the next reason why states use cyber proxies.\nThrough the support of cyber proxies states have a certain degree of control through which they can direct cyber proxies away from launching cyber-attacks against the state. Cyber proxies such as patriotic hackers constitute an internal threat especially to China. The cyber-attacks against Indonesia illustrate this. In 1998, many ethnic Chinese living in Indonesia were killed and raped. This constitutes a big dilemma to the Chinese government. One the one hand, the Chinese government could not accept the assaults towards the Chinese ethnicity. But on the other hand, their \"long term foreign policy stance has been not to interfere with other countries internal affairs, and not to be meddled in by foreign powers\" (Wu 2007). Wu highlights: \"If not for the Internet, the Chinese government might have been able to turn a deaf ear toward it and hope it gradually died down\" (Wu 2007). However, Chinese patriotic hackers took \"justice into their own hands\" (Wu 2007) and launched cyber-attacks against Indonesia. Already in 1998 after the Indonesian cyber-attacks, patriotic hackers were able to make Indonesia believe that China declared war. During a press conference on 9 August 1998, the Indonesian government made clear:\n\"We hope Chinese people can keep calm. The past events are our internal affairs. Today, Chinese hackers are coming and we are confused. They are interfering in our problems. Chinese government not only interferes with our internal affairs, but also incites hackers to attack our network. We are very disappointed (...). Certainly, it is hard to believe this thirty-hour long persistent online attack was not an organized operation. If not for the absence of the air defense alarm, I would have believed that China had declared war against us\" (Wu 2007).\nAs opposed to Indonesia assumption, the Chinese government was not involved in the cyber-attacks against Indonesia. On the contrary, Chinese patriotic hackers launched the attacks on their own initiative by forming the Chinese Hacker Emergency Conference Centre in order to \"set a course of action against Indonesia\" (Denning 2011, Henderson 2007, Wu 2007). Twenty years ago, patriotic hackers were able to alter China's politics. They forced the Chinese government to react. Wu emphasizes that patriotic hackers have the potential to even \"transform China's political structure\" (Wu 2007). Cyber proxies are \"now far better situated to influence political outcomes, even within the international area\" (Hang 2014). Therewith, they constitute an internal threat to nation states. Cyber proxies are powerful actors, supporting them means that they are directed \"away from operating against the state\" (Hang 2014). Because of that domestic political control, China for instance, supports patriotic hackers: \"The People's Republic of China supports Patriotic Hacker attacks to control Patriotic\n371\nJanine Schmoldt\nHackers through fostering nationalism among hackers” (Hang 2014). Next to China also other states such as North Korea or Iran work with cyber proxies. And “even more authoritarian governments have decided that it is better to work with rather than against Patriotic Hackers” (Hang 2014). Through this support, cyber proxies will become more powerful (Hang 2014) because they also benefit from the states.\n## 4. The benefits cyber proxies gain from states\nIndeed, cyber proxies also benefit from the support they receive from states. Borghard and Lonergan illustrate that “cyber proxies receive asymmetrically greater benefits from governments than the reverse” (Borghard, Lonergan 2016). Through the support of nation states, cyber proxies are able to finance themselves. Furthermore, they can enhance their technical skills through valuable equipment, including soft- and hardware. The fact, that states work with cyber proxies rather than sanction them shows clearly that states somehow also offer legal protection. In exchange for launching cyber-attacks and/or operations, states can provide money or employment. We must be keenly aware of\n“the magnitude of the financial incentive for cyber proxies, both in terms of direct transfers of money to groups from the state, and the indirect, but more lucrative, benefit to groups of being able to continue to conduct illegal activities in cyber space” (Borghard, Lonergan 2016).\nStates can also provide valuable hard- and software “that may be very expensive or over which they may have a monopoly” (Borghard, Lonergan 2016). With this equipment, cyber proxies can exploit and test their capabilities or even develop other malware and viruses. Except equipment, states “can grant cyber proxies access to the full range of the Internet itself – states can remove restrictions, such as unfettered access and increased bandwidth, enabling the platform to function on an advantageous way for proxies” (Borghard, Lonergan 2016). Furthermore, states can also help to train other cyber proxies, they can “transfer technical knowhow” and even “provide information that can be used to exploit existing vulnerabilities” (Borghard, Lonergan 2016). Therewith, cyber proxies and hackers elevate their political role and they get a voice within the political arena. Operation Allied Force illustrates that cyber proxies can force states to react in the way the proxies want them to. Hackers already have the power to direct states and to influence a political outcome. During Operation Allied Force, the NATO air war against Yugoslavia during the Kosovo War in 1999, the Chinese embassy in Belgrade became accidentally the target of a bombing. As a result, Chinese patriotic hackers conducted cyber-attacks against the U.S. Therewith, “[t]he war in Kosovo has intensified as hackers on either side of the conflict try to take over or block Web servers around the world (...)” (Messmer 1999). This “cyber self-defense war” (Wu 2007) was also a factor why “Washington agreed to pay $28 million for property damage, $4.5 million to the families of the killed and injured, and in April 2000 fired one CIA operations officer involved in the targeting” (Lampton 2002). But the NATO campaign also illustrates another fact: Cyber Proxies or patriotic hackers get active in armed conflicts in order to support their homeland. The Russo-Georgian war of 2008 similarly illustrates that patriotic hackers are involved by conducting cyber-attacks against Georgia in order to defend Russia (Tikk, Kaska, Vihul 2010). In the same year, patriotic hackers were involved in Operation Cast Lead and in Operation Pillar of Cloud during the Gaza War between Palestinians and Israel where they stole lists with contact information of soldiers and reservists and warned them in joining the war (Dahan 2013). The Second Lebanon war, the tensions between Israel and Iran as well as the current conflict in Syria also illustrate that patriotic hackers are involved in armed conflicts. This shows clearly that in theory, international conflicts no longer require a state or state sanction. Cyber proxies from different states fight or hack against each other without governmental direction. The hacker war following the collision of the US EP-3 reconnaissance aircraft and a Chinese F-8 PRC fighter as well the cyber-attacks against Indonesia illustrate this. Cyber proxies can also threaten the internal affairs of a state and therewith the stability of states. All in all, the state’s assistance will enhance the proxies technical and “elevate these hackers into a more prominent political role” (Hang 2014). Rather than sanctioning the illegal activities, states “offer safe haven to cyber proxy groups, both in granting physical security within a state’s sovereign territory, as well as legal protections” (Borghard, Lonergan 2016). Almost all cyber proxies operate outside of the domestic (and international) legal rules and are therefore, susceptible to prosecution and jail. By working with cyber proxies, states are aware of the fact that they refrain from enforcing existing law.\n## 5. States, proxies and international law\nStates are aware of the activities of the proxies and tolerate them “in spite of having the capacity to do otherwise” (Maurer 2018). In these situations, the states are “clearly turning a blind eye to the proxies’ offensive actions” (Maurer 2018). This however, leads to the question of whether states can be held responsible for the\n372\nJanine Schmoldt\nactions of the cyber proxies under international law. The International Law Commission’s Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts make clear:\n“The conduct of a person or group of persons shall be considered an act of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct” (International Law Commission 2001, Article 8).\nThus, the actions of cyber proxies are attributable to the state if the hacker is acting under the instruction or direction or control of a State. The degree of control that must be exercised was a key issue for the International Court of Justice (hereafter ICJ) in a Case Concerning the Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States of America). The question was\n“whether or not the relationship of the contras to the United States Government was so much one of dependence on the one side and control on the other that it would be right to equate the contras, for legal purposes, with an organ of the United States Government, or as acting on behalf of that Government” (International Court of Justice 1986, para.109).\nThe Court applied what has later been called the effective control test. A State can only be held responsible for the acts of non-state actors if the State “directed or enforced” (International Court of Justice 1986, para. 115) the non-state actor. The ICJ thus\n“Decides that the United States of America, by training, arming, equipping, financing and supplying the contra forces or otherwise encouraging, supporting and aiding military and paramilitary activities in and against Nicaragua, has acted, against the Republic of Nicaragua, in breach of its obligation under customary international law not to intervene in the affairs of another State” (International Court of Justice 1986, para.3).\nThe Appeals Chamber of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia has also addressed the degree of control over non-state actors by making clear:\n“One should distinguish the situation of individuals acting on behalf of a State without specific instructions, from that of individuals making up an organised and hierarchically structured group, (...) Consequently, for the attribution to a State of acts of these groups it is sufficient to require that the group as a whole be under the overall control of the State” (International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia 1999, para. 120).\nSpecific instructions are not required for the actions of individuals, as opposed to the effective control test, where specific instructions or directions concerning the performance of an action are required in order to attribute the action to a state. The Chamber thus identified another degree of control, namely the overall control test:\n“In order to attribute the acts of a military or paramilitary group to a State, it must be proved that the State wields overall control over the group, not only by equipping and financing the group, but also by coordinating or helping in the general planning of its military activity. Only then can the State be held internationally accountable for any misconduct of the group” (International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia 1999, para. 131).\nIn the case of cyber proxies, it seems clear, that states have effective and/or overall control over the proxies, especially through the relationship of delegation, orchestration, and sanctioning. States can be held responsible for the actions of a cyber proxies under international law if they have effective and/or overall control or more precisely, if the cyber proxy is acting on the instructions, direction, or control of that state.\n## 6. Conclusion\nMore and more states work with cyber proxies due to three facts. First, cyber proxies avoid attribution and provide plausible deniability. Therewith, they protect states from the legal consequence that (illegal) cyber operations may cause. Second, cyber proxies enhance the cyber warfare capabilities of states when they lack offensive cyber capabilities. Third, cyber proxies co-opt threats as states gain a certain degree of control over the hacker through which they can direct cyber proxies away from launching cyber-attacks against the state. On the other hand, cyber proxies receive greater benefits from states which lead to the fact that their power will inevitably grow. By gaining a state’s support, cyber proxies can finance themselves and enhance their technical skills. Therewith, cyber proxies can not only develop new tools they can also train other hackers. Furthermore,\n373\nJanine Schmoldt\nstates offer legal protection with the result, that hackers will not be prosecuted for illegal cyber operations. However, states who work with cyber proxies are responsible for the actions and operations of the proxies, if the proxies are acting on the instructions, directions, or overall and/or effective control of that state. All in all, cyber proxies get “a seat at the table of political change” (Hang 2014). Cyber proxies can already threaten the internal affairs of a state and therewith the stability of states as past cyberwars have shown."

States work with proxies rather than sanctioning them. This is because cyber proxies are incredibly useful – they not only enhance the cyber warfare capabilities of the supporting states, they also provide them with a degree of plausible deniability. This ascent a future superpower status. China for instance uses cyber proxies in order to\"deter the United States (...) which may ensure eventual strategic parity with the United States in technological and military prowess\". Simultaneously, cyber proxies are seen as an inherent threat to the stability of nation states as they are capable of subverting the national and political stability. Is then the support of cyber proxies not inconsistent with the aim to limit potential threats to the stability of nation states? Through the support of nation states, cyber proxies can enhance their technical skills with the result, that they elevate their political role. Cyber proxies have become extremely powerful, supporting them means that they are directed\"away from operating against the state\". Thus, even more governments have decided that it is better to work with rather than against cyber proxies. But this also leads to the question of whether states can be held responsible under international law for the actions of the cyber proxies and hackers.\nKeywords: cyber proxies, cyberwarfare, patriotic hackers, international law # 1. Introduction Technology now controls our daily life to an unprecedented level from water supplies, communication, electricity generation and almost every aspect of our western developed culture\"making it increasingly susceptible to computer network attacks and other cyber operations during armed conflicts\"(Harrison Dinniss 2013). Those computer network attacks have already been launched by patriotic hackers. One of the earliest instances of patriotic hacking can be found in the Kosovo war when pro-Serbian (or anti-Western) hackers, such as the so-called Black Hand, conducted cyber-attacks against NATO, UK and US computers with the goal of disrupting their military operations by deleting all data. But the Black Hand was not the only hacker group that launched cyber-attacks during the Kosovo conflict. Chinese patriotic hackers also conducted cyber-attacks after a U.S. B-2 stealth bomber dropped five precision-guided munitions on the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade. Because of the hackers' involvement in the conflict,\"[t]he war in Kosovo has intensified as hackers on either side of the conflict try to take over or block Web servers around the world\". The hackers not only launch cyber-attacks on their own initiative, they were also used as\"proxies to mount cyber-attacks by nation states [such as North Korea or Iran] (...). Tim Maurer also makes clear:\"To project cyber power, (...) states rely on hackers that do not wear uniforms and are not part of the intelligence community – cyber mercenaries or, more badly, cyber proxies\". Yet, the United Nations General Assembly Document A/68/98* of 2013, emphasizes that\"States must not use proxies to commit internationally wrongful acts. States should seek to ensure that their territories are not used by non-State actors for unlawful use of ICTs\"(UN General Assembly 2013). Although 15 nation states, including China, the United States, France and Russia agreed on this, cyber proxies are still used. Nation states support proxies rather than sanctioning them. And even more governments have decided that it is better to work with hackers and cyber proxies although their power inevitably grows. China for instance, inevitably made clear that their cyber proxies and patriotic are\"a powerful threat to the Chinese government because they are a large politically active organization capable of subverting Chinese political stability\". This clearly shows that the use of cyber proxies introduces risks such as the principal-agent problem:\"The further detached an agent from a principal's control, the higher the risk that the agent carries out an action that the principal did not intend\". Because of that, several questions arise: (1) Why do states (still) use cyber proxies? (2) Are the states aware of the risks of using cyber proxies? (3) Are states responsible for the actions of their cyber proxies under international law? The aim of this article is to answer these questions in order to shed light on the current role of cyber proxies. But before discussing the questions, the first part will present a definition of cyber proxies and give a brief literature overview. Afterwards, the second part will then elaborate why states use cyber proxies. The third part then describes how the power of cyber proxies rise through their state-relationship before a last part will deal with the question of whether states can be held responsible for the actions of cyber proxies under international law.\nJanine Schmoldt ## 2. Literature review and definitions It is meanwhile a common belief that hackers constitute a new type of actor in International Relations and International Politics. Particularly in political conflicts, there is often talk about accompanying cyber-attacks conducted by hacker groups where it is unclear how their activities link to the state. Erica Borghard and Shawn Lonergan recently illustrate that states “often form relationships with cyber proxies when they lack an independent ability to conduct cyber operations and/or seek plausibly to deny involvement in a cyber operation” (Borghard, Lonergan 2016). Thereby, states, governments and the hackers themselves “mutually benefit from establishing a relationship, although the specific nature of the goods and services being exchanged varies” (Borghard, Lonergan 2016). Governments could get political and material goods provided by cyber proxies. Through cyber proxies, states can “achieve objectives indirectly, thus shielding governments from political stakeholders who may shy away from direct action” (Borghard, Lonergan 2016). Cyber proxies also offer “political benefits to governments who may want to deny their involvement in a particular operation or even domain” (Borghard, Lonergan 2016). Thus, they provide governments with political goods. In terms of material goods, cyber proxies can offer the technical ability to launch cyber-attacks, “including the manpower” (Borghard, Lonergan 2016). Tim Maurer states that “most states’ proxy relationships fall into one of three main types: delegation, orchestration, and sanctioning”. While the delegation concept describes “proxies on a tight leash with the state and under the state’s effective control”, orchestration means that proxies receive equipment, funding, or other tools “but no specific instructions”. A “shared ideological bond” is crucial for the concept of orchestration. Sanctioning “builds on the counterterrorism literature’s concept of passive support”. This topic also found its way into international law debates. Michael Schmitt and Liis Vihul as well as the Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operation for instance dealt with questions of attribution in cyberspace and when cyber activities of hackers and cyber proxies may “be attributed to a state as a matter of international law” (Schmitt, Vihul 2014). Yet, this contribution will also use an international law approach in order to analyse the state responsibility for the actions of their cyber proxies. But before addressing the relationship of states and cyber proxies, it is, however, important to understand what is meant by cyber proxies. By tending towards Erica Borghard’s and Shawn Lonergan’s definition, this contribution regards cyber proxies as non-state hackers who conduct cyber-attacks or cyber operations in order to achieve “a political objective on behalf of a patron state” (Borghard, Lonergan 2016). It is also important to point out that cyber proxies “can be either individuals or loosely organized units comprised of patriotic hackers, hacktivists or cyber terrorists” (Borghard, Lonergan 2016). Yet, this contribution will focus on patriotic hackers as cyber proxies since they have a greater impact than hacktivists or cyber terrorists. In contrast to hacktivists, patriotic hackers not only engage in civil disobedience, they also get active in actual armed conflicts. Driven by patriotism, patriotic hackers hack with the aim to defend their homeland or national pride whereas hacktivists are essentially activists who are driven by the defence of a political or social issue that does not touch upon their home country or residence. Having said this, we can now focus on the state-proxy relationship.\n## 3. The benefits states gain from cyber proxies More and more states use cyber proxies because cyber proxies are incredibly useful – they not only enhance the cyber warfare capabilities of the supporting states, they also provide them with a degree of plausible deniability. Cyber proxies are able to avoid attribution as they can launch cyber operations “with little or no attribution”. Scott Applegate illustrates that “[t]hese types of attacks can be carried out inexpensively, with little or no political ramifications to the nation-state, and give the attacker a distinct asymmetric advantage. If a nationstate can covertly initiate, fund, or guide such attacks, (...) [relying on cyber proxies] they can potentially achieve their political objectives without the burden of attribution or the need to adhere to the Law of Armed Conflict”.\nTherewith, cyber proxies protect governments from the legal consequence of conducting cyber-attacks. Similarly, they also shift the problem of attribution. The problem is no longer ‘who carried out the attack’ but rather ‘does the state have/had control and command over the cyber proxies’. The cyber-attacks against Estonia illustrate this. Indeed, Russian patriotic hacker Konstantin Goloskokov has claimed responsibility for the cyber operations. However, the attacks “were in part attributable to the Nashi youth activist group, but it is unclear whether the Russian Federation had a hand in the group’s operations” (Schmitt, Vihul 2014). Related to this, Michael Schmitt and Liis Vihul point out that Janine Schmoldt\"the relatively high levels of support that are required before a state can be held responsible for the activities of non-state groups or individuals, as distinct from their own responsibility for being involved, creates a normative safe zone for them\"(Schmitt, Vihul 2014).\nAlthough cyber proxies provide plausible deniability, not all states want that as the 2001 cyber-attacks against the U.S. illustrate. In 2001, following the collision of a US EP-3 reconnaissance aircraft and a Chinese F-8 PRC fighter cyber-attack were related to the U.S.. During this event, the Chinese government was\"not concerned with denying its responsibility for cyber-attacks\". On the contrary,\"the Chinese government encouraged computer-savvy citizens to deface American websites to express their displeasure\". Similarly, in 1999, when Taiwanese President Li Teng-Hui advocated his two-state-theory China again\"launched the Patriotic Hackers and encouraged other hackers to join during the next crisis with Taiwan\". Nevertheless, cyber proxies are used to maintain plausible deniability. Next to that, they also enhance the cyber warfare capabilities of states.\nAnother reason why states work with cyber proxies is to increase their cyber warfare capabilities. This\"can ensure its ascent to a future superpower status\". Cyber proxies are especially relevant for states\"when they lack the capability (...) to conduct offensive cyber attacks\"(Borghard, Lonergan 2016). North Korea for instance\"is incentivized to work with cyber proxies because it lacks indigenous capabilities to conduct independent offensive operations\"(Borghard, Lonergan 2016). Furthermore, states use cyber proxies in order\"to respond to an external threat (i.e., a state adversary)\"(Borghard, Lonergan 2016) or to an internal one. In many cases, cyber warfare capabilities constitute an external threat. The United States for instance threatens China through their cyber warfare capabilities and therewith, they constitute an external threat for China. Because of that, China uses cyber proxies in order to\"ensure eventual strategic parity with the United States in technological and military prowess\". However, states also use cyber proxies\"to co-opt potential threats to the regime, employing domestic groups that my pose a risk to regime stability to operate against adversaries, thus enabling the government to monitor those groups and keep them occupied\"(Borghard, Lonergan 2016). This directly leads to the next reason why states use cyber proxies.\nThrough the support of cyber proxies states have a certain degree of control through which they can direct cyber proxies away from launching cyber-attacks against the state. Cyber proxies such as patriotic hackers constitute an internal threat especially to China. The cyber-attacks against Indonesia illustrate this. In 1998, many ethnic Chinese living in Indonesia were killed and raped. This constitutes a big dilemma to the Chinese government. One the one hand, the Chinese government could not accept the assaults towards the Chinese ethnicity. But on the other hand, their\"long term foreign policy stance has been not to interfere with other countries internal affairs, and not to be meddled in by foreign powers\". Wu highlights:\"If not for the Internet, the Chinese government might have been able to turn a deaf ear toward it and hope it gradually died down\". However, Chinese patriotic hackers took\"justice into their own hands\"and launched cyber-attacks against Indonesia. Already in 1998 after the Indonesian cyber-attacks, patriotic hackers were able to make Indonesia believe that China declared war. During a press conference on 9 August 1998, the Indonesian government made clear:\"We hope Chinese people can keep calm. The past events are our internal affairs. Today, Chinese hackers are coming and we are confused. They are interfering in our problems. Chinese government not only interferes with our internal affairs, but also incites hackers to attack our network. We are very disappointed (...). Certainly, it is hard to believe this thirty-hour long persistent online attack was not an organized operation. If not for the absence of the air defense alarm, I would have believed that China had declared war against us\".\nAs opposed to Indonesia assumption, the Chinese government was not involved in the cyber-attacks against Indonesia. On the contrary, Chinese patriotic hackers launched the attacks on their own initiative by forming the Chinese Hacker Emergency Conference Centre in order to\"set a course of action against Indonesia\". Twenty years ago, patriotic hackers were able to alter China's politics. They forced the Chinese government to react. Wu emphasizes that patriotic hackers have the potential to even\"transform China's political structure\". Cyber proxies are\"now far better situated to influence political outcomes, even within the international area\". Therewith, they constitute an internal threat to nation states. Cyber proxies are powerful actors, supporting them means that they are directed\"away from operating against the state\". Because of that domestic political control, China for instance, supports patriotic hackers:\"The People's Republic of China supports Patriotic Hacker attacks to control Patriotic Hackers through fostering nationalism among hackers”. Next to China also other states such as North Korea or Iran work with cyber proxies. And “even more authoritarian governments have decided that it is better to work with rather than against Patriotic Hackers”. Through this support, cyber proxies will become more powerful because they also benefit from the states.\n## 4. The benefits cyber proxies gain from states Indeed, cyber proxies also benefit from the support they receive from states. Borghard and Lonergan illustrate that “cyber proxies receive asymmetrically greater benefits from governments than the reverse” (Borghard, Lonergan 2016). Through the support of nation states, cyber proxies are able to finance themselves. Furthermore, they can enhance their technical skills through valuable equipment, including soft- and hardware. The fact, that states work with cyber proxies rather than sanction them shows clearly that states somehow also offer legal protection. In exchange for launching cyber-attacks and/or operations, states can provide money or employment. We must be keenly aware of “the magnitude of the financial incentive for cyber proxies, both in terms of direct transfers of money to groups from the state, and the indirect, but more lucrative, benefit to groups of being able to continue to conduct illegal activities in cyber space” (Borghard, Lonergan 2016).\nStates can also provide valuable hard- and software “that may be very expensive or over which they may have a monopoly” (Borghard, Lonergan 2016). With this equipment, cyber proxies can exploit and test their capabilities or even develop other malware and viruses. Except equipment, states “can grant cyber proxies access to the full range of the Internet itself – states can remove restrictions, such as unfettered access and increased bandwidth, enabling the platform to function on an advantageous way for proxies” (Borghard, Lonergan 2016). Furthermore, states can also help to train other cyber proxies, they can “transfer technical knowhow” and even “provide information that can be used to exploit existing vulnerabilities” (Borghard, Lonergan 2016). Therewith, cyber proxies and hackers elevate their political role and they get a voice within the political arena. Operation Allied Force illustrates that cyber proxies can force states to react in the way the proxies want them to. Hackers already have the power to direct states and to influence a political outcome. During Operation Allied Force, the NATO air war against Yugoslavia during the Kosovo War in 1999, the Chinese embassy in Belgrade became accidentally the target of a bombing. As a result, Chinese patriotic hackers conducted cyber-attacks against the U.S. Therewith, “[t]he war in Kosovo has intensified as hackers on either side of the conflict try to take over or block Web servers around the world (...)”. This “cyber self-defense war” was also a factor why “Washington agreed to pay $28 million for property damage, $4.5 million to the families of the killed and injured, and in April 2000 fired one CIA operations officer involved in the targeting”. But the NATO campaign also illustrates another fact: Cyber Proxies or patriotic hackers get active in armed conflicts in order to support their homeland. The Russo-Georgian war of 2008 similarly illustrates that patriotic hackers are involved by conducting cyber-attacks against Georgia in order to defend Russia (Tikk, Kaska, Vihul 2010). In the same year, patriotic hackers were involved in Operation Cast Lead and in Operation Pillar of Cloud during the Gaza War between Palestinians and Israel where they stole lists with contact information of soldiers and reservists and warned them in joining the war. The Second Lebanon war, the tensions between Israel and Iran as well as the current conflict in Syria also illustrate that patriotic hackers are involved in armed conflicts. This shows clearly that in theory, international conflicts no longer require a state or state sanction. Cyber proxies from different states fight or hack against each other without governmental direction. The hacker war following the collision of the US EP-3 reconnaissance aircraft and a Chinese F-8 PRC fighter as well the cyber-attacks against Indonesia illustrate this. Cyber proxies can also threaten the internal affairs of a state and therewith the stability of states. All in all, the state’s assistance will enhance the proxies technical and “elevate these hackers into a more prominent political role”. Rather than sanctioning the illegal activities, states “offer safe haven to cyber proxy groups, both in granting physical security within a state’s sovereign territory, as well as legal protections” (Borghard, Lonergan 2016). Almost all cyber proxies operate outside of the domestic (and international) legal rules and are therefore, susceptible to prosecution and jail. By working with cyber proxies, states are aware of the fact that they refrain from enforcing existing law.\n## 5. States, proxies and international law States are aware of the activities of the proxies and tolerate them “in spite of having the capacity to do otherwise”. In these situations, the states are “clearly turning a blind eye to the proxies’ offensive actions”. This however, leads to the question of whether states can be held responsible for the actions of the cyber proxies under international law. The International Law Commission’s Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts make clear: “The conduct of a person or group of persons shall be considered an act of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct” (International Law Commission 2001, Article 8).\nThus, the actions of cyber proxies are attributable to the state if the hacker is acting under the instruction or direction or control of a State. The degree of control that must be exercised was a key issue for the International Court of Justice (hereafter ICJ) in a Case Concerning the Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States of America). The question was “whether or not the relationship of the contras to the United States Government was so much one of dependence on the one side and control on the other that it would be right to equate the contras, for legal purposes, with an organ of the United States Government, or as acting on behalf of that Government” (International Court of Justice 1986, para.109).\nThe Court applied what has later been called the effective control test. A State can only be held responsible for the acts of non-state actors if the State “directed or enforced” (International Court of Justice 1986, para. 115) the non-state actor. The ICJ thus “Decides that the United States of America, by training, arming, equipping, financing and supplying the contra forces or otherwise encouraging, supporting and aiding military and paramilitary activities in and against Nicaragua, has acted, against the Republic of Nicaragua, in breach of its obligation under customary international law not to intervene in the affairs of another State” (International Court of Justice 1986, para.3).\nThe Appeals Chamber of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia has also addressed the degree of control over non-state actors by making clear: “One should distinguish the situation of individuals acting on behalf of a State without specific instructions, from that of individuals making up an organised and hierarchically structured group, (...) Consequently, for the attribution to a State of acts of these groups it is sufficient to require that the group as a whole be under the overall control of the State” (International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia 1999, para. 120).\nSpecific instructions are not required for the actions of individuals, as opposed to the effective control test, where specific instructions or directions concerning the performance of an action are required in order to attribute the action to a state. The Chamber thus identified another degree of control, namely the overall control test: “In order to attribute the acts of a military or paramilitary group to a State, it must be proved that the State wields overall control over the group, not only by equipping and financing the group, but also by coordinating or helping in the general planning of its military activity. Only then can the State be held internationally accountable for any misconduct of the group” (International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia 1999, para. 131).\nIn the case of cyber proxies, it seems clear, that states have effective and/or overall control over the proxies, especially through the relationship of delegation, orchestration, and sanctioning. States can be held responsible for the actions of a cyber proxies under international law if they have effective and/or overall control or more precisely, if the cyber proxy is acting on the instructions, direction, or control of that state.\n## 6. Conclusion More and more states work with cyber proxies due to three facts. First, cyber proxies avoid attribution and provide plausible deniability. Therewith, they protect states from the legal consequence that (illegal) cyber operations may cause. Second, cyber proxies enhance the cyber warfare capabilities of states when they lack offensive cyber capabilities. Third, cyber proxies co-opt threats as states gain a certain degree of control over the hacker through which they can direct cyber proxies away from launching cyber-attacks against the state. On the other hand, cyber proxies receive greater benefits from states which lead to the fact that their power will inevitably grow. By gaining a state’s support, cyber proxies can finance themselves and enhance their technical skills. Therewith, cyber proxies can not only develop new tools they can also train other hackers. Furthermore, states offer legal protection with the result, that hackers will not be prosecuted for illegal cyber operations. However, states who work with cyber proxies are responsible for the actions and operations of the proxies, if the proxies are acting on the instructions, directions, or overall and/or effective control of that state. All in all, cyber proxies get “a seat at the table of political change”. Cyber proxies can already threaten the internal affairs of a state and therewith the stability of states as past cyberwars have shown."

The benefits states gain from cyber proxies More and more states use cyber proxies because cyber proxies are incredibly useful – they not only enhance the cyber warfare capabilities of the supporting states, they also provide them with a degree of plausible deniability. Cyber proxies are able to avoid attribution as they can launch cyber operations “with little or no attribution”. Scott Applegate illustrates that “[t]hese types of attacks can be carried out inexpensively, with little or no political ramifications to the nation-state, and give the attacker a distinct asymmetric advantage. If a nationstate can covertly initiate, fund, or guide such attacks, (...) [relying on cyber proxies] they can potentially achieve their political objectives without the burden of attribution or the need to adhere to the Law of Armed Conflict”.\n\nTherewith, cyber proxies protect governments from the legal consequence of conducting cyber-attacks. Similarly, they also shift the problem of attribution. The problem is no longer ‘who carried out the attack’ but rather ‘does the state have/had control and command over the cyber proxies’. The cyber-attacks against Estonia illustrate this. Indeed, Russian patriotic hacker Konstantin Goloskokov has claimed responsibility for the cyber operations. However, the attacks “were in part attributable to the Nashi youth activist group, but it is unclear whether the Russian Federation had a hand in the group’s operations” (Schmitt, Vihul 2014). Related to this, Michael Schmitt and Liis Vihul point out that Janine Schmoldt\"the relatively high levels of support that are required before a state can be held responsible for the activities of non-state groups or individuals, as distinct from their own responsibility for being involved, creates a normative safe zone for them\"(Schmitt, Vihul 2014).\nAlthough cyber proxies provide plausible deniability, not all states want that as the 2001 cyber-attacks against the U.S. illustrate. In 2001, following the collision of a US EP-3 reconnaissance aircraft and a Chinese F-8 PRC fighter cyber-attack were related to the U.S.. During this event, the Chinese government was\"not concerned with denying its responsibility for cyber-attacks\". On the contrary,\"the Chinese government encouraged computer-savvy citizens to deface American websites to express their displeasure\". Similarly, in 1999, when Taiwanese President Li Teng-Hui advocated his two-state-theory China again\"launched the Patriotic Hackers and encouraged other hackers to join during the next crisis with Taiwan\". Nevertheless, cyber proxies are used to maintain plausible deniability. Next to that, they also enhance the cyber warfare capabilities of states.\nAnother reason why states work with cyber proxies is to increase their cyber warfare capabilities. This\"can ensure its ascent to a future superpower status\". Cyber proxies are especially relevant for states\"when they lack the capability (...) to conduct offensive cyber attacks\"(Borghard, Lonergan 2016). North Korea for instance\"is incentivized to work with cyber proxies because it lacks indigenous capabilities to conduct independent offensive operations\"(Borghard, Lonergan 2016). Furthermore, states use cyber proxies in order\"to respond to an external threat (i.e., a state adversary)\"(Borghard, Lonergan 2016) or to an internal one. In many cases, cyber warfare capabilities constitute an external threat. The United States for instance threatens China through their cyber warfare capabilities and therewith, they constitute an external threat for China. Because of that, China uses cyber proxies in order to\"ensure eventual strategic parity with the United States in technological and military prowess\". However, states also use cyber proxies\"to co-opt potential threats to the regime, employing domestic groups that my pose a risk to regime stability to operate against adversaries, thus enabling the government to monitor those groups and keep them occupied\"(Borghard, Lonergan 2016). This directly leads to the next reason why states use cyber proxies.\nThrough the support of cyber proxies states have a certain degree of control through which they can direct cyber proxies away from launching cyber-attacks against the state. Cyber proxies such as patriotic hackers constitute an internal threat especially to China. The cyber-attacks against Indonesia illustrate this. In 1998, many ethnic Chinese living in Indonesia were killed and raped. This constitutes a big dilemma to the Chinese government. One the one hand, the Chinese government could not accept the assaults towards the Chinese ethnicity. But on the other hand, their\"long term foreign policy stance has been not to interfere with other countries internal affairs, and not to be meddled in by foreign powers\". Wu highlights:\"If not for the Internet, the Chinese government might have been able to turn a deaf ear toward it and hope it gradually died down\". However, Chinese patriotic hackers took\"justice into their own hands\"and launched cyber-attacks against Indonesia. Already in 1998 after the Indonesian cyber-attacks, patriotic hackers were able to make Indonesia believe that China declared war. During a press conference on 9 August 1998, the Indonesian government made clear:\"We hope Chinese people can keep calm. The past events are our internal affairs. Today, Chinese hackers are coming and we are confused. They are interfering in our problems. Chinese government not only interferes with our internal affairs, but also incites hackers to attack our network. We are very disappointed (...). Certainly, it is hard to believe this thirty-hour long persistent online attack was not an organized operation. If not for the absence of the air defense alarm, I would have believed that China had declared war against us\".\nAs opposed to Indonesia assumption, the Chinese government was not involved in the cyber-attacks against Indonesia. On the contrary, Chinese patriotic hackers launched the attacks on their own initiative by forming the Chinese Hacker Emergency Conference Centre in order to\"set a course of action against Indonesia\". Twenty years ago, patriotic hackers were able to alter China's politics. They forced the Chinese government to react. Wu emphasizes that patriotic hackers have the potential to even\"transform China's political structure\". Cyber proxies are\"now far better situated to influence political outcomes, even within the international area\". Therewith, they constitute an internal threat to nation states. Cyber proxies are powerful actors, supporting them means that they are directed\"away from operating against the state\". Because of that domestic political control, China for instance, supports patriotic hackers:\"The People's Republic of China supports Patriotic Hacker attacks to control Patriotic Hackers through fostering nationalism among hackers”. Next to China also other states such as North Korea or Iran work with cyber proxies. And “even more authoritarian governments have decided that it is better to work with rather than against Patriotic Hackers”. Through this support, cyber proxies will become more powerful because they also benefit from the states.\n\n---\n\n## ## 5. States, proxies and international law States are aware of the activities of the proxies and tolerate them “in spite of having the capacity to do otherwise”. In these situations, the states are “clearly turning a blind eye to the proxies’ offensive actions”. This however, leads to the question of whether states can be held responsible for the actions of the cyber proxies under international law. The International Law Commission’s Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts make clear: “The conduct of a person or group of persons shall be considered an act of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct” (International Law Commission 2001, Article 8).\n\nThus, the actions of cyber proxies are attributable to the state if the hacker is acting under the instruction or direction or control of a State. The degree of control that must be exercised was a key issue for the International Court of Justice (hereafter ICJ) in a Case Concerning the Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States of America). The question was “whether or not the relationship of the contras to the United States Government was so much one of dependence on the one side and control on the other that it would be right to equate the contras, for legal purposes, with an organ of the United States Government, or as acting on behalf of that Government” (International Court of Justice 1986, para.109).\nThe Court applied what has later been called the effective control test. A State can only be held responsible for the acts of non-state actors if the State “directed or enforced” (International Court of Justice 1986, para. 115) the non-state actor. The ICJ thus “Decides that the United States of America, by training, arming, equipping, financing and supplying the contra forces or otherwise encouraging, supporting and aiding military and paramilitary activities in and against Nicaragua, has acted, against the Republic of Nicaragua, in breach of its obligation under customary international law not to intervene in the affairs of another State” (International Court of Justice 1986, para.3).\nThe Appeals Chamber of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia has also addressed the degree of control over non-state actors by making clear: “One should distinguish the situation of individuals acting on behalf of a State without specific instructions, from that of individuals making up an organised and hierarchically structured group, (...)

    "369\n\n# The Rising Power of Cyber Proxies\n\nJanine Schmoldt\nUniversity of Erfurt, Faculty of Economics, Law and Social Sciences, Germany\njanine.schmoldt@uni-erfurt.de\n\nDOI: 10.34190/EWS.21.068\n\nAbstract: More and more states support cyber proxies. States work with proxies rather than sanctioning them. This is because cyber proxies are incredibly useful – they not only enhance the cyber warfare capabilities of the supporting states, they also provide them with a degree of plausible deniability. This ascent a future superpower status. China for instance uses cyber proxies in order to \"deter the United States (...) which may ensure eventual strategic parity with the United States in technological and military prowess\" (Hjortdal 2011). Simultaneously, cyber proxies are seen as an inherent threat to the stability of nation states as they are capable of subverting the national and political stability. Is then the support of cyber proxies not inconsistent with the aim to limit potential threats to the stability of nation states? Through the support of nation states, cyber proxies can enhance their technical skills with the result, that they elevate their political role. Cyber proxies have become extremely powerful, supporting them means that they are directed \"away from operating against the state\" (Hang 2014). Thus, even more governments have decided that it is better to work with rather than against cyber proxies. But this also leads to the question of whether states can be held responsible under international law for the actions of the cyber proxies and hackers.\n\nKeywords: cyber proxies, cyberwarfare, patriotic hackers, international law\n\n# 1. Introduction\n\nTechnology now controls our daily life to an unprecedented level from water supplies, communication, electricity generation and almost every aspect of our western developed culture \"making it increasingly susceptible to computer network attacks and other cyber operations during armed conflicts\" (Harrison Dinniss 2013). Those computer network attacks have already been launched by patriotic hackers. One of the earliest instances of patriotic hacking can be found in the Kosovo war when pro-Serbian (or anti-Western) hackers, such as the so-called Black Hand, conducted cyber-attacks against NATO, UK and US computers with the goal of disrupting their military operations by deleting all data (Geers 2017). But the Black Hand was not the only hacker group that launched cyber-attacks during the Kosovo conflict. Chinese patriotic hackers also conducted cyber-attacks after a U.S. B-2 stealth bomber dropped five precision-guided munitions on the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade (Wu 2007). Because of the hackers' involvement in the conflict, \"[t]he war in Kosovo has intensified as hackers on either side of the conflict try to take over or block Web servers around the world\" (Messmer 1999). The hackers not only launch cyber-attacks on their own initiative, they were also used as \"proxies to mount cyber-attacks by nation states [such as North Korea or Iran] (...) (Dahan 2013). Tim Maurer also makes clear: \"To project cyber power, (...) states rely on hackers that do not wear uniforms and are not part of the intelligence community – cyber mercenaries or, more badly, cyber proxies\" (Maurer 2018). Yet, the United Nations General Assembly Document A/68/98* of 2013, emphasizes that \"States must not use proxies to commit internationally wrongful acts. States should seek to ensure that their territories are not used by non-State actors for unlawful use of ICTs\" (UN General Assembly 2013). Although 15 nation states, including China, the United States, France and Russia agreed on this, cyber proxies are still used. Nation states support proxies rather than sanctioning them. And even more governments have decided that it is better to work with hackers and cyber proxies although their power inevitably grows. China for instance, inevitably made clear that their cyber proxies and patriotic are \"a powerful threat to the Chinese government because they are a large politically active organization capable of subverting Chinese political stability\" (Hang 2014). This clearly shows that the use of cyber proxies introduces risks such as the principal-agent problem: \"The further detached an agent from a principal's control, the higher the risk that the agent carries out an action that the principal did not intend\" (Maurer 2018). Because of that, several questions arise: (1) Why do states (still) use cyber proxies? (2) Are the states aware of the risks of using cyber proxies? (3) Are states responsible for the actions of their cyber proxies under international law? The aim of this article is to answer these questions in order to shed light on the current role of cyber proxies. But before discussing the questions, the first part will present a definition of cyber proxies and give a brief literature overview. Afterwards, the second part will then elaborate why states use cyber proxies. The third part then describes how the power of cyber proxies rise through their state-relationship before a last part will deal with the question of whether states can be held responsible for the actions of cyber proxies under international law.",
    "Janine Schmoldt\n\n## 2. Literature review and definitions\n\nIt is meanwhile a common belief that hackers constitute a new type of actor in International Relations and International Politics. Particularly in political conflicts, there is often talk about accompanying cyber-attacks conducted by hacker groups where it is unclear how their activities link to the state. Erica Borghard and Shawn Lonergan recently illustrate that states “often form relationships with cyber proxies when they lack an independent ability to conduct cyber operations and/or seek plausibly to deny involvement in a cyber operation” (Borghard, Lonergan 2016). Thereby, states, governments and the hackers themselves “mutually benefit from establishing a relationship, although the specific nature of the goods and services being exchanged varies” (Borghard, Lonergan 2016). Governments could get political and material goods provided by cyber proxies. Through cyber proxies, states can “achieve objectives indirectly, thus shielding governments from political stakeholders who may shy away from direct action” (Borghard, Lonergan 2016). Cyber proxies also offer “political benefits to governments who may want to deny their involvement in a particular operation or even domain” (Borghard, Lonergan 2016). Thus, they provide governments with political goods. In terms of material goods, cyber proxies can offer the technical ability to launch cyber-attacks, “including the manpower” (Borghard, Lonergan 2016). Tim Maurer states that “most states’ proxy relationships fall into one of three main types: delegation, orchestration, and sanctioning” (Maurer 2018). While the delegation concept describes “proxies on a tight leash with the state and under the state’s effective control” (Maurer 2018), orchestration means that proxies receive equipment, funding, or other tools “but no specific instructions” (Maurer 2018). A “shared ideological bond” (Maurer 2018) is crucial for the concept of orchestration. Sanctioning “builds on the counterterrorism literature’s concept of passive support” (Maurer 2018). This topic also found its way into international law debates. Michael Schmitt and Liis Vihul as well as the Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operation for instance dealt with questions of attribution in cyberspace and when cyber activities of hackers and cyber proxies may “be attributed to a state as a matter of international law” (Schmitt, Vihul 2014). Yet, this contribution will also use an international law approach in order to analyse the state responsibility for the actions of their cyber proxies. But before addressing the relationship of states and cyber proxies, it is, however, important to understand what is meant by cyber proxies. By tending towards Erica Borghard’s and Shawn Lonergan’s definition, this contribution regards cyber proxies as non-state hackers who conduct cyber-attacks or cyber operations in order to achieve “a political objective on behalf of a patron state” (Borghard, Lonergan 2016). It is also important to point out that cyber proxies “can be either individuals or loosely organized units comprised of patriotic hackers, hacktivists or cyber terrorists” (Borghard, Lonergan 2016). Yet, this contribution will focus on patriotic hackers as cyber proxies since they have a greater impact than hacktivists or cyber terrorists. In contrast to hacktivists, patriotic hackers not only engage in civil disobedience, they also get active in actual armed conflicts. Driven by patriotism, patriotic hackers hack with the aim to defend their homeland or national pride whereas hacktivists are essentially activists who are driven by the defence of a political or social issue that does not touch upon their home country or residence. Having said this, we can now focus on the state-proxy relationship.\n\n## 3. The benefits states gain from cyber proxies\n\nMore and more states use cyber proxies because cyber proxies are incredibly useful – they not only enhance the cyber warfare capabilities of the supporting states, they also provide them with a degree of plausible deniability. Cyber proxies are able to avoid attribution as they can launch cyber operations “with little or no attribution” (Applegate 2011). Scott Applegate illustrates that\n\n“[t]hese types of attacks can be carried out inexpensively, with little or no political ramifications to the nation-state, and give the attacker a distinct asymmetric advantage. If a nationstate can covertly initiate, fund, or guide such attacks, (...) [relying on cyber proxies] they can potentially achieve their political objectives without the burden of attribution or the need to adhere to the Law of Armed Conflict” (Applegate 2011).\n\nTherewith, cyber proxies protect governments from the legal consequence of conducting cyber-attacks (Applegate 2011). Similarly, they also shift the problem of attribution. The problem is no longer ‘who carried out the attack’ but rather ‘does the state have/had control and command over the cyber proxies’. The cyber-attacks against Estonia illustrate this. Indeed, Russian patriotic hacker Konstantin Goloskokov has claimed responsibility for the cyber operations. However, the attacks “were in part attributable to the Nashi youth activist group, but it is unclear whether the Russian Federation had a hand in the group’s operations” (Schmitt, Vihul 2014). Related to this, Michael Schmitt and Liis Vihul point out that",
    "Janine Schmoldt\n\n\"the relatively high levels of support that are required before a state can be held responsible for the activities of non-state groups or individuals, as distinct from their own responsibility for being involved, creates a normative safe zone for them\" (Schmitt, Vihul 2014).\n\nAlthough cyber proxies provide plausible deniability, not all states want that as the 2001 cyber-attacks against the U.S. illustrate. In 2001, following the collision of a US EP-3 reconnaissance aircraft and a Chinese F-8 PRC fighter cyber-attack were related to the U.S. (Wu 2007). During this event, the Chinese government was \"not concerned with denying its responsibility for cyber-attacks\" (Hang 2014).

Similarly, in 1999, when Taiwanese President Li Teng-Hui advocated his two-state-theory China again \"launched the Patriotic Hackers and encouraged other hackers to join during the next crisis with Taiwan\" (Hang 2014). Nevertheless, cyber proxies are used to maintain plausible deniability. Next to that, they also enhance the cyber warfare capabilities of states.\n\nAnother reason why states work with cyber proxies is to increase their cyber warfare capabilities. This \"can ensure its ascent to a future superpower status\" (Hjortdal 2011). Cyber proxies are especially relevant for states \"when they lack the capability (...) to conduct offensive cyber attacks\" (Borghard, Lonergan 2016). North Korea for instance \"is incentivized to work with cyber proxies because it lacks indigenous capabilities to conduct independent offensive operations\" (Borghard, Lonergan 2016). Furthermore, states use cyber proxies in order \"to respond to an external threat (i.e., a state adversary)\" (Borghard, Lonergan 2016) or to an internal one. In many cases, cyber warfare capabilities constitute an external threat. The United States for instance threatens China through their cyber warfare capabilities and therewith, they constitute an external threat for China. Because of that, China uses cyber proxies in order to \"ensure eventual strategic parity with the United States in technological and military prowess\" (Hjortdal 2011). However, states also use cyber proxies \"to co-opt potential threats to the regime, employing domestic groups that my pose a risk to regime stability to operate against adversaries, thus enabling the government to monitor those groups and keep them occupied\" (Borghard, Lonergan 2016). This directly leads to the next reason why states use cyber proxies.\n\nThrough the support of cyber proxies states have a certain degree of control through which they can direct cyber proxies away from launching cyber-attacks against the state. Cyber proxies such as patriotic hackers constitute an internal threat especially to China. The cyber-attacks against Indonesia illustrate this. In 1998, many ethnic Chinese living in Indonesia were killed and raped. This constitutes a big dilemma to the Chinese government. One the one hand, the Chinese government could not accept the assaults towards the Chinese ethnicity. But on the other hand, their \"long term foreign policy stance has been not to interfere with other countries internal affairs, and not to be meddled in by foreign powers\" (Wu 2007). Wu highlights: \"If not for the Internet, the Chinese government might have been able to turn a deaf ear toward it and hope it gradually died down\" (Wu 2007). However, Chinese patriotic hackers took \"justice into their own hands\" (Wu 2007) and launched cyber-attacks against Indonesia. Already in 1998 after the Indonesian cyber-attacks, patriotic hackers were able to make Indonesia believe that China declared war. During a press conference on 9 August 1998, the Indonesian government made clear:\n\n\"We hope Chinese people can keep calm. The past events are our internal affairs.

On the contrary, Chinese patriotic hackers launched the attacks on their own initiative by forming the Chinese Hacker Emergency Conference Centre in order to \"set a course of action against Indonesia\" (Denning 2011, Henderson 2007, Wu 2007). Twenty years ago, patriotic hackers were able to alter China's politics. They forced the Chinese government to react. Wu emphasizes that patriotic hackers have the potential to even \"transform China's political structure\" (Wu 2007). Cyber proxies are \"now far better situated to influence political outcomes, even within the international area\" (Hang 2014). Therewith, they constitute an internal threat to nation states. Cyber proxies are powerful actors, supporting them means that they are directed \"away from operating against the state\" (Hang 2014). Because of that domestic political control, China for instance, supports patriotic hackers: \"The People's Republic of China supports Patriotic Hacker attacks to control Patriotic\n\n371",
    "Janine Schmoldt\n\nHackers through fostering nationalism among hackers” (Hang 2014). Next to China also other states such as North Korea or Iran work with cyber proxies. And “even more authoritarian governments have decided that it is better to work with rather than against Patriotic Hackers” (Hang 2014). Through this support, cyber proxies will become more powerful (Hang 2014) because they also benefit from the states.\n\n## 4. The benefits cyber proxies gain from states\n\nIndeed, cyber proxies also benefit from the support they receive from states. Borghard and Lonergan illustrate that “cyber proxies receive asymmetrically greater benefits from governments than the reverse” (Borghard, Lonergan 2016). Through the support of nation states, cyber proxies are able to finance themselves. Furthermore, they can enhance their technical skills through valuable equipment, including soft- and hardware. The fact, that states work with cyber proxies rather than sanction them shows clearly that states somehow also offer legal protection. In exchange for launching cyber-attacks and/or operations, states can provide money or employment. We must be keenly aware of\n\n“the magnitude of the financial incentive for cyber proxies, both in terms of direct transfers of money to groups from the state, and the indirect, but more lucrative, benefit to groups of being able to continue to conduct illegal activities in cyber space” (Borghard, Lonergan 2016).\n\nStates can also provide valuable hard- and software “that may be very expensive or over which they may have a monopoly” (Borghard, Lonergan 2016). With this equipment, cyber proxies can exploit and test their capabilities or even develop other malware and viruses. Except equipment, states “can grant cyber proxies access to the full range of the Internet itself – states can remove restrictions, such as unfettered access and increased bandwidth, enabling the platform to function on an advantageous way for proxies” (Borghard, Lonergan 2016). Furthermore, states can also help to train other cyber proxies, they can “transfer technical knowhow” and even “provide information that can be used to exploit existing vulnerabilities” (Borghard, Lonergan 2016). Therewith, cyber proxies and hackers elevate their political role and they get a voice within the political arena. Operation Allied Force illustrates that cyber proxies can force states to react in the way the proxies want them to. Hackers already have the power to direct states and to influence a political outcome. During Operation Allied Force, the NATO air war against Yugoslavia during the Kosovo War in 1999, the Chinese embassy in Belgrade became accidentally the target of a bombing. As a result, Chinese patriotic hackers conducted cyber-attacks against the U.S. Therewith, “[t]he war in Kosovo has intensified as hackers on either side of the conflict try to take over or block Web servers around the world (...)” (Messmer 1999). This “cyber self-defense war” (Wu 2007) was also a factor why “Washington agreed to pay $28 million for property damage, $4.5 million to the families of the killed and injured, and in April 2000 fired one CIA operations officer involved in the targeting” (Lampton 2002). But the NATO campaign also illustrates another fact: Cyber Proxies or patriotic hackers get active in armed conflicts in order to support their homeland. The Russo-Georgian war of 2008 similarly illustrates that patriotic hackers are involved by conducting cyber-attacks against Georgia in order to defend Russia (Tikk, Kaska, Vihul 2010). In the same year, patriotic hackers were involved in Operation Cast Lead and in Operation Pillar of Cloud during the Gaza War between Palestinians and Israel where they stole lists with contact information of soldiers and reservists and warned them in joining the war (Dahan 2013). The Second Lebanon war, the tensions between Israel and Iran as well as the current conflict in Syria also illustrate that patriotic hackers are involved in armed conflicts. This shows clearly that in theory, international conflicts no longer require a state or state sanction. Cyber proxies from different states fight or hack against each other without governmental direction. The hacker war following the collision of the US EP-3 reconnaissance aircraft and a Chinese F-8 PRC fighter as well the cyber-attacks against Indonesia illustrate this. Cyber proxies can also threaten the internal affairs of a state and therewith the stability of states. All in all, the state’s assistance will enhance the proxies technical and “elevate these hackers into a more prominent political role” (Hang 2014). Rather than sanctioning the illegal activities, states “offer safe haven to cyber proxy groups, both in granting physical security within a state’s sovereign territory, as well as legal protections” (Borghard, Lonergan 2016). Almost all cyber proxies operate outside of the domestic (and international) legal rules and are therefore, susceptible to prosecution and jail. By working with cyber proxies, states are aware of the fact that they refrain from enforcing existing law.\n\n## 5. States, proxies and international law\n\nStates are aware of the activities of the proxies and tolerate them “in spite of having the capacity to do otherwise” (Maurer 2018). In these situations, the states are “clearly turning a blind eye to the proxies’ offensive actions” (Maurer 2018). This however, leads to the question of whether states can be held responsible for the\n\n372",
    "Janine Schmoldt\n\nactions of the cyber proxies under international law. The International Law Commission’s Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts make clear:\n\n“The conduct of a person or group of persons shall be considered an act of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct” (International Law Commission 2001, Article 8).\n\nThus, the actions of cyber proxies are attributable to the state if the hacker is acting under the instruction or direction or control of a State. The degree of control that must be exercised was a key issue for the International Court of Justice (hereafter ICJ) in a Case Concerning the Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States of America). The question was\n\n“whether or not the relationship of the contras to the United States Government was so much one of dependence on the one side and control on the other that it would be right to equate the contras, for legal purposes, with an organ of the United States Government, or as acting on behalf of that Government” (International Court of Justice 1986, para.109).\n\nThe Court applied what has later been called the effective control test. A State can only be held responsible for the acts of non-state actors if the State “directed or enforced” (International Court of Justice 1986, para. 115) the non-state actor. The ICJ thus\n\n“Decides that the United States of America, by training, arming, equipping, financing and supplying the contra forces or otherwise encouraging, supporting and aiding military and paramilitary activities in and against Nicaragua, has acted, against the Republic of Nicaragua, in breach of its obligation under customary international law not to intervene in the affairs of another State” (International Court of Justice 1986, para.3).\n\nThe Appeals Chamber of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia has also addressed the degree of control over non-state actors by making clear:\n\n“One should distinguish the situation of individuals acting on behalf of a State without specific instructions, from that of individuals making up an organised and hierarchically structured group, (...) Consequently, for the attribution to a State of acts of these groups it is sufficient to require that the group as a whole be under the overall control of the State” (International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia 1999, para. 120).\n\nSpecific instructions are not required for the actions of individuals, as opposed to the effective control test, where specific instructions or directions concerning the performance of an action are required in order to attribute the action to a state. The Chamber thus identified another degree of control, namely the overall control test:\n\n“In order to attribute the acts of a military or paramilitary group to a State, it must be proved that the State wields overall control over the group, not only by equipping and financing the group, but also by coordinating or helping in the general planning of its military activity. Only then can the State be held internationally accountable for any misconduct of the group” (International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia 1999, para. 131).\n\nIn the case of cyber proxies, it seems clear, that states have effective and/or overall control over the proxies, especially through the relationship of delegation, orchestration, and sanctioning. States can be held responsible for the actions of a cyber proxies under international law if they have effective and/or overall control or more precisely, if the cyber proxy is acting on the instructions, direction, or control of that state.\n\n## 6. Conclusion\n\nMore and more states work with cyber proxies due to three facts. First, cyber proxies avoid attribution and provide plausible deniability. Therewith, they protect states from the legal consequence that (illegal) cyber operations may cause. Second, cyber proxies enhance the cyber warfare capabilities of states when they lack offensive cyber capabilities. Third, cyber proxies co-opt threats as states gain a certain degree of control over the hacker through which they can direct cyber proxies away from launching cyber-attacks against the state. On the other hand, cyber proxies receive greater benefits from states which lead to the fact that their power will inevitably grow. By gaining a state’s support, cyber proxies can finance themselves and enhance their technical skills. Therewith, cyber proxies can not only develop new tools they can also train other hackers. Furthermore,\n\n373",
    "Janine Schmoldt\n\nstates offer legal protection with the result, that hackers will not be prosecuted for illegal cyber operations. However, states who work with cyber proxies are responsible for the actions and operations of the proxies, if the proxies are acting on the instructions, directions, or overall and/or effective control of that state. All in all, cyber proxies get “a seat at the table of political change” (Hang 2014). Cyber proxies can already threaten the internal affairs of a state and therewith the stability of states as past cyberwars have shown.\n\n## References\n\nApplegate, S.D.

    "abstract": "More and more states support cyber proxies. States work with proxies rather than sanctioning them. This is because cyber proxies are incredibly useful – they not only enhance the cyber warfare capabilities of the supporting states, they also provide them with a degree of plausible deniability. This ascent a future superpower status. China for instance uses cyber proxies in order to \"deter the United States (...) which may ensure eventual strategic parity with the United States in technological and military prowess\" (Hjortdal 2011). Simultaneously, cyber proxies are seen as an inherent threat to the stability of nation states as they are capable of subverting the national and political stability. Is then the support of cyber proxies not inconsistent with the aim to limit potential threats to the stability of nation states? Through the support of nation states, cyber proxies can enhance their technical skills with the result, that they elevate their political role. Cyber proxies have become extremely powerful, supporting them means that they are directed \"away from operating against the state\" (Hang 2014). Thus, even more governments have decided that it is better to work with rather than against cyber proxies. But this also leads to the question of whether states can be held responsible under international law for the actions of the cyber proxies and hackers.",
